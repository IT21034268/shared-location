4,SS Elmo backpack,"This backpack is soft, cuddly and adorable. It has a small pocket large enough for a small box of crayons, but not much more, however this backpack is for small children so it's not really a problem."
1,Doesn't work on Sony T.V's,"I bought this bracket and i have a 40"" and 46"" Sony T.V's and the screws don't go in all the way on the left side which makes me worry about the bracket holding my tv on the wall. don't buy it if you have asony tv."
2,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR ...,"The price is good the design is nice, but make sure to check their website if this mount is for you. I too thought the screws to the TV was too short like the last customer who rated this a 1 star. I have a 40' Samsung and the bar for the bottom is too long (electric plug is in its way). I will have to cut it one day. I also had a missing piece when I ordered it so I called customer service for a replacement part. MAIN THING IS CHECK THE WEBSITE FOR THE CORRECT MOUNT/MODEL FOR YOU. THE PRICE MAYBE NICE, BUT IT ISNT NICE IF IT DOESNT LOOK GOOD OR SAFE."
1,poor engineering,Item being reviewedSanus VMAA18 Articulating Mount -this mount does not accomodate consumer reports #1 rated plasma hdtv [panasonic th-50pz700u]. the tv has a bump out that prevents mounting unless you purchase extra hardware.
4,Works fine with Sony,"I just installed this with a new Sony 46-inch LCD. The design and construction of the bracket is of very high quality, and with the adjustments provided, the tension of the movement can be finely adjusted. Overall I am very happy with this product.As mentioned in other reviews, the instructions are not great: basic drawings with few words (provided in every language imaginable). You need to be handy with tools to install this product. They provide a wide variety of screws for mounting to all HDTV products. In my case, the screws of the size that fit the Sony mounting holes came in short, medium and long lengths. The short ones were too short. The medium ones were just a little too long. So I used two extra washers (my own) and got a nice fit. The lag bolts, with some lubrication, went into the studs just fine, and made for a solid mount. The unit gives you the ability to make fine level and tensioning adjustments, and ties to route cables."
5,A British view,"For some reason, The Long Ryders always seemed more popular in the UK than the USA. I still remember hearing 'Looking for Lewis and Clark on breakfast radio and thinking ""What a great riff!"" I even managed to catch them live once, in a poorly attended nightclub gig in Bristol. This double CD brings it all back. From the early classics like Run Dusty Run through the material from State of our Union and beyond, every track is a gem. I was particular impressed with the unreleased demos - if these are demos, the final versions would have had a lot to live up to! The closing Neil Young cover ""Prisoners of Rock'n'Roll"" kind of sums up the band's career - locked in an unappreciative world, fighting against the forces of bland music!"
4,Fun escape,"I went through a phase of heavy political novels, and Lulu was a serious breath of fresh air. A big part of the fun is the dish on the gallery world of New York City. Sadly, the protagonist is underdeveloped and plot vapid...but I think that's what I signed up for. If you're looking for a relaxing peek into the gallery world and you're not expecting a literary masterpiece, I think, like me, you will enjoy Lulu."
4,Fun summer reading,"If you enjoy gallery openings and occasionally buying a local artist's painting for over the sofa, like we do, you'll enjoy this gossipy, witty peek into the serious art world. Welcome to the next level. I bought this book for my wife, but then got hooked in. Nothing complicated here: There's a MacGuffin, and everybody wants it. It's the ""everybody""--the colorful characters--that make this worth reading. Take it to the beach, or take it on a plane. Don't take it too seriously."
2,Groan.....,"A trite and altogether shallow piece. Really misses the mark and tries too hard to be clever, allusive (who is THIS?) and glib. A missed opportunity and a forgetable effort. Too bad. Was looking forward."
2,Lulu meets God and Doubts Him,"This book just didn't appeal to me. The characters were well done, but bored me. I was disappointed because the blurb attracted me to it. Someone else may love it, but not I! Genre of art dealing was well done."
2,2 Stars for effort,"Save your money for the penny sale rack. Story is trite, sophomoric and insipid. However, I applaud her for trying."
1,The book jacket is better written then what's inside!,"This book is supposed to be an inside look at the narcissism and decadence of the art world. The irony here, is that it is . . . but not in the way Ms. Ganek intends. A wealthy art patron herself, the fact the she wrote this, believing she had something interesting to say and then someone published it . . . makes the circumstances surrounding this insipid work -- the quintessential ""Emperors New Clothes"" story and far more revealing and interesting then what fills the 277 dull pages of Ms. Ganek's novel."
2,bait and switch,"The title is interesting and makes you think there might be something in the book that relates to a young woman finding God and then having second thoughts about it. But really, the book is about the art world, which is of no interest to me. There is some small effort to tie in the transcendence an artist feels when creating with a nearness to God, but the connection is flimsy and not worth the rest of the soap opera art gallery silliness."
3,Good soap opera read...,"If you're in the mood for a good soap opera, then get this book. If not, stear clear...However, still recommending to my mother for a good, fun read..."
3,Good read for a cold winter day,"Light, fluffy, funny - read it and forget about the cold weather for a day. Nice way to spend time when you don't want to go out."
2,What was the big deal?,"After reading review in NYT I was made to feel that if I didn't read this book I would be culturally deprived. Was I set up for a big disappointment? Moderately interesting, surely forgettable, this novel could have benefited from some rewrites and a little editing. Obviously a novice attempt at fiction, not the greatest thing since Jane Austen."
2,Predictable and trite,"This novel begins with some promise - the characters have potential and the writing is not bad. However, somewhere around the middle of the book, it is almost as if the author loses interest or time - the writing becomes hackneyed and the plot is predictable. There is little attention to detail beyond clear stereotypes of ""gallerinas"" and the new rich collectors of the art world."
1,Lulu Meets God and (......zzzzzzzz.........),"In response to an earlier amazon.com review, I don't really care if Ms. Ganek is a 'newly rich wife,' old money, or a poor student.The real issue for me in the case of this book is that it reduces the artworld and its inhabitants into cliched sterotypes. Writing a novel based on these cliches and sterotypes, together with a bland style (one only wishes that Ms. Ganek had refined a literary style), results in a rather dreary and boring attempt at a first novel. The character development is thin, and the plot device(s) a bit ham-fisted and obvious. Whilst a decidely good first student attempt, I suppose, this should have never made it through to publication. It's simply not good enough.Granted, not every writer needs to be Joyce, Pynchon, or Patrick White (and neither should they), but if one wishes to create a breezy, engaging, enjoyable, toss-away novel, well, there IS an art to that form as well.Definitely NOT recommended reading."
3,"Sharp knivens, but aluminum handles feel cheap","Note that this is the same product asRada Cutlery Six Serrated Steak Knives Gift Set, 6 Pc Boxed Set, Made in USA, Aluminum Handles (S6S), but with two additional tools. Overall, the quality seems high -- forged steel, quality serration, excellent cutting power. But the aluminum handles give the knives an extremely lightweight feeling, like they are just a toy. Overall, I'm satisfied with the effectiveness of the tool, but I wish the handles were made of a weightier material."
3,Readers Digest Version of James Last,"Not one of the best albums. Great Last music, but with 50 songs on one CD you are just getting snippets of each song. It does make a nice party CD, but leaves you hungry for the full versions."
3,another one missed by the studios for transfer to dvd,"I have watched this whenever it is shown on the televsionA very good cast,Very.There are not any shots filled withviolence,flames and explosions. Just a good old fashionedschool-boys own adventure. Iwish there had been more likethis from the studios!"
4,Very Imformitive,I found this book to be very helpful. I am looking for help in reestablishing credit. It seems that there is very little help out there. I found the credit reporting agencies very unfair in there practices and this book helps inform consumers.
3,Why not do the lot?,"According to the articles I've read online,If you buy Volume 1 & 2, you'll get:18 of the 28 Lone Ranger storiesAll 13 of the Zorro stories.The way I see it, this leaves them with 10 Lone Rangers and no Zorro stories for a potential Volume 3.14 Lone Ranger stories per volume would have wrapped things up nicely for both shows.I can only hope they still put out a 3rd volume anyway, to give us the remaining Lone Ranger stories.Failing that, I'll feel rather disgruntled about having spent my money on the first two volumes, but it's too early to complain yet.A similar project is possibly in the pipeline combining Waldo Kitty with Fraidy Cat. Hopefully, they'll cover all the episodes.To me, it would have seemed more apt to put the 28 Lone Ranger stories out as one DVD set, and the 13 Zorro stories out as another.And who knows what it will take to motivate the Edgar Rice Burroughs legacy holders to put out the Tarzan cartoons."
3,Les Tubes from Canada,"I haven't actually heard this album but I did some research for those like me that thought The Tubes (from San Francisco) had an rare/obscure album called Max. This is actually a group called Les Tubes, and they are from Canada. Since you can't give a review without a rating, I put 3 stars to be fair. It's too bad that Amazon can't differentiate between bands/artists with similar names."
2,Review of the items purchased,"It came like new; haven't used it yet, but looks sharp and I think it willwork well. The product came fast and in good condition."
1,unbelievably bad,"cheap small flimsy, serrations to big and wide apart for any usefull use. id have sent it back but not worth the cost.don't waste your money. it might be somewhat usefull for some of the things the other reviewers say they use it for, but a plain old knife would work better. anything would work better. this would be a good gag prize or a present for someone you don't like. unbelievable waste of money."
4,A BIT SMALL,"MY OLD SERRATED CHOPPER WAS LARGER IN DIAMETER AND THE HANDLE WAS A BIT LONGER, MAKING FOR A MORE COMFORTABLE GRIP FOR MY MEDIUM-SIZE HANDS. EVEN SO, I LOOK FORWARD TO USING THE SHARP BLADE FOR CHOPPING NUTS, MOSTLY. THIS CHOPPER SHOULD MAKE FOR QUICK WORK."
1,Poor performance,"I never used a chopper before, and this one does a poor job on onions and peppers. The serrated blade is the main issue, as it will not slice through the skin of a pepper effectively, with the point sticking in it and dragging it along. You will need to cut up items first and then chop quite a few times to get them to the desired size. A straight blade chopper would be a better choice."
4,best value,"i shopped around a lot before actually purchasing this for a trip... best value out there since you get the car charger and the wall charger. Stupid that the Zune doesnt just come with a wall charger... how much would this cost Microsoft? $0.50 to produce?Works well, no issues so far, and if you have the USB cable that you use to charge/sync your Zune, you can use that with this charger as well.Sweet deal for the price."
2,DLO Power Kit,Charges slow. The Zoon connector split open the first day. I snapped it back together. It works for now. Cheap flimsy plastic made in China. Buy the Microsoft charger.
3,It's Ok,"The only reason I gave this product three stars was because the USB cable shipped with the package didn't work. Luckily I had a spare USB that did work in my house already.Other than that, the charger works great with my car and now I have an extra wall-charger whose prongs fold (retractable).No complaints really; just a bad USB.Order arrived fast (about four days, weekend included).The DLO brand is one of the few electronics that work rather well with Zune products."
5,EVERYTHING THAT IS NEEDED FOR MY ZUNE 120,The accessories in the box are complete. Car charger and outlet charger for the the Zune. It all works fine.
5,I love it!!,"I just got this album on a whim and I can't believe how good it is! Nice work gentlemen, I'm sorry you never got the credit you deserve for this album and I hope this can make up for it a little. Had been old enough I would have been hanging around your garage!! Cheers!"
1,This is NOT THE 80's band,Don't be fooled into thinking this was the incredible 80's band out of Canada. IT IS NOT. It is a sixties band out of Phoenix. AND IT SUCKS. (Mostly because I was expecting the 80's band based on the reviews). Shame on Amazon for letting reviews stay up that leads one to believe it was them. Unless you like poorly recorded late sixties music (it sounds like a bad LP) Don't bother. It would probably cost me more to return it at this point; wish I hadn't wasted the money!
2,What a disappointment.,"What happened to the Grapes of Wrath from the 80s? Now that was a great band, but the band reflected on this album is a huge disappointment. They've lost sight of the soul and sounds they once had and traded it in for some Beatles-wanna-be music. Too bad. But I'll keep listening to their earlier music anyway."
5,My kid loves it!!,"Very good product.Durable, it doesn't leaks at all.My 16 month year old son lobes to play with it."
4,Rhinestone - Dolly Parton & Sylvester Stallone,"I collect Dolly Parton movies and this was my last one because I thought that it wouldn't be any good. But it was surprisingly funny!! As long as you don't expect too much from it, you will enjoy. It's a bit of fun and some good songs to sing along to. I'm glad I have it and have seen it a few times already. (The soundtrack is great too, if you can get a copy.)Sylvester Stallone isn't over the top macho - and while he's not the best singer, he can hold a tune. And Dolly is just Dolly. It's a good laugh and worth a watch."
1,Cinematic Plague,"A list of 7 things you need to have before watching this film:1. Knitting Needles - to jab yourself in the eyes and scrotum at appropriate times (namely the opening titles and anytime during the space filling the gap of time until the end credits)2. The names and numbers of the closest paramedics, veterinarian and morgue3. A list of 5 reasons to live (for quick spot-checking)4. Rectal thermometer (you'll know when it happens)5. A serum consisting of equal parts mole remover, saltpeter and some sort of fish paralyzer6. A bag full of bunny farts (to aid w/hyperventilation)7. And finally, complicity with the theory that Sylvester Stallone is an alien life form sent here to reap carnage on mankind, capable of single-handedly destroying art and culture with little more than a typewriter and the ability to form catastrophic phrases out of seemingly benign language (i.e. GURU OF DOODOO)...run...for the love of all that is holy...run."
2,So bad it's good.,"Okay, I have to admit that I've watched this movie more than once. It IS pretty darn awful. Sylvester Stallone has absolutely no business attempting to sing, or do comedy schtick. Or do anything besides star in Rocky 1, for that matter.But, I had to give it two stars just for the pure cheese value of it. The jokes are so bad that they're kind of funny (i.e.: ""Okay, you can show me yer organ. But it best be havin' music comin' out of it!""). Stallone's extreme bad acting/overacting is amusing. I love the contrived way they build up Dolly Parton's character at the beginning to show how very thoughtful she is, like by lending money to her co-workers and not expecting to be paid back (??). No, other reviewers, sorry to say, the songs are not good. They're not! They're badly written hillbilly hick trash. But, honestly, it's all part of the fun. Aren't you ever in the mood for a bad movie?"
3,Rhinestone,"The movie arrived in exellent condition. With Stallone being more commonly known for his action movies, he gives it a reasonable shot at this genre. Dolly gave a good performance too. It's not a movie I could sit down and watch a lot but I don't mind watching it now and then. It's good to be able to sit back and relax watching an off-beat movie."
3,Rocky Pygmalion,"OK...This is NOT A CLASSIC. However, I am doing a Intro to English course and I needed 2 films based on the Pygmalion and Galataea Myth. I paired this with SHE'S ALL THAT and they turned out to make a good study set. It would have been nice IF Dolly Parton and Stallone had ANY CHEMISTRY together. They BOTH were acting like cartoon characters in TWO DIFFERENT FILMS. The film was SO 80's at times that it was PAINFULLY funny. EXCELLENT TO REVIEW as an artifact that was buried for good reasons."
3,Rhinstone,"The product arrived quickly and the Disc was ok, however the DVD case was cracked and broken. The dvd recording was of good quality."
2,its funny in a ironic way,"although i think stallone does his best ""acting"" in the rocky movies, and not much else. for a stallone movie it is,funny, yes the jokes are corny. but the movie and jokes are soo cheesy that what makes it funny. if you watch this film,just keep your expectations low.and no; this movie probaly wont be on your top 10 fave list of movies. you still will get a chuckle from this movie, it will take your mind off your troubles for awhile."
2,Camp classic: Watch Sly sing country!,"I love this movie so much, and have since I was young, yet I just can't give it a higher score than this. Sly is an irreverent cabbie, picked out of the crowd by good ole Dolly and her manager to become the next big thing at a local country club. What ensues is classic 80's camp with little more than guilty fun at the expense of good taste.The greatest part of this film is the first real Sly song, ""Drinkenstein,"" performed while wearing an outrageous get-up that is beyond the imagination. That song won the movie a much deserved Golden Raspberry as did Sly's brilliant acting performance. No extras to speak of, but who needs em. You'll probably be too drunk while watching this to care, but it'll give you time to practice your jock-itch walk!"
1,"Yuk, yuk, yecch!","This film is as funny as a case of hemorrhoids, and about as irritating. If you want to see Sylvester Stallone at his funniest, watch him try to do straight drama. Yo, Rock, dis movie stinks, do youse know what I mean?"
1,I Walked Out of the Theater,A horribly miscast pairing of two stars who have done much better in their own films. The story is trite and unbelievable. Some of the dialogue seems off the cuff and unrehearsed. Save your time and money and avoid this turkey like the Plague.
2,Two stars one for each of Dolly's doll parts,"This is one of those ""it's so bad it's not good but passes as funny"". The one note jokes about Dolly's you know whats promote groans, but the guys will like them. But, I discovered Richard Farnsworth! What a handsome older man with piercing blue eyes! Sadly, he's passed away since, but I've really enjoyed his performance in other movies like ""Misery"". Enjoy!"
1,The worst movie ever made???,"My disappointment while writing this review stems from the fact that I can't give a rating of negative stars for this cinematic fiasco. Apparently Sly Stallone reeling from his success of his Rocky movies(I believe 3 at this time) feels that he can do anything. Alas, I'm sure anyone who with a meager education who was swindled, bamboozled, and hoodwinked into suffering through this Hollywood disaster would be happy if Sly could act.Whats really astounding is the fact that there is somebody in the world who sings worse than Sly's brother and that would be Sly himself.The nicest word I could use to describe this movie would be ""contrived"". I wrote better scripts when I was in grade school. Dolly, prior to her late eighties reconstruction, parades about with a body thats best described as a mutation of the female form.Do yourself a favor and stab your eyes out before watching this movie. I wish I would have."
3,It's not bad for the price...but I'm waiting on the rebate.,"This is a pretty good drive. I recently bought it from Circuit City at the same price after having ordered a 10GB 5400RPM with a new system I just built. I had to have a 7200...there's just too big of a difference if you're running any Windows product in boot up time.I would have preferred Maxtor but they didn't carry them, but this has been worth the price so far...considering i get my REBATE check. If this takes months or if I never get it then this drive gets a 2.Overall, good sized drive, decent speed and is ATA66 compatible. Not bad at all."
2,Captain Beefheart and the Tragic Band,Not the album to buy for good Beefheart. This one is interesting only as a document of the low point of his musical career.
3,"Makes great eggs, but the finish isn't so durable","The pan heats very evenly, food does not stick at all, and a simple wipe with a sponge is all that's needed to get the pan clean. After a year of daily use, however, the finish is in really bad shape. Perhaps our melamine utensils are to blame? Given what we paid for the pan, we're pretty disappointed with it from a durability standpoint."
5,My Favorite Pan,"Easy to clean, great for the oven too. It's a good size and a perfect addition to your kitchen. I absolutely love mine!!!"
2,"Like Bush, Mediocre","I was disappointed in the quality of the cartoons. Sorry, but I had expected some from the top-flight editorial cartoonists of America. These seem to be confined to one service. You won't want to use this review, I'm sure."
1,Not so fast...,"This book highlights the author, his boyfriend and a few other cartoonists, leaving out the giants (Oliphant, Toles, Danziger, Conrad, Sack, etc.) in the field. Skip this one and wait for the Best of 2005/6 (which, alas, is also to be edited by Gagle leaving the numerous repetitive contributions in question as to their relevance under the banner ""Best""."
2,The 1980's victimize yet another rock legend,"When one thinks of Gene Clark, the word ""organic"" comes to mind. This disc was produced at the moment when analog was about to cede to digital and record companies were no longer concentrating on artist development. It's decidedly not organic. While the songs were not up to his usual standard, the production doesn't help this set either. There are no drum machines and synthesizers clogging the tracks, but the production is still dated in that indescribable ""on the cusp of the Emulator"" fashion. I would have preferred two brand new original tunes over remakes of ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" (with complete lyrics) or ""Set You Free This Time"". Recommended for Clark completists only. For beginners, see ""Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers"", a fine stepping stone from his Byrds era to his singer-songwriter period."
3,What to look for..,"Good faucet, but having all the holes for sprayer, etc is a pain. When something stops working, you are left with just holes, which is not attractive. The solution is to manufacture a cover plate with NO holes."

4,body language-special efx,"I was kind of worried when I ordered this, I prefer some of the earlier special efx, but it is a good solid cd."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this cap. It looks nothing like the photo provided. Cheap, flimsy, and fit my 6'4"" perfectly. Not for children and I even got the smaller size. I bought the 12 pack for roughly the price that this one was and it was a lot better quality n I had party favors too all for the same price! Will be returning!"
1,Junk,This product is such a piece of junk it actually deserves a warning. It barely even resembles a hat. More like a flimsy piece of randomly shaped fabric stitched to a piece of cheap cardboard. It barely fits my adult head. Fit a youth? Forget it. It's so un-hat-like it's actually hard to put into words.
1,This is NOT the hat i received!,The hat i got was literally a flat square sheet of thin fabric w/ a bill attached. You're meant to drape it over your head i guess an then attach w/ the plastic adjustors (not velcro as shown here) in back. Besides being ridiculous its also huge and fit my own head. I would barely call what i got a 'hat'! Needless to say im returning it.
1,Low quality material,"It looks good on the web, but it is made of low quality material. Sewing work was so poor, and I had to return it."
3,a number of individual truths,"To steal a line from another reviewer ""Crusading environmental journalist Jeffrey St. Clair has written a devastating tale of corporate plunder, political hypocrisy and ecological loss."" Too bad my copy was printed on virgin not recycled paper. This is a great book for paranoid earth first types who ignore the good and focus on the bad. It tells one side of the story very well. A side that needs to be brought to the fore but I personally am put off by the unwillingness to look at all aspects of the environmental movement. While the focus on a number of individual truths is not necessarily a 'lie' it most likely is also not the 'truth'. Books like this are written for the already indoctrinated not those looking for enlightenment. I suspect dollars had more to do with St. Clair's motivation than concern for the environment."
5,Good things in small packages.,"This book is amazing! As a student nurse, we are required to have our Medsurg book at the clinical site. Those of you that have seen the book can agree that you can seriously hurt someone with that book; I mean it is huge! This companion has been a life-saver in every way. It is compact, has all the pertinent information, and is easy to read. I truly recommend it to all nursing students. Good Luck!"
4,Clinical Companion,Great book to use when at clinicals. Has almost any disorder/disease in it that you will need! I would recommend getting a more updated version! But overall this is from 2000 and is still a good book!
4,Quick reference and review of exemplar diseases.,"This is a good book for reviewing information about major diseases, over 200 of them covered in the book. It gives the description, patho (on some), clinical manifestations, diagnostics, complications, collaborative care, and nursing management with goals and interventions. It doesn't have every disease you'll run into, just the most common ones. It is a brief synopsis of the Med-Surg book, so I find it helpful for reviewing for quizzes and questioning from instructors during clinical."
5,Handy,I bought this because I cannot take the larger text book with me all the time. I use this at clinical as a nursing student and it is WONDERFUL!
1,not needed,"If this book is not required, don't bother getting it, I have not used it once since i bought it, seemed like every time I went to look something up in it, it wasn't in there."
3,Bongos In The Mist,"For anybody who knows the ways of the bongos for Donkey Kong Jungle Beat and Donkey Konga 1 and 2 for the Nintendo Gamecube, many of them know you have to have a pair of bongo controllers for the game. Pelican has offered a substitute for the original DK bongos for the Gamecube. The Pelican bongos, are a bit bulkier and larger than the original ones Nintendo made. They definitely work very well as a alternative if you can't find the ones for the Gamecube. However, it isn't really worth the price. Considering that you can actually by a pair of bongo controllers with a deluxe version of either the Donkey Konga games or Donkey Kong Jungle Beat. Many who have a huge interest in any of those games shouldn't consider this copycat beater, and just the ones Nintendo developed.Bongos: CPrice: C-"
5,Clever Item,"Had never seen this type of product anywhere else, I sent it to my grandson, he was impressed!"
2,Shoe wallet,"I was disapointed in the product. The details of what you can carry in it is boges. I needed something I could put my military ID card in when exercising but it does not hold a ID card, it is too little. Heck, it is barely big enough to hold one key. So, at the low price it is not worth the money."
4,Handy but wish it was a tiny bit bigger,I use this shoe wallet when I go out for walks around the neighborhood. It is nice not to have keys jingling in you pocket . I don't always have pockets on my clothes so that is when this is especially handy. It is easy to put on my shoe and take off. I don't even notice it when it is on. My only complaint is that my DL or credit card does not fit inside. You have to put it underneath with the elastic strap to hold it. It works fine and stays snug but it would be nicer if it fit in with the key. Otherwise I love this and recommend it.
1,Don't buy it!!,The shoe wallet won't even hold my debit card- only hold 1 key and you have to fold the money a few times to get it to fit!! The wallet also arrived 2 1/2 weeks later than was promised. Easier just to carry my keys!!
2,Shoe Wallet Review.,"I am an avid runner and have used a lot of different running gear and accessories. The Shoe Wallet is not worth the price. There are much better Shoe wallet/pockets on the market. The Nathan Shoe Pocket Plus being one of them. If you are going to put your valuables (i.e. Key, ID and/or money) in a shoe pocket you want to ensure that it is secure and protected. The Shoe Wallet pouch itself is not big enough to hold your ID/Drivers License, etc... Securing your ID card/credit card by a restraining band on the back of the pouch is not ensuring it is secure.The Shoewallet for walkers, runners & travelers"
4,Haven't lost anything yet,Great for running. I've used mine for a year and a half now and it's about time I replaced it because the velcro has gone a bit. You lace the strap through your shoe laces and then over the top to the velcro Keys go in the pocket and cards go in the elastic strap on the back. It's a little silly that they made the pocket tapered so that you can't put your cards inside it but this thing is a lot better that putting my key in my bra like I was doing before.
2,"Great idea, just can't fit basic id cards","I had an old shoe wallet that worked great from adidas but lost it in my last move. I ordered this thinking that replacing it would be easy. Unfortunately, this does not fit id-sized items. My drivers license, metro card, credit card and housekey usually come with on my runs. This does not work for that. Cash and a key work but don't fit my purposes."
3,"Good info, but needs a little work","First, let me say that I DO recommend this book. There are a lot of good profiles of the Nieuport fighters, including French, British, Italian, Belgian, and Russian aircraft.There are a lot of profiles, but few (if any) overhead views. There is no index. (A problem with several early Qsprey books.) There are pilots described with no aircraft profiles, and there are profiles of pilots that are not described in the book!Still, there is a lot of good info, especially if you are new to the world of WW1 aircraft. The main focus is on the Nieuport 17, although there are profiles of all models. (I was disappointed that there were no profiles of British Nieuport 11's, even though there are several photos in the book.)So, good book for under $20."
1,WARNING: NO RCA JACKS ON THE BACK OF UNIT,"While this is a beautiful piece of equipment that seems to have a ton of features--I'm impressed, even without turning it on to sample the sound quality--I would warn any potential buyer that it does not include any kind of input jacks (RCA or otherwise) on the back of the unit. I bought mine with the intention of connecting it to my DVR and DVD player. I was shocked to discover that this won't be possible unless I run my cables into the FRONT of the unit. Sure, it will function that way. But it spoils not simply the unit's aesthetic appeal but the clean look of my entire entertainment center. What was SHARP thinking when they designed this? Are these the same designers who put the on/off switches on the BACK of the first personal computers? In my experience, this is a rare instance where Amazon is shucking a significantly deficient product. I am not pleased and will be returning mine promptly . . . ."
4,Not bad for the price,"At first, I thought $88,929 for a memory card holder? No way it's that good. But then I realized they are selling it for $9.99, which I feel is a fair price for this product. If it goes back up to $88,929 I would say hold off for something cheaper, but in the meantime it's a steal."
3,Damaged guitar,"Just got my guitar tonight and was so excited. Opened it up and saw a really good looking guitar, but moments later i noticed a glaring crack on the back of the guitar neck. The white bit that holds the strings in line at the top was also shifted out of place, which is probably the cause of the crack. Despite the good reviews this guitar has been getting, there are some issues with shoddy workmanship. Gonna call their customer service tomorrow to return it.EDIT : Returned the guitar and they replaced it while paying for shipping, Got a new mint version a few days later. Really nice guitar and it's a steal for it's price too. Their customer service was helpful as well, bump up to 3 stars."
2,looks aren't everything,For my 2nd guitar I bought this model. I gave this guitar 2 stars because of how it looks. It has a very nice finish and looks very good. That's about all the positives I can see. Mine developed a crack under the neck about 2 months after I got it. Unfortunately Rogue has no manufactures warranty. So now I'm stuck with a defective guitar. I would highly recommend buying a 3rd party warranty if you do decide to buy this model. I would recommend the Epiphone DR 100 at the same price over this model. That is what I got to replace this one and I am much happier with it. Easier to play and sounds better plus it has a lifetime warranty.
4,A must for fans of Wes and/or trad. English folk music,This is an excellent collection of tunes. The arrangements are sparse(usually just guitar and vocal) but quite beautiful. The respect and love that Wes has for these songs and the underappreciated Nic Jones really comes through in the music.
1,This CD is better in its case than in the player,"A total waste of possible talent, this CD is just awful on so many levels. Wes is off-key in many of the songs, and his voice is unconvincing and irregular. In theory this album is a good idea, but the execution is so painful. I've really tried to get into this CD, but in the end, I taped it to the ceiling in my office, so nobody has to listen to it."
1,"A weak version of ""om""","As a student of meditation for 30 years, I was hoping this CD would facilitate Out-of-body. I found it to be a little irritating and not effective. I find that listening to ""real"" East Indian music is much more effective than this particular CD."
5,"Michelangeli is good, an obsessive to perfection for any composer","Michelangeli takes the music of Mozart with a sound clarity wonderful, impressive, in which the details are emphasized."
5,This is not just a sex manual!,"""Before New York,"" Charles Wehrenberg's epic study of what really happened, of how we became who we are, knocked me off my feet with its hypothetical prescience. I could not pout it down! Once I finished, I held up its claims in my mind's eye (the very first Kindle), and compared them with the claims made in the conspiracy of our history books. Wehrenberg's are clearly better researched, presented more believable, and make good sense as well as involving higher drama. I wish I had been able to read this back in the ninth grade--and I'll ask my children to do so when they reach that age. But it's never too late to expand one's perspective, and general understanding. In addition to everything else, this book is a great love story!--Richard A. McDonough"
4,Totally engrossing,This fascinating espionage tale is completely based on true events and facts. You're drawn into the historical time and place before you know it! A well-written and well-researched engrossing read.
2,had potential but,I had to read this book for a class i took. I found the book to long and very confusing.
2,Not Much on Quebec City,"There's not much in this book about Quebec City (11 pages to be exact). I bought it for an upcoming trip to Quebec City. I was very disappointed and found it practically useless. I don't think ""Quebec City"" should be part of the title. If you want a book that's mostly about Montreal, this might suffice; but I wasn't overly impressed with that part either. There are a lot of photos of people that could have been taken almost anywhere. I have bought several Insight Guides that are much better than this one."
5,Rob McConnell and the Boss Brass - Two Originals,"Even though this album has been around for over 20 years, there is no better jazz album that I have listened to. This is a great album, with an all-star cast of players. I never knew that Moe Koffman was as great on sax as he was on the flute.For anyone who likes jazz, this is a must-have album."
4,Best and Only If you have the machine,You have to have the machine to brew this product. It is youronly choice for the Bosch beverage maker. No competition. Thetaste of each coffee is up to the person's own preference in tastes.
5,One of my Favs,This is one of my favorite brews for my Tassimo machine. I drink this practically everyday and am never disappointed. I recommend this as as staple to your Tassimo collection.
2,Extremely bitter.,This coffee is extremely bitter. You can't drink this coffee without some sort of milk or creamer (unless you prefer that sort of thing). I tried the original Gevalia coffee (non Crema brand) and it tastes better in my opinion.
3,Too bland,"This coffee is bland and somewhat weak to me. But I'm a Starbucks fan - so I really enjoy the full flavor, richness, and even burnt flavor that those coffees offer. So you could read this - if I enjoy Starbucks then I most likely will not be so crazy about this coffee; if I really think Starbucks is horrible then there's a chance I'll like this."
2,Wish I could say it was better,"Don't be dissappointed in your machine if this is the first T-disc flavor you've tried. It's not your Tassimo, it's the coffee blend. I used to subscribe to Gevalia's delivery service so I've tried a lot of their automatic drip coffees, incl Signature Blend. I'm very dissapointed in the Tassimo disc version. I gave it 2 stars just for smoothness, but otherwise this is a lackluster brew. Not much richness, body, or flavor other than generic ""coffee"". The ""crema"" is not much more than window dressing on a pretty boring cup. My husband, who is far less picky about coffee than I am, agreed. Do yourself a favor & try the other coffees available for the Tassimo, incl on their website. The Gevalia Espresso is good, so are the Maxwell House Latte & Capuccino."
2,Very weak,"Based on the reviews here, I had high hopes for this coffee. I realize it's a mild coffee, but it is really lacking taste and just seems very watery. I tried making a smaller cup, which did help a little, but I'm still disappointed. I won't be purchasing this one again. I wonder if this is typical of Gevalia t-discs, cause I was disappointed in the Gevalia Capp as well (the Maxwell House is WAY better)."
2,Watery and lousy...,"I'm a huge fan of almost every variety of hot beverages the Tassimo makes... this is not one of them. If you make a full cup, it tastes very lackluster and watery. The head of foam is very thin and disappears very quickly. Both of these problems can be improved by making a smaller cup, but even so, it still doesn't hold a candle to other flavors.If you want a GREAT cup of Tassimo crema, go for the Mastro Lorenzo Crema. HUGE improvement in taste, and the foam is nice and thick.Tassimo makes lots of great drinks... but skip this one."
2,Watery and Bitter Bad combination,"I'm giving this 2 stars because possibly this is just not to my liking for my taste buds.I do not like my coffee with this kind of biting almost citric after taste. It simply gives me sour stomach and my stomach doesn't get that way easily.I enjoy a strong cup of hearty bold flavor once in a while, but this is too biting for me. Adding sugar? No help. It also seems watery. I try to focus my t-disc investments into the flavors I love, and purge the losers. With a full box remaining I'm going to need to toss these. Also misleading picture on the cover, which gives the impression of a milk based mixture. Their ""Crema"" is simply whipped bitter ""air""."
4,My opinion,This book looks at love from all the angles possible. Its an amazing reading. I would recommend it for all those with romantic soul.Lucia Racekovavisual merchandiser
5,My Valentine's Gift,I read one page of True Love at a friend's house. The story I read was so beautiful that I bought a copy right away just before Valentine's Day. It's a gift from me to me. It's a great book to own and to share.
4,I realize that I am old fashioned,"this book was a fast read, and many of the stories contained in it were truly beautiful. My favorite one was the college student who found love through DH Lawrence and the woman who helped him find it. The reason why I am only giving this 4 stars is my own old fashioned ideas. Many of the stories dealt with people who were married and ""fell in love"" with people other than their spouses, while being married."
3,the junk food version of love. R.F. still makes me laugh.,"True Love: Stories 1st edition by Fulghum, Robert published by Harpercollins HardcoverI am a huge fan of Robert Fulghum's short essay books, particularly his earliest works, as they make me laugh and have been good medicine. This book is not, strictly speaking, his writing, it is a compilation of stories told to him or written by others to him (selected by him) and so has a somewhat different flavor. The stories run the gamut, anonymously and some barefaced, of persons intimate stories of love, love lost or love wished, making them endearing and sometimes creepy depending on the story and your point of view. Fulghum acknowledges this potential creep factor about three quarters of the way into the book.I would describe this book as snack food even in its category. quick and easy but not terribly filling or satiating. Maybe not so healthy. a couple of the stories are VINTAGE Fulghum. He still makes me laugh."
4,How Romantic,This book was so mushy and romantic. I really enjoyed reading other peoples stories on true love and romance. Fulghum also adds his own little tid bits in that make it all the more enjoyable. I was fun to read one or two stories right before bed. Quick read.
4,massive storage,"this is an awsome drive. even though its only 5,400 rpm it has massive storage.this drive is pretty easy to install, espescialy if you already have a WD hard drive. if you don't it can get a little tricky but otherwise its pretty easy I give it a 4"
3,Good but you pay too much for the name,"This omlette pan is handy and well constructed. It has a solid, heavy base which heats evenly, it has a good quality non stick surface and a low conductivity handle (won't burn you hand if you leave it on the stove too long).However, the Calaphon pan costs double what the equivalent Cuisinart pan costs for a virtually identical product.Overall, this is a nice piece of cookware but overpriced."
3,Not up to All Clad quality but......,"I picked this up as a standby pan. It carries a good weight with it, and the handle is solid (have yet to see how the rivets hold up). After cooking some scrambled eggs on it, it seems the heat is distributed quite well (I watched the eggs begin to bubble, and they did so across the base of the pan at the same time). At the prices [online store] has them at, they make a nice starter set. Once your prepared, get yourself some All Clads. Good deal overall. These are made in China."
3,Eeeh could be better.,It is not good considering the fact that it is Mariah Carey;'s CD. People went crazy over this CED. It sounds like any other artists' album nowadays. I just had really high expectation.
1,An Exhaustive Atheistic View,"The one star was given for the books cover, and the paper inside for starting a fire. It was very easy to see, this author had not gone beyond his own conception as to the existence of God. After seeing this authors lack of research in writing this book, I will stay clear of all further books by this author."
3,For Current T Rex Fans Only....,"A little thin on Rex's best years during ""Electric Warrior"" & ""The Slider"" era, plus no live material. The best place for a new fan is the ""20th Century Boy"" compilation. Even die hard T Rex fans will have a difficult time listening to disc one more than once. The redeeming and condemning factor here is this set literally covers the bands entire existence. Previous sets rarely included any of the Warner/Reprise material released prior to ""The Slider"".The sound is suberb, even though some of the earlier material is just above demo quality.All in all (great cliche here) this set is a necessity for any long time Rex fan, but for newcomers start with ""Electric Warrior"" or the best of disc mentioned above. This is a little to pricey for anyone except a die-hard T Rex fan."
5,Great purchase experience,"I received the CD sooner than expected, and it was in the condition the seller said it would be. I am very happy with my purchase experience."
5,Perfection.,"I always been a huge fan of a circle of dead children's music and ""starving the vultures"" introduce me to their amazing and the most intense piece of grind...I've ever heard. I know that in today's scene, we see alot of dissapoiting acts but aslong as we still got bands like codc around? It makes everything worth-while. The best song? ""sunday's agenda"" thats my personal favorite track! If you still haven't bought codc's ""starving the vultures"" as well as their other albums? Go buy it now!!!"
2,Nothing special about this fork,"brush aluminum feel uncomfortable, small in size, not what I was looking for. Probably donate to Good Will."
5,Are you on drugs?,"I have seen this video, and it's nowhere near what the previous reviewer says it is.It is relaxing and pleasant-- the point is to soothe children, not wind them up like they're on speed. The quality of both audio and video is very fine, and not at all lacking like the previous person seems to think.I have seen children from 1 to 10 years old enjoy this video-- the slower pace is very enjoyable to them. My friend's fussy baby routinely falls asleep watching this, and for that, my friend is endlessly grateful.I have given this video to friends as presents, and all of them have thanked me profusely for it after watching it. Some have even gone on to buy the producer's other video about plants and love that one too."
1,It is SO boring!,"This is a way over priced ""home video."" And it is so boring it's pathetic. The quality is bad, and its ""new age,"" spacey music will put you or your child to sleep (if you can stay around long enough to watch it). Someone should tell whoever made this that videos for kids should be more dynamic and have better, more melodious music. We have other, wonderfully made videos about animals, and I just wished I didn't waste my money on this one!"
4,"very good, very worth it!","i read this book about two years ago as soon as it came out. I loved shular's two previous books and although this one wasn't quite as fantastic as they were, this one is still a must read. As with shuler's other books you'll feel connected to Antelope and the other characters and when reading feel like your back in pre-columbian america living right beside them. Linda Lay Shuler is an exceptional author and I sincerely hope she continues to write on this subject! I start college in the fall majoring in archaeology. With due credit given to author Sue Harrison whose books introduced me to the field of native american archaeolgy, Shular's books have steered me to a hopeful career in southwest archaeology."
3,Overall a good read,"Out of the three books, I have to admit I enjoyed Voice of the Eagle, the 2nd one, the best. I found that Antelope's character was softened quite a bit and she turned into Kwani. Perhaps this was done purposely to show an evolution of the character. I also found that Ms. Shuler tends to repeat her phrasing for her imagery over and over throughout the trilogy. Much of it becomes predictable and tired. The final ending seemed to be rushed and it becomes quite clear that the author was not going to continue the story line. Nonetheless, I think I would have preferred a little less ""tragedy"" in Antelope's life and perhaps a bit more focus on the outcome of her final goal - to return home.All in all, I enjoyed the trilogy and recommend it to others. I found it rekindled some aspects of my spirituality that had been neglected. Perhaps better attention to some details in terms of characterization and editing would have improved the trilogy."
5,Read Aloud,"My husband and I love books like this to read to each other, books that include romance, adventure, suspense and overcoming adversity."
3,Let the Drum Speak,"I truly enjoyed this book, but the characters somewhat spoiled it for me. It seemed like Shuler made Antelope and Chomoc into their parents. It seemed as though I was reading about Kwani and Kokopelli rather than the Antelope and Chomoc I remembered from Voice of the Eagle."
4,unread but worthy of high marks,"I rate this book very highly,have not read it yet, I have read this lady's other two books and they were excellent. Was so glad to find this one on site--looked in some used book stores with no luck./ No surprise, I will not give her books up either, will also be careful. who I loan them to."
4,Let the Drum Speak,I bought this for my son and he liked it. Linda is a very good author. If you like the other books you will like this one according to my son.
4,The Ventures All-Time Greatest Hits,"4 Stars only because the hit mix of ""Walk Don't Run"" - clean as it is - is not really STEREO. It COULD have been because EMI has the catalog of all these old Liberty and Dolton Records releases. In fact, EMI did put the stereo original of ""Walk Don't Run"" on its ""24 Greatest Hits of All Time"" CD released back in 1991.That said, the STEREO and recordings are GREAT on ALL these other Ventures original tracks that made the national charts. Worth the purchase, and the purchase price, if you can forgive the otherwise just-short-of-perfect version of ""Walk Don't Run."""
1,No tee,"No tee was given as promised, they have since changed the title to show no tee. Also the football does not seem to be the greatest quality"
4,The best artist you never heard of,"By now Fiends and Angels and Escape from Babylon have been reissued on Wounded Bird records, along with American Heartbeat and Matinee Weepers. This compilation has stuff from all but American Heartbeat because the masters were missing when it was produced. My advice is to buy them all but if you are too cautious buy this one. Four stars just because American Heartbeat is my favorite."
3,Paying for the name?,"Caphalon cookware is considered among the best, and this is a great pan. I do think, however, that there are others just as nice but half the price. My main contention with this pan is weight-- Caphalon cookware is *heavy*! While this is a nice pan to have, there are others that are just as good, easier to handle, and cheaper."
2,"Without the pictures, this would be a brochure.","Although there is some useful information for someone wanting to break into the field of voice over work, Sandy Thomas, for the most part, just skims the surface. The never-ending typos and sentence fragments are also very distracting. The ""Exhibits and References"" section in the back can be useful, but still does not justify the book's pricetag."
5,Great Product,Product arrived in a timely manner. These grits are hard to find in my area. They are much better than the quick grits found in grocery stores.
3,Error over the ethnicity of the state of Nanzhao,"I've only casually browsed through this book after receving it a few days ago. Yet an obvious error came up. Mr Cohen repeatedly used the phrase ""the Thais of Nanchao (Nanzhao)"". It appears that he was unaware that the identification of the medieval semi-Sinicized kingdom of Nanzhao in Yunnan with the ethnic Thais have been already disproved for several decades. The people of Nanzhao were a mixed group, with the ruling class being mainly of the Bai ethnicity. The Bai people speak a Tibeto-Burman language, not a Daic language. I hope that as I read on, there will be no further errors of this kind. I suppose Mr Cohen is more of an expert on modern history."
5,Great!,"This was the first book I've read of Christina Skye's. I loved it. It had humour along with sizzling romance, intrigue, and family. It left you with a smile and a feeling of happiness. There's so few Authors that write with humour, other than Garwood, that I was delighted to finally find another Author that does. I read a lot of books, but few make you laugh and still fewer leave you with a good feeling deep inside. This book did it for me."
3,"Good read, but left me wanting more...","The overall concept was fun & sexy, but I just kept reading, hoping to find that ""spark"" that all good books leave you with. I just didn't find that spark. There was waaaaay too much attention to the details of the physical therapy aspect, and I found little interest in the fruity concoctions for facials. Since I'm not much of a quitter, I read the entire book (still waiting for that ""spark"") but it left me wanting ... more.... Maybe I just wasn't the reader CS targeted for such a book."
2,"If Your A Fan of Christina Skye, get this from the library",". . . and if you're not, don't bother reading it at all. The story was boring, the chemistry was lacking, and the entire premise totally unbelievable. I've read other books by Ms. Skye and bought this book. Reading should be fun but it was actually work to finish this book."
4,A woman who can have it all -Her Way,"I thouroughly enjoyed reading this book about a woman running a spa/resort that I would LOVE to visit, along with falling madley in love with a Navy Seal. This book is not like all the other memory loss sappy love stories that are all over the book shelves. It has great twist, turns and really draws you in to the plot and characters. Can't wait for the story about her living on the edge writer sister, Taylor."
2,Good and bad feelings on this,Product came already opened and I tried to contact vendor but never got any reply. Exp was not accurate either - was not 14 months left as stated. Shipping was timely though.
3,Good. Not Great,Hoped for good things with this. Reasonable layout. Some good hints and tips. Good section on preparation.However...Photos in the book aren't that great. Also it is a little dated.
1,Load of rubbish,"This book is an absolute waste of money. I bought this because I enjoyed her other book ""Travel Photography"" which is quite good but this book is probably the worst I have bought.The information is out of date and wrong in quite a few sections. Worst of all the photography is probably the worst I have seen and is printed very poorly. Based on this I dont know how she got where she is. Money spent better elsewhere."
5,Awesome,"I love this pan. It's very large and deep. I've only used it about 10 times, but, it has been great."
5,"Great pan, worth the money.",This is an amazing pan. We struggled with spending the money but have found the pan to be worth it.
2,Look for alternatives!,"When shopping for cookware, you really should look out for:1) materials -- what's the pan made of? What's the durability of the surface? Calphalon only rates so-so for me here. It's fairly thick aluminum, but these pans DO warp over time.2) pan shape -- I use the ""pouring"" test, which is all about how the pan lip is designed. Calphalon fails big for me here.3) pan manipulability -- I really don't like the new swoopy Calphalon handles. They're smooth and curvy and narrow, making it very hard to control the pan when lifting or partially lifting it off the fire.There are plenty of good cookware manufacturers out there. My money definitely goes elsewhere after some considerable experience with a large set of Calphalon."
2,Not good for smooth surface cooktops,"I splurged on this pan because I was tired of the ""wobble"" my cheaper pans developed on my smooth glass cooktop. This pan warped severely after only 4 months, not any better than pans a fraction of the cost. I plan on returning it for replacement, and will use the new one for low temperature sauces only."
4,great cookware; poor handle,"the nonstick surface is great and I like the size & depth of the pan.the handle though is designed poorly--it is too thin and narrow to provide a good grip, so the pan tends to flip over when one grips the handle, rendering the handle rather useless."
2,What in the world?,"Can anyone tell me what ""The Last Lovers on Earth"" intends to say? It touts itself as a film that ""finally dares to tell the truth."" Well, that long-awaited truth still eludes me.Is it that gay leaders have done a terrible disservice to gays by acting like clowns? Can you avoid AIDS by not participating in AIDS protests? Is the scientific community out to kill every last gay?I'm probably suffering from a lack of information here. Knowing how political the AIDS epidemic became--and remains--I may not know enough of the background to understand the film's self-proclaimed ""humor and satire.""""The Last Lovers on Earth"" presents itself as iconoclastic. But like so many things with iconoclastic intent, it manages only to be recondite, at least for me.I guess I'm one writer who doesn't get this particular ""writer's film."""
2,The Skin of a Foundation,"I ordered this book with the hopes of gaining insight through examples and unrealized concepts. Unfortunately this book skimmed the surface of leverage. It discussed several types of leverage each which contained a few examples and commentary followed by questions to develop your untapped leverage opportunities. The concepts were good, the examples were few and brief and the questions were too brief and vague to procure a hint of enlightenment or anything in the same neighborhood.Summary: Wealthy people are using leverage. There are several types. Find the type that best suits you and read a lot about it to develop a solid foundation before continuing on. Visit my website and tell your friends about my book :)I also find it strange that several other reviewers who gave 5 stars are from the same state/area as the author."
2,Catchy title - but falls short in content,"A book that drew me in by the title and the premise, but offered little more than BASIC (think ""Leverage for Dummies"") teaching. For example - here are the three ""keys"" of leverage: people (hire other people to do your work), money (use other people's money) and time. He doesn't little beyond this to offer any kind of innovation around how to do this.There, that's pretty much it. Now you don't need to by the book."
1,Not worth it,"I've worked in semiconductors 20 years and bought this to fill out my collection of processing books, along with a sci-fi book by the same author. The sci-fi book was much better from the standpoint that I didn't lose a full $125, its primary redeming quality. Most of what is in here is elementary and dated and shows only an academic understanding of the topic. You can get more relevant insights on real processing from wikipedia. Save money, buy mine used... please!!"
4,Very nice and exactly what I was looking for.,Have had it about 2 weeks now and it works great. Just what I wanted. Only downside is the cap isn't attached so can be lost easily.
4,Good quality,This was a Christmas present and has been used a lot for many years. Good solid quality and good cooking results. I have been very pleased with this set and would recommend it.
4,The best money can buy,You can't go wrong with these pots! Gets hot quick and evenly. If you're going to buy pots and pans... These are it! Accept no other! I've bought other pots and pans over the years and they never last me more than 2 years. I've had these for five and they still perform like new! The only thing I don't like is the handle gets hot and requires protection when handling.
2,uncomfortable to carry,"Its good for a long walk and my dog likes it, but its quite uncomfortable to carry, the product comes with a cord type but its very thing and not strong, so it hurts on the shoulder, also come with a clip so you can attach it to your pants or clothes but its no good as well."
2,Spendy & cheaply made,After receiving this product..I was satisfied and thought ok I got what I paid for. Then I saw other similar products at Petco & Marshalls of all places that was cheaper and better quality. Dont spend more than $8 bucks for this! you can get a better quality product for less!
4,Pet Water Bottle & container,This container works very well for our needs. I use it regularly during the hot days of Summer & my dog is very happy to have water when he needs it. No more looking for water when he is panting & thirsty. It is simple & easy to use. Spoil your dog & feel good about using it!
5,Great for hot summers.,This is perfect travel water dish. Large size is great and holds a good amt of water.
3,Dragon Dynasty,"I look forward to all the DVDs from Dragon Dynasty, but this release was a let down to me. The action was a little on te dull side. The story was okay, but nothing to write home about."
2,Not effective in stretch/dorsiflexion,"I bought this for a friend with plantar fasciitis. The product did not cause much upward pull on the toe area, so there is little or no dorsiflexion or ""stretch"" along the bottom of the foot. I tried to connect the straps higher on my friend's leg to get more upward pull, but the product didn't allow that.As it is, the straps tend to pull on a line along the foot, not from above it. Have a close look at the photo to see what I mean. The product is soft and comfortable and could keep the foot at a 90-degree angle; that is, it could keep the foot from dropping down."
2,check the track lengths before you buy.,"This so-called ""album"" contains just 26 minutes of music.Thanks, Amazon. Next time I'll be more careful."
3,It's not bad or anything...,"...But for the same price, you can buy pure sesame oil (or grapeseed oil which has a lighter scent) at many grocery stores and avoid ANY additives, whether they are harmful or not. Occasionally I'll impulse-buy this and end up using it because it works fine, I just try to avoid unnecessary fragrance and parabens. It also works exactly the same as any pure oil and does not dry or absorb any better.It has a nice, very light scent and moisturizes well but does not absorb all the way. Applying a small amount, it has not ruined my clothes or anything, but it does leave smudges on anything I touch unless I wipe it with a towel after applying."
5,great oil,works really well and smells awesome too! A staple in my medicine cabinet all year round. Just remember to work into skin well before putting on clothes.
4,The Neutrogena Body Oil is a fun and ...,"The Neutrogena Body Oil is a fun and silky body oil. After getting out of the shower and using the oil, I was left with a light smooth feel on my skin. It's not very greasy, despite its name. I enjoyed the way the body oil made my skin feel, and the smell wasn't unpleasant. I really like this product, even though it's a bit pricey."
3,Victor Malloy - Lions And Tigers And Bears,"Victor Malloy's second album, LIONS AND TIGERS AND BEARS, is a complete departure from their first. Where as THE MUSINGS OF MONSIEUR MALLOY was all cinematic trip-hop, this album is indie rock mixed with folktronica whimsy. And while the vocals harmonies in ""The Girl in the Hood"" make this bearable, the electronics that appear in ""Tallyvan Army"" seem ill-fitting. The delicate strings and horns that kick off ""Different Time"" bring us back to trip-hop territory, however -- reminiscent of Dust. But ""A Night in Vegas"" is weirdly peppy, like it's begging for crossover status, and the jangling rock that kicks off ""Radio Municipal"" almost puts you off the actual song, a melancholy instrumental. ""Is No One Grateful Here"" has some post-rock buzz going for it, and ""We Could've Been Anything"" is certainly twee. But overall, this is an odd, schizophrenic album that unfortunately doesn't quite get its act together."
1,"Nice idea, doesn't work","I have the terrible habit of pointing my feet forward when I sleep and then my plantar fasciitis flares up - numb, tingling feeling in both heels. So I was hopeful this ""Soft Night Splint"" would be the perfect thing to wear while sleeping.The problem is, it doesn't work. Unless you are as weak as a butterfly, it's still very easy to point your feet forward after wearing the splints because the straps aren't rigid. That defeats the entire purpose.The splint doesn't breathe and is also very hot with or without wearing socks. The base of the straps are too close to your toes so when you start to point your toes, the straps crush your toes and they become numb after a while.A soft splint is a nice idea but this one simply doesn't work. Try a rigid splint."
3,Good Sample of Plotinus,"The Essential Plotinus: Representative Treatises from the Enneads by Elmer O'Brien provides a short selection of Plotinus' more important writings. Though not widely read today Plotinus had a tremendous influence on ancient and medieval thought. Rather esoteric and oblique from a twentieth-first standpoint, his work remains relevant for students of philosophy and theology. In particular, Plotinus' view of the One's (God) transcendence and his thoughts regarding the limitations of intellectual analysis and reason are helpful.I would recommend the book as an entry point for someone seeking an introduction to Plotinus. This is not, however, a good starting point for someone who is new to the field of philosophy. From my perspective, as others have noted, O'Brien's translation is quite readable (about as readable as Plotinus gets anyways). A potential drawback is the limited analysis and context provided by the author."
2,Different opinion....,"First, I should say that I love Susan Sizemore's vampire romance series (I Thirst for You, I Burn for You, I Hunger for You). I re-read those books often and am looking forward very much to the next book in that series.So I bought Scandalous Miranda shortly after it came out, assuming I would enjoy it. I'm sorry to say that I found the plot predictable and the characters unconvincing. I figured out almost immediately who Dante was going to turn out to be, and could muster so little interest in the rest of the plot that I ended up just skimming the last half of the book to see how the author developed the romance, but I also found that uninteresting, probably because I never came to care about the characters."
2,No real plot or interesting characters,"The plot was like a spider spinning it's web that never really led anywhere. I found it slow, boring and predictable. I kept hoping that it would pick up and become more 'Something' but it never did. The Characters including Miranda and Andrew/Dante, all were without depth & without the charisma to draw them to the reader."
2,Well...,"You know, it is what it is...cheap vinyl, kinda not built to last...but if you love Nintendo, well..."
5,Great wallet,"High quality, with plenty of spots to put everything, I had one for about 2 years before it was worn to the point I decided to get a new one. Now I am all set for probobly another 2 years, and I hope they still make these when its time for a new one again!"
3,Nu Metal and beyond,"The most exiting debut album I have heard since Definitely Maybe. The first 6 tracks are in the nu-metal vein with pounding rhythms and walls of guitars coming at you like a great tidal wave, sweeping all emotions in front of it. Yet, the use of melody and softer passages lifts this way above your average heavy metal. Later tracks have the angsty feel of indie with vocals that snare you and pull you in. It plays well alongside The Foo Fighters, Red hot Chili Peppers, and Radiohead, which gives you some idea of the maturity and complexity of the work."
3,I've used Neutrogena products for a long time ...,"I've used Neutrogena products for a long time and I really like the brand. I would say this isn't a moisturizer that I'd buy. I have really dry hands and this product didn't do much to help make them feel softer. The lotion is very runny and took quite a while to absorb, even though their bottle says, """"absorbs quickly."""" I do like that it's fragrance-free and doesn't contain mineral oils, though. It might be all right for moderate to dry skin, but not strong enough for severely dry skin."
4,Good music,"I first heard this when I had it as a tape. I used to listen to it as a kid. The people who gave it low ratings are just stuck up and nothing is good enough for them, the music is good. All the singers and musicians are Irish singers and musicians, so their accents can hardly be ""faked"". Buy it, it's cheap and if its not good enough for you, just remember it's music. And yes the quality isn't amazing because it's old. Overall I enjoyed it for years."
3,Comment on Immersionplus French Complete,"There are several language audio CD's on the market that are really fabulous for the beginnner but I had not yet seen one really good language audio CD course for either intermediate or advanced users. The ""Immersionplus French Complete"" may be the exception in this case. Even though the audio CD's in this course do not contain any interactive features, these are still among the best French language audio CD's available for those particular users. Each one of the interesting stories in the audio CD's is spoken by native speakers three times. The stories are spoken first at a normal pace, the second time at a slower pace, and again a third time at a normal pace. With this novel approach, Penton Overseas has done a really fantastic job of enriching one's listening, understanding and conversatonal skills of the French language."
2,"Recorder OK, but customer service stinks!",It does the typical DVD-R features. Called Customer Service twice for help with a recording error. They gave me incorrect information both times and said that I'd have to live with it. The second time I asked to speak with a supervisor waited 20 minutes then gave up!
1,Don't buy this unit.,Save yourself some money and buy something more expensive than this unit. I thought when I bought this that they could not screw up a dvd recorder..but they did.-Restricted to dvd+r/+rw media-Programs on a 24 hour clock not am/pm-Loses programmed channels and skips over some standard 2-13 channelswhen programming-Need to reprogram the time almost daily because of a slow internal clock
2,"Adequate recorder, no customer support","After wrecking about five dvds I finally got the thing to work. The menu sometimes freezes, won't switch off or eject the disk. If you use compatible DVDs it will sometimes perform up the level of brand name products. Two stars for closing the customer service office, going bankrupt and ignoring BBB complaints about this manufacturer."
4,A Special Note to Oboe Lovers!,"To anyone who loves the oboe, this CD is worth buying if only for John de Lancie's famous rendition of the Marcello Concerto (the whole concerto is here), which is the best I have ever heard. His interpretation of the soaring slow movement is especially beautiful. The sound is very clear and the other selections (including a delightful version of Vivaldi's ""Spring"" concerto with flute instead of violin) are quite good, with perhaps a little too much emphasis on the pompous... But never mind all that: if you like the oboe as much as I do, this is probably one of the best available examples of de Lancie's wonderful sound and definitely worth the price of the whole CD!"
2,OK but overpriced,"This book provides the reader with an overview of Italy following the travels of an American student. The level is appropriate for someone with one semester of collge Italian. While the book does an acceptable job, the price is way out of line. The material in the book is also out of date in a number of instances."
3,Not an easy read,"I rented this book from the library and it was not an easy read and a lot of ""talking""to get to the subject. I like 7 steps to bonding with your step child much better."
5,Keys to Successful Stepfathering,"This is a great book for any soon to be stepfather. I highly recommend it to anybody that wants to gain more insight on what possible situations that a stepfather & mother may run into. Life is complex enough, so it never hurts to read up on subjects that can affect your life drastically!!"
2,Has so much potential but could be better...,"This stroller ""could"" be great. Here are the negs:I have come to realize I hate the handles (doesn't work for single handed steering), canopy is eh - doesn't shade much at all BUT these two issues aren't deal breakers this IS a $29.00 stroller not a bugaboo. What IS the deal breaker is that as other reviewers have stated this seat is WAY TOO NARROW and not deep enough. Let me make sure you all know exactly how narrow this seat it...My son was a PREEMIE. He's skinny as can be and very very narrow and he is STUFFED into this seat. Well not anymore, I'm getting rid of it. It worked for us for about a month. Yes the wheels are very good but not if my son can't ride in it (my handbag can't even ride in it, it's too shallow). Looks hot (for an umbrella stroller) and sounds good but don't fall for it's sexy style - this is a complete waste."
4,Great umbrella stroller,"This is a great little umbrella stroller.Pros:*removable and adjustable canopy hood*great colors - mine is black w/red detail (I got it from Toys R Us, Babies R Us just has black w/yellow detail*great storage saddle bags*steers great w/ easy manueverability*handles are taller than most umbrella strollers*handles are covers in foam so they are more comfortableCons:*the old umbrella stroller that was navy and yellow reclined, wish this one did too*the seat needs to be a little bit bigger"
4,Quick and Easy,"After driving around searching for a smaller stoller I've finally found one that was compact and plenty of storage and was affordable. Our son just turned 1 this month, we needed something that was smaller and lightweight. Although, he was fine in the travel system stroller we had, we didn't have enough room in our truck for this huge stroller and throwing it in the back of the truck was just a horrible experience. Going out to go buy another lightweight stroller for more money and just ended up at another store to just see what they had and found this one! Great Price and very lightweight. One thing I wish it had was a travel bag to put the stroller in."
3,It's ok.....,"We bought this stroller a few months ago. It's a decent umbrella stroller, but I kinda wish we'd spent just a bit more and bought one that had at least a small basket on the bottom. Plus I wish we'd had more time try out a few more models to see how it was to push them. We tend to walk on the side of this one while pushing it because otherwise we'd walk into the wheels. I do like how light it is though. And it doesn't take up much space in the trunk when folded."
1,Huge waste of money,"I was thrilled when I found this stroller on-line, however I was very disappointed when I received it. I wanted something lightweight and easier. It is. However, my one-year-old son doesn't fit! The stroller is too narrow for him and also not deep enough for him. His shoulders are squished together and he looks so uncomfortable in it. It also looks like he's going to slide off of the way too shallow seat! Unless you have a VERY TINY child, I would not recommend this stroller at all."
2,Like it BUT returned it,I brought the stroller and after putting in together i have to return it. it was too small for my 12-month old daughter... there was no room to put her arms... they need to make it wider!! I do like it but too bad i had to return it... just to narrow...
2,"Looks Cool, but . . .","I agree with the review above that this stroller is not ideal for small infants as it only has the lap belt and sits pretty erect. Our main complaint, though, is that by the time our son was 11 months old, he was able to apply enough presure to the rubber footrest to break it. Now that he's 20 months old and that footrest is long gone, he can simply drop his feet to the floor and walk in his stroller! I'll be standing at a cash register somewhere and I turn around and he's gone--he's walked himself right around the corner! I expected Jeep to be more rugged. Don't spend the extra money for Jeep. Just get a good, basic umbrella stroller for travelling."
4,light stroller,"The stroller is light and my baby boy loves to use it. However, they should redesign the seat holder as the space for the baby is too small and the seat belt hurt his legs."
4,Excellent lightweight stroller!,"This is an excellent light-weight stroller. It doesn't have much storage on the sides, but you can hang your diaper bag easily over the handles. I have a very large 8 month old and have used this stroller exclusively for the last 4 months. It folds very compactly and is very light - I carry my son in one arm and this in the other hand. The only feature that I feel could be better is the sun shade, it is a little small and awkard but that is my only complaint.My husband and I are both tall and have no problems with the size of this stroller."
2,"Looks great, but doesn't meet expectations","This seemed a sturdy stroller for the price, and I liked some of the features like the little saddlebags and the roll-up backrest. However, within only a month of very rare use, the footrest (the rubber sling part) broke- and my child didn't even stand on it or anything like that. Also, the sun-hood is very flimsy and needs constantly to be fiddled with when folding the stroller. I plan to purchase an Inglesina Swift, which at $89 has all the features of a Maclaren and the durability I expect when purchasing any juvenile product."
3,So far pretty good!,"I have just completed Hour 12. It has taken me many more hours than that!I have found this a very difficult book to study. All but one of the exercises have worked.....five BIG stars for that. The difficulty is that a lot of the language is in a type of double negative which is confusing. I have made corrections to my text on almost every page. Once through that, the content is good.I like the way Ben gives you less information in the later""To Do's"". That makes you remember or go back!If it is good, why only 3 stars? ....... <1>It has taken too long. <2>Ben needed a better editor. <3>I would have liked more help with the dreaded ODBC error 22005 in Hour 12 - still have not got it to work after 4 hours of research. <4>On line help woul be good SAMS!"
5,This book is a champ!,"I picked up the book over a weekend & was coding on a project the following Monday. My background is in Java application server development & CGI, so web programming isn't new to me. However, I believe this would be a great jumpstart for beginners & more advanced developers alike.The book is a good tutorial & a lightweight reference. Download the cold fusion server documentation for a more complete reference set ....My only complaint is about installing Cold Fusion Express - it doesn't seem to recognize iPlanet or Apache webservers without a bunch of tinkering (I never got it to work) - so you may just want to stick with MS IIS for this version. Cold Fusion 5 is available for evaluation & works great with iPlanet. I would recommend the later if you are just using it as a single developer in a development environment."

1,unuseable,"I don't know how anyone could use this CD, the bowls are struck with such a sharp strike that the sound is very jarring, impossible to relax to (even with the volume as low as possible and still hear both channels).. very poorly done. Unuseable to me."
2,Not a great book,"I purchased this book for my 4 year old niece for upcoming wedding and the 10 Cool things about being a ring bearer for my fiance's 8 year old nephew and was disappointed with both books. The text is virtually identical in both books (which wouldn't be a problem since they are going to two different homes) but the text isn't very compelling and is much too specific. I heard multiple comments of ""we aren't doing that,"" ""you're my aunt, not my sister"" etc. She enjoyed another book I also bought which told the STORY of a young flower girl -- and she could relate to ""she's just like me"" instead of the confusing first person narration of this book. It DOES make a difference to a child if the narration is first or third person since they often view characters in stories as friends."
3,10 Neat Things About Being a Flower Girl,"Was a little disappointed with this book selection. Bought as a little gift for my flower girls and although they were 7,5 and 3, it was really only meant for the 3-yr-old. Nice illustrations...just didn't care for the list of 10 things!"
3,OK by itself...,"...but don't buy this book AND 10 Cool Things about Being a Ring Bearer. It is the exact same book, same wording, etc., with only a few gender changes here and there. That wouldn't have been a problem except that my ring bearer and flower girl are siblings in the same household. Now I feel silly giving them identical books.As for this book on its own merits, there is no story to it. I thought it only ""sort of"" explained the flower girl's role and didn't really make it sound fun."
1,Very disappointed!,"The cute title lured me in to buying this book although the price was much higher than the other flower girl books listed on amazon.com. The only other thing I liked about this book was the introductory page. There is a place to write the date of the wedding, bride & groom's name along with the flower girl's name. From that point on the book was a pure disappointment. I had ordered 4 different books on being a flower girl and this one ranks at the bottom of my list! It lacks a good explanation of the role of a flower girl, has no story line, and will not keep my 4.5 year old granddaughter's interest for one minute. I tend to think that if something cost more it will be better...not in this case! Here is a perfect book on being a flower girl with a fun story and explanation on what happens before, during and afer a wedding. If you are looking for a book to help your little flower girl understand her role buy this:The Little Flower Girl (Pictureback(R))"
4,YUMMY!,"These smell so good and tasted just like ""regular"". Only wish they were vegetarian. Can't find any vegetarian ones that can even come close to these, so I'll settle for Kosher for now!"
5,Yum Yum,"These have got to be the best kosher marshmallows I have tasted. Not only are they delicious, but they have a wonderful texture. They are good no matter if you eat melt them or just eat them straight from the bag!"
2,Matter is an A+; manner D-,"This might very well be *most* poorly edited book I've ever purchased. Miss Walton's novels are wonderful, in every sense of that word; they rate 5 stars. The volume, though, merits no stars at all, thus my average of 2 stars. The book is utterly laden with distracting and misleading errors of all sorts. Words that make no sense in context substituted for what I know (having read the much better Ballantine paperback editions, years ago, and simply knowing the tales) should be there; whole passages repeated out of sequence. And I'm only some 50 pages into it! Overlook needs to fire whoever purported to edit this thing, and apologize to its customers...and to the memory of Evangeline Walton."
5,Beautiful,"An amazing fantasy book crafted with love. Prose as beautiful as Tolkien, and a true knowledge of the human heart."
2,not so good,"I inherited these pots & pans from my grandmother, and I felt so blessed to receive them. The problem is, if you use non-stick spray on these, then you burn something in it, it leaves a residue that doesnt go away. After that, you're stuck with a burn mark that releases chemicals into your food. I would go with regular stainless steel before purchasing this product, which I ended up investing in. Although these are ""hard anodized"", you never know what might be relased into your food. Especially when the experts find new things all the time about what is safe to cook with."
2,Surface wears out.,"I bought this set expecting it to last a long long time. I must admit that I was a little wary about buying aluminum cookware after links to Alzheimer's disease being publicised in medical journals, but was reassured by the non reactive claim for the hard anodized surface. My mistake.After only 4 years the surface of most of my cookware is badly pitted. The saucepans are showing the silver aluminum layer underneath. So much for the non-reactive surface claim.And no- I haven't put this in the dishwaser - just cleaned it per the instructions.I'm junking this set and getting one with a true non reactive stainless steel cooking surface.A real waste of money. My old cheapy T-Fal non-stick lasted just as long."
2,"OK to dance to, not a listening pleasure","The first time I heard a bilingual/Spanglish remix of ""Suavemente,"" I was dancing in a favorite club and was delighted by the novelty. After my boyfriend bought the Remixes CD, however, I found that many of my favorite songs suffered in the translation. The charm of ""Suavemente,"" for example, is totally lost as the best lines of the song disappear into a mix of lesser new lyrics and harsh-sounding translations. Why translate the song if you're going to drop out a wonderful line such as, ""Dame un beso mas que en mi boca cabe""? (""Give me one kiss more than my mouth can hold"") [Pardon the lack of accents!] If you want the CD as dance music for a noisy party, it may provide novelty, but I can't recommend it for everyday listening. (_Suavemente_, however, I recommend highly!)"
1,Who did this?,"It's almost 2004 and these remixes are extremely outdated. Even at their release date, these remixes sounded awful. This is a very bad production and never deserved to be released. Just very unproffesional mixing even by known DJ's such as Eddie Arroyo and A.T. Molina. I could've done much better with my computer remixing software and a little cash. I checked it out from the library, which was a good thing because the music is ""unlistenable"", if such word exists."
1,Great idea with unreliable performance.,"I love the idea of this little motion alarm, but found the alarm function unreliable. It couldn't detect my motion, but would go off for unknown reasons. Later found out that it can often go off with breeze or flourescent lights.I really liked this item and wanted it to work for me, but after having replacement behave in the same manner, I had to give it a vote of ""no confidence"". I actually contacted the manufacturer of this product to help me trouble shoot. This company has an outstanding customer service department if ""Mike"" is typical. He was prompt, understanding and used easy-to-understand language while helping me trouble-shoot. Because of his service, I would try another product from this company without hesitation!"
2,Keeps beeping,"The product does beep when someone enters the door, but as you keep walking it keeps beeping. It needs to have some kind of delay to not beep more than once when one person walks in. Other than that it's ok."
5,A great soundtrack.,"This soundtrack captures much of the atmosphere of the Conan Doyle stories, and the Jeremy Brett/Edward Hardwicke TV series.The arrangements and performance are first class.The CD is worth obtaining for anyone with an interest in Sherlock Holmes.Brett's contribution as Sherlock Holmes is in a class of its own. Like this CD, it has no real competition - it is valuable and unique."
5,Pure Pleasure!,"The music on this CD is absolutely wonderful! Each track transports me back to a certain episode and the violins calm my world. I have watched Jeremy Brett's interpretation of Sherlock Holmes (I have the set of DVDs) over and over again and simply love him in the role, so being able to sit down, close my eyes and be drawn in again is most pleasant. I would recommend this CD to all who love the music from the show, sure that you'll love the clarity and sheer classiness of it!"
2,Not for the hard of hearing,"I have always enjoyed the Sherlock Holmes series, not just for the wonderful acting by Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke, but for the attention to detail in the costumes, sets, and music. I looked forward to having the soundtrack from the first series. Though the selections are from the series, the sound reproduction is very poor and in some cases the selection is very brief. You can't just turn up the volume because the selections are uneven in their volume and a soft piece may suddenly roll into a booming crescendo. An avid fan of music, Holmes would soon be on the trail of the sound technicians for their slaughter of some fine pieces."
1,Ascension,"I used the Unbox Video Player to download this and another movie to watch while I was going to be off the grid. When I started playback I got the picture but no audio. Since I was off the grid, little I could do to resolve the issues with Amazon. This was and is the last time I will pay good money for a movie to be viewed later via the Unbox Video Player."
2,Ehh...,"I found it hard to follow. I am a space nut, especially when it has to do with Saturn's moon, Titan, but I had a hard time following what was supposed to be going on. I did buy it though, so it'll get another chance somewhere down the road."
1,Boring and Tedious,"This script would have been better served as an ""Outer Limits"" episode. Than perhaps it would have had better pacing and appeal, as it is it was boring and even annoying in places. The opening scene, for example, would it have been so much for our protagonist to have a scene to introduce the main characters in the beginning rather than having it that he arrives at the space base with no greeting and and has to walk down a dark narrow hallway with a flickering fluorescent light to a dark shabby room alone. The film seemed to strive too hard for an ""noir"" feel, or perhaps it was trying to be deep. I would have recommended that the makers have watched Sean Connery in the movie ""Outland"" made in 1981 to get some idea of how to set up a tone."
2,Good movie with a poor ending,"Very entertaining movie with an incredibly poor ending. I felt like a reader of a book who finds the last five pages missing.Good acting, good story, well done considering the obviously modest budget but there is simply no getting around the incredibly poor (non)ending. Did they run out of film stock? If shot on video did they screw up and purchase a too short video cartridge when it came time to shoot the movie? Something went wrong that is for sure. The ending pretty much crapped on the rest of the movie. Could have been a true gem but those hopes got dashed with the premature rolling of the credits.Too bad and truly disappointing. Should throw in an expletive or two but it is too hot to get all worked up right now.I cannot recommend renting this movie or even watching the thing for free if and when Amazon offers it for ""free"" for Amazon Prime members. Whatever you do do NOT purchase this movie under any circumstance."
2,Not to bad,"The acting was good. Obviously low budget, but that will not distract from the story. The special effects were minimal and not really needed all that much. This movie was more of a suspenseful type.I found the story somewhat hard to follow (what is the significance of the star jewel?). The ending was abrupt, with no clear explanations.It's worth watching once (rent it) if you are a scifi fan."
2,OK Plot,"Overall a slow, yet cerebral movie. Probably wont watch again. For the cost of a rental its an evening for conversation after the film."
1,Full blown bullshit,"The most stupid movie of all times.Waist of time.Full blown bullshit.Do not watch it, not recommended.Idiotic movie."
2,It was ok,Wasnt what I thought it was. The ending was terrible in my opionion. I have an over active imagination and had more of a better idea. with the previews it made me think of the idea of living threw time and still remembering the first love and those that past but it was more about sybolism than really a point or a learning or really anything that had a great point of view. disappointing.
1,A real snooze.........,Like eating a turkey sandwich and washing it done with a big glass of milk..........naptime. I would have enjoyed the sandwich more than this movie.
5,Prosthetic use,"I use this under my liner for my prosthetic leg. It is easier to apply, doesn't make my skin break out, and my liner does not develop an odor and slides on easily. I highly recommend it for someone that has a prosthetic arm or leg."
3,Smooooooth.,"I love this product. Was a little sad that I didn't get the one with fragrance, but this was really nice."
5,Great Product,"This is a fanastic product. I have been using this for over ten years. I put it on my skin while it is still damp from the shower and it sinks in immediately. It helps moisturize my skin during the harsh winter months, my legs tend to get very dry, itchy, and flaky and this product helps relieve this. It does not leave an oily residue like other oil based products do. It has a very, very light scent which is fine then I can put on my perfume and not smell funny. I love this product and will keep using it as long as I can."
4,"Overall, I really like the Neutrogena Light Sesame ...","Overall, I really like the Neutrogena Light Sesame Body Oil. It goes on very smoothly and absorbs quickly. It doesn't leave an oily residue like some other body oils. And it has no fragrance, so it doesn't interfere with my cologne. The only problem with this product that I found is that the bottle tends to get rather messy and slippery. I will definitely use this body oil again."
5,I loved the body oil. It's very light ...,I loved the body oil. It's very light and keeps my skin moist. I'll be using this spray on a regular basis and have already recommended it to friends and co-workers.
1,Not a book on e-commerce as such,"Typical Microsoft Press....Not a book to buy if you want to learn about e-commerce strategies (!) If you are using MS e-commerce software, however...."
5,A Very Useful Study Aid,"This manual gives the solutions, with work, to the odd-numbered exercises in the first eleven chapters of James Stewart's Calculus: Early Transcendentals. It is both concise and sufficient, and can be a very useful tool for understanding the concepts taught by the exercises in each section. It is equally useful for helping you out on a problem when you get stuck. (Of course, these benefits will be curtailed if you have a teacher who compulsively assigns even-numbered exercises simply to annoy the students.) Also keep in mind that the manual covers only the first eleven chapters of Early Transcendentals, typically covered during the first two semesters of college calculus or a full year of AP Calculus BC at the high school level. With these caveats in mind, I consider this manual to be a valuable tool for any calculus student using Stewart's textbook."
5,Jaiya is Superb!,"Both this album and Firedance (their first one) are superb! Jaiya touches all the nerves, from sweet and soulful to rollicking and lively. There is really high quality musicanship here, and the recording and mastering is excellent (I am a sound engineer!) I really appreciate the earth-honoring themes in these songs - it's just what we need right now, when we have to stop devastating our earthly environment before it's too late. Thank you, Jaiya, for your inspiring and heart-warming music!"
2,"No hope in this pope (the movie, that is and a spoiler alert)","I wanted to love this movie; really I did, but, the ending was AWFUL. Just because one person decides he cannot do the job does not mean the end of the world, figuratively speaking. I kept thinking about what is said when English royalty dies-- ""the king (queen) is dead; long live the king (queen)."" The Church goes on regardless of any one person.This is one time when I really wish I had heeded the other reviews instead of going with my hopes that this movie would be all it could be. Sigh. I gave it two starts because there WERE some cute scenes and the trailer was good. All the sub-story lines just kind of wandered around into oblivion though and the ending was so depressing. I do not recommend this movie."
3,Dabitur vobis,"As a kid in Catholic high school about 50 years ago I was surprised to hear my most-admired priest say that he had been called upon to speak at a meeting where he hadn't expected it, in front of the bishop and other big wigs and he panicked. But he remembered Luke 6:38, ""Give and it shall be given unto you"", and decided to open his mouth and see what would come out. Cardinal Melville as the unwilling pope-elect could have done the same and made it a much better movie. It's just hard to believe that a professional church man could invest decades of service and then fumble when it counted most. I'm wondering, what is it? Has he been diagnosed with cancer which he is hiding or some other dark secret ... some explanation. To take my time and money and then not deliver any reason at all made this a very disappointing movie. On the other hand, it's a pretty movie, lots of grampas in red robes bobbing and weaving around the Vatican."
2,Thought it would be a comedy; it is not.,"Thought this was going to be a comedy and it is not. While it had some thought provoking moments, I would not recommend this movie."
1,Blah,"I was expecting a great comedy, full of surprises or at least a drama with all the decisions someone in that position need to face, but not one thing and not the other. I kept waiting for 1.5 hr for the movie to actually start, and get some complicated characters in the mix. Not such thing. Totally disappointing. Think a potentially great story-line was wasted."
1,Disappointing,"An alledge comedy about a serious topic depending on someone's religious affiliations.In my case it was about an elected Pope who turns out to be morally and emotionally weak.He is unable to fulfill an enormous responsibility bestowed on him by his colleagues.After viewing this movie,it left me in shock unable to fathom how a loser was even elected.A feel bad movie,I could not recommend it."
2,Starts well and then fades very badly,"After 22 minutes this film is perfectly poised: the cardinals have chosen an unknown to be the new Pope and as he is due to step out on the balcony of St Pauls to greet the adoring crowds, he decides he can't deal with the pressure. From this moment on the film loses its way very badly. The main challenge is that we know nothing about the new Pope and don't really care about him. The Vatican calls in a leading psychologist to examine the reluctant Pope-to-be and he decides to spice things up by arranging a volleyball tournament between the various cardinals. The director then decides he is Fellini and the film makes less and less sense as we progress tortuously towards the end. This was a big missed opportunity."
2,we have a pope,I was very disappointed in this dvd. I thought it would be much better than it was. It was not funny.
1,ALL YOU HAVE TO DO....,".... is look at Jimmy on the cover to know what TRASH this book is. Get a life, Jimmy!!!!!!"
3,Rising Interest,"I'm excited to meet this author and hopefully get my book signed at the Printer's Row. I find men to so entertaining, and I always wanted to hang with them when I was little. I never could talk my father/brother/grandfather into letting me follow them to the barbershop and even when I got my tattoo, I was in the back. I was crazy about the first ""Barbershop"" movie (the 2nd one was cool too) and when I saw this book, I couldn't get my hands on it fast enough. I loved reading the stories about the male barbers facing bad haircuts, capping, crime, discrimination, the younger generation, fatherhood, manners and women. There was even some eye candy: Marcques Tatum, Jabreel Ali, Kola Olosunde, and Lennie Bosley. The beginning stories were a little dry, but it picked up tremendously towards the middle."
5,enrique chia vol. 111,"absolutel beautiful piano music..i highly recommend this c.d. i have purchased nearly all of his piano c.d.'s..""BEAUTIFUL"""
1,"Interesting Plot, but Lacks Depth","Like the title says, this game has an interesting plot, but is severly lacks depth. All you do in the game is buy and repair weapons and attack others, thats it, quite literally nothing beyond that."
1,No No No No NO,"What a disappointment. A great premise, destroyed by terrible terrible graphics and poor game play. I love these sort of games but not this one. Now I understand why the price is below $30. New games should be closer to $50 if they are any good. Sorry; great idea but bad game. Looking forward to Civ 4."
1,disappointing,The dolphin sticker peels right off. Very disappointing and cheap looking. I bought this as a present for someone and it was actually quite embarrassing.
1,Image worse than composite cable,"This adapter didn't do the job for me. I was using it to connect a VCR without S-video to a T.V. with S-video. I tried the adapter on different connections and equipment but the image showed a sort of diamond pattern cross-hatching. In some ways the image was better but in some ways it was worse, and the worse dominated. It does have a lifetime warranty (limited to the price paid for the item) but after the cheapest return shipping method and cost of mailer, I'd only get about $1.50. At least it was cheap enough that it wasn't a big loss."
3,Works Alright,"This is a decent product, but certain video cards will not detect the display properly through this adapter. It will cause flickering but your video will not come up on the display. I'm assuming this model doesn't have true passive circuitry to prevent these types of problems. For older video cards that don't have to detect a display before using it, it works just fine."
5,Works as intended. Solid build.,I got this for my HP Touchsmart 300 desktop pc that has a built in tuner but only has s-video or coaxial connections. Most of the devices I'm connecting uses composite cables and this was exactly what I needed to get them to work.
2,"For the money I guess it's okay, but I wouldn't recommend it","I bought one of these to replace a Radio Shack video switch [cat. 15-1983] that I no longer needed except as an S-Video to composite converter. I thought this would be much easier than having the cables and the switcher between my computer and video modulator. Unfortunately, this item has much poorer video reproduction than even the cheap Radio Shack switcher. There was a noticeable drop in video clarity (picture was fuzzier) although the chrominance and luminance seemed about the same.So, for the money (under $4) it isn't terrible. However, I can't really recommend it as a good converter either. My suggestion ... spend more money and buy a better product."
2,Love the title,"I have to admit I bought this book mainly because of the title. My wife, a teacher, once had a student proclaim, ""Mrs. Hutchinson, you have a really big butt."" She has since lost 70 pounds. But married to a teacher and working in technology for the local school district I did have interest in reading the book. The author makes some good points but this is basically a rant against no child left behind."
1,BAD,we had to get work done to it and the pickups dont work very well on the e string. The fret board has sharp edges and the amplifier dosent sound very good.
3,It's ok,Well the color was wrong and only had one pick not two. I like it ok it sounds ok. Its good to use to learn.
5,Great product,"Arrived quickly, and we are very happy with the product. It was a gift for my son and he couldn't be happier. Thank you!"
5,Difficult BUT Awesome!,The title says it all! It was difficult I stitched this in my spare time but it took me a good solid 6-9 months to finish but when I did I got LOTS of wonderful comments on it! Make no mistake Teresa Wentzler makes some complicated patterns and this is one of those but if you have the patience then it will make a very rewarding completed project!
3,fun with an old gameboy advance,great if mom and dad are too cheap to buy a dvd player for the car gets you a little more use out of your old gameboy advance
5,Sennheiser E840 Vocal Microphone,This is an excellent sounding microphone and with its extended frequency range is well-suited to both female and male voices. An enthusiastic two thumbs up!
5,Nice sounding mic,"Very natural, even response, very sturdy construction and a ten-year warranty. Compared to an SM58 might be a little thinner in the mids but is less bassy and seems to be less susceptible to feedback on a small stage with less than optimal conditions."
4,A Peace of Mind,This book brought my mom a peace of mind when she reads it. A little laughter goes a long way.
3,"Interesting, but not a keeper","If you are looking for Stack-n-Whack, this book contains only a couple of examples - the rest of the quilts are 8-pointed stars made by cutting the background squares and triangles in half so you don't have to do set-in ""Y"" seams. I tried piecing a star this way, and the piecing is a little easier, but it is not that hard to do the set-in seams and I don't like seeing the seams in what should be solid pieces of fabric. I'm a big fan of Bethany's Stack-N-Whack books but was a bit disappointed in this one."
4,Stars a La Carte,This book was easy to follow with excellent pictures and diagrams. Lots of wonderful ideas for quilters.
5,Best MP3 player for under $200,"Here are my pro's and con's for this unit.Pro's:- Best MP3 player for under $200.- Beautiful faceplate.- Customizable displays and colors.- Great sound quality, with fully customizable Mhz output levels and preamp levels.Con's:- Track title doesn't display until 4 seconds after it's played/selected.- Even with the Loud On and the Bass turned all the way up it still does not produce enough bass."
2,disappointment,"Wasn't at all what I expected. To be honest, I was letdown, and didn't finish reading the book. It felt more like a collector's item then an a book with actual valuble information."
1,Too abstract for an Artisan,"I found this book too hard to interpret. The abstract references to characters in books that I've never read, grated on my nerves,and made me frequently skip ahead looking for something else. The brief introduction of the Artisan types at the beginning of each chapter was fairly interesting, though hardly worth the money I spent on the book. Being an ISTP Artisan, I would have preferred more specifics, More concrete examples of interactions between types."
2,The book did not tell me what Dr. Suess was really like.,"When I read a biography I expect the writer to give me some insightful glimpses into the person's character, motivations, etc. In other words, what makes the man tick. This book did not do it for me. It seemed to be written from an outsider's point of view. By someone who wrote the book using mostly secondary sources. The man was a genuis, yet, in reading the book, I still don't know him."
5,WOW! This is a fantastic pan!,"I have had a very different experience than Michael.I use a non-stick cooking spray. I have found phenomenal results when coating the cold pan thoroughly with the spray, then, using medium-high heat, waiting for the spray to brown slightly before pouring the eggs in (I use 1 full egg and 3 whites for my omelettes, make sure to beat them so the yolk is thoroughly mixed).I have never had anything stick to this pan. The inside is very smooth and will stay that way unless you use a brillo or SOS pad to clean it or a fork to mix eggs in the pan (mix before you cook, don't add milk, make sure your oil is spread evenly over the pan). This is, without a doubt, the best pan I have ever used to cook omelettes. It's a bit pricey, but with reasonable care it will certainly last more than your own lifetime."
4,Travel Adventure in Rural India,"A similarity between Chalo Dilli and Plans, Trains and Automobiles is brief and unimportant. Vinay Pathak and Lara Dutta are excellent in this film that embraces rural India and different personality types. We like more music and dancing than there is in Chalo Dilli but the songs and a little dancing are good and fit nicely into the film."
2,Floam,"This product is much messier than they show on TV. It is not mixed up well when you get it and then the goo sticks to EVERYTHING!! My kids had to mix and mix to work the stuff together, then they didn't want to play with it anymore. A real flop."
1,waste of money,Save your money. Looks like fun but is junk. We purchased the dinosaur to cover infloam. We could not get the dino together because it did not fit together. Therefore we then tried to cover it with floam. The floam did not stick. Would not accept this toy for free or even give it one star. Horrible and waste of money.
1,gross,"This stuff was very sticky, hard for a 6 year old to shape into the rectangle necessary for rolling out the pieces, just a mess. In the end we ended the project early on. We decided to keep the 'tools' and use it with play dough. The floam went into the trash and we had quite a time cleaning up the sticky beady mess."
1,Yuck- ours grew MOLD,"My 3-year-old son liked Floam because of the goop factor, but unfortunately the goop the little foam pellets are suspended in seems to be a GREAT medium for growing MOLD. This happened to us twice (despite clean hands/work space) so we gave up on it entirely.I suggest you try PlayFoam instead. It's also available here on Amazon, or at Lakeshore Learning Store (look for samples at the checkout for 49 cents!) Playfoam has a nicer consistency, less sticky (but still moldable) and no odor!"
1,horrible,"This stuff is the messiest, stickyest garbage in the history of the world. Gareenteed to make a major mess. Nothing like you see on TV! Stay away!"
1,STICKY,"My daughter asked Santa for this and only this...what a mistake! She is so disappointed. It so sticky, it is like honey with beads in it. She has some at her school that she loves that I have since discovered is Play Foam, which is a great product. We have left the lid off the Floam for 2 days and it is still too sticky to use. DO NOT BUY IT! Plus, I just discovered online that Play Foam is cheaper."
1,Floam - designed for your enemies,It's sticky and hard to manage and TERRIBLE to clean up. Buy it only for kids whose parents you don't like.
4,So much better than expected,"Although I would have given these a five star review, I have to take into my wife's account too. She liked them, but seemed to recognize that they were a substitute for normal pancakes."
4,This would be a great product for people ...,"This would be a great product for people with fragrance sensitivities. It lathered nicely and seemed to leave my skin softer and less dry. I personally prefer Dove Sensitive Skin Wash, but I found that there's no difference between their effectiveness, just scent."
3,"The Neutrogena Rainbath, Shower and Bath Gel lathers ...","The Neutrogena Rainbath, Shower and Bath Gel lathers well. However, I did not like the fact that the bath gel was unscented. It truly has NO scent and while that is better than having a too strong scent, I need a fresh scent to help wake me up in the morning! I think it would be a fabulous product for those who might be allergic to dyes and perfumes."

4,sunflower ring review,very nice and pretty ring. am not pleased with packaging. item wasrolling around loose in box.
1,Nature's Bounty cuts corners!,"they use artificial vit e. manufactured in the lab as opposed to natural e. they take a 70 IU jar and bring it down to 30 IU by adding fillers - wheat germ oil, sunflower oil, etc.garbage."
1,I used to like this product,I used to love this product 'till I found out the bottle they use is made out of a recycle plastic code #3 which is known for being toxic.Now I do not feel safe using it anymore.
3,I really don't know what to say about ...,"I really don't know what to say about this product. I'd never heard of it before and I followed the directions, which were to use five drops daily as a dietary supplement. I found no effects, positive or negative. I can't really say I'd recommend it, since I feel I'd have to use it for a much longer period to see any effects."
3,"I didn't take this orally, but used it ...","I didn't take this orally, but used it on a scar on my neck. I was hoping it would help it fade and it seems to helping a little. All in all, I like the results I've gotten so far! I'd buy this again."
4,JUST ONE COMPLAINT.,"Being an avid fan of I LOVE LUCY, I was delighted to find this new book available at the booksellers. While there are unfortunately no real surprises in presenting THE classic American sitcom information-wise, I thought that this ""coffee table"" type book was a beautiful tribute to the 50 year-old legend that is I LOVE LUCY. However, I DO have a serious qualm about the seemingly purposely gauzey and fuzzy ""look"" of the black and white photographs which are seen throughout the book; they cheapen the author's intent. It seems to me that if author Edwards wanted to present her painstaking work at its very best, she would have included gloriously pristine CLEAR and SHARP black and white photographs!! This flaw seriously takes away from the enjoyment of this otherwise generally excellent book."
2,ENOUGH ALREADY!,"As a tried and true Lucy fan, I was appalled to see the innacuracys after reading the first few pages. The musical, ""Too Many Girls"" that Dezi Arnaz starred in was written by Rodgers and Hart, NOT RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN as stated by the author. To add insult to injury ""Rodgers"" was spelled incorrectly. I know it is difficult to publish something really special after so much has been written about this amazing phenomenon, but there is no excuse for this blatent lack of accurate research."
5,Best Compilation Ever!,"It is true the 1950s was the birth of Rock & Roll, but there was so much more popular that is often ignored during that time,This compilations highlights many of those hits and the artists that performed them."
1,Not So Good Old Rock and Roll,"Original artists? Yes. Original recordings? No, unless they are demos or something. The songs on this album sound NOTHING like what we heard on the radio. This cd has a lot in common with a very high quality vacuum cleaner. It really...... you get the idea. Avoid this monstrosity."
1,Low Budget,"There's a lot of these ""oldies"" compilations that were released on tape by low budget record labels and sold for a cheap price. This is one of them.The songs? Original artists. But the songs are all ""new stereo recordings"" as they are technically called. They hired the original artists to ""re record"" the songs for their compilation album because obviously it was WAY cheaper to do then get the rights from the actual record label.Some of these albums are a mish mash of remakes and the originals (depending on what was cheaper)This one is all re records."
3,Song,"Does anyone know who the jazz song is by that was playing when Keith and Shaunte are about to have dinner, when he was explaining himself for being seen at the club with another woman. I don't know if the song was created for the movie or if it's an actual jazz song."
2,Answer To Question 1 About The Song At The Office,"The Song That Is Played When Shante And Keith Are Having Sex In His Office IS NOT On The Soundtrack But It Is At The End Of The Movie In The Songs Credits Thats Where I Found It,Its Called:""Sock It 2 Me"" By Missy Elliot Ft Da Brat!!Its Great I Just Downloaded It!!"
1,Song title,"I was wondering if anyone knew the name of the song that was playing when keith first met shante in the bar when he asked her the 3 questions. i want this cd, but want to make sure this song is on it. thanks"
5,LOVE it,I don't really need an answer because I don't have any questions. haha. But I just want to say i LOVE this soundtrack it is AWESOME! :] Vivica A Fox did FABULOUs in the movie!
5,uh...i can't find the song,"does anyone know who's the artists that sang ""two can play that game"" when the movie is over? it's the last song..i wanna get the soundtrack, but that song is not listed."
3,Here's Your Answer,The title to Keith's theme is by Cameo and it is called Shake Yo Pants... hope that info was helpful to you... your welcome in advance : )
4,Last song of the movie,does anyone know whatthe last song was and who it was by. it was on during the credits
3,Name of Song?,Does anyone know the name of the song where Shante and Keith are making out on HIS couch. Day 7 I think where she dresses up to go see him??
2,Songs,"I'm looking for the same song...ragarding the ""Can't make it, working late tonight"" scene. Does anyone know the title to that song during the scene where Shante greets Keith on the dance floor with his client???"
4,name of the song...,does anyone know the name of the song at the MGD party when keith and tony are dancing with the MGD girls while shante and co are flipping out?
4,Name of the song....,"Hello, does anyone know the artist's and name of the slow song that was played towards the end of the movie when Shante thought Keith was at her house...and she spotted him at the bar and they danced together....Thank you!"
3,Question About a Song,Does anyone know the title and artist of the song that is playingwhen she is leaving Keith's office? (She's a Bad Mama Jama?)
3,The Song during the Miller Lite Party,The song where Keith is dancin with Connie at the Miller lite party is Everydays a Party by Damozel...Ive been lookin for it forever and I finally found it. enjoy
4,"Good Plot, Good Writing",A good book that I really enjoyed. I really enjoyed the development of Sunday throughout the book and the impact of her environment and times on her. A good read worth the time and money.
4,Good read,Friend of mine who was from this area recommended this trilogy as a good read. EZ read while peddling my bike at the gym.
2,should be a **+,i liked the story line very much but found myself skimming through most of the book. the writing was very simplistic and i could not picture any of the characters except Sunday and i really could not get a great grasp on her
2,Enough already! Back off and give us a more believeable heroine,"Appreciated the first third of the book, but the main character becomes more and more unbelievable after that. Why not just stick with one thing? Why does Sunday (the heroine) have to be the world's greatest expert at everything under the sun? And, worst of all, why would this incredible fantastic blessed best-ever super-girl think it's okay to harbor an enemy soldier? Give me a break!I did enjoy meeting Captain Benjamin Searcy and the men of the Pea Island Life-Saving Station, those sections were interesting and heartening."
2,ok for $1.,The book was entertaining enough considering the bargain price. Seems like the author could not decide which heroic plot to focus on so he tried to cover them all and did not do any of them justice. Plot is far fetched at times.Descriptions of the scenery is lacking and the historical perspective is dull when it should not have been.
3,Should have made this two books instead of one,This was a great read that should have ended about at 80% of the book. The last 20% did no justice to what started out as a page turner of a fiction based on good geographical and historical believability. Mr. Lewis seemed more interested in setting up his second book in a trilogy than writing a good book. The last 20% of the book was just plain unbelievable foolishness that became a a page hopper over a page turner. It would have been nice to develop Sunday over setting up his next book. I felt cheated by the reentry of Keane character and his stupid sidekick and the obvious pain the editor must have had trying to help Mr. Lewis make make sense of his ending. The 3 stars is a 5 star story with 2 stars removed for a good writer not knowing how to end a book. The book is worth reading a good story overall.
1,Disappointing,"Sunday's Childwas very disappointing and I gave up on it after about 15%. It's possible things get better after I stopped reading, but it seems quite unlikely. From my perspective, the author fails to make the events and characters interesting. I've read books depicting historical lifestyles that are insightful and vital. This one is a definite ho hum. Even at the bargain price of $1, I wouldn't recommend it."
4,This book touched me....,"An interesting read centering around the life and adventures of an interracial girl named Sunday who was raised by the crew of an all black Life-Saving Station on the coast of N. Carolina... yet it is about so much more than just this. It is about the struggles of blacks and mixed race people, it is about self pride, WW2, racial bias, forgiveness, compassion, and an inner determination to not only survive but also to be fiercely independent & proud of who you are. Filled with characters you can care about, a tad rough in spots writing wise but over all... it's one of those books you can curl up with a in comfy chair and never notice time rushing by."
5,don't miss this one,I had no idea what I was getting into when I thought I would try this book due to the price. It is as good as a full cost book and better than many of them. The historical setting is interesting and the author doesn't spare the reader fear. I have since read another book by this author which is very similar and entertaining. This book is one of my must reads.
5,Best Bang for Your Buck!!!,"Who gave this a horror tag? Anyway, one the best books I've read in awhile...and only a dollar!!!! Please buy this book...you will fall in love with Sunday Everette."
1,"Randy (Ottawa, Canada)","I thought with 10 five star reviews this would be great value for the $3 I paid. Wrong, wrong, wrong!!!After finishing this lame piece of work (I say finish but I actually skipped the last third to finish my misery) I checked about the author to confirm that he is in fact a high school student doing grade 9 english. Wrong again!How can an adult come up with such a juvenile storyline, such stilted dialogue and such an unbelievable heroine?The first third was OK but then the""author"" (and I use the term loosely) got carried away with himself and unfortunately had no one to keep him in check. What might have been a sweet story of a strong girl rising above adversity became a cartoon. Totally beyond reality and totally boring.To all those that gave this 5 stars, you owe me."
5,Best hot sauce ever!!!,"Read the title of the review. I assure you, that is not opinion but stone-cold fact.Marie Sharp's is the best hot sauce currently existing or ever to have existed on Earth or on other hot sauce-consuming planets."
1,Intuit FINALLY fixes major bugs in its updates!!!...,"Intuit has indeed corrected the problems with the Mac updates!! UNFORTUNATELY, it took them so long that I was forced to wait over 5 WEEKS!! Although they were able to fix this mess with those machines still running OS 8.1/8.5, I WILL NO LONGER PURCHASE TURBOTAX. I can't tell you how MANY hours were wasted downloading files that would not install on a Macintosh with 0S 8.5.1. I will give Tax Cut a try next year."
1,"Updated review on a bad, bad program...","Warning: Intuit does not tell you this... While the CD-ROM will install properly on any Mac with OS 8.1+, ALL THE UPDATES IN FEBRUARY WILL NOT COMPLETELY INSTALL (ONE FILE WILL NOT INSTALL) UNLESS YOU HAVE 9.0+!!!! I was told this less than an hour ago by a rep. I can't believe they advertise that this program will work fine with OS 8.1+!!! You can forget the updates on any machine running 8.5 like mine!! ... Makes you wonder if they will EVER fix this update bug!!"
2,On the down slide,"Many errors, awkward. I've used Macintax and turbo tax for many years. This year was the most problem filled one yet. Ane they make the filing rebate harder and harder to collect.My last year with this."
1,Turbo Tax is only for Mac,"This product is only for Mac, we need it for XP, please, tell us how can we return it."
1,The 8 year love affair is over!,Isn't it a shame that they are treating their customerslike this. I have loved the program over the yearsbut they won't get my money again until they get rid ofthe big brother attitude.Bye Intuit!
1,I used to believe!,"Turbo Tax, in my opinion is a great program. Unfortunately, Intuit has instituted policies on the Windows version which are unacceptable. For the Mac version, they apparently weren't able to do this, instead they decided to just charge 25 percent more for the same program. These are unacceptable business practices which I will no longer be a part of. As of next year, I am switching to Tax Cut. A program which costs the same for both platforms..."
1,Worse every year!,"This is my 10th year buying this tax program, and I'm really disappointed. It displayed the recursive update problem others have reported about in this review section (update over and over again, and it still would like me to update again). I guess that's fixed now, but at one point none of my forms W-2 ended up on line 7 of my 1040, which is great for lowering my taxes due, but not correct. Now that mysterious omission has moved on to line 8a, none of my interest income appears there despite it appearing on Schedule B line 4 (which reads ""Enter result here and on form 1040, line 8a""). The state filing used to be a simple download, but now you have to buy it and get a rebate to pay the difference (not including sales tax). But the ""purchase"" button on the web page that TurboTax directs you to doesn't work -- I push it, and all I get is a spinning watch. I tried reporting these bugs to Intuit via their bug feedback page, but no response."
1,"At Intuit, Customer Service and Tech Support are oxymorons","If you suffer from low blood pressure, trying to use this product is a great way to elevate it in a hurry. First, you have to download a huge update file to make the program current. Second, part of that file, the now infamous mfdiper section, wouldn't download for me and I am running System 9.2 (Intuit admits it won't work with System 8). WARNING: mfdiper can cause system freezes. Third, after failing to download the update file I tried to contact Intuit for tech support. The live chat box came up and promptly, filled with hundreds of lines of computer code. I was unable to get through with online chat which precluded any chance of calling their service number to pay for the privilege of finding out why their download won't download. I, too, am a long time turbotax user but this was the last straw. No wonder Intuit stock was just downrated..."
4,Polished Marble Urn,This Urn was exactly what i was wanting to satisfy our needs in placing our sons remains in. It came in a very nice box and represented our family well. Shipping and Handling went without incident and was on time. Very Nice Urn.
4,Wish it was available in Blu-ray,I love this series. So peaceful. Too bad it is standard def. Ran on PBS HD a lot a few years ago. Looking forward to it being available on Blu-ray from KUED someday.
4,Small but entertaining,"I bought this for my almost 7 year old daughter for Christmas because she loves the movie ""Spirit- Stallion of the Cimmaron"". I was a little disappointed that the horses were so small, but I probably should have read the description better. I think my daughter would have enjoyed a bigger horse. The plastic that the horses are made from is brittle and my experience with this type of plastic is that the extremities will break off ( ie. the legs and tail). Other than those two disappointments, my daughter was very excited to receive this gift and would like the set with Rain, the other horse in the movie. (I'm telling you, she is really into this movie!)"
4,Paella Power!,Loved the pan - had to get the lid too! Really helps to keep the paella warm and also to keep the moisture in. All I need now is a really great sangria recipe!

1,Green eggs and Sam,"I really loved Second Encounter, so I persisted for several hours beforeuninstalling. The game has such a kiddy feel you find yourself looking forthat purple dinosaur we all love to hate. Mood of the background music isjust wrong, the cut-scenes are often distracting, and the level designis cramped compared to Second Encounter.My thanks to Croteam for their earlier work - never died so many timeswhile laughing! But this...just gonna pass."
3,"NOT THAT GOOD, BUT OKAY!","Oh my god! A new SERIOUS SAM game! Alright!! Wait,before you rush over to the nearest game store, listen up! Okay, to begin with, the game's graphics suck on PC. Very good graphics on XBOX. Next, the framerate is the worst! It always bogs down! Next, Some of the humor in the game is to....well... bad! They try way to hard on coming up with humor. Everything else is alright. The level designing, weapons, sound, and blood and gore, and very weird monsters! Buy it if you must, but try to rent it for the XBOX or borrow from a friend and try it out first. mr.jawsbiteme."
1,Not nearly as good or fun as the first,"If you liked the first Serious Sam, do not tarnish your memory of it with this game. It is clear that not enough time was dedicated to development because the game is riddled with glitches (and not fun, exploitable ones either). The game itself is nothing special, it does not do anything for the storyline if that is what you are interested in, and is mostly frustrating to play given all the issues the game has. At that rate, I think for $5 it would be worth buying, but $10? Eh...."
2,Infantile,"This game is designed for a twelve year old mentality. The jokes are childish, stupid and the gameplay is repetitious, predictable and boring. Entirely script driven; advance till you hit a trigger point, kill 80 million monsters, get an extra life and some other rewards, advance to the next trigger point, repeat, repeat. Basically, you are required to navigate down a highly defined, pre-determined ""go-right"" path with no variation. Want to jump on some barrels, get on top of that building? Nope, off-limits, move along now.Graphically it looks pretty good, but the cutscenes are pre-rendered, the water effects are static (guess I'm stilled spoiled by HL2). At least it was only $30."
4,Why didn't I play this a long time ago?,"OK so I admit, I thought this was just another Duke Nukem ripoff... and I was right... but the story and character you play isn't what I expected at all. This game is absolutely wacky. They make fun of the ""serious"" title constantly. It's like the movie ""Mars Attacks"" that was totally off the wall. Very refreshing. The only part that was horrible was the ending. But I still wish I would have picked it up in the store when I saw it a year ago."
4,"Fun game, but not as good as it's predecessors","I enjoyed Sam 2 a lot, but it lacks the spirit of the first two Sam games, and the voume of baddies, while present here, just doesn't seem as consistent and challenging as the first games.I can live without the potty humor too."
4,Serious Sam 2,"This is an awesome old school shoot-em up. Whenever you need a break from ""realistic"" shooters like Call of Duty this is worth a shot. I've always been a big fan of the series and this didn't disappoint. Big guns, gig bosses, and tons of monstrous enemies to waste. This game makes you feel like the ultimate badass while still keeping a sense of humor. A great game worth almost anyone's time."
4,Would recommend. Makes it easy. Impress your friends.,"The only flaw I think it has is that some areas could have used more detail as the book is for beginners. There was at least one place where it said to take the long side, but it really meant the short side of a cut piece of fabric. I think other beginner sewing books describe in more detail, however, with a little guessing and testing, I was able to make a lovely, custom crib set for my baby. I would still highly recommend using this book to make your own baby items for a custom, personalized look and to save lots of money."
4,"Worthy of the name ""Ethereal""","The swirling pastel colors on the cover couldn't fit this CD's contents any better. I am pleased to report that Ethereal: Melodic Trance delivers just what the name implies... instrumental electronic trance music with a relaxing, atmospheric theme. Every song on this compilation maintains a steady high bpm, but for the most part it does not have the hyper-fast whirling feel of goa or psytrance. Just imagine a half-way point between techno and new age music and you're in the ballpark. Sure, the mixing job could have been better, but this is a pretty good compilation from beginning to end. If you like any type of instrumental electronic music, I recommend picking up Ethereal. It might not have the staying power of other compilations of this type, but it's a great CD to pop in while driving or working."
5,Oh My Dear Lord,"This CD is awesome! For the connoisseur hunting for the best Melodic Trance, you have found a precious gem! It is mesmerizing! Get it, and also get More Ethereal Melodic Trance. It is equally awesome."
5,Ethereal: Melodic Trance!,"This CD is one of my favorites, but there isn't enough tracks on it! I have always gone for the trance music at my local ""Worst Sale"" (pun intended), with my first cd being the 2000 Best Of Trance (not the one in amazon). The CD's melodic tracks are wonderful, with many bass-sound hats! Strings in a trance rules!"
2,Critical Omission,"Wow! I could not believe it! Nowhere in the hike descriptions does the author state the DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY. This is ""must have"" information, especially for those who are hiking on Oahu for the first time. I keep looking at the the hikes thinking I've simply missed it, but alas, this information is not available. How much more costly could it have been to add: Easy/Moderate/Difficult before the verbiage on each hike. Very disappointing, and potentially dangerous.Another thing I would have like to have seen are GPS coordinates. They make getting to trailheads much easier and if a few trail site waypoints are included, it can give hikers much needed assurance that they are on the right path."
3,Easy Listening,"Not such a great film but quite a nice soundtrack. All the tracks are fairly easy listening. Nothing heavy or anything like that. All enjoyable and plesant listening. Real stand-outs from the album are Stay, I Need Love, and The Garden of You and I. I will say that I was a little disappointed that Black Balloon by The Goo Goo Dolls and Bye Bye by Marcy Playground were missed off but it certainly doesn't stop me enjoying this CD."
2,HOW COME?,"I couldn`t believe when I read the soundtrack and I noticed that the two bests songs of the movie were missing! Groove is in the heart (Dee Lite) and Let's stay together. And I was only going to buy the cd because of these two songs. I was so ansious to buy it that i was not going to wait for it to come to Brazil. Well, I`m very, very sorry."
3,Down to you,i really liked both the Cd and the movie but i was misisng the two songs from the movie that Imogen and Al sung too...one was by Barry White and then other i cant remember
4,Enjoyed it-but there is something missing.....,"No, I'm not looking for Barry, or Al, or Dee Lite. =) there is a song played at the end, when he opens the present and she comes back to him. It is also in a Ralph Lauren commercial. Please, someone, ANYONE! let me know. Thanks."
2,not really meditation music,This IS classical but NOT meditative at all. Some of the pieces are counter meditative and agitating. Find OTHER options if meditating is your goal.
3,I've used this product for about a week ...,"I've used this product for about a week now, and overall I would say that I liked it, but probably won't buy it. I liked the scent, and the way the pump spray worked. However, I felt that the oil didn't spread well on my skin, and that I had to use an awful lot of the product to get my skin moisturized."
4,Good Book,If you are a person that likes books that move along slowly and switches between different plots throughout the whole book you would like Nobody Was Here. The protagonist is a nice young lady who seems like she wants to do things her own ay. Tha antagonists are Pia and Anabella who are always mean to Penelope but not to stacy. Stacy has been leaving Penelope for Pia and Anabella. The book was not as good as i thought it was going to be because it was tiresome at some points. The story moves along slowly and switches between different plots.
4,Fun book about teenage life in the 80's,This was a great book re-awakening that oh so preppy life of a teenager growing up in the 80's at a NY prep school. Tretorn nylites ARE important and its not just if they are white or blue but how you lace them. The book delves into when your lacoste polo is best worn collar up and when your LL Bean bluchers should be worn with-out the socks. It is a lot of fun and brings back good memories.
2,pout-pourri,"it's a cd for beginners of baroque music, all the others better buy other versions of this music."
4,Folk art with a natural touch,"The main quilt is shown on the front. Inside the authors have complete fabric requirement and cutting directions for this piece as well as seven smaller projects. These use many of the motifs from the large quilt as well as adding some smaller original elements. The freezer paper method used for the appliqué puts the paper on the right side of the fabric, thereby skipping the tedious tearing out step. These are simple projects, well described and, except for the main quilt, all easily finished in a day or two. Several would be perfect for the man in your life. Many of the motifs would be excellent on vests or jackets."
3,Good Hard Rock,"I find this album hard to take when played all at once, some of the tracks are a little less memorable, and sound similarly like... well, other tracks on the same album. I do like the tracks when mixed on shuffle on my MP3 player though, so...Good stuff, nice hard edge to the music, some good use of rhythmic stuff along with backing tracks and intros, like it."
2,Seriously bad accordian disco polka music,"I picked this up out of a clearance bin somewhere. It's wonderful music for torturing teenagers with. Accordians! Playing camp songs! DISCO style! If you like weird, this is a great album. Be warned, though, it will ruin several songs forever. Worse than a whole can of earworms."
2,Not the greatest,"I agree with other commenters that it's fantastic to have a women's anthology of comics, but the strips contained in this collection are mediocre at best, with two stories (the first and last, oddly enough) being the only memorable or well-told and rendered tales. With as many fantastic female story tellers and illustrators/comic artists putting out great work, I'd hoped for much, much better than this collection had to offer."
4,WESTERN CHIEF INFANT/TODDLER FROG RUBBER CLOG,GREAT TO HAVE THE CHILDREN TO PUT ON WITH OUT AND ARGUEMENTNICE DESIGNS FOR THEM AS WELL
3,Sweet but useless:),"I bought these clogs-frogs for my son. He just adores them and wants to go out wearing them. They look very cute... BUT!!! They are absolutely useless during rainy weather, cause they slip off the foot and the kids foot is still wet, cause these shoes do not have anything at the back. So we are having them just for fun. As for the rains - I ended up with buying rainy boots."
4,Eastern meditation,"While not as good as the first Buddha and Bonsai. This is still a beautiful collection of Asian music and instruments. It's a lovely CD to listen to while meditating, relaxing or just sitting outside in the sun doing nothing."
2,Top Heavy,"The pictures far outweigh the words in this book, which are strictly filler. Yet strangely enough all the pictures aren't captioned. While some are very nice and most are in color, the end result is very light cofee table fare."
4,On Food and Cooking,"Again, not what I expected and a bit dated. Would've liked more history and detail. Nonetheless, a good gift for the aspiring chef in the family."
4,"If you are serious about food, get it.",A book of the why's of cooking. It is a very complicated book if you are not really IN to food science and cooking.
1,Way too technical for the average cook!,"This book is much more about science than cooking. The content is much more technical than most readers will desire (as with, the discussion of the molecular structure of milk in its various states)."
3,Deep knowledge...too deep.,"I enjoy cooking. I like science. I wanted to introduce the two. After reading ""the making of a chef"" (Ruhlman) where McGee's book is one of the 3 bibles, I had to get it. I read for about a week, got to page 100-something, and got a bit tired of it. I'm no idiot, and my knowledge in chemistry is pretty good, but sometimes the book would just bore me abit. A bit too much science and too little of how the science affects the cooking. I would want more of ""why the thick crust bread is thick"" and ""beat your egg-whites with a cold beater"" (cooking science tips) and less molecule explanations."
5,Excellent Reference Book,A great book to compliment cookbooks. No serious kitchen should be without it.
5,One incredible read!,"I feel compeled to defend Mr. McGee from the comments of the previous reviewer (turnipseed from texas). Wow, this book isn't for the average cook. Thanks for the info. I doubt the average cook even cooks (Mac and Cheese, Hamburger Helper and meatloaf don't count), let alone uses a cookbook. This is a book for nerds, geeks, gourmands, epicures and other enlightened types. Sorry for the vitriol. This is a fantastic book, one of my favorites. Did you ever wonder how long you should cook broccoli? The answer is inside along with an explanation as to why the aroma changes when you've over cooked it."
4,"A great, light body lotion","Neutrogena's Light Sesame Formula is a light, non-greasy feeling lotion that dissapears once you rub it in. Your skin feels soft and clean rather than covered in a heavy lotion. I prefer to use it on my face as I have sensative and slightly oily skin."
4,This is a very nice lotion. It has ...,"This is a very nice lotion. It has a very pleasant smell and isn't greasy at all like some lotions that I've tried. I would definitely purchase this product again in the future, and I've recommended it to other family members. My skin gets very dry in the winter months and this lotion seems to have helped a little better than others."
4,My mom and I used the cream many ...,"My mom and I used the cream many times. Mainly because we both get dry skin, I have to say that we loved it. My mom is definitely gonna buy it again. It smells pretty nice, too."
5,Neutrogena,"I received this lotion from a hotel while on a trip. Loved it so much I tracked it down and ordered it on Amazon since I could not find in stores. The lotion is great and does not leave a sticky feeling, the smell is very light and fresh."
5,Refuse to live without ! !!!!!!!,"I have been using this lotion for years, it is truly fabulous for all year round. It has a light and wonderful aroma,and it makes my legs look so smooth and sexy!"
1,Not what I was hoping for!,"My husband and I love the NY Times Sunday xword puzzles, but we don't subscribe to the paper and purchase it sporadically. I thought it would be great (and cheaper!) to have a book of authentic Sunday xwords to take with us on vacations. We did the first one but found that it didn't feel like the puzzles we know and love. These puzzles are from the 80s and don't seem to have the same clever guiding themes, and many of the pop culture clues were outdated. The font is different, the puzzle style felt different, it just wasn't satisfying! So our puzzle book is in a drawer and we're back to buying the Sunday paper when we have a puzzle craving!"
4,A solid mic. Great for singing instrumentalists,"It is comfortable to wear. The behind-the-head style is far better than over-the-top-of-the-head. The sound is what you would expect from a Shure microphone: strong, clean sound. Can't complain about it at all. We use it for our drummer to sing in our band."
3,"Good mic, bad headset",I've use Shure microphones for 30 years or more and this is the first time I've been disappointed. The microphone itself was fine but it was so difficult to get the mic in position and keep it there that I had to give up and return the item. I went back to using my WH20XLR which has a different type of connector between the mic and the headband.
4,What's to say this is Jerry Jeff Walker,This is a great CD if your familliar with Jerry Jeff Walker's music then you already know you like his styal and voice
3,Disappointed,"Well, it just didn't give me the feelings I had when I was younger and listened to his music... Don't know why..."
3,Interesting,"This book, as well as the author in general, sets out to explain the very highest. The author judging by the way he writes obviously views himself as some kind of messiah that is not justified by the sometimes confusing explanations.In truth, the book could be useful to help understand various topics although the way it is written comes across as egotistical and as though the author is demanding rather than explaining."
2,Nothing Special,"Hybrid hardbound coffee table book combining the lesser aspects of Joe Benson's ""Buyer's Guide"" and the late Osprey/Octopus Great Marques Alfa picture book edition of the series. Why bother...."
2,warped lids,"We ordered this product and the lid was warped, the replacement that was sent was also warped!"
5,The Lobster Pot,"When summer is here, my Calphalon Commercial Hard-Anodized 16-Quart Stock Pot with Lid gets a lot of use in the kitchen. For a Fourth of July celebration, we put water in this pot with whole red potatoes and sweet corn on the cob. We parboil these vegetables for about five minutes, then add more water and a couple of bottles of clam juice and then a few dozen steamers. While the pot is cooking, we add more hot water and some seaweed and cover it with the lid. After 5 minutes, we put in a few 2 1/2-pound whole Maine lobsters. After the cooking is completed, we remove and drain everything and arrange each person's lobster, steamers, and vegetables on a small oval platter for serving. Thick creamy New England clam chowder is also served, along with Pilot crackers and crusty Italian bread.A wonderful dinner from a wonderful Calphalon pot!"
1,There is no scientific proof Mederma works,"Okay, so, before researching this product at all, I was using it, because of all the hype and ads on TV. Whenever I had a big scar or one I wanted to fade fast I would purchase Mederma, use it for a few months straight, and quit in disappointment. And I never noticed a difference; scars took just as long to fade with Mederma or without.Well, to put it bluntly, there have been very few trials with Mederma and of those, one found no significant difference of Mederma vs. placebo, and one found effective results... in rabbits.Well, the active ingredient in Mederma is onion. So, maybe save your money and apply diluted onion juice !Silicone sheets (and to a lesser extent gels) have really helped my scars and there have been many studies showing their effectiveness. Vitamin E, Mederma, etc though are just snake oil."
3,Mederma for scars,I got this in the summer. It is now November; No change on 20-30 yr. old scars. I don't know how it is on new scars
4,Works Great For Acne Scars,"This product really works for acne scars! I've gone through a few tubes of this and I've noticed that my scars have lessened quite a bit. They are not as red and some have gone away completely. I put it on at night before bed and when i wash my face in the morning my skin looks brighter and clearer. However, it does over dry the face a lot so I would not recommend using it every single day. I use it every other day or every three days, depending on how my skin is doing. It works but it also has its drawbacks. Either way, I recommend it."
5,mederma,"At 9:30 a.m. Thanksgiving day I was bit in the face by a family dog. It was an accident, but this product was recommended by my doctor and seems to be helping with the scarring and healing."
1,Awful,Old cream. Leaves residue all over face. Does not rub in at all and has not visibly helped with scarring.
4,mole removed,"I had a mole removed off my back for the second time now because of it being cancerous. And I started first using bio oil. And I got pimples all around it. So we switched to this. We're in the first week, and it seems to be helping. Just softening it so far. Will update when I notice both color and size."
1,Allergic Reaction,"Unfortunately, I had a bad reaction to this product.I got a terrible rash that ended up spreading and making my skin a hot mess. Be careful if you have sensitive skin."
4,It does work--but you will need to keep buying it.,"You will definitely see an improvement in your scars. I repeat that again with emphasis: you will see an improvement. I have to tell you that the improvement won't be until you use maybe five or more tubes over five months. The tube is not that large and it doesn't last all that long. It is costly, no matter where you buy it--the Internet or your local store. But, it is the only scar product I have tried that does what it says it will do---so for the third time: don't expect your scars to be 100% gone, even after five or six tubes. BUT: you will be pleased---very, very pleased, indeed. I would say a 90% improvement, and that is wonderful. But not from one tube. I do recommend it and I like it. Not messy and don't use too much as it flakes off. Follow directions. It is a fine product, but buy in bulk!!!"
1,Deceptive advertising by Beauty Time,"Did not use the product as it is not what I expected, therefore, the rating is for Beauty Time, not the product.The supplier, Beauty Time, posted a picture of a box of ADVANCED mederma in the ad, but sent regular mederma.Advanced mederma is applied once a day, regular mederma, a different product, is applied 3 times a day.The product was returned to Beauty Time using the return label sent, but was never acknowledged by Beauty Time,nor was any money refunded by Beauty Time. Amazon credited my account for the amount paid. Thank you, Amazon."
3,its alright,The product probably worked a little for me. Too little to notice. So im not sure if i would get it again.
4,Good product. Working so far,I have been using this product on burn scars and have been working very good. It's look like it is going away. My only criticism is that it takes time.
2,It might work if I didn't get hives from it...,"I had surgery a few months ago and ended up with 3 incisions on my belly. I wanted this stuff to work before bikini season but every time I try it I brake out. It starts out as just itching and before I know it, hives all over my stomach. I do see the smallest hint of the scars starting to lighten though!"
2,mederma skin cream,this product made me itch uncontrollably on the second day. had to switch to the spf version which doesn't itch. still waiting to see results.
2,it's just sunscreen,"I work in a pharmacy, and the general opinion of our pharmacists is that mederma is basically just sunscreen, which aids in the prevention of scarring, but is not for the treatment of older scars. They also say the only thing that breaks down scar tissue is silicone, and the only good (and affordable) cream that contains this ingredient is Scarzone. Mederma does not contain this ingredient."
3,"Meh. Okay, but...","I started using Mederma after I had a rather unsightly bright red acne scar on my forehead. I ended up having the same problem another review on here had. It irritated my skin and made my scar even more noticable. For that reason, I would not recommend it for use on your face as it can irritate your skin. I'd suggest using Neutrogena's acne mark fading peel for face acne.However, Mederma has successfully faded some other scars that were not on my face. So, in the end it's worth buying still."
1,not for sensitive skin,"Do not use this product if you tend to have sensitive skin. I have been applying it on a few small scars for a couple of weeks now, and now I have a wide spread rash encompassing the entire area! Sometimes new products cause a little rashing, so I decided to try to tough it out til my skin grew accustomed to it, but it only got worse and worse, and it seems to be making my scars darker! Going back to vitamin E, even though it smells bad, at least I know it wont cause horrible side effects!"
1,Snake oil,"Mederma was a subject of a scientific study (citation below), and it was found to be no more effective than petroleum jelly.The people whose scars have improved over months of using Mederma would have seen the same results if they left the scars alone or applied petroleum jelly. In fact, most scars spontaneously reduce in redness and prominence over the course of several months. The only therapy that might be better than placebo are silicone gels, pads, etc. Don't waste your money on this.Chung VQ, Kelley L, Marra D, Jiang SB (February 2006). ""Onion extract gel versus petrolatum emollient on new surgical scars: prospective double-blinded study"". Dermatol Surg 32 (2): 193-7."
2,I have kind of side effect from it..,"It was really strange experience for me. At the first time, it was ok after applying but at 2nd time, my face got so itch that I couldn't even sleep at all. After that night, I do not use this anymore. Maybe it's just me or my sensitive skin. I do liked the price, speedy shipping but this wasn't for me."
3,fine no major results,I have not really seen any major results but maybe some slight results i am questioning if even that but using it for a while so even if it works it does take a long long time
2,"Not sure. Itchy itchy, and more itchy","I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning, but then around week 3, it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend, who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months, I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said, it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy, and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus, I think a little of the coloring has gone down, but it is hard to tell."
1,Mederma Just Creates New Problems,"Mederma Skin Care For Scars did indeed smooth out my stretch marks, but the places that I used it made my skin darker! Now I have to use another product to lighten the dark spots. If you are a Black woman, like me, and prone to hyperpigmentation, do not use this product!!!"
1,It's no better than inexpensive alternatives.,"Science journals have reported on Mederma compared to petroleum jelly for treating scars, and they concluded there was no difference.Sources:Shih, Richard, and Joshua Waltzman. ""Review of Over-the-Counter Topical Scar Treatment Products."" Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2007): 1091-5.Zurada, Joanna, David Kriegel, and Ira Davis. ""Topical treatments for hypertrophic scars."" Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology 55(2006): 1024-31."
1,Did not work for me,I used it for 12 weeks on my c-section scar. Started using it about 2 weeks after the surgery. Never saw any results.
1,Yuck!,"I bought this product after hearing friends rave about it. Well, I have been using it for a while now and dislike it for the following reasons:- The perfume in this product irritated my fresh scars. I was sore and itchy. (There were no open wounds)- The gel dries to a film which rubs off your skin and can best be described as looking like dandruff everywhere you had applied it. This may not be a big deal if you only apply a small amount to a small scar, but take larger scars, and it is a mess.This was my first time using this product and it will be my last. For the price, I am not impressed!"
4,I noticed a difference,I noticed stretch marks on abdomen got lighter and less noticeable. It doesn't take them away. It is very true that stretch marks are permanent because your middle layer of skin has actually torn. This product can be pricey but it is worth the money especially if you don't have many stretch marks. But if you have a lot of large ones You can try a TCA chemical peel. I have noticed that they strengthen the skin by improving collagen and elastin production which in proper amts keeps the skin from tearing.
1,It does nothing,"I used it on both a new scar and an old one daily for 3 months, it has done absolutely nothing to either scar. Total waste of $25&#12290;"
2,I see no difference...,"I've been using mederma since August 2010, My surgery was June 23rd 2010, I honestly see no difference. I was using it daily. Since I saw no difference, I was getting cortizone shots from my surgeon which would make the scars go down for a little bit and then they would raise again, those were a hassle, because I had to go in every 2 weeks. I think Kelo-cote works better, and I'm soon going to try Scarprin.I also don't like how Mederma dries. It dries almost like how Elmer's glue dries. It peels off easily and gets on everything. Kelo-cote dries like a sticky adheasive (which I also didn't like)."
1,I would never buy this product again,"I had a few small scars on my upper chest, I bought this product and the itching was just unbearable. I noticed that everytime I scratched it left scrath marks on my chest, the scaring got worse and now it's a huge area that has spread.the scar got worse.I will never buy or recommend this product to anyone."
1,HORRIBLE,"I know this product may work for some people but it didn't work at all for me. I followed the directions and used the gel 3 times on scar on my forehead. The gel has left a very dark spot in the middle of my forehead so i had to stop using it. It did't reduce my scar appearance at all and now not only do i still have a very horrible scar, now i have a very ugly dark spot in the center of my forehead that i can't get rid of. My advice is don't waste your money on this crap it was a total waste of money and now i have two scars thanks to using this crap."
2,Do not expect a miracle,I first tried Mederma back in the early 2000's. It didn't do much although I used exactly as was instructed on the tube. Was in an accident a couple of months ago and decided to try once more. No improvement. Using the cocoa butter stick has the same exact results and much cheaper. Save your money and just buy a cocoa butter stick or use Vitamin E oil. Same result.
2,been using it for a long time,i have been using this scar for a really long time every since i was 12 or 13 and im 20 now i used it once continuously and stopped after like 2 years .. it did nothing .. but my sisters still use it and i see no difference in their scars as well and shes been using it for like 6 years ...
1,Beware to apply this on toddlers,Is there a negative rating option ?? -1000000000000 rating from my end.I read good feedback about this product and bought for a scar on face of my son (2 yr and 9months). I applied as directed once a day. Next day he had a lot of small bumps around the area where it was applied and kept on growing in size and area. After couple of days his face turned red due to allergic reaction of this cream. I was very concerned and stopped applying this cream.The bumps went away after few days.I wouldn't apply this cream even on my scars....
1,Buyer Beware,"I purchased this product per a recommendation from my Doctor after surgery on my face for a basel cell.BUYER BEWARE! I had a extremely horrible reaction after applying the product according to it's instructions, my skin burned in the scar site, exactly where you don't want a problem you had to have surgery for in the beginning. I have called Mederma and all they have done is take my name...etc. I will notify my Dermatologist, and I would like all to know that buyer's should be aware that it is not ""uncommon"" (Mederma's quote) for a person to have a reaction from the product according to the company. Amazon is not at fault; I constantly trust them to provide me with most products I buy; but I would recommend they stop selling the products of Mederma!"
3,It's good...but not GREAT,"Although I must admit that I am a HUGE fan of ""I Wanna Talk About Me""...as well as being a big Toby Keith fan in general, I will say that this album isn't incredible. It has a few catchy tunes, and the first two singles are good, but other than those, it doesn't seem to many that many of the songs really stand out. It was a pretty good album, but I disagree with the opinion that it is phenomenal. There's just enough there to make it a good album, but not enough substance to make it truly great."
5,Toby's best CD ever,"I went and bought this album the night that it came out. I liked ""I'm Just Talkin' about Tonight"" ever since I first saw the video on CMT. I thought the video was the funniest country music video that I had ever seen. I literally laughed until I cried. The new CD ""Pull my chain"" is one of Toby's best CDs that I've ever listened to. Some other great songs on the album are: ""Pull my Chain"" and ""Pick 'em Up and lay 'em Down."""
5,Toby has pulled it off again - Awesome Sound!,Toby Keith has again proved to everyone just how talented he is. This CD is extremely upbeat and fun. The songs keep you singing along through the entirety.I have two daughters who insist on listening to the CD over and over. The song 'I wanna talk about Me' is their absolute favorite.I have not heard anyone say anything negative about this compilation. I know that this household gives Toby 5 stars!!!
1,A new low in popular country music,"That this CD has garnered so much attention (in terms of sales) for Toby Keith is indicative of the current state of popular country music. The music is so formulaic, its hard to believe. Its almost fun to listen to just to be amazed at how this stuff can actually sell. Like watching a really bad movie and laughing at the incompetence. The song ""I Wanna Talk About Me"" is in this category. The lyrics are oh-so-clever, for example: ""I like talkin' about you, you, you, you, usually."" Popular country loves such ""clever"" turns on phrases. Writers take cliched lines and beat them senseless (Toby's last effort was named ""How Do You Like Me Now"").Pure cheese, amazingly poor, so bad its funny."
3,Just toby being toby,I think he does a great job of bringing out his fun personality in his music. THis is good modern country.
5,Great cd!,Tracks...1) Seventeen2) Don't Care Who Knows (album mix feat.

3,not as expected,these shoes are way tight and did not loosen up after I wore them twice. I have not had luck with them and I bought them in black and tan so I am out some money on shoes I can't wear.
5,Laugh out loud funny,The story is hilarious. David Tennant and Kelly MacDonald are great and both give several moments where you will be literally laughing out loud.
4,adorable,cute romantic comedy with plenty of David Tennet for the Who fans that miss him. the setting is picturesque with quirky locals and ruins galore.
4,Cute,"Absolutely adorable rom-com. It plays a bit by the numbers. I wish they'd have let David Tennant be a bit more charming rather than the straight man. But overall the storyline just works, especially with the two scene-stealing assistants & the scene-stealing Island folks."
2,"A few good moments, otherwise bleh","A completely implausible, trite romcom with a ridiculous premise. A couple of the interactions were amusing, but you can find a better movie to watch tonight, I assure you."
1,Disappointing,"This film was a real disappointment. With the promising ingredients of a good cast and beautiful setting I expected it to be at least halfway decent, but it was let down by being very poorly written and having a plot that was completely implausible."
2,"A total chick flick, but...","not worth the time. Do not be misled by the 4.5 star rating. If this was a romantic comedy, then it completely left out the comedy portion of the movie. At least Alice Eve does a great job of being smoking hot, as usual."
5,Very cute,I great little film. It was fun to watch and put a smile on my face. All the acting was fantastic. If you're looking for a sweet little romantic comedy this is definitely a good choice.
4,cute movie,"cute, date night type of movie. Typical rom-com, but cute supporting cast, nothing offensive and everyone comes out a winner. Would definitely recommend this movie."
1,Seriously?,"This movie was unrealistic, and probably for people who live on the moon. I do not see what the hype was all about."
1,Terribly dull & predictable,"The movie was long and boring. The characters were dull. The only character I liked (which was the only one truly developed) was the main character... I don't even remember her name~!! I just felt like I wasted my time... I shouldn't have watched the entire movie, but did just so I can give an honest opinion/review."
4,A Cutely Delightful Movie,"I rented this movie on a whim one night thinking it wouldn't be much of anything. I was delightfully surprised by it! It was very cute and sweet and I laughed out loud several times. Both David Tennant and Kelly Macdonald were funny, charming, and had perfect movie chemistry. I liked it so much I watched it again during the rental period and then immediately ordered my own copy. If your in the mood for a light and cute comedy look no further then this delightful movie!"
4,Cute,I enjoyed this movie. I would describe it as a classic romantic comedy that makes you feel 'fuzzy'. thats all
4,Wonderful light reading,"I enjoyed this digital book, and the historical references are just fascinating. The ""romantic"" part of the book -- which I understand is necessary to boost sales -- got really tedious for me. Ms. Ryan wasted several pages laboring the point that Phillipa and Hugh harbored secret longings for each other. Geez, enough already! But it's easy to skim over that crap, and the intrigue and period descriptions were truly engrossing. Ms. Ryan really researches her history!The other problem with the Kindle edition is the annoying typos. The Italian word for ""yes"", is ""si"" -- and every time Orlando says what should be ""si"" there is only the letter ""S"". Just too many sloppy mistakes in the editing.Overall, like the Nell Sweeney series, a fabulous and enjoyable light read."
5,Endearing characters and an exciting romance,"I have read all of Patricia Ryan's books available on the Kindle (both the medieval romances and Nell Sweeney mysteries), and have enjoyed every one. She has a talent for describing just the right sensual details in building up romantic suspense... in combination with a suspenseful and interesting plot. The Sun and the Moon, along with Heaven's Fire, are my two favorites among the romance novels."
3,So so sequel!,"The Sun and The Moon is the sequel to Silken Threads. Unfortunately though, it's not near as good. It features Hugh, the brother of ST heroine, and Phillipa, the former fiance of ST hero. They embark on an espionage mission to try to uncover possible treachery by Eleanor of Aquitaine against King Henry. Of course, they fall in love during the mission. By the end of the novel while Phillipa is whispering sweet nothings into Hugh's ear, all I could think about is how if it were me, I'd be smacking him upside his head instead!It's got some interesting tidbits about medieval alchemy, some intrigue, and references to Eleanor's...umm...rather ""liberal"" romantic court. All in all it wasn't too bad but it wasn't too good either. Doesn't even come close to the brilliance of Silken Threads!"
3,Not as good as Silken Threads,"I read 'The Sun and the Moon' immediately after finishing it's prequel, 'Silken Threads', and --although it was not a bad read-- I didn't like it as well. While I did identify somewhat with the heroine, a book-smart-but-sheltered and not as socially intelligent young woman, and found the ending touching and sweet, I didn't like the characters in this one as much as other books I've read. There was also a little too much deviant sexual behavior for my taste, even though it occurred between supporting characters. Over all, the plot is not bad, and it's hard to pick out anything major I disliked, it just wasn't for me.If this is the first book you've read by this author, don't give up yet. Try 'Heaven's Fire' (my fav. so far) or 'Silken Threads'."
4,"Not the best Mahler, but great Berlioz","While Mitropoulos' Köln M3 is truly great, his Köln M6 is not the best. Get the New York M6 instead. Now that is a performance which is nothing short of amazing. The New York performances included on this double album are great, though. Mitropoulos' Romeo et Juliette is one of my favourite Berlioz recordings, along with Boulez' Symphonie Fantastique."
3,Impassioned conductor/Uneven results/Poor sonics,"While I'm glad I own this disc and like the series from which it comes, I suppose I'm a dissenting voice amongst the universal praise for these recordings. The Mahler is passionate but the WDR Sinfonieorchester of Cologne can barely keep up with the conductor. The recordings with the NY Philharmonic are less sloppy but tend toward a rushed, overblown style with wild dynamic leaps and explosions that the poorly mastered mono sound can barely handle.Trying to be openminded, I'm left feeling that Mitropoulos was probably a conductor best heard live. As for being a ""Great Conductor of the 20th Century""? Well, the competition from Furtwangler, Walter, Beecham, Szell, Reiner, Bernstein, Ancerl, Klemperer and a few other heavyweights looks pretty tough."
4,Product as described,"everything is as described. overall quality is okay, but it's a bit hard to shoot - considering it's only a toy though, it's an alright deal.the only problem is that since it is fiberglass, little pieces of fiberglass will get under your skin, so i recommend wrapping the bow in tape before use"
2,Fiberglass= slivers,"my 4 year old son has wanted this boy and arrow for awhile we finally bought it at a toy store and the first time he used it, the fiberglass from the bow got into his fingers. We have now covered the bow with tape so he can continue to play with it."
4,Great quality!,"This is a wonderful notebook. Great quality paper and binding. The lines on the paper are a bit light, but I like that about it. This is now the 2nd one I have bought because I enjoy them so much."
5,Works fine,"I bought this to wire a sub on the other side of a room with a drop tile ceiling. Had I known that the wall plates that do this use coax behind and then RCA on the face I would have done it that way but this method did the job. I just had to find some RCA to RCA couplers to go though the wall plate,"
3,"Eh.. works, but smaller than hoped","I've had my eye on this type of pool float for a while. I finally took the plunge and purchased this one in the hopes of floating down the lazy river at the MGM Grand in Vegas. The vendor didn't have this style in stock so they sent blue one instead. I was bummed, but had been looking for this to be in stock for a while.When I received the raft, it was much smaller than I expected and found it hard to get two adults in comfortably. It quickly made it's way to the patio and stayed there for a while until I made a trip to the Salvation Army. My wife and I enjoyed the lazy river on two separate innertubes as usual."
1,"The ""Interior design"" in the title misleading",I expected to design new details in my existing interior but this program is useless in this respect. The program basically does visualization of the floor plan of given layout if one wants such a function. The photo editor could be very use full but the design of the editing interface is annoying and not workable. The available details are not to attractive and the learning curve is steep indeed compare with effect desired.No files of examples of interior design submited in the software (although used extensively in the product advertising's.
3,Software is cumbersome to use,"Software has a lot of features but is fairly cumbersome to use. The library of objects is limiting. Changing the color scheme is difficult when trying to match an existing color. I thought it a lot of money for the functionality. It may be more appropriate to someone constructing from scratch than for a redesign. Examples of things I found challenging include a step up kitchen, a custom wall unit, and a custom staircase to a second floor loft. Punch realized this difficulty with their product and sent out a training course for another chunk of $$. I didn't purchase the course because I thought I had already invested enough $$ and perhaps it would have helped. If I were Punch I would have sent the course out for free to encourage greater use of the product."
1,Very difficult to use,"No clear Tutorial for this super complex software. Program looks like it can do a lot, but the un-intuitive interface and poorly written manual forced me to give up in frustration even though I usually get along well with most applications."
2,"I love Jr, but this was not one of the best videos they have put out","I love Jr. but not this video. I ordered this video anticipating there would be behind the scenes footage, interviews and other extras. There is not. It is a video of the race and the victory lane interview and that is it. I was very disappointed becasue his videos are usually very good."
4,Interesting read,"This is a very plain worded book, and interesting as a read for anyone, psychology majors or not. It is very up-to-date on information from all the related latest studies, and provided a good perspective into the motives with which we live our lives. Highly suggest as a read for anyone interested in human psychology."
5,Memoirs of a Pornographic Film Director,"Bruce LaBruce's witty revulsion and response to gay culture--the film industry, drag queens, drugs, and sex--give his latest endeavor a certain pop-philosophical conversational appeal. LaBruce frames the creation of his films around a nostalgia for the old punk underworld of homosexual rebellion. In fact, LaBruce finds contemporary homosexuality almost criminal and desperately claims to detach himself from it. But LaBruce is armed to the hilt with a wicked tongue and a definitive sense of purity in his perversity. He may detest the fine art of homosexuality, but he impressively recounts his own grand history of gay ponderings and encounters. His incessant search for queer identity through his art leaves the reader wanting desperately to help him out, or at least give him a hand, and his chatty style makes the reader look forward to his promised sequel. LaBruce is definitely worthy of his artistic license and creativity."
4,Handy Dandy Tool,"It's a great dongle to keep around when you need an ethernet connection. It's too bad you still have to keep the driver disk around as the drivers are not built into Windows.Operation couldn't be simpler and also works with Vista.It wouldn't bridge in VMWare, but you can still use it with Virtual Server."
2,TRENDnet USB Gigabit Ethernet Adaptor,TRENDnet USB to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter TU2-ETGDisappointed with this itemCould not use with Windows 7 ProDrivers are not compatible for the Gigabit PortAdaptor works at 100 Megabits Per Second speed only no 1000 Megabits Per Second
5,Ethernet Adapter,I hook this adapter up and didn't need the drivers that came with it. I'm using WINDOWS 7 Premium. It loaded up and was using it with 3 minutes.
2,Mac users beware,"Mac users beware -- this adaptor requires Windows-only drivers. The Linksys USB Ethernet adaptor is not as fast, but it works flawlessly right out of the box, no additional software:[...]Note to TRENDnet: ""PC"" is not a platform."
2,Gigabit USB ethernet adapter,"Item was purchased to use with new MacBook Air, so gigabit was key in its selection. It arrived intact and well packed, and when connected to the MacBook, the computer sensed it, but it would not ever work. I called Trenenet tech service, and they seemed to know nothing. After about forty minutes' discussion with a number of agents, the gist was that the item is NOT Mac compatible, even though it says on its label that it is. I sent the thing back and bought the Apple item for that purpose."
1,Awful!,"I bought two of these, one for my Macbook Air, one for my wife's Acer Aspire S3, hoping to speed up backups at home and to use on a business trip in a hotel that didn't have wifi.On the S3 (running Windows 7) it was a disaster: The driver blue-screened constantly, and it was anything but speedy. We made sure we had the latest driver from the manufacturer's website.On the Macbook, it didn't work. OS X Lion recognized the dongle as a USB network device, but couldn't negotiate a network address, and when I hard-coded that, it dropped packets like crazy and was basically useless.So, in short, I wouldn't bother."
5,Muddy Waters Anthology,"This was purchased as a gift for a fiend who ""loves"" Muddy Waters. She was thrilled with this collection and said it was the best!"
4,Roy Ayers 'Destination Motherland'...,"I found this two CD set to be an unexpected suprise! Most of the material I was already familiar with since I owned the albums on Wax. However, the song ""Memory"" has stuck with me! A most enjoyable collection - I recommend it for those who are not Familiar with Roy Ayers. A very broad sweep of the work he had done at Polydor Records in the 70's!"
3,Fun 3 1/2 stars,"Not many black folks lived in Denver. Of the ones that did, they all seemed to know each other somehow. They were relatives, past lovers, past spouses, or thinking of becoming lovers. Amelia Benson knew more about them than they would ever have believed. For that reason, she was killed and more would die.Billiemae had not killed Amelia. But the police sure wanted to point the finger at her. Pharaoh had been trying to help her find out who really did it and why. He was also trying to help out Maris, who was married to an abusive husband.Rick, the husband, knew of the past between Maris and Pharaoh. When Maris had enough of the beatings, she left Rick. Rick had too much falling apart around him and Maris's leaving caused his sanity to snap!*** A suspense filled murder mystery that will draw its readers into its twisted plot and keep them on the edge of their seats! I am hoping for a sequel! ***"
5,Alberta - Sweet & Hot!,"I think seeing Alberta Hunter at the Cookery changed my perception of what REAL entertainers do in front of an audience. Not only was she the shimmying blues queen of the 20's, but she was also an international chanteuse and jazz singer without equal. Since Sony / Columbia is being so stingy about releasing on CD her great later recordings, this live performance is truly a Godsend. What a thrill to relive her artistry! During performance, Alberta would yell out to the musicians ""Lay it on me!"". Lay this one on yourself and relish one of the greatest cabaret performers of the 20th Century! This is hot stuff..."
5,"Perfect for dry, sensitive skin - no parabens","This cream is awesome. I used to get patches of dry, scaly, itchy skin on my shins in the winter time. For years, I used cortisone creams to tame the inflammation. When ""Intensive Care"" lotions came out in the 70's, I just 'knew' they would help me, but the fragrances, parabens, and alcohol made my skin even more inflamed. Some years ago, I tried Moisturel because it was a) the most expensive cream on the shelf (so it had to be good!), b) it was fragrance- and paraben-free. Since I found this cream, I have not had to use any prescription steroid creams - EVER. In fact, I don't even *get* that itchy rash any more, except a small patch in winter sometimes, that goes away with Moisturel. I couldn't be more pleased with this product... except I wish I could find it locally."
5,"I LOVED THIS PRODUCT! In the wintertime, I ...","I LOVED THIS PRODUCT! In the wintertime, I always have an extremely difficult time with dry skin. My hands get cracked and almost bleed without my constant attention. But with Moisturel, my skin was soft and supple. The day that I received the product, one hand was so dry and cracked that I could barely apply any type of lotion because it burned my raw skin. The Moisturel came and I tried it and -- no burning! It was very soothing and comforting on my skin. Since using this product, my skin has regained its natural elasticity and softness! Again, it's an excellent product and I highly recommend it to anyone who has dry skin problems."
2,ezcema cream,I bought this cream because it was recommended by my 4 month old daughter's dermatologist for her atopic dermatitis. It didn't really help her skin. It only made it feel really oily. I do use the cream on her scalp. It seems to keep her hair moisturized.
4,Boppy pillows are great!,"I loved this as a nursing pillow and it also helped for tummy time and floor time, however, our son never played with the rings while they were attached to the pillow. He liked the rings when he could hold them up with both hands. So, I give the Boppy, itself, 2 tumbs up, however, I could have saved a few pennies by just getting a regular cover."
5,Finally! The Second Album On CD.....,I bought this compliation for the inclusion of the second album(which was never available on CD in this country.
2,Not Useful,"I bought this book thinking I could learn some traditional effects stuff that I could use in my own ultra-low budget movies - like how to light a blue screen, do those water cloud fx, pyro stuff, etc... - but there is almost nothing I could use. I could find more useful stuff briefly surfing the net.A lot of the traditional compositing stuff is outdated because of digital, which wasn't really addressed. A lot of it is too equipment specific, not bothering to clearly explain stuff.Maybe it's good if you just want to marvel at how complicated fx can get, but if you're looking for stuff you can apply, look elsewhere."
3,Anodized finish wore off,"I have had only Calphalon Commercial cookware for nearly 10 years. This stock pot is my workhorse, but the interior finish is completely worn off. Since it's lifetime warranty, I am now sending it to the factory for replacement. I rate the pan only 3 stars because the finish is gone; if the company stands behind the product as they say they do, don't let the 3 stars deter you in purchasing this product. My other pots are all fine, but do not get the use this one gets (simmering tomato and other sauces for long periods)."
1,Outdated for Event Planners of the New Millennium!,"If you are not a professional event organizer planning a non-official function, this book may be of some use to you. However, I found the book a disappointment due to the fact that most of the material including context, venue layout, theme concepts, designs, and especially the photos (mostly in black & white) very outdated. These material would have been useful in the early 80s. Definitely not worth the price it is charging."
2,Dated & disappointing!,"Warning to potential buyers of this book...it's pretty expensive for what you get - have to say I expected a gorgeous hard cover and lots of glossy pics but it is NOT like that. Whilst the cover is hard, there is minimal coloured pics. All in all, whilst this book has good ideas I was generally disappointed."
4,Book was slightly disappointing. Seller was great.,This book would be a great book except for the fact that the author only managed to make half of it in color. A good portion of this book is filled with pictures. Please note that I did receive it in the condition expected and in a timely manner from the seller.
2,Dint get the results as promised,"this acne treatment works very good on skin, makes your skin smoother and helps fight dryness, but didnt work on acne, not at all...."
2,"Disappointed, for sure.","It's a good thing that this product is discontinued. Neutrogena was smart to replace it with something better-New Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Stress Control 3-In-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment - 2 ozGet this instead! It smells much better, cheaper, and actually works!"
2,"Very nice looking, but quality is lacking!","I purchased this iron for my wife about 7 months ago. The reputation of the company has always been the outstanding. This iron was supposed to be their Best and Most Expensive. Based upon prior experience with a much less expensive iron made by Rowenta, I immediately decided to purchase their best for my wife. I am sorry to say that the iron has not stood up to low usage. My wife and I no longer have children living at home. Our last iron was still working after more than 10 years. I guess nothing is made the way it used to be. I am extremely disappointed with the quality of this iron. I have returned it directly to the Rowenta Service center,after making several telephone calls. I hope they will send us a new replacement quickly. I can't imagine they would try to repair it. I will keep Amazon posted!"
1,"Leaks, and worse - rust stains on shirts","Very poor construction, leaks badly and when using the steam function often drips rusty, dirty water onto shirts. Very expensive defect. Very unhappy, and thought i was buying the best."
1,Leaking water after very little use,"I was astounded by this iron when I first used it: clouds of steam, heaviness made quick work of wrinkles. Even though it is a very expensive iron, at first it seemed completely worth the price tag. However, after just a few years and not much use, the iron is leaking out of the bottom--not what you expect from very expensive, seemingly high-quality German engineering. I would not buy another Rowenta. Also, the iron is an energy hog. If ironing at night, all of the lights dim down when the iron is on."
1,DEFECTIVE 3 TIMES...DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!,"I was looking for a high quality iron when a friend told me that Rowenta made the best. I bought the Advancer iron brought it home and the auto-shut off would not work. I took the iron back and got a second iron and it would not even heat up so against my better judgement, I took it back and got a third Advancer. The iron worked wonderfully for about 2 months, now it leaks water everywhere. I contacted Rowenta and they said even though I had purchased 3 bad irons in as many months there were not going to give me my money back under no circumstances. They would however replace it. I DONT WANT IT! They even had the incident numbers as proof that I had problems with the first two. DO NOT BUY THIS IRON!"
1,two faulty irons in 3 months,"I have purchased 2 of these irons since October, 2006. The one I received in October worked until about 1 week ago. I purchased a second one, and received it yesterday. I plugged it in, and the LCD started flashing alternately between the red and yellow lights which indicates an electronic problem. It wouldn't even get hot. This is SO disappointing. I have used Rowenta irons successfully in the past, and purchased this one based on the reviews. I don't know if I am just getting ""lemons"". Both companies will refund my money, however, I am going to have to do new research. I assumed any iron above $100.00 that was designated ""professional"" would do just what it says. Think long and hard about taking a risk with this one!"
2,Great iron until today,"I purchased this iron along with the Rowenta ironing board 15 months ago and pretty much have used them weekly since. Everything has been great until today. Like a review left just a day before, my iron over heated today and started flashing red. I unplugged it and used it while it was cooling down. I plugged it back in later and it doesn't work any longer. I will call Rowenta to see if they will service it under warranty, but with a 12 month warranty I doubt they will honor it. So, if not, how much will it cost? I expected a ""professional"" $100+ iron to last a little longer than this."
1,Ditto on failure,I was loving this iron as well until three days ago when I got the magic redlight and the iron got hotter and hotter and nothing. Will be sending this iron for servicing. Hopefully it won't cost a lot.2nd rowenta iron I haven't been happy with.
1,THE WORST IRON!!!!!!,"THIS IS THE WORST IRON I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. I ALSO BOUGHT A SECOND ONE THINKING THE ELECTRICAL PROBLEM WAS A FLUKE BUT IT IS NOT. WILL NOT HEAT UP AFTER 4 MONTHS OF USE AND THE AUTO CUTOFF QUIT WORKING 2ND MONTH. BEWARE, THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AWFUL."
3,Looking for quality,"This iron is heavy for an iron. It takes some arm strength to iron with it. My wife said ""I'll get used to it....."". Previously we had a mid size Rowenta and the steam unit in that model broke within a year. Very disappointed but thought I'd try them one more time."
3,Great steam. Small water reservoir.,"With 400 steam jets and continuous steam setting, I expected less time needed to iron. No saved ironing time, in fact, more time needed as the water reservoir at the continuous steam setting needs to be refilled after each article of clothing, e.g., 60/40 blend man's dress shirt, pair of Docker's khakis. Too much hype about Rowenta, undoubtedly made by those embarrased by the ridiculous price they paid for an average iron."
1,DO NOT BUY - iron died in less than 6 months!,"This was a great iron, until it DIED less than 6 months after purchase! No smoking, no burning fabric, it just stopped working!"
1,Rowenta Has Problems,"Under the delusion that Rowenta is one of the best steam irons, I purchased yet another one. When it works, it's great but there is a flaw that is pervasive with Rowenta irons. The 'auto off' feature turns the iron off in the middle of ironing and shuts the iron down! The steady red 'on' light, blinks rapidly, the iron stops working. The iron has to be unplugged, cooled off and replugged. It will work for a couple more minutes, then the process has to be repeated.Choose another steam iron!"
1,"do not buy the ROWENTA ADVANCER IRON, it's junk","I purchased this iron about a year ago, paid over $100.00. IT'S OFFAL, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. The water runs out, I used tap water, as that's what the instruction in the booklet told me. The water runs out and it's dirty. The heat never get hot, where then you iron the linens are left with wrinkles. No matter how many time I go over them back and forth."
1,Water tank leaks!,"This is a great iron if you don't need the steam, but after a year, the water tank will begin to leak when it is shut off and set on it's heel. Haven't used distilled water."
2,Iron Pyrite - fool's gold,"We got this Rowenta iron in March, 2009, to replace one that had worked well for about 8 years or more. Like so many reviewers, at first we were very impressed with it. It worked fine and did a fine job. Now, understand there are just my wife and I, and we don't do a lot of ironing - maybe one morning a month covers it. Here we are, just over two years of use, and it flat died. It simply doesn't heat. Rowenta was little help, saying it was likely a thermostat, and could be repaired at a service center. How much? Minimum $35 with no guarantee. Thanks, but we'll try a $35, brand new, Sunbeam.Rowenta? Bad choice. Expensive paperweight."
1,Piece of Carp!,Had this iron a little over a year. Paid too much money for it. Then it stopped working after 1X PER month use. I figure I paid 7-10$ per use for this piece of CARP! DO NOT BUY!!! STAY AWAY. ROWENTA WILL NOT MAKE GOOD ON REPAIRS OR CLAIMS.
1,The WORST Iron I have ever owned,"Nov. 2, 2009: Update, my iron is dead and not worth the money spent!!! It started leaking water everywhere. I tried everything to fix it, nothing worked. I would NEVER buy this product again."
1,Never Worked,"I purchased this iron believing everything it advertised, however, it never worked from the second I opened the box. I was forced to return it and had to pay a re-stocking fee. Be careful!"
2,Sorry,This is our second dz 9080 both quit working.We like the iron so much that I sent my wife to buy another and she call me to inform me that the store quit selling them so told her I would look on line. To my surprise I came across many people having problems with this iron and thatThe maker isn't to helpful. So I am not buyingAnother dz 9080 . We need to stick together!
3,Wife loves it...BUT,"This model does the best job of any my wife has used. But the Rowentas in this price range appear to have a design flaw.Be forewarned by the 'Troubleshooting' issue in the manual: ""Yellow and Red LED are blinking alternately"".The first iron lasted almost three years before it's blinking death. But she liked the iron's performance. The replacement, with a fancier/better sole plate (and about $20.00 costlier), blinked/died in one week.Amazon did a superb job of fast, free replacement under warranty. If it weren't for the warranty, we would have switched brands. The price demands reliability.Relative humidity here is usually over 70%. High enough to cause fluorescent shop light fixtures with electronic ballasts to fail regularly, sometimes right out of the box. Maybe Rowenta's electronics don't like it either? Simple design fix, methinks."
2,Keep you old iron handy,"I have the iron for four months now, it is a beautiful iron from its appearance, but what is inside the iron itself is anybody's guess, I would give this iron a five star, it really is a wonderful iron when fully functional, but likely than not, it will be problematic later, I iron one dress shirt per day, and with such light task, the iron would not hold up. I am ready to send the iron to the warranty center for repair for the SECOND time in only four months of ownership, yes, this is not a typo, the same burning smoke came out of the iron, and the heat was lost, became dysfunctional, I contacted the Rowenta customer service, I was surprised to find out taht the person who answered my call had never heard of such problem from other customers. anyway, I suggest to new potential customer to keep your spare iron, even if you are buying this one, good luck."
1,WARNING!! Leaks like a Sieve,"I feel like I have two ears and a tail because despite that my last Rowenta leaked, I was convinced to buy this outrageously expensive product which has quickly become another defective piece of Rowenta-made junk. This is not a matter of using the iron improperly or a problem with the water. I've always used city tap water in it. The water leaks right out of the bottom of the iron! And I'm not talking about a few drops here and there. I'm talking about large amounts of water that leave large water marks. It literally drips/runs out the bottom of the iron (the heel, not the sole plate). No, it's never been dropped or damaged in any way. Of course this happened right after my warranty ran out. This company is now on my no-buy list. I will never, ever again buy another Rowenta anything after having wasted so much money on their irons already."
2,Doesn't last!,"I am very disillusioned with the concept buying a high end iron, especially a Rowenta iron. It just quit heating completely and suddenly within only 2 years of purchase. I was very pleased with the steaming ability of this iron and expected, at this over $100 price point, it would last a very long time. My cheap Black and Decker iron is still going strong after 10+ years! Of course, there is no local repair facilitiy in the Sacramento area. The nearest Rowenta repair facility in in the San Francsico Bay area. My calls to Rowenta consumer ""Service"" were unsatisfying. All they would do is send me a $15 gift certificate for toward the purchase of a new Rowenta iron!! Why would I continue to be a Rowenta customer???"
1,Fire hazard!,"Works great until it catches fire! I used mine for nearly two years with no problems, then it started smoking after being turned on for about 45 minutes. I unplugged it immediately and took it outside. It continued smoking for at least 10 minutes. Now the soleplate is separated from the base. This iron is too dangerous! I'm going back to my $20 Black and Decker."
1,Rowenta DZ9080 Advancer,"I have purchased 2 Rowenta DZ 9080 irons within the past year. Iwas optimistic that the first was a lemon, and I wouldn't get burned again (sorry for the play on words). NEVER again!! Both were pieces of junk, and fizzled out within 3 months.The Rowenta people should be ashamed for unleashing such a shoddy product on the world. Both had exactly the same problem: They worked well for a month or two, then shorted out/burned internally, and died a miserable death. Phone calls/e-mails to the Rowenta people went unanswered. In German, the word ""Rowenta"" means ""lousy customer service"". DON'T BUY Rowenta!! It's nothing but overpriced garbage."
3,Great Product But Doesn't Work,I purchased this iron and very promptly recieved it. I plugged it in and it worked great and I loved it problem being it only worked for 1 hour. I'm in the process of getting Amazon to replace the iron as I still want this product. I've never returned anything to Amazon before and without the ability to talk to someone we will see if this system works. Having made many purchases from Amazon and being very happy I hope I'm not sorry to have purchased this product this way. I know when the new one arrives I will be very satisfied with it as long as it works. In the meantime I had to purchase a cheap iron to tide me over. This added to the cost. No deals on this purchase I guess.
1,BAD IRON,Very bad iron burned my shirt and darkened the ironing boarddid not heat I did not even use it muchI had to throw it out I paid a hundred dollars for this Pleasedo not buy this iron
1,Unreliable,"This iron is less than a year old, don't remember the exact purchase date, and it doesn't heat up at all now. Just quit working."
1,BROKEN AFTER VERY LITTLE USE,"I had this iron for 2 years, but I hardly ever used it. It looks brand new. In fact, the last time I used it was about a year ago. When I plugged it in to use it, the red auto shut off light just kept blinking. It heats up a little, but doesn't stay hot. I've tried to plug it into different outlets, and it does the same thing. This is a real bummer since it was so expensive and I got little use out of it."
3,Its a great iron but not worth the price,"This is probably the finest consumer level iron you will ever use.However, compared to irons that cost around $50 its hardly any different. There is no way that ironing clothes justifies the additional money to buy this.Ours lasted about as long as all the other irons we've owned, then died. Less than two years.Though its the best iron I ever used, I give it 3 stars because its not worth the money.Lesson learned! I'll go back to paying $30 to $50 for irons again."
1,Avoid thi sproduct,"Read the poor reviews - those of us who have owned this product for more than a year.It leaks, scalds, and spots clothes. Not the 'gold standard' you would expect for such an expensive product."
2,Great until it dies.,"This iron performed really well, right until it died at almost three years old.It works well, until it doesn't work anymore. Like others have mentioned, itoverheats and burns itself out. For $130, you'd expect it to last longer,but we decided to replace it with a more affordable model. I can't recommendit after the relatively light use we put it through in the time we had it."
2,6 months and dead,"I have had this iron for approximately 6 months. This iron may be one of the best that I have used.However, my iron no longer heats up and is now rendered useless (besides for a paperweight or water gun) and I don't have the receipt for the warranty (who would of thought?). Needless to say, I won't be buying a Rowenta again."
2,Big Budget Consumable,"Parent company in France has strange Gallic customer service concepts (arrogance) for a competitive world.Irons well - with a little shoulder ache at the end of the day if you don't position the ironing board height well as it is so heavy.Prone to dropping dead. No sense of good will customer service. Customer service - wrong word, wrong rules. Pleaseant (frustrated) Americans have to provide service according to French Rules. Checking around with friends who buy the best - all have same experience. Unit breaks shortly after warranty of 1 year finished - need another one as service cost rivals new iron. Trying a T-fal before I do this a fourth time."
2,Most expensive iron lasts less than a year,"I quilt and actually like to iron. I bought the Rowenta Dz9080 Advancer iron for the steam factor and doing broad ironing on flat fabrics. A couple of months into use some plastic piece related to the burst of steam flew off. Never did get it back on, but it didn't seem to stop the steam, and I was able to continue to use. Now, about a year later, I'm working on a project and it suddenly overheats, I can smell it burning. I turn it off and now when I turn it on, the lights come on, but it doesn't heat. Don't buy this product if you think that price is an indicator of quality. It's a heavy iron,, had a nice nose design for getting into tight places, but let's face it. I had less than 100 hours on the iron and it is now a giant paper weight. Totally not worth it."
1,All the glitters,"When I bought the Black and Decker 2030 based on recommendations on this site, I was hoping that it would perform better than my 17 year old Norelco 725 steam iron which required that I spray the garment with water before ironing to get a good press. But when I compared the two (with the both on the highest steam setting), making a single slow pass over a linen shirt, the Norelco actually did better! The B&D burst of steam was impressive, but it wasn't enough to remove the wrinkles on its own. The B&D has its steam holes around the perimeter, leading me to try out the Rowenta DZ9080 which has them distributed more evenly. It has a larger plate and looks great. But using the same test, the Rowenta was the poorest performer. The Rowenta did have the best, finest, water spray. But like the B&D's, the Rowenta spray points straight ahead; you have to lift and tilt the iron down to spray the item, which then causes an unnecessary burst of steam."
2,Stopped working after a year,"Same as with many other reviews for this product: it worked fine until one day it stopped heating up. Now it stays warm all the time regardless of temperature settings. There is nothing visibly wrong, it did not fall or anything, but it's not working."
2,Liked while the iron was Hot,"This iron has an outstanding 400 hole steam plate! The Rowenta DZ9080 irons out wrinkles in cotton like nothing I have ever seen before. However, the water runs out after ironing one shirt and a pair of slacks because it emits so much steam. It is a big cumbersome iron, a bit awkward to handle. The water tank is difficult to turn over and empty as instructed after ironing.The heating unit suddenly went out before the warranty expired. The company replaced my Rowenta DZ9080 Advancer with a new Rowenta DW9080 Steamium free-of-charge in June 2010."
2,Great while it lasted,"For two years this was the best iron I've ever owned, great steam and even heat. All was great until one day while ironing it kept getting hotter and hotter until it started to burn my shirt. I quickly unplugged it, cleaned the base to remove the melted shirt and let it cool down.Plugged it in the next day and while the lights all worked, nothing else did. Stuck with a $100 dead iron.Darn shame it didn't last longer, as it ends up the iron cost about $4 per month to use."
2,dies after overheating,"Worked well for a while (used once a week or less)One fine day, it started overheating, burnt the dress, and diedNot good for an expensive iron"
1,Ex-Rowenta Fan,"For almost 2 years, I would have rated this iron 5-stars, but last night it malfunctioned terribly. It began with flashing lights, then overheated until the plastic control knob fell off! I have my old Rowenta cordless to fall back on as I was in the middle of a big project, but it leaks if filled too much and doesn't get very hot. Rowenta, I don't know how you got such a good reputation. It would not be worth trying to send it back."
1,The Worst,"I should have listened to the other reviews. This iron and all the other Rowenta irons I have owned do NOT live up to the claims. I do a large quantity of sewing and quilting and I wanted a good, professional quality iron. This iron is the worst iron I have ever owned. A cheap drug store iron is better. It leaks, not just drips, LEAKS, a ton of water when it is just sitting there. Sometimes I find it sitting in a literal puddle of water on my ironing board. When ironing, it spits water constantly, and seems to know just when to leak on something I'm being particularly careful with. Spending more than 100.00 on an iron should result in a usable product. The customer service is terrible and who wants to keep sending an iron in the mail? I will never buy another Rowenta anything!"
2,"Great Iron, POOR workmanship.","I got this iron about a year ago, and I have only used it 7-8 times. It is by far the best iron I have ever used to get wrinkles out. The only problem is the quality. On my last use, the plastic heat control knob broke off. You would expect a 100+ dollar iron to have better workmanship, or a better warranty (1 year). Rowenta clearly needs to fix some issues in their factories."
2,BEST Iron that doesn't last,"I purchased this Iron about 8 months ago. I must say I thought this was THE BEST IRON EVER. The large water fill hole was enought to make me fall in love, but the steam was GREAT and easily controlled. The sole plate is wonderful, it glides over all fabrics. However, I was just thinking the other night what a gret iron this was, as I watched my wife ironing away... then I took over and after about 2 shirts I noticed the iron getting hotter and then the there was a electrical burn smell and the red light started blinking. I unplugged it and ironed another 5 minutes on the stored up heat. When I plugged it back in it never got hot again. Unfortunately this is the same thing that happend to my last Rowenta, however, this was after about 5-6 years so I was OK spending a fortune on this iron. It's under warranty, but I still need to go buy another iron while this is being fixed or whatever. It's sad when a product this good has poor quality and doesn't last."
2,love the features but auto shut off didn't work,"I loved all the features of this iron, especially the incredible ammount of steam and multiple steam holes in the soleplate BUT the automatic shut off feature, which is the main reason I picked this model, did not work at all so I had to send it back. Also this iron, while very balanced is pretty heavy if you do a lot of ironing."
1,Used it 4 times and then it broke,"I bought this iron because I wanted an iron that produced a lot of steam. I settled on this iron. I use an iron infrequently but when I do, I want it to work very well, so I was willing to spend the extra money. I paid around $125 for this iron. I used it four times and it worked well. The last time I plugged it in, it started smelling like an electrical fire and then quit heating up. Now it does not heat up at all. After reading other reviews here, it appears that this is a common problem with this iron. Rather than go through the expense and aggravation of trying to get it repaired, I'm going to throw it away and buy a good old fashioned Sunbeam or GE iron. I have an old Sunbeam that has worked dependably for 15 years. I can't recommend this Rowenta iron to anyone."
5,rowenta dz9080 advancer iron,"Never thought I'd spend over $100 for an iron, but I do a lot of sewing and this was a great investment. The micro steam vents give it great output and it evens steams great held in the vertical position. Highly recommend it though the price is above the lower end irons, but if you want a true performer, this is it."
1,Fahrfrömwerken!,"I was thrilled when I got this iron. German engineering in a household gadget! It's heavy, it steamed flawlessly (I didn't have the leakage issues other reviewers had), and was the iron of my dreams (if there can be such a thing). I adored this iron. I updated my social media page about this iron. And then two days ago, it broke my heart. I plugged it in, noticed a somewhat disconcerting electrical smell, and the little green light never came on. It just died. No warning, no brave last days, no nothing. And had I registered it for warranty purposes? Of course not! Who registers an iron (even an expensive one)? I have no recourse and no iron. Curse you, Rowenta!"
2,Loved it but disapointed broke to fast,Being German and having had great succsess with my Miele vaccum cleaner I bougth this Rowenta iron since it was made in Germany. It ironed great loved the steam the nice work it did. But it leaked water when we forgot to emty the water tank. Now after 1 1/2 yrs. it suddenly won't heat anymore.And calling Rowenta they don't even make the parts for this iron anymore. I think for the price over 100$ it should have lasted longer than that. Maybe Miele sells irons.
1,"Horrible Customer Service, Sent in Twice for Service within one year",This iron simply is a hazard. I have had it serviced twice with the latest issues being the sole plate coming apart from the base of the iron. I can't explain how dangerous this is!! Rowenta should take note as someone may get hurt. I strongly suggest anyone considering this iron look else where. I have had Rowenta irons in the past that were outstanding; this one is simply a disaster and should be taken off the market.
1,Fried,"After about 1 year , iron overheated, auto shutoff did not work and it would not heat up again. Don't waste your money on this"
1,Worst Iron Ever,"I bought this iron back in Jun 2008 even after reading all of the negative reviews. Now I completely regret my decision! It simply quit working yesterday while ironing! The light is on but the griddle is cold as ice. I even took out the manual and re-read from cover to cover to try all possible trouble shouting suggestions. Nothing worked. I can only guess that it is stuck in auto-shut mode. The key question is how an iron can go on auto-shut mode while ironing??? I am at a loss for words. Naturally, the warranty is still good, but it requires sending the iron to their service center (at my cost of course) and waiting 2-4 weeks for an answer. This might not be an issue for most people, but I actually iron several times a week. So basically, I will need to replace the iron at my cost anyhow. Do yourself a favor and buy another iron."
1,Best Iron with Quality Control Problem,"I loved this iron and it was/is the best iron I have ever used. Unfortunately, there are serious quality control problem with this iron. The first one over heat and put burn mark on my shirt after 3 months of used. Got a replacemeent from the store I got it from and every thing was fine for about 4 months. Yesterday, the control knob fell out of the unit when my wife turned it off. I could not figure out how to put it back so I took it back to the store and get the DZ5080 instead. Hopefully, the DZ 5080 does not have similar QA problem."
5,Rowenta Advancer Iron,"After reading negative reviews, I almost sent my order back, but I am so glad I didn't. It is a awesome iron and I love using it. I love the Rowenta Irons!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS IRON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The first one I bought I had to send back, it was leaking water from the bottom of the iron. Got a replacement, has work great up until about 10 days ago, this one is now POURING water from the botton! Rowenta has a one year warrenty. Mine was up July 1st! So I'm stuck with a $100.00 steam iron that will not steam! I will never buy a rowenta iron again, and will tell everyone I know not to buy one!"
5,Rowenta DZ9080,"This iron is excellent on all counts. It's easy to use, although a bit heavy. I love the generous steam it provides plus the pointy nose which gets into every seam and corner."
2,Rowenta Advancer Iron unreliable,Rowenta DZ9080 Advancer Iron we found to be unreliable. Did not work properly. it keeps cycling on and off when trying to iron clothes. Requested a replacement. Hope it works better.
5,EXCELLENT!!!,"This is the most versatile and powerful iron that I have ever owned. I purchased it at my local Bed, Bath, and Beyond , and I am very satisfied with its performance. As Rowenta and previous reviews say , the crease removal is flawless (very important for a person of my profession), and it also puts creases in very well. Overall, another great product by Rowenta."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Just Bought this item today , tryed to fill water and noticed water leakage.... Reaturned !! very disappoinment after spending big $$$ on this item. Also built quality is very chip,iron base plastic is loose."
2,Good while it lasts...,"No need to share the good parts. Just confirming what others already mentioned - dies after 2.5 years of infrequent (at most once a week) use. Wanted to find out why it leaks so much, then stops leaking for a few weeks altogether. Opened up the back: it's all plastic, just cheap plastic from Germany. That's how they get you! The platinum treated stainless steel plate makes it very good, and they know it. They also know that you want (or should I say need) to buy a new one every two years. It's called modern economics."
1,Leaks like a sieve,"Heavy, but did a good job ironing until it developed a leak. I don't know why it started because the iron has never been dropped, but the entire contents of the water tank will drip out of the bottom in about an hour. Useless now. Save your money and skip this piece of German engineering."
1,Avoid this like a plague,"This was our second Rowenta purchase. The first one (DZ 5080) was leaking water from the handle, so we decided to buy this Advancer model. It was ironing good, but again leaked water from the base, not the sole plate, after 6 months. Then after an year it fails to heat up for about 30 minutes, sometimes not at all. We paid $160 with discount at Macy's for this iron. We are going to buy a Black & Decker or Panasonic. It may look nice, but believe me, its life is only 1 year. You can buy Rowent irons if you are willing to buy an iron every year, that is the durability of Rowenta products. Sadly, I realized this after spending $230 on two irons."
1,*P*O*S* - DO NOT BUY,"I bought this iron b/c Rowenta is supposed to be a reputable brand - gold standard of irons. However, I no longer think this is true and now feel foolish for spending so much money on an iron.I had my last iron for 10 years, I remember it was the cheapest iron on the market and never had a problem other than a little leaking - BUT AT LEAST IT ALWAYS WORKED. What attracted me to this iron was all of the features : anti-leak, super steam (I never had to dampen the fabric!), fabric settings.etc. This iron is is supposed to be anti-leak - it started leaking after just a few uses. Pulled it out to do some ironing today - smelled like it was burning and then NO STEAM! I let it sit for a while to cool off - now it doesn't even heat up! I haven't even had this iron for 2 years. What a waste of time! My day is now wasted! I will never spend more than $20 bucks on an iron again.I'm not even going to bother having it repaired after reading some of the customer service complaints."
1,A waste of time and money$$,"I love a good iron, and I gave Rowenta three chances to live up to their publicized high standards. HA!! The last Rowenta I bought ran correctly for less then two weeks before malfunctioning and then completely quitting on me! The company's customer service does not exist--More like customer DISservice. Do yourself a favor and give up on Rowenta! Don't waste all that money on a CRAPPY iron."
4,very good,"I have been using black and decker regular iron for 10 years. This is very good iron.Haven't used all the features yet, but very fast to iron in the morning...Recommended."
2,Not sure,"I bought this because I have rosacea. It seemed to make it a little worse. My daughter put it on and her face broke out requiring steroid cream but I'm not sure if it was from that or she had an allergic reaction to a food. Either way, I'm hesistant to continue use of it."
3,If you are looking for a cheap product...,"My overall experience I have with Neutrogena products is pretty good. This Oil-Free Lotion moistruzies my skin and especially I like ""pump"" type of the container since it's easy to use.But this moistruzier is nothing beyond average. It's a reasonable price, good for daily uses. and also this one doesn't have SPF, so persons like me who is looking for day cream without SPF, is good to go!But I do not recommend this product for those who has dry-skin type. As well, if you have an acne-prone skin, this will not going to imrpove your skin condition."
2,I hate it,"I usually use Mary Kay moisturizer which I am usually happy with but not all the time. Well in a money pinch and needing some moisturizer I bought this Neutrogena. I have hated it since day one. That was last winter. Not sure why I keep using it. I guess it's all I have right now and keep forgetting to buy something else. For me it's heavy, greasy and makes my face itch. I've tried putting it on when my face is still damp right after a shower hoping it won't be as heavy, nah. Tried wetting my hand then applying then it don't work at all. Will be looking for something different."
2,"For the sensitive, fair asian skin","I tried this product out for a couple months and my conclusion is: 2/5. My skin is pretty fair and is pretty sensitive to any harsh chemicals or exposures. This only left my skin drier after putting it on. I would try to layer on more but was still left with dry skin. :( I'm not saying that this product won't work for anyone, but for me personally it did nothing. Just my two cents."
1,Absolutely Terrible,I've been using this for about a week and my face has become a disaster zone.My skin is now red and blotchy from a reaction to the moisturizer itself and it's caused a breakout.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin. It's complete shit.
2,"excuse me, i can't find the date for using it",can u tell me where i can find it?most of the product should have the using date.why i can't find it???
1,Not for very sensitive skin,"This one is not good for the extra sensitive skin, the other one is. Neutrogena has several ones for sensitive skin, I tried all of them and here are the reviews:1. Sensitive with SPF burns2. Sensitive with the ""black rectangle"" on the bottle, breaks out my skin3. Sensitive with purple and blue rectangle on the bottle is perfect.[ASIN:B001ECQ3A4 Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, Sensitive Skin, 4 Ounces (Pack of 2)hope this help!"
1,"Not alcohol free, not for sensitive skin.","This moisturizer is advertised as being ""free of drying alcohol.""...yet alcohol is listed among the ingredients.I only bought this because it said it was oil and alcohol free- as both ingredients cause me to break out, and really irritate my skin. After using it for about a week (with rather unpleasant results) I finally read the label. Neutrogena makes some decent products, but I've been seeing this advertised as alcohol-free all over the place, and I'm legitimately angry about it. What a load.Some people can use moisturizers with alcohol and have no problems, so I understand that this may work fine for some people. But advertising it as alcohol-free is really frustrating for those of us who can't. I wouldn't have thought they would tell a blatant lie right on the box, yet they did. Change the product description please!"
2,Not so good,"Neutrogena products are (usually) good, but this is not one of those. Ironically it does exactly what it says it doesn't. Even though it's oil-free it leaves greasy feeling on the skin and it makes the skin very shiny. It also caused breakouts on my skin. I give it 2 stars because, despite making your skin quite messy, at the end of the day - it does moisturize."
2,Not useful for people with experience,"This book offers no real insight for people who have been involved in the life cycle of either enterprise / ""shrink wrapped"" software. The book primarily deals with issues that would be common knowledge to most people who have worked in these roles for even a short period of time. It might have been better if the author had included real life scenarios of product management failures / successes and provided some sort of ""analysis"". Since this book provides neither depth nor breadth, I would classify this book as an utter disappointment."
1,"Not much writing, large font and little value","For whatever reason, the makers of this book felt the need to use a pretty large font, and lots of margin space. Reading 20 pages took no time at all and I think I finished the whole book in perhaps 1 hr. The contents were pretty much common sense, nothing terribly useful beyond confirming my thinking about being a PM before buying this book."
2,Pretty bad,"The book is just a bunch of rambling by the author. Ever so often he has a good point, but you could count those good points with less than 10 of your fingers.Towards the end he gets into technical platforms. In my opinion, it was useless information.Don't let the number of pages fool you into thinking it is very in-depth. The type is fairly large and double-spaced. This sneaky tactic is best left to college term papers."
2,Not worth the money,"I just bought this book recently. This book talks about many general concepts, but I didn't see many useful points."
5,"Quality, USA-made drills","I was looking for a set of drills for my Proxxon FF 230 micro mill/drill, and this set is perfect. With a small milling machine, there often isn't a lot of vertical clearance, and jobber-length drills in the larger sizes are simply too long. With screw-machine-length drills, I can usually establish a reference with my edge/center finder and then immediately insert the correct drill without changing the table-to-spindle distance.These drills are sharp and run true. I've bought a few Chinese drill sets lately, and while you may be able to pick up a 115-piece set for less than $50, good luck drilling metal with them and having the hole be round and close to the desired size."
2,Good photography but little factual detail,"A well presented book with a wide variety of photographs making it a good source of ideas for interior designers. Beyond that there is little to commend it. Most of the pictures are not referenced, even those of grand or unique designs of fireplace. The commentary is lacking in technical and historical detail and the organisation into historical periods is only loosely adhered to. Not a bad coffee table book but not much good if you want information on designing, building or choosing a fireplace."
3,"Good enough to read, but not to salivate over","The Wyrm isn’t really anything original, and nothing that Laws did with it was that unique, but it still managed to keep up an interesting string of events.The atmosphere was dark enough to serve its purpose for a horror novel, I enjoyed the characters, the pace was steady overall, and the ending was dynamic. The “fight” itself lasted awhile and then abruptly exploded.While not an award winner, The Wyrm is a book worth hunting down. It tells the story of an ancient creature letting loose its havoc on a small town, killing and terrorizing many. The Wyrm speaks of pure evil, and, while done with a one-dimensional touch, manages to entertain after all."
3,Starts out BORING but picks up after page 99,IF you have this book or see it on the shelf in your local book store I would recommend picking it up for a read during a plane or bus trip. But start reading the book at page 99 since the first 98 pages are charater development and sort of drags along as you are introduced to all the 'main' charaters and how the secondary charaters view and see them. The story picks up on page 100 when the Gibbet is FINALLY unearthed from the ground. Then the action and the storyline goes from slow and boring to a faster and interesting pace.
3,ok...but super colossal smash hits of the 90s was better,"This album does contain my favorite Maverick's song, Dance the Night Away, but why would they release another greatest hits album only a year and a half after their last one? Super Colossal Smash Hits of the 90's included 12 tracks, not just 10 and was an even better all around album. If you are a die-hard Maverick's fan, get this album, but if you want a good introduction to their awesome sound, try the Super Colossal Smash Hits of the 90s cd."
2,Do not buy this CD,"The Mavericks have the good fortune of having one of the best, most original singers around. Although he shines throughout this album there is one inexcusable flaw: editing. The catchy (if not exactly deep) ""All you ever do is bring me down"" has a accordian solo by Flaco Jimenez, which, for some bizzare and unknown reason is edited out of the version on this record. This makes this record unlistenable. Buy the original."
3,This is part of 3 CD set (Disc 2),"This is not the way to purchase this music. 10 tracks and runs just 24:04 minutes. If you're going to buy, get the full 3 disc set.Typical California Beach/Surfer music. Note, The Fantastic Baggys track 'Tell 'Em I'm Surfin' sounds just like The Beach Boys! They (Beach Boys) did record this track around the same time also.The music itself is pretty good stuff though.enjoy.."
4,Great,The wall mount works just fine. Does exactly what I needed it to do. I am recommending it to everyone looking for a mount.
4,Works with a few issues,"I bought this for a 50"" plasma and after a bit of work, it certainly holds up the TV just fine. It's a bit stressful to have that large of a TV on a rotating stand like this but it seems to be up to the task. So that's a big plus.However, the lower bar on this mount blocked all the HDMI ports on my tv so I have to plug in my devices on the front panel plugs... not pretty. Additionally, one of the four screws needed to mount this to studs snapped in half when I was screwing it into the wall. I put in another smaller screw but that was disconcerting.It is a very sturdy mount except for the screw issue and seems to hold up the TV just fine. Decent."
3,more challenging than expected to mount,"I know now why this was 1/2 off. It took over three hours to mount on the wall. It also required a trip to the hardware store to purchase a grinder as the holes did not match up and we were unable to line it up. Luckily the people mounting it were able to line up the holes once the hole was ground. Once the television was mounted it was not level, but it wasn't because the wall mount was not level. It was because the people mounting it did not know there was a balancing knob. (They may not be the sharpest tools in the shed, but they did figure out how to ""fix"" it.) Had they known about the balance knob they probably would not have needed the grinder. Would I recommend this? Probably not. More difficult to mount than expected."
5,best,This is a very funny book. The train keeps your little was listening. I am happy that I got this book. It is great as a gift or for any little boy. I let my baby cousin hear this book & he loves it.
3,Its Okay,"My son who is now 2 doesn't really have an interest in books. We are still trying and I thought a train book might help. Not so much. Its not a bad book by any means, it just doesn't keep his attention."
5,Awesome,"This CD is awesome. We just got it a few days ago and my kids have listened to it over and over. I also like it. It is fun! My 5 year old daughter loves to dance to it. I've caught my 7 year old son moving his Star Wars ""lifesaver"" sword to the rhythm. The lyrics are great. You gotta have this! This is the best ever Children's CD."
5,A Captivating and Practical Book,"Mr. Ulasien took a very practical and applicable view point of a hot topic among Corporate America workers today. Not only did the title catch my attention, but the book totally captivated me. It was obvious that the author spent many hours researching the evolution of Corporate America, and how the rat race came to be. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about his and others' experiences, and I personally related to several scenarios. This is must read book!"
4,Rat race review,"Paul did an excellent job in breaking down the corporate challenges facing today's worker in an easy to understand format. The author's use of examples and real world scenarios made it easy for the reader to relate and gave you a feeling of being there. Having come from corporate America I now have a better understanding of the ""why"" things have become as they are. I have recommended this book to friends and co-workers and it has been well received. Looking forward to his next book."
4,Quirky but lovable,"This is a charmer of a book about several topics few of us know or thinks much about. If you are a lover of music, travel, or tales of the deep South, you'll find this a pleasant read. by an author who speaks with a gentle but clear voice."
2,Not a Great Book,"This book is heavy with self-promotion and devoted to convincing the reader that only a patent attorney can perform the magic. This is reinforced by touching on issues in an incomplete way and saying ""this is too hard for you, so ask your patent attorney."" Also the organization is not great - it jumps around a bit and contradicts itself in at least one place (whether a provisional patent should have a claim). ""Patent it Yourself"" and other books are better."
1,No luck,I tried it out but got no good results. It also made me break out which was not good.would not recommend
4,A little goes a long way,"Based on the fact that I'm currently using several anti-aging products, I'm not certain which are helping and which aren't, so I can't comment on the anti-aging claims of this product.However, I will say this: the product goes on without a greasy feeling and makeup is easily applied over it. Also, ""a little dab'll do ya"". Goes a long way."
2,Not for acne prone skin,"This left my skin feeling just oily and gross...not to mention, I broke out worse than I have in over a year! I used it everyday just short of a month (you bet, I returned it!) and I thought maybe it was a fluke, but within a week of quitting usage my face cleared back up again. Maybe it's great for some types of skin, but obviously not good for oily or even combo skin."
2,Other options may be better,"I purchased this to lighted age spots on the back of my hands and forehead. This product contains 6% Octinoxate to obtain SPF 15 and 1% Enzulzole for bleaching. I saw improvement for the first month, then lightening stagnated. Johnson and Johnson Ambi uses 2% Octinoxate for sunscreen and 2% Hydroquinone for bleaching. This was able to restart the bleaching process. I currently use the Neutrogena product in the morning to take advantage of the greater sunscreen and the Ambi at night. Bleaching continues after three months. Exposure to sun will reverse the bleaching and should be avoided."
3,Box is broken!,"This product is really awesome, I like it! I'm using it everyday or I've been using it for more than a year. I can recommend this product 100% to my friends, but problem is the packaging it is very bad."
3,I liked the smell and feel of it ...,"I liked the smell and feel of it when it was applied. I was a little careful as I am very fairskinned and allergic to a number of things, but this product didn't seem to bother my skin. I would recommend it to my family and friends and plan on continuing to use it."
2,not nonvinced,"I have been using everyday for a month now.I was so positive after reviewing all the positive reviews. May help reduce blemishes, but I still had some. Saw no wrinkle reduction. And irritated eye wrinkles, a burning sensation. I'm only 41 so I thought it would plump up the wrinkles. I would not buy this again. And I would not recommend this to anyone. I was really bummed that my pores had NO reduction."
1,Too greasy!,"I purchased this and the matching night cream because it was recommended to me. The day cream (with the spf) makes my face so greasy. I don't have oily skin, but my forehead looks like an oil slick after using this. I tried using less but it didn't make a difference. The only redeeming quality of this is the UV protection, and that is rather low at spf15. I'll never buy this again."
5,am i crazy or do i already see results?,"Just two weeks after using this I honestly think my skin is smoother. I'm 28 and am using it preventatively but my face definitely looks tauter and dewier than with my normal cetaphil moisturizer. Also the texture of the lotion and how well it absorbs into the skin is fantastic. I'd heard retinols make your face worse before it gets better, but so far no redness or breakouts anything like that (I use the recommended amount-a pearl sized portion.)"
4,It applies smoothly,"I have use this product for three weeks. I like the way it feels when applied. I keep looking in the mirror for ""less wrinkles"". I do not know if it is working the way it is advertised. I'll let you know later. In the meantime, I will continue to use it."
3,3 1/2 - Pretty Solid But Unspectacular,"I'd never seen or heard Sunny Ledfurd before this CD arrived. I'd say they're a pretty good band - mostly rock with a dose of rap. Not many bands can combine these sounds successfully, but these guys manage to pull it off fairly well. In my opinion, they achieve a decent balance, and it works for me. It won't make my regular rotation, but I'll throw it on again sometime."
5,Ventures are Still Great !,"I bought this album, not knowing anything about it. It turns out to be one of the best Ventures' Albums I had ever heard !I love their new interpretations of these songs, esp. Hawaii 5-O ! *(I am very sorry that I came upon this album so long after it's release.)"
1,Poor construction,"We purchased this swing based on some recommendations [...]. When it arrived, I was stunned by the poor quality of the item. The metal bars for the frame have pre-drilled holes in them into which you screw machine screws for the feet. Two of these holes were drilled too large and the screws weren't able to bite. The bars at the top are curved, and onto each bar snaps a ""mobile"" for over the top of the baby. These bars were not curved equally, so the mobile wouldn't snap on snugly and popped off every time the swing was turned on. The instruction booklet was also poorly written, but thankfully the assembly was fairly straightforward. I would recommend shopping around, and if you're set on this swing, check it out in person if possible. I was very disappointed so we returned it. Good luck!"
5,Great Swing!,"This swing has been great to us. Might I also add that it has survived 9 months each from two children. In the beginning I was disappointed because it uses batteries, but let me just say that it does not drain the batteries unless you are using all the features all the time. We have had a few ""accidents"" in it as well and the seat cover disassembles easily to wash in the washer. The only thing that was useless about this swing was the head pillow it came with; it was constantly sliding around. We ended up putting a car seat head support in and it worked great. Another great thing about this swing is that the seat comes off to make a bouncer. This is great for little babies that are eating food (our babies were too small for high chairs in the beginning and the bouncer worked great for feeding baby food). The assembly is easy and straight-forward, there is really no reason for it to be a problem for anyone unless they can't read."
2,It's OK.,"My baby loves his swing and the detatchable bouncer seat (which I admit is really convenient). But the batteries don't last long at all and the buttons that control power and speed, etc. have to be pushed several times before they work. Overall, it's been more of a frustration than anything."
4,Good products for cleaning ears,"I purchased this on the recommendation of our vet. These are non-stinging and do a great job at soothing my dog's itchy ears. She's Cockapoo, so she has floppy, hairy ears. They often have problems and she spends a good deal of time scratching her ears. Every couple of weeks I use the drops to get rid of whatever's in there and she loves it."
3,"Calphalon is good, but for Casseroles, buy Creuset","I'm a big fan of Calpahlon equiptment for skillets and sauce pans, but when it comes to Dutch ovens and casseroles they do not even compare with Creuset. Conducts heat perfectly, well-balanced and very easly to clean. They are also indestructable, whereas Calphalon requires that you be relatively gentle -- this comes in handy when you have to clean post-baking. I inheirited one of these pots and then bought another. Since then I have excused all similar imitations from the kitchen.I recommend the 3.5 QT Creuset 'French Oven' as a great all purpose piece (I know, it's really a Dutch over but those French are so proud). If I had to equipt my kitchen with 3 cooking pots/pans, this would come right after the skillet and sauce pan."
5,excellent choice,"I had been looking for a good non-stick cooking vessel for a long time till I bought this one.I love it, it's the best I've bought so far. I use it daily for all my cooking. It's suitable for a family of four, is very easy to clean and looks good too.The only drawback is the handles get hot after a while of cooking."
1,Too little info,you can;t expect to pass or maybe barely pass on this info.Too shallow and uniformative. A waste of money
1,this book is so hollow and shallow,The format of this book should be like BRS Pathology or Behavial Science which show concise but comprehensive. Joel's book is thick but hollow and shallow. A medical student or resident can pick up more important stuff from textbook than he does.
3,For Reference Only,"This is an OK book with good compacted information if you don't feel like lugging your Harrisons or Cecils with you when you go out to study. I would not recommend this as your sole source of info for Step 3 prep, but as a supplement for when your mind short circuits on common diseases and treatments. I studied mostly from Kaplan live lecture notes, did questions from Swansons Family Practice review, and when I wanted just a little bit more information about a certain disease, I would use this book to look it up. Buy it used if you can."
1,Outdated,"The field of visual information retrieval has changed remarkably in the past 6 years since this book came out. Even this book when it appeared was somewhat lightweight. I could only recommend this book to computational systems historians, not to any students or researchers.When will there be a real textbook for this important area?"
5,Karleen Nazaria review...,I liked this book because it's amazing and funny.And the elves and reindeers are so cute and extraordinary...... Nicholas Martin is trying to be a mature boy but he is not. It's so amazing and cool...... 'Ü'THIS BOOK ROCKS!!!!!!!-KARLEEN NIEVAÜ''
1,awful,"Why would anyone want pots that can't be used on high heat, can't be washed in the dishwasher or can't be scoured for fear of removing their anodized finish. My Calphalon professional pots were very expensive and it makes me sick that they have preformed so poorly.I am a real cook and use my pots several times a day, I need them to work, not just look good and this cookware is ridiculously tempermental. After leaving them on the heat too long, just once, they warp. Food sticks easily to them and they are very hard to clean because you can't use steelwool or abrasive pads. After a guest put one in a dishwasher by mistake, the pot finish was ruined, and I had aluminum coming off on my food. I am someone who takes good care of my things, and it is impossible to clean these well without removing the finish. I had taken some comfort in the ""lifetime"" warantee, I tried to return them, but the warantee, like this cookware is absolutely useless!"
3,Finish flaked,"I loved this pot until the finish began flaking. To be fair it was after 2 year of use, but I baby my pots and would have expected it to last much longer."
1,Disappointed,I have owned a 12 qt. Calphalon Stockpotfor many years. I grow my own tomatoes yearlyand it has served me well. I decided I neededan additional pot to cut my time in the kitchenand increase my volume of canned tomatoes.My original pot is from Ohio and is a sturdywell balanced pot. The new one is sadly not madein the USA and a slimmer lightweight version ofit's former pot. They are similar in color butthat is where it ends. When you are stirring heavypots of hot food you want stability & this pot doesnot give me the confindence I am used to for Calphalon.I guess my old favorite made in America company hasfailed me this time.
2,Just doesn't last,"I bought and have used several pieces in Calphalon's hard anodized line, including an 8 qt stock pot, a 6 qt stock pot, an everyday pan, a 12 qt pot, and a saute pan. Initially I was thrilled with them - great solid pots and pans at a great price. The ones I've had *are* well-made pans. I've used them every day for more than 10 years. That said, the hard anodized coating just hasn't lasted. I find that when I've made applesauce or tomato sauce from my garden produce, or a tomato-ey soup, a little of the hard anodized surface is etched away until the plain aluminum underneath (nice and shiny) starts to show through. Now I don't know about you, but I'd prefer to keep metals like aluminum (hard anodized or not) out of my food. When I noticed the hard anodized layer disappearing on my pots through normal use, I started moving to stainless cookware one piece at a time. Yes, it's more expensive to get heavy-duty quality, but I'm hoping I won't have to buy new cookware again in 10 years."
4,Calphalon Stock Pot,"Very good price for stockpot this size with cover. Could be a littel thicker on bottom, but otherwise excellent. Material is easy to clean and much lighter than stainless steel or even some aluminum pots I have used."
3,de-anodized on 3rd batch of sauce....HOWEVER,"I am a very happy owner of way too many pieces of Calphalon, hard anodized and stainless. This pot has a good weight (not too heavy), small enough base to fit on a standard burner and still get a pan on the burner in front, if needed. The 3rd batch of home grown tomato sauce took about a 4"" circle of anodizing off on the bottom.Spoke with customer service at Calphalon, and as it happed SO quickly, they are sending a post paid return. AND, since this is discontinued...it will be replaced with a 12 qt. contemporary stainless (can you spell dishwasher?) So, folks, at the amazing Friday price - for a little inconvenience I'll have a great stock pot for next season!Other cooks have not reported this outcome, so I do think it's a bad batch from China, but they absolutely stand by their warranty.So, yes, buyer beware - -but, if you're paying attention here....there's no way to lose. These are great products at a fabulous Amazon price."
5,Stockpot 12 quart,It is a very good item when you need a large pot to make soup or cook noodles for a large meal. Don't know how I was able to function without it.
2,calphalon D812 commercial 12-quart stockpot,I used this pot 3 times to make apple butter and the finish came off.Calphalon will replace it with a stainless steel pot. I have had great luck with my other calphalon hard anodized pots.
2,QUALITY Issues,"This Pot is heavily & deeply grooved inside which translates to a quick & dirty finishing/polishing job on the part of Calphalon. You can feel the grooves with your fingers easily and it is as if the company did not fully smooth it out.I own several Hard-Ano pans from Calphalon and all are nearly mirror smooth in surface, not this one.This pot is huge and inexpensive..39.99 -w- free shipping.But I feel again disappointed to see that Calphalon has decided to undermine their own Brand Name and quality integrity.Calphalon used to make great cookware, but not in these new China made, low end models.I think i will keep this as i do not plan on using it too often, it is more a ""special use"" pot. And for the money it is OK.But if you are using the stock pot often and see it as an integral part of your kitchen I strongly encourage you to get something else like All-Clad...MC2."
4,Slow shipping!!!,"Great product, but from where do you ship? It took almost 3 weeks for me to get it."
4,Love Calphalon,"Though I have yet to use this stockpot, I did purchase it at a good price and had always wanted this size. I have had and purchased Calphalon for many years and I can say that there is a marked difference in the product from the pans that I bought years ago, so I do wonder about the quality. Hard Anodized if used correctly can be one of the best metals to use in cooking. Read the directions and follow them and you will love this as much as I do. This is my most recent purchase so all my other Calphalon is much older and still in great condition. If this product doesn't hold up in the same fashion I will update this review, but as of now I'm a Calphalon FAN!! Thanks Amazon for the grat prices. PS the best time to buy the Calphalon is on their Friday sale day!"
1,NOT DISHWASHER SAFE!!!!,What top of the line product is not dishwasher safe. I didn't realize the anodized coating would WIPE off after repeated cleanings in the dishwasher. After less than six months it looks like a piece of junk.
2,Not what I had ordered,"Hi yal, This was my first experience with amazon. The product is NOT what it says it is. Whether it is a knockoff or just not commercial grade, it's not what i expected. I am willing to see if the exchange will be what they advertise, though. To give the benefit of the doubt. Interesting, several days after I placed the original order, I shared with a friend what I had found. And she had informed me that her experience with amazon ie ebay, you don't always get what is being pictured and advertised. So we'll wait and see what the exchange product is like and let you know."
4,calphalon stock pot,This is a good deep stockpot large enough for the home cook's needs (though I did have to size down a recipe for some stock to fit it in the pot). Easy to clean and light to carry too.
4,big tall pot,"This is a great item at the discount price. It's a big pot for lots of pasta, stew or chili. Used it several times in the few weeks we have had it. Good quality. No problems. Kind of tall on the stove for a short cook. Lid fits well."
4,No leakage thus far,"From looking at the other reviews I've seen for this product, it has a tendency to leak around the handles. So far, mine hasn't had that problem and is working like a charm. I give four stars simply because while I don't have any major complaints, there's nothing particularly spectacular about it either. It's a stockpot; odds are pretty good that if you're looking for one, this will work for you."
5,Nice!!,This stockpot is exactly what we needed. Cleans well and easy. You may want to watch the heat a bit as it holds the heat very well and you can burn food or have food stick. We could spaghetti sauce for 24 hours in this pot and had no sticking problems (on the 2nd batch). The first batch stuck a bit as we were not used to a pot that holds the heat this well. We have been using high quality stainless steel in the past but this pot is really nice.
3,Made in China,"I was a bit disappointed in the quality of this stockpot. I have the 8 quart version, which was made in Ohio, and am very happy with it. This stockpot is made in China, and is noticeably lower quality. It's not bad for the price, but it's probably not the deal you're hoping it is."
4,pot for canning,"I bought this pot for canning (I make my own salsa - up to 100 qts) as I got tired of using my 6 & 8 qt pots at the same time. I've got over 30 calphalon pots/pans and although I prefer the quality of their products when they were made in Toledo, Ohio (several years ago), this is of similar quality of their ""made in china line""."
4,Great pot,This pot is great. I love to use it to make tomato sauce for the gang. We have our sit down on Sunday and love the spaghetti and meatballs. This pot makes my job easier. Cabeesh?
4,caphalon pot,"caphalon stopped carrying the old style professional and my daughter wanted the 12 qt stock pot. it was only available at your site, ordered and arrived in 3 days and the price was great!"
5,"Great Pot, Great Price!","I just received my pot today. I was quite pleased! I thought it would be a lot smaller, but it is quite large; the price was just FANTASTIC considering this is a quality piece of cookware! I have used Calphalon pots and pans for years...they last forever and always cook food evenly...A definite recommended buy!"
1,Only Calphalon One is made in US according to their customer service,"I was interested in these pieces at these prices but I do not want to products made in China when I can avoide it and so I called the 800 number for Calphalon and was told that only the ""One"" lines are made in Ohio. Everything else they make is produced overseas, including the copper pots and the cast iron."
3,Not such a great price,"I ordered this, swayed by the rave reviews and the much higher 'retail' price, but after it came in decided it may be just too big, my 8 or 9 quart, which is also much heavier weight, is really big enough. Now, as to the big-deal $40 price, it's not so great. People are selling them on eBay for as low as $5, new, and even with a steep shipping it's less than 40 w/ free shipping. Regret the purchase, too late now to send back. A gift, maybe?"
5,great stock pot...,"This a a great pot...plenty big, and excellent quality. My friend bought one too, as I liked it so much."
2,hosewife,Its not non stick as descriped. Even cook the soup and stuff stick to the wall very hard to clean.
5,Pot full of love!,"I love this Stockpot! Easy clean-up. Heats and cooks food well. I've used this for tamale meat, gumbo and other sauces. Great price.Fast delivery."
4,Large stock pot at very good price,"Calphalon Hard Anodized is amongst the best cookware out. Usually extremely expensive, I was very happy to get this 12-quart stockpot and such a good price."
3,Lid doesn't sit properly on pot,I bought the pot and found the lid is warped and doesn't sit on the pot properly. It was too late to try to return the item. Check right away if you do buy.
5,TERRIFIC STOCKPOT,I bought this pot to repalce my beat up stockpot and couldn't be more thrilled. The price was awesome with free shipping and it's the best stockpot I have ever owned. It will probably last me the rest of my life it is so sturdy.
5,Great Stockpot,"The Calphalon Stockpot is fantastic. It is the perfect size for making large amounts of soup, but not too large like the 20 quart sizes that you normally see. It heats up quickly and evenly and cleans up easily. I am now considering buying other Calphalon cookware and I would recommend this stockpot to anyone! The shipping was very fast and it was packaged well and secure."
1,Not traditional Calphalon quality - FAR from it!,"After reading handfuls of horrible reviews, I decided to gamble on the stockpot anyhow. No deal. The product that I received was terribly sub-par. I could have put the lid on a record player and received a tune for my efforts... the entire pot was corrugated, grooved and uneven, and had a 'wrong' feel to the metal composition. I called Calphalon to exchange it - which they were happy to do for a 'contemporary' version of the same product. It turns out that ""Commercial Hard Anodized"" is no longer a line that Calphalon produces - so your chance of getting one that is the original quality is pretty much zilch unless you've actually handled the product that you plan to purchase. Go for a different make or model instead."
1,going right back to amazon,do not buy this stockpot! just got it today and it's going back immediately. aside from other reviews concerning leaking from the handles this just looks like a crappy stockpot. when it was made in the u.s.a. i'm sure it was great but that is not the case anymore. it has noticable machine marks which makes the surface rough. the handles look real cheap too. don't let the so called sale price get you like it did me. this isn't worth $60 on sale and amazon shouldn't even sell it. really don't buy it.
3,Product quality has gone down hill,"My original case was purchased at Costco about 6 years ago but was recently damaged in a flood. I was pleased with the quality and finish and equally happy to see they were still made (Costco no longer offered) so grabbed one here.The exterior finish on the new one I would only rate as fair; being cherry you can see where the stain was wiped too soon before it was allowed to soak in - especially on the edges. The interior I will rate as poor. Largest problem is inconsistent drilling of the support holes; the second being uneven wood preparation and very poor finish.Sorry to see the quality erode on what was initially a great product I would give a solid 5. I should have sent it back for a replacement but knew it would be a hassle to repackage, take time off from work to wait for someone to pick up, and then repeat for a new one. I have no issues with the seller; it's just with whoever in China is churning these things out."
2,Leslie Dame Video Storage Cabinet,There were defects in this cabinet upon arrival including scratches/gouges on the bottom left side of the cabinet. It seemed apparent that these were factory defects as stain was over the gouges and scratches. I contacted the seller who then contacted the manufacturer. I was offered a partial refund to keep as is and elected this option. However when I subsequently went to set up the interior shelves discovered that 2 holes were either crooked or not fully drilled into the interior so also cannot use the add'l shelving or will need to have someone fix for me.
2,"Looks good, but upon closer inspection...","This Chinese made product is way overpriced. For what I paid I expected some quality. It looks nice, but the wood is very light and the shelves do not fit perfectly. The plastic studs which are supposed to hold the shelves are cheap and the holes are not even drilled to a uniform size. It also emits a strong odor at the moment.Some holes were too tight and I had to fight to get the studs in and others were too loose so I didn't want to put too much on those shelves. When it is closed it looks nice. I would put most of the stuff on the central area shelves and not too much in the doors which rest on swinging hinges. It would have been nice if they would have made this of a heavier duty wood. I don't know how long it will last. Its too bad we don't have country of origin labeling in the U.S. because I would go out of my way not to buy anything made in China."
5,Get this cabinet now!,"I was so fed up with all these cheap build-it yourself cabinets that would fall apart and the doors not open and close properly. It's not that I don't know how to build these cabinets, it's more that they give you cheap material and the holes that they drill never line up properly. Don't put yourself through that.After extensive research I found this cabinet, and it is a keeper for sure. Comes already assembled except for the shelves. Solid, firm construction. You can tell that this cabinet is going to last.I guess my review is going to be short because I can't really say anything negative about this cabinet. If you are looking for a solid DVD cabinet, this one is well worth the price."
5,"Perfect for boiling potatoes, small amounts of pasta, etc.","Calphalon Commercial hard anodized has the same durable surface as the Professional line, but with stay-cool handles and a better handle on the lid. I found this on a sale table at Marshall Field ... and have found that I often use it instead of my 8 quart stock pot. It's great for boiling potatoes, small quantities of pasta, poaching chicken breasts for use in other recipes, and many other common cooking tasks. I had never had a sauce pan larger than 3 1/2 quarts before, but can't imagine not having the 4 1/2 quart size now.While the interior is not non-stick, it's about as close as you can get, with a non-porous surface that easily cleans up. With no plastic knobs or handles, you can use this cookware in the oven as well. Excellent quality, and good balance and design."
5,Very Good Read,"This well-written little book is a real education in clarifying the relationship between England, Spain, and France during the Elizabethan period in England. It explains why Elizabeth finally lent reluctant English help to the Dutch and why the Spanish Armada planned to use what is now Holland to stage its attack on England. A lot of history was affected by this killing, which was the first time a ruling monarch had been killed by a hand gun."
3,Well researched,"Well researched book, however good the story might be, the author makes it more convoluted than necessary. She jumps back and forth making it hard to follow at times. Interesting bit of unknown history, makes it a worthwhile read."
3,"LackLuster, but...","I tried the Sensitvie Skin formula and I think I need to try the reg formula that has more AHA. The sensitive skin formula has about 4% AHA and the regular formula has about 8%. I noticed a difference in my skin, it was subtle but then later on, it seemed like the product stopped working. (I attribute this to it being a lighter formula, and I conclude now that my skin needs something more aggressive). Overall, for someone with sensitive skin, they may reap the full bebefits of this moisturizer but I didnt."
4,Great asset for every reader,This book confirms a lot about words. Straight to the point with personal examples to amplify the lesson. I have learnt to choose my words carefully. I would say this is a must read. You will not be disappointed. Enjoy the book.
5,Words,"Great teachingEvery person needs to read this book,yes even ChristiansA book you must read often and have with you to share with others"
5,This little book is a MUST!,Kenneth E. Hagin's teachings are extremely helpful in learning how to walk by faith and how to have a better understanding of the word of God. He makes it all so simple!!! This is a MUST for anyone serious about the Lord.
4,To let us know the power of words,"This will give one an underestanding that what is said has great powee to those who hear it, and it can help them along their way, or even destroy them. It teaches that it is so essential to give consideration to what you have to say in this life. Certainly a good book to read and learn."
3,Ranges from pretty groovy to absolute ick.,"""The Power of Goodbye"" was not initially one of my favorites from RAY OF LIGHT, but it grew on me as a single and now I really dig it, so I was interested to hear how other folks approached mixing one of her ballads. Dallas Austin (whom she worked with on BEDTIME STORIES) creates a really great alternate single version, and Fabien's more club-like mix is also interesting. HOWEVER, if I NEVER hear the Luke Slater Super Luper mix again, it won't be long enough. It's an absolutely annoying track that isn't really even a mix: the only recognizable elements from the original track are the words ""Freedom"" and ""comes"" repeated ENDLESSLY. Listen to that one only if you're into self torture, but the others are worth the cash if you're a Madge collector like myself."
3,Not very powerful goodbye.,"This cd single is very disappointing.The remixes are not at all interesting.There is a better remix of this song on the ""Ray of Light remixes"" cd.Buy it if you are a fan, otherwise don't bother.It's a shame, as the song itself is fantastic."
1,drawing on the artist within,there is a reason why you can buy this used for 6 cents... it is mediocre... her first book is authentic and really great... this is a characticure of that.
5,Excellent for more than just students!,"This is an excellent book. I originally bought it at the suggestion of my Drawing II instructor. Reading this book helped me understand how I could keep improving my art...not only with drawing, but in photography as well. The lessons can be applied to just about any project. I highly recommend this book to anyone."
1,A waste of time if you're an artist,"This book is more for corporate executive types who think 'being creative' is doodling on a notepad for 5 minutes. *Those* dudes need to explore their inner artist a little more, for sure. If you're in a creative block, or wanting to learn how to draw, there are much better resources out there to help you out. You really don't need this book, as it will be a waste of time and keep you from actually making art!Also, regarding the author: Betty Edwards seems to have over-analyzed the right-brain/left-brain system - something the left-brain would be in control of, according to her teachings. She was defeating her purpose by writing a book about the method, since people must experience, firsthand, the ecstasy of hitting 'the zone' when making something. Analyzing it and taking credit for such a natural gift from God is, to me, ridiculous."
2,used book for sure,"I'm nor surprised it's a book your artists friens want to read, this on has been used for sure!"
2,Book is so-so,"This book has some good information regarding different styles and techniques for drawing. The author is a little self absorbed throughout the book, and talks about herself and a class she teaches at a college. It goes fairly in depth on the thought process and workings of the brain.There are sections on drawing different emotions, once again using herself and her students as examples. I wouldn't really suggest that anyone buy or check out this book in a library unless there was absolutely nothing else that related to what they were looking for...that's why I got this book."
1,"IF YOU FIND THIS BOOK HELPFUL, YOU MUST NOT BE AN ARTIST!","NOT ONLY DOES THIS BOOK OVERLAP, I FOUND IT INSULTING TO READ! I WAS SO BORED OF THE DRAWINGS AND OVER AND OVER EXPLANATIONS OF THEM THAT I COULDN'T FINISH THE BOOK. THAT WAS TOO MUCH REALLY!! NO THEORY OR ANY BREAKTHROUGH KNOWLEDGE WHAT SO EVER."
3,Surely boring,Satire of a costly and no-where-to-take policy of abstince-only imposed on young people in the USA is the only real stuff hypocrisy of such a practice demonstrated worldwide already.Surely boring.
4,George W. Bush needs to see this movie,It's a great educational movie on how abstinance programs dont work. MTV has done a great job.
4,Egg Roll Night,I play this CD in my restaurant on Egg Roll night and its always a hit!A lot of music and a lot of fun atmosphere.
5,Excellent!,"As a college student at Brigham Young University, I have seen literally dozens upon dozens of international films, and this one ranks as near the very top--one of my favorites. Action-packed and hilarious! I have been searching for it for over 5 years. . . and finally found someone who can deliver."
4,One of Tsui Hark's best.,"Hollywood likes to think it can make films with strong female characters. However, more often than not, these characters are masculinised and far from sympathetic. Peking Opera Blues shows Hollywood how it should be done. Three strong roles for Brigitte Lin, Sally Yeh and Cherrie Chung and not at the expense of excellent male characters such as Mark Cheng's. Also, the feisty three retain all the charm and innocence that the Hollywood versions lack. Tsui Hark creates a visual treat for all film fans and manages to whip the audience into the frothy action. A superb mixture of action, comedy and drama."
5,Hong Kong film classic!,"A great film for any Hong Kong movie buff or newbie. How can you beat having three of Hong Kong's most beautiful leading ladies - Brigitte Lin, Cherie Chung, Sally Yeh in the same film? The Chinese opera scenes are beautifully costumed and shot. Tsui Hark is a genius!"
1,RHStore version has no English subtitles,"The Movie POB is one of the best (plot, direction, casting, acting)My dvd player has NEVER given me subtitle problems in viewing over 200 dvds. This Fortune Star produced disc from RHStore has Cantonese, Mandarin, and English subtitle selections, the first two work, the English subtitles show nothing. They did show on my computer, but this is a less than standard disc."
4,"This book was created for the ""newbie"" Astrologer.","This book was created for the person who says ""I want to know more about Astrology."" It is well writen in easy to understand language unlike other Astrology books. Its a great beginner book and most likely a great addition to the ""intermediate"" Astrologer."
4,Beautiful music !,Very nice guitar playing of Villa-Lobos compositions. But the real star is the last track: Sexteto Místico: wonderful version !
4,Really does help with the white dust,"I wish I didn't have to use these, but the area I live in has the hardest water I've ever encountered. Even with a water softener the minerals remain and create a huge amount of white dust without these. Worth it if you live in an area with hard water and don't want to spend a fortune on bottled water."
5,Honeywell demineralization cartridge 2 pack for humidifier,The product came in very good time and seems to fit the humidifier for a lot less money than buying from Honeywell over the phone.
3,works,"this product does what it's supposed to do , however they need replacing more than the recomendation. the price here was the cheapest anywhere."
2,Good,"This to me was a modern version of a old movie, the directors had the chance to create a much better ending. At least this actor did not use drugs."
4,Good remake of a classic,Good remake of classic car flick probably more a little more viewable to a larger general audience than the original but that doesn't mean its a better movie.Film sticks to the basic original storyline but throws a few other elements into the flick eg. sick pregnant wife and FBI in the chase as well to add a little extra to the movie.The car is awesome gotta love the 70 R/T Challenger with a 426ci Hemi
3,Vanishing Point Revisited,"Well, it wasn't as good as the original (they never are). First of all, they completely changed the storyline by making ole Kowalski out to be some sort of domestic terrorist trying to get home to his pregnant wife. If that wasn't bad enough, they totally screwed up the ole man in the desert (lots of beans) and put a bikini on the naked chick on the dirt bike. The only good change was the addition of the Charger police car, though they could have made that part of the chase last longer. Overall, it's worth a video rental. If nothing else, you get to see a good ole MOPAR tearing it up!"
3,The made for tv version,I originally saw this on tv when it first aired. It was more suited for tv viewing than dvd. I haven't watched it again after the first time. The original version is a better bet.
3,vanishin point,I had no problem getting the movie. But I had to send it back. It froze up on me and wouldn't play to the end. I cleaned it but discovered that it had a bad scratch on it. They got it back and said it was fine and made me feel like i was trying to gyp them . I love this movie and want it really bad but if it won't play no sense in keeping it. I still want the movie and hope to get it and ad it to my Viggo Mortensen collection. Thank you.
1,one star is still over rated,"Watch a Disney movie instead, you will more than likely find that more sensible and exciting than this waste of film."
1,Please Don't Waste Your Time With This Version,"Words cannot describe how badly this version stinks. There is virtually no connection to the original masterpiece. Negative Stars!!!!!! They should be ashamed of themselves for putting the title ""Vanishing Point"" on this utter piece of garbage."
3,VP1 vs VP2,"VP1 is an absolute classic of a movie. It has everything, screenplay, cinematography, casting, acting, directing. VP2 isn't bad at all, and the scenery is just super, but it doesn't hold a candle to the original. I saw VP2 on Cinemax. I own VP1 on DVD...AWESOME! 3i9."
1,"i have never seen source movies like the original""vanishing point"" raped and spoiled this bad before","how can you take the best drive-in movie ever made and turn out this WEAK AND POINTLESS remake that robs the story of all the best parts.maybe it was because they gave to much of his background or maybe it's because they give him a good reason for the chase(wife about to have a baby). in the original he starts the whole thing over a $10.00 bet and nothing more(that we know), so with some of the mystery gone most of the tension is gone also. really a miss step by all involved"
1,how could they,stick with first one and not this movie which has one of worst cases of sunshine and lollipop endings ever
2,Drive Past It,Not a very well done film. It might be worth a rental but please check out the original version of Vanishing Point. It blows the doors off this one.
2,Not really,"VP1 was an astonishingly good representation of the impact of the 1960's on the next decade...it had a great car and a good cast; great soundtrack and good scenery as well as a ""feel"" for what a lot of the USA and its inhabitants were like (low budget so it used a lot of real people and locales). Kowalski had tried the straight and narrow and then the crooked and lowdown. He had failed (not always his fault and did have some successes...medal of honor ,e.g.)at each...had suffered the loss of his love,so, all that was left was death.VP2 has the Dodge Challenger R/T and a vapid, inane plot. What a waste of a great repro/rebuilt classic muscle car! Get VP1 and see if,even after 35 years, it does not hold up..."
3,Remake review,"For the hard core car movie enthusiast this re-make will not satisfy. The original is a classic genre film along the same line as ""White Line Fever"", ""Dirty Mary Crazy Larry"", ""Duel"" ""Two Lane Blacktop"" and ""Sugarland Express"" to name a few.However, viewed as a made for TV movie (which it was airing on Fox) it is reasonable entertainment. The scene with the police officer using his own personal 68 Charger with a ""Starsky and Hutch"" light chasing our hero in his Hemi Challenger alone makes it worth watching.Mike"
5,Vanshing point,Great movie but couldn't figure out what happened to Viggo at the end. Did he die or live?
1,Wrong video,I did not receive the correct video from The Used Book Hounds. This company will not exchange the incorrect product.
5,"For anyone dealing with past trauma / post traumatic stress, Napier's books are must reads...","I can't recommend Nancy Napier's books enough. They have become a staple for me in terms of my own recovery the past 10 years. She addresses dissociation as well as DID, but her focus is primarily post-traumatic stress. My only wish is that her books would be available via Kindle..."
3,Sacred Practices,"I was disappointed in the first chapter when the author concentrated on the shadow part of the personality. I think this should be done in psychotherapy, and doesn't help a person to concentrate on being happy. I was turned off by the exercises and the meditations, but this is only my opinion. Other people in my group seem to like Napier's approach."
4,Very good book - would not mind more on finance,Very good book. However the math prerequisite is at quite a high level. Especially the probability theory introduction could be a little less fast-paced. As my main interest was on the financial application I would not have minded a little more on that topic and a little less on e.g. filtering or stochatsic control in return.
5,The actual role of the probability.,"The book makes us understand the actual importance of the probability.Today the books about the stochastic equations have superated the interest of the traditional analysis.The author explicates with competence the definition of the martingale, filter or Markov chain. The applications are about the finance, the control theory, the problem of stopping."
2,(Not quite) Wrong Kolmogorov backward equation,"His version of Kolmogorov backward equation(Theorem 8.1.1, p. 139) is just wrong. Of course, then his Feynman-Kac formula(Theorem 8.2.1, p. 143) is wrong as well.The correct versions can be found in numerous other books, likeKaratzas and Shreve, Shreve II(2004), Gikhman and Skorokhod, and on and on.The above was my original review. I later realized that technically he was correct given his restrictive definition many pages earlier. Unfortunately, I was seriously burned when I tried to apply it. Professor McCauley wrote a very useful Comment to this review."
5,THE PERFECT SIZE FOR BIG MEALS,"Undoubtedly, this is one of the best pans I've invested in (and luckily got a great ""Gold Box"" deal on this one!) Up until now, my favorite Calphalon pan was the Commercial Hard anodized Everyday pan...I'd used it for stir fry, but it was just a hair too small...the 5 Qt Saute is the perfect size for larger meals...tonight I cooked FOUR chicken breasts (flattened so they were large) and it was just right. Do yourself a favor and go to Calphalon's website for some terrific recipes- they'll turn out like a gourmet chef's! Also pay close attention to the use and care guidelines, and cleanup is a breeze...Don't let the fact that this ISN'T NONSTICK scare you away. Remember that with Calphalon hard-anodized pans, you will cook on a lower setting since the pan heats up quickly and evenly- anyone complaining about difficult cleanup probably hasn't followed Calphalon's recommendations. Invest in this pan- you won't regret it!"
2,A Great disappointment!,"This Sourcebook has been a huge disappointment for me. I have been a Battletech fan since 1993 and have purchased most Sourcebooks and Readouts published by FASA. And I must say that this sourcebook is not close to the old standards, it lacks the customary artwork and layout that is confusing. Fortunately, they were able to fix this with Jihad 3072 and 3076.I give the quality and abundance of artwork only 1 star, and the writing 3 stars."
4,Pretty good so far,"Like the other reviewer, I'm not a big fan of the ""news story"" format, but I still think this is a good sourcebook. It kind of leaves you hanging when it comes to some of the info, but that's what will make me buy the other sourcebooks when they are published. I just hope that all is eventually revealed in these sourcebooks, rather than having to glean things from other sources like their online publisher battlecorps."
5,Greatest book I've seen for entrepreneurs.,"This book could have saved me two or three businesses if it had been written a few years back. It's practical, understandable, and well written. Humorous, too"
5,Outstanding book and easy to read. An unconditional buy!,"Delightful in its view of business. Remarkable in its organization. You can turn anywhere, start reading, and not feel like you missed the first 165 pages. The lessons are memorable. My favorite: ""Every customer has a sword in one hand and a bag of gold in the other. When you have properly assessed customer risk, you will get the bag of gold without falling on the sword."" This book should also be listed under motivational tools, cross referenced under philosophy, and indexed under religion. It is a business bible"
2,Lots of fluff,"Don't waste your money on this book. It doesn't even have any good ideas for starting your own business.I didn't learn a thing I didn't already know. You would be better off buying another book, for example a Guerilla Marketing book, good old Napolean Hill's Think and Grow Rich, or Rich Dad, Poor Dad. I also liked How to make a million with your ideas.Besides being dull and unimaginative, the only purpose I can imagine using this book for is if you have some vague pipe dreams about starting your own business and need to know if you have what it takes. This book will weed you out if you don't have the initial business sense or persistance to learn it."
5,Absence of proof is not proof of absence,"Leave Reviewer #2! to his way, and you to yours. God doesn't care how you got home.I pray for you, and hope you get there."
3,esl vocabulary,"This series of vocabulary books is far too difficult for adult learners of English. The reviews given were inadequate and caused me to order 3 books in the series which I cannot use. Do to the shipping differences I was confused about sending them back. Thank you, Elvira Carpino"
5,Frommer's England,"Of all the travel books I purchased for my first trip to England, the Frommer's edition is the one I used and kept after my trip. It is comprehensive, detailed, and gives good advice. It had all the attractions I wanted to visit and more. They also have a great website as a reference tool."
2,I prefered Rick Steve's Gudie to Great Britain,"I wish I would have purchased Rick Steve's guide before purchasing this one. This guide probably has everything you will need but lacks the personal opinions/suggestions that Rick Steve's book provides. Not a bad book if you want to purchase more than one guidebook, but definitely not my first choice."
5,The Great Indeed,"This cd is absolutely necessary for anyone who wants a well-rounded cd collection. It is an impeccable recording (as are most Bernstein Century recordings) of two excellent pieces. The low strings have a unity that is entirely impressive, and the brass simply adds a flavor to the music that enthralls the listener. I obviously give this recording the highest recommendation."
3,Excellent content for those interested in Bhuddist chants,"For anyone interested in Bhuddist chants with otherworldly instrumental accompaniment, this recording fills the bill. This is the real thing, too, having been recorded live, not a studio rendering. While the live aspect may be one of this recordings strength's, it is also the source of it's one weakness, that being the apparent difficulty in getting the same recording level on the chanting as there is on the instruments; the instruments come through much better. A solid choice in an uncrowded field though."
5,This Stuff Really Words,"My dog has a bad back, he has a herniated disc. He's a rescue, not sure about his history but his back first started going out at around age 2. He would have to get x-rays, be on a ton of medication, etc... The vet told me about Vetri-Disc and said that when it works, it works - but it doesn't always work. For my dog - it works. After multiple times a year of my dog not being able to walk, now it almost never happens. I hide the pill in either wet dog food, cheese or turkey. This stuff really works!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great HIPAA reference,"This book, along with its companion title from the Aspen Health Law and Compliance Electronic Transactions & Privacy Standards (ISBN: 0834220342) are excellent references and quite suitable for management and technologists who have a good handle on HIPAA and are ready to implement the details. As its name implies, the Final Rule on Standards for Privacy provides a definitive look at the privacy requirements, including a section-by section summary of the rule provisions.HIPAA is divided into separate areas for privacy and security. The privacy rule has been finalized, but the security rule is still awaiting finalization. The security rule is expected to be finalized imminently, and the Electronic Transactions & Privacy Standards guide is a good reference to use until then. Although it is similar in content to the 2002 HIPAA Desk Reference, it has a more legal feel to it."
5,great for sunburns!,"Not only great for removing just about any makeup, Noxzema has no toxic fumes and is soothing and moisturizing. We've used it in our family for years for those few occasions when we've suffered from sun burns - the camphor really takes the heat away and the burning sensation.For water-proof make-up, you can't do without Noxzema - and just a dab will do you, and good for exfoliating after make-up removal as well. Truly a miracle product."
5,Great for all ages,"I have a Tumblebus and use these in all my classes. We start at 18 month-6 years. All ages love the stepping stones and there is so many different ways you can use them. We use them for balance, teaching colors, and circuits. Great buy for the price."
3,The Monkey King,"Peking Opera is an acquired taste. With the screeching, tonal, high-pitched singing, it makes even Western opera look (and sound) accessible and ear-friendly. It's more of a challenge when the experience is merely sonic, instead of in the theater.""The Monkey King"" is the operatic version of the beloved Chinese epic ""Journey to the West."" In it,the lead (the Monkey King,of course) goes on a quest to find Buddhist documents in the West (India) From the Buddhist perspective, the West is paradise. ""The Monkey King"" tells of the adventures of the simian king and his animal friends.""The World of Peking Opera"" is a beginner's ear to the ground with this traditional Chinese art. There are excerpts from Monkey King and other operas. Unfortunately, the liner notes don't explain much. It's interesting,as a musical work. It's a journey into the East."
4,Eclectic offering from this Nor-Cal band,"Anyone expecting to hear a plain old rock record from Shadrach is in for a surprise. This self-titled album is a collection of eclectic songs including two covers (""I'm into something good"" and ""Lord I lift your name on high"").This album has a few memorable songs, such as the funky ""Snakebite Medicine"" and the 80s-influenced ""Taste"". The aforementioned cover of ""I'm into something good"" was a worthy rendition of the feel-good oldie, and ""Lord I lift your name on high"" is reggae-style a la Reggae Praise.Shadrach's strength lies in their musicianship -- the instruments are skillfully played, and the lead singer has a pretty good range of vocal skill. This album shows promise, and hopefully Shadrach will continue to write music and produce more albums."
2,"Interesting, but not really as informative as I would have liked>","Hey, if you are a martial arts lover and can stand to see some really bad story-telling and half-a**ed instruction, then please buy this product. It is not an instructional DVD in how to fight most Choy-Li-Fut practioners; it basically is just telling the story of him and Bruce Lee and how he fought in old time Fuoshan; and then shows you how he did it (sort of). I am not saying his skill is bad; just his instruction."
1,crap!,these wing chun dvds are the worst ive bought. he goes way to fast he dont explain anything in detail or at all for that matter. i found michael wong on youtube and learned more in one hour than in all the years trying to figure out what william was doing on here. i definitely DONT recommend these dvds. waste of money and time.i rated it 1 star only because i had too. it wouldnt let me rate it no stars.[...]
1,Not worth it.,"I can only assume that working directly with Choy Li Fut would be both an honor and a tremendous asset to learning the art of Wing Chun. That said, this is among the worst in ""how to"" videos of any sort. This would be a poor video even if a person was a black belt in Wing Chun, but it's even worse if you are hoping to learn Wing Chun... or anything for that matter. Master Choy is often blocking the camera during the very moves he's trying to teach. It's really too bad because the production quality is quite good, but the instruction, directing and choreography are all very poor. I'll be returning it if I can."
2,Not the Avatar you think!,"We thought that getting this Avatar Special Collectors Edition would be getting the movie with extended scenes plus the making of the movie etc, but all it is is three hours of deleted scenes, etc NO MOVIE and not at all what we expected; spent the money for something we really didn't want, all we wanted was the movie with the added scenes. Very misleading ad for this."
1,Utter rubbish,"As stated. Ancient theme, done to death. Try Emerald Forest and Dances with Wolves, and myriads more. The baloney of the Noble Savage myth at its worst."
1,Avatar-ed & Feathered,"This the most sickening form of didactic and whacky environmentalism that I have ever seen or heard. If you could strain out all the tree-hugging stuff, the goddess worship and the outright pantheism, all of which was poured on way too thick, there could be a movie worth seeing. I would have re-written things alot so that there was a win-win for both sides. I am shocked that movies are going down this bumpy road, but I wonder if there are any writers, producers and or directors left who could make a genuinely wholesome film without all the nature worshipping diatribe? It has crowd pleasing stuff. Rent it don't buy it."
2,It goes beyond suspending logic.,"Once again the evil and mean spirited industrial-military complex gets beaten by good spirited ""true blue"" pagans, who dance in circles while talking to trees, using bows and arrows and great, great special effects."
1,Might as well release it on VHS,"I was blown away by the film in theaters, both in 3D and in 2D. I was eagerly awaiting the release of the home video version only to be terribly disappointed in the bare bones version released today. The most technically complex film produced in history and they don't include any real features of note in the initial video release. Unbelievable. Like Fox needs more money. Until the expanded edition comes out, with behind-the-scenes featurettes like picture-in-picture comparisons of actors performances before being digitally enhanced, I am not wasting a dime on this rot. This is a version for your grandma to watch, not anyone else. They should've put it on VHS. That's all it's worth."
3,Not sure I'm a fan.,"My daughter LOVES dinosaurs. Loves them. She got this book for her birthday and was really excited to read it. I didn't read it first before reading to her with her other bed time stories - kind of a mistake. We usually love Boynton books. The characters chosen in this one are odd. Sob and Tremble and Snort? A few of the others are positive and cute, but those are just an odd choice to me. Sob cries all the time and is mopey - Tremble is afraid of everything - and Snort is mean and has nothing to say. My daughter doesn't understand why there are 'not nice' dinosaurs in her book. We read it twice and talked about it and feelings and all that. It's just that this is a cute idea and one my daughter was excited about, but I'm not sure I'm a fan. I'm not sure there is enough positive to outweigh the negative here."
5,Cute,We love this Author and wanted to get another good book from her set for our daughter. We love the idea of the Dinos they are very cute. Great pictures and short stories. A fun bedtime book for your little ones or during the day.
4,Indispensable and inspiring 4th...but mastering/editing error in the Capriccio,"This is a must-hear recording of the 4th: intense performance, and excellent sound for 1958.The 1960 performance of the Capriccio Italien is good, too, but ruined by an editing error in this reissue: at 2'45"" to 2'50"", one of the quietest passages, the music is superimposed on itself. I checked back to one of the LP issues of the performance, and the problem wasn't there; it's only in this 1999 CD issue. And, sure enough, the timing is 5 seconds shorter on this CD than on the LP....I'd buy this for the 4th, anyway. I did. The dessert just has that one weird bite of salt in it."
3,Tuxedo Cat Earrings,I LIKE this pair of tuxedo cat earrings. They fit snug against your ears with posts that fit on other side of ear(non-hanging). I have found that hanging ones are easier to insert though.
5,Buy Several Double Pot Rack Hooks,"The Calphalon Double Pot Rack Hook works well on the ""cross beams"" of the Calphalon wall rack and hanging racks. You can use them to hang two omelet/frying pans back-to-back or as Calphalon suggests, a pan with its lid. For the wall rack, I recommend buying 2-4 double hooks; for the hanging racks, where you have more room, buy as many as you think you might need. It takes time and planning to get your hanging arrangement the way you want it. As your collection of Calphalon grows, remember to order extra pot hooks too!"
3,Essential but expensive,"I was kinda blown away by the price so I went out and found some other cheap hooks, but as fate would have it they dont fit the calphalon pots handle holes. So I ponied up and bought a few sets for the pot rack I made. Have to admit they are sturdy and they do the job well, I just wish they were chheaper."
2,Symbio Very Limited,"I recently purchased a Toshiba 52HM94 and a Symbio 160HD4... plus the stand. Unfortunately the TV Guide service does not work through my Comcast cable service here in Sarasota FL. What this means is that the Symbio becomes a rock on the shelf under the TV. To make things even worse, the cable card didn't work in the TV. And since the Symbio will only record from the antenna or video1 inputs (not recording from HDMI or Component Video inputs!!!!), I can only record SD broadcasts.Luckily Comcast has a really good DVR that records HD and they only charge $10 per month. Perhaps some day I can find someone who wants to buy my Symbio.RRS"
1,Greasy,I usually like Neutrogena and am loyal to their other facial products. This product is too greasy and leaves my face shiny. It feels like a film. Will not purchase again.
1,horrible,got a major rash from putting it on the first time and I didn't use anything else. my whole face was practically swollen. I scared alot of people with my face. I had to put alot of steroid cream for the swelling to go down. It took a couple of days for my face to get back to normal.
1,Not worth it,"I bought this moisturizer a week ago. I used it for 2 days before I discovered on day three it was giving me a rash. On day three I was rubbing it on and I felt bumps, not acne, just bumps along my jawline. After I finished applying the moisturizer my face just burned. I had pink blotches all over and have been super itchy. I have not put anything on my face the past two days and I am still itching. Also, it has a heavy sunscreen smell that lasts all day, and it is very thick and greasy. I will never buy this again."
2,oily and greasy,i am using this on my hand and body. when i used it on my face it started shining for 15 minutes and then my face became greasy very fast... excellent for hand and body
5,WOW Fast Shipping & Delivery,Got it way before estimated time this product is what I needed will tell you all later how it's been doing. my face is quite red allot of the time.Update: Makes my face feel good and soft take care of the red. Good price too.
5,A BLESSING FROM GOD!,"I have very dry skin, but it is also acne prone due to its sensitivity to chemicals. I usually don't have TOO much of a problem with breakouts (unless my aunt Flo is in town) so I didn't have to wash my face with anything more than a damp wash cloth. However, I tried Biotin supplements for my hair and nails and it gave me cystic ance! So I washed my face with raw, liquid black soap and applied this at night and woke up the next morning with nearly flawless skin. I KID YOU NOT by the second/third day of using it my skin was moisturized, it wasn't greasy, and my skin tone was brightened and evening up. I will advise that you only use it before you go to bed and wash with just water in the morning as it can make you shiny later on in the day if you're not applying any make up. Overall, it does its job and what is promised on the package. I first used it as a sample product and will now be a lifelong customer."
4,good cheap moisturizer,"was looking for a facial moisturizer that had SPF and wasn't oily, and i decided to try this one to see how it compared to more expensive ones (like the Menscience moisturizer). it definitely is light and i like it but it doesn't leave the face as nice feeling as the more expensive Menscience Advanced Face Lotion. however, that product doesn't have SPF, so i went with the Neutrogena, which does the job fine and is a good price. i'm not that fancy. yet."
4,My kids LOVE these,"Not only do our kids love to play and collect these, us adults do too:) Some are hard to put together, some break on occasion, but a little glue and or tape, and they're quit functional. We have hundreds of these, and this seller has always been prompt. Great stocking stuffers!!!"
4,Wayne Sleep and Kelly Hunter in CABARET,"A pretty good recording of a successful revival. Wayne Sleep headlines this production of CABARET in which he sheds his Royal Ballet image and flaunts his theatrical clout. While not having the vocal finesse of Joel Grey, Sleep makes a fine impression as the asexual Emcee. His rendition of ""Two Ladies"" is curiously fascinating.A very strong cast is evident here, and no more so than in the two female leads: Kelly Hunter gives us a pixie-like Sally Bowles and Vivienne Martin is a heartbreaking though very comical Frau Schneider. Hunter is affective in her desperate clutch for redemption in ""Maybe This Time"", while Martin is in fine voice in ""What Would You Do?"".Rounding out the cast are Grazina Frame (BLITZ!), Oscar Masteroff, Peter Land and Rodney Cottam.This was the last major London revival before Sam Mendes' revolutionary revival at the Donmar Warehouse starring Alan Cumming and Jane Horrocks; which later transferred to Broadway in 1998."
4,The Embroidered Canon,"I find this book, as others in the series, a delightful addition to the Sherlockian canon. The adventures of Irene Adler loop in and around the known timeline of Sherlock's exploits, and the few tantalizing glimpses we have of the Great Detective keep him very definitely in character, unlike many ham-handed attempts by other authors. I highly recommend the entire series, and can't wait until it moves into the mysterious 2-year hiatus so unsatisfactorily explained by Mr. Holmes after his supposed death."
1,"Tedious, Too repetitious, contradictory in many instants.","This book could have been half the length it was if the author had not inserted so many references to past books. One minute the narator would tell someone she was adventurous, then later, deny that she was. The constant references to propriety became tedious. I ended up skimming the last half."
3,"Interesting story, sometimes confusing","First of all, the title of this book is a bit misleading. And even the synopsis on the dust jacket seemed to suggest this was a different story than it really is. In reality, this is just a story of General Stillwell and the Burma theater of WWII. It's not quite as dramatic and thrilling as the publisher would like you to believe. That being said, it's not a bad book. It does a fine enough job telling the story of the war in Burma, all the facts are there. But the way the timeline is presented in a few places can be a little confusing.I expected this to be a story along the lines of Ghost Soldiers or Flyboys, which appeal to the mass public, but this is probably a book best reserved for history buffs. It's more history than it is storytelling. Overall, I'm glad I read it; this is a part of WWII that doesn't get much coverage, so it's worth knowing about. But maybe there's a better book out there on this same topic."
4,Interesting read on a little known subject,"I enjoy reading military history, but the China, Burma, India theater of operations is part of WW II that I had never read about. What I knew or know about it comes mostly from watching the History Channal, but I saw the author on Book Notes on C-Span and decided to read the reviews of it on Amazon. The author was intersting on Book Notes and the disparity of the reviews intriqued me, so I purchased it. I found it both an interesting and engrossing read, and would certainly recommend to anyone who is interested in a part of WW II that took a back seat to both the war in Europe and the war in the Pacific."
5,An accurate account of this theatre of war,"This is hard to listen to sometimes because of all of the suffering of the allied troops.From what I know, its an accurate account of what happened and is an excellent listen."
1,My love for this book,The author of this book is somebody you should not pay attention to at all. You should be very careful before reading this book. I highly doubt that the author was even there at all.
2,There are much better books out their,"I was very disappointed in this book -- and I am returning it rather than give it to our ring bearer. I found the book to be much too specific to fit our needs (the ring bearer is refered to as ""I"" but the wedding is specifically described as his older brother and he will have to miss the soccer game in order to go to the wedding). The first person writing will make if difficult for children to identify with the book, since the details are unlikely to fit most circumstances. I found another book that told the story of a child name Bobby, to be a much better fit, because kids can differentite between a character and themselves much easier than between ""I"" and themselves.I was also disappointed that the flower girl book was almost a verbatim version of this book."
1,Very Impersonal,"I bought this for my son from my first marriage, he is 5. He is the ring bearer for my upcoming wedding. I was mad that it has a story of some other little boy who was the ringbearer for his brother. I also hated the fact that he talked about his gift from the groom, a watch that could go under water, so now that is what my son seems to think he will get. It would have been nice if the story had not gone into so much detail, and left it a bit open to the imagination."
2,Might not fit everyone's circumstances,"At first I thought the book was really cute, but I agree with other reviewers that it was too specific. I realized I'll have to return it when I got to the page that said that his mom and dad held hands through the wedding, as my little ringbearer's parents are divorced. Disappointing that they wouldn't take that possibility into consideration."
1,Save the frustration,The card failed to recognize the RAID array. I spent 10-12 hours scouring the internetfor answers. I found a lot of other issue people were having. At the time this cardwas ordered it was shown a Mac supported card for a PCIe slot Mac tower.Then in just a couple of weeks the card disappeared from HighPoint's Mac website.Also the downloads for newer drivers also were gone. After another 3 weeks ofa futile attempt at calling and emailing HighPoint support with no responseAmazon stepped up to the plate and let me return it.I would tell anybody buying a HighPoint product to be very careful as the supportfrom the maker is apparently non-existent.
4,It creates a Raid array,"Before you buy this, know what you're getting into. This is not a ""hardware"" raid card - there is no built in CPU like other high end (and much more expensive) RAID cards, so you're not going to set any performance records.That said, my only goal was to build a RAID 5 array for fault tolerance of a single drive failure. I built 4 drive arrays in Windows Vista x64, SuSE, CentOS, and Ubuntu without issues - though in each case I had to install or compile the driver. (Honestly, if you're looking into a RAID array, you should know how to do this). All the documents and files are on High-Point's website, though that's a little lacking.This model also uses a PCI-Express slot, make sure you have one free and that it's not blocked by an oversized video card before purchasing!So why only 4 stars? Just because it's still pricey for the features (built in motherboards can almost do the same thing now), but at least you can take it with you when you change machines!"
5,Love the stuff,"I've had my set of Sitram Profiserie cookware for about a year now and I couldn't be happier. I don't cook with them every single day, but it's not an odd occurance for me to have them going on all four burners when I do. When I'm done I throw 'em in the dishwasher and they shine up nice. I LOVE the fact that I can have the heat down low to simmer something, and the entire bottom of the pot simmers. There's no hot spot in the middle. I haven't had any problems with the welded as opposed to riveted handles. Solid cookware for a reasonable price...What more can you ask for?"
4,Painful Pregnancy,"I had a lot of cramps during my pregnancy, which got worse as I grew. The pillow definately gives support. You just need to adjust it and find the right position for you. It is also not very convenient if you want to change positions through out the night and the velcro is pretty painful if you skin is exposed to it. But overall, I would recommend it, it did help me get comfortable, good uterus and back support."
2,Might be okay if you buy it soon enough,"By the time I actually purchased this, around my eighth month, I was already used to sleeping on my side. The problems I was having of basic discomfort and pain when sleeping were not helped by this product. If I wanted to move at all I had to wrestle with it to move it and I still hurt all the time. I guess by that point nothing would have helped. It might be useful if you buy it very early on, though."
2,Flimsy,This is really not supportive at all. It's a good idea in theory but the pillows just get smooshed under the weight of your back/belly.
2,Not worth it,"I bought the pregnancy wedge, because I wanted to have some tummy and back support. It offers a little bit of support, but if you move at night, this product will not help you. You have to lay in the same position, unless you want to sit up and turn it around. You also cannot lay on your back. I used it two nights, and have not used it since!"
2,Not Crazy about this Wedge,"I am 6 and a half months pregnant. I got this pillow a month and a half ago after reading the favorable reviews. I quit using it pretty quickly. Maybe I toss and turn too much for this sort of wedge, but I would consistently wake up with the wedge under me in such a way that I was being stabbed by sharp edges on the velcro (which is underneath)! I am much more comfortable sleeping on my left side with 4 pillows... some skinny and some fluffy ...and a teddy bear (my hubby gets to teeter on the edge of the bed) ;-)"
4,Great product!,"I was not too sure I wanted to purchase something like this online, but I am sure glad I did. I started using this heavily from my 6th month on and it has really helped me get a full nights sleep. I find I do have to roll over about 1 or two times a night and I just rotate the pillow to accomodate. Once you are in the habit of doing that, it is no big deal. The velcro is adjustable and can easily fit all body sizes. The pillow provides great back and tummy support and you can lean into the back wedge so that all of your weight isn't directly on your hip. This pillow helped me with my hip soreness. Great product!"
2,Large Black Hand Necklace Chain Ring Jewelry Showcase Display,Not the quality I was expecting. Product was flimsy and a not the best quality. Definitely would not recommend this item
4,Not hard to understand,"I don't think anyone really likes their accounting books, but this one isn't too bad. I bought it used as a supplement to the book my class was using (Kimmel, Weygandt and Kieso), when I got completely confused by that one. Having two different explanations of the same subject helped. However, don't be surprised to see the exact same cheesy diagrams. The index is good and I use this book for reference. Unlike Kimmel, this book also covers ""interpreting financial statements,"" payroll accounting (in brief), and special journals (cash receipts/cash payments) and subsidiary ledgers. My school actually uses the special journal appendix as a photocopied handout for another class. There is also a cheap DVD (available from the publisher for less than $1) which goes along with this book that absolutely saved my life."
3,Could have been better,"A bit dissapointing that the arrangements in the book are so bland and simple with the melody doubled in the piano and basic work added around this. With great vocal scores like 'Wicked', 'The Producers'and 'Witches of Eastwick'available with fantastic accompaniments 'Spamalot' is a tad dissapointing. However, all the great numbers from the show are here and with a talented accompanist to improve the arrangments this book is still a great buy."
3,Spamalot Vocal Selections,"Funny show and enjoyable music. At least one of the songs is not in the same key as what's sung on the original Broadway cast CD - an annoyance but rather typical of ""vocal selections"" music books. This is the publisher's decision (Hal Leonard), not Amazon's fault. On the positive side, this book has many of the songs and is much cheaper than the full piano-vocal score."
5,Excellent for Reminescing the Movie on the Road,"I've thoroughly enjoyed listening and relistening to the songs on this CD while on the road. It's funny to hear how Broadway-ized the memorable scenes from the movie are in these songs. The only thing that came close to disappointment was not hearing the phrase ""silly Enlish k-nig-ht"" during the ""Run Away"" song."
1,Didn't Last A Day!,"My husband got a pair for Christmas. They did NOT live up to the product description. They were loose, soft and comfortable, but forget the durable. These ""Work Horse"" jeans only made it to work for 3 hours before they split from the crotch down the leg about 3""-4"". At $29.99 that works out about $10 per hour for wear--definitely not a good deal. Will stick to the Rip Stop jeans from now on, as they have proven to last."
1,very thin material,"the material was very thin and tore very easy I waited too long I am sure to send back to them I was very sorry I bought them I still have a couple pair of them that I havent even took the tags off of them, not worth my time to even get the rest out of the box.."
1,Hard to clean,I would never buy these products again. I replaced my entire set with stainless steel.
5,Engrossing,I didn't want to put it down. I could feel his misery as he sat in the nursing home. Behinds the scenes of the circus were great. It was easy to get to know all the character and care about some (hate others).
4,Fast read,"I really enjoyed reading this book. The writer describes the settings so vividly, you really feel like you are there at the circus! I gave it 4 stars as I felt the ending was rushed. It felt as though there was a deadline the writer was trying to meet, so she wrapped everything up quickly and lost a bit of her beginning writing style in the process. Overall, I enjoyed it and would recommend it."
3,Disclaimer: Book is Sexually Explicit,"I purchased this book mostly because of my curiosity of a circus themed novel (and because I recently started seeing trailers for the movie). Before I purchased it, I took the time to look at its rating and reviews. With most of the reviews that I read, people expressed enjoyment.When I started reading, I quickly became disappointed by the lewd sexual descriptions. After completing the book, I went back and looked over reviews. Most people didn't give a disclaimer that this book is at times sexually explicit.I must admit that I do consider myself more conservative then most people. So my only disclaimer with this novel is that if YOU do not appreciate sexually explicit descriptions and cussing - I would not recommend this book to you.I was not completely disappointed. But, I think that this book would have been just as good if these sexual explicit descriptions were left out."
3,Bored,"I only gave this book 3 stars because it wasn't bad, it just really wasn't that good. It's a good book for preteens or high schoolers. The ending was rushed and it appeared to me that the author just wanted to finish the book and get over with it.It just needed something more about elephants, I guess."
4,Great read!,"I enjoyed the history and details of a circus during the Great Depression as much as I liked the story. The characters were fascinating, but I think the chemistry between Jacob and Marlena could have been developed a bit more for the love story line running throughout the book. Overall, an excellent read. This would make a great book club selection."
2,SOS,"""SOS"" Same old story. Guy falls for girl who is ""off limits"". Girl returns his interest. Blah Blah Blah then run off together and bad spouse/lover/partner gets it in the end, SOS.Don't get me wrong I'm a sucker for these stories but only after I become invested in the characters. It seems that the author knew it was an ""SOS"" and didn't bother to spend the time developing the charters and intriguing the readers. By the end of the book it knew what was going to happen and didn't care."
2,Water for Elephants: A lot of Hype and Little Substance.,"I read Water for Elephants hoping for an epic love story set in the traveling circus, but instead I found myself covered in the muck of vividly lewd details and unbelievable relationships. The love story is non-existent. The two main characters only seem to come together out of a desire to escape the ugliness and cruelty of the situations they have found themselves in. I never believed it.While I found the ending vaguely satisfying, most of the plot felt contrived and unrealistic, particularly for a book that was extensively researched for detail. I did believe most of the more peculiar details, but, when strung together, these details didn't make a very cohesive or believable story. Ultimately, I found the book disappointing, overly lascivious, and poorly crafted from beginning to end."
4,well-done!,"I really enjoyed this. The 'past' story is brilliant--I loved how we return to the Prologue events at the end. Not so impressed with the ending of the book itself (the 'present'), but otherwise, entertaining and enjoyable. Well-executed!"
4,Enjoyed it!,"Waited awhile to read this book and a friend recommended it to me...so I thought...why not? I loved the story of the circus and felt like I could picture everything. It was a very, easy read and found myself wanting to have more time to enjoy it :) Now, what are YOU waiting for?"
4,GREAT BOOK CLUB BOOK,"We all thorougly enjoyed this quick read. Well written and quite descriptive. I am now reading Sara's first book, Riding Lessons. My 14-year-old also read this book and found she could not put it down."
4,researcher gets it right,amazing to me that a woman with no actual circus experience could write so knowingly about it and could capture the nursing home environment from a man's perspective. I am a product of that age and felt comfortable with her representation.
5,Delightful Romp through Depression times Circus,"Well written and entertaining. Good research on subject area and then wonderful character studies. I love books that keep me eagerly reading to ""see what happens next."" Loved her moving from present to past."
4,Good read,"I read alot...and a book has to catch my attention right away, water for elephants did just that and kept me interested all the way thru. Liked that the book didnt leave any loose ends."
4,loved it!,"This book was great. I was very skeptical that I would enjoy the book after reading the description on my book club's website. However, I enjoyed this book thoroughly. I felt like I was there with the main character watching the events unfold. I even did some research after the book was over because I was left wanting to know more about the events that the author researched to write the book. I enjoy books that tell a story about life and how the character's feel while living, their motivations, their history, their happiness, their sadness . . . this book was great."
4,Weaving the present with the past,"I am never into the 'Oprah's book club' genre type of books, however I saw that a movie was being made of it, read the synopsis and gave it a try. I wasn't disappointed. What an enjoyable read! While the ending was a bit cliche, it was still a very interesting and entertaining book. The author weaving the past with the present really moved the story along and helped gain sympathy for our lead character. I would definitely recommend this book - especially to all those that don't usually appreciate the 'book of the month club' type of books. And even though I'm probably one of the only people I know that is NOT into Rob Pattinson, (LOL!) I would definitely like to see this movie. I read this on my Kindle and wish I had bought it in paperback so I could have shared it."
4,Great book!,Water for Elephants is a great book that pulls you in right from the start. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone. I did not give it 5 stars because it was not a book that I 'couldn't put down'. Still a wonderful book and I look forward to seeing the movie.
4,Great and fast read!,"I thought this book was an interesting and quick read. The story pretty much grabs you instantly and I finished the book within a couple days. I'm always in the market for a good love story and this book was fast paced and interesting. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I'm looking forward to it. I love Reese Witherspoon. I would recommend this book!"
5,I loved it !!!,If you love the circus then you will like this book. If your an animal lover you will cry and then you will laugh. Awesome book !!!
5,Fantastic Read!,"This book was phenomenal! Once I started, I could not put it down until it was finished. It keeps you completely engaged while telling a fantastic story. I am so impressed by the research that was done before the writing of this book-- it definitely shows!"
5,It made my Christmas letter books-you-must read list,The startling life of a man left behind in a home stays with you. Each of us happily cheers for the hero as he drifts back to his circus days. You only hope your own life is as full where romance and engaging performers tug at your soul. A+.
4,"Finally, a good book","I have been disappointed recently in some of the books I have read. So when I started reading this one, I didn't have high expectations. However, immediately I was drawn into the characters and couldn't put it down. One of the best books I have read in a long time."
4,Fabulous,I just loved this book. The author certainly did her homework on this one. Don't be turned off by the circus because the story is so much more than that. The characters are endearing and the story wonderful to read
4,Agua por Elefantes,This is a good book that keeps you interested through the whole thing. The characters are developed nicely and it has a great ending
5,Very good!,"My friends read this book ages ago and had talked about it before the movie came out. They said I MUST read this frist and that it was so much deeper, darker and over all a better story. I really enjoyed the main character then and now, and how much his story felt like the old man who sat at my Grandparents table in the assisted living when I was a young child. Great book for adults. If a younger reader reads it, it might be best if someone else has read it to talk a few spots over with them."
5,Perfect Read,"This book is in my top five. i loved the character and all his struggles, i love how you can so easily fall into the character and see what he sees, in the home and in the circus."
4,Have read better!,Well written but just not my type of story. I'm not a circus fan so I guess didn't care for the setting.
4,Nice quick read...,"This book caught my attention because I like the era and the Freaks and Geeks themed books. I enjoyed this book, however felt that the story lacked in some areas. I felt that a lot could have been better if the author dug deeper into the characters. The old man version seemed more realistic to me than the young Jacob and his Marlena. I would recommend this book to a friend for a quick read."
2,Simply a poor read,"I guess I expected better with all the movie hype. I read the whole book hoping for it to improve, but I was disappointed. I wonder if the movie came first?"
4,A Must Read if you Plan on Getting Old,"Well written, well researched and interesting look into a subject I knew little about. Although the book was about circus trains during the depression years, the real message was that getting old is ""hell."" What a heart wrenching portrayal of this man recalling his few years when he ran away and joined the circus. But mostly how horrible it is to be old, forgetting important things and having family forget you. Rosie the Elephant is a wonderful character."
4,"Slow start, great finish","This book was highly recommended to me, but it took a couple tries for me to get started. Once the circus train has left the station, however, it is a very engaging narrative."
4,Great Read!,"This book had a bit of everything! At first I did not think I would be interested in reading about a circus, but that quickly changed!!!!"
4,Loved it!,"I admit it, I liked this book. It revolves around themes of ""who is my family"" when one is adrift at sea, biologically speaking. I know there are criticisms of the cruelty to animals issues and I was uncomfortable with them also. However, the story is set in the 1920-30's and it is about the circus. I believe Ms. Gruen wrote accurately about how animals fared in that time and place.Reviewed by Holly Weiss, author of Crestmont"
3,"Fun, interesting read - good for summer/vacation reading","This is the type of novel I'd recommend for anyone looking for a summer/vacation novel. The parts set during the Depression Circus are interesting and the whole novel is easy to read. The book isn't going to change your life or change your way of thinking, but it's quick and keeps your interest. It's definitely better to read than cheesy romance novels or vampire books so give this novel a shot and I'm sure you'll enjoy it!"
2,Poor dialogue and characterization,"Though the plot occasionally compels page-turning, the author's tin ear for dialogue and the weak characterization make Water for Elephants much less exciting than one might expect given the hype that it has attracted."
3,Didn't even finish.,"This book came highly recommended, so I bought it for my Kindle App. I tried to read it while on vacation this summer, but I didn't even finish it. I am giving it 3 stars instead of 2 just in case is got better. The only complaint I have is that it had an extreme number of uncalled for sexual instances. I mean, you can tell an excellent story without talking about some of the things mentioned. There were so many instances, and I did not even read the whole thing, that I felt uncomfortable. Uncalled for. Unnecessary. Thoroughly disappointed. I have heard the movie is good...I never say this, but maybe I will just see it...but probably not."
3,"I have never thought of giving a book a ""content suitability for certain audiences"" rating before I read this one.","I have never thought of giving a book a ""content suitability for certain audiences"" rating before I read this one. I would have to give this an ""X: Adults Only"" rating due to the explicit sexual content, violence and language which I found unnecessary for this story line.This story tells a tale of two time lines in the life of a circus veterinarian. It begins as the elderly version of the man who is forced into memories of his youth. Through the story, he is transported back and forth between the two time lines. This is the first dual time line story that I've actually enjoyed. With the exception of the ""X"" rated parts. This is a delightful easy read. The author has a talent for description which allows the reader to easily become absorbed by the story line. She has done quite a bit of research into circuses of the past, which helps to make the story more authentic."
3,Entertaining but lacking something...,Let me start by saying I liked this book. Jacob as a character was very likable and you wanted to find out what happened throughout his life with the circus. I loved how vividly the circus scenes were written. I got a clear mental picture. That being said... There was an abrupt ending of storylines and at one point she tied things together in a nice little bow. The book was a little inconsistent in the way it was written but overall an enjoyable read. I liked the ending alot. I won't spoil it but it seemed very natural of Jacob's character. I hope this review helps some of you. Water For Elephants is a worthwhile read.
5,Love it!!!,"I haven't read novels in many many years and I decided to pick this up at Target. I had no idea it was going to be a movie. I have to say it was incredibly engrossing, and so much fun to be a part of this other world of train circuses! This is a short review, others have said it better. I'll just say, don't hesitate. Just get it!"
4,Really great read!,I thought this book was a very entertaining and satisfying read! Finished it in two days! Gruen's story is both touching and funny and I'm eager to read more of her work.
5,Great Reading!,"This is a wonderful book and a ""must read""! The story is very heartfelt. I was amazed at the end to find out that the author had done so much research to make sure the story, characters, etc. were so true to life! Good job Sara Gruen!"
5,Insight into an elderly man's thoughts,"Water for Elephants: A NovelThis novel offers interesting insights into the thoughts of an elderly man in a nursing home.Because my own father is in a nursing home and has been diagnosed as having Alzheimer's Disease, I found this to be a poignant story of an elderly man and his struggle to maintain his dignity and humanity in the confines of a nursing home. The reality of his life in the nursing home is juxtaposed with memories of a short period of his life some seventy years earlier when by an odd turn of fate he became the acting veterinarian for a travelling circus.I suggest it as required reading for any one who is involved in care of the elderly whether as a relative or a professional in a facility."
5,Fantastic read,I truly enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down once I started it! It was really interesting how the author intertwined a lot of info on the circus while telling a true love story.
3,good,"From the first page, this book swept me away and deposited me in the book. It's a gritty story with a bitter taste of an awful dream and it was well researched. The only reason the ratings are so low is because in the end, it didn't feel like it was something worth reading. I was entertained, but that was sort of it."
5,"Great story, masterfully written","Not sure what else to say, just a beautifully told story capturing the whole of the characters' charm, quirks and warts."
4,Worth reading,The book offered a glimpse into a past lifestyle and I found it interesting. Perhaps a little silly and could have included more history but all in all I enjoyed it.
1,Depressing,"The book was very well written but I need something with a bit more happiness. Maybe it was tough for me to feel connected to the subject. Or is was just too depressing. Most likely it was both. I even suggested the book to a few other people to see if I was alone in my feelings, they couldn't even finish the book."
1,Water for Elephants,I wish there were were a way to give minus stars. Meanwhile please do not waste your money on this unbelievable bore. I kept reading because it got such great reviews so I thought there must be some redeeming surprise ending. Wrong. Totally predictable trash.I usually donate books to the library or the Goodwill after I read them but this one went straight to the garbage can.Rosada
2,should I finish it?,"I'm only a third of the way through, and bored of the contrivance of the characters. I'm particularly bored of seeing the world (past and present) only through Jacob's eyes, and he seems to have non-curious eyes like a camera rather than as a real person with feelings and understanding. The odd sexual references seem very juvenile, voyeuristic and very off-putting. I'm seeing reviews that my disbelief in the narrator's voice is felt by others, and am also seeing that ""it starts off strongly, but then it lost me"". If the last half isn't as good as the first half, and I don't like the first half, then I'm wondering whether I should continue. Very disappointed. I usually get books from the library, but treated myself to a new book to celebrate an accomplishment at work. I wish I'd ignored the positive reviews of this trifle of a novel."
2,Disappointing.,"I had high expectations for this, but it was kind of a chore to finish. It was too depressing! Too much brutality to the circus animals AND the circus humans, drunkenness, filth, squalor -- plus the portrait of life in the nursing home was grim. When the narrator finally gets his true love, the author rushes through it in a few sentences and then goes back to the grimness. I give her two stars because she's obviously done a lot of research on circuses, and I thought the photos were charming."
2,not worth it......,"This book is not what I expected at all.....I guess I expected more of a love story as well as an adventure and what I got was neither. While I give the author credit for her obvious research on the era...the story was so incredibly slow!!! I kept thinking ""is this over yet??"" I wanted to like it I really did. Definitely a disappointment. I wish I thought differently."
3,I wish I could say,"I wish that I could say that I was one of the readers of Water For Elephants, the well researched novel by Sara Gruen, who was graciously transported to the circus world of the 1930's, but sadly I can't.I am not one who acclaims the romance of the beautiful Marlena, the circus horse rider and Jacob, whose personal tragedy causes him to walk away from his final exams at Cornell Vet school. Instead, I am left thinking that perhaps, I should have read Twilight instead. The an essential problem of reading a romance in which the reader does not care for the romantic protagonists, is that it takes the heart out of the book.Though there was enough in the side characters, animals and atmosphere to carry the book but alas there I often found Gruen's phrasing annoying and clunky. I have decided in all fairness to Ms Gruen and her many fans that I will desist from reading any more of her works and we shall all continue on quite happily."
4,Great Book,This book was a quick read but very interesting! Before I was never interested in circuses but now I am! Enjoy the show!
4,Fabulous,"Amazing story of love, animals, and overcoming obstacles! A great read for all who love the circus and a wonderful story."
1,Disappointed,I saw the movie and was so very excited to read the book. I was excited mainly because usually the book is better than the movie. In this case it is my opinion that the movie was better than the book.The first two and half chapters were good. Then language was used which was totally not needed. If that was not bad enough then we get to read a very detailed account of a stripper. This part was detailed way to much and left nothing to the imagination at this point I was so disappointed that I deleted the book from my Kindle and have choose not to complete the book.
3,Would give it a 3.5 if I could,"Sorry to be a lone wolf here as so many seem to love this book. I am wondering what I might have missed. The story just doesn't deliver. I was around during the Great Depression. I was a child, but alive, and remember the excitment of the ""greatest show on earth"". And as much as I enjoyed certain aspects to this story--the circus characters, etc. I could not really get a hold of the main character, Jacob. I felt the story slipped into a cliched romance and became predictable. For the sincerity of the author to capture this time period and world that is long fogotten, I would give this a C+.Not so bad for a light read."
5,Loved This Book,"I loved this book. It was breath-taking alive - as if I could smell it, taste it and feel it. It was like I became lost in the Great Depression era. I so wanted it to end so that I could hear the conclusion of Jacob's life with the circus, but I didn't want it to end because it was such an enjoyable book. I liked the way the story was narrated by Jacob as a young man and as an old man. It is hard to believe that this was not an autobiography."
4,A Worthwhile Read,"First I must mention that I love books that take you to a time and place that you have no knowledge about and in this case it's circus life in the first half of the 1900's. It was fascinating to read what life was like in those days for those who worked in the circus, from performers to the labors. As for the book itself I did enjoy it, but I wouldn't call it a page turner and often in the first quarter of the book I thought about just putting the book down and starting something else a little more exciting to read. However the farther into the book I got the more I started to care about the characters the more invested in the book I became. In the end I was very glad I continued to read the book and now I can say I would recommend the book to friends."
4,Interesting Characters,"It was interesting to read about the conditions of the earlytrain circus shows. As an animal lover, there were parts thatwere difficult to get through. In fact, at one point I was almost going to stop reading the book altogether because it was upsetting. However, I'm glad I plowed through it. The characters were very interesting....."
1,Yuck!,Ugh! What a total waste of time and money. I can not beleive the author relied so heavily on constant erotica. If she could have left that out it may have been a good story. Don't waste your money!
4,Enjoyable Read,"I'm not going to outline the story, I'm going to point out a few flaws in the book and what I liked, to try to help you decide if you should read it for yourself.First, the flaws. It really doesn't take long to figure out where the story is going. You can see it coming a mile away. Second, Ms Gruen is writing the story from a male perspective, but she needs a little more practice. Jacob seemed like a mama's boy, but I don't think that was her intention, instead it was her inability to really connect to her male character.Despite these minor flaws I found the story engrossing and from my male perspective I didn't think it ever got into 'romance novel' territory. So guys, it's safe to read. The trains, boozin' and rough living of a traveling circus in 1931 was very interesting. The way Gruen shifts the novel from the past to Jacob's current state of living in a nursing home is jarring and makes you feel just like Jacob when he is 90, or 93, you want to get back to the circus."
3,Overhyped,"Water for Elephants is the story of Jacob Jankowski. After a tragic accident involving his parents, Jacob feels lost and unsure of his future. One night he hops a train - only to find that he's hopped a circus train. Because he is ""almost"" a vetrenarian they welcome him aboard (although not that nicely or easily) and he quickly becomes embroiled in a very predictable love triangle.Gruen does a great job with the transition from the ruminations of 93 year-old Jacob in the nursing home to 22 year-old Jacob on the traveling circus. They're seemless and very well done. Reading about the circus and life on a traveling circus during the depression era was also interesting.My complaint with the novel lies in the fact that as a reader I felt the author just skimmed the surface with this novel. The story was predictable and shallow, and while the characters were decently developed, the overall story line just wasn't that great, IMHO.I was disappointed."
4,Water for Elephants,"Water for Elephants was probably one of the most action-filled novels that I have read. Every chapter was vital. The circus (or carnival) life was a new area for me. It was grimy, brutal and had some of society's misfits... yet there was humanity,loyalty and tenderness,too, thank goodness. I felt it was a well-researched and crafted story."
1,Cruelty is not entertaining,Sara Gruen's talent as a writer was wasted on gratuitous violence and cruelty. It is a shame when a good writer sells out for a potential movie. This is cheap read.
4,Water for Elephants,A wonderfully captivating book that was very difficult to put down. So much historical information regarding train circus' during that time period that you felt you were actually running the rails yourself. Great book!
4,There's gladly an elephant book in the room,"A very charming novel by a bright author. I was worried about reading this because I can't stand reading anything about animal abuse. But somehow Gruen writes so poignantly that I didn't find myself cringing at the animal abuse as much as I did about the characters and the story. The ending isn't as good of a redemption as I would have liked (you will find out what I'm talking about) but it's good enough and such a pleasure all the way through. Especially if anyone has a Polish background it will be even more entertaining for you. I highly recommend this different book about old circuses, old folks and young, and those who like a romantic twist and of course, animals."
4,Couldn't put it down,Loved the parallel between present and past. I Would've liked to have known more of Marlena and Jacob's life together.
3,Great read but wish it was for everyone.,"This book was gripping and for a busy mom who doesn't read much, this book had me hooked. HOWEVER, I don't enjoy the provocative/sexual parts and felt this would have been much better had the author left the details of that out. I won't recommend this to friends because of that, which is disappointing because I loved the story line and how the beginning ties to the end."
4,Great Book!,"The book was great and informative, but lacked the detail I am used to in other works of fiction. But it is a quick read and very compelling."
4,The Circcu,A fun read! I learned a lot about the circus. Sara Gruen did an excellent job of depicting the circus experience in the early 20th century.
3,Expected more.,"With the making of a Film based on this book and all of the rave reviews about it, I guess I had high expectations. Don't get me wrong, I found most of it entertaining, but I think the story lacked in its development, and I never figured out why religion was ever even brought up among the characters in the earlier part of the book, when it apparently had nothing to do with the plot. The ending was also a bit of a let-down because it was just too ""happily ever after"" for me.The funny thing is that I'm not a big fan of Circuses in general, but surprisingly, I found the source material to be rather fascinating, So, if anything, this book will propel me to look into more historical reading material on Circuses from the 19th century to the turn of the 20th Century."
5,Beautifully done!,"What an amazing book! I am not a big fan of fiction, but managed to finish this book within 3 days...during FINALS WEEK! Wonderful novel!"
4,Well written - a great read.,"No time to write a lenghtly review but just suffice it to say that I enjoyed this well written, well crafted novel. A great period peice with a carefully developed plot.Well done Ms. Gruen."
3,2.5 stars,"The story was good but had too many swear words for my taste. The circus storyline was very interesting (ie, how a circus works, what happens behind the scenes, etc). I was also surprised to find a good description of getting old. If you're interested in reading just that part of the book, skip the chapters with pictures at the beginning. In doing so, you'll also skip most of the foul language.I've given this book 3 stars, but it really should be 2 and a half."
2,Fair,"The book arrived in a timely fashion however it was stated that the book was in ""new condition"". You could see that the book had been used quite a bit. It should have been stated that the book was in fair condition not new.I was not pleased."
3,Why is this book on NY TImes Bestseller for such a long time?,Sure it is a well researched book. The detail and description of circus life is very realistic and at times downright disgusting. But what else does this book have that made one of my friends rave that this was the best book she had every read. I'll tell you what....nothing. I partly read this book on the recommendation of friend but I also wanted to read it because it was described as a murder mystery book. A mystery murder it is not and by the end of this book I wanted all of the main characters to go away too! I won't spill any beans but frankly this book deserved less time on the best seller's list and more time on the bottom of my discard pile (the books I will never read again or books that I would like to forget). You make up your mind.
2,WATER FOR ELEPHANTS,"This is quite an unusual book, but the story is told very well. I recommended it to friends."
2,It's alright.,I didn't like this book...I found it depressing and the whole thing just one big sad story. One thing it changed was I will not be going to any circus anytime soon.
3,Great book but a little flat,"The book has some good charactors, interesting story line, but some of the charactors seemed a little flat to me. For example, the roommate in the stock car, I some how felt more connected to him than Jacob. Overall a fun and light read, but just lacking a little depth to the main charactors. I will absolutly read other Sara Gruen, I think she has some good talent as a writer. Just my opinion."
5,A good read,"This book is like no other I've ever read. The setting, main characters, and plot are very interesting, letting you in on a lifestyle that most people would never get to experience. I was totally intrigued from the very first page! A good book and very different. I highly recommend it!"
5,"Quick, amazing read.",I was recommend this book by my mother after seeing a preview for this movie coming out when we were out together. Let me just say she was right it was one of the best books I've read in a long time. Great story and I love how its told through the old man's eyes. I definitely recommend this book!!!
2,Overrated,I heard this book was amazing. A must-read. It isnt. The plot is pretty good. I was drawn in by the writing and intrigued by the subject. But the relationships are not very believable and the ending was just ridiculous fluff. Don't waste your time unless you're REALLY hard up for something to read.
1,How many stars?!?!?!,"WOAH, I'm not sure why this book is so highly rated but I couldn't even continue reading it. Very draging and boring to me. Made it to chapter four and had to stop."
3,Hard to get into,"This was super hard to get into. It took me a good 4 months to get passed the first couple chapters and I had to force myself to read it until about a third of the way through. After that it kind of held my attention. I believe the author took a break due to writers block at one point, so when she came away from that is when the book got more interesting. I do wish the characters had more depth. I found it hard to get mildly attached to anyone, aside from Rosie. Its not completely horrible, but I really don't see how it turned into a best seller aside from the fact that its now a movie with R. Pattinson is the male lead. That is my only guess as to why so many people would give it such high ratings."
2,Water for elephants,I usually like the books over the movies but the book didn't grab my attention the way the movie did....I recommend the movie over the book!
1,boring,"This book bored me to tears! I was reading it for my book club and I kept hoping it would get better, move faster, or something. Nope...very dull in my opinion."
3,Too much foul language,"It was a pretty good book, but I had no idea there would be so much foul language and sexual material in it. I was pretty disappointed in that."
4,Touching,Cute and original love story. Makes people realize that we shouldn't take our youth and loved ones for granted because we will wake up in an old folks home and not recognize ourselves
3,"Fun, but not wonderful","When this book is telling the story of the circus, it is fascinating, describing a world that most readers know nothing about. But, possibly in an attempt to make it more ""commercial"", the author has chosen to focus on the love story, which is predictable. In those scenes, fascination turns to boredom.Use all that research (described in detail at the end of the book), Ms Gruen, to tell us more stories of the roustabouts, performers, animals and freaks of the circus - and forget the ""plot"" and the soap!"
1,Boring Characters,The concept of this book was interesting to me but this book is boring. The characters are one dimensional and the main character is lame. I decided not to finish it after reading other reviews that say it is a waste of time (I got about half way through).
1,I really hated this book,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I have to admit I did not finish it. It was simultaneously boring, cliched, badly written and trite. Oh and repetitive. The only redeeming feature of the book was the parts where Jacob was an old man. If the author could write like that more consistently then she would be on to something. I cannot figure out why people love this book so much. If you compare it to another recently very popular book, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, at least that book was riveting, even though it was also not very well written. I am not looking for Faulkner, but if a book is not high literature it should at least have a compelling plot. This book had neither neither good writing style nor an interesting plot. Don't waste your time."
1,Don't bother,All I have to say is this book was poorly written and painful to read. I would never recommend it. Why so many people thought so highly of it is beyond me.
1,"Terrible, trite writing - how was this a bestseller?","I am increasingly concerned at the state of literature in this country, and this book reaffirmed that concern. How on earth was this so well-received? It had such poor, redundant writing. And for all the reviews about how ""accurate"" it was, the author seems to have forgotten in all her research that hitting someone's wife was quite the norm in the '30s and would not likely have inspired the [trite, redundant] outrage that her poorly-developed caricatured characters expressed.Definitely a mindless read, if that's what you're after."
4,Awesome book!!,"I loved this book. I could hardly put it down, especially towards the end. The only thing I didn't like was that there was a lot of bad language in it."
2,It Ain't Literature,"It ain't literature, but it must substitute for what America no longer creates: Literature. Due to the critical acclaim, I gave it a shot and muscled through. The supporting cast is cookie cutter, the lead elephant his own Hannibal, and the mystery of the protagonist's middle-life revealed with a fizzle. Gruen's best writing reveals the realities of senior living. God knows every writer struggles to produce entertaining, memorable work, but perhaps you've already Red Boxed the movie and saved yourself a few bucks. And hours of eye strain."
2,Lower your expectations.,"I wanted to like this book; however, the reality was the writing was sub-par (it reminded me of a a middle or high school essay on what I did over the Summer) and the characters nor the plot were rich enough to hold my attention."
2,Eh...,"This book wasn't terrible...I did finish it. But I probably only finished it because it was such an easy read. If you like simple books that are straight forward with not much complixity, you might really enjoy this. Once I finished the book, I was just left with an 'eh' feeling. I didn't really feel like it had been worth the time I put into it. There was absolutely no emotional attachment to any characters and that is what I really missed."
2,Not worth all the hype,"It was an ok book. although, I was expecting something a little more. The book seem to drag on. when it did end it ended very sadly."
1,The animal cruelty did not sit well with me at all!,Interesting story about the main charactor but the cruelty inflicted on the elephant and other animals really got to me. The author describes the elephant using such human terms and describes her innocence so clearly that reading about the cruelty was like reading about a child being beaten and having a cigarette thrown in her mouth when she was just trying to communicate.I would NOT recommend this book for anyone who is sensitive to brutality.
2,Shallow,"Found Jacob's obsession with Marlena a little one-sided and sickening. Found Marlena's ""love"" for Jacob shallow and not very believable. Found the old man Jacob scenes unnecessary and poorly written. Overall, an okay read."
2,Trashy,"Sara Gruen has an unbelievable capability of describing filth in all of it's trashy detail. If you like gratuitously vulgar descriptions of adult scenes, this book is for you."
5,Great Transaction!,This book shipped quickly and was exactly as represented. Loved the book- great interesting read.
4,Excellent read,Could not stop reading. Loved the switching from past to present. The characters were all so different kept you guessing what would happen.
4,Do you like a circus story?,"Interesting story of a young mans life that began in turmiol. This story held my attention untill the last page,"
4,Great book. Couldn't put it down. Kept me involved With the characters. Made me feel like I knew all the characters personaly,Recommend this book to everyone. A real eye opener of what life with the show was like. Made me feel like l knew Jacob
2,An edited version would have been nice,"It's apparent early that this book is well-written and I enjoyed the challenge it presented in vocabulary and complex characters. However, it is not for the modest and certainly I would never recommend it to a Christain or youg reader. It is obvious that the author had hollywood in mind becuase the descriptions of several events reach beyond crude. I would have liked it very much if the uglier parts of the story were implied instead of described down to the ""toenail"". Sadly, because of the vulgarity, I did not finish what I had hoped would be one of my favorite reads."
2,Disgustingly crass,"This would have been a great young adult fiction book. However, the author, for some reason, was really into nasty words and graphic sex. Too bad she took the low road and destroyed her book. I don't understand all the people who thought it was brilliant - it was just ""dirty."" However, it had potential."
1,Not so good!,"I read this book because it was recommended to me by a friend. I almost took this book back to the library half way through! It is nasty and I felt like I was reading porn! I finally did finish the book. The second half was better than the first, but still not a book I would ever recommend to anyone. Had the author left the porn out it would have been a lot better."
2,Ugh. 2D and obvious.,"Within the first few pages, it is glaringly obvious where the story seems to be going. Without even one plot twist, the story barrels thru with straight trajectory to exactly where it promised to. Virgin boy loses parents, sees girl, falls in love and must have her.The characters are so thinly drawn its hard to get an idea of any of them. The Jake-Marlena love story is a total joke. So is the middle aged woman trying to write like an old man in a retirement home, or a young man smitten over a girl. Same thing with August as a ""paranoid schizophrenic"". Same goes for Al as some tower of terror. It's certainly an easy read- if you're looking for a poolside book that doesn't require much thought or presence, then this book is for you! Otherwise, you're better off elsewhere."
2,This is a Best-seller?,"As a piece of light beach-reading, this is competent. But it's also boring and flat, and the characters unbelievable. It's very hard to locate the conflict for the first half of the book, and the shifts from the mind of a 93-year old to that of 23-year old is gimmicky and not at all convincing."
2,Each chapter broke my heart,"I simply don't understand the fanfare. Every bit of this story was heartbreaking. The animal abuse (especially Rosie), the human abuse (Walter and Camel, especially), and all of the heartbreaking things that happened at the hands of certain men. What was there to enjoy about this story? Revenge at the end? Ok, so I liked the last 3 pages. But those last 3 pages didn't make up for my sadness throughout the whole of this book. I wish I hadn't read it."
2,The Circus is Redlighted,"After just finish reading this book, I'm not very overwhelmed by it. I, personally, believe Water For Elephants is a bit oversold. It can be compared greatly to Nicholas Sparks' The Notebook, in my opinion. The only uniqueness in this book is that it mainly takes place at a circus. The characters are not well developed, and I didn't have the desire of not being able to ""put the book down"". It was a okay, but nothing too special. I'd still like to see the movie, but only if a friend lends it to me."
4,Warning - Animal Abuse,"I read this book through clenched teeth. Not being able to put it down, yet crying inside. Life was hard for both humans and animals in those days, and I had no doubt that the book would touch on how the animals were treated. I just wish there had been more romance and less abuse."
2,A fast read,This book helped me remember the “good old days“. It was fun remembering how cheap things used to be. Sara helped me see what awaits me in the coming years of my life. It is a great read.
5,Excellent book,I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone! This is a book you can't help but keep reading.So go ahead!
5,Love It,This quickly became one of my most favorite books ever. It was so much better than the movie. I will be rereading this one.
4,Water for Elephants,Very interesting subject matter. Something new for once! Got my attention and kept it from the first page all the way through.
5,Moving,"After seeing the movie I thought I would read the book. Not only was the detail greater, but it was also easier to get to know the characters. A very moving plotline."
5,Water for Elephants,"This is an excellent, well writen book that takes the reader to a world that is seldom encoutered by the average person. It is a well researched account of the USA circus of 1929, including the good and bad. It was a glamarous facade hiding unimagined cruelty to animals and people."
4,"Almost perfect, cheep smut aside","Very well written and and very grabbing. There were, however, 2 raunchy parts that were a little graphic, especially since they didn't really effect the whole story much. These moments felt as if they were elaborated on specifically in to draw in a larger audience via random moments of smut. For me, it cheapened an otherwise 5 star book. Really now, that was an image of a cartoon character that I did not want inside my head!LIke I said. Beautifully written--but I would have preferred if the aforementioned parts were briefly stated so you knew they happened and then moved on [like the rape scenes in Khaled Hosseini's book (Kite runner, or even the marital scenes in 1000 splendid suns) ]."
4,Good Read,We read this as a book club. SOme members went to the movie to compare and were disappointed in the movie. Book is great.
5,Water for elephants,Amazing read! Can't wait to compare to the movie!!!!! (Doubt it will be better than this novel. Props to sara
1,Not my choice!,"The prologue to this book put me off a little, containing as it did a very descriptive act of violence, but I persevered since someone had recommended this book to me. Two more very ugly, explicit and disgusting sexualized ""scenes"" in the very early pages had me deleting the whole thing and not reading any further. I'm told this has been made into a movie, which not only beggars belief, but illustrates why I rarely find a movie these days that is worth watching."
2,Highly disappointing,"Read this for a book club I belong to and was very disappointed in it. The novel is not nearly as imaginative as you would believe, given the premise of the story itself. Aside from the circus setting, this is a very conventional book story-wise. Which isn't necessarily a problem, except that the author attempts to stretch the story beyond what it is, often falling way too in love with her writing and going on for long, descriptive asides that lead nowhere. Ultimately, the story is tied together by a very abrupt and rushed ending. Just very unsatisfying. Not horrible but was a disappointment since there is so much critical acclaim tied to this novel."
2,"A Little Less Water, Please","This is the type of novel I expect to be on the bestseller list and is why I typically overlook popular novels, sometimes to my own detriment. An elderly man, now in a nursing home, looks back on his time spent as a veterinarian in a circus. It's a story that could have been capable of more, but the plot seemed fairly predictable and the characters not that believable or rounded. It wasn't bad, mind you, I guess you could say this elephant was just too watered down."
2,Empty beach read,"This is a fun book to read, that moves fast and will be a ""can't put down"" for some. But it's empty, historically inaccurate and doesn't have meat for those readers who like a more meaningful book that has some kind of richness to the writing, symbolism, message, triumph or loss... it is the story of a man and his reminescences from long ago, which make for a great story for him to tell others over coffee, but not something I'm glad I spent any money or time on. If you're the kind of reader who likes ""light"" type of reading, this book is for you!"
5,Water For Elephants,Water for Elephants: A NovelI absolutely loved the novel. Our book club read it. It is very readable and interesting. I was absorbed right away. It is also informative about the circus life at that time period.
4,Did you ever want to join the circus?,"This is the story of a 90-year-old man who looks back at his years in the circus. But this is no Ringling Brothers, no, this is one of the small circuses struggling to make- it traveling after a three day stop and then on the train to the next stop. It is the life of the vagabond. A story with cruelty, violence, romance- with a ""happy"" ending."
4,Have to finish this one,"I enjoyed the story, although it was a bit sad and depressing at times. However, it was very real. The best part was the ending. It made me cry with happiness for this man. I wish every book made me so happy."
5,Great book,"I needed this book for a book club and it was here in 6 days. Amazing! This is a wonderful adult novel about a time in our history that most of us know very little about. It is easy to read and moves right along. A quick read but very worthwhile. Although it is about the circus, not the kind of circus book to read to the kids!!!!"
5,Read this book!,"This has all the elements of an unforgettable novel: extraordinarily beautiful writing style; fascinating characters about whom you will care deeply; a great plot with a few surprises; enticing character development and just the right combination of love, hope and tragedy."
3,Watered Down,"I found Water for Elephants an easy read. The basic story: an elderly man, living in a nursing home, ruminating on the period of his life when he worked for the circus. I was disappointed that the story/characters were not ""fleshed out"" enough: the basic story about circus life was interesting and could have been alot more satisfying.I thought that the author's correlation of the old man trapped in the nursing home and the animals caged in the circus was a novel approach."
2,Disappointing....,The highly improbable plot and characters were a disappointment. This was not a fun book!
5,Great Book,I loved this book. I am 59 years old yet - which is a constant surprise to me. I can SO identify with a 93 year old who still is young inside. This book has definitely made me rethink how we treat the elderly.
3,circus life,"after a visit to the ringling circus in sarasota,i realized what a good book this is.ican appreciate the fine hardworking performing community.this is a must read for circus lovers."
2,ZzZzZz...meh,"Severely let down given all the hype surrounding this novel. I bought it a few years back and tried to get into it, but failed. Once I heard the novel was being produced as a film, I gave it a second shot. It just was not the fit for me. The author definitely gets 5 stars for her research, but the content lacked invigorating material, leaving it as dry on paper as it was for the imagination. Though I wasn't a fan, my friend loved Water for Elephants and encouraged me to read it prior to knowing I suffered through all 350 pages. Different strokes for different folks..."
4,Great book,I love the circus. This book brings you back to old circus days and the trains. A must read!
4,Life: A circular thing,"I won't give away too much information, but my take on this after reading it was that we are exposed to some wonderful characters, an interesting, albeit a bit slow plotline, a romance and a themes prevalent to me are that true love will survive, animals have feelings too, never say never, life is cyclical (circular) and we are never to old to do anything.A beautiful story, brought me to tears once or twice."
5,captivating from start to finish,I was assigned this book for my book club and had almost no idea what it was about when I sat down to start reading. The author beautifully travels through emotion after emotion as the story unfolds. At times she is brutal and harsh...other times she makes you laugh out loud or want to cry from sheer joy or total sadness. She makes you feel like you were apart of the circus in the 20's expertly using the vocabulary. The most important thing I have to say is that this book was unexpectedly brilliant and a pleasure to read. I suggest it for any type of book lover!
4,Absolutely loved it!,"I had a hard time putting this down. The book drew my right in. There is something for everyone- adventure, romance, drama, and suspense. The mix of truth and fiction make it very relatable. I was sorry it was over, but loved the ending."
5,Water for elephants,"This book was great, a real page turner. I would recommend to a teenage age group for some language and adult like content."
3,Effective description of remembrance,This book tells of a man whose experiences as a young man are recalled when he's in his 90's. the writing is vivid and the experiences of the man when he's young and old are effectively told. My imagination was captured and I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
4,Water for Elephants,Casting for August in film version spot on. Gamer the spirit in this office for Elephants. True that too much.
3,Quick read,Easy and digestible. Enjoyed the weaving of a 93 year old mans past an present although the ending was a little less than believable.
4,Drew me right in!,The first book I read on my new Kindle Fire through the free library. Loved it. Hard to put down. Highly recommend.
5,Loved this story.,Just read it. I loved everything about this story. Amazingly written and well researched. I encourage you to read it. Enjoy!
4,Nice read,"This was the first ever book that i had read, when i first got my kindle. To put it simply it a good nice read. The story line is nice the characters are well developed and have strong qualities. Really theres nothing i could put in words what this book mad me feel. Thats what i look for in a good book. How the story makes me feel how the characters an i respond emotionally towards on an other. When i read i feel as i the story comes to life. And thats what i got out of this book the story came to life so freely and beautifully and th characters showed so muh emotian so much heart that what really made it special. So do yourself a favor and read this book"
4,Good read,Love this book. Nice to know some of the stories were real.This is my 3rd time reading it. First book I read on my Kindle Fire.
2,Opinion,"I thought this book was okay, but I didn't like all the vulgar language. There were some suggestive parts in it that I thought wasn't necessary."
4,Great Read!!,Quick read. Could not put it down. I did not want the book to end. Would highly recommend this book.
3,Sad and hard to read,"I had heard a lot about this book and was excited to read it. It may have suffered from too much anticipation but I wasn't enthralled. I thought it was okay. I found it patched together and in need of a little relief. From old age home to parent's dying to hardships of circus life, I just felt weighed down."
2,Writing Didn't Ring True,"Reasons why I did not like this book:The main character of Water for Elephants faces a terrible tragedy and then gets on a train with little more said about his struggle with this event.The narrator does not ""sound"" like a man and certainly does not sound like a man of 90 years.There is no tension in this book. It never left me wanting to know any more about how a situation would resolve.The main character seems to be working at the circus just to further the plot. He explores no other means of living even though he is an Ivy League educated veterinarian.Overall, Water for Elephants was just not interesting and sounded not true. This is just my opinion and I stopped reading this book just after half way through. Maybe it gets better."
4,A gritty stare backwards,"""Water for Elephants"" is a good read. The writer confesses to being thrilled to be writing something besides technical documents, and this gives rise to minor annoyances, some as trivial as the overuse of ""stare"".The contrast of mores of the Depression Era to modern day is arrestingly authentic. Using 1930's circus lingo is misleading (a ""bull"" elephant named Rosie).The symbolism that is not overtly contrived (the big circus in the sky) is captivating, but there is an the almost desperate struggle to parallel the narrator with the biblical story of Jacob."
5,Excellent Read - Hope A Movie is Made Soon!,"I am an avid reader and enjoy all types of books. This is one of the best books I have read in the last 10 years. It is vividly written, full of colorful, yet believable characters and was painstakingly well-researched. I couldn't put it down. Every high school American History class should have this novel on their reading list. Both of my parents grew up during the Depression and this book greatly enhanced their firsthand recollections of the 30's. Fantastic book. . ."
4,Water for Elephants,"This was an excellent book, and revealed the helplessness of people during the depression years when there were no jobs and they had to accept terrible working conditions and cruel employers."
2,crude,I was disappointed in this book after reading many reviews praising it. It was disgusting and poorly written. It had no redemption and the plot was poor.
1,Horrible! Do not buy from Seller!,"I have yet to receive my book and I'm still waiting on my claim through amazon to be dealt with. Do not buy ANY products from this seller, worst service ever. I didn't even want to give them a star but I had to. I will never use them again."
1,Too Much Trash to Wade Through,"There ""may"" be a good story in this book somewhere... but I for one am not willing to wade through the trash to get it. i.e. within the first few chapters of the book the story explains in ""GRAPHIC"" detail watching a stripper, (for lack of better terms) ride a scarf, and pull the scarf up so tight that her vulva shows etc. Really, do we really need to know that? If you don't like trash don't buy this book, because it's got quite a bit in just the first few chapters. This book was definite refund for me!"
1,don't waste your time,This was probably the worst book I have ever read. I can't believe that there are as many positive reviews as there are! Anyone who is considering buying or reading this book.... don't.
1,Terrible,"I was looking forward to reading this book but SO disappointed. It was all vulgar descriptions, nudity, profanity, and basically no plot. I got halfway through and couldn't get any farther. i don't recommend it."
2,Why destroy a good story,"As a small town child,I always loooked forward to the circus coming to town.I thought this book would bring back memories.However,I was greatly disappointed that the author toook what should have been a good family story and infiltrated it with sexual incidents that added nothing to the story.I suppose the author was trying to make the book more ""saleable"" I would not recommend this book,most certainly not to young readers.What a ruination of what good have been a good story"
5,Excellent read,It's been a long time since I had a chance to really read a book. I often get busy and set it aside and never come back to it. But this book had me reading long into the night and coming back to it when I could. An excellent read. I love all of it.
2,"Oh, how I wanted to love this book...","...but I just couldn't. Honestly, it stressed me out. I wasn't enchanted or transported, just full of anxiety at the turn of every page. I read a lot of books, and I review very few, but this is a book I really wanted to love and had to force myself to finish. I was hoping for something more along the lines of ""Carter Beats the Devil"", but instead I got ""The Devil tortures Carter and his girl and Carter ends up alone in a nursing home."" I just couldn't get behind this story."
2,I don't get it...,"I was given this book by a friend that insisted that I read it, ""It was fabulous"". I read about 100 pages of it and set it down which is something I rarely ever do. A couple months go by and I was at a party where a couple people again said what a great book it was. I decided I had to give it another try so I picked it back up and continued to read it. At the end, I still don't understand the love of this book. I didn't care for the animal brutality and I just never connected with the characters in this book."
3,Water for Elephants: A Novel,I couldn't get into this story. I do not have fourteen more words to add to this. Please excuse me...
4,Got me reading,Haven't read in years. This is a good easy read with a great story and characters. I recommend it for sure.
4,Water for elephants equals enjoyment for readers.,"A truly great read with a slice of American history thrown in. I recommend this book to history buffs and animal lovers , alike."
5,"Nostolgic, Earthy and Riveting",I'm half way through and can't wait be able to take the time to read the rest. The structure and voice of this book is so authentic. I highly recommend it!
4,Water for Elephants,I enjoyed this book from the first engaging chapter to the wonderful ending. I have recommended it to both family and co-workers and look forward to reading more by this author.
5,Water for Elephants,"Wonderful story of circus life in 1930's - 1st person narrative by 93 yr. old man looking back - loved the book; great characters, exciting story; highly recommend"
5,Water for Elephants,I couldn't put this book down. I loved it. There was just such wonderful imagery!! Great book. Don't miss it.M. White
5,Water For Elephants,"Don't write it off due to the bizarre circus setting, Water For Elephants is a must-read for anyone."
4,Wonderful Book,"I truly enjoyed this book except for the parts detailing animal abuse, but I'm very squeamish. WFE is a wonderful book and I definately recommend it to everyone."
4,Entertaining to say the least,"While I am obviously not a critic, let alone a person who has command of the written word, let me say how much I enjoyed this book. Unlike some who have criticized this book, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I read a book for the entertainment and enjoyment value. This book gave me both. I don't try to examine and dissect sentence structure, character portrayals, etc. To the critics, I say get a life or write your own book if you know so much about literature. To all others, I say you will find it a lovely story which will warm your heart."
4,Cute Story,I saw all the great reviews so I gave Water for Elephants a try.I really enjoyed this book. Masterful story line and clever characters.It was a fast read. I can hardly wait to see the movie!
2,Water for Elephants,I did not find this book as good as other readers. I would not have read it if it didn't get the great reviews. T was disappointing. The love story and some of the historic events of the circus were interesting. found the descriptive animal abuse very upsetting. I'm definitely not interested in seeing the movie.
5,loved it!,This was a fantastic book. I will be suggesting it to all of my friends and family to read. cant wait for the movie to come out this spring!
1,Rate this X,"This book made me think we need to start rating books- X for pornography and violence. I felt really cheap reading it and in fact, after a while, I skipped what I could to grab the story and then burn the book. The author presents a stable, educated and old man in a nursing home; then she makes him the main character in a story that even the author admits is all the wildest, most deviant and violent things that ever happened in circus history piled one person's life in 300+ pages. Just bad writing. It's sad this is a best seller. Don't waste your time."
1,So many God#$% and Jesus #$8,"I wanted to love this book, but I had to toss in it disgust. Why is God and Jesus as curse words so COOL suddenly, and everywhere? It's not just sprinkled in this book -- it's like a pillar of the language. Bizzare.I'm not a Bible Belt freak, and I've got a Ph.D. in English --for whatever that's worth as far as my ethos goes."
1,Ran Over,"The book was listed in good condition, but I received the book and it was in sad condition. It looked like it was ran over in transit. It was not packaged properly. That said, kudos to the sales department because they gave me a full refund."
2,To far out for me,"This was a book club assignment, I had not wanted to read this book because I had heard that there was some animal cruelty but as a member I try to appreciate other peoples book choices as they do mine.The cruelty was a little hard to read, especially the beatings of Rosie but I also found myself cringing at the unneccessary sex scenes that were over the top, boredom at the constant threat of tossing people of the train and disbelief at the stampede of the menagerie.I did like the elderly Jacob and his life at the nursing home, I think it shows how elderly people are often ""put on the shelf"" when they become a bother in life...so sad. Then this was spoilt by the idea that he ran away with the circus, was able to sell tickets even if he could not button his shirt and all with the acceptance of the current circus owner.I am sure the circus of that era was not a pleasant place but I think the characters could have been much better developed and the story a little less unbelievable."
4,Excellent readng!,What an enjoyable story! At 65 I have memories of seeing small circuses as well as Ringling Bros. I also find myself wondering about the future ... will I live to a ripe old age ... & will my family still care about me. This book was very well researched & written.
5,"Loved it, great book!","I will not go over every detail about the book but I will say that I loved it and suggest anybody looking for an entertaining book to go out and buy this one right away! I could not put the book down and read it in two days.The book is about a 23 year old who is about to graduate from Cornell to become a veterinarian with his father when both his parents are killed in a car accident. He runs away and jumps a train to join a circus. He becomes the veterinarian of the circus and falls in love with his bosses wife. The book is full of excitement, affair, death and the great disaster, but I will not ruin the book for you."
3,it was ok,"Maybe it was me, but it was just ok for me. There was not a lot of action. it was a sweet love story that took place in the setting of a circus.i like the ending"
3,Worthwhile read!,"Slow to the start - I didn't love it right away, but keep reading. A few chapters in I couldn't put it down. The research and writing are so well done you actually feel like you are under the big top! Would definitely recommend it!"
5,A wonderful book,"WOW. Put this book on your MUST READ list. I bought this book because I was told my father-in-law, who recently passed away, had run away as a 13 yo child to join the circus in Europe. He would have loved this book - he was exactly like the old, cantankerous Joseph, and probably the young one too. (Sara - did you know him?)From the moment I started it, I read straight through until I was done. I cannot remember the last time I did that. It was just an awesome description of circus life AND the life of an old man. It was two intertwined stories that made for a fabulous book. Enjoy."
1,Am I Missing Something?!,"Am I missing something? Why does everyone love this book so much?! I've read about 150 pages and just cannot bring myself to read the rest. It's so boring!! I kept reading, hoping it would get better. People think I'm crazy because I found it so boring. Man joins circus, falls in love. There - now you don't need to read it."
5,Worth your time....,"Get your tissue ready, and be ready for intense feelings! I read this book MANY years ago, before the hype and reread it again with my book club. It was worth a second read, so to have this book as your own is worth it! There is mystery, magic, and injustice. The charcters are strongly built, and the scenery is vivid. If you are looking for more books like this one...check out The Dirty Parts of the Bible. You won't be disappointed either."
3,A lot of hype for an O.K story,"I was told by a friend that this book was amazing. I trusted her opinion since we both have similar preferences in books. However, the events were predictable and the best way to sum up my reaction at the end was ""well... done with that, whatever..."". Its a relaxing read and easy to follow."
3,Just wanted it to be over.,"I found the relationships in this book to be lacking. Read like it was written for a movie. There were some disturbing parts (treatment of animals in particular bothered me) and some under-explored parts (an evil character's struggle with a mental disorder). Basically, it just didn't go deep enough for me. The main character's love story moved really fast but they didn't dive into any reasons for their connection. Hard to explain. I'm not sure why it got amazing reviews."
4,You just cant put it down...,a wonderful story. its like you are there right in front of the old man listening to the story. the descriptive detail is amazing. the movie wont even come close to the detail described in the book.
5,"Loved, Loved, Loved this book","A friend of mine lended me this book and I have to say at first I was not interested in reading it. I'm so glad that I gave it a chance. The first beginning chapters kinda confused me cause it bounced around in time. But once I got into it it was really hard to put it down. I read this book in three days! I fell in love with the 90 or 93 year old man. He remind me so much of my dad that was in a retirement center. This author really did a great job in writing this book. I felt as though I was right there in time (past and presant) with the character. I'm not good at writing reviews but I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed this book. If you are just starting to read it and you are wanting to stop, Don't! You will not regret it. I was saddend to see where one person had said that they were dissapointed in this book and it was a let down. Give it a chance. You won't regret it!"
4,Water for Elephants; a Novel,Water for ElephantsI really enjoy this book. It's written well to keep your interest. I read the book in one day because I wanted to know what happened next. Well done!
5,Wonderful!,"This was the best book I have read in years! I could NOT put it down.. When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about reading it! I would definitely recommend this book to all of my friends. One of my new all-time favorites!"
5,Emotionally wrenching!,"Sara Gruen has written a masterpiece. It is very well written and the author is extremely knowledgeable about what she's writing. I couldn't put it down. It's been a long time since I've read a book in two days; and even though I cried throughout this book, I just had to keep reading. I'm sorry, though, I cannot watch a movie based on this book. If it follows the book closely, I would spend the entire movie crying. If the movie takes a lot of poetic license and is only ""roughly"" based on the book -- well, I hate movies that do that. It's an excellent read and I'm sure the story will stay with me for a very long time."
4,A Good Book,"I like this book. To read through about the depression era and about the lives of people going through it, trying to earn a living, trying to survive is amazing to me. The train traveling circus of the day had to try, really try to also just survive. And the bittersweet love story that is entertwined into this story, I think, is beautiful. Thanks Amazon."
5,One of My Top 5 Favs!,"This is such a captivating narrative! I've read hundreds of books but very rarely does a story touch me the way this one did. I read the whole thing while on a very long flight to Europe and for the life of me, I couldn't put it down. Throughout the whole experience, I laughed and cried, then cried some more. Sarah Gruen is a talented storyteller-the way she is able to give layers to her characters and portray them in such a glamorous yet dark way is so refreshing. The plot fulfills the heart's desire for tragedy, adventure, survival, scandal, romance and humor. Tie it all in with a 1930's struggling circus backdrop and well; you've pretty much got the perfect novel. Judging by the number of times I've read this book (which is at least 3 times) I would say this it definitely in my top 5 favorite reads."
5,Water for elephants,"I really enjoyed this book. will most likely go see movie now because of it. Perfect length, read it on airplane traveling to hawaii. This was worth the cost of $4 something... would read again."
5,Will the movie do it justice?,"While I am not a circus fan, this book takes the reader back to a tragic time in the late 20's and early 30's to ""witness"" the life of the people living the life of the train circus exsistence. I admire the author's work to provide the research to make this story not only horrifying at times, but also has an interest in this era of our history. There were many times I felt that it was difficult to put it down - definitely worth reading..."
1,another doomed affair book,"I thought this book was poorly developed and depressing. Really, can anybody come up with a book that doesn't involve infidelity? This guy threw away his whole life and what was the point of this book? I thought it stunk. I can't even believe I read this tripe. stay away from this author..."
3,Very light read,"While the author clearly did a lot of historical research that greatly enriched the story, I found the book lacked complexity of both plot and characters. I wouldn't be surprised if this book is made into a movie in the next couple of years."
3,OK,A SO-SO BOOK THAT WAS NOT AS GOOD AS I EXPECTED W/ ALL THE GLOWING REVIEWS. BUT IT WAS AN INTERESTING READ ON CIRCUS LIFE.
4,you won't regret reading it!,This is such a nice book. I truely recommend it. You can't put it down after you start reading.
4,Circus Fiction,"Well written story of circus life, the people and circumstances that brought the traveling big top to our lives. You can almost smell the sawdust, the action, the intensity of the people who made this such a happening in the small cities of 20th century America."
4,"Loved it, but FYI","Loved this book. The only thing I wasn't expecting from the novel was all of the sex. I was expecting a romance, but didn't feel like I needed the vivid details and play-by-plays."
2,Hard to get into,"I found this book very slow and hard to get into for the whole first half, then when things started moving along it seemed to end so quickly and violently."
4,Throughly Enjoyed this dated story...,"I have to be honest that I was extremely hesitant to read this book and I had downloaded the sample and debated on it for quite sometime, even though it was being recommended to me on numerous occasions. When I finally picked up my kindle and read the sample, ultimately purchasing this e-book it was such a treat. I enjoyed every minute of this book and the way it flowed; I couldn't put it down. Definitely check out this book, you won't regret it."
5,Water For Elephants,"Was A wonderful book. It kept me wanting to read till I was done. I had watched the movie and I usually don't do that, but the book was exellent. I would read it again and again. I also have recommended several friends to read it."
2,"Sensitive readers, beware...","So much has already been written about the shallow characters and implausible ending... So no need to belabor that point.However, I do want to throw up a Red Flag to those readers who, like me, aren't big fans of profanity. I listened to Water for Elephants on CD and found myself cringing repeatedly at the author's liberal use of the F-word. (And many other words.) Furthermore, the graphic sexuality felt like the author's attempt to titillate and shock her readers with needless cheap thrills. She provided ample details regarding the sexual habits of her characters whilst omitting more relevant ones regarding central relationships and motives.There was an interesting storyline in there somewhere. As to the rest, it could've been toned down."
2,What is all the hype about?,"I was very eager to read this novel. The picture on the cover intrigued me; that's as far as the fascination went. The book was not very interesting. It read like a documentary with a few poorly written graphic scenes to keep its readers reading. I finished it, but wouldn't read it and again and won't recommend it."
4,Hype for Elephants,"This is a sentimental story, with quite a bit of charm. It is touted as a ""crowd pleaser"" and that is probably the reason for its huge success. You do root for the narrator, even if the plot is contrived, the ending obvious, and the characterization somewhat weak.I would have hoped for a more authentic and earthy description of a Depression-era circus, but the writing is watered down. Often the conflicts between the characters are too quickly or conveniently resolved, and the characters seem to be at the mercy of the plot. Major crises are quickly skimmed over, and the true potential of this book is never fully developed.I read this to the end--which says something--but reflecting back on the book I wish it had been stronger and more carefully constructed. 3.5 stars."
2,Not as great as I thought it would be,"I hated this book all the time I was reading it. It was predictable. Think ""The Notebook"" in the Circus. It ended alright, but still wouldn't really recommend it. Rarely are movies better than books, but I hope that this one is."
4,Interesting read,"As I've started to branch out to reading a different type of book, Water for Elephants caught my eye, so I had to pick it up. I am so glad that I did! The setting was so raw and gritty and having it based on the history of circuses made it that much more fascinating. Sara Gruen was able to describe things so that I could easily picture the settings and all the circus workers. I just hope that the movie lives up to the book!"
3,water for elephants : a novel,"i didn't think that iwould like this book, but found that once i became involved with the time period and the characters i did like the book. it was a book club selection from one of my three books clubs, otherwise iwould not have chosen it. but after reading did like it. because of the circus performers handicaps, it may not be appropriate for all readers but the story is so strong that the reader soon forgets the less desirable features of the story."
3,Not detailed enough...,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book and her narration allowed me to feel like I was part of Jacob's life. Having been to various circus shows, I was enthralled to pick up this book and see what it has to offer, especially with the 4.5 average rating from Amazon readers. In the end though, I felt like it was missing so much more.With as strong a backdrop as the depression-era, I would have loved to read more details into America's landscape....and of course as most reviews stated, more character development. The one paragraph about Walter's life hardly rewards him enough given his large part in the novel. It's just not fair to the reader that Jacob's only human friend is given an exerpt and not any more than that. It's unbelievable that we scratch the surface of Auggie, Marlena, Camel...While I don't doubt Gruen's dedication to recreating traveling circus facts, in the end, I would have much rather read a 500 page novel than a 300 page story about finding love."
5,Best I have read this year,"Wonderful - even better than Snowflower and the Secret Fan. The characters are complex but accessible - the story rolls like an action film with the cadence and tempo of a silent movie.I read it far too fast the first time because I was so excited, and later read again so I could savor the richness of the characterization and detail of events.The main character is ostensibly the 23 year old ""vet"", but is it really? I saw Rosie as the main character from her first entrance.Must read and read again!"
4,Great book,"This is a wonderful story and full of interesting information about the circus. I didn't quite know what to expect and wasn't sure that I'd ""love"" its circus setting, but was pleasantly surprised. The story of a boy's youth, as told by himself as an old man, is full of unexpected twists and turns. The many fun and crazy characters made this book really enjoyable to read."
4,"Excellent, Interesting Read.","Water for elephants was the first book that my book group chose to read. Everyone loved it. Great story, characters, and wit. Gruen obviously did lots of research for this book and it shines through. It moves along at a great pace and has alot of interesting facts about that era. A must read!"
3,Over-rated,"When I read a book, I want to immerse myself in it. I don't want jarring inconsistencies to remind me that it's fiction, and not particularly well written fiction at that. The speech of Jacob, who supposedly is in the setting of 70 years ago, is disturbingly nonauthentic. People at that time didn't use the same phrases we use now and putting them in, when you're picturing them in the dress and background of that time period is annoying and unnecessary. This author needed a better editor. It's not a 'best' book and the fact that the author is begging for votes makes you wonder about her integrity."
1,Wish I could delete,"The parts of this book that dealt with the main character in old age, were very insightful and I enjoyed that. But quite honestly had I known that it would detail the abuse of the circus animals and then also the detailed sex acts I would never had purchased this. I wish I knew how to delete it from my Kindle. I also wish someone else had mention this in the reviews that I saw. I NEVER stop reading a book, but had to quit about 35% of the way thru it, it was disgusting and I am not a prude.I would never recommend this book, nor will I venture to the movie."
1,OVER RATED X 10,What is all the hype about? I was not emotionally involved with any of the characters. I thought they were pretty cliched and predictable. The whole thing is predictable. There's one plot twist at the end--but its really not that mind blowing. I feel totally underwhelmed and irritated that I stayed with it until the end. There are better books to read on my precious Christmas Break.
4,Give me water!,"What an enjoyable book! The plot, although at times a little predictable, was refreshing and well written. I fell in love with Jacob young, but especially Jacob old. His frustration with the tricks his body and mind had played on him were real and understandable. His joy at the end of the book put a grin on my face. I know there have been quite a few of you who found the profanity excessive and gratuitous, but I think it fit the station of life and the time period and would not let it stop me from a book this enjoyable. I would recommend this book to anyone, but especially those of you who find the time period of the 30's facinating."
5,Join the Circus!,"Water for Elephants: A NovelA mighty tale (tail?) by a master story-teller. Incredible details result from Sara Gruen's research on the circus and the period. It's a page-turner with a total shocker for an ending. That Ms. Gruen writes from a 90 or 93 year-old-man's point of view shows her mastery of the writer's craft. It's an exciting, beautiful love story as well as a tale about the miseries of the depression and how different people coped with their lot in life. My Dad would have loved it!"
5,You won't put it down!,"This is the type of book where you're reading and forget about the rest of the world. I felt like Alice in Wonderland, lost in another world (1930s) with colorful characters (a circus). Yes, this book is about a circus and, yes, YOU WILL LOVE IT! Definitely a ""re-readable"" book!"
4,"Good Book. Easy read, fun story.","I enjoyed the book, worth the time to read. It wont take much of your time, and the circus history is thrilling."
5,Phenomenally Authentic,"I absolutely loved Water for Elephants. Hands down one of the best novels I have ever read. A completely captivating and entrancing story where the plot moves along at a good pace and you are so connected to the characters you feel as though you are in the story yourself.Sara Guren did a fantastic job developing the characters in a way that was believable, realistic and heartbreakingly honest. She also weaved in some great life lessons that are a useful and sometimes painful take away for the reader.I highly recommend this read for anyone who likes authentic, characted developed, well-paced novels.Will definitely read again!"
4,Different,"I liked the book. It was very different from what I usually pick, but I have heard so many people talking about it I had to buy it. I'm glad I decided to read it."
2,Nothing spectacular - pretty lame,"Considering the author never went to a circus before writing this book, and knocked it out with minimal research (""circus people don't want to talk about their stories...""), the results are as thin as hobo soup. By the author's own account, she saw pictures of depression era circuses in a book and made up a story around them. You never really learn about how a traveling circus worked, except cursory. You never really learn about the railroad and life on the rails. The end just drops off, too many threads unresolved. Considering the potential behind the material, the book falls very short in many regards. Sarah, fiction is not like ""Technical Writing"", you need to spend the time make it believable and engaging. This was a wasted opportunity to write a great story."
2,Enjoy the read.,"This a book. Written to the end.Way to go. If you make it that far and you didn't wish for the time back, congrats on your five-star review. The rest of you can join us behind the menagerie tent for a smoke.If you're interested in reading something about road shows that's real, dig back to the source material. Read Geek Love if you have the stones. And then write a note to Katherine Dunn for opening the tent flap."
3,Water for Elephants,I think that it was very slow to start and had a lot of places that the story line crept to the point that I wanted to put the book down. The last 1/3 of the book was excellent. I would have liked to seen the first two thirds of the book to have been faster moving.
2,Shocking and graphic,"Life behind the scenes at the circus was crude and inhumane;I will always view it differently! The 90 year old man telling the story reacted the same way I would have...stomach distress. Should be rated R for sexual and other graphic language. I do not reccommend it for sensitive, caring women."
4,"Well, THIS Author Has Obviously Read Sophie's Choice","I was extremely happy with every aspect of this book until, in one of the final chapters, when Uncle Al tells Jacob that August is a paranoid schizophrenic, or as he puts it, a ""paragon schizophonic"". After reading this, there seemed to me to be simply too many similarities with an older novel I read in 2006, William Styron's modern classic SOPHIE'S CHOICE. A beautiful Catholic woman and a handsome Jewish man who fight a lot due to the man's schizophrenia, another younger man who is new to their 'group' who has feelings for the woman...sex...death...the only dfference seems to be the circus setting and the fact that in this, the woman DOESN'T die and ends up married to the new, younger man. A nice book, but not extremely original, at least not in the romantic storyline."
1,Animal Abuse,I managed to read half the book and then couldn't handle reading any more animal abuse. It was the worst I have ever read before. I should have known since it was written about a circus not to read it.
3,Not my favorite,This was a book club pick so I got it. It's not my favorite but it's okay. I don't think I'd ever read it if I had to do it all over.
4,Who knew that the Circus setting could be so compelling?,"A man in a nursing home relives his younger years as a vet for a circus. To this reader, not a very compelling premise, yet once I read the first paragraph I was instantly hooked. By the second chapter, I had grown so attached to the main character that I truly felt for the things that happened to him. The story is told in rich, vivid prose, capturing each character so well that they soon became my friends and enemies, depending on the character. This book addresses a wide range of human experiences in a tasteful manner in which this reader was left in a pensive, awe-struck mood contemplating far more important questions and ideas about human existence. It also needs to be noted that this book is extremely well researched and bases its story around actual happenings in Circus history."
2,Did not meet my expectations,"Im sorry but this book was in a word....dull. It starts strong but about a hundred pages in, it becomes an endurance test and I really had to force myself to finish it."
4,Great Read,"I in all honesty wanted to read this book before ever watching the movie, however, I stumbled into a free movie weekend and it happened to be available. I liked the movie so well that I knew I had to read the book. The book is quite different from the movie, but it is an excellent read. It has everything from love, lust, excitement, despair, and surprise."
5,Terrific Read!,Water for Elephants is a terrific read. The realities of the Depression and life on a train circus are captivating and Jacob's end of life narritive is compelling and poignant. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
5,Best Book I've read this summer!,"This is an absolutely wonderful book. A real page-turner. I loved the way it moved back and forth through time, it's characters,the story-line.. the ending. Don't let the summer go by without reading it. You'll be glad you did! I highly, highly recommend this book."
5,Great but...,"I thought the book had great scenes but I didn't understand why it was a bestseller or why it will become a movie. I was not spellbound, it was not a page turner either I had to take breaks from it."
5,Enjoyable read,"It took a bit to get used to the flashback style of this book, but I very much enjoyed this story and all the characters."
3,Water for elephants,A story of found and lost love. A great read for a rainy day. The movie is great but the book was better
3,Interesting,"Something for adults definitely; very vulgar and excruciating. But other than that, good read, easily sucks you in and leaves you wanting more."
2,Big time-disappointed,Saw the movie first and was excited to read the book next. Very disappointed about the book. The movie carried the story line so much better. The worst thing about the book was the main character. In the movie at least they made him out to be a real hero. In the book he seems like a complete jerk.
3,It's good,"Good book, written nicely, some parts were a little sad for my liking. However I did appreciate the author adding in history and doing her research before writing the book."
4,no read,"I didn't get to read the book, i,m not familar with kindle yet, i couldn't open the book. i don't know what i'm doing"
3,Forgettable,"I was really excited about this book I thought it would be similar to ""The Circus in Winter,"" but I was disappointed. I read it a few months ago and it was one of those books that did not leave a lasting impression on me. Yeah, some of the characters were captivating at the time but nothing that I haven't encountered in other books."
4,Really enjoyed it,The movie came out...I prefer to read the book before seeing the movie...looking forward to seeing the movie now. Usually I always like the book more. This book makes me want to read more novels by Sara Gruen
4,Okay:),Real enjoyed the book I just think some of the words didn't fit the book. Some of the words used were more complex than the actual plot but other than. That it was a good book I really enjoyed it
4,VERY ENJOYABLE,This book was very good. I liked reading from both ages of the main character. The ending was more of a surprise since from the first page I thought it would end completely different!!!
2,somewhat entertaining tale,"The author did her homework on circus life, but that doesn't make her tale credible. She doesn't write convincingly in a male voice, the story is fantasy but not fantastic, the ending doesn't hang together with the rest of the book or tie the book together. I don't understand this book's apparent popularity, but it is an easy read and mildly entertaining."
1,This made me ill.,Buy this book if you enjoy descriptive sex and inhumane treatment of animals. I stopped reading after a few pages. This is not my idea of a good summer read.
5,Love,I love this book. So much better reading it now that I have seen the movie. I give it five stars.
5,Excellent story,I heard to the movie and was interested to see how the book was. Excellent story and ended up renting the movie and it was good but not as good as the book.
4,"Well-written, but graphic adult content.","I liked the book and thought it moved along well. I was invested in the characters, and there were some unpredictable parts. However, some major parts were a little formulaic. I did not expect there to be such graphic adult content. While these parts were short and somewhat humorous, I did not need detailed descriptions of sexual acts or the anatomy of characters. Think a step beyond John Irving. I was able to look past these parts and recommend the book to certain friends who would not be offended by this."
2,I just don't see it,"I know most people loved this book and perhaps my expectations going in were just too high. That being said, I found the book to be a slow read and only mildly interesting. Maybe I just don't have a passionate intrest in circus life. The end was my favorite part, but two or three good pages couldn't save this book for me."
5,One of my favorite reads in years,"For me, this book was like making a dear friend, and then bidding him farewell. I tried to savor this story, but couldn't put it down either. I was so sad when I got to the last page and it was over.I think the other reviews cover the storyline well...and I'm not a fan of giving away endings, but in general, it has vivid character development, authentic to the period and circus era of the depression years... and despite some graphic scenes (which add to rather than take away), it was a great, great read.I suspect it will be hailed as one of summer 2008's top beach reads...and will be on my recommend list to anyone who will listen for a long time to come."
5,Water for Elephants: A Novel,"This book needs to become a movie, with Clint Eastwood playing the elderly man in the nursing home, who reminices about his past. Unique story A+"
3,"Good, but....","Overall, I really enjoyed this book. I wish I could share it with my 12-14 year old children, however. I found the sex to be gratuitous and feel that the same ""flavor"" could have remained without being so explicit.It's a good ""airport"" book, but if you really want to sink your teeth into a book with circus' as the theme, read SPANGLE by Jennings."
2,Disappointed.,"The setting for this book sounded really promising, America in the 1930's, a circus touring the country, an elephant. In addition by the time I got around to reading it the book had become very popular (which I felt indicated it must be a good read). Overall I have to say the book was a letdown. I still feel the idea behind the story and its setting have the potential to make a great book but ultimately Ms. Gruen does not deliver on that potential. I was especially disappointed by the way the Kinko/Walter character changes his attitude towards Jacob seemingly overnight, the way it is written Walter's behaviour just doesn't ring true. The ""love affair"" between Marlena and Jacob is also disappointing, there are several scenes where a good writer would really be able to make you feel the internal conflicts the two characters obviously must be experiencing given their situation but again Ms. Gruen's prose just left me feeling flat."
1,"WFE drinking game--how many ""stares"" in one novel???","If you are irritated by sloppy writing, avoid this book. Ms. Gruen seems to believe that using various forms of the word ""stare"" at every opportunity adds something (profundity? narrative tension? extra paragraph breaks?) to her story. No character can respond to another without staring at him first. The narrator stares when alone. The dog stares. The elephant stares. Where outside of bad novels or badly acted films does everyone stare meaningfully in moments of high drama?Other weaknesses of the plot and characterizations are well-documented in these reviews. If you normally choose well-written prose, do not let someone who loved this book talk you into reading it."
2,Boring and Predictable,I couldn't wait for this book to come out in paperback. I started reading it the moment it came in the mail. I was hopelessly dissapointed with the read. After each chapter I kept thinking something great would happen in the next and it never did. I felt no connection to the characters at all. The big surprise ending was totally unbelievable. The end wrapped up too quickly and neatly. The only thing interesting about the book was the imagery she used to describe the time period and the circus. I have no idea why she chose that title because the elephant is not a major character at all. I did empathise with the older Jacob but found his decision in the end also unbelievable. Don't waste your time. This novel is nothing but a piece of fluff with no substance at all.
5,Everyone should read...Water for Elephants,"This was a very revealing story of how it feels to grow older, live in a nursing home, & be dependent on someone other than yourself. I was hooked from the first, wondering who was bashed in the head, and who did it. The surprising truth came toward the end of the book. Sometimes the story was depressing but the ending was a happy one."
5,Amazing book,"I don't read very often due to kids always needing something, so I wasn't sure how well this was going to go. I got the book & within the first paragraph I couldn't put the book down. I felt like I was in the book & could imagine what it was like. It has 25 chapters altogether & it took me about two days to read it. If you like reading books that you feel like you're in the story read Water for Elephants. It will make you want to see the movie after reading it."
5,Really get read,"I was very pleased with this book. Not the harlequin romance I was expecting, but turned out to be even more. You can't help but fall in love with the relationships Jacob has with Camel, Walter, Rosie and Marlena. The author shows his humanity towards all the menagerie and roustabouts. I read the book before I watched the movie. Which I'm very glad I did. The book takes you on a deeper journey with Jacob at 93 and 23. The movie totally skips over Jacob at the nursing home. They didn't build Jacob at 93 for anyone who'd never read the book to understand him. Had I'd just watched the movie without ever reading the book. I would walk away happy, but in ignorance. I would definitely recommended this book to anyone and would advice to read the book before watching the movie."
3,"Vivid imagery, ok story",The imagery of the circus was incredible. The story of the ninety year old version of Jacob was compelling and touching but I found the actual story of the younger Jacob J. lacking depth and development. Overall it was an ok read and I'm glad I read the book.
4,Water For Elephants,"Excellent book! I enjoyed this read from the first page to the very end. Very well written, interesting characters, and wonderful story line. I cannot wait for the movie to open to see if they will be able to capture this story in film as well as it was written. I highly recommend this book!!!"
5,Beautiful,This is one of the best books I have ever read in my life. It was given to me to read by a friend and I love it so much I plan on purchasing it for myself just to have to read again in the future. You must read this book.
5,Suprisingly good...,"Wasn't sure I was excited about reading a book about the circus, but this was a great story with an easy storyline to follow. My book club enjoyed it!"
5,Very pleased,I am very pleased with the condition of this book. Also it was packaged securely and arrived on time.
4,A great read for 20 somethings to 70 somethings!,"I read this book hearing nothing but good things, and the fact that I never read books about the circus, gave me cause for concern. Never judge a book by its cover, I loved it! The details of circus life are so interesting, along with the plot and characters. A book I will never forget. So good I gave it to my parents to read, both in their 60's and they loved it as well."
2,"Forgettable, poorly written","I had really high expectations for this book because I'd heard so many of my friends rave about it. Although I did read the entire book and found aspects of the story interesting, the clunky writing style was distracting. I hardly remember anything about it now (I read it in 2008). It reminded me of Nicholas Sparks' books, so if you like him, you may like this as well.When I've read well-written romantic books (Bel Canto, The Time Traveler's Wife, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, The Book Thief, etc.) and recall them years later, I'm still able to access the emotions that were stirred up in me while reading. When I think back on Water for Elephants, I feel nothing.I felt about it like I have about a few other books (Dan Brown's, for example), that if the author had created the plot and had a more skilled writer bring the story to life, it could have been amazing. As it is, I do not recommend Water for Elephants."
3,Just a bit more,"Don`t get me wrong. I liked this book. A lot. Sadly for me though there was so much effort put into the male characters, there wasn`t much left for the female characters. The elephant was the best written women in the bunch!"
5,Loved it...,"I can read about any subject if the characters are compelling, and I am amazed at the rich characters in this novel. Historical fiction at its finest!"
5,Great and different read,"This book was great but very different from what I normally read. With that being said I really enjoyed it! Some of the parts involving the animals disturbed me, I'm a total animal lover, but I had to remind myself that that was reality back then and despite those parts, I really loved it. Rosie was by far my favorite character and the ending was great. I hope the movie doesn't butcher this beautiful story."
