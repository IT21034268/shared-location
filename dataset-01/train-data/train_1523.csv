4,"Panasonic Headset, could be more comfortable...but","I like it when I am busy and need my hands, I wish the head part was softer but hey what do you want for the price, the sound is great and does get rid of the noise others hear...pretty good"
4,Perfect for business use,I bought this headset to use with my Panasonic cordless phone for my home-based business. Earphone clarity is great. The microphone is clear on my recorded wav. files. Comfortable fit and it's adjustable. I would recommend this headset.
4,Works As Advertised!,"I recently purchased this headset on Amazon and it works as advertised so far. It's a basic headset, nothing special. I'm using it for my cordless Panasonic Dect 6.0 landline phone. I've had it for about two months and there are no problems at all. The sound quality is great. It doesn't have noise cancellation, but that doesn't seem to matter much so long as I am in an environment where there isn't a whole lot of background noise. The headset is adjustable so that you can wear it on both the right and left ears and the boom mic bends easily so that you can adjust the distance of the mic to and away from your mouth. I have no complaints at all and it is easily worth the $14 I paid for it."
4,It works...,"Great value. Works like a champ with our Uniden phone. Clear sound inbound and outbound. Nothing fancy, just works like it's supposed to."
1,"Very disappointed, and slow delivery after paying for faster","I've been wanting a headset for when I'm driving, using my Treo phone.I've not been happy with quality of bluetooth sets and ear buds fall out or are too tight. After careful reviewing, bought this.Both I and the other end of the phone have trouble hearing each other.Have tried on my landline and it's okay - nothing execptional.Always find these reviews confusing when 7 people love a product and 3 don't. Maybe I just got a lemon with this particular headset and usually they're excellent???"
1,Broke after a month,"Headband was stiff and unwieldy, arm of mouthpiece didn't bend very well, and I had numerous complaints about my voice sounding 'far away' and tinny a lot of the time.After using it for a month the size-adjusting band simply cracked while on my head, leaving the entire right side (the one with the mouthpiece) to dangle. The only thing keeping it from falling to the ground was a slightly larger bit of plastic at the end of the adjustment track.As I do not favor a headset featuring a large section of duct tape I will be buying another type of headset!"
1,Cord went bad in record time,"The cord on this thing is VERY thin and the strain relief is the typical plastic molded-end that on thin cord like this is usually pretty ineffective-- and sure enough after a couple months use the cord is now so noisy I'm looking for a better made alternative. This is a VERY cheaply made item, if you need a headset you will use a lot try to find something a little more robust..."
1,Not a good experience,"For some reason (obviously some customers didn't have this problem), the other party was mostly inaudible with this headset, and they couldn't hear me well either. Like someone else said about another panasonic headset, it reduced the volume by at least 50%, meaning I was lucky if I could piece a few words together. I tried it with a Panasonic KX-TG2730 and I simply had to toss it in the trash. It was unusable."
1,Pass on this,"Got this with a 2-line Panasonic phone, because it was a ""recommended"" accessory and I needed to replace an older Plantronics set. Headset comfort is extremely subjective, of course, but I found this one difficult to wear for an extended period. Just didn't ""feel right"". This was the first of two headsets I've bought recently, the other one, a newer Plantronics, had an impedance mismatch with the phone but was also uncomfortable. As I said in another review, when you're tethered to one of these for 10 hours or more a day comfort becomes a big deal. Maybe there are some things you just can't shop for mail order, at least without trying them out in person first."
2,"Fits great, works lousy","I purchased this headset with the Panasonic cordless phones. I thought ""same manufacturer, it'll work great.""Wrong.The headset feels great. The mic stays close by my mouth without being intrusive, the speaker stays over my ear.You can even hear the person you're talking to.The problem is there is a loud hum that is entirely too distracting to allow.I can't use the headset. So I have thrown my money down the toilet on this one.Sad, Panasonic usually makes quality products."
1,Panasonic headset,Very disappointed in the headset. It was used 3 times and the mic stopped working and had to be sent back. Waste of postage.
2,It died after eight months!,"At first, this phone seemed like a terrific value. I read all the reviews, and it seemed like a solid pick. And it was. I work from home and use a headset every day, so this is a must-have for me. After four or five months, I started to occasionally get static on the line, which I could fix by wiggling the plug that goes into the phone jack. After eight months, there was so much static on the line that I couldn't hear anything else. I replaced the headset with another model and the problem is completely gone.So it looks like this product is only good for several months of use. If you're looking for a longer lasting model, spend a little more money and try something else. (Unless that's how long headsets are supposed to last?)"
3,OK headset,"This headset is OK for the price. The loudspeaker part is fine, but the microphone is only OK, so my voice is soft and sounds a little different (but still understandable) for the person on the other end. If you want a better headset, I suggest paying a little more and getting the Plantronics M175. I have both of these headsets, and I think the M175 is worth the extra cost."
3,not very comfortable,This is a nice head set with good sound but I do not find it very comfortable. The price was right and it does have a pretty long cord compared to many head sets. I went from a more expensive metal set and wear it an average of 3 hours a day so I may be a bit pickey.
5,"Clear, Convenient, Noise-free Communication",The best thing about the KX-TCA60 hands-free headset is the boom microphone. You can place it close to your mouth in noisy environments so your listener can hear you easily over the noise. You can place it farther from your mouth to mute your breathing when you're in a less noisy environment. You can place it over your head or beneath your chin to get it out of your way when you're not using it. No one has told me that they were having trouble hearing me when I've used it.
5,Money maker,"I worked for an online company selling insurance, among other things, and this headset was perfect. Clear sound both hearing and speaking. I had to take a test and the lady said the microphone quality was good."
1,"Feedback ""hum"" after one month of use","I wish I could recommend this headset, but it was rather disappointing. I found the volume to be a bit low and would have liked some sort of volume control on the headset to adjust. After several months, it developed a feedback like hum in the background that did not appear on my headset or handset. I will look for something with better performance in the future."
1,no the correct one for the phone,"i wasted my money this cannot be used with wireless phone that i purchase but this was recommended in the bottom, useless"
1,fragile and poor sound quality..,not a very good product...poor sound quality..fragile... volume is very low...chances of this breaking is very high...i would not recommend...
2,Loud Hum,"This headset worked fine for a few months. Sound was nice and loud and clear. But in less than four months it has begun to have a very loud and annoying hum, which is heard by both caller and receiver on the line. It has gotten so loud that I have to trash it and look for another headset. I would not recommend this headset."
4,Good Headset,The headsets work great. Very basic design but sound quality and volume is good and comfortable. They are cheap so I bought 4 of them to leave in the cars and house. The only drawback is they are on the bulky side.
4,Panasonic KX-TCA60 Hands-free headset review,"An excellent product with a foam covered mouthpiece at a very low price. Only disadvantage is the mouthpiece tubing is somewhat short. This means that in order to be heard easily, the earpiece has to be moved away from its proper position making it harder to hear. Even a 1/2 inch longer mouthpiece stem would make a big difference."
2,Made for tall skinny heads,"I can hear better through the headset than through the handset and callers say they can hear me better too. But.....As a tall and slender adult male 6'2, 175 lbs. I usually complain about clothes, devices, etc. being too small. This headset is almost great with one major drawback. Adjusted to the smallest setting the pressure plate (non-earphone) side is JUST above my ear and and squeezes my head uncomfortably tight. If I adjust it any larger to make it looser and stop the ""migraine squeeze"", the pressure plate with its sharp plastic literally cuts into the top of my ear. I wrapped it with mole skin to make it bearable, but I am disappointed."
1,Really crummy microphone,"With 476 reviews, I guess I'm not gonna make much of a difference. But the microphone on this item (both mine and my wife's) is so bad that it's almost useless. I have to practically put the pickup IN my mouth to be heard on many connections. I tried it without the foam cover, but no improvement. My AT&T; speakerphone picks up my voice much better from two feet away than this microphone does from two inches!So, after 5 months of struggling with the microphone touching my lips, I need to give up on these and buy two headsets of a different brand -- heard good things about the $20 Plantronics.Why wasn't this reported in any other reviews? Did we get TWO defective units? Has Panasonic degraded the quality since those reviews?"
4,Be careful.,This product only works with certain wireless phones with a very small phone jack. My rating would be higher if this product had included a conversion cable to change the phone jack to an RJ45 plus so it could also be used with a normal telephone.
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this for home use at my desk. The sound quality was fine while it worked, which ended up being about two months."
2,You get what you pay for...,"What can I say? Its a pretty inexpensive headset, which is a huge plus. However, when the headset came in the mail, I pulled it out of the box and tried it on. It didn't fit real well. That's okay, but then when I got on a conference call, pretty much everyone on the call had a hard time understanding me. I had to take the headset off, and it was much better. I am not sure if I am going to use it anymore...but it was less than a $10 investment..."
2,Together?,Does not work with the item that it sells. Why sell them together? Buy a cordless phone and this item has nowhere to connect.
3,Headset,"I give it about a 7 out of 10. It's ok nothing wonderful but not a piece of junk either. I bought one that goes over the head that is much better, but I don't like it over the head!!"
1,Mine is useless!,"This set was useless from the day I got it. Loud static, but if you giggle it, it can become clearer but no use. It is so cheap that I am not going to bother returning it.You are better off going to the store to make sure you get a good one, instead of having to repackage it to return it. You can return it to the store and get another one immediately."
2,Voice quality doesn't last,"I've had this headset for about a year now, and the voice quality suddenly went kaput! Listerners no longer can understand me because the sound transmission becomes garbled and distorted. What used to be a good headset is nearly worthless and must be replaced. Avoid this headset - it's unreliable."
4,Nice Little Headset For The Price!,I bought this headset because I have a work-at-home customer service position which requires that i have one. This one works fine. It's comfortable to wear for a long period of time. The cushioned ear piece is nice. It DOES have a static tendencies while on some calls (not all and not too often). Everyone has been able to hear me though and I can hear them VERY well. It has a clip on it which I can attach to my shirt so the cord doesn't just dangle in my way. Overall a GREAT headset!
2,Broke within a year,"Whereas this simple headset performed well - good sound quality, great fit etc. it broke within a year. I have a very small head and am very careful with all my things, so I know it wasn't something I did. Unfortunately I had thrown the box and all packaging out so couldn't return the item."
1,Very Disappointed,This headset broke within the the first week I got it... I purchased one for myself and a co-worker of mine for us to use @ work and they both just stopped working. Very Disappointed.
5,Crystal clear,I love this headphone as the sound is crystal clear. It is confortable on the head and ear. I have worked long hours and did not have neck cramp by using this headphone headset.
5,Works well,Came in an easy to open package and was easy to use. I love the way it sounds clear when you talking and the padded ear makes it very comfortable nad you rarely realize it is there.
3,"Not bad, but a little flimsy","I prefer using headsets when I talk on the phone. I find that most of the non-powered headsets are a little bit fragile and tend to break easily, and don't have the greatest sound to those I'm speaking to (seems like volume is a bit low for them). When they break it's usually some obscure part that doesn't affect sound so you can keep using them. Most people say I sound clearer through the handset, but I can carry on most conversations with no complaints about volume, clarity, etc. I've had other brands that I get a lot of complaints about. These will do the trick. The less I have to talk on the handset the better, and these allow me to talk on the headset 95% of the time."
1,"Poor sound quality, everyone complains they can't hear me","I plugged this into my cordless headset and in spite of the microphone being right near my mouth, everyone tells me they can barely hear me! Only when I unplug the unit and talk into the cordless phone can they understand anything I'm saying. Straight to the trash can..."
4,On my third set,"Excellent for the price but does not last longer than a year, at least on my head. The plastic keeps breaking at the base next to the speaker. If you do not mind the aesthetic side, wrap some tape around and it will serve longer."
2,Difficult to return an item,Had a hard time getting a refund...they kept pushing exchanging the item even though I specifically wanted a refund. Finally made it happen after insisting. Should never be that difficult.
1,Inferior product and customer service,"Wire/jack connection shorted immediately, Photolandny did nothing in the way of customer service/support! Product sounded OK prior to the connection issue which rendered it useless."
5,Less than $15 works great,"I've had trouble with other brands in the past. That is probably why when I bought my first KX-TCA60 headset I was skeptical at first. I have found this to be more durable than my other $300 dual ear headset. Yes the sound isn't exactly the same, but it is good enough for a long phone call to mother.This is a great headset to give as a gift also to anyone you talk to on the phone. Shouldn't we all be more in the spirit of giving. The two people that I gave this headset to loved it, and me for giving it to them.(Note: From reading other review you should position the mike once and leave it in place. I have not tested this frailty, but I have dropped my headset and had the cord pulled out of the phone with the headset still working faithfully afterward.)"
5,Just what I wanted,"I love using headsets when talking on the phone, but in the past I have been disappointed with the various headsets I have tried. I bought 2 of these (one for my office one for home) based on the reviews here, and for the first time I am using a headset that is just what I wanted. They are comfortable to use, loud enough, easy to slip on and off, and everyone seems to be able to hear me just fine."
1,Low Quality Product,Until now I've always had great luck with Panasonic products. The microphone quit after just 5 months of light useage. The warranty expired after 90 days. My advice is to spend more money for a poduct that will last.
3,Good Headphones but static,The headphones work fairly well but if you move the connector during a call it causes static which can be heard by both parties. As long as I use the clip to rest the phone on my belt or pocket I'm usually fine to walk around without static. But if I hold the phone in mind hand with the headphones on there usually is static. I haven't tried the headphones with other products so maybe the problem is with the phone and not with the headphones. I can't say for sure.
2,Didn't last 2 weeks,"Within 2 weeks of normal use, sitting at a desk, it began to lose sound quality. The problem is at the jack, I know it's not the phone - I just bought 4 new handsets."
2,You do get what you pay for,"I've owned three of these. The 1st I bought because the price was right, hence the title for this review. The second I bought because I couldn't believe that Panasonic would make a product with a defect like my first one knowingly, that it had to be a fluke. The third I bought because I couldn't afford anything better at the time. My next one will be a different make to be sure.Each of them has had the same failure. The wires leading from the phone to the headset are very, very small, and they break, causing lose of signal and static. At first I thought this was my fault; with my first one I kept catching the cord on various things around the house, and I figured that this abuse must have caused the failure. With the last 2 I've rigged up systems to keep even the weight of the cord from pulling down on the cable. Didn't matter. All of them have failed before a year was out."
5,Excellent Value,"I been using this headset for three years with my Panasonic cordless phone as well as my cell phone (when I am at home). Typically, I use them for a few hours each month. They work amazingly well. The sound quality is excellent and I have never had anyone complain that they had problems hearing me. The only drawback is that if you keep wearing them for a long time (more than one hour or so), they start hurting. If that happens, I usually take them off for some time before putting them on again.In short, they provide exceptional value for your money."
4,Good basic headset,The quality of the headset has been good so far. Only complaint is that the sound cracks a little if you move the phone (a uniden phone) jack (which happens if you move the phone). People I've talked to said I come in loud and clear.
5,good product,The product was very useful for my aunt who is having problems with her hearing. She can just put the headset on and talk on the telephone.
5,Panasonic KX-TCA60,"This product is great. It is hands free and without a dought the best I have used. It is everything it was supposed to be. I use it all the time now, don't know what I would do without it."
3,"Not what I was hoping for, but great","I was misinformed about the type of headset I should order, but instead of using this for business, I use it for my house. I'm able to get things done while on the phone. Makes multitasking a breeze.Conmfortable on your head and can be put on either side. Some noise cancellation too."
1,Unusable,"I had earlier written a positive review of this. I owned one that I used all the the time, and it was great, other than being easily breakable. When that one broke I ordered two more. The two new ones are unusable. I am using it with the same phone, and they look the same, but everyone complains of the sound quality when I try to use it. I'm not sure if something changed in the production of these, but this model here is no good. Everyone says I sound like I'm in a tunnel, and everyone is much happier when I take the headset off. I would avoid this product."
1,Panasonic KX-TCA60 Hands-Free Headset,Panasonic KX-TCA60 Hands-Free Headset with Comfort Fit HeadbandI'm sure this headset may work well but not with the Panasonic phones that they were recommended for. They sound very distant on the other end and volume is very low making them useless. For Panasonic phones I would not recommend anyone to purchase.
5,Best of the genre,Superior headset compared to the many I've tried. More sturdy and comfortable than the rest and inexpensive for its quality.
4,A fine headphone,"I got these because I have found that non-Panasonic headphones don't work well with Panasonic cordless handsets. These do, and are comfortable enough to handle long conference calls. Sound is good, too - a good deal."
4,worked like a charm,these headphones were a gift to free up the hands of a seamstress mother in law... and they did just that. She mussed countless call not being able to hear incoming calls. With the speaker right at her ear she hasn't missed a call since.
4,Excellent price,"Not as snug on my head as some of my previous headsets, but it works well and the cord-length is generous. I bought it along with the Panasonic KX-TG6512B DECT 6.0 PLUS cordless phone with the 2 handsets. This headset is just as good as the $30 Radio Shack one it's replaced."
2,Needs Improvement,This product was bought to attach to my phone set and it has static in it from the head set frequently and is not very comfortable. It does have a good price though and I like the ability to move the mic from one side to the other.
1,"See my other headset reviews, these break easily","We've tried all types and they all after working well initially, break within about a month. We use them in our office and they should be labeled disposable as that is what they are. also the retaining clip opposite the headset always gets caught in your hair...."
1,Silent Mic,"I bought one of these for my work phone as it was cheaper compared to competitors. This turned out to be a complete waste of money. After taking it to work and hooking it up I called my sister to test it, and good thing too! She couldn't hear me at all! Ok, might be a faulty product, I received a new one using Amazon's exchange policy, and guess what? This one had faulty mic as well.I suppose this could potentially have something to do with my phone and/or adapter I was using, but I know the phone itself works fine. Save yourself some money and don't buy this headset."
3,It's going to break at some point,"Yes, this is a very good headset for the money but because of the cheap design it's going to break at some point. You can feel how flimsy it is when you first put it on. Mine broke where the headpiece slides in an out of the earpiece section. I had to duck tape it but it still works."
3,Comfort????,"The sound was OK but not as good as my Jabra behind the ear. I returned this mostly because it was said to be a comfort headset and I expected a very comfortable headset, like I would not even know it was there. Not the case, my head maybe bigger than everyone else. I don't think so, I felt it was tight and uncomfortable. There are other headsets that I have worn that have been more comfortable."
3,Tight!,"It's ok, It just doesn't sit real well on your head, listeners often say they can not hear me, but decent for the money."
2,People have a hard time hearing me,"I have a Panasonic KX-TGA541S cordless phone at home . I work from home frequently and have long meetings. I have not been able to use the headset much because people always complain that they cannot hear me, whenever I use the headset. I hear everyone very clearly though. I am very disappointed. I wish someone could give me tips on something I could do to improve the microphone quality. I tried taking the sponge off the mouthpiece but that didnt work either. Sometimes adjusting the connector in the socket improves the quality ( sometimes people say that they can hear me better after I have twisted the jack in the socket for a while ) but that is just frustrating."
2,Broke after 10 months,"I used this headset just one or two times a day. After only 10 months, the wire that connects the microphone came off so no one can hear me."
3,Kinda Junky Headset,"I've used a number of these and since I bought a set of Panasonic phones at the same time and other reviewers said it worked very well with Panasonic I decided to give it a try. The price was right. Honestly, compared to other headsets I've owned they look cheap. In addition, call quality wasn't good and my callers were much happier when I took the headset off and just used the phone. My guess based on the varied reviews here that quality control made vary on this made in China item. I happened to find a Jabra headset in a drawer that I'm using instead that sounds much better. This headset will probably go to Goodwill as the price doesn't make it worth returning."
2,quits working after a few months,"I've owned a couple of these panasonic headsets. They are comfortable and work well until they quit working. Unfortunately they only seem to last about 6 months then, without warning, you will be able to hear other people, but they won't be able to hear you."
2,"Works Well with Panasonic Phones, but...","This headset works well with Panasonic phones, but I have found that the microphone volume is too low when used with AT&T phones. Callers report that it's hard for them to hear me. Panasonic phones must amplify the input more that comes into the headset jack."
2,"like others here, cell phone problem","Bought new KX-TG155 SK Panasonic phones from Costco, and ordered KX-TCA60 supposedly compatible headset from Amazon (recommended on page 5 of the phone's manual). Works fine in land line mode, but (and here let me say I was forewarned enough by other reviewers) using the cell phone mode, the person on the other end can barely hear. Of the three times I've tried it, once they said they heard other people talking as loud as I was, and I was home alone! Three tests seemed enough aggravation to conclude it's almost worthless in cell phone mode. This morning I called their tech support. The off shore tekkie said he had not heard anything like these reviews state. Suggested I call me cell phone provider to ensure the problem wasn't there. When I said, ""Let's just suppose it's not my cell phone. What would you recommend?"" He finally said the set could be failing. He wouldn't go so far as to use words like 'design flaw'. I gave up."
4,Overall a good headset,"This is my first headset, so I don't have anything in terms of comparison. But overall it seems to work very well. The sound quality is good and I have not had any complaints or comments about how I sound on the other end. The only thing that I don't like is that it does not feel very secure on my head. It is comfortable enough due to being so lightweight, but I am constantly adjusting it and trying to get a better fit. For this reason, I would probably try a different make and/or model if I needed another headset."
4,Seem adequate,"They work. Sound quality is good. I don't have any complaints about the quality of the construction; if they overbuild them, aside from costing more, they get heavy and uncomfortable. If I get more than three years out of them, that will be satisfactory."
2,Very Disappointing,"I spend far too much time on-line. That, coupled with my love of knitting, had me looking for a telephone headset. I had hoped, based on the reviews, that this was that headset. Sadly, it is not. I was able to hear my caller; however my caller was not able to hear me. I am very disappointed."
5,PERFECT EARPHONE FOR HOME USE,"It is very convenient to use earphone when talking on the phone, so you can use your hands if you get busy in the kitchen or in the laundry room."
2,A piece of junk but fits the tiny headphone slot,"This thing is uncomfortable, has a so so microphone, can be a little quiet and I would never buy it again on purpose. The only thing good about it is it is a 2.5 MM jack so it fits the tiny jack on the excellent Panasonic cordless phone. If only this thing has Bluetooth or a regular 3.5 MM headphone jack.You only buy this thing if you have to and I think Panasonic knew that when they designed it."
5,Hands Free Headset Equals Freedom,"This headset was just what I needed at home. It makes multi-tasking so much easier. I feel the sound quality is excellent. The price was right and I use it every day while I am cooking, cleaning or whatever. It's compatible with Panasonic phones but I'm not sure what other phones since I only have Panasonic. It's a great accessory to have if you need to do other things while talking on the phone."
2,Works great but fragile.,I ordered two of these headsets and have been very happy with the fit and sound quality. However I found that others using the headset for the first time may break the unit where the adjustable sliding band meets the ear/microphone section.I ended up taping the break on both sets and they work well.When kids visit I now disconnect the headset.Update 8/12Both headbands snapped. Duct tape works temporarily. Ordered a different headset.
4,Panasonic KX-TCA60,"A super great value for the money, if you want a top of the line bells and whistles unit then you should pick something else. I love it for the value and ease of use just plug it in and that's it, not batteries and the cord is very long which make it nice to use as well."
4,Works but need a little mod,"Sits on my head fine and comfortably. One little issue was the spongy mic boom had to be bent closer to my mouth so that the listeners can hear me or it will sound muffled. Other than this little mod, this works great and clear on a landline phone."
1,Buyers beware,This headset was listed as an additional item that could be purchased with the AT&T wireless phone system I was buying on Amizon.com. So I figured for $10 why not buy it? It did not work with the phone system I purchased from Amazon or anything else I own. So I stuck with a headset that I will never use. Buyers beware.
3,Not so good for home office use,"I ordered one, then two more after enjoying hands-free use of my cordless phones. Sound quality was great (both listening and talking). Over time, however, each headset began symptoms of poor wiring. I could hear fine, but those with whom I was speaking indicated that I was fading in and out. I am through my second headset in the 18 months since I bought them. The symptoms improve if I don't move (but that defeats the purpose of hands-free, doesn't it).I might choose to just replace each one every 9 months, but I'm not sure when my speaking starts to fade. Friends and family will let you know pretty quickly, business meetings aren't so informative. I'm looking for something with a little more durability."
1,Worked great for a week...,"This product worked great for the first week. After that I could still hear people, but they could no longer hear me..."
2,You get what you pay for.,"Well this product got great reviews, but it is already cutting out and I've used it less than a month. I guess you get what you pay for. I'm disappointed that the reviews were so misleading. I have no trouble spending more for good quality which is what I will have to do now."
2,HANDSFREE HEADSET,Used for less than a week and it broke. Audio features failed in less than a week. Not worth sending back or trying to get a refund.
1,DO NOT BUY,"TOOK IT OUT OF THE BOX, PLUGGED IN PHONE, DIALED A NUMBER, JUST HEARING THE LOW VOLUME WHEN THE PHONE RANG ON THE OTHER END, I KNEW IT WAS GOING BACK. I USE AN LG610V05 PHONE. MAYBE IT WILL BE BETTER WITH ANOTHER BRAND PHONE."
3,Hands-free phone headset,Product works fine. The phone must still be attached to you and the wire at times gets in the way.
1,Microphone quits working,"I purchased two of these and after a few months of use, both microphones quit working so the caller could not hear my voice. Since this happened to both, I think the product is faulty! Don't purchase would be my advice."
1,For people with miniture heads,the set did not come close to fitting over a normal size adult head.I had to return it immediatley
1,Worthless,I purchased for monthly conference calls in my home office. I tried it for just a couple of them & everyone complained - they couldn't hear me & I tried the microphone in every which way I could. Glad it didn't cost much. Junk
2,OOPS! My mistake. Be careful if ordering this!,"I didn't pay enough attention to this item - it is not a standard headphone jack but rather a mini-plug. It fits an XBox controller, but not my Droid phone. Since it didn't come with an adapter of any sort I won't get any use out of it. I like the design of it, and it was purely my mistake in not noticing the plugin size. If you are considering this headset for your phone, just be sure the stereo plug is right for your equipment!"
1,Doesn't fit,"I bought this headset because my cell phone speakers broke, but this headset does not fit into a headphone jack on either a phone or a laptop."
2,Didn't have a chance,Amazon free shipping program is so poor I actually never received the product. Therefore I didn't have a chance to use it.
2,Very Uncomfortable,I was very disappointed by this headset. Very uncomfortable. I hope the trashman enjoys them.
2,Not what I wanted to buy,"Not what I wanted to buy. I looked and looked for a specification for the type of conector on this headset, and it was NOWHERE to be found. Since the description said ""telephone headset"" I was dumb enough to asume that it would actually fit into a landline telephone... well it didnt, this is a dinasour size cellphone headset.People please... its not hard to add the conector type to a description.... TRRS conector, THATS THE TYPE OF CONECTOR IT HAS. IT DOES NOT FIT A LANDLINE TELEPHONE, ONLY SOME CELLPHONES WITH THIS TYPE OF RECEIVER FOR TRRS.Thank you for an absolutely useless item.Another bad experience with amazon.com thanks to a poor product description and images.clap clap clap."
2,"Not a total waste, but won't connect to my computer","I bought this intending to plug it into my computer. No, it doesn't fit those ports. Fortunately there is a proper jack on my desktop phone, and the product works with that. So, not a total waste."
5,Very functional,I have found this to be a very functional and sturdy product. The sound is good and as a matter of fact no one knows Im using it. That in and of itself tells what a good value this is. Its inexpensive and works very well.
1,"Do not bother, not worth it","I truly can not believe how bad this headset is and I have no idea why it got good reviews. After about two days of using it, a horrible background buzzing noise set in and I could not hear a thing anyone was saying to me. I threw the headset out and called our phone guy who told me to buy a Plantronics one instead. I did and so far it's working fine.The worst part is that as I was cleaning house I found another old headset I'd bought a couple of years ago. That too had terrible sound so I realized I have twice bought the same lousy Panasonic headset. Not sure how it happened. I guess they had good reviews and the price was right. Please don't make the same mistake I did."
1,Started buzzing noise after only 1 day,Only used this one day (maybe 5 hours total) when it started making a loud buzzing sound that could be heard by both the caller and the receiver. Returning it for a refund.
2,"Poor sound, poor fit","I bought this for my home office and was hopeful since I like Panasonic products, but was disappointed because while I was using this headset, I found I could hardly hear the other person, and that there is a constant background noise which drove me crazy. I ended up buying the Plantronics model, and spend quite a bit more, but I really need a corded headset that allows me to hear clearly. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is the ease of set up: Plug in and go, no problem there. Otherwise its really poor quality for those who will be wearing it all day at work."
2,Not that great,The mic seems to be poor at picking up sound because people on the other end of the line can't hear me very well. The ear piece is uncomfortable.
4,pretty good considering price,"Usually you get what you pay for but not here, for a very inexpensive headset I got multiple uses....my cell phone, my home phone, my hunting radio and I'm sure many more.Good quality, good sound, good headset!"
2,poor quality out of the box,"I have tried this with a Panasonic phone and with a 3rd party branded phone that has a compatible adapter. For sound, I can hear, but it is muffled. When I tried speaking, it kept cutting out, and I had to go back to the handset.I find it unlikely that this is a Panasonic-branded headset. There is nothing printed on it indicating a part number, no instructions (though probably not necessary,) etc. However, this is no surprise for the price."
2,does not work with the phone,"Amazon suggested I purchased this for use with the Panasonic cordless phone. It didn't occur to me that there would be no way to connect it to the phone. Why does Amazon suggest items, when they don't even go together?I sent the item back, but only received a partial refund.Lesson learned - don't buy suggested items unless you research them first.The headset looked great, and I would have loved to be able to use it."
3,All in All -- good buy,"You'll need to be careful, or you'll easily break it in two. I use it every day so it was only a matter of time. Otherwise, perfectly useful for hands free use. It even works on my cell phone!Update: I've gone through 3 of these in a year. They're cheap and snap easily. I would reduce my rating to one star."
4,cheap and good,"this headset is good for the price. anyone looking for a cheap durable headset should look at this one. the speaker is flexible also and it makes it easy to place right where you need it to be. it does seem a little big, but not so much as to make this a bad buy."
4,Mostly good...,"This is my second time buying this headset. The first one's headband broke after about 1 year's worth of use. The only issue I've had intermittently with this one is that my volume sounds really low to the person on the other line. Other times, there are no issues and my voice is perfectly fine. There is also no problem hearing others clearly.Overally, it's a pretty good headset. I bought it the second time around, so that says something."
3,kx-tca60 headset,"I have my new KX-TCA Hands-free head set and with some calls it is adequate. It fits comfortably.Many of the people I speak with speak softly and this head-set seems to soften or muffle the words more so that I cannot understand the speaker even with the volume is turned up. I have had to resort to my old, less comfortable set."
5,Nice headset,This headset works great. The sound quality is very good. I have a friend that speaks very softly and I could hear her just fine on the phone. My last pair broke and it was really a pain to have to talk with it up to my ear for extened periods of time. No complaints.
1,Nothing but complaints,I bought this three months ago based on the good Amazon reviews. It was fine for a couple of weeks and then I received a lot of complaints from the people I talked to that I was too soft or I sounded like I was under water. I would never recommend this headset to anyone!
2,Microphone does not work w Nokia E71,"I would be pleased with this if my phone was more compatible with it. It's comfortable, secure when gardening, but, I must hold my phone's mic to my mouth when speaking if I want to be heard. The Nokia E71 informed me to use it's mic as soon as the headset was plugged in. I still prefer using this headset to having the phone next to my head. I've had it only a few hours so, I can't speak to durability. Frye's matched the Amazon price."
2,basic headset,"I have just begun using this item. One feature I wish it has is a volume control. I have also found that while I can hear great on it, the person on the other end doesn't always hear me the best unless the microphone is very close to my mouth. It is comfortable to wear and worked well with my phone. I purchased this item for occasional home use. If I were using it more frequently I maybe would have gone with a different model. Seems to be a good value for the money.update - I quickly grew to dislike this model. I had more and more difficulty with the person I was talking to hearing me. Practically had to have the microphone in my mouth for them to pick up on my words. I would not recommend at this point and have stopped using this product."
2,Too quiet,"Yes, it is comfortable and hands free. It worked with my Panasonic phone, but it was too quiet. My callers could not hear me, they complained of a buzz. I pitched it and purchased a cheap Plantronic headset instead."
2,Worked great until it broke a few months later,This worked great for the money until it broke a few months later. You pay for what you get.
4,Reliable Hands Free Headset,"I love the hands-free headset. It is comfortable, there's no static and you can hear very well and others can hear you just find."
1,Did not work!,"Just received this in the mail a few days ago. It is horrible and doesn't work at all. I can hear caller, but they hear complete silence. I read most of the reviews and they were good, but this product so far stinks! I am going to see how the returns work...we'll see."
1,Never worked,"I was looking to replace my basic hands-free headset that stopped working after about two years. The Panasonic never worked. Plugged it into several phones and no luck. Ah well, $9.57 down the drain."
2,Good but not great,"I find these to be both good and bad. The sound quality is good, if not excellent. However, the way they are made I find them difficult to adjust. They don't fit on my head comfortably and I cannot get the boom microphone to locate in the proper position relative to my mouth. The product just doesn't seem to be thought out well. But the sound quality I find good and as far as I can tell, others hear me well."
3,"Nice Headset, plastic wears out and breaks over time","I bought this in June 2008 and again in June 2010, after the plastic headset broke. I do have a large head, but still...The plastic that makes up the headset has a structural design flaw, and if you use it regularly (I do) it will eventually wear out. I am now looking for yet another headset. I may have to get something different this time. Nice headset until it breaks."
1,poor call,bad call quality when using it ... it is junk i my book ..try something else I would not recommend nor buy again
1,No audio feedback,"When I speak into this headset, there is no audio feedback to the earpiece. This is essential so you can hear what you are saying. It is like a deaf person speaking. They can't tell what they sound like so they sound a little strange. This headset is the same experience. It is a huge technological oversight in my opinion. Telephones have always had feedback. I can't believe they made this mistake."
3,Wish it actually had the 3.5mm connector I was told it did.,Wrong size of connector; something in the ad said it would connect to cell phones but it comes with a 2.5mm connector instead of the 3.5mm connector needed.
4,Fine for the price,"Comfortable corded headset. Good sound. Doesn't last forever, but at the price easy to replace. Perfect match with Panasonic cordless landline phone."
3,Good but fragile,"I have purchased a number of these headsets in the past. (Panasonic has had a number of very similar models). They all work well and are comfortable. I personally rarely use the phone without one of these headsets.They are however fairly fragile. Usually, after a while, the electric cord leading to the hear piece gets lose and disconnected (for instance if you drop the phone while taking).I guess this is the reason I keep buying them. Panasonic could probably build them better, ... but then may not sell as many."
5,"Great clarity, comfort, price. Planning to buy one more.",Love the Sound quality and comfort this headset offers. Spend 50% of my day on calls and this has been a blessing so far. Planning to buy one more.
3,"Basic, does the job, a little bit confusing","Works, no need of batteries. People hears me well, I hear all the people.The phone is confusing. DIFFICULT to hang up a phone call. You need to hang up twice to work. Several time my calls continue without me noticing them. This is not good.Simple technology that works, but definitively needs to be deprecated for a better one."
3,Panasonic headset,"It's OK, but not as good as I think it ought to be. Apparently it doesn't sound great on the other end, and sometimes I have to take it off to hear soft-talkers. I'm a little hard of hearing, but this headset does not help in that regard. However, on balance, I like it because I can talk hands-free while computing. It's worth the price I paid for it; if I didn't have one I'd buy it again."
3,Good headset.. unless you want to use it while driving,"Listening quality is excellent. I would hear everything clearly with my volume set to 1 out of 5. This is by far the best hearing experience I have had in a headset. It is not necessarily the most comfortable thought, but your ear quickly gets used to it.Speaker quality is top of the line. It will pick up your voice very efficiently. It is so good that it also picks any other noises. The main reason I bought this headset was to speak while driving. It proves to be annoying while driving, everybody will complain they can't effectively listen to me because they hear too much noise.Bottom Line:If you need an inexpensive headset for use in an office or any other noise controlled environment, go for it. I still think the noise pickup could have been worked better."
3,works fine,"Delivered within expected time frame. Performs as advertised. Unfortunately, it does not work with Razor smart phones. now just sitting on a shelf. Oh well!"
2,Not comfortable for smaller heads,"This product has great sound quality, both listening and speaking. The one downside to it is that it's not fully adjustable for those with smaller heads. We bought this for use by the entire family and found that the sizing adjustments available do not adjust small enough. As a result, it fits loosely for younger people or those with a smaller head size."
1,Terrible headset,I read all of the great reviews & ordered two of these headsets. I am now wondering if I have the same product that so many wrote glowing reviews for. The sound is not good & the the quality of the microphone is terrible. I have tried to use them for work but had to abandon them & hold the phone because the call quality was so bad.
2,Sounded great for a week then people complained they could not hear me,I was very happy with this initially. I could hear and people reported I sounded very clear. But Pretty quickly people reported that my voice was very faint and they could not hear me well. I will try another brand.
4,Make sure! It is 2.5mm jack!!,If you want to use this for your NOTEBOOK? please make sure to purchase the 2.5mm female to 3.5 male adapter!!!I didn't really pay my attention it is 2.5mm.Quality? not too bad!
4,Good but --,"Quality is good! Vendor shipped super fast!! Nice!Upon reciept ,,unit is ok for car noise,,yet picks up back ground noise easily.I tried varying the microphone positions still get some noise when talking.I gave it a 4 ,,,needs noise suppression somewhat,, but ,,when sitting still in the car-- nice!Outside of the car--excellant,,,light,,,manuverable, good quality, does as advertised.Even better -cheap with good construction!Lets give this a 4 .. no volume control,,no bass or treble no controls."
5,Awesome!!!,"How did I ever get things done before while on the phone. Now I find myself talking to people while I cook or clean, because my hands are free. I love it a lot. Makes my life a lot simpler."
2,Doesn't last,I've bought 3 of these and they never last for more than 3 months at a time. The sound starts to go and then becomes on and off. You have to play with the jack and not move it or you won't be able to hear person on other end. Good price but not worth replacing every few months. Pay a little more and get Plantronics headset.
2,Needs work,Earpiece is too small for an adult. Plastic headband is sized for a child and is uncomfortably tight even when expanded fully.
5,"Reliable, inexpensive","Works well, and is priced right. No problems with cell phone or cordless phone use."
3,Too tight!,"this headset works just fine with our wireless phone handsets, volume is good, mic is flexible. But it hurts to wear it, the headband is very small. I have an average sized head and it is very tight on my head. So it hurts to wear it over the head, & b/c it's so tight, the earphone is pushed hard into the ear, which is also very uncomfortable. Wish you could try these on before buying."
3,OK Product,"It is fairly comfortable. Sound is excellent. Feels really cheesy. Makes me think it will break if I look at it wrong. Also, it really messes my hair up."
5,Highly Recommended,I just started working from home and needed a headset to be able to work hands free. I purchased a GE headset from a retail store for $24.99 and it doesn't work half as good as the lesser expensive Panasonic. Needless to say I will be returning the GE headset. I actually am going to order another Panasonic KX-TCA60 for my other phone so both of my phones in the house are hands free. The sound is crystal clear on both ends. Earpiece is very comfortable to wear. I would highly recommend this product.
1,Not quality,"Didn't last long at all. Went scratchy first, then eventually stopped working. Don't recommend. I used it with Panasonic phones which are great. But need a different headset."
4,works great,"Bought two of these, one for me, one for my son. They fit decently enough, and the mic pickup is great compared to what I had (built in to NB). No complaints. works great for windows hands free application on my machine, also does superbly for my magic jack"
1,Only worked for 1 month,"Pros: Headset is comfortable. Call quality on the headset was very good for first several weeks of use.Cons: After approximately 4 weeks of use, call quality while using the headset diminished. Adjusting the 2.5mm jack helped improve quality. By the 5th week of using the headset, people on the other end of calls could no longer hear me. Adjusting the jack didn't make a difference.Overall: The product only functioned properly for 4 weeks. I would not recommend purchasing."
4,"Works, and I can wear it for hours","It's quite comfortable, and for the money works rather well.The only thing it's missing is a volume control, which I do miss."
4,"it works, average sound, lack of controls","using this with a uniden cordless phone setlike the headset - quite comfy except for the earpiece (a bit small and cushion padding not very soft)sound in and sound out are both okay - reasonable use in office environmentcable is long enough (maybe a bit too long, but just need to tie it up)lacking - answering button, volume control button"
5,Great headset at a great price,I liked this headset so much I bought a second one. The sound quality is clear (both for me and the person I'm talking to) and it fits comfortably. It is the kind of headset you can use for a 4 hour conference call and not develop pain in your ears. I highly recommend it.
2,"Sound too low, no mute.","The sounds is just too low. No volume control, and no mute either. I knew I shouldn't have deviated from the Plantronics. Placed order for Plantronics after this... very disappointing."
3,Not the best headset,"I can definitely tell the difference between headset volume and handset volume. Listeners ask me to speak louder. Satisfactory for the cost, but should be better on volume."
4,Headset is comfortable,The headset works and is comfortable. Have no negative comments. Worth the money I paid.
2,Mic not good,Mic not good. Many on the calls could not hear my voice clearly. Finally bought another headphone.Not using this anymore.
4,great,"awesome price and works great, it could use a volume control. I didnt give it a 5 due to lack of volume. Really Recommend it!"
1,DON'T DO IT!,"I ordered this even though I read some of the bad reviews, and now feel like an idiot, because though I can hear everyone fine, they all tell me I sound far away and fuzzy. Money DOWN THE DRAIN."
1,Wish i hadn't bought 1 let alone two,People I call can't hear me and the foam earpiece keeps coming off.Don't bother with this. I will buy another brand.
5,hands free,"Makes being on the phone so easy while being busy with laundry, cooking, children, ect. Yes, if you need a free hand get one!"
2,Barely usable,"It works, barely. The headphone volume is very weak, but usable. However, the person at the other end cannot understand me unless I scream. The mic is not sensitive enough, and the headphone isn't much better."
3,it is fine.,"ok to use on regular basis, one thing though, you need to remove the microphone sponge, some time people has hard time to hear me from the other end, so I just move that piece and it sounds fine."
1,Poor quality,"When I use this headset, the party on the other end cannot hear me clearly. I should really return it since I haven't used it since my first test of it."
3,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,THEY ARE CHEAPLY MADE WITH BELOW AVERAGE SOUND QUALITY. CANT EXPECT MUCH FOR THE PRICE. BUT THEY DO WORK FINE AND I STILL USE THE ONES I BOUGHT.
3,not as good,"We have purchased this product in the past and have been very pleased, this must be a bad batch, we have had problems with static and the jacks do not seem to be working on our phones. We really like this headset, but would be hesistant to purchase again."
1,Tossed in the trash,"I work from a home office and am on the phone all day, every day. I always use a headset. My guage for a quality set is the feedback I get from the people I talk to...this set was tossed in the trash. People were not able to hear me or would complain that I sounded very far away..."
2,Quality Matches Price,"I ordered this item almost 7 months ago. The sound quality was not ideal to begin with, but you can expect that considering the price. The earpiece is comfortable and the piece can be adjusted easily. Daily use took its toll though. About a month ago the sound started to fade in and out. Seems to be a problem with the jack that hooks into the phone. No matter how much one pays for a product, it shouldn't go out within a few months of use."
2,"crackle, crackle",I bought several of these because I had a panasonic that I used before and loved it. This one however leaves much to be desired. When you plug it in you have almost no volume and the sound crackles everytime anyone talks. It is terrible. I thought perhaps it was just a bad one but they were all like that. What a waste of money.
2,speaker to loud and mic to quiet,No volume control on headset. Way too loud even with phone volume all the way down. Put wad of tissue in earhole to make it usable. Microphone does not pick up voice well. People keep asking to repeat what I am saying. This was not a problem with other headsets in past.
1,Its garbage - Don't listen the reviews,"I followed the reviews here and ordered one. The build quality is terrible. If you move the cord, it creates a ton of static - so bad, callers couldn't even hear me.I returned it minutes later."
5,Excelente calidad de sonido,La calidad del sonido de estos audífonos es excelente y el micrófono transmite sin interferencia; incluso al utilizarlo en las extensiones de nuestro pansonic KXTG4000b se dismiunye la interferencia cuando se recibe o hace llamadas desde una posición alejada de la base (mejora la recepcion).
2,"Purchased June 7, 2010.......","Passed away November 7, 2012........and I understand I got off cheap.Some inexpensive stuff is just str8up crap. If I knew this was the case, I'd have been happy to pay more."
3,get what you pay for,"I bought this for my wife because she said she wanted one. I think she used it twice, dont think she likes it. It works ok nothing great but it was very in-expensive so no big deal."
2,Hard to hear and no mute,I have been using this for less than a month and I am about to order a new headset. It is very hard to hear my customers and when I turn the volume up on the phone there is a ton of white noise. This is one of those items where you get what you pay for is in effect. Spend the extra money and get a better quality headset.
1,"Doesn't fit, doesn't work","Supposed to be useable by an Avaya phone. However, the cord must be inserted into the bottom of the phone and the cord protrudes so the phone does not lie flat (raised 1/2"" resting on phone jack). I also tried a phone call. I could hear, but the microphone was dead, so the other party could not hear me."
4,Looks robust and works as expected,"I used to have a collapsible Panasonic headset which was invaluable. So when it finally fell apart 3 years later I was keen to replace it.I decided on this model because of the price. I figured Panasonic is a good brand and this is less than half the price of most, so I bought 2.The sound quality is good and it has a solid feel. The only thing I don't much like is the foam protector on the microphone. It makes the headset look a bit cheap. However it's very comfortable and the sound quality is good. I have high hopes for this one lasting many years."
3,"work well, don't last","I've had two of these headsets now. The first one lasted over a year, but the second one only lasted about a month. Honestly, I can't be sure that the phone isn't partly at fault as it does seem to be the connection that causes the problems. However, the first one also had other wiring issues. They are really GREAT while they last - the sound is good, it's comfortable, and I simply love being able to talk on the phone hands-free. Makes doing dishes into a treat rather than a chore!"
1,Breaks esaily,"I bought this product with great anticipation and sadly mine was broken within 3 weeks. I am a heavy phone user so there was a lot of stress on the product; however, this should be able to take that kind of activity and it FAILED."
4,Works fine,"This works well with our Panasonic phone, a KX series.I can hear perfectly, but I have to make sure the microphone is close to my mouth, or I sounded distant to others."
4,good value,"I have owned many phone headsets, as I find them invaluable when engaged in conversation where both hands are preferable to one. This was the first headset that had good audio for the person at the other end of the phone. The fit was typical of all headsets with a boom style mike. It does not have an inline mute, as some other headsets do. I bought it as a back-up, but it meets my needs so well that I am currently using it. Great price!"
3,Decent,"This is a decent single ear headset for the price. For me personally, I prefer a headset with two ear pieces because it's hard for me to hear (but those are harder to find). This one doesn't fit my head - the band is quite big, so if you have a big head these will work good for you."
5,Panasonic KX-TCA60 Hands-Free Headset with Comfort Fit Headband,"I love the headset. I am extremely hard of hearing and it puts sound directly into my ear, minimalizing surrounding noise. I have one on every phone in the house and one for my cellphone. They are so affordable that I buy several at once and keep extras as back-up."
2,Noisey,Originally purchased the Panasonic KX-TCA430 for my xbox 360 and was Very Pleased! I bought the Panasonic KX-TCA60 mistakenly thinking it was the same model. It is almost the same. The cabling on this TCA60 is stiffer and produces more noise crackling when plugged into an xbox 360 controller. I tested this on multiple xbox controllers with the same noisey result.Conclusion: Purchase the Panasonic KX-TCA430 instead.
5,Panasonic KX-TCA60 Hands free Headset,"The Panasonic KX-TCA60 Hands Free Headsets arrived quickly and undamaged. The headsets work very well. I prefer the to the more expensive ones. They are inexpensive, and when they start ""crackling"" due to the abuse that they are subjected to, I do not feel bad about replacing them. I usually buy Four (4) at a time. I do recomend these Head Phones."
4,I got 2,My wife spends a lot of time on the phone.I think her neck was about to fall off.So I decided to buy her this set and the price seemed so good that I purchased 2 for the house.No complaints at all. Works pretty good.Note: You can't control the volume except from your phone and you can't hear yourself thru the head phones but every body on the other side says we sound clear to them.No more neck aches.For the price can't do better.
5,"Comfortable, good sound quality, great price","I have used the competitors (forgot the name) headset for about a year, lost the foam ear piece and finaly broke the plug. I was fine with that one, but for about half the price wanted to try the Panasonic. It is a little heavier, so feels more solid and more comfortable as the padding is thicker. I use it with my cell phone while driving and the sound quality is excellent. No reason to spend more. This is a no frills unit that is solid and does the job well."
4,Useful product with all basic features required,"I like this headphone as it has all basic features required. No fancy stuff, just plain headphones that worked as you expect.On cons side, plastic is bit cheap"
3,so so,"Price is ok I guess. It works with my Uniden cordless phone. Another similar set I have on hand does not work with it.Callers say I sound ok on the other end, and while I can hear callers ok I cannot hear myself talk through the earphone. I'm not sure if it is supposed to work this way or not.It is too tight on the head. It could use a volume control. It kinda looks stupid with the huge mic ball at the end. If had to do all over, I think I would have looked for something with an inline volume adjustment (my phone comes through TOO loud on it) and an unobtrusive mic end.I bit on this 'cause of the price and the enormous amount of reviews. Too many to read through. Amazon should start deleting the oldest reviews as product materials change through their life span, and some degrade their quality over time, but the reviews remain, often skewing the overall ratings with past postitive reviews when the product is currently different."
1,"On my Panasonic cordless phone, no one can hear me clearly","On my Panasonic cordless phone, even if I place the microphone right up to my mouth, my words are truncated. Works fine with my old Uniden cordless phone, and also works with my Verizon LG cell phone.But for Panasonic -- a piece of junk. Buyer beware. Invidious, as this headset is produced by the same company that produces the phone itself."
2,"OK at home, not in a noisy car",Works well in a quiet environment. Fits iphone with an adaptor cable changing 5.5mm to 2.5mm. Impossible for anyone to hear anything when calling from a car. FYI.
4,Product works AA!,"Product works as it should and no assembling is done.Dislike is that it fits a little loose or not tight enough for it not not move or fall on my face. Great for when sitting down but not for walking around with it.Recommended this product to working collegues, friends and familiy members."
4,Good product,"I don't use them very often but they are still working when I need them and it looks like so far they are working fine. For this price, they are just fine."
4,"I would give it 5 stars, I'm sure, if I could use it, however, it doesn't work with my phone system.","My phone system doesn't have a port to pug it into. If it did, I.m sure that I would like it."
4,Very handy,Bought this along with the Panasonic phones and love it. Great for use on the phone chasing & carrying a toddler around!
2,Mediocre at Best..,"I bought this for the same reason that everyone else does - so that I can be on a call and still take notes, etc. The fit of the headset is a bit snug and the adjustment does not help a lot. Ear pad is covered in some sort of 'pleather' material that is warm when on the ear for any extended period. I am sure this will not be very comfortable in the summer months. My only frame of comparison is a Plantronics set that I used at work for several years. There IS no comparison really! I guess that for the price, you can't expect too much, so I gave this 2 stars for that reason alone. Everyone that I talk to says that my voice is reasonably clear and I can hear pretty well in the speaker of the set. All the same, I think that next time I will just go back to Plantronics."
4,Good reception,"Im happy with this product and it fits my needs well. I have good reception through it, and I guess that's all I can ask for. I'd buy again."
4,so far so good,I ordered this item and received it within a few days. Since I just opened it today I am only giving it 4 stars because I am not exactly sure about the longevity of the product.I have a panasonic phone and this headset I can hear the people on the other end clear and they can hear me clear. There was a couple minutes where I was getting some crackling noise but I was moving around a lot and I am not sure if it wasn't just my phone line. The band that goes over my head is secure (I have a plantronics one and the band is so large it is always falling off if I bend over or shake my head) I can bend over and even shake my head without it flying off my head.
2,One after another dissapointment,"Ordered a 3.5mm male connect received a 2, had to run around to get a adaptor for $5 more. Then the mouth piece failed. Totally useless for what I wanted.Up side my kid uses it with his X Box."
5,"Headset, excellent!","I have tendonitis in my wrists. I can now talk on my cell phone again! I just wish it had a volume control to I could turn the volume higher when I'm in noisy places, but that happens so seldom. I'm buying 3 more, one for my car, a back up, and one for a freind. You can't beat the price!"
2,Didn't fit me,"Perhaps it is just my head, but this did not fit me well and I stopped using it immediately."
2,Disappointed...not for a computer,"I bought this to use for my computer because I need my hands free, and I don't want my neighbors to hear my conversations. The 2.5mm jack which I didn't even know there was a size difference in headphone jacks nowadays, is too small. I can't say how the quality is because I never got to use it. This is supposed to go into a cordless phone I guess...but I typed in headsets for computers...not sure why I got this in my search results...but you know this doesn't even fit my cell phone if I wanted to use it with that!! So I'm a bit irritated by that too. I have to hassle sending it back and waiting another 3 weeks to get a headset now."
1,Ignorance??,"Shame on me? I didn't read carefully, I guess? This product requires that you are physically attatched - a very short tether - to the base unit.Don't plan on wandering!!"
1,Cannot rate because it is not compatible with phones.,"This product was pictured with the Panasonic cordless Digital phone system which I purchased at the same time, but this headset cannot be plugged into the phone. It does not fit.I am returning it."
2,Wrong size of plugin,Ordered this for use with a PC but the plugin was wrong (meant for a standard phone jack).
5,"A mandatory, ancillary purchase to go with my AT&T DTECT four handset phone system","We recently bought theAT&T; SL82418 Four Handset Answering System. While we're very pleased with that purchase, it does have one annoying design quirk: the redial button is in a touchy position - try to tuck the phone in the crook of your shoulder and you're almost guaranteed to interrupt your current call. So, if you're an IT guy like me, be prepared to type with one hand. For that reason, a hands-free headset is a mandatory, ancillary purchase for the AT&T; DTECT phone system.The Amazon buying engine recommends buying this Panasonic KX-RCA60 Hands-Free Headset along with the AT&T; Four Handset product. Don't be concerned about cross-vendor usage: this no-frills unit works straight out of the box. I'm sitting here on a conference call while typing this review. Problem solved!"
4,No mute,"This headset has been a wonderful addition to my home office. My only desire would be for it to have a mute switch.Update: 3/2011- I still use my headset and it is still going strong. I like that the mic is adjustable so that I can move it closer if needed. I Also like that I can switch ears with it by simply rotating the mic. I have a Motorolla Blue Tooth that I use on occasion and also a Plantronics that I use, but I keep coming back to this one for the comfort ~ or maybe just a change of pace!"
5,"Nice Headset, but...","Summary: Excellent headset for the money. But, I have had a couple with wires failing over 3 to 9 months of daily use at work. This headset is equal to Plantronics M201C. Switching the mike amp on with the 201c does increase volume a little, but isn't as clear. The Panasonic TCA80 (foldable) does not sound a good on the other end, not as crisp, but it is still acceptable.Side note: With three bluetooth headsets, of varying reported quality, I realized that you just don't get the same quality that hard wired ones give you. Primarily, the difference is in how good you sound on the other end."
4,"Great headset, no problems",Have no problems with this headset. Received it a couple of weeks ago and I can hear clearly and can also be heard clearly. Feels more comfortable on my head than my previous model.
5,Just a Basic Headset,I really like this headset. It is simple basic and has good sound and volume. I like that there is no volume control or other useless bells and whistles.
3,Might be a great product...,...but I wouldn't know for sure. The Panasonic phone I ordered with the headset doesn't provide a jack for a headset.
1,Not worth the effort,"Works great! Easy to store, takes abuse, like the bendable mike and the way the headset fits on my head and doesn't mess up my hair."
1,dam good headset,I called long distance for a test and the headset had clarity both outgoing and incoming
4,Perfect for casual use.,Exactly what I was looking for. It works with my cordless and my cell phone.
1,do not buy,"item does not work. much better to buy from a local store - only a few more $$. At least there is some immediate recourse for a shoddy product. Junk like this discourages internet purchases. Specifically, headset was carefully plugged in and was immediately noisy - howling and squealing feedback. Impossible to use."
3,Third set,I usethis daily on my home corless phone. it is clear to listen too and othyer poeple you talk to say it is very clear. The only reason for the # stars and not more is all 3 sets the wire in the cable has broken. It takes about 6 mohts to a years to do. If you ever flex the cable much or put and stress on it it will statr having staic on the call. I know there not expensive but i am old school and expect quality form Panasonic.
3,Hands free,"Panasonic KX-TCA60 Hands-Free Headset with Comfort Fit Headband. Head set is okay, but needs a volume adjustment knob. You have to really listen carefully with this head set because it is very low. Mic works fine and can be heard clearly."
4,Great value for the money - something under $10 that works!,"I've owned this headset for the better part of a year. I can break anything. I work from home when not traveling and am constantly on the phone. I've owned $300 cordless/wireless headsets and expensive wired headsets. This one has outlasted them all. And it's 9 bucks. Seriously? Yes. Ok, it is not fancy, doesn't have a ton of features but it gives me what I want: comfortable, easy-to-hear, hands-free telephone conversations at an extremely attractive price. I'm eyeing a couple more for other phones around my place as well as to have a backup just in case some day I do my usual and somehow break it.Very well done."
1,headset,"audio level very low and distored, I tried to use it with my i-phone. I was very disapointed with it"
3,Good value for the price,"This headset works alright for the most part, except that I constantly have to adjust the mic to ensure that I'm heard by the other party. The mic has to be right next to my mouth for my voice to be audible. I like it for the price and the fact that this will work with both my old Panasonic cordless phones as well as the newer ones on the market."
3,Good audio input/output. Poor construction.,"Simple review: you get what you pay for. The audio quality of the microphone and the earpiece were very good to excellent. However, since the whole thing is made out of plastic, its durability is not the best. It's obviously not meant for heavy daily use. If you use if for several hours a day, putting it on and removing it several times a day, expect it to break in a few months. Ours lasted about 8 months before the headstrap adjuster cracked apart."
4,Great headset!,"I have looked at a lot of headsets and most are not adequate. I use the phone a lot in my line of work and was looking for something that was comfortable to wear and that would have good sound quality, both on the receiver and on the other end. Because of the great price point I bought two, and I am not regretting it at all.Pros:- Good fit, still feels comfortable even after a while- great sound quality, both headphone and mic.- Loud, which is a good thing. With this headset I have to turn down the volume on my phone most of the time, leaving me some room to play with. Other headsets I always maxed out.- Solid quality- Incredibly priced, you don't always have to buy the most expensive to get good quality!Cons:None really...Some remarks:- Although the headset is a good fit, it might feel tight after a while, something I am used to now, but could get uncomfortable if you have to wear it all day.- The headset is pretty bulky, but that comes with the quality as well. headset feels solid."
1,Not good for a telecommuter,"I agree the boom is longer, which can be an advantage. However, as a telecommuter who multitasks like crazy while on conference calls, this headset won't work. There are no controls on it for volume, or to mute. Panasonic makes a better product, with these controls, as well as a noise cancelling microphone: PAN-KXTCA92. I am sending back the 3 of these I ordered, for the other model. More $$, but you get what you pay for."
4,A very good Panasonic Headset,"I got this headset for my Panasonic cordless phones. The mic boom is longer than it is on many other headsets - an advantage. Earphone volume is no problem, and voice quality (what I hear on my end) is actually better than it is through the phone. Comfort is, to me, not great. However, I always modify headphones to reduce pressure and increase padding, as I am very particular about head and ear comfort. In this case, I found the rubber pad on the far end of the headband to be hard; I added a soft pad, and now have acceptable comfort. Anyway, this is a high-quality headset, one I recommend."
2,Good sound but breaks easily,"This headset sounds good but breaks very easily. Some other Panasonic models share this ""feature"". Mine worked well for a couple of weeks and then the mic went out (I can hear people b ut they can't hear me). Other people have explained that if you rotate the microphone it puts stress on the wires inside and can cause them to break. Four stars for sound quality, one star for durability.Bottom line -- it sounds good for the money but don't swivel the mic!"
5,Very nice; works with my wire and wireless phone,"Works well with both my Panasonic wireless and with my AT&T; desk phone. Easy to use, good quality, everything I'd like and very inexpensive. Highly recommended.You can't beat the ""value for dollar"""
4,"A good product, especially for the price",I bought 3 of these headsets. Two friends and I use them to talk to each other while we walk on our treadmills each night. These work great to help us keep our exercise going during the winter months.A very good product. The price makes it even better.
4,Good Headsets,Good headsets overall. Only complaint is that the connection wire from the headset to the phone causes static in the headset when touched or moved while headset is in use.
3,I have not used it as much as I thought I would.,"This device works well with my cordless phones but since there is a good speaker on the phones, I have not used the headset as much as I thought I would. It is not very easy to carry around. I had actually planned to use it when I am at my desk and working on the computer while I'm talking. I don't like to use the speaker phone all the time when I am sitting there. However, the base unit that is on my desk does not have a hookup for the headset! I may keep it in the car to use with my cell phone while driving."
4,Great Phone Headphones,"They work great. Feel good on my head. And I have not heard anyone on the other line complain. Basically, they do the job. And the price was hard to beat."
1,"didn't work, poor quality",sorry to say this headset did NOT work for us. Constant Static and reception cut in and out when the cord moved (which of course the cord moves constantly when you're wearing the headset). Had to return it the same day.
3,Get what you pay for,"I have owned several of these headsets. For the most part they have worked well for about a year until the thin plastic where the headband adjusts breaks. The last time one broke, I ordered a new one and then figured out that a paperclip and some duct tape made it workable.. 5 months later the wire stated to go bad from my dropping the phone with the headset attached many times, which created static on the line. I began to use the new one; it lasted less than 1 week before the microphone almost completely ceased working. It was too late to return it, but for $9 what can one expect?"
3,does the job,they do there job but not very comfy there is no adjustment for how tight they wrap around your head and it makes them hurt after a while but what i do is just put a small headphone cushion on the other side and its fine and for the price u cant beat it just want a metal band around ur head to adjust the thightness
5,Buy this!,"I purchased 4 of the Panasonic KX-TCA60 Hands-Free Headsets With Comfort Fit Headband...two for myself and two for my mother. The price was low so I figured if the quality wasn't good ""I got what I paid for"". Well, I would have bought 8 headsets, or more, to pass on to friends and family if I had known I would be so pleased with my purchase! You can't beat the quality you get at this price!"
5,Works great.,"Fits nicely on head. Sometimes it's too loud, even when I turn my phone volume all the way down (could be a phone issue tho)."
5,If you have a Panasonic phone this is the headset to have!,I bought the Panasonic KX-TCA60 to replace the same model that I had used for 8 years. The Panasonic plug is slightly different from the normal headset. If you have a Panasonic phone this is the headset to have.
4,Comfortable fit and clear sound,Seems to be a good quality product. This headset exceeded my expectations. Thanks to others who recommended it. It isn't flimsy and has good volume.
2,"Durability and short warranty, not such a great combo",The sound quality was fine while the unit worked. But as stated in other reviews after the short 90 day warranty period the microphone on my unit failed. What good is good sound quality if you can't use the product for it's intended purpose - listening AND talking? I would not purchase this product again.
2,Great -until it stopped working!,"I loved this headset, it was so easy to use, and had great sound quality. Having my hands free allowed me to get things done around the house while chatting on the phone and then one day the microphone stopped working. I heard, ""What?? I can't hear you!"" They heard nothing. I have had this headset for 2 months and it is still under warranty, so I will call the 800-number and see what can be done."
2,Headset is disappointing.,Sound volume on headset receiver is marginal. Microphone is apparently mediocre according to feedback from persons on other end. This instrument is not satisfactory for my purposes.
3,Good one,Not so excellent and not so bad.Just does justice to its price.Good One.The micro phone should have been better.Go for it..u wont be disappointed.
4,Great sound,"No, it's not one of those tiny, little in-the-ear headsets and you do look like Julie, the Time-Life operator from the old commercials. But the sound is great - both incoming and outgoing. It stays put once you have it on. I recommend it."
3,It worked nicely for a while....but then the cord shorted out.,"This worked nicely for a while...but then the cord shorted out. It is a very comfortable headset, the sound quality was great until it started to crackle with a short in the cord. I used it almost daily....I probably just needed a more commercial quality for my use. I probably got my money's worth out of it."
4,Great Preforming Headset,"I work from home and bought this headset to allow me to talk on the phone while working on the computer. This headset has the advantage of no extra (like volume controls , ...) features it is just a plane headset. I have been using it for a while and it works flawlessly.It takes abuse well it is constantly being knocked on the floor and the wires are run over by my chair and it still keeps working."
4,Panasonic Hands Free headset,The cord length and clip are perfect. The Headset fits perfectly and is easy to put on. The sponge for the ear piece is a bit large and rough. The volume is fine and the sound is crystal clear.
3,"Slightly uncomfortable, but works well.","The headset works like it's supposed to. It's not the most comfortable thing in the world, but it's not that bad."
1,Cheap Junk,I have had this item a little over 90 days and the microphone has stopped working. I have not abused it. Will contact manufacturer regarding replacement.
2,Worked great until it died,"I only had mine for about four months before it stopped working all of a sudden. Even tried switching phones to no avail. Before that it worked very well. I had picked it up to use at my office because so many people say that it works well with Panasonic phones (I've got a 5.8ghz cordless - the Panasonic KX-TG5050W).Pros: people said that they could hear me clearly, and it did a good job of blocking out background noise. Great value for the price.Cons: I really expected it to last more than 4 months! It would also be nice if it had a mute button."
1,"Static, and cuts out!","I bought this because the Panasonic phone I have is so uncomfortable to hold, it causes muscle spasms in my hand after a few minutes. This headset has lots of static, and also cuts out every few seconds, making conversation all but impossible. It would only be throwing away good money after bad, to pay to return it, so instead I warn others not to waste their money on this item."
1,Misinformation from Amazon,"Be aware that this handset is for a *cordless* phone only... even though it was suggested as the perfect companion -- by amazon -- for the *corded* office phone I bought at the same time. And when you search for a headset for a corded phone, it shows up in the top results. Incredibly annoying. ""Cordless"" isn't mentioned in the bullet points for the product, either. This is more annoyance at Amazon's recommendation than at the product. The reco gets 0 stars."
1,READ THIS BEFORE BUYING - does not work w/ iphone or mac,Do not buy this if you are planning on using it w/ iphone or you computer - or anything that has an 1/8 jack. It will not work..
3,Worked fine until 7 months later...,"As a office manager, I am responsible for answering and routing calls as necessary. I purchased two of these handsets March 2, 2012 and now that we are in late December 2012, these handsets interrupts random phone called due to the high level of static that comes through them. At first we were willing to deal with it however our customers have even commented on the level of static.My advice is to go with another brand if you are looking for a long-lasting product. Unfortunately I do not know of any to handsets or brands to recommend, however if you know of any, please comment below!"
5,Enjoyable reading about a horrible event,"I thoroughly enjoyed Personal Justice. From the moment I started reading the book, I found I wanted to keep reading the book. I didn't know what to expect when I first began to read the book, but I was pleasantly surprised. I usually don't read books about terrorism or war, but the book held my interest from start to finish. It was easy to read and well written. The characters were well defined and I felt as if I knew them personally."
5,It works,"It's works. The only dislike I have is it can only export the disk using Windows or Apple shares, so if you are using Linux you'll have to use smbfs to connect."
2,Introduces network instability on Belkin pre-N router,"Even after I force it to a static IP address, this system produces instability on my Belkin pre-N router network. However, I turn it on for 5 min per week to back everything up using Retrospect and things do work. This is not as easy as it should be..."
4,Linkstation 250GB review,"I purchased the first generation Linkstation 250GB a couple of years ago and have been happy with it. Only problem I have had is that the fan started making strange noises (bearings failed) so I got a new replacement fan for $25. Given my overall good experiences, I decided to purchase a new Linkstation Pro 250GB recently to add to my server farm. Highly recommend the Buffalo."
4,Fun in a Small Package!,"""And now it's time for a little trombone!"" That's what I say before pulling this little guy out...it always gets a laugh but the tone quality that eminates from this Jupiter, is no laughing matter! This horn has the tember, or tone quality, somewhere between a good B-flat trumpet and a Flugel Horn. It can be sharp or mellow. These instruments are usually tone-flat, or are very difficult to get the sound you want, but this time Jupiter has got it right. The instrument is one octave above the more common tenor trombone, complete with the seven slide-positions a tenor player would expect but much shorter. If you are a trombone player and are woried about the trumpet mouthpiece, used on this instrument, ruining your emboucher, don't wory...I have experienced that it reinforces your tenor playing abilities...I have had no negative effects (just dont blow your lip out). Not a bad price either! Have Fun!"
2,Get the OTA pitch the rest,"Hearing so much about refractors, and this scope in particular I bought one. I was disappointed in almost all respects. The scope gave nice views, but was not functional otherwise. The tripod is too small. The one I received was scraped, and rusty. The focuser required two hands to move smoothly. The mount was wobbly. Don't believe you can take photos with this assembly. Glad this was not my first scope, or I'd be keeping fish instead. The mount and tripod certainly didn't help my opinion of Chinese imports."
3,OUI... INTERESSANT....,"Les Variations Goldberg se prtent volontiers à leur adaptation pour un trio à cordes.L'idée ne choque pas en soi, mme si les puristes rechignent à de tels arrangements.Bach lui-mme adorait arranger les oeuvres de ses contemporains, en y apportant souvent un éclairage nouveau et son génie recréatif.L'arrangement de Dmitri Sitkovetsky pour trio à cordes apporte une grande variété tonale et une expressivité de l'aeuvre supérieure à la seule exécutiion au clavecin ou mme au piano.C'est bien fait, mais la lecture n'est pas simple et l'audition parfois un peu déconcertante.Mme si l'on connat bien les V.G., il faut bien s'accrocher.Interpétation de tès haut niveau, mais on n'en exige pas moins pour ce type d'oeuvre."
3,Too much oil,"I ordered this for checking the relief on my guitars as well. When I received it, I noticed that there was a lot of oil on it. I tried to wash it off with detergents, but it was still there. I do not want to get any extra oil on my guitars, so I went with a smaller model that did not have any lubricant. I imagine it would be fine for automotive, but do not get this stuff on your fretboard!Be warned, there is a lot of lubricant and it does not come off easily."
5,AMAZING TOOL FOR GUITAR PLAYERS!!,You just don't need to spend $25 or more for a thing like this to setup your guitars. Grizzly Feeler Gauge cost me a few buks and I couldn't be more satisfied!! Buy it!!
2,What Happens?,"My review is more of a question. Mr.Polansky goes into details about most things people want to know, but he never informs the reader what happens on November 24th 2006. What ever it is it affects everyone. I wished he would of informed the reader."
3,Cheap but gets the job done (would not use for finish carpentry though),"Needed a big forstner bit for a deck I was rebuilding to recess the bolts attaching the railings.I did NOT want to spend a lot of $$$ since this was going to be a throwaway due to using it on PT wood.This handled the 35-40 recesses I needed to put in place even after hitting a couple of nails in the framing.It ended up in the recycle after I was done as it wasn't worth the cost of getting it sharpened after the abuse I put it through.The edges of the holes were not as crisp (even straight out of the package) as some of my better bits create, but if you need a large size bit this will do the trick.The bottom of the holes was pretty flat and all in all I am very happy with the bit."
1,Never received our CD and never heard back from Gary's Books,"We paid Amazon for this CD and of course the money went to Gary's Books but we have not received our CD yet. 3 e=mails to Gary's books have never been answered or explained. The same to Amazon. So we will never feel confident about ordering anything again from Amazon. Therefore, we will never order thru Amazon again.Wish it could have been different.Joy Bell"
3,Got What I Paid For.....,"I've had this vacuum for 2 weeks now, and I have to say, it does suck up the hair. I have a St. Bernard dog and 2 cats so needless to say, I have alot of hair. The only negative thing I can say about the vacuum is that when vacuuming off the furniture, it has a tendency to tip over on top of me because the hose is so short. But for the price, it does alot better cleaning than my Phantom ever did."
5,"Jimmy Smith ""Rockin The Boat""","This CD is one of my sister's favorites and it brings back many fond memories, and the good times we had. It is one of the jazz collector's favorites and they share many stories about the good ole days."
5,Reading the 4 gospels together like a novel !,What a great way to get the uniqueness of all 4 of the writers' perspectives into an easy-to-read flow. It also includes plenty of explanatory notes about the culture and politcal environment that Western readers may not know.
3,Concise but not in-depth,"This book is a great way to read the gospels! I would recommend it to anyone wanting to read Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John in chronological order and in parallel. However, I'm a bit disappointed because there isn't much in the way of commentary. Another resource on hand would be a wise decision if wanting to dive into the gospels in-depth."
2,Please LOOK INSIDE!,"I wished I would have looked more closely inside (see pages 5-6), as another reviewer had wished for more ""commentary"" and another warned it was ""just"" a harmony of the gospels, ""that's it"". On the contrary, nearly half of every page on average (which pages 5-6 exemplify) is occupied by the author's own notes and commentary, which I found rarely contributed much. This book could have been half the size or length had it just been the gospel texts themselves. All the emboldened words and phrases have just been distracting for me."
2,I hope the 3rd time is the charm,"I have to RMA two of these kits already.The first pair (double-row of LEDs) would get too hot after an hour of use. I googled and found out they had a new revision that only had chips and LEDs on one side... suppose to be cooler.Returned the first pair and got the new rev of the stick in return.The 2nd pair worked well for a week or two, but then I noticed strange behavior on my PC. I thought it was a game I installed, but after uninstalling, I started seeing BSOD a day or two later. I ran memtest86 and saw errors on one of the sitcks. Re-tested them individually and one of the sticks had lots of errors. ARRGH!I'm sending this one back too, but I'm rather upset.If I could just get a refund or a different non-tracer type at this point, I would.... but Crucial will only replace like for like.buyer beware"
1,Great if it was more reliable,"I'm a computer programmer and buy a lot of computer hardware. I've probably RMA'd more than 12 sticks of Crucial Ballistix memory (both Tracer and non-Tracer) in the past 2 years. They all seem to eventually fail. They might work well for awhile and last a few months, but eventually they seem to fail and need to be RMA'd. I don't overclock the memory and other brands of RAM don't have this problem. Too bad because the LEDs are nice. I recommend another brand like OCZ, G.SKILL, or Corsair."
3,Typical Russ Ballard,"Into The Fire is typical Russ Ballard - half an album of great stuff, and half an album of mediocrity. Don't get me wrong, I am a long time Russ Ballard fan, and he is the most unheralded songwriter of the Rock Era. I mean, this is the guy who penned ""God Gave Rock 'n' Roll to You"" My problem is that for every two albums, you get one album's worth of great songs - but at his best he is so good that I would buy his albums for just one song."
4,an intimate glimpse of the 20th century,"I bought this book for my mom, and then had to have a copy for myself. This contains thousands of postcard images, as well as the messages. The images include famous architecture and people, comics and pop culture of a hundred years, and the messages give us a glimpse of everyday life throughout the last century. Hours and hours of browsing enjoyment, especially for postcard collectors!"
3,The Postcard Century,"This provides good reading for both the postcard collector and the ""history buff"". I WAS a bit disappointed that about 85% of the cards are from the UK, but hey, so is the writer. It's just that I find the ""Brits"" a bit reserved in their letter-writing (the written message on the cards is presented). It's a great book for a long winter's read (I'm only up to 1938)."
2,Postcard pictures,I was disapointed in this book because I was looking for one that included more detailed information about postcards. The problem of buying online I guess.
3,A Broadway Fan and A Figures Skating Fan's Idea of the Longe,"When I saw Brian Boitano's Skating Spectacular, Franc who seems to be a friend of Brian's Sang while Brian skated. They said that he had played The Phantom longer than anyone else.Therefore, I bought this CD. When I started listening to the first songs, I could not believe that Franc had played the Phantom. His voice sounded too young. His version of the song from PIPPIN did not sound as good to me as an American Idol Contestant's had. I thought he might be satirizing Broadway.When I came to song Number 11, my opinion changed. His songs from then on, were great. I have listened to the HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA hundreds of times. I don't think I could tell his MUSIC OF THE NIGHT from Michael Crawford's.If you would enjoy a quirky version of Broadway songs mixed with really good ones, get this CD. If you want straight Broadway, try Ron Raines."
1,Wrong author listed,"Although the page lists Rosemary Sutcliff as the author, this book is actually a different book with the same title by William Mayne. I was looking forward to reading another of Rosemary Sutcliff's books, but this book was rather dull."
5,He's Great!,"I love Del Reeves. I know him personaly, my father and Del served in the Air Force together. I really like his music,He sings as down to earth as he really is, So keep up the good work. Clea's Daughter Donna"
4,Original MONO Versions,"Sound quality is equal to that of the Rhino collection and almost the same song listing. No Notes, no chart info as the Rhino, but if you just want the music, buy it. The Stereo versions are on the Collectables C.D and sound very different from the mono"
5,Works for me.,"I have one of these enclosures with a 100GB Hitachi drive. It sits on top of my Mac Mini (OSX 10.4.9). It comes on when I power up the Mini in the morning, then goes off after a few minutes. At 5:01pm SuperDuper! fires up, the drive comes on, and SuperDuper! backs up my internal drive to the Hitachi. After a while the external drive goes off again. I use the provided USB cable which also supplies the power for the drive. The enclosure I have has the Prolific USB chipset, which at one time was not recommended by the SuperDuper! folks, but it seems to be fine (maybe there was a problem at some time in the past, but it seems fixed now)."
3,The Town,"I saw the movie first and I would have to say that I liked the movie more than the book. Don't get me wrong this was a good book, but I just thought the movie was better."
5,Excellent!,"I cannot say enough about this book...and the author, Chuck Hogan. The book grabs your attention from the very beginning and brings you in. Very well written. This is a book that will stay with you for a very long time, feeling like you have lost some friends when you are done.I am glad to see he has finally come out with some more books! If you are even thinking about getting this book- grab it with both hands!"
5,Worth the Money,"I bought the audio version on i tunes for 13.00. It was worth the money. Chuck Hogan is an awesome writer. His choice of descriptive words are perfect. His cleverness makes the reader want more. He writes just enough to keep the reader interested. This book is not overly done. You will not get board. Donnie's delivery is on queue. He speaks with passion, almost as if he is really there, in the story. It is a thief story and a love story. After finishing the audio, I do not know who I love more. I love Chucks writing style, Donnies voice, and Dougs devotion (one of the characters in the book)."
3,Slow start,"Slow to get started, but seriously picks up towards the middle. Interesting insight on Boston bank robbers, better read than the movie."
2,Eh.,Dennis Lehane lite. I never really felt that involved with the story or the characters. It was flat and anticlimactic.
2,F-bombed,"I decided this book wasn't worth my time early on. The author drops so many f-bombs in the first 10 pages it was like reading a bathroom wall, if I wanted to waste my time doing that I would. By the end of that I was so apathetic to the main characters I was hoping for the cops to come and mow them down!"
4,"Fast-paced, compelling story","I couldn't put this book down. I can hardly wait for the movie version. The author has a gifted way with words. His characters are believeable, as is the dialog. Young actors will be clamoring to play the tough Boston criminals, who think they can realize their dreams if they can steal enough cash to buy their way out.The love story is a bit weak, but not completely out-of-step with the ideal of Catholic youth. Claire Keesey is the good girl from the good family, the kind of girl a straight guy would want to marry. Recovering alcoholic, Doug MacRay, wants to lead a clean and sober life, put his criminal nature to rest, and leave Charlestown with Claire; after one last big job."
4,A Fantastic Heist Novel,"I was drawn to this novel when I read all of the great reviews for the film that it inspired. I'm the kind of person who likes to read the book before the movie. I was struck by the grit that Hogan portrays when describing this section of Boston. While comparisons can be made to Dennis Lehane, I think Hogan brings a unique view to this story. On the surface, it appears to be a run of the mill action/heist story, but at its core, this novel is a riveting tale of forbidden love and the struggle to overcome the limitations of class and family."
4,His best,"Have read all his novels.This is his best though Standoff comes in close second.Similar feel ala Lehane's novels with Kenzie and Gennaro.Good action, good plot, fast read. Good vacation or beach read.The Town is coming out in the fall, movie based on this novel. Looks to be a entertaining adaptation."
5,Buy Amazon not www.TylerTool.com,"Great router kit. I first ordered from TylerTool.com only to wait and wait for nothing because they said it was in stock when you order, then they fail to let you know that they don't even have it in stock. I'm finding out that there is more and more online tool business like Tyler Tools that are doing this type of deceptive selling with attractive low price listings stealing time and money from buyers and legitimate sellers like Amazon. Anyway, Amazon had it in stock and I'm not disappointed."
1,Verrrry poor quality in electronics!,"I have one of the DW621 routers and when it did work it was very handy to use but with less than 20 hours of use and the electronic module has gone bad and to git it to work I have to heat the module with a heat gun if I do want to use it and when I tried to purchase a new module they are out of stock and been like that for several months and no one can say when they might come in so all I can tell you is ""DON'T GET THIS P.O.S. UNLESS YOU JUST WANT TROUBLE"" Oh I gave it one star only because that is as low as they go."
1,This might be intertaining for a total neanderthal...,What A lame movie! The antics in this...movie dont even qualify for a low budget B rated movie! Don't waste your time unless you want to give your money away. It was so unthrilling even my burping was foul when i got a taste for this totally unremarkable piece of trash!
2,2 STARS,"Beautiful creatures that are beckoned by human sorrow, desires, and longing. They grant any wish of your heart's desire, but you must be ready to pay them back! All they ask for is to be compensated with the same 'weighted' price as the wish itself.To many manga enthusiast, it will be apparent from the start that the art work is amazing. But as a forewarn, this manga is cut short. There are only 3 Volumes to the series, and Volume 4 is on hiatus. I only 'wish' it could continue =)Alichino is about a young man who has the ability to attract Alichino since birth, but he never knew why. With this mysterious connection he has with these creatures all those around him end up hurt, killed, or dying. What is enticing these beautiful beings? Only one way to find out."
1,Alichino manga review,"I saw an ad for this manga in my GL magazine, and it looked pretty interesting to me. I didn't even get to the next chapter of the book when I bought it. I thought that the art work was horrible and the story line was awful! I thought that this would be a good story because the author is very famous for his stories and his art work and he has won very many awards. I don't think you would want to waste your time reading this book.-Chibi"
1,i've been ripped off,"I got this as a Christmas gift in 2005, so it is out of warranty. It had been used less than 100 hrs. when the CD player stopped working, leaving my CDs stuck inside. When I called the number for authorized repairs, I got a recording telling me it was too cheap to repair. I then emailed, asking for a repair service; never got a reply. I took it to a local shop, and was told the whole CD system was broken, and the part would cost him 180.00, without labor. This unit cost my daughter 170.00, which is no small amount of money."
2,"Romance, not science fiction","If a way I should be happy I bought this book, because it gives me hope that, bad a writer as I am, I could one day publish a book. Two specifics:1. This is a romance novel, not a science fiction novel. If you want to read a science fiction novel like I did, don't buy this.2. The writing style belabored. An example appears early in the book when the same event is presented from two different character's perspectives. This is done very clunkily (is that a word?), as if the author is unable to 'get inside the skin' of the characters. Unfortunately, this inability to present three dimensional characters continues. It reads like a longer version of a high school essay."
3,Is this MilSIFI or a Romence Novel in wolf skin,"Last reviewer got it right, so many plot lines and after reading it still not sure what I just read.Loved the focus on the supply chain folks and lower decks a great move but I image it is hard to keep a plot line moving from that POY, which is why we see so little of it.My call is read this book and see if she can improve in the next one on the back story and give us more on the world she wants to tells us about.Maybe she can tell us what the heck a tower, the rocks and the flats are I could not picture this ship in my mind. Loved the DNGO so lets support her efforts here. Less romance more on the world the story is set in, imho."
4,better than i thought,"When I read the first few pages of this book, I was not impressed. It seemed hard to understand and used a background that was strange. The next day, i picked it up again and before I quit, I had read it from cover to cover, twice. It could use more explanation as to the background universe but the main beauty is the developement of the characters. They were well written, believable, and likeable. The author, having served as a U.S. Naval officer, has the military down pat. Don't give up after the first few pages, keep reading, it's worth it.I hope this is just the first in a long series."
2,Troublesome Creek,"This is the story of a sixteen year old girl, Cooper, living in a small village in Kentuky in the 1800s. Her stepmother wants her to become a lady and wishes to send her away in boarding school. Cooper wants to stay home.I had a hard time getting throught the first half of the book. The plot moves back and forth in time, the author concentrating first on Cooper, then her father, then her step-mother, back on Cooper, her childhood friend etc. All of this felt confusing and kept me from being interested in Cooper's story. It didn't help that all the characters act like if they're angels. No one makes mistakes, gets angry, drunk, uncharitable or even says anything stupid. They did not feel real to me. People are not perfect. Only God is.Respectfully, I found that the christian content overwhelmed the plot. I especially didn't care for (what felt like) pages after pages of sermon. This may be a big turn-off for some readers."
3,"Great writing, but not enough tension","For a first novel, the writing in this book deserves five stars. The author does not write as a novice. However most of the book is written about catching chickens, washing clothes, cooking food, running around barefoot and a young girl's worry about whether or not her step-mother is going to send her off to school. It is a beautifully described tale that became SO boring to me because of the lack of tension, that I skipped over alot of really GOOD writing. Probably too much back story. The love story combined with the father's declining health happened MUCH too late in the novel. Making it difficult for me to even connect with the main character and her suitor whom I liked alot. I just wished he would have been written in sooner. However, if tension is not your thing, I highly recommend this book. It's a cross over between ""Little House on the Prairie"" and ""Christie,"" (without tension)."
1,Good grief!,"This book left me shaking my head and wondering why I was still reading it. I made it only through the first 1/4 then deleted it from my Kindle. The romance was ridiculous. I think the writer had some good ideas but could use some help with dialogue. The cheese factor was a little too high for my liking.I do, however, highly recommend Fireflies in December by Jennifer Erin Valent...also a Kindle freebie and written well! A real page turner."
2,Disjointed,"Liked the characters quite a bit. But the story was too disjointed. Clearly, the author has a gift for creating a character(Copper), and that gift kept me reading. The story line, meh. I felt disappointed by ending, and there were places where the writing wasn't clear and precise. I found myself having to back-track to follow the story."
2,Uhhhhhh....not what I expected,"Other than the ""Please Come Home for Christmas"" song, I wasn't so impressed. I didn't know one other song on the album and I really didn't even like them. After the ""Please Come Home for Christmas song played, I found myself removing the CD and putting in another. Nahhhhh....not too impressed. Buy the ""Please Come Home for Christmas"" song on a single and save yourself some money."
3,Warning,"Ever thought of 'thinking outside of the box' and learning something that might enlighten your views of life here on earth as you know it? This book might be a great place to start. After having read the book, I contacted the author and have learned of his dedication to many abductees he works with on a regular basis!"
3,"Low Odds, However, if he's right...","Richard Posner once wrote a book explaining that we tend to overlook low probability events with extreme consequences, like earth being hit by a large asteroid.I would regard this book as in that light. The odds that Mr Greenfield is right -- that a race of reptile aliens have been regularly harvesting and eating the human race strikes me as low. However, if Mr. Greenfield's ""Warning"" is correct, it is important to take precautions.Therefore, I agree that perhaps it would be wise to, as he suggests, to ""negotiate a mutually beneficial trade agreement with the Reptoids. We will trade meat and other products for trade goods, advanced technology and knowledge, used star ships, etc.""He also recommends further development of our laser weapons, which, as Star Wars fan, I think is a good idea."
1,what a crackpot!,"This book is written by a crackpot. What else do I need to say? Aliens are going to eat us? Oh NO! Did I just start a world-wide panic! This information needs to be presented to us in such a way that we can handle it mentally and emotionally.I have an open mind about aliens and whatnot, but this is ridiculous! There is ""countless evidence"" about this going on? I find that VERY difficult to swallow! Aliens have been in contact with us for thousands of years, and many different species of aliens, and the presidents and the government are covering it up? Can we say paranoid and delusional?GIVE ME A BREAK! Money from this book is going towards building weapons against aliens. I recommend that NO ONE buys this book. Unless you're high and believe in all this crap (and believe me, it is COMPLETE CRAP!)"
1,Get a life!!,I cannot believe that this guy actually believes that aliens are gonna come n eat us!! I bet he's some freak that stays in his house online all day looking at pictures of supposed aliens. He probably sits there like a hermit. You all know the type I'm talking about. The kind that's so obsessed and paranoid they either rarely or never associate with others. I bet he thinks that the government is following him too. Haha!
2,Tore up!,They seemed to tear up throughout my sanding... I would go through a belt per board... It was a real pain!I eventually gave up because it eat through all the remaining belts. Overall before they tore up... they did a good job.
2,Abba karaoke,"Considering all the Abba karaoke cd's I have now, this is my least favorite. I'm happy it had 3 I couldn't find anywhere else (That's Me, When I Kissed The Teacher, & Dum Dum Diddle), but was not that impressed. Has no vocal backgrounds at all and the acoustic parts are on keyboard."
2,A BASIC overview but it's weak in several places.,"Finally there is a book on RoboHelp, but it just doesn't deliver. Watch out if you use NT, the graphic folder locations are absolute rather than relative references, so you get errors on every project. I didn't think that creating images in Paintbrush had anything to do with RoboHelp, but you spent several pages to it. The cover of the book is very flimsy."
1,Not for experienced users...,"it was too basic. You could have installed RoboHelp and reviewed the online tutorial and gained just as much (if not more) experience. I was very disappointed in the material presented. If you are an experienced (or current) RoboHelp user, you will not gain anything from this material."
1,Poorly written and far too basic,The lessons are very poorly planned and presented. The amount of information you actually gain is so rudimentary that it's really not worth the time and effort.
5,Help for pig skin mexican chairs,"I have had my pig skin equipale chairs for a few years and they are outside on my patio. I needed help restoring the leather and keeping it moist from the sun exposure and temperatures in the summer. This product did the trick, I love it and would recommend it to others. But I had to buy double what I thought in the beginning because the skin was so dried out...it is worth every penny. Paia"
5,great oil,"I soaked some old reins in a bowl of oil overnight, it worked amazingly!! I used a couple layers of it on some old boots and it bought them back to life! LOVE this stuff!"
1,Nancy Drew in Outer Space -- Skip It,"A longtime Sci-Fi fan, I'm always on the lookout for new authors to add to my collection and was happy to see this new female voice. Then I read ""Home."" The basic premise has promise but the execution is strictly hack work. I had to wonder if the book misclassified and was intended for the Young Adult audience. Even pre-teens deserve better than this.""Home"" is a bizarre hybrid of the Nancy Drew novels and the Harlequin Romance series. The characters are one dimensional, at best, and their actions are so random they defy belief. The writing is often cringe-worthy. Where was the editor for this book? Was there an editor? The book reads like the output from a vanity press.If you are a Sci-Fi fan, skip this book. If you are a Harlequin Romance fan and you receive this book for free, it might be worth your time."
3,Author dies at age 25,"This book was written by the recipient of the 1st successful heart-lung transplant at the University of Pittsburgh. She was 9 at the time of her original surgery. Despite additional lung transplants and a complicated health history, she managed to graduate from College and write this book. Its style suffers from the fact that she was a late teenager when it was written. Sadly, she died today (April 9, 2001) at age 25.NOTE- I meant to mark this as 3 Stars. Can not edit it."
3,Smaller is NOT better,An adorable plaque; just way too small. I would have paid more. The description was not accurate.
1,Thid product [IS BAD],"I purchased the eureka steamer a few weeks ago. I tried it once and all it did was spurt water all over my clothes, it never released pure steam. In addition, it would constantly run out of pressure and I would have to wait a minute or two for it to warm back up. This machine is totally useless, I can't believe Eureka would even market this product. I even sent it back thinking it was defective, boy was I wrong. The replacement did the same thing. Please believe me when I said please do not buy this product."
1,really upsetting performance,I did a lot of research. Read all the customer reviews and decided to buy this product. It was utterly disappointing in performance. Except that it exudes steam and makes the floor wet... it does not clean well at all...it is the same as using a mop ....The only good thing i observed is to use it to clean upholstry. I am returning this product asap.
2,The title inspired me but the book did not,"I was disappointed. After reading the glowing customer reviews, I was expecting a lot more inspiration. 143 pages of pictures with very little text, it would be better suited for a pamphlet."
1,Still no Correction to AD,"I have had one of these with the drafting head for about 10 years and can say the drafting head is not as easy to use as those on full size drafting boards and probably not a necessity. But, when you have redundant lines to draw on a given angle, it is nice.I was about to order a second one for home/shop use when I read the comments above and I concur. This borders on bait and switch. Wake up Grizzly, you are better tahn this. Fix the ad and all will be happy."
4,"Bravo ""Kid"" review","Looks good, but I haven't purchased the item -- I whole-heartedly concur with the 3/05 kid review re: accessory shown, not included, and not find-able. Ad lacks sufficient information, is vaguely misleading. Further, it is evident that the company doesn't check/care about/respond to or fix their information based on review(s). I'm writing this approx. 18 months after ""kid"" referred to the missing accessory information--I couldn't find it either."
2,Not Impressed,This is a plastic board in a plastic case with plastic attachments. You can't buy other accessories because the suppliers don't exist any longer. I would not buy this again and I don't recommend it to anyone else.
1,"If I could receive the magazine,","If I could receive the magazine, I'd gladly rate it. I've been waiting close to a month and have yet to get one in the mail."
5,Michigan's Politicians Attempt to Kill Laws Here so.....,"....publications such as these are essential. The growing tips, pictures, articles, everything....are professional, timely, and educational. I don't use, I don't grow, but I have patients who HAVE to have medical marijuana and the information is priceless. Enjoy!"
5,help your children to understand Why people go off to WAR,"This DVD was put together by men who fought in WWII on the Pacific front. After all these years, they take a crew of younger people including their own grandsons and granddaughters back to the beaches where they fought. They explain WHY Iwo was so important to the war effort, why it was worth so many men giving their lives, and how it helped to end the war. They praise God, and also pay tribute to the many who did not live thru the battle.Many times historical accounts of the War fail to focus in on the reasons, what lead up to the war, or to put a face on the conflict. This helps the next generation to learn, and not repeat the mistakes."
3,League,"Though a Well made documentary, it was not what I expected.It wiil probably be well recieved by sons of a veteren,but not the general public"
1,Thin Sheets,"You get what you pay for on these and I should have skipped it...but I've gotten some great deals on Amazon before. However, these sheets were a wash! I can't cry too much because they were inexpensive - but that's exactly how they feel. Thin and cheap. I would not recomend these sheets if you like the higher thread count, luxury feeling. Super 8 and Motel 6 have better sheets than this! Disappointing."
2,Cheap and low quality,"When I read that these sheets were 300 thread count, I expected high quality. In fact, they are seconds. On the top sheet, a rip had been hand-repaired, and not very well. The sheets are thin, wrinkled, and need ironing, even out of the package. They are also very plain. Buy something else unless you just need a cheap set for a cottage or someplace you won't use them often."
4,Great for the price...,Have ordered other sheet sets and I am the least impressed with these. They were on sale and will be great for the price - I was just expecting a thicker sheet. Quality looks good and the feel is great.
4,Egyptian Cotton Sheets,"Very nice quality sheets. Very soft, seem to get softer the more you wash them. Over all, we are pleased with the purchase."
1,Cheapy sheets,"I just received my ivory queen sheet set. Correct color, but they look horrendously cheapy -- usually the threads are so close together you can't see through the fabric, but I swear these threads are so far apart you can see through. A quick rub of the sheets leaves a mess of wrinkles. The stitching is really sloppy but at least it's hidden on the inside of the pillowcases. Also, at least they don't feel scratchy yet. I have not washed them yet -- I'll try to report back on how the sheets fare -- I just wanted to warn people about how cheap these sheets look. If you want quality, don't go here. If you need to just cover your bed, you could go cheaper with flannel or 250 thread count (I bought this set for $19.99)"
4,Good Quality ~ Need an Iron!,I purchased 2 sets of these sheets for my fil. He loves the feel of the sheets BUT the wrinkles are a bit much. I prefer to not have to iron my bedding but if I owned these sheets I would have to iron them or the wrinkles would drive me crazy! The quality of these sheets make them an excellent value for the price which was $24.99 and free shipping.
1,Waste of money,These sheets are not soft and smooth as you would expect from Egyptian Sateen. They are the poorest quality sheets I have ever purchased and after just 3 washes have shrunk where they no longer fit the bed.
3,Review of sheets,Hi: These sheets are very nice - 'almost' flannel. They don't wrinkle that much and a nice color. I recommend.
2,Unimpressed,"The sheets came with a few white spots , like bleach had been spilled on them. After just a few washings, little pill-like balls formed on the sheets. I have had sheets for years that never did this and am not pleased that this happened so quickly after buying them."
2,not practical,"Yes , the sheets are soft but they are so thin, I am afraid they will not hold up in the washing machine. I washed them once , so far so good but I cannot uses these sheets often as they are far too fragile for everyday use."
3,Inexpensive sheets....you get what you pay for,"I gave these sheets 3 stars, only because of their low cost. They aren't really very soft, even after washing them with tons of fabric softener. The sheets come out of the dryer pretty wrinkled, and seem to pill more and more with each washing. The ""dark blue"" color is more like a dark teal, and I would have to say that they sheets are more teal green than dark blue. I was expecting something more like navy blue. Anyhow, I can't complain too much about these, since they were so inexpensive. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Save your money,"I saw the price on these and was so excited! We had 300 t.c. E.C. sheets, but we had gotten a new bed, so we needed a new size. Don't get me wrong, they are not sandpaper, but they certainly are not 300 t.c."
1,Wouldn't buy again,"Despite its claim to being 300-count, these sheets were thin and scratchy. Very uncomfortable to sleep on - returned promptly!"
5,great sheets!,2 weeks ago we were having company and we needed some sheets for the guest bed. at Kmart I paid $40.00 for some Martha Stewart sheets. they were the cheapest they had! they were hard and cheap looking. today I got this set of sheets from Amazon. They are soft. I guess for $12.99 I wasn't expecting much but these are so much better than the $40.00 ones I paid for at kmart. I am pleased with my purchase...
3,Nothing Septacular,"I bought this sheet expecting a quality slightly better than average since I normally buy my bedding at department stores where the thread count is 100-200. This sheet is good for those who like drapey soft sheets. It washed up well and is comfortable, but not my cup of tea. I will be buying something with a higher thread count so that the sheet has some ""umph"" to it."
2,"Cheap price, cheap sheets.","Buy these for your guest room if you need them right away and don't have time to go to a store. Otherwise don't bother.They pill like crazy after one week on the bed and are very thin. I found better sheets for less money in the ""dorm room"" section at Macy's."
1,Pills after the first wash,"I've never had a problem with sheets pilling before, so this was a first. 300 thread count is sort of wasted when there are hard little pills all over the surface. Also, the sheets are very thin."
4,Decent sheets...for a guy,"These sheets are a good price and fit my 15"" mattress and foam topper well. They came out of the dryer looking fine to me but I'm not that particular. A good value."
1,Misleading?,"These sheets were quite thin, and like the label said, needed ""touch-up ironing"" -- on every square inch. I won't accept the excuse that ""you get what you pay for."" I didn't intend to buy $13 sheets. These were sold as $40 sheets marked down to $12.99, but I can't imagine anyone paying $40 for them. This is not what I expect from Amazon."
1,Horrible Sheets,These are the worst set of sheets I have ever had. Even though I washedthem according to the label they have fuzz balls everywhere includingthe pillow cases.
3,300 count sheets,The sheets were as soft as I was told..but I did find that they do shrink some in the wash..I do not use hot water..so didnt expect them to shrink..they still fit but it is a tight fit now..other than that am happy with them..
5,Soft like I wanted,"I purchased this set for my boyfriend for Christmas. After washing, it was soft and comfy. It didn't shrink and I was totally satisfied with how well it fit his double pillow top mattress. It does wrinkle easily if left in the dryer, but if you pull it out and put it on the bed while still warm, it does not. A good value that I would reccommend to anyone looking for a good deal."
4,Great feel!,"This sheet set lived up to my expectations. The fabric is sturdy, yet comfortable and soft. I look forward to years of use."
5,An easy and fun read; enlightening for parents of 2s,"An entertaining and enlightening book, written from the point of view of a two year old. In short chapters sorted by subject (e.g. ""tantrums"", ""socks"", etc.) the author explains why two year olds act so ""weird"" sometimes. As a mother of two-year old twins on the verge of being driven crazy, I found it instructive. It has actually made me more understanding of some of the seemingly irrational reactions I get from my kids."
1,Stupid!,I was hoping for parenting techniques. What I got was a dialogue of feelings. Not very useful. Very disappointed.
4,Wonderful Piece,"Marconi obviously knows what he's talking about. He knows how great publicity is. I'm struggling to get my band into the papers and I'm tryin' and I'm tryin' and I keep getting the hard slap to the face. I mean, how are people gonna know where we're playin'?!I loved this book! I liked Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired more, especially for the net stuff. But, Marconi is a good all-arounder. Totally covers all the stuff from the net to the unnet. Lots o' tips and stuff. Like I said, Marconi knows what he's talking 'bout.Great stuff!"

Jimmie Davis-Nobody's Darling But Mine
3,Easy read but lacks detail.,"This short book is an easy-to-read introduction to basic military life. Its honest straight-forward representation of the military is a refreshing break from the dramatized and occasionally misleading spin of recruiters. The book, however, makes constant reference to what I believe is a more valuable publication for civilians interested in boot camp, or Initial Entry Training (IET). This manual (TRADOC Pam. 600-4) .... It goes into great detail about all the specifics of becoming a soldier, whereas Mr. Thompson's book reviews only the major issues, concerns, fears, and questions new recruits may have."
2,Major Grammatical Errors,"There are at least 20 major grammatical errors throughout this book. The book is somewhat informational, but major grammatical errors are a sign of unprofessionalism. Good book, but not worth the price."
1,this book is fubar,"If you are thinking of joining ANY branch of the military do not read this book. You will be met with choices you need your knowledge for not a book. If you think you need this book you also need a stress card, in which case you shouldn't be here. Being inexperienced is better than this. Keep your mouth shut and your eyes and ears open."
1,"Woo-mama, this book is awful!","I have never in my life found reading to be as painful of an exercise as when I was reading this ""book."" It's so repetitive, it could really be condensed into a small brochure of about 15 pages or less. I mean this book is really bad... after I read the whole thing, I felt like I hadn't learned much more than I already knew from watching the movies. First of all, this book is about the Army, not all branches of the Military - so if you are intrested in the Coast Guard or Navy like I am, this book is a total waste of time. A friend of mine from my graduating class is thinking about going into the Army. He read the first 20 pages of my copy and said he couldn't take it anymore and gave it back to me. I warned him it was awful, but like me, he's trying to learn as much as he can before he enlists."
1,drop and give me my $19.95 back!,"The author should stick to soldiering and not to authoring. I'm sure the author had valuable experience that could be relayed into a helpful book, but he needed a co-author or something. The typos were all over the place and very distracting... but I guess this guy didn't have spell-check on his IBM selectric or whatever this was typed on. Poorly organized and an extremely misleading title.I'd like to see this guy drop and give me just shy of 2000 push ups... one for each penny I paid for this glorified beer coaster."
1,not a good book,"This book was not good. It was poorly organized and had many typos. I did learn a little bit from reading the book, but probably from only a couple of sentences.It's not really a ""military"" guide, but rather an Army guide... the other branches are not included.This book is not worth the paper it's printed on."
5,Only get this if you want to feel better physically and/or emotionally.,"This is a fantastic product. I noticed a difference within 48 hours. It is really helping me with adrenal issues. I get more done and feel less tired! I feel more mentally alert and emotionally more at peace. There are no side effects, no known drug or supplement interactions. It is anti cancer, and helps one lose weight. All these benefits are backed up by research. Where has this product been all my life? Ditch the coffee. Take this adoptogen instead and you will be lifted up without being dumped later - or jittery. If you are wondeirng how much to take, I would say take 1 for a couple of days (not near bedtime) and see what happens. If you don't notice much of a difference (I needed more due to weak adrenals & hypothyroid issues) try two, maybe three like me. Hope it helps you!"
5,Excellent Product,"This is a high quality rhodiola extract,500mg standardized to 3% rosavins, a similar dosage to that used in clinical studies. A good science based review of rhodiola is at: [...]It has a noticeable and very good effect on me (male, 53 yo). It gives improved energy, mood, and tolerance to stress such as that caused by frequent heavy weight training. At the same time, it makes my drive and energy in the bedroom like it was 30 years ago :-)This is the best adaptogenic herb I have ever tried, and at [...] for 60 capsules is also an excellent value. I highly recommend it."
1,No effect,"I took this once a day (one capsule) for about 2 weeks. Based on the other reviews I expected to see something happen well within that time. However, I didn't notice any change whatsoever. Either I didn't take it for long enough or it just doesn't have any effect for some people. It's too bad, because I sure wanted the extra energy other reviewers talk about."
1,Rhodiola for the masses?,"How can a company sell a product that just doesn't do anything, despite the amount of stuff in the capsule? This just doesn't work. It makes you feel all jittery, and that's about it. There are far better products on the market than this one, and I guess Rhodiola must be one of those ""you get what you pay for"" types of products. My doctor recommended Mind Body & Spirit. another Rhodiola, that seems to work very well, but I can't find it here on Amazon. I found out with this NOW product that not all Rhodiola's are the same."
4,Easily integrated into my physiology,"I was pleasantly surprised that the Rhodiola only caused short-term upset in my gastric system. ANYTHING new in my diet usually causes gastric distress for a few weeks, this was less than a week. I believe with continued use the benefits will increase, they are slight but noticable."
3,no real relief nor noticeable help.. FOR ME,"to me just another over-hiped promoted herb that is based on someone elses useage ... may work for you did not for me, and I'm not interested in puting money out to get te doseage needed for a Man 6'5 and 290lbs this is the big rub... all those pushing Natural HERBS base there useage on 17th/18th/19th/ century useage when men/women that where 5ft 3 and weighed 120lbs..."
4,"Una autoridad, buen material, pero no ""monedita de oro""","Aclaración: El dicho popular completo es ""no soy monedita de oro para caerle bien a todos"". Así es este diccionario de la Real Academia Española (DRAE).Aunque es ya un clásico y una autoridad entre personas cultas de habla hispana, no es una obra que mereciera el título de ""completa"" o ""instructiva para todos"".Por ejemplo, otros diccionarios como el Clave, contienen más términos que el DRAE; no obstante, lo toman como referencia indicando cuáles no están aceptados aún por la Academia.Ahora bien, ambos diccionarios presentan la falta de ilustraciones (en lo que es muy bueno el Larousse), aunque no de ejemplos.Mi recomendación: Adquieran el DRAE si van a usar (citar, leer, escribir) español ""autorizado"" o reconocido por la Academia; busquen otro si les interesa una colección más amplia de vocablos o si prefieren ilustraciones."
5,A needed tool if you plan to work with the Spanish language,"The Diccionario de la Real Academia Española is considered by some as the highest authority in the Spanish language: not only represents the language used in Spain, but since all Spanish-speaking countries have a ""Real Academia de la lengua"" (Royal Academy of Language) of their own, and they are all in sync, this dictionary represents the language of the more than 20 countries where Spanish is spoken, and even includes de U.S. Therefore, you won't find a better dictionary around at this price. I believe it could be a little longer, but it contained most--if not all--the words I was looking for. Highly recommended if you use or plan to use Spanish very often. If you are simply a college student minoring in Spanish, don't bother, go and purchase something else."
2,¡Está muy chiquito!,"¡Ojo! Este diccionario tiene las dimensiones más pequeñas que otros, y por lo tanto, las letras de las definiciones son difíciles de leer hasta ser casi ilegibles. Tampoco tiene palabras que se usa cotidianamente en latinoamerica, que tal vez vienen de otras lenguas pero que han ido incorporadose a lo largo del tiempo en la lengua española. ¡No es lingüisticamente actualizado! Debe ser renombrado a ""diccionario de la lengua en España"". El mundo latinoaméricano debe de acabar con la ilusión de que la Real Academia es la mejor autoridad de la lengua española. El problema es que no hay otra institución que se dedica específicamente a estos aspectos a la lengua.... Entonces, compramos lo que tenemos. :("
2,Imposible de leer,Compré este libro como regalo para mi madre y me lo devolvió a los tres días. La tipografía usada en las pequeñas páginas es tan minúscula que aún con un vidrio de aumento es difícil de leer. Todos los que lo han visto concuerdan que el formato pequeño del libro es totalmente inadecuado para un diccionario de esta magnitud.
3,"""Esta informacion esta en la pagina web www.rae.es""","El diccionario de la Real Academia de la Lengua Espaniola es una fuente muy completa de informacion sobre el idioma castellano/hispano... el contenido del CD es lo mismo que esta en la pagina web gratis de la Academia asi que creo que a menos que usted no tenga acceso al internet, no hay diferencia."
1,Diccionario De LA Lengua Espanola (2-Volume Set),"Amazon practiced ""Bait and Switch"" on my order of this item - Diccionario de la Real Academia Espanola. They advertise the July 2002 Edition and they shipped the 2001 Edition (ISBN# 84-239-6814-6), twice! Their ""Customer Service"" acknowledged this was a catalog department mistake. Their website indicates Amazon inventories the 2002 Edition (ISBN# 84-239-6813-8) but ""Customer Service"" claimed they did not have any. Bottom line, Amazon did not honor their advertising.A frustrating experience that took three months, countless emails (they do not talk to customers on the phone) and my last with Amazon."
2,academia de ******,"No pierde la riqueza anterior pero, a pesar de haberse podido desarrollar plenamente con la ayuda de los métodos informáticos, sigue estando lleno de incoherencias, remisiones falsas, remisiones circulares... Afortunadamente, al menos ha empezado a abrir la puerta al español de América."
1,Deceptive picture,"The ballast, as listed in the title, arrived promptly, and for all I know, probably works. But GreenBeam shows this ballast by itself on some other Amazon pages for less money, so I asked my son to order from this particular page because I need the whole assembly as shown here--I can't use just the ballast. Am working with Amazon on a return & refund--hope GreenBeam changes the picture to show just the ballast."
5,TERRIFIC!!,"Couldn't stop watching it. Absolutely wonderful program. If you liked ""Mission: Impossible"" with a WW2 spin, you will love this program. The characters are very well written and superbly acted. You will love to hate Clifford Rose as Kessler, head of the Gestapo in Brussels."
1,Doesn't do ANYTHING!!!,This product does nothing WHATSOEVER!!! I've taken this product for a total of 6 months already and no improvement. My breasts stayed the exact same size 6 months ago. You can feel it working but it really doesn't work AT ALL!!!!
5,Im very pleased,Afte taking this for around 2 weeks my breast have got sore but not bad and my breast are fuller. I use these with Breast Success. I just altranate them with each dose. Alltogether 4 pills a day. Yes i will continue to take them and I will give another update in about a month.
1,Don't purchase!,I took three bottles of this produce religiously but I didn't see any increase in breast size. Not taking enough was not the issue either because I would take 2 of them 3-4 times a day. These pills are a waste of money and time so I don't suggest getting them.
3,it's ok,I used Bio-Bust cream for women with it and did a chest work out and I had a small change I wasn't happy with the end results I ended up getting implants but it did give me about a size more than what I started with so if you are look for a a cup increase buy it if you want more than that this product is not for you. You can find chest exercises on the website for the cream or just google chest exercises and find 1 that works for you.
2,Not sure WHAT to think?????,I have been taking these pills faithfully for 6 weeks.... every day I take 9 because I wanted to speed up the process..Well my boobs kind of feel a little fuller but not noticing a change....I am starting to get pimples which I never get...BUT I am in a better mood since I have been taking these...So I guess something good has come out of this..I just bought 2 more bottles so I will finish them and if there's no change I am done with them...I might try some other brand I am not giving up...I will write back and let you know if anything changes....
4,It's not bad..,It works. I tried it for over a month. At first it was a slow progress.. But I realized on my 2nd bottle I took a pill every 5 hours and noticed it was working a bit better.
1,hate it,I hated this gum and have gone through maybe 5 pieces. I couldn't even chew it for very long bc it would start to taste really bad and burn my throat. I would not recommend this gum to anyone. I ended up doing it cold turkey and if i can do it you can do it :)
5,2 months and no cigs thanks to this gum,"Almost 60 days with no cigarettes, but I chew this gum like it's going out of style. Tastes good, controls the cravings, last a long while, arrived very quickly. I think I'll switch to the subscribe and save and stick with this gum for a few more months until I trust myself not to light up again.I tried the generic alternatives and you get what you pay for. The other gum burns your mouth, loses its taste in a few minutes and is too strong to keep in your mouth for long."
4,Stonewall's Pathfinder,"Stonewall Jackson's successful career can, in part, be directly attributed to his gifted topographer, Jedediah Hotchkiss; a man with a gifted eye for terrain. Whether as mapmaker, pathfinder, courier or staff officer, Hotchkiss continuously complimented his talented commander. To understand Jackson, one should know Hotchkiss; Miller's volume, particularly when taken in conjunction with Hotchkiss' own MAKE ME A MAP OF THE VALLEY, certainly facilitates understanding of Jackson's campaigns. Miller clearly delineates Hotchkiss' many skills in an easily read text supported by beautiful full-color renditions of some of Jed's maps, meanwhile teaching the reader a great deal about military topography, map-making and the Civil War in the East. Any student of Jackson, the Valley Campaign, or Civil War staff operations should have this book. A well-done, lovely book about one of the war's most interesting characters."
2,a little bit thin,"This was not a strong installation in this informative and user-friendly series. It was great to see that for which doctors are searching in colorectal exams. Also, the work speaks of the stages of the cancer and why individuals should be checked early so as to fight the illness most effectively. They then show men and women of various ages who have been affected by the disease. Still, it just didn't say much. I thought more could have been done in this program."
3,"Pro Spooks and Goblins, Anti UFO","Large amount of material which reads fairly well but isnt what I expected. The author seems determined through out the book to doubt or debunk most of the UFO cases and isnt objective in her opinions. BUT then she presents many UFO cases as mistaken cases of ghosts, fairies and spirits and as if this explanation is the gospel. You cant have it both ways lady!!"
3,Lots of info,"You know, this book gave in details lots and lots of cases of ufo sightings and alien contact around the world. Some I have never heard before, I really like the reading.."
5,Really is a great best of collection,"I know this will get passed over because it is a budget priced collection, and it has no liner notes at all. But the sound is really superb and the selections are right on, for the most part. If you've got the money, the two Ace collections are the way to go, but if you're on a tight budget, this collection can't be beat for strictly musical value."
3,"Sorry, not the best of the Masqueraders!","Sorry, I disagree with the editorial comment here. I have this CD but I think the best recordings the Masqueraders did were on their 1975 album ""Everybody Wanna Live On"" which was produced by Issac Hayes on the Hot Buttered Soul label. ""Baby It's You"" is good enough to have been a top ten R&B hit and ""(Call Me) The Traveling Man"" was close. These are the two best songs they ever recorded. But also on the same album ""Honest and True"" and ""Your Sweet Love Is A Blessing"" are really excellent too. It's a great shame more people don't know about them because I think they were really good. I guess they were too little known to get exposure even with Issac Hayes behind them at the time. I also like ""Modern Day Woman"" from their ""Love Anonymous"" 1977 follow-up album on Hot Buttered Soul. Sad to say, neither of these albums are available on CD and probably there are not many vinyl copies in existence."
1,just plain useless and dangerous,"I have had a Oxo tea kettle for years so I bought this one for a friend. The very first time we used it we noticed two things...the whistle is uselessly quiet (what happened to the rich train-like sound?!) and worse, this kettle right out of the box had a leak at the seam where the spout meets the body splashing boiling water all over.Frankly, I have noticed the quality of many Oxo products slipping drastically lately and I won't be buying them again. What ever happend to their quality?!"
4,"Rest in peace, little teakettle.","Great teakettle. Sadly, I highly recommend that you NOT inadvertently leave it on a stove burner turned on high while it's empty. Instead of the burner with the pot of water that you actually wanted to boil :\After only a few months of use, however, this is definitely the best teakettle I'd ever used. Very nifty feature where the spout opens if you tip it down (pouring) and closes when you tip it back up (done pouring). Nice red color, good paint job, nice grippy handle (thanks OXO) and no complaints so far, other than the fact that I stupidly burned it up on the stove while groggily trying to boil some eggs."
1,Didn't beleive the bad reviews,When I bought this kettle there weren't many bad reviews. As I can see this has changed... I had the same problem as some of the users: plastic spout cover began to melt around the edges and today the whole thing broke. I just can't belive they make a kettle that doesn't resist heat (And I was extra careful with it).... I'll try to send and e-mail to oxo just to let them know how I fell
1,Piece of Junk,Cheap construction. Hollow plastic cap melted and cracked after about 5 months of daily use! Frightening.
1,Breaks after Brief Use,"Using this daily for only two months caused the plastic on the spout cap to deteriorate and chip away. Finally, the entire cap broke off. It's a shame, because I liked its design and feel."
1,Imparted yucky metallic taste,"For some reason, after 4 or 5 uses, this teapot started imparting a nasty metallic taste to any water boiled in it. I noticed that the lid smelled strongly metallic. I see no other reviewers report this problem, so perhaps it was limited to the ""batch"" produced when mine was produced. I returned it and purchased a different type."
2,Looks Great but Spout Melted,I love the way this kettle looks but the spout cover has now melted after being used 1-3 times a month for about 10 months. The whistle no longer works so you have to stand over the kettle waiting for the water to boil. Time to get a replacement...of a different brand.
2,Mine broke too.,The whistle broke after 6 months and the spout came lose with some sort of glue comming out of it. I continued using it until the lack of whistle meant I left it on the stove and the enamble burned it permantly to the burner. I had to replace it and the burner.
5,Great tea kettle,"This is a good looking design, has a nice rubber grip, whistles well and has a large surface area for quick heating. I bought it as a gift for my wife and she hasn't had any problems with it."
1,Melted!!,"The plastic whistle and spout cover MELTED during regular use. I put the kettle on to boil and it never whistled, so I went to check it and the whole whistle contraption had melted and was dripping down the teapot!! I emailed the company and they promised to send me another one but I am very dubious about using it, why would a new one be any different? But we'll see...at least they said they would replace it."
2,the rhythms were offbeat,"I seem to be at odds with most of the other reviewers who thought the book started slow and later picked up speed. I personally was rather intrigued with the beginning and very interested in Cora's story. I agree with the Publisher's Weekly review that it could have been a great characterization of Cora and her struggles, but it passed over many years to start the story of Emma and quickly became uneven and full of holes. The part of Parris was so short and uninteresting compared to the other two that I believe even Ms. Hill grew bored with her rambling story and just wanted to hurry up and finish it. For a more well-written (minus the empty fluff) generational story of mothers and daughters, read Cane River by Lalita Tademy or the Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan"
3,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"This was the worst book I've read by Donna. The story was much too sad. I personally feel that this story would've been much more interesting if David and Cora had gotten back together at least while she was still in her thirties. Hopefully, they would probably have their own children and make up for some of the lost. Now that Cora is gone, David doesn't really have anyone to remember her by. Although Parris love David to death, looking at her is always going to be a constant reminder of what could've been. There is nothing like your own.As a fan of Donna Hill, I will not let one book discourage me. After all,I've read all her books and this was my first and only disappointment."
4,Rhythms,A really refreshing read. Donna Hill's writing style is reminiscent of a modern Zora Neale Hurston. It is great when a book actually touches your heart because the characters and storyline is so well thought out. I recommend that every booklover read it.
5,"Excellent story of triumph,success and forgiveness",The author did an outstanding job of flowing the novel in a way that it captured my heart and could not wait to read what would happen with the next generation. At the end she connected all and showed how a strong foundation of love from family takes a person a long way. I cried at the end ..touch my heart like I knew Cora and her family. I was happy when David and Cora got back together. I thoroughly enjoyed this book!!!!!!!I wish there was a sequel.
2,Bad from the Demo,I just played the demo on my 1.6 Ghz with GeForce 3 and the game was all choppy even at the lowest settings. The combat was very tedious too. I tried to shoot an enemy throught a thin wooden table with an MP5 and it didn't even go through. Hopefully the final game will be improved.
2,So so kinda game.,"This game really doesn't have a replay value as like Medal of honor:AA, one reason is theres no multi player mode where you can play others online, that woulda been cool. As for the graphics goes, it was done very nicely and clean. I guess what killed it for me is the additional levels added to the game didn't really if none at all, fit the movie senario. But they were still fun to explore. Like many have already mention, the ending was terrible. Think god I use a god mode cheat all throughout the game, b/c if you swet it out throughout this game your gonna get a rude awaking when you see the simple to short ending cutscene. The only interesting thing about this game is the attention to detail of the levels, and it was fun to explore them."
2,not so happy,the thing i dont like about it is i have to wait for several minutes before i can fill the tank again with water. also it takes awhile for it to heat up. but since i already have it i might as well use it. it works well though once it heats up
2,waste of money,"This didn't clean anything that a good sponge wouldn't clean, and it took more time. Didn't do a gread job on anything I tried it on (bathroom, kitchen). In fact, after I used it, I had to use a sponge to clean up the mess it had made. The sponge was able to remove everything that the steamer wasn't Waste of time looking at this, waste of time buying it, waste of time trying to use it."
2,I burnt my hand 3 times,I had high expectations but everytime I try to use it the hose twist off and dumps hot water on me. It definatly dosn't really steam anything off. Holding down the button is a pain. I wish there was a latch to hold it down. Your better off scrubbing it yourself. It suppose to save you time but creates a bigger mess then you started.
2,"Great idea, not so great results","Good product for cleaning not so tough stains. Not so great in the bathroom. May be useful for killing bacteria, no way to tell. Pretty much a disappointing product."
1,"I don't think is that ""Hot"".","This enviro steamer is too expensive for what it really does. To clean a small area of tile in my shower I had to put water 3 times because the Hot Shot's water tank is too small. This steamer doesn't really remove grease or mildew by itself without scrubbing like they advertise on TV. The handle is not ""hand"" friendly. After a little while my hand started hurting and I couldn't hold the darn thing straight because it kept sliding. If I would have known that this gadget wasn't going to be worthwhile I wouldn't have bought it."
3,Not so hot HotShot,"I liked the idea of steam cleaning to eliminate bacteria and other germs but it seems to shoot water all over the place. It also doesn't remove dirt or grime from tile or vinyl. The window squeegee doesn't really work either; it just pushes the dirt around. Basically,it is good for sterilizing areas without the use of chemicals but you do have to use chemicals to remove stains and a sponge to wipe up the excess water."
3,Useful hints and tips,"This book is all about getting your bike, whatever make, the best looking possible.Although a lot of methods described might be common sense to you, still I found a couple of useful hints and tips how to clean or polish a specific part of my bike.You really got to be into detailing and getting your bike into concours-state to be able to use all contents of the book.Also cleaning and care of your clothes and helmet is discussed.Most products described are US-oriented, but when you look through the product names and extract the methods to to a specific job, you can find similar products outside the US of A.For this price, a nice and usefull book.Now stop reading and go polish your bike!"
4,Pretty good,"I liked this compilation, it has all the hits I was looking for. I am not a hard core fan, so this is good enough for me."
5,They'll be there for you,"Ascension's Right Hand is a book about the allies of mages. It is a rather old book before Mage Second Addition but it still has a lot useful information. The book explores the personalities behind the Allies/Familiar Background of Mages. Allies for all the Traditions, Technocracy, Marauders, and Nephandi were detailed. There was a slight emphasis on the allies of the Traditions but that was expected. At the time of the release, they were the only PC-friendly group available. A lot of the material regarding normal human companions is not new but the information on supernatural custos, like familiars, is really useful. This book is great for people interested in playing a toned down game where there is less of an emphasis on destroying things with kewl powerz, but one that focuses more on survival and loyalty."
5,More than Singing,"Rosemary Clooney once said that she was only a member of the band, but she was also the only one with the words. That sums up this recording. Ms. Patti sings in and around fabulous orchestrations and mixing that has left the ""live"" feel of the two performances that were recorded, but the applause and other background noise often associated with a live recording are not there, resulting in tracks that are wonderful and familiar to the ear, even when it's just the band. In all, this is a deluxe package from Ms. Patti, who should be very proud."
3,Could have been better.,"Given that it's Patti Austin it's not unfair to expect a lot. Unfortunately, she misses the mark here. As expected there is nothing technically wrong with the album, it's just that the arrangements are lackluster, and the song pairings don't really work.Incredible voice though."
3,I miss Patti in the current day,"First I love Patti Austin, and there is far from anything wrong with this cd. It's just that..well..like the Ella Cd, it just doesn't exicte me. I miss the Patti Austin who brought me songs like ""I will Remember You"" and ""Somebody Make Me Laugh, Somebody make me cry"", & ""In and Out of Love"" just to name a very few.I know those cds didn't sell that much, and I am sure she can get a lot more work singing Gershwin so a girl gotta do, what a girl gotta do and with her vocal chops she can sing anything, I just miss the ole patti."
1,Summary Judgment Flop....Don't Waste Your Coin,"I think this ""book"" has less than a dozen pages of information. I bought it in hopes it would give a self-representing civil party an insight to writing effective Motion's For Summary Judgment.....Oooooops! Wrong book for that.......This 12 page phamphlet outlines the statistics of three Federal courts in regard to how many Summary Judgments were filed, won, denied...etc."
5,Wow,"I saw this movie originally on TV and automatically was captivated by it. It deals with heavy issues, and really is such an amazing movie. Recommended if you're into psychological genres and have the desire to really be moved by a movie :)"
1,Do not order this item from Amazon.,"Ordered this item from amazon a month ago and continued to get weekly updates saying there was a delay in shipping. Finally they told me they couldn't ship it and cancelled my order. Service was terrible because I couldn't cancel the order due to it being in the ""shipping process"", but the item never shipped. Not giving this product a bad review just amazon's customer service."
1,not worth the price,"I can just say that in recent years I found I like her books less and less, than again maybe it's just me.Woman that will let a man step all over them are not really my taste, it is no longer a fantasy its just pitiful and painful."
4,remarkable story,"this is a wonderful story that touches all who reads it. It is amazing to think what one can accomplish. Beautifully written, and told."
5,Talent and benjamin,"This album is great, strong and melodic enough to make you let it repeat whole at least 3 times in a row, it's so good And yes has great sound quality, i have 2 15"" bazookas in my car with sweet speakers and the sound it's so rich and strong, love this band, quality people, quality!!!"
4,GREAT CD bonus DVD,"Love their album phobia, breaking benjamin definantly records great music onto their albums. Most of the songs they have on their disc sounds incredible so I decide to check out the DVD that comes with the album. Perhaps it was that particular show I dont know.. but I must say that I expected more in their live performance on the DVD, but the DVD is good none the less."
2,Too bad,"I was expecting something great like Saturate or We Are Not Alone. I mean there are about 4 enjoyable songs (that are not amazing) and everything else sucks!!! So buy at your own risk, only worth buying if you love Breaking Benjamin."
2,sad boring cd,"if you want to hear talent? listen to the new stone sour cd... much heavier and proven to surpass its original. Breaking Benjamins new cd has one great song on it and thats the diary of jane. I even told my girlfriend that I was nervous about this cd, and she said why? I told her thats because BB always releases great singles but they never release great cd's except for saturate. wow they have declined downhill and I was not impressed at all. they are a good band yes indeed, but this is not worth the listen, unless u are new to rock music, this might be a good starter. dont put to much time into this album, especially when one song tells the tale-- diary of jane... no more one hit wonder albums please"
2,Too bad!!!!,"I was hoping that this would be great. I loved We Are Not Alone and Saturate so I expected something really good. I was very dissappointed, because this album only has a couple good songs (You,Diary of Jane,Breath) and everything else is just really ordinary and boring!!! I mean this album is not terrible , but its just not really worth buying (unless your willing to spend like $[...] on 3 songs). I would however recommend We Are Not Alone or Saturate to anybody!!"
5,New Music Review,"Great album, great band I only wish that I had heard of them earlier. I will be buying their other albums very soon."
5,Addictive,"After hearing BB's previous hits from We Are Not Alone, I expected this album to be similar. However it's not; at first, I found some of the songs to be boring, but after listening to them a few times, I grew to appreciate them. My favorites include ""Dance with the Devil"" and ""Unknown Soldier"", with its strong chorus and instrumentals. The songs on this album are more, for lack of better word, well-structured (many instrumentals overlayed with the voice often matching them), and less angry. Overall, it's more melodious but it still possesses BB's meaningful lyrics and catchiness ;-)."
5,Incredible,"After setting the bar high with ""We Are Not Alone,"" Breaking Benjamin continues with their follow up, ""Phobia."" Personally, I was not expecting what I heard. This album competes with if not surpasses WANA. BB's vocals have evolved to near perfection. Their distict and unique sound just works.Must check out these tracks.3. Breath6. Until the End2. The Diary of Jane"
3,Breaking Benjamin's Junior Outing,"I was amazed that after Saturate BB was able to put together ANOTHER great album in the form of ""We Are Not Alone""...However, after listening to the whole disc, Phobia is easily my least favorite BB cd. It just sounds to plain with not enough hooks and the singer ruins most of the songs by singing in his gay voice...which up until now affected only very few BB songs (rain, etc...) Anyway, the remake of Topless is EASILY a 5 star bad@$$ song that sounds like it was ripped straight off of Saturate.I love it....the rest of the album...ehhh, nothin special."
3,3.5 Stars,Of course not nearly as good as their first 2 but definately lots of good songs and definately worth the buy. Hopefully their next one will be better and they aren't going to get worse. I do like the majority of the songs on here but most aren't mind blowing like a lot on their first two cds. Saturate is their best so new fans need to start there.
5,Keep on rolling,It took me two weeks to adjust to their different style that is utilized by Breaking Benjamin before I enjoyed the creativity and patience that went into the making of this album. It is easy to be a critic. To break into the music Industry is a story of success or failure. This Album contains a broad range of various variety which has been added between the tracks as we all enjoy another Album well recorded by Breaking Benjamin.
4,Its still breaking benjamin,"This is not there best but hey its still BB. Its not near as hard as they were in ways. Its still worth buying or maybe a quick download. Anyway i would recommend onlly if you are a fan . If you are not a fan yet and want to no the real breaking benjamin get We Are Not Alone, its the greatest"
3,Well...,"It doesn't quite have the edge of ""We Are Not Alone,"" but it stands on its own. Breaking Benjamin delivers solid rock music, and if you're tired of the omnipresent Nickleback sound, then give this a try.Best song pick: Breath. (""You take the breath right out of me / You left a hole where my heart should be / You gotta fight just to make it through / 'Cause I will be the death of you"" - beautiful song, I really felt it.)"
3,Good CD from the Wilkes-Barre Quartet,"LOVE this band! They are awesome. They remind me of Godsmack when they first started out. Such a great sound; not too heavy but def. rock! And pretty unknown about four years ago.Love ""Saturate."" ""We Are Not Alone"" is an excellent follow-up. ""Phobia,"" however, has a few slower tracks. I like the songs ""Breath, ""Topless,"" and ""Had Enough."" ""Diary...."" is decent. I hope the next CD they put out sounds a lot heavier throughout.Saw them live years ago with Saliva and they sounded great so def. check them out if you can."
2,Breaking Benjamin has sold themselves out,"Want some good music? Check out their earlier albums, We Are Not Alone and Saturate, because this is not the Breaking Benjamin I know and love. This is Breaking Benjamin gone emo after having sold themselves out. With the exceptions of The Diary of Jane, Until the End, and Broken Soul, this could be one of the most disappointing, as well as misleading, albums I have ever listened to. Breaking Benjamin went mainstream after the release of Sooner or Later in late 2004, and their fame has obviously taken it's toll. Breath was the big hit off this album... but, in my opinion, this song was just okay. The entire album gives me that impression. They've gone from the highest of high to... well, I'm not sure about the lowest of low, but pretty far down there.Shame. They are following in the footsteps of Slipknot, Atreyu, Taproot, Staind, and possibly Seether and Trapt; were once owned by their passion of music, now they're owned by the record label."
2,What happened?,"Minus one star right off the bat for having a lame intro and outro. Diary of Jane is the only great song on this album. 2 or 3 good songs, and the rest just sounds so generic and uninspired. We Are Not Alone was a great album and so was Saturate. It sounds like the energy was lost in this album. I'm not counting the band out yet, but if you want your BB fix stick with the first two albums."
4,An honest (short) review,"Like most people who enjoyed Breaking Benjamin's past efforts (mainly We Are Not Alone), I was a bit surprised to hear the shift in sound. Phobia showcases a softer, more melodic breaking benjamin, with emphasis on strong, hooky chorus' and vocals. If you think back to staind's transition from dysfunction and break the cycle to 14 shades of grey, you'll get a pretty good idea of where Breaking Benjamin went with Phobia. It's more accessible, less aggressive, and very catchy.All these long, editorial style reviews need to stop. These are the facts. Use them to make a decision for yourself. The End."
4,A good listen,"Diary of Jane is definitely the most prominent song on the cd, but all of the songs are pretty good. It is a mellow cd so pick something else up if you want something with a little more kick."
5,"""Phobia"" is the best album of 2006!!!","Wow! When I first heard this CD I knew that it was the best album of 2006!!! I love all of the songs on here! My favorite one is ""YOU."" It is a good song! But I really love the whole CD!"
2,Overrated,"This album as a whole is more polished than ""We Are Not Alone"" (for instance, someone stopped the singer from doing that ""hiccup"" sound at the end of a lot of his lines), but is really more of the same. The hooks (which are important with this kind of ""radio-rock"") aren't as catchy, and the lyrics aren't great. Plus, you've already heard the best two songs on the radio. I hope the next one is better, cause I like their sound."
2,It's (Almost) All Filler,"There are two singles on this 13 track LP entitled ""Phobia"".Can you spot them? Listen real hard...You're right! The Diary Of Jane and Breathe are both singles.As for the rest of Phobia, let's just say that calling it cheap, disposable, ""anyone could write a hook like that"" GARBAGE is being more than fair.I had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming by the time Topless hit. Could the once untouchable Breaking Benjamin really reduce themselves to such an awful, boring sound?Everything that made these guys unique is gone on Phobia. Following Breathe, the album takes a turn for the worst one song after another. It's generic, yes, but generic can also sometimes be listenable. Save for the obvious two singles, I hope I never have to listen to anything on Phobia again."
4,Phobia,"Nice. Very nice. Prior to purchase, was familiar with only 2 tracks on this album.Remainder of tracks all very good. Very satisfied with this purchase."
4,Great Album,If you're looking for a full review check out the top rated ones or the Spotlight review. I just wanted to say that I love this album and I think it quite possibly is Breaking Benjamin's strongest album to date.
3,Breaking Benjamin's Break Into My Head,"The first single ""The Diary Of Jane"" is amazing! I am always listening to it."
2,Poop,"Its Poop, and ""poop"" is the only word befitting this perversion of music. Originality is but a faint glimmer behind the facade of this release. A trained monkey with a ukelele can dance circles around Phobia. FYI...my only PHOBIA is that I won't get my money back when I return it. Cliche garbage."
1,Great! If all you listen to is ballads.............,This has been a year of disappointing music and Breaking Benjamin is no exception. This album is just one slow song after another. The only song that sounds like Breaking Benjamin is Diary of Jane. The rest is basically one ballad after another. There are no real rock songs on here. I have been a fan since Saturate and loved We are not alone as well but let's face it these guys dropped the ball on this one. Do not support this cd so Breaking Benjamin can get back to making excellent cds like I know they can.
4,Great for any fan of the movies,"If you've ever wanted to play as a predator or a alien than this is the game for you. There are 3 campaigns The marine, the alien, and the predator.The graphics aren't great but there ok. This game also has one of the best multiplayer. However people that use AIMBOTs or wall hacks can really ruin the experience which is why I usally only play with my friends"
5,Awesome,Great game especially if you are an Alien fan or Predator fan. Its like three games in one. This game is a classic.
4,Very good game but could be longer.,"Aliens vs. Predator 2 is a very very good game, but it could use some improvements. First off the graphics could be better, I know it's made in 2001 but it could have been better. Second, I should have been longer. Each campaign was 7 levels long and it could have at least 10-12 levels long.ENTERTAINMENT 10/10STORY 7/10GAMPLAY 10/10CONTROLS 10/10GRAPHICS 6/10SOUND 9/10OVERALL 8.5/10You can find me on YouTube if you want to see game-play, Subscribe![...]"
4,Amazing Graphics and Atmosphere,"This game is engrossing but can be difficult for a beginner. Favorite parts include playing for long blocks of time looking for clues, going through tunnels, reading memos left behind and evesdropping on conversations, etc. Least favorite parts are where the aliens kill you from what seems like twenty feet away in all directions."
2,too easy to cheat,"The game itself is very good. But the multiplayer version has two major drawbacks.1- the game server is abysmally slow such that the game does not play in anything like real time.2- there are far too many people who install game mods to maketheir characters faster and invincible. If you don't care to learn the programming necessary to install mods, you are justcannon fodder in multiplayer."
3,Amazing Graphics and Atmosphere But Too Difficult,"This game is so difficult that it is hard to sustain any consistent and meaningful interaction without being killed. I freely admit that I am not a game fanatic and don't have much skill at all; what led me to this game was my fascination with the ""Alien"" movies. My favorite parts of the game are where the player plays for long blocks of time looking for clues, going through tunnels, reading memos left behind and evesdropping on conversations, etc. My least favorite are where the aliens kill you from what seems like twenty feet away in all directions, which I find very hard to defend against, and you have to keep going back again and again to try to survive that battle. It get's frustrating and, for me, defeats the suspenseful and sometimes terrifying mood that the game creates."
5,THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD,"you have to buy this game. seriously, it's the best game ever. if you ever get bored playing you can always switch species and it's like a totally dif game, it's awesome. you'll love it."
3,Over in Five Minutes,"True, this game is far superior to it's predecessor,but it is also too short, like it's predecessor. Whythe hell can't they get it right??? MAKE A GAME THATLASTS LONGER THAN ONE DAY."
5,fun once you get past the bugs,I love this game but it wasnt always that way i had a bad time with the bugs but the patches came out and its great this game rocks a must buy it should be bug free now but you must play this game its creepy
3,"Hook up those pair of head phones, turn off the lights..","... and be ready to scream louder that you ever have screamed before. Well, at least for the first 3rd of the game. I was looking for a good scary game, heard of this game, and picked it up. Indeed, few games have scared me more than the marine campaign of this game, if the makers just made that campaign longer and kept the different races in multiplayer, I just might be happy with my 30 dollar purchase of this game. The predator & alien campaigns are just bad compared to the marine one. For many reasons too, it is well paced, has a memorable main character, and it is SCARY. I screamed almost every single time an alien popped up onscreen. You might want to pick up the game, because of the low price is charging it. I think it is a dissapointment"
1,Not ready for release,"This game was obviously rushed out to market. It is very buggy and there are numerous problems. Unfortunately, Sierra is doing a very poor job of providing technical support to those of us foolish enough to have purchased the game. I have been trading e-mails for nearly 2 weeks and we're no where near having this game running. It is not a matter of having an underpowered PC since I easily exceed the hefty system requirements.I, for one, will be seeking a refund for this game. Avoid this game until a gold release comes out. It will be cheaper a appropriately patched by that time (I hope!)."
3,Ok but needs graphical updates.,"I had gotten this game the day it came out. Since then i've beaten the alien levels 13 times, predator 17, and marines 7. There were a tremendous number of slow-downs, and the graphics need a huge update, mostly the character models. The sound effects and voice acting are stunning, most of the time. The ships that occasionally fly above your head when your a predator are awesome! The predator's special visions are cool to have. I found the predator campaign to be much to easy! There are cheat codes for this game, but they don't work for the alien. The graphical chugging is the main issue. I've had to restart my computer at least 30 times because of this game! The gore in the game is pretty realistic but cool. Overall this game is mostly fun but won't give that much gameplay. If you want cheat codes for this game try cheat planet.com. And remember, watch LOST."
4,Aliens vs. Predator 2 good game,"This game is a soggy dream come true for Aliens and Predator fans such as myself. And offers enough gameplay and variety for the standard Quake gunner who needs an action fix. The main thing that kept me liking this game was its story, which was cleverly thought out by monolith in the various cutscenes and readable files that were found. Even though I do wonder how this game fits into the Alien and Predator timelines, because mentioned in the last alien movie Perez said that Ripley wiped the alien species out. And to correct one of the editorial reviews, it was lv-426 that the derelict was found on, not lv-1201..."
4,A much improved game rather than the original!,"THis is a fantastic game!ALien and predator is the best!Screw the marine, damnit, sure it's easier, but the alien and predator rock!get this game, it's more than worthit!"
5,excellent game.,"older game......but still fun...no matter if you play Marine, Predator or Alien. Can't wait for the new Colonial Marines game coming soon!!"
2,I was a bit disapointed.,"After reading so many good reviews of this game I went out and bought it. It is possible that my review is biased in that I only played the game for 2 days but frankly it just isn't enjoyable enough to make me want to play more. There are many interesting ideas included here and it had great potential which was lost in the actual game play and level design. The interface although fairly intuitive leaves somthing to be desired. The level design is fairly standard fare for FPS games, the usual save often instead of use your head ... I can not say if the multi-player was well done becouse I have already moved on to another title. People who are great fans of FPS games will probably enjoy it regardless of its flaws. But for the rest of us aside from a few graphic improvments and some cool licenceing concepts you might as well just blow the dust off your old copy of doom, and re install it ..."
3,Could be good.....,This is probly a great game and looks very good. I had been looking at this game for a while before I finaly decided to buy it. I was very excited as I got ready to play....after waiting about an hour for it too install and than another half an hour for it to start up I started the predator mission. It took FOREVER for it too load before I got too play.The grpahics are wonderfull and everything looks really cool however after about two minutes of gameplay the frame rate dropped and it became a digital nightmare. I tried it several times before giving up and returning it to the store(I attempted to start up the alien and terran missions which I never even got going).This game is probly very good and a great FPS(the little I have played of it is great) but make sure you have good enough techonlogy and grpahics cards etc. So if your computer is strong enough get this game but if not than try somethign else.
5,Scary!,"I just finished the first level, and I say this game is awesome!I was literally leaning back in my chair in fright as I was being attacked by a series of aliens, while trying to fend them off. The entire look, feel, and sound is captured perfectly in this game - including the sounds that the predator makes, the aliens, and the pulse cannon from the Aliens 2 movie. Since I first saw the movie I always wanted to experience this universe. You can too."
3,3 Books on Learning FrontPage 2003,"I actually bought 3 books: Microsoft FrontPage 2003 Step-by-Step, Microsoft FrontPage 2003 Inside-Out, and Que Special Edition Using FrontPage 2003.Step-by-step is a very useful starting point, but you'll soon run out of this book. By far, the best of the 3 is Que's Using FrontPage 2003 - it is excellent! FrontPage 2003 Inside-Out is good IF you're interested in Active Server Pages.But all in all - if you want to buy just one I recommend Que Special Edition Using FrontPage 2003. The format lets you learn by solving problems that you run into. For example, you want find out about Banners, the book not only answers your questions but gives you the background and advise on using the feature. And the author is very candid about suggesting when to use and NOT use a particular feature. The authors obviously have used the product for real-world web sites and really wanted to share their experiences and knowledge."
2,Not too good...,"As an experienced Frontpage user I was looking for lots of info on new Frontpage 2003 features that would show how ""great"" this new release is according to the hype I've heard... Anyway, this book doesn't even acknowledge the existence of Windows Server 2003 and really offers very little (if any) info on the integration of ASP.NET into Frontpage 2003 websites.Basically, I'd say this is for new users - not advanced users. Even for new users - I didn't find it particularly well organized at all. I get the impression it was rushed to print."
2,jasper,"A lot of text that's spread out and difficult to follow. Would have been nice to see more examples. eg, constructing drop down menus section provides a lot of text but few examples to carry you through to actually creating drop down menus. More how to and less theory would be helpful."
3,Not for a Novice,"The book is disjointed. The early section tries to explain FrontPage 2003 contrasting it with earlier versions. Because the changes are here and there, this section is incoherent. Later sections work better but the big picture is missing. Not a book for a beginner learning to use FrontPage. FrontPage on the other hand is relatively intuitive building on menu and file structures learned in Word. It is a powerful, useful, program. The book is throughly written just too many purposes. I would have been better served by a structure that started with here is a web page -- you can do it five ways, here is the quickest..."
1,Reads As If Written By A 12-Year Old,"This is one of the worst books I've ever read. Very difficult for the reader to keep track of the twenty-odd characters in ""The Game."" The characterizations are poor and no reason is given for the reader to care about these people. The plot is so tenuous and obscure that it is an effort to maintain interest. By the time you find out what has been happening and why - you just don't give a d---. This writer knows very little about writing - at least in this genre - and I will not read anything else he writes. Save your time and money. If I could have rated it lower than one star, I would have."
4,Review,"This is a helpful guide to anyone interested in or needing to know about the development of Western music notation. Its a brief book and a vast topic, but the author manages to avoid at least the impression, if not the fact, of superficiality. It is possibly a little naive, or perhaps self-affacing, in that the historical subtexts relating to style and aesthetics (not to mention value-judgement) in and of music as we understand these concepts today in the West are intimately and fundamentally related to the fact that we have a tradition in the West of a music with particularly sophiticated notation. The author does not really explore this issue."
1,What in the world happened to World 2004?,"World 2002 and World 2003 are two of my most favorite CDs. Their songs are modern, lively, and really catchy. World 2004 seems like it's gone to ""payola"", a term that only folks over 50 may understand. What happened? I do see that a different CD label seems to have taken over the ""World 200_"" title, and this CD producer must have decided to get nothing but the cheapest and least-desirable of world music for this CD collection. Even the artists I know and like on this CD seem to have handed over their most forgettable songs. It's definitely not worth the 18 or 19 dollars."
1,Exteremely tasteless & boring,"I usually do not post feedback about music CDs I buy, unless they are really outstanding. This time, however, I will make an exception. The WORLD 2004 compilation is worst hodgepodge of boring, tasteless material I have heard in a very very long time. It is a total waste of money and time. I have no idea what criteria was used to judge and choose the contents of this CD; I suspect the rights to these songs were bought by the pound. It is shocking to see that the worst possible material from very well known artists was used here. The whole contents is nauseating. I now swear I will never ever buy another CD without giving it a spin first; too much rubbish out there.Summary:This is without a doubt (in my opinion) the worst compilation CD of the decade(s).SincerelyPirooz Pakdelgjinc@lycos.com"
5,Redbird delivers,"This is a thoughtful,textured and beautiful album. The harmonies are resonant and the interplay of the musicians is interesting. I absolutely love this recording and it has been at the top of my playlist for the last month."
5,This book is a classic.,"I'm tempted to say this book is indispensible for the student who wants to learn about characteristic classes. But it's sufficient to simply say that I have never seen a better book on the subject. The work is not the latest to be sure, but the exposition and the material covered make this an excellent introductory text as well as a reference."
3,A mixed bag,"Coming from a physics point of view, I did not find this exposition the most useful. It is rather formal and the ordering isn't that natural for a physicist. There is very little effort expended on examples to build intuition.Nevertheless, it may be the only game in town. I haven't looked into what other books are available. I do know that the ones I have seen intended for physicists are pretty thin."
4,suprisingly good album,"there's not a weak track on the whole album. tuneful, peaceful, and romantic."
5,Great New Music!,The album was really great! She has an amazing voice. She wrote the music herself and what can I say more? Absolutely magnificent! Too bad for people who miss out on her music.
5,GREAT CD!,"I was lucky enough to see her while I was on a trip in Norway. I saw her at the Norwegian Music awards and she just stole the show. She does Tromso, Norway proud and I think she has the talent to go everywhere! I can imagine the song ""Unforgivable Sinner"" on radio stations here in the USA! This is a great CD! Tanya"
4,"Very enjoyable, non-bubble gum pop, non-insync artist","While on a scientific research project to Longyearbyen, Spitsbergen, Norway I heard ""Sitting down here"" and ""Playing my game"" at the Huset Pub while drinking a beer. I thought, ""What an interesting sound, kinda poppy, kinda hip. A mixture of the Cranberries and Shawn Colvin."" That's how I'd describe Lene's sound to friends. An enjoyable mix of synthesized and acoustic instrumentation. I wouldn't yet consider her at the same level as a Sarah McLachlan, then again she is only 18 with a few more years to refine her music. If you're looking for entertaining, somewhat cerebral music, this will work. Enjoy!"
5,A breath of fresh air,"Every once in a while a really talented artist comes along and makes a great pop album. One that you can listen to, and dance to. One with great melodies and intriging lyrics. One with a mixture of instruments and some variation in the songs. The last few pop albums I've bought by supposidly ""great artists"" have contained only one or two good tracks and the rest was a waste. This I'm glad to saw is not the case. If there was any justice in the world Lene Marlin would be at least as popular as Britney Spears, but then again in the pop industry today talent is not enough. I'm not looking forward to her next album yet because I'm still enjoying this one so much."
4,a fine young artist,"Lene Marlin's album is lovely. Today, when professional producers assemble new bands and groups on an artificial production line every now and then, groups that do not focus on the music but on their looks and pose, it is very difficult to find such a refreshing young artist, an artist who writes her own lyrics and music, and who is worthy to the title ""artist"" and not ""puppet"".I am not saying that Lene is a top artist or that her music is the biggest jewel in the crown of modern music, but it is definitely absorbable, slightly alternative and melodic. It is worth having in your collection."
3,This cd ain't the best in the world but better than others,"I bought this album coz the booklet and the cover were really well done and coz I liked Unforgivable Sinner, but I expected it to be better. The singles which came out were ok, no doubt, but the other tracks are so boooooring....my God, I put this cd in the player when I need to get a sleep! I don't say the songs are bad, they have a good sound, but there's too slowness, Lene would need faster songs!! My fav track is Playing My Game, in this song she has got a very sweet voice. Anyway, if I had to advise a cd of Lene Marlin I would recommend this, coz the second is worse, and to tell the truth I can't stand it! At least in ""Playing My Game"" there's something to listen to."
4,coming up just short,"I really wanted to love this album. Having just discovered the delightful Shea Seger, and being a big fan of another Scandinavian unknown Lisa Ekdahl, I was hoping to find a new little gem with Lene Marlin.For me, ""Playing My Game"" came up just short. Oh, the single track ""Sitting Down Here"" is awesome, but the rest of the tracks never reach much more than ""also-ran"" status. Lene has a voice similiar to Dido or even Mae Moore. This album is like what Enya would create if she went Pop.The album is worth a listen, pickit up used if you can find it.Go out and buy Shea Seger's ""May Street Project"" and you will forget all about Ms. Marlin."
5,Just when we thought we'd seen most sea creatures,"My kids and I loved this book. Tons of pictures of sea creatures we'd never heard of before i.e. Football fish (appropriately named), Gulper Eel,, Glass sponge, Brittle Star. This interesting book covers everything related to the sea including sea birds.Wonderful pictures & photos"
4,Learning about Sea Creatures,This is a good way to introduce children to the facination of sea creatures. Good for both boys and girls!
3,Mediocre.,"This game was informative as to what paramedics go through on a daily basis. You do learn some aspects on first aid when playing this game. That is what I was expecting while going through this simulation. While playing, there is a time limit for each patient, becuase you have to wrap up before that time limit is up, or the patient is going to die. All in all, it was a mediocre game. I just got this game out of curiosity and thought it may be fun to play paramedic for a little while. If you were thinking about becoming a medic, you just might want this game."
4,Good Game.........Unless you're a medic.,"This game is loaded with the morbid humor most medics are used to hearing. The only thing missing are people in the background screaming and crying for you to do something. Graphics are great! But, if you are a medic you will soon be a little miffed at the little things. Makers should have had 50 or so medics play it before releasing it. The lay person, however, will LOVE it. My husband thinks it is great!"
1,Horribly Stupid game,"dont even imagine getting this game cuz its the worst game ever. After u treat the first patient, it gets extremley boring DON'T GET IT!"
4,Good starter set for learning ancient Greek,"If you are thinking about learning Greek on your own, Reading Ancient Greek (RAG) is a good place to start. Do not allow the acronym RAG to mislead you in purchasing discrimination. The two books A Reasonable Approach (ARA)and The Second Year(TSY) are fairly self-explanatory.The primary problem with TSY is that it refers somewhat regularly to ARA for explanations and definitions.The books as a set are a great resource, but it would be difficult to use TSY without a copy of ARA handy."
1,These things are terrible!,"This is one of the worst products I have ever purchased! I was hesitant to spend almost $20 for what amounts to 12 pieces of plastic, but I thought it might be good insurance for my $300 PDA. It is pretty much impossible to peel them from their backing without getting finger prints on the sticky side. I tried using tweezers and this damages the plastic. Once I got it partially peeled back, they are so sticky, it is almost impossible to get it on straight. Then there were so many air bubbles, I couldn't get a fraction of them out. The plastic was damaged by my efforts. I'm hoping that I didn't hurt the PDA display.There has to be a better alternative!"
1,Dont' bother,"This is a very cheap CD release. No notes, no recording data. Some of the songs are originals, others are remakes, and others have awful overdubs.You can now find the actual recordings on Bear Family's single cd ""For Old Times Sake."" It is well worth the money."
5,Positive Words,"This is a great CD... very helpful and informative and easy to listen to. I recommend it, especially for parents who want to learn how to speak to their children without condemnation or criticism."
1,"urbane but stupendous ignorance, sold as profit","How can I take seriously an ""expert"" who devotes pages 5 and 6 of his book to trying to convince us that the Phoenicians invented talking? Does Mr. Urban really believe what he tells his readers - that, until a mere of thousand years ago when the Phoenicians came along, humankind communicated purely by drawing pictures and letting loose the occasional wordless grunt?It simply did not happen that way - ask any linguist, archeologist, or historianThe author of this work also misleads his readers on the origin of the word ""phonics."" Contrary to his assertion, it doesn't have to do with the word ""Phoenician"" at all. Checking ""phonics"" and ""Phoenician"" in any dictionary which gives word-origins will confirm that.I'd rather fail to communicate at all than communicate false-to-fact information, even for the vast sums that Hal Urban claims he makes from selling his inaccuracies to corporations and the general public."
1,I didnt like it,i have been smoking for 4 years.. i am only 19 years old. this gum did not help me at all and i couldn't even chew it for long BC it would start to burn my throat and taste really gross. im just going to do it cold turkey.
4,Working for me!,"I have been chewing tobacco for 7+ years, and would definitely consider myself ""addicted"". The part about Nicorette gum that worked the best for me was the process of chewing and parking it between your lip and gum. This closely emulates the nicotine delivery of chewing tobacco, thus making my transition much easier.For someone that chewed as often as I have, the dosage was weak in the beginning, but I quickly adjusted to it. Also, I don't chew the gum 9x a day as recommended on the packaging, but rather stick to the times I chewed--3 or 4 times a day. It has been over a week and I'm going strong. This is the longest I have gone without chewing tobacco and I thank Nicorette for that!Give it a shot, you have nothing to lose!"
1,Not a long term solution,"The simple truth is that no magic cure has ever "" made "" any smoker quit smoking nicotine. The key to immediate and lasting abstinence is education and understanding not hypnosis , not acupuncture and not some over-the-counter nicotine product that teaches absolutely nothing while robbing 93%of those who toy with clean-nicotine of a valuable opportunity to master the core principles underlying years of nicotine dependency. Remember, should all else fail, you always have you!source: www.whyquit.com"
4,Essential Music,"A great collection of songs from that infamous label run by Syd Nathan. Beside the scholarly enjoyment you can get out of so many songs in their seminal nature (Train Kept-Rollin, Big Ten-Inch Record, I'm Tore Down, I'll Drown In My Tears, K.C. Loving (aka Kansas City), The Twist, and many many more) the MUSIC is fantastic. Dive in anywhere and enjoy. The only caveat is the booklet is poorly written - - focusing too much on Syd Nathan and giving very incomplete information on the artists themselves - PLUS, there are no songwriting credits! Which is a crime of high order. The only other thing to watch out for is the 4th CD is pretty much tapes of Syd Nathan talking for a half an hour. But otherwise it is a must to own and share."
2,Eureka vacuum,"When I purchased this vacuum, I thought it had a replaceable disposable bag feature. Instead, it had a permanent bag that fills with dust and whatever you vacuumed up. Its a mess to clean the bag. A disposable system is available if you can find one and it costs $40-50 bucks + cost of disposable bags. And, Amazon does not have the replaceable bag system or disposable bags. It may be industrial strength, but over priced."
4,Good bag for big SLRs.,"This bag is great, and has enough storage space for a big-body SLR with a moderate telephoto zoom lens on it. If all youw ant to take out is one lens, maybe another memory card, and a filter or two, this will work fine. Otherwise you want to look into getting accessories that can strap to the sides of this bag...a lens pouch, accessories bag, etc...then you might as well look into a larger bag."
4,Well Built but not well shaped for the camera,"Bag is well built, zippers and closures work well. The shoulder strap is lacking comfort features- neopreme would be a good option. Maybe the manufacturers can assist with providing these as most people would be willing to pay extra instead of buying a bag and then buying a shoulder strap that is actually comfortable. The bag fits the camera with battery grip OK but the bag is not form fitted for the camera. It's a good bag but could use some refinements."
3,Not as expected,"I have purchased this item for my XSI fitted with a battery grip. I had the smaller version from Tamrac and it fitted by XSI (without the grip) perfectly, however, i was disappointed with the newer bag. the size was not a perfect fit, and the overall size was a bit too large for traveling. I think i'll just remove the grip and stick with the old bag."
3,Sloppy for mid sized cameras,"I will start with the build quality which is typical Tamrac, meaning well built. If you have a D200, D2x or another similarly sized camera this may be the bag for you. For me with a D80 (with or without the grip) it is really sloppy and deforms easily when the camera is out making it harder to access the front pockets or accessory bags on the sides (optional). The worse part of this back and the reason I gave it a 3 star review is the carry strap. They designed it with an angle to conform the the shoulder but instead it rides on one edge making it very uncomfortable. my Tamrac 5684 bag was much more comfortable but is too small for my larger lenses and does not support the accessory bag system. I am disapointed and shopping again for a new bag. I will most likely just buy a Lowepro Slingshot 200 to complement my 100 bag."
1,Aveeno,I was very disappointed with this product. I was told by my dermatologist that this product would help to slow facial hair growth. It did absolutely nothing!!!
1,VIZIO is a lot cheaper and a lot better picture,"This is the worst TV I ever own for its price. I had a VIZIO 50 inch plasma which I sold to purchase this 52 inch LCD. Bad mistake. It had a lot sharper picture. This Sharp is a junk. The picture is not clear, the resolution is bad, is like blowing up a low resolution picture on your printer. Do not buy!"
4,Fair purchase,"It is our first flat panel television. I had been debating between LCD and PLASMA, and ended up purchasing this LCD simply because of my size restrictions and its appearance (I had not noticed much of a difference between the LCDs and Plasmas when shopping for the TV). It has a nice design. It has nice brightness and colors, but you need to make sure you will be viewing it from at least 10 feet away. If you are close-up, you will notice that the picture is distorted."
1,A Nightmare! Don't buy from Electronics Expo!,"A Nightmare! Don't buy from Electronics Expo! The 1st Sharp 52' LCD TV was late, had a smashed HDMI & 4 dead pixels. The replacement TV had even more dead pixels & Electronics Expo, Sharp, Amazon & Visa all gave me a horrible time & no respect. So I am stuck with 2 damaged TVs now & still fighting for a refund. My advice to all - Get a SONY from a local store for perfection & no worries!"
3,Where are back up parts,had a problem with the TV set and service man sent a part in to be repaired and came back after two weeks. It was worse than before. They finaly sent a new part fed ex and worked fine. The first month I was without TV! They better fund there parts and service departments.The Picture is Exellent.
5,No Banding issue,"This tv is great. No banding here. This is what I can only believe that people are calling banding:When you get dead space for a split second when you change channels, load a DVD, or change inputs, the screen goes a dark grayish black and there are visible ""bands"" of dark and light. That's it. Whenever a black on the screen is being broadcast to the tv, such as in a dark scene or between a show and a commercial, you get the true color every time. This is a great buy and Amazon has the best deal in town now with the free shipping."
3,"Great picture, missing features, odd display issue","I LOVE HD!!! Haven't seen any 1080p signals yet, but 1080i and 720p both look great. Makes you realize how crappy standard def is.This set is missing some features that I would have expected. Most obvious is PIP. It's really nice to be able to monitor a second channel while you are watching a show. Next is connecting a PC: No VGA connector, max resolution 1280? Seems pretty weak.Last thing: On some standard def signals, the very top of the screen shows some ""crawling ants"" - one or two pixels tall, white, running back and forth. The manual says that's normal. I say that's BS. I occasionally see a steady solid white line on the far left side of the screen, but only on NBC HD shows, so I can't actually attribute that to the TV.Haven't seen any banding on my unit, though!"
5,great TV,I got the TV and monted it on the wall and Brought a HD upconverting DVD player and the picture quality is spectacular. and amazon.com price is very competitive and also the amazon customer service ROCKS..So far it had been almost 2months. working great.
2,Lots of trees but little forest,"This book suffers from dry prose, lack of focus and the inability of the author to leave anything out! It is just a poor read, sad to say....."
2,I can't believe he said that!,"You know how it is when you get a new book, pick it up for the first time, and just open it to read whatever it is that first hits your eyes. When I did just that when I opened to the Monmouth section and read how the author claims Clinton was reluctant to give battle and only did so when circumstances forced him to do so. Gag me. Clinton's own writings state the opposite. Clinton was looking for and hoping for a fight. Not what this author claims.So I was not impressed after reading for the first couple of minutes.Since then I've gone back several times to the book, reading a chapter here and a chapter there. Some interesting tibits, yes, but unimpressive analysis of key events spoil this, at least for me."
5,The New Brand Builder,WINNING BRANDS is a winner in the new Millennium marketplace. Don't build your brand without it!
4,Mini Weeder by Wolf-Garten,"This is a smaller version of my favorite tool over the last 25 years. The hand tool metal handle that's available should hold up well. The older plastic handle I bought in the 80's broke. I still use the 25 year old large weeder--I just needed a new metal handle because I was too tough on it. It broke recently, the toold didn't. While I was shopping, I saw this little one, I had to try it!"
4,extraordinary depth in spirisci connection,extraordinary in-depth spirisci connectedness. it is in the process of becoming a rare reality. We need it now. Lets all wallow in this new miracle of miracles. We are currently in the Eye Of The Miracle - Not the storm !! Congratulations to Ms Holland she is truly a dear person.
1,Lousy product,"Don't order from this guy. If you order a video, he will send you a book instead and then will claim you can't read. has poor customer skills. The book was used and really hard to follow. The book is very expensive $42."
1,Don't waste your money,"Regrettable that you can't rate a book on Amazon with zero stars. If you could this book should be the hands on most deserving zero. Poorly written. No logic. No support for his silly premises and no scientific backup for his primary belief that ancient aliens are a myth. While there remain a sizable number of Fundamentalist religions and Establishment Science sources who have already close-mindedly come to the same conclusion as the author, there is no direct evidence to support their primitive beliefs. The author refuses to deal with the reality of Baalbek, The Great Pyramid, Puma Punku and all of the growing evidence that a sophisticated, scientific and advanced engineering race of alien beings, capable of remarkable achievements, colonized Earth, lived amongst primitive homo erectus and put to practice skill and knowledge that still remains a part of the human memory and archaeological record."
4,""" Well Boys... It's Come"" - Eisenhower","This is a great game with high quality graphics, and sound this is one of the best games of this year. One problem... NO INFANTRY! Otherwise this is a game that should be played over and over again."
3,"nice graphics ,but boring","i really enjoyed this game at the begining ,nice graphics,great weapons,but the backdraw is that there's no infantry ,no naval weapons ,and the terrains almost look the same in all missions ,except for some snow sometimes ,it's nice ,but 2 days you will be bored of it ,and i wonder why the programmers made the US army is the weekest ."
2,Earth 2150 in another wrapper,"Earth 2150 was a fun game that really didn't get the recognition it should have. If you liked Earth 2150, you will like WWW III. Why? IT'S THE SAME GAME! This is nothing but Earth 2150 with new graphics! If you have 2150, don't bother picking this game up. If you don't, 2150 is probably the better of the two games. Either way, why buy this game?"
4,An all too possible reality.,"World War 3: Black Gold combines realistic 3D graphics with inventive scenarios and real military units. You command a force representing one of three countries: the United States, Iraq, and Russia; all of which have unique abilities. The game is made even better by its editor, which allows you to create your own map on which to play. You can even play other WWIII fans via the Internet, though the community is considered by many to be dead. It is my opinion that the lack of infantry is irrelevant, as it would fall easy prey to the more powerful tanks, which are mostly immune (due to their heavy steel plating) to machine gun fire. This is truly one of the best real-time strategy games of its time, and I highly recommend it to all."
4,Sofia,"When all is said and done Sofia will always be number one!! Charm, charisma, sex appeal are a small fraction of what she brings to the screen. Carlo Ponti knew what he was doing!"
5,Great Product,"I bought this to frame my basement and found it to be both very useful and kind of fun. I was a bit nervous about using it at first, but it is pretty simple and I was able to move pretty quickly through my project. It is especially helpful in tight spaces. The construction is great and I will probably use it for a long time to come."
4,Good tool,"Used it a few times so far. Works well except it occasionally gets ""stuck"" and you have to remove the air hose to get it to work. Despite that, it is a real time saver."
3,Not one of David Allan Coe's best performances,"I bought this CD for one song: The Ghost of Hank Williams.Unfortunately, during the song ""The Ghost of Hank Williams"" David Allan Coe sounds tired and it really comes through. I've heard him belt out songs where the feeling reverberates through-out. I've heard him do ""The Ghost of Hank Williams"" where you can feel like you're in the Alabama graveyard. Unfortunately, this version isn't it."
4,Great for the price,"Looks just like in the picture. Assembly was simple, and I agree with others who said it's annoying that the screws don't fit in all the way. Also wobbly when empty, but once you add bottles to it, it sits flat. Good value for the price. Also has a small footprint on my counter which is great. I like it a lot and would definitely consider giving it as a gift."
5,LOVE IT!!!,We bought this for a Christmas present for our daughter and son in law and absolutely adore it! It fits perfectly under their buffet table!
3,Ok,"Had trouble getting some of the screws in, it is a little unstable. But it does work and I've had no problems despite the poor hardware."
4,Wine Rack,Product was easy to assemble. I would recommend it to all of my friends.Product is what I expected it to be.
4,Does what its suppose to!,I works as it should. construction was a bit wobbly...meaning after I put it together the 1 leg would sit firmly on the ground it was a it raised but of course once I piled on the wine it touch the ground just fine. I havent had any problems but beware...only standard size wine bottle will fit (no champange or square bottles)
1,Choose a different product,"Box includes:Front & back assembly, 3 locking rods to connect front/back, 3 screws.Rods don't screw in properly (improper threading) - checkRods tilt at various angles once ""in"" and have to be bent to fit correctly - checkScrews don't fit - checkRack is wobbly due to un-even rod insertion - checkRods are stuck in, making disassembling and returning product impossible - checkI would list some positives about this item, but I've yet to find any."
1,Hard to put together and wobbly,"I recently purchased this item and was very excited when I received it.I started putting it together, the 3 rods did not twist nicely into the grooved area. They barely went in, I had to use a pliers to twist it in... which scratched the black paint off.After finally putting it together as I stood it up, only to find out one corner was a 1 inch higher than the rest!I will never purchase from this company again!"
2,Beautiful piece,"Beautiful piece. The screw do not fit well! Even looks like so easy, I had a hard time to put it together.The bottle on the top part do not fit perfectly as well."
3,6 bottle wine rack,"It says it is a 7 bottle wine rack but only 6 fit! Also, when I put it together it was not stable; it can rock back and forth. Fortunately when the wine is in place it sticks to one lean (either forward or backward) and the bottles remain save.The rack is pretty, its small and fits on the center of my dining room table. Its a good purchase for the price."
2,Fair to middling,"This is an OK wine rack. It didn't look right in my kitchen, though. I'd send it back but the postage is as much as the price of the wine rack. I'll put it in my wine closet downstairs so it will at least be useful."
2,"Not so great, but it works","I thought the assembly required for this wine rack would be no big deal, and its really not. However, the screws don't all fit and it is slightly wobbly. I had no trouble with normal size wine bottles fitting. It does look nice, as long as you don't bump it too much."
2,Returned to seller,"When I assembled the rack, it was lop-sided by about an inch. It's possible that it could have been straightened out with some bending, but since I had decided to return the item, I didn't want to risk breaking the product. Admittedly, I didn't give the seller a chance to correct the mistake; this was supposed to be a Christmas and I was pressed for time. But given my experience, and reading some of the other reviews, this seems to be a common trend. I'd recommend passing on this product and looking elsewhere. I managed to find a similar looking wine rack at Pier1 imports (granted it cost about $10 more)."
4,BRINGING OUT THE BEAST,"Loins of Amon is a superb novel, there is loads of action, war and debauchery of every ilk. A little bit of beastality really brought the book to another level of filth (the good kind). I found the story line profound, quite surprising in a book that has this much rough play. Some of the some of the chapters went a little far into the darkside, you've been warned; but I don't think that should take away from what is over all a fantistic read."
3,I agree with previous comment,"I was at this festival and it was a truly amazing experience. First of all you probably do have to be there to really enjoy the music on this cd. The festival is one in which you travel from stage to stage getting a little taste of each band you see. Some of the performances were by far some of the most memorable experiences ever! The choice of songs on this cd is weak. Dave and friends blew me away, ""trouble"" does not represent the show. Why not put the song ""Thing"" where Dave goes wild and scats. I do love ""One Big HOliday"" from My Morning Jacket. Too much to review, but in summary if you want to experience a little piece of this festival, buy the dvd it is much better and you can see what goes on behind the scenes."
3,"Different Bands, Same Name","I wound up getting this album, mistakenly thinking it was by the 60's pre-punk band known as Monks/ The Monks (who actually wore censured hair and monk robes and were very punk for the 60's...while this The Monks are very not punk for the punk era.)I actually liked this record after a second listen, but for those seeking the ""original"" Monks, this ain't them. For those looking for amusing 70's-90's new wave, this is it."
5,"Man, is God Sexy","I knew what I was getting, it came just in the nick of time, and just as I thought, it was grand!"
2,bette davis saves this movie,"this movie isn't bad, but isn't a materpiece either, fortunately there is the timeless Bette Davis. She saves this movie in my opinion. It's just one of those movies hollywood makes, relaxing to watch once but that you won't bother watch once a month, i'm telling you."
5,Joey Heatherton,This is the second movie Joey Heatherton made. Someone says that she is old beyond her years in this movie. Not true. She is a very under rated movie star. She is a beauty and I welcome anything that's comes out with her in it. I am so happy this is coming to dvd.
2,Only One Reason to See This Movie,"Although I loved Bette Davis and Susan Hayward together in this movie, everything else was a disapointment. Mike Conners and Joey Heatherton were just awful and the movie just did not flow well. Sad because it had all the potential for a really good movie. Only reason to watch is to see 2 great actresses together. What a waste of their talent!"
1,Where Love Has Gone? Down to crapper,"I bought this on VHS, thinking it would at least be campy in parts, but instead it is just plain dull. No fireworks even with Susan Hayward and Bette Davis aboard. The ending is very unsatisfying as is the rest of the film. Do yourself a favor and skip this soap opera junk. If it's 1960s Susan Hayward you want, get Valley of The Dolls. Bette Davis fans would be better off with Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte or Dead Ringer, both from the same era as Where Love Has Gone, but are far better films."
4,Where Love Has Gone,I've watched this movie several times since purchased a few years ago. Susan Hayward is stylish and professional. Will watch again soon.
3,Cautiously awaiting release,Trashy covers from a no-name company. Not even original artwork. I don't hold out much hope for the quality of the actual disc. Will be interested to see what the quality is like when it is released.
3,Where Talent Has Gone,"This is a big expensive turkey. Mike Connors is a second rate leading man and Joey Heatherton simply whines and whinges as the trigger-happy daughter who kills her mother's boyfriend. This turgid melodrama somehow makes boring the real-life story of Lana Turner's daughter shooting her mother's beau, upon which this soap opera is clearly based. Bette is effective in an underwritten role as Susan Hayward's imperious mother - but even she gets monotonous. Susan Hayward, in the lead, at least works hard to carry the film and she's worth watching. She invokes ""I Want to Live"" meets ""Valley of the Dolls"" - entering, exiting, shaking her hair, driving cars fast, screaming, crying, does she slap a face (?), looking into the distance cynically. It's Susan's show."
5,One of the most inventive novels of the past decade,"It is a shame that this book is out of print, because it is one of those books that I would love to recommend to friends to read. The book is many things at once: provocative, sexy, imaginative, fun, sad. The back cover features a blurb comparing him to Pynchon, Nabokov, and DeLillo. Although I don't see the comparison to Nabokov, I would add my own comparisons: J. G. Ballard (especially books like CRASH and VERMILLION SANDS), William S. Burroughs, and even Neal Stephenson. The authors mentioned would prepare a would-be reader for the unexpected and the unusual; it might not prepare the reader for the beauty of his prose.I fully expect this book to be in print again in the near future. Until then, I would urge any fan of literature to search this book out and read it. It is often beautiful, frequently haunting, and always original."
5,Moving and deliciously strange,"Erickson's dark, quirkily romantic future L.A. has the resonance of one of J.G. Ballard's apocalyptic landscapes. Like voyeurs, we're ushered into a world of flickering volcanic fires, leaking hotels and anxiety-run-rampant in the tradition of DeLillo's ""White Noise"" and Pynchon's ""Vineland.""""Amnesiascope"" is far more than a meditation on nightlife. Erickson's meticulously wrought characters are what propels this odd, gorgeous book. At once experimental and character-driven, ""Amnesiacope"" succeeds in its well-honed balance between landscape and psyche, empathy and urban detachment. There wasn't a moment I didn't like; ""Amnesiacope"" stands as one of the most moving near-future novels to have graced the genre."
2,There is a reason this book is out of print.,"I have only been able to read a few chapters. The characters are unlikable. The story, disjointed and reading it was as fun as pulling my own teeth."
2,Not the Greatest Book,"Really just a history of Dr. Lamaze. Interesting, but only really useful if you are planning on using the Lamaze technique exclusively. I took some pointers but ended up being induced, getting an epidural and then an emergency C-Section! So it didn't really come in very handy."
1,not worth a penny,i bought this book thinking it would be a great read and also helpful and it was neither i found errors and thougth it was poorly written!!
5,Insightful,"This book is very easy to read while being an eye opener to the experience of marriage and divorce. The authors used real life stories from young people who have experienced their parents unhappy marriages, their divorces and the outcomes. These insightful stories helped explain the concepts that the authors described. This was such a good read that I didn't want to put it down. A must read for anyone in a relationship."
5,Divorce Lessons is an understatement,"This book was like a real life novel made up of so much drama that keeps you hooked. The real life accounts of student's experiences first hand of divorce are eye awakening. This book will guide you and help you understand what is going on and what you can expect to happen through a divorce. The real life vignettes illustrate the concepts given which help you from getting bored. This book is very comprehensive and covers everything you need to know about divorce by presenting a topic, giving examples and analyzing the examples and then gives recommendations in the end as a way of prevention or coping. This book is recommended for any one who is exposed first or second hand to divorce and can act like a real guide in navigating the way to understanding of what is happening, the reasons why and what could happen."
1,A Great Disapointment,There is too much Australian Philharmonic and too little Tommy Emmanuel. The recording sounds like the microphone was hidden in someone's pocket. It has little dynamic range and the sounds are muffled. I have a track of Tommy playing Classical Gas which I recorded off of FM radio which is far superior in performance and sound than the track on this album.
4,Too young Tommy,"This disc is from the era when orchestration was used instead of just listening to acoustic guitar music. (Remember Mason Williams' classical gas with the orchestration? Same here.) For true Tommy Emmanuel fans, I would not buy this CD. The CD itself arrived in perfect condition, however, and arrived quickly after ordering. So the product was great, the contents disappoint."
1,Seriously Overpriced And Poorly Presented,"I was in for a major letdown when I received this...I expected a lot more than (a) a skimpy thin paperback book and (b) a random collection of jottings that are not presented in a clear, readable fashion. This is nothing more than a glorified post-it-note calendar book turned into a thin softcover with skimpy details and then given an outrageously high price. If you're used to the kind of detailed study like in Lyle Spatz's book about the history of Yankee trades, you won't find anything to like here."
4,Come on.,"That one review about breaking the CD that's pretty dumb. Now, for some of the other people that are talking about the tenor solos, I would like to see you people sing this extremely high line. Beside I have read through my reviews that Orff had written #12 Olim lacus colueram high should a high range not because it sound pretty but because he found the tenor voice when reaching for notes quite appealing there. Plus the song is about being a swan, swan don't make the most beautiful sounds. So there. Sorry but I had to defend the singers because people don't understand all of the studying and practice behind it.Other wise this CD has a lot of good foot tapping and emotional moments like any other good piece of well performed music. The soprano soloist is fabulous. She is someone that makes you drop your jaw. I believe that the rest of the soloist pull their weight in this rendition of a classic."
4,I can dig this.......,"I have 3 words to say...I LIKE IT. This is a great album with strong songs to boot. Lotus Eaters, Day For Night, Where is the... are all my favorites. I think it is not a strong as Esthero, Lamb, Snooze or even Homogenic (bjork) but I would totally recomend it to a friend."
1,Moloko: My Tight Sweater - Don't Buy It!!,"I heard Moloko newest dance version of ""Sing It Back"" on the radio the other day (1/06) and HAD to have more. So I hit Amazon, read these reviews and bingo - I dropped $45 bucks for two of her CDs (this being one), both imports. Got them today and was INCREDIBLY disappointed. Yes, they are quirky, curious and fun in their own way, but NOTHING like her newest single - nada, zilch, zip. Very experimental, which I applaud, but a bit too experimental if you ask me, and of course I was expecting something way different from the reviews. In all honesty, between the two discs (32 songs total!), I MAYBE like ONE, and it is NOT the original ""Sing It Back"". SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy them USED if at all. Really...trust me."
5,eenie meanie miny Moloko!,"Well, first of all, when it comes to Moloko, you need not classify, but simply assign yourself to a special corner of your home and make sure your shoes are of comfort because your feet will disclose from your body and it'll be all a blur in the morning but I assure you, it will not hurt, on the contrary, it will do you unbelievable good. Then, you can go back to organizing whatever it was you wanted to categorize."
5,If you love weird music...,"I don't think I've ever managed to keep interest in one single artist for so long. I bought this CD when it came out... and almost 8 years later I continue to enjoy it. If you love weird quarky music, then you'll love this. Moloko made her impression with this CD. It is a MUST HAVE for any Moloko Fan."
4,Very Entertaining,"Not every cut on this CD is great, but there are enough to garnish 4 out of 5 stars. It manages to be groovy and humorous at the same time."
3,Moloko is Pure Wack!,"The concept of this album is 'cartoons', as the tracks play like cartoon skits. Some of them are brilliant, while some just fail at being proper. These seem like 'filler material'.While it has a cartoon concept, it uses cheesy synths to make 'Killer Grooves'. It contributes to the irritation factor of the record. It is like a horrible album, with some surprises in it!I am not saying this band is bad, in fact I will say they are innovative in a way. Try listening to 'I am not a doctor'. The songs and lyrics are more organic, with only a small percenatge of irritabilty, as compared to this one.If you are looking for a good 'Well Done' record, look elsewhere. Moloko is only recommended for those who want to hear other ways of making music."
5,yummy!,"i've loved cajun trail mix for quite awhile now. i've ordered twice from amazon and both had basically the same ingredients, but the one i got today (yep, on a sunday from FedEx! better than UPS!) from Olivenation has what appear to be pumpkin seeds and funny little peanutty things which i can't identify, but which are really crispy and good. not so hot as to freak out the weak-spirited, but i'd like hotter. it's still good and it comes in a resealable, foil package! very cool and yummy stuff!"
1,Virtually worthless!!,"I wish I would have checked out reviews before I purchased it! Like others, it will just lock up. It has done this since day one. I have to go through all my cords and unplug it. Also, cds have skipped horribly since day one. Lastly, I can't always find radio stations. If I go backwards on the dial, I can eventually find them; otherwise, it's just static. Complete waste of money!!"
1,Returned 4 of them!!!,"Got this unit for my parents for Christmas. Well, after 4 returns, we asked the store to replace it with a different brand/model. It was ridiculous! The units wouldn't read the CD's. Would list READ for about 30 seconds, then skip to another disc, list READ again, and so on thru all 5. Then it would say ""no disc"". Will be complaining to RCA at this point, but not sure how far I'll get. DO NOT purchase this item."
1,plug unplug plug unplug,"Same problem mentioned in other reviews. The machine just stops working, sometimes in the middle of play, other times when on standby, it will not respond. What happens is the time lights are on, but ""nobody is home"". No controls onboard or on remote cause any response. The only thing that works to allow use is to unplug and plug - several times per day. And, some CDs cannot be read by the machine, and most recently slot#s are confused. GRRRRR. I do not recommend this machine, and we are looking at replacing ours. Will report back on customer service."
3,Same freezing problem here,"I bought this unit for my wife to go with the RCA RDW900 wireless music transmitter. The RD900W needs an audio input and our old stereo didn't have one, and I needed an inexpensive stereo for a christmas gift.The stereo does freeze up, and it bugs the heck out of us, but we live with it for now because the price was right. We will buy a real stereo system some day. For now, my wife can hear her computer music out of the stereo"
2,so many problems...,"Don't have any problems not mentioned in other reviews, but those are more than enough. System freezes up, cd player is spotty and though it has a ""simultaneous play and load system,"" if you do manage to get a cd to play but then try to load another in the tray, you should expect problems. it does sound ok. As a radio, it works, but it takes up a large footprint to merely be an ok radio."
5,"Commentary on ""The Peeper"" episode","The fourth season included the first appearance of Tom Poston as the Peeper. In the episode Emily is not enthusiastic about the character played by Tom Poston. The commentary was made after Tom Poston and Suzanne Pleshette were married in 2000. The commenrtary reveals Bob, Suzanne, and Tom commenting on the episode aired 25-30 years previously."
3,Good Neighbours,"The deadpan comedy of Bob Newhart is [as always] tremendous. Susan Pleshette is a great foil as are his many ""clients"". However, didn't any of the producers realize that after a few episodes the annoying and intrusive neighbour Howard became a huge negative to the show?"
5,Bob Newhart-The Complete Fourth Season,"I loved this Bob Newhart comedy show when it originally came out and the reruns of the show. It's so nice to be able to have the shows on DVD to watch at any time and I look forward to the next ""Season Five""! The price of the product was great and the shows are just the best!!!"
5,Hi Bob!,"This season, the show really hit its stride, and the writing and acting take more risks.The reward is yours.Maybe it's just me, but there are some bits in this season which I could not stop laughing at. The way the cast interacts also shows that they've completely adapted to Newhart's style of humor, and that they really, really like working together.Pure pleasure!"
5,And what about the closet...?,"Another entertaining season with Bob. Even a boring Newhart episode aces any crappy show aired on Fox. So, don't refrain from purchasing. But the real mystery to me is Bob's closet. Yeah, I know the romance between Howard and Ellen drags a bit (How anyone could become erotically attached to Howard is beyond me.), but that's the way it goes. The question of the closet, however, is: Where does Bob put all those goofy clothes. Yep, every episode he sports a new, garish outfit. Yet, his closet is always half empty. Does Bob maintain some kind of Harry Potter expanding closet device or does some clothing company dress him on the elevator on the way up to his office each day? Perhaps some companies that sell clothing to folks who believe they are financially successful would do that for credits at the end of the show. Anyhow, Bob's costumes are almost half the fun."
3,It has the Moo Goo Gai Pan,"I thought the earlier seasons were better, although it picks up through out season 4, but it is a must for the Moo Goo Gai Pan episode (Over the River and Through the Woods). Let's face it, drug humor can be very funny."
4,Who is Mr. X,The DVD is great for media training. The scene of Bob Newhart being ambushed on live T.V. still makes me laugh out loud. Mr. Newhart is comedic genius.
2,Not bad... just not that good either,"I've watched this movie twice (I'm that big of a fan of Cash), and the Last Days is still only marginal. The acting is not convincing, though it is endearing, nor is the story very compelling. The movie seems to justify two men whose actions were quite ignoble, no matter how one views the outcome of the Civil War."
2,last days of frank and jesse james.,"very poor acting from johnny cash / the film itself is not to bad/ a very average western . kris is in good acting form and a comeo by willie nelson near the end is good , but johnny was mis- cast and would be the biggest downfall to the film."
4,the legend never dies,"Footnotes from the lives and legends of Frank and Jesse James that are often left out of other James movies are featured in this one. It's a charming TV movie that seems to be as close to the truth as legends can ever be. In other words, it takes a slightly more realistic approach to the legend, but still comes across like a whopping yarn your Southern grampa would tell you. I liked that. Don't expect too much action, but get ready to be charmed. Have a beer, settle back, and enjoy."
4,good TV movie,This TV movie is more about the personal lives of Frank and Jesse James so don't expect too many shoot outs. This is a very interesting look into the lives of the characters and that's what I like about this type of Western movie. Kris and Johnny are both very good in their roles. I can't believe June played their mother!
4,very good,"The Ballad of Jesse James was one of the most popular songs of the 19th century. Johnny Cash once noted that fact saying that his songs of violence and crime came from that same American traditon. Frank and Jesse James were ""America's Robin Hoods"" and Cash and Kristofferson have wonderful chemistry as the outlaw brothers in The Last Days of Frank and Jesse James. If you don't like 80's TV movies, or if you could care less about Frank and Jesse James, this may not be for you. Otherwise, this is one of the most accurate films about the James brothers ever made. There's a little fancy and folklore thrown into the mix, but James devotees wanting a realistic depiction should be very pleased with this movie."
2,Not Enough Kabbalah,"I must admit, the introduction to Kundalini and Kabbalah are, in this book, spectacular. Kundalini is a subject that is taught well in this book, however, there is only one Kabbalist ritual in the whole book. I do not recommend buying this book, especially as an ""end all"" guide."
1,Thumbs down,"Not a good book. This guy has some strange ideas about what Kabbalah is. Although he's clearly Jewish, he seems to be strongly influenced by some form of Christian tradition. Either way, it made me feel a bit sick because of the way he was writing and I had to put the book down after a couple of chapters. Great title though - that made me buy it, and I'm glad I did to at least see what it was about. I'll get back to reading the rest of it at some point.."
5,"the best, period.",Teri Moise has so much talent! it's too bad that most americans haven't heard of her! Je serai la: that's the song!!!
1,I bought this book by mistake.,"This book is very funny. For all the wrong reasons. One sentence: ""To look at the homosexual and say he or she is unnatural is like looking at an unconventionally clipped poodle or even an unclipped poodle and seeing that as unnatural."" Uh-huh. Required reading for anyone into uncut poodles."
1,Waste of money,"With every conceivable test of different print seetings I tried, even Kodak's ""recommended"" settings, this paper came out terribly, especially in photgraphs that had a lot of black. The black ink clumps, leaving a lot of crackly marks. Don't waste your money."
4,Confronting!,"We Dutch people are pretty far in excepting other people's religion, colour, tradtions, etc. etc. So, it really struck me that the black vs. white issue is still so vived in the US! Wanne see what I mean?! Watch it!!!"
2,Great idea... in theory,"The idea behind the show was fascinating. But it lost something in the actual execution. The adults in both families seem determined to prove their racial counterparts wrong, rather than learn from each other. Don't get me wrong; the white parents would inspire this reaction in anyone, especially the father. But everyone involved (except the children) are only interested in claiming the honor of being right. The fact that they don't maintain their public disguises for the duration of the series doesn't help matters.As for the DVDs, I was hoping the commentary from the cast members would shed some light on the episodes. I've only seen the ladies' commentary so far, and I didn't hear any discussion on the arguments that took place, in particular the exchange over the use of the word ""bitch"". The show and the DVD extras proved to be disappointing all around."
3,It looks great but the kindle edition is black & white,"i found this book in the kindle edition but when i downloaded it, it was black & white, total disappointment because it is a fantastic book, can anyone look into changing the kindle edition into color please, that would be fantastic! Thank You!If it was in color I would definitely give it 5 stars."
4,helpful material,"this is helpful. And if you do somthings before listening CD(eg) say a prayer or deep breathing, ask help to your higher self or archeangels, or ascended masters)the better outcome you will see. When the first time I listened to this CD, I resolved one of my family issue. And sometimes my attitude was changed without conscious effort. Shortly, before listening, need to do something for the better result."
4,Amazing what can be done!,"The directions are straight forward and simple for the quilts in this book. Gives you some tips on different types of fabric and how to handle neck ties before putting them into a quilt. The quilts are so beautiful, I could not believe that they came from ugly neck ties!"
5,one in the holy trinity of male soul singers,"sam cooke, ray charles and little willie john make up in my opinion the holy trinity of the great male soul singers [all the other great and gifted soulsters are merely congregation] indeed these three more than all the others shaped what soul at its best could be and would become. but the unfortunate truth is that even more than sam cooke - little willie john may be the most underrated soul-blues singer of all time. listen to his 'sufferin' with the blues' or his 'my love is' or 'fever' [his fever is far superior to all brand x remakes] and if you aren't moved in some way then quite possibly you're pulseless. the strong timbre, musical use of his gritty falsetto, his control on difficult phrases' the power and convition of his interpetations can easily leave one breathless and effected in sad and wonderful ways. an absolute must for any true soul-blues collection. ---- bernard tanner,jr."
4,"Ahhhh. Billy Blanks, hmm......",Tsk tsk.I lost 5lbs in about a week or two because of you. haha.Love this video. Liked the bootcamp elite and ampd better though. But this is damn good. Burns about 400-700 in 40-60mins workout. Craazzay.
4,Love it!,"I love Billy Banks and this DVD is great. It's high gear, really makes you move and sweat! You can do it with or without Billy bands and still get a fantastic cardio workout. I liked this Way better than the Turbo Jam set. The drawbacks I found were Billy's counting was off - but I find that in all of his Dvd's! And I didn't like how Shelly feels she has to scream at the end of every exercise!"
3,This is an okay workout.,"After doing the Total Body Fat Blaster dvd, this one just doesn't do it for me. The counting is off and you do more reps on one side with a lot of the exercises. The tempo is slower and you do a lot of marching. I don't feel you do each exersice long enough. I would recommend getting the Total Body Fat Blaster dvd if you want a challenge and you're a beginner (and it will be a challenge at first) or on an intermediate level. Don't worry about the Billy Bands if you're a beginner or just use ankle and wrist weights. Good luck!"
3,fast paced good workout,"The delivery of my product was fast. For the inexpensive price I paid for this dvd, the workout is good. Its a bit fast for a beginner, so I don't recommend it for beginners to Tai Bo. But overall fun and energetic."
2,Fat BLASTING??...not so much,"I have to say, I've been a fan of the Tae Bo routine for years, but I think the latest edition of the ""Billy Bands"" has been the biggest downside of the new workouts. I find myself just feeling awkward and discomforted when doing the moves, especially when doing the kicks. They just sort of jiggle around like bungi coards rather than providing any intense resistence.I agree with those who say this workout isn't nearly as heart-pumping as it claims to be (you actually just end up being persuaded into thinking you've done an intense workout, when you're really doing a lot of walking in place and very slow moves that feel like a waste of time).Yes, it will make you sweat, and it will get your heart-rate up evetually, but Tae Bo veterans will be extremely bored and unsatisfied with it. For some serious calorie crunching, I'd reccommend the Tae Bo Get Ripped series."
3,INTERESTING EARLY MASCAGNI,"FROM THE INFORMATIVE LINER NOTES, WE FIND OUT THAT THIS CANTATA, WRITTEN WHEN MASCAGNI WAS ONLY 17, WAS LATER RECYCLED BY HIM INTO THE 1932 ""PINETTA"". HOWEVER, IT IS QUITE ASTONISHING TO HEAR IN THE YOUTHFUL WORK THE BEAUTIFUL, CAREFUL ORCHESTRATION OF THE COMPOSER'S LATER WORKS. IN REALITY, IT SHOULD BE CALLED A CONCERT OPERA.THIS LIVE RECORDING DATES FROM 2003, SO THE SOUND IS VERY GOOD. UNFORTUNATELY, THE SINGING LEAVES A BIT TO BE DESIRED, PARTICULARLY THE SOPRANO, ROSELLA REDIOGLIA, WHO MADE SOUNDS QUITE PAINFUL TO MY EARS. ANTONIO DI PALMA HAS A STENTOREAN, UNSBUTLE TENOR VOICE HE USES IN WHAT HE THINKS IS VERISMO STYLE. MASSIMILIANO FISCHERA IS A CAPABLE BARITONE.BUT THE MUSIC ITSELF SAVES THE RECORDING. IT SHOWS HOW INDEED THE CHILD IS THE FATHER OF THE MAN. I GIVE THE SINGING 3 STARS AND THE MUSIC 4 STARS."
4,Not a fan club exclusive at all but still a nice doll,"I have no idea why the other reviewer who should know better, thinks this doll is a BFC exclusive. she was a regular retail item and recently was available at Tuesday Morning at close out prices. She is a very nice silk-stone doll, But I do not like her hair, which resembles a haystack, or the rather boring taupe of her dress and I am sure ROBERT BEST WAS RAISED WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW YOU DO NOT WEAR OPERA LENGTH GLOVES IN THE DAY TIME. I am also put off by the fact they packaged her underwear and called this a gift set. but she is a great doll if you tweak her hairdo a bit. I think my particular doll just doesn't have quite as nice hair as somw of the other ones of these I have seen"
5,Easy to install and works great,"The card was easy to install and it works great. Also, J&R Music and computer World is great to work with. No problems at all."
4,Great Product,"I just purchased this product and installed it on my PowerBook running Panther. While the bundled drivers were a bit buggy (volume control didn't work, etc.). I dind't have any kernal panics, however after looking through M-Audio's webisite a bit, I found an updated driver for Panther which is now working perfectly. The sound quality is great (although turning on the virtual surround mode decreases quality) and the product configuration options and features are as good as you'll find in any external card at this price."
1,Do Not Buy If You Own A Mac,"The M-Audio Revolution 7.1 is listed as being Mac compatible but with all the issues it has currently, I am not sure how that is true.I own a G4 Mirrored Drive Tower and have had nothing but problems with this sound card. Currently there is still no driver for anything past 10.4.6 and if you upgrade any higher the card will not work in Surround Sound. Besides that there is constant speaker popping and horrible buzzing and squeals when switching between programs, sometimes even when the computer is not in use. It has been flakey with surround sound when using DVD Player and Quicktime, as well. During the 10% of times it works without a hassle the sound is great through my Logitech speakers, so it is quite sad when it doesn't work. It seems that this is the only option for Mac users to achieve surround sound that I know of, which is also very saddening.I have a feeling I will be selling this to a PC user in the near future and just settling for good ol'stereo."
4,good fundamentals,"This book, although long-winded and expensive, seems to get the point across that Singapore and Malaysia both have a very strong presence in the electronics industry. It described for me how the governments draws in potential corporations and attempts to keep them there. I'm looking forward to reading about the other countries in the series."
1,The Singapore Malaysia Industries....,"This book discusses none of the tenets that it set out to. There is no discussion on the local firm interest in technology, and it seems as though Mr. Beane and company stopped doing research in the mid 70s. An awful book that set out to do too much and completed nothing."
1,Embarrasing Literature,This miserable excuse for literature not only provides basic racist dogma but also severely jeopardizes the people who it attempts to serve. I was not only disgusted by this awful and horrific piece of literature but felt truly offended and disgusted to be a human being. After reading this text I question whether Donald Beane's life has any purpose. I hope that the next time he attempts to write a piece of literature he learns the basic tennets of research and common sense.
1,Singapore and Malaysia Industries,I was truly dissappointed by this pathethic excuse for a political analysis. Donald Beane's text lacks any kind of focus or interest as he takes his reader on the analytical journey of these two important Southeast Asian economies. Overall I was truly angered and outraged at his assumptions and overall lack of vision in a region that spawned off the powerful Asian Crisis. Donald Beane needs to stop lumbering in pointless detail and needs to start understanding the concept of an argument.
5,Super book,A must purchase for anyone who is interested in the field. I am a mathematician with only casual interest in linguistics. But I found it a super introduction to many questions I am interested in studying. A must purchase.
3,Accessories,"I have a couple of questions, first of all are there any other accessories such as battery pack, charger, storage case? What about serial and parallel ports? What about compatability with scanners, printers, gaming software, shipping charges? etc. There were no comments on these items. Can you provide any information?"
4,Does the Job,Purchased to ease the effect of CPAP machine straps on my forehed when I sleep. The skull cap accomplished this purpose.
5,A Classic Little Gem,"This book changed the way I see the world, literally. I read it when I was a teen and I bought it again on Amazon to replace the copy I had lost long ago. It's every bit as surprising as I remembered. The author will tell you facts about odds and probability which will make you scratch your head and say, ""I'll be darned"", and sometimes slap your forehead and go, ""of course!"" Darrell Huff knows his subject, and Irving Geis' illustrations make everything clear in an amusing fashion. Readers who are interested in science, media, and politics will find the material relevant to today's topics, as well. Add this one to your bookshelf."
2,Leaks and broke on first try,"I really wanted to give this a glowing review, but I can't.I bought 2 of these and they both leak.Then, when I was trying to adjust one of them, the fittings broke.So now I have a leaky magnet. (paperweight, perhaps?)I gotta say I'm pretty disappointed.Dan"
5,love this,"I love the Wolf-Garten products, especially these interchangeable attachments. I already had several and decided to add to my collection this year to make my gardening easier. Not disappointed."
5,Very good read. Keeps you engaged,One of the most in depth reads of Robert E. Lee. Very well done. Great background on his early years.
4,"on the whole, a fair portrayal","Professor Thomas's portray was excellent, & very fair. I did not select the book for an intensive portray of his Civil War military activites. I wanted to gain insight of the inner man, which the book provided. I enjoyed especially the glimpses of him as father (watching over his injured young son, his writing to a daugher of her illegible letter) and his views of child rearing & education. The only part I had problems with was his portray of Longstreet. It seems that authors either favor Lee & completely discredit Longstreet, or vice versa. I would have liked to understood why he chose to walk away from his US Army responsibility to uphold the Union & the Constitution, but that comes from living in the modern era."
4,the whole man,"thomas does an extraordinary job of descibing the whole man in this book. It in no way glamourizes Lee as a man. It tells much about his shortcomings as a husband and father and friend. Robert E lee was not larger than life and Thomas makes that clear. In relation to relating Lee's shortcomings;however,Thomas often mentions Lee's zeal for women other than his wife but never makes it known if these liasions with other women were platonic or otherwise adulturous. All in all it is a detailed and informative work."
3,Robert E. Lee,"In the book it has the thing the he enjoyed doing as a child. It tells you his hobbies and thyings about his life. He was born Jan.19,1807 in Westmoreland county,Va. He died Oct.12,1870.There were nine major events in the book and they were all diffrent battles."
5,This is a very detailed and researched book.,I had the pleasure of have Thomas as my professor at the University of Georgia and I believe he has written a very good book about a great man.
3,Lee the Man and Warrior,"This book is a biography of Lee the man, not an examination of one of our history's most notable generals.The military side of Lee is, of course, a major part of Thomas's story. However, he has attempted to paint a charactor study of Robert E. Lee so that his deportment and decisions during the Civil War can be seen to flow from a man molded by tradition, duty, honor and the uniquely historic family from which he came.This means that the book spends much time on Lee's pre Civil War life as well as time delving into his relationships with his family and others. The result is a readible book that gives the reader an entre into the man Robert E. Lee. Those looking for a military expose or exploration may be somewhat disappointed, but this is still a worthwhile book."
2,Save Your Money!,"Though the book in it's entirity is filled with supposition, assumption, presumption, and speculation, the first two-thirds of the book are fairly entertaining. Mr. Thomas tries his hand as a psychic, military tactician, and psychoanalyst; he fails miserably on all counts. He also manages to omit several key incidents in Lee's life which point much more directly to the man's real character and values. While the last third of the book is boring and tedious, Mr. Thomas doesn't miss the opportunity to do a little politically-correct Southern bashing to assure good reviews from the New York Times, et al. In the end, Thomas tries to leave everyone with a comfy-warm feeling which really only serves to undermine much of his own thesis. By the way, nearly ALL white people in the US in the 1800's, whether North or South, abolitionist or slave-owner, educated or ignorant, rich or poor ""believed"" the white race to be superior...even Lincoln. You'd think a professor would know that."
4,AWESOME LIVE BAND!,"You have to see !!! live to truly understand what they're getting at with their albums. Granted, most bands CDs are enriched by a good touring reputation, but !!! inspired one of the most dance-crazy audiences I've ever seen at any show ever. They're also excellent musicians with a killer rhythm section and a gregarious, witty frontman. ""Pardon My Freedom"" is a good song on this record, but live--something else entirely.And they are too funky! Loosen up, uptight one-star-review guy. This music is supposed to be for fun."
5,dancepunkfunkindiepoprockdiscoelectronica,"""Louden Up Now"" is composed of an amazing mixture of various genres (see title.) Although such a conglomerate may appear preposterous, !!! manages to pull it off, and they do so with exceptional results. I haven't experienced an album that has made me want to dance this much since the faint's ""danse macabre"". Personally, I would highly recommend this album to anyone. My favorites are ""Hello? Is This On?"" ""Me and Giuliani Down by the Schoolyard"" and ""Pardon My Freedom"""
3,Fleeting grooves,"3 1/2Heated punk-funk is a bit rough around the edges at times, but works best in quick bursts of repetitious flow, something !!! keenly expand upon more than most."
4,"""Does anyone here speak English""","wow what a fun little dancy cd, this band reminds me of the dancy version of mindless self indulgence, there really fun to listen and dance to. If you like dance music pick this one up and check out tracks ""whent the going get tough, the tough get Karazee!"" ""pardon my freedom"" and ""Hello? Is This Thing On?"" are hte highlights from the cd in my view"
4,Finally: the album,"I saw these guys in NYC in October 2002. It was an exciting show. Almost two years later finally they have put out an album. Like Radio 4, !!! have to be seen and heard. This record fulfills the promise. It's okay to do drugs too."
3,Fun,"!!! may well be the trendiest band on the planet. Riding a cooler-than-thou semi-New York punk-funk wave, they make The Rapture look like Shed Seven. It's all thrillingly dancable, and was condensed into last year's benchmark 9-minute single 'Me And Giuliani Down By The Schoolyard (A True Story)'. Now they return with their debut full-length, which makes full use of production techniques and hipster cool to create a unique party record. Funky bass, stabbing keyboards and angular guitars make an excellent mix, brought to the fore on tracks like 'Hello Is This Thing On' and the disco-ish funk-pop of 'Pardon My Freedom'. Nothing quite matches the single, but it's fun stuff."
3,Pretty cool and evocative of 80s dance punk,"I don't have a lot to say about this band or this record as I am just beginning to familiarize myself with them, but listening to it, I can say that I think they're cool. They evoke, and remind me of, the period in music in the early 80s when post-punk merged with dance music, and we got such acts, some being one hit wonders, as: Konk, ESG, the Bush Tetras, Medium Medium, Liquid Liquid, A Certain Ratio, Maximum Joy. Essentially, they offer a groove music that evokes St. Marks Place, Soho and Tompkins Square Park, circa 1984, as well as of a small, legendary Greenwich Village record shop/label - 99 Records (at 99 Macdougal Street) - which specialized in post-punk groove music. I also dig the title to the song Me and Giuliani Down by the School Yard (A True Story), not to mention the radical, anti-fascist message the song contains."
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"The music in this long-awaited indie-release is monotonous, dull, and unoriginal. On top of all this, the lyrics are inane kinda like the speeches of Dubya Bush. Don't waste your money on this stuff. The repetitive drum beats will only give you a headache. The bass and guitar work are mediocre at best and lack any sort of creativity. Chk Chk Chk is a prime example of style dominating substance."
1,"OH, THE HORROR","This is one of the most dismal, horrid, abysmal pieces of sh*t ever created. The vocals suck miserably, the music sucks and doesn't make up for the lack of vocal talent, and it is a (dance?) album pretending to be political... WHY? If I want to dance, I'll listen to the Rapture or the Faint, and if I want politics, I'll pick up a Radiohead album. I can't believe that record companies allow such rubbish to be released... shame on you, music industry, for you have further proven that you only support talentless a**holes. Along with Fiery Furnace's Blueberry Boat, this is the biggest waste of money, time, CDs, etc. E V E R."
1,Code Boring!,I found this game to be very boring. You didn't really have any control over the game play. It was just too robotic for me.
4,Could be better,I thought this game would be better. Although game play is slow (very slow) the graphics aren't that bad but could be a lot better. Wouldn't buy this for someone else. Thought the interface was hard to get used to--The PDA is very annoying to use. Thought the best thing was trying to kill the people I was supposed to be saving.Good luck to you doctors.
4,wolf-garten hand trowel,"This is sturdy well balanced tool for digging in garden plots or flower beds. The metal is strong enough to take the force of digging into hard ground without bending or buckling. The only drawback is that the point of the trowel is a bit too blunt, Otherwise it is a good tool."
3,Heart of the Dove,The book was good but the auther finished up in to short of a time.Could have given a little more imformatin on the villon.
2,slow,This just seemed like a story going no where fast. I tried several times to continue reading but could never get into it.
3,OK product,"Works good, a little on the flimsy side. Still burns the grass. Lid gets to hot to take off without a insulated mitt."
3,item was damaged when delivered,"The item appears to work well. i have not had a chance to use it yet since it has been so hot where i live, the only issue i had was that the bottom bowl and lid were both dented pretty bad at some point before I recieved it."
3,Not suitable for soft woods like pine.,"I bought this knowing I wanted to use it with soft woods but when I got it the directions said it was not for soft wood, and the holes in the screen are too big. It is a nice looking firepit and I wanted the portability so I took it to a machine shop and they tacked on metal screen wire all the way around the screen. That works fine but the original screen is aluminum, I think, and very soft and easily bendable. The whole thing just kind of sits together instead of being held together. Also, I found the directions for the original screen hard to follow and I'm not sure yet that I have it together right. It is together, though, and I've had a nice fire. There were two big washers that weren't mentioned in the directions so I don't know what they are for."
4,Review of Landmann 28-Inch Heatwave Deluxe fireplace,Bought this product for a birthday present to replace an older outside fireplace in a similar style by Weber. The assembly of it went without any difficulty and fairly quickly with 2 people putting it together. Had a fire in the fireplace the first evening and saw that the bottom grate was already starting to warp from the heat (which was no surprise). The only improvement that could be made to this model is if there was a door in the screening so that you could add wood without having to take the top off. Having a door would also make it easier to move the wood around inside of it once there is a good fire going (wouldn't have to reach down into the flames). Overall the person who recieved the present is very happy with is fireplace so I would recommend it to others.Landmann 28008 28-Inch Heatwave Deluxe Fireplace
1,Poor condition... Slow Customer service,"I bought the Heatwave as an early Fathers Day gift. I was embarrassed when my father opened the gift and it was dented, scratched and had rust to some degree on every single piece. The package arrived in decent shape so that lead me to believe that the fireplace took all that damage before it shipped and must have also been given a salt bath to give it that nice rusty patina. I tried calling customer service and contacting them online... a response was not given until nearly 3 weeks later and was not helpful.My purchase of the Landmann Heatwave is probably the worst shopping experience I've ever had online and off. Between Landmann's poor quality assurance and customer support I will not be purchasing one of their products again."
1,broke,The wheel was broke and I called for a replacement but never got a call back....Very poor service.
2,Poorly made.,I saw one of these fireplaces at Menards last summer and was amazed how thin the metal was. Go with the weber. Much better materials.
4,Very Nice Fire Pit,"Pros: (Reason for +4 star)-Sits high, so warmth is felt sitting next to it. I find low pits warm the feet well, but not the rest of the body. This style allows you to warm your feet under the pit, and the lid directs the heat nicely from the sides, which efficiently limits loss of heat from the top.-Sturdy. Once put together the pieces fit well and feel snug. I have owned other pits where the lid or the spark screen never felt like they sat right.Con: (Reason for -1 star)-I have owned for about 3mo and had 8-10 fires. The paint or the silver finish on the spark screen has started to flake in some small places.Tips:-Follow the instructions regarding sand on the bottom of the saucer, it will equate to a longer life for your new pit.-Get a Cover if left outside. No pit is immune to rust if they have to endure the elements 24/7. Canvas works great to protect."
4,slight damage in shipping but happy!,"This product is worth the money I paid, the only problem was that when I opened the box the edge of the fire pit and lid, looked like they had been dropped and bent slightly. This does not effect the working of the pit, just chipped the paint a little. The box did not seam to be damaged so I believe it was dropped at the factory while they were packaging it to ship, probably knowing that they damaged it but went ahead and shipped it anyway. This was made in China and they don't really care what they send to us Americans. I decided to keep it and not make a fuss since it still works perfectly and I don't need the hassle. It works great, and I am thinking about ordering another one for the lake."
5,The Bomb,I love it!! Has become one of my all time favorites!!! Would highly recommend to anyone of my family and friends
3,customer service,"The outdoor fireplace came with a broken wheel. When I called Landmann, the abrupt response was that I would get a replacement in two weeks. After pointing out that the original delivery was in three days, their response was that I didn't buy it from them. In front of me was a packing slip from Landmann which said bill to Amazon and ship to me.Particularly in view of today's economy it seems that customer service has gone out of the window and the wrong people are employed."
3,Adequate...,"This is a rather cheaply made product from China, it is wobbly but does the job. I would have been happier if it were made from a heavier gauge of steel."
2,Now I know why it was such a good price.,"Not all of the parts were in the box when we received it. I ended up spending about 30 minutes in Home Depot looking for bolts to put it together. Some of the parts where not the right size and would not hold it together. Again, Home Depot.It did work well, but they need to do some quality control checks."
5,Awesome!,"Found on Amazon for lower cost than anywhere else and shipping was free! Easy to put together. Make sure you put sand in the bottom, otherwise you will warp bottom grate. Had couple of fires in this with very good results using standard-cut wood. Love that I can cook on this as well even though I haven't tried it yet. The only pit like this that I could find to cook on. Very good product would highly recommend to someone that wants a pit of this style."
2,Could be better,"Parts are cheap and came dented and scratched, lid fell off and the handled bent. Would go with a different brand next time. Tedious to put together."
1,Love a good fire,The fireplace was just the right size and easy enough to put together. The only problem was the grill grate. The chrome coating was peeling off to expose rusty metal underneath. I was very disappointed with this purchase.
4,Works Great,"I bought this not knowing how well it truely would function, and I have been very happy with it. Many hours of good blazing fires and solid construction. I would recomend this for any backyard fun."
4,Landmann Fireplace,"We have had the Landmann fireplace for nearly a week now. It is certainly sturdier than similar items that we viewed at the local stores. The size makes it easy to put in decent size logs and the heavy grating and lid add security from flying sparks and ash. We have used it about 5 times now. For effective smores, you do have to start out without the surround grate and lid, but once the kids have had their fun, you can add a few more logs and put those items back in place to enjoy a roaring fire outdoors. The only negative things I can say is that I noted the black interior paint is burning off, but with an item used for fire, this is expected. Also, it is somewhat inconvenient to have to remove the lid to add logs, but it's not a deal breaker. Note to manufacturer to add a door on the side to open would be a nice touch. The additional grilling grate is a nice touch although we haven't tried it yet. Overall, we are very happy with this purchase."
2,Not Pioneers Best,"I purchased this item from Amazon.com because it's very difficult to find Pioneer products in my area. I must say I am very pleased with Amazon and the shipping method. AS far as the product, not Pioneers best. Very slow to load disc. Makes alot of noise,doesn't sound smooth , mechanisms sound cheap. Does not have optical output. But overall, it works so far....."
4,Good condition,"Good book. However, it was tied to a website that cost extra to use. The book works as a stand-alone as well. Be aware that though it is 12th edition is a REVISED 12th edition so check carefully when you compare this to what is required for your class."
5,Amazon has it all,"The product is great my point is that I could not locate this product in the big box home centers, so I tried Amazon at they had it to me in a few days"
3,"Fresh, but small in size","I received the 2 lb bag of Macadamias very quickly. The quality and freshness of the nuts are good, however they are very small and came mostly in halves. I ordered from another vendor in the past and those nuts were twice the size of these and most of them were whole."
3,I can't get used to the 'fodors layout' but it's really good.,"In spite of the fact I'm not used to the fodor's books layout, I think it's a good guide.Sometimes I feel it aims to a 'not low budget' public. (and I always backpack on low budget)...Regarding the ""paperback"" quality: some pages got lost, the book spine got 'broken', that's something I miss about lonely planet quality.The overall result of this guide, was, for me, good."
4,Aviation Action Adventure - A Man's Book,"The author writes very well and the plot is a good one. Aging German pilots decide to challenge American Air Aces to combat one-more-time. Perhaps only a male reader would understand the ""need"" to re-fight a lost war with all the trappings of restored aircraft, uniforms, and military customs (all this might be lost on a female reader). A good tension-packed read wherein you cannot wait to see what happens next. Good editing would have cut this book 15% or so, since some scenes and conversations are repetitious, but that is my only criticism. I would recommend this book to my male friends without reservation."
3,binoculars,This did not come with a safety strap......nor could you purchase one for the model.This is upsetting because binoculars should have a safety strap incase you drop them and for ease of carring.
4,Blue,"This is an awesome song. My friend told me how cool it was, but I didn't know til another friend finally let me listen to his Eiffel 65 CD. The song helps people(me included)see that they're not alone in their sadness. Also, it's sort of funny. It sounds like Eiffel 65 is singing ""Blue, I'm in need of a guy."" I reccomend you get the single if you can."
5,I'm Blue,I personally think Eiffle 65 is the best band in the US.Blue may be the shortest song I ever heard but it rocks.If you like the song you will love the music video.You shouldn't buy the CD but you need to buy the music video.
5,This CD is DA BOMB!,"Although it's very repetitive, it's got an excellent beat and the mind-boggling lyrics(if you could can them lyrics) are so much fun that anyone that disses this CD is CRAZY!"
2,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!,"I remember being very excited when I heard that Steven Forrest and Jeff Green were teaming up to write an astrology book together--well, at least, to put together a two-volume collection of their seminar transcripts! What a let-down! With the exception of a few tid-bits of interesting information, most of the material contained within volume one of this book is worthless--at least to me. And it's a shame, because Steven Forrest is such a great astrological author. As for Jeff Green, although his Pluto book is pretty impressive, I've never really LIKED him as an author--too pompous, and way to wordy! Why Steven Forrest ever decided to team-up with this guy I'll never know! Save your money, folks, and pass this book by. Oh, by the way: stay away from volume 2, because it's even WORSE!"
1,poor quality hair dryer,"I bought this hair dryer because I was specifically looking for something quiet (started to worry about my hearing with some super loud hair dryers). I bought this hair dryer. It worked well until it got stuck on cold after a few months. Liked it enough to buy a second one. However, it, too, got stuck on cold, and the button dislodged, after 3 months. I should have learned my lesson the first time."
2,Limited lifespan,"Just like H. Harris, I've owned two of these (because they really are quieter than regular hair dryers) and both have failed after no more than a year or so. Given the higher cost of this model, I have no intention of purchasing another."
3,Great dryer...but doesn't last,"Each of my Sharper Image blow dryers have hit the skids within about 12-18 months. The back (filter end) kept falling off (I assume from the heat). The air concentrator piece kept falling off as well. I finally had to use them without either piece after I got tired of replacing them over and over. Finally, my second dryer's heating element went out while we were on an extended vacation, and by that time they no longer had it in the store to replace it.However...this model has produced the best results with my hair, leaving it fuller. I understand that Sharper Image is in a ""transition"" and has closed many of its stores. In fact, their web site says, ""Sorry to keep you in the dark..."" I would consider buying a different model of their blow dryer...hoping that they have improved their quality...that is, if it becomes available."
3,I want to love it - but it just seems to miss the target group,"I am so torn here. I love this book - my mother would love this book. So what's the problem? It's a feel good book that seems like it would better reach a new parent, a teen, or someone going through hard times better than a child.The story clearly has a moral tale to convey. I tend to like that, and I love the message on diversity. Unfortunately, as far as plot/story, it falls short. It fails to go beyond just a morality lesson. And for this, it failed to captivate either of my children.If the target audience are children: For lessons on friendship with story intact, try pumpkin soup. For a story about diversity and acceptance, try The Woman Who Outshone the Sun. For general moral tales - Zen Shorts."
5,Outstanding spirtual and environmental book for children.,"How do you explain what God is to children? As a parent, how do you explain about the importance of caring for the environment and all living creatures? This book accomplishes these things and more. The flowing text and beautiful water-color drawings inspire an understanding of Spirit that children and adults alike can relate to. If you have children, please share this book with them, my daughters love it. If you don't have children, buy this book as a gift for yourself, and read it often, to reconnect with the Spirit that is all around us and in everyone of us. Many thanks to Douglas Wood and Cheng-Khee Chee for such a beautiful book, it has become a family favorite."
2,"Not for very young children, or non-religious folks","... it's not for everyone, and it's not for kids of all ages. It was given to me by someone who perhaps thought it was a story about a turtle I could read to my infants (there's no reference to religion on the cover, and the book is located in children's sections), when it was much, much too long and slow for probably any child under 3 -- and of course, it's about religion, not animals. My twins love books, but as toddlers they never had the patience to get through this one. Neither could I. And if you're not religious, or (worse) cynical about religion, you'll never get through the book either. ...It's really only for people who enjoy religion."
5,Beautiful story! Beautiful illustrations!!,I have read this countless times and never tire of reading it. Such beautiful story!! The illustrations alone are beautiful and the telling of such an important lesson is wonderfully inspirational. Loved it! If you like this you may also enjoy Zen Stories and Starfish on the Beach.
5,Thought provoking words of wisdom!,"The words of Mr. Woods are timely. The book promotes unconditional love toward everyone. Hearing Mr. Woods narrate his own book provided an even deep depth to the spiritual aspect of life. And now that the book has been put to music, it will even provide another avenue of spreading the good word."
5,"A thought-provoking, smile-inducing, really groovy story","The Old Turtle is truly an incredible book that works on so many levels. The author incorporated his love of, and respect for, the environment, as well as his concept of God, into a very well-written, enjoyable story. The illustrations were beautifully done and work so well with the subtle, underlying theme of the story. While the book will surly be enjoyed by children of all ages, I purchased it for a Christmas gift for my 28 year old sister. Likewise, I intend to buy another copy for myself so that I can continue to enjoy it, and share it with my children when I have them. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to humans of all ages."
5,Old Turtle,"This is the most extraordinary book with a message of love, peace and hope for a better world. It transects the boundaries of culture, ethnicity, gender and places the reader in a beautiful place within the spirit. Exquisite illustrations and fine literature will please those with the most discerning tastes. If you want to give something of lasting beauty to the children or even adults in your life, you will make them a gift of ""Old Turtle."""
5,Beautiful story and illustrations!,This is a wonderful gift for any child's birthday or baptism! The story is timeless and the illustrations are absolutely beautiful!
4,Decent!,"The poster is in good condition, I can't complain about it other than a thick white border surrounding the product image, however the border can always be removed. So when considering this product, don't worry about quality- it has all the quality you need."
3,"Provides entertainment, but hard to please the game!","This game is pretty lifelike, lots of good info, but there are also some bad points about it. For one thing, it is hard to get a lot of ""points"" because things are a little oversimplified. A real vet would almost always perform a complete physical (or should) and you lose points in this game for doing so. Also it is sometimes hard to tell exactly what the game wants you to do next. Another problem with this game is that there are some mistakes. For example, in one case,the written history provided for the animal doesn't match what the vet tech is telling you. There are also gliches in the trivia game, where sometimes your available choices are not complete/the end of a phase is missing."
5,A WONDERFUL REALISTIC GAME,"I played this game at my friends house. I felt that I was right there. It is so realistic I started to sweat. The game is not very easy but after a while of playing it I couldn't get my eyes of the screen. I suggest to all animal lovers/future vets, like me, to buy this great game!"
3,If confusing is what you want.....,"I love all RPG Sierra games and I love animal science. I do have to admit the trivia is very enlightening and the 'easy' level is ok...but I spent money on this I really didn't have and I must admit, I'm somewhat disappointed. The game is very confusing and there are very few instructions in the book. I'm still looking through the book to see if I missed something but I don't think so because other people that have rated this game under 3 stars found the same thing I did. Well, I wouldn't say it's a total waste of money, but if you're an impatient gamer, maybe you should put this on the back burner."
5,Vets R Cool,This is incredibly lifelike. It is a great game for all animal lovers and sim crazy people. I love it.
1,What kind of corny trash is this??,"This is the most corny, dumb piece of software i've ever seen. I know it's about saving animals and all, but this is, well, TRASHY, BABYISH, INCREDIBLY UNREALISTIC GAME EVER!!!! The other vets treat you like a baby. This game is not much more than a very limited, way too easy, and boring game. You have about 15-20 patients, then the game is over. DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!"
4,Very Nice,"This is really great piece, and it will be much realistic after 1 month in he water, I loved it."
4,Pretty Neat,"This decoration fits nicely in my 10-gallon aquarium. My apple snail loves to crawl in all the nooks and crannies, and I'm sure any fish would love to explore in it, or use it as a hiding place. It's a nice touch to any aquarium setup."
3,not as expected,I thought that because this product was described as medium that it would be a little large than it was I guess I should have made more attention to the product description however I do think under closer examination I might have accidentally received a size down from what I purchased :( nothing I can do about it now
4,Great Decor,"This is really great piece, and it will be much realistic after 1 month in he water, I loved it."
2,not the same old mighty mite,"well, if you are like me, a fan of the old 10 amp original Mighty Mite.... you might be as dissappointed as I was with the Boss 9 amp version.... one would think that a drop of only one amp would not reduce the suction by half... or at least so it seems... works ok and will please anyone who hasn't had the earlier model...."
4,Loud but works well,"I agree with the other positive comments. This is a durable sucker if you can put up with the wind tunnel like noise. I've had mine for several years now and it still has a powerful motor and works well on carpet, hardwood, and other surfaces. Not a sophisticated vacuum so it doesn't filter as well as a Miele but if noise and allergens are not important to you, a very good, dependable product."
1,Blu Ray was not in English,"I was not aware that this Blu Ray was only in Italian and Japanese. To be honest, Italian is listed as the language in the product details section of the listing. However, there are also reviews raving about the English dub on the same page. Presumably these are for other vendors who are actually selling the English version.In any case, either the vendor or Amazon should really do something to clean up this listing. It is clearly misleading. Just something like ""Akira [Italian version]"" is all it would take for the listing title. I really don't think that's unreasonable.Two weeks after I returned the Blu Ray and still have not gotten a refund. I cannot recommend this vendor, but at least I've learned a lesson about paying closer attention to product listings."
5,Pain free for sure,"This workout offers exactly what it promises a pain-free posture and back thanks to a pain-free posture and workout. After doing the workout, I could feel the workout most in my abs--which are key to maintaining a good posture and a healthy back--and after only one session the chronic pain in my back, particularly lower back and glutes was minimized."
3,Review,Work by Stott appears to be repetitive in many of their CDs. Looks like the same material with different CD titles.
3,doesn't follow the evidence,This is a great book to start a study of Custers Last Stand. However the author jumbles a few key references together and then makes an enormous miscalculation that ignores all the indian accounts as to the fate of the 28 men in DEEP RAVINE. It still is a good starting point and contains a wealth of good information
3,An Englishwoman love letters,"Pleasant read, however not a great one. Hard to imagine it was written by an Englishwoman.I would hesitate to recommend it, unless someone wants a fast innocuos read."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was not happy with this game. I realized that the only thing you can do in this game is build. You have to continually build things. There's nothing more to it. You can't sit back and watch your colony like you would watch your mall in Mall Tycoon, becauseyou can't even see the people. The graphics are horrible and honestly I wouldn't consider this a good buy at all. If you're looking to buy this for someone as a gift, don't."
3,Moon Tycoon,This game is really fun and it keeps you on your toes. The only problem with it is that all you do is build and repair. If you stop building there is nothing else to do. That might be alright for some people though. If you're buying this game then I have a suggestion. Once you start building mines and factories you should set the game to auto-sell. Otherwise you run out of money all the time.
3,flicker,"The game is fun, but the right side of the screen flickered constantly. It gave me a headache and was very annoying. There was no way to stop the horrible flickering and it was major flickering. This was the second game that I purchased and both disks did the same thing."
5,Move over SIM city you've been replaced,Moon tycoon is HOT!!Make you own Lunar colony!! Control every aspect of life on the moon.Control the number of tourist attracttions and much more!!Even control mining and scientific industries!! Buy this COOL game and you wiil be hooked on it for hours!!You've never regret buying plus it's very cheap!
1,Moon Tycoon Graphics Problems,"We have a HP pavilion mx70, 800 MHz Intel Celeron processor with 64 MB of SDRAM & up to 11 MB allocated to video memory and even though I went out on the net & upgraded our Intel 82810 Graphics Controller to the latest upgrade, it still wouldn't run this program without losing graphics. Very quickly, while building on the moon the graphics begin to fall apart to the point that you can't even see a great deal of the graphics. At first we thought it was the CD so we returned it & got a new one, but it was just as bad. Then we got the upgraded graphics driver & it started out a little better, but still started breaking up."
5,Great Fun !,"Highly recommended!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Watching my 4 year old use this item was really exciting.She followed along watching the DVD on the TV and really drew Cinderella!Which just happens to be ""Her favorite movie of all time""The DVD comes with 18 different characters to draw, all from the best princess movies. What is really great is that the book that comes withthe DVD has these pages with the characters already started.So it was easier for her to follow along.It also has markers and crayons, so after she drew cinderella it was fun to color it in.She spent almost an hour drawing, which was one of the longest times she spent playing with a toy.Highly recommended!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great product,"This is a great product - my 4 year old granddaughter loves to draw with it, especially practicing on the dry erase part to practice first. I would highly recommend it."
1,"Great for a 5 year old, terrible if you are serious",This locket is half an inch in size. That's small enough for your sweetie to swallow. The only thing you can fit in this thing is a peeble. Its so small you couldn't make out anything if you COULD get a picture in there. The clasp that holds it together is so tight you need a screwdriver to get it open. Don't waste your time or money with this.
1,Major Disappointment,Spent 30 minutes on the phone with tech support and still could not get game to work. Installing game would shut the whole computer down. No fix available and only suggestion is to either wait for a fix by continuing to watch website for a patch or send it back to company for refund which must be done within 90 days of purchase. I will be sending it back for a refund. Can't believe they didn't test this game better before releasing it to the public. Have one very disappointed little girl on our hands since this was the only computer game she received for Christmas!
4,Cat to the Rescue,"My husband bought this game for our 4 year old daughter's Christmas gift. She loves to play it, and actually goes to level 4 , with a little help from her father, by herself. Whenever she starts getting cranky, we always call on Cat's help, as she loves to play this game...She also loves it as she spends quality time playing with her father."
1,Zero stars,Don't buy this game! It totally crashes my pc (Compaq wi WinXP)and from the other posts it appears I am not alone. This is a relatively new PC with pleny of memory and processor. Did not make for a happy Christmas moment!I am always extra disappointed when the manufaturer has a lame web site with no support like VU. Did the driver update dance etc..no luck.
1,Not worth it unless it's fixed,Installed the software on three systems that all far exceed the minimum system (and recommended) requirements. Game wouldn't start on any of them. No patch is available on the vendor's support website.
1,0 stars -- Could not play game!,"It is comforting to know, after reading the other reviews, that I wasn't the only one having problems getting this game to work.Even after installing more memory and updating my video card driver so that my system would far exceed the requirements, the game still caused my system to crash. There must have been a rush to get this game out in time for the movie release. I too have one disappointed youngster since Christmas morning -- guess this gift goes back to Santa."
1,"Cat in the Hat,,, it's good, but it's not all that.","Though somewhat juvinile I found the game still enjoyable. It was challenging sometimes because it was genuinally difficult to do some of the thing that needed to be done, and other times it was because they didn't explain well enough what you had to do in certain situations. Because of that, I recomend that everyone new to the game look at control settings to find out what moves this cat has up his hat. One of the reasons I enjoyed the game is because I enjoyed the movie. Although not in a story mode, it was still fun to chase Quinn out of every corner of the mutant house. However I must warn some people that the extra points are not just bonuses. Sometimes you will need a certain amounts of points if you want to continue the game, plus if you get all the points out of a level, that part of the house goes back to normal. For boss lovers I'm sorry to say that their are only two of them. That's why I think that the Cat in the Hat is a mixed bag."
5,ink for HP printer,Purchased the printer ink cartridges double pack on 8-18-08 they arrived on 8-23-08..Had done the research for the lowest price on the doubles on other sites. Amazon was the lowest of the sites checked. Service from seller was fast. Will be a return customer.
5,What choice do you have,Unelss you want to risk the generic cartridges - with which I have had horrible experiences - you have to go with these. They work great.
3,Do not buy from J&R Music and Computer World,"I never got the product. There was a shipping problem that was not J&R's fault. However, J&R refused to work with me and UPS to rectify the problem. J&R's customer service failed miserably. Amazon's A-to-Z Guarantee stepped up to the plate and did a great job where J&R failed. Way to restore my faith Amazon."
2,Where's the ink?,I inserted the color cartridge into the printer and three weeks later I needed a new one. I was gone two of those three weeks on vacation and did not print anything in color the other week. Where did the ink go? Just asking...
4,HP printer HP ink,"HP printer HP ink. Pop out the old snap in the new, wham bam thank you your printing again. Couldn't be easier and it lasts longer then refills."
5,HP Ink Cartridges,"It arrived on time and price was cheaper than buying at local stores. Hey, it works. What more is there to be said?"
5,"Great Price, Same Product!",I'm so happy I found this provider on here. I saved a lot of money and got the exact same product I would have bought at the local office supply stores.
1,No bargain,"The seller wrote ""Sold my printer do not need these new unopened cartridges.""I thought I was getting a bargain when I purchased a HP ink cartridge for my printerfor a fraction of the retail price. The black cartridge print is gray, and the color cartridge print is very pale."
4,Great Price,Great Price and fast service from the supplier but as with most cartriges they don't last long. I got about 100 pages with 25% coverage on the color one.
5,Printer Cartridges,Hewlett Packards' quality is much better than a no-name brand or a re-inking cartridge. Colors are more vivid and it lasts longer.
5,Works fine with HP 7310xi,"Hated to spend the big bucks for these versus the refilled options out there, but the last refilled ones I bought wouldn't work consistently in my HP 7310xi, the ""chips"" that they put in them now seem to stop my printer from even working (dirty HP rascals)! These are the real deal and just by installing them my printer works like new again. Still wishing for cheaper options that work consistently though, this is too much money for just ink!!"
4,Got what I expected,The product was exactly what I was looking for. The price was good and the delivery time was fast. I couldn't ask for anything more.
1,poor quality,Bought 3 of the combo packs. None of the color cartridges worked. Returned and received prompt refund. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,WHERE OH WHERE IS MY STOCK SHIPMENT,"Placed a stock order on 9/20/10, and still no ship date. now product is 5% cheaper on Amazon, and i can't cancel, can't get delivery, can't print..."
2,Cartridge Review,"My black cartridge nbr 96 worked fine for a few sheets, then quit working entirely.The color cartridge nbr 97 works fine. Iwould have to ratethis purchase a two."
2,HP 06/97 Inkjet Print Cartridge,Price and shipping was excellant. The black ink cartridge is defective and will not work in the printer.This was NOT sold by Amazon but by one of thier vendors. I was contacted asking about my experience. I explained the defective cartridge. Received a response asking which cartridge was defective. As I purchased mutiple cartridges and wasn't very clear about which is defective. They(Go Fast Parts) however havn't responded back.
2,Attempted to bribe me to change feedback.,I had no problem with purchase until the company has tried to bribe me to change my feedback. I just want to know how i can get them to leave me alone?
1,never received goods ordered,"Order placed on OCtober 20 still never delivered on December 22All attempts to contact seller have failed. They have never responded. My credit card was charged $133.39, goods were never received.DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!"
5,cartridges,The cartridges were the same quality that I expected and the price was very reasonable. I will buy these again!
3,BNUENO,ME HA SALIDO BIEN EL PRODUCTO ADQUIRIDO ATRAVEZ DE ESTE MEDIO QUE TAMBIEN HA SIDO MUY CONFIABLE Y PRACTICO PARA MI. GRACIAS.
4,Original HP 96/97 Ink Cartridges combo-pack,"I am very pleased with my purchase. I am a repeat customer of this product. My purchases always come on time. Best of all, I like the substantial savings I get from Amazon and its dealers, as compared to local office products suppliers."
2,Unless you enjoy archaic writing and like to fall asleep...,"I read reviews for ALL of the books I buy on Amazon. I have 70 some-odd books now about Rome: straight history, biographies and historical fiction. The reviews are usually pretty accurate. EXCEPT FOR WITH THIS BOOK! I read the 6 reviews currently out there which average 5 stars, and I can say that I completely disagree. The author's use of the English language is frustrating to me. I have a college degree...yet I don't want to read something that comes off like Shakespeare, because I don't enjoy that. I want something that flows, something that I don't have to re-read because I lost focus or couldn't follow the archaic writing style. Simply put, I am now reading two other books while this one sits, half read, awaiting another attempt to finish it. And only because I am stubborn will I be able to attain this goal. This book, to me, is simply not that good."
1,half of order missing,"I ordered two bottles, and they mixed up my order and sent me one bottle of Clemastine and one bottle of something else. I had to ship back the wrong bottle and call customer service to send me another one. I never got the 2nd bottle of Clemastine."
5,Good medicine,"Clemastine works very well for allergies. Buying it through Amazon is cheaper and more efficient than searching for it in drugstores, which don't always have it, and never in this size. Excellent product."
2,Face Product,In regard to Nutri Lift.I do not think the product proforms that was advertised. I wouldnot purchase it again. Saw no improvement.
5,Works for me.,"I've been using Nutalift Rejuvenating ""A"" for about 7 years. Decided I should write a review. I have problems with breakouts and as long as I use this I don't breakout. I'm 62 now and people are surprised because my skin is very smooth. I'm sure heredity has something to do with it but, I know I would have more fine lines and deeper wrinkles had I not been using Nutralift for so long. I've switched products from time to time and always go back. I don't know if the gold does anything but, the matrix 3000 does. I apply this after cleansing and then apply a very light weight moisturizing lotion. In the summer I use a SPF 30 moisturizer after applying Nutalift."
3,Life is not what it seems,This is a charming story about a green tree frog who is bored. He wants to be different. So he gets his wish and falls into a jar of jelly beans and turns all the different colors of the jelly beans. The rest of the story is how the frog tries to change back to the way he was. It is a great story for children under 6 years. It shows a child that it is ok to be yourself.
5,Love it,I purchased this at a local home show.....it is awesome stuff....love the blend of hot and sweet...
3,"Okay, but beware of size.","If you are looking for a home for a large crab, look elsewhere. When I received these shells in the mail, I was shocked. If these shells are a large then I would hate to see what a small looks like. They are very pretty, heavy feeling, smooth shells; but none of my crabs are the right size to wear them. They are too small for either of my large crabs, (whom they were intended for) and far too big for the baby. Looks like I'll have to find a pet store where I can pick shells out in person with no surprises."
1,Living off the reputation of past members.,"It's extremely disappointing to buy a cd by your favorite band, and then discover that not one single original member is in the group (credits listed only on the inside). To those unfamiliar with the true Molly Hatchet this may be an acceptable cd...however, when compared to any of the early releases the music comes across as""forced"" and somewhat lackluster. Nice try, but in the end it's a case of living off the reputation of a great band, that sadly, no longer exists."
5,Absotively Posilutely Awesome!!,"Do not need the maximum of 1,000 words to describe this cd. Honestly, in my opinion, this is the best Hatchet your money can buy. Period!!"
4,Excellent Hatchet,"If you like Molly Hatchet, or if you've never heard of them, but crave that southern fried multi-guitar attack monster from decades past, then this album is a must own. ""Down From the Mountain,"" is a blazing example of what southern rock is all about, with it's acoustic dobro beginnings giving way to the overdriven fat-sounding Gibsons played through their Marshall stacks. The complicated guitar weaves on, ""Come Hell or High Water,"" are flawless. ""Rolling Thunder,"" is a thoughtful tribute to Vietnam Veterans, the thunder being from the Harley-Davidson riding veterans that gather in our nation's capitol each year at the Vietnam Veteran's Memorial. Of course, don't forget the acoustic remake of, ""Dreams I'll Never See."" This is an excellent Hatchet offering. The song keeping this entire album from earning five stars is, ""Look In Your Eyes."" This song is terrible, and should have been left off the album, the other cuts are well worth the money."
5,It met and exceeded my expectations!,"Amazon send out an email asking about that so I figured I'd poke fun at this. Yes, this plastic elbow did exactly what I needed it to. I'd also like to note it works just fine on my Jeep (unlike what Amazon specifies). This should be compatible with just about any Jeep with the 4.0 engine (Mine being a 1993)"
3,NEED A CONTROLLER,This game is great. I rented it on Playstation 2 and I loved it. So I bought it for the computer. The training in the begining took me about an hour. It only took me about 10 minutes on playstation. The problem is the controlls. It is much easier to get the hang of the controlls with a controller. The game is good after you get over the controlls first.
4,No One Lives Forever,Great game! Lots of plot and character personality. Gameplay is smooth and fun. Open ended enough to get lost but not forever. It's Deus Ex with estrogen.
5,Be Careful,"This game is extremely fun and buying game of the year edition is definitely worth it since you get a bonus level. I'm telling everyone who already knew that about my experience on Amazon. I've bought this game twice because I was hoping for the original GOTY with all the packaging and everything but instead I bought the new one which is the same game but doesn't come with the soundtrack, Prima strategy guide, or even the game booklet that comes in the case. If you want any of those things then read the description on the used copies because that's the only place you'll find them"
4,Game Of The Year,"NOLF is one of the more fun games I own. I'll admit the graphics leave alot to be disired but they are not horrible. Anyway I don't play games for the graphics I play for the gameplay. This Game Is a must have, in more ways than one. It has masive online Battle Arena's made from parts of levels in single player. You can play against people from Japan and South America, as well as other places. This is just an example of the masiveness of the online Arenas. NOLF single player is even better. Skillfully crafted worlds are ripe for your rightous hand (clutching your trust worthy Parabelum 9mm of course)to have its way with. The levels range from Germany, to a Space Station, to a trapicol paradice. This game is definatly worth your money and your time."
4,"Very fun game, minor WinXP problems","I decided to play NOLF when I finished NOLF2. I expected the graphics to be outdated (and they were) but it's not a big deal. This game is centered on the story and gameplay, which are both superb (and hilarious).I'm running this game in WinXP, which isn't ""officially"" supported. And, there are problems. One, the black letterboxes during cutscenes are half-transparent. Two, every time a new area loads, my video becomes very choppy and ugly (as if video acceleration isn't being used). A quick fix is to go to the display options and change the resolution (to any value). This seems to [beat] the video-card ... until the next area-load, where you have to repeat the process.Over-all, it is what I expected accept for the technical problems.System:Athlon XP 1600+512MB RAMRadeon 9500 Pro Video (128MB RAM)Windows XP ProSound Blaster Live! 5.1Catalyst 3.1 driversDirectX 9"
5,Great FPS,"Bought this after browsing for an FPS after having completed ""Deus Ex"" and wanting another.I agree with many of the good reviews below. I'm surprised that it didn't do better in the stores. Forget about the ""cute"" aspects (unless you like them) such as bunny slippers and sleeping potions. This is a great FPS with good weapons, funny bad guys and a great storyline.Absolutely plan on getting NOLF2 when it becomes available."
1,I Can't Dig This,"Let me first say, that many people dig this stuff...avant-garde/free jazz stuff, and honestly, I've listened to a lot of it probably more than my ears can stand, but I have to say I just can't dig it. I've tried on so many occasions to like it, but this stuff is noise pollution to me. It's like running into someone on the street you don't like, after a few times, you make nice and chat with them, but after awhile, you start figuring out ways to avoid them everytime you see them. That's what Cecil Taylor's ""music"" is like. If you can dig this, then more power to you, but I have to have some substance in the music I listen to for me to dig it. Taylor's ""music"" is like book with a storyline that goes nowhere.This recording is totally devoid of melody, harmony, and rhythm, which are the three elements that make music the beautiful thing it is."
5,Funny,My 8 year old was cracking up when he read this book to me. He is in second grade and thought it top be hilarious as he has a 2 year old brother.
2,Ify,"It's looks cheap, for 5 bucks (add around 5 for shipping). I've seen a Transformers Movie Keychain of Bumblebee, which looks great, and for 4 bucks, at Toys'R'Us. This is the first product I bought from Amazon's 3rd Party Store that I was not really that satisfied.Kids will surely like this, so I gave it one more star."
1,Totally Disgusting!!!!,"I ordered this bulk item to save money. I opened the bag, and it smelled like nothing. NO taste, no smell.....thought it was a joke. Looks like talc. Totally disgusting!"
5,You Can`t Go Wrong With Laffy Taffy!,"I just love laffy taffy, cant get enough. These taste better just a little warmer than room temp, softer. Excellent All Around."
2,The author was an English teacher?,"""Murder Wears a Red Hat"" is lousy with unnecessary ""who cares?"" content that moves the story line slowly to NOWHERE. I feel terrible for the generations of the author's students who, if they followed her lead, now have absolutely no idea how to use a comma. And worse yet, how many of them are using ""everyday"" as a noun instead of an adjective? Ugh. Ms. Savidge should have allowed some editors to clean up her draft. They'd have had a field day. Murder must wear a red hat for good reason."
1,Bad purchase,"Let me start out by saying these are beautiful, but if you want them to light longer than 1 week you are out of luck.....I have had at least 9 of these and none of them lasted longer than 1 week.. They are terrible, and forget about dealing with Brinkmann. They do not want to know anything, they have no replacement parts, do not even respond to emails. Terrible customer service on Brinkmann's side. Amazon was great with the return, but why buy something if it is not going to perform.If I could have rated these a zero I would have"
1,poor lighting,"This was a gift, and after fully charging it, they said the light was extrememly poor. It makes a nice decoration, but by no means should be used for a 'safety' light."
2,Just a plain old DVD player,"Just a plain DVD player. Playes traditional DVD-R discs. Does not play DVD+Rs and DVD RWs. It played my home made DVD burnt in a DVD-R. It plays my Netflix DVDs well. Picture and sound quality is not more than just okay. It is region free so you can play other region DVDs here. I have a DVD full of MP3s and it does not detect half of them. No support for Divx, Xvid, WMV etc. Supports MPEG-1(VCD DAT files) and MPEG-2(DVD VOB files) only. Takes around a minute to detect a DVD when you insert it.Bottom line is: spend $10-15 bucks more and get a decent DVD player , specially if you play your home movies. If you are not very serious about quality and if you just play the movies rented from DVD libraries then you may consider buying it."
1,Very disappointing DVD Player,"I bought this unit, the DP-313, hoping it would be better than my favorite and very highly rated Norcent DP-300. But this player didn't play many DVD's, store-bought nor burnt DVD's. Also, the DVD's it did play ended up slowing down and showing artifacts. Ended up returning it."
3,Difficult to opine,"It was advertised as the top of the line bread machine with individual programming option.I followed the recipes to make French bread but the bread did not rise and remained under-baked.In the control Panasonic SD-YD250 machine -I also have one - the same recipe, same ingredients worked fine.I returned it to the manufacturer with photo documentation about the failure.They sent it back with suggestion as to what would be the right yeast-flour composition:manufacturer also included his photo documentation...I lost interest in the product as bread maker.Next was the pizza failure. Dough making program over-kneaded the dough to the pointit became sticky and unmanageable.Conclusion: I don't know why I could not make a decent French bread with this machine.I am reluctant to try endless variations with programs, and ingredients.My pizza dough was superb with manual kneading as you see on youtube pizza-making videos."
1,Disapponted,"Ordered this itme on 8/8/2010, and was told it would be shipped the nest Monday or Tuesday (9th or 10th). As of today (the 19th) still no words on when it might appear. Poor service and potential additonal actions to obtain the items in question"
3,"OK quality, great price","Dulls quickly. I use these in a drill press at very slow speed on oak. Never the less, the cutting blades dull in about 100 holes, each 1/4"" deep. Probably work great on pine or fir."
1,next to worthless,It stopped working about 3 months after I bought it. I sent it back to Beyond Micro where they hung onto it until I bugged them to send it back. It was working when I got it back but all my data was gone. No note from BM as to what happened. The component's shell was cracked and falling apart. Nice job Beyond Micro! There's a very good reason their stuff is cheap: it sucks.
3,Chris Joss brings out the jazz soul vibes,"'You've Been Spiked' is a swirling stew of soul, jazz, and lounge music. The two opening tracks are stunning Medeski Martin And Wood-meets-DJ Logic jazz romps, groovy instrumentals that almost entices you to hear more. Generally the rest of the CD is a combination of the smooth soul of 70's blaxploitation soundtracks and jazz/lounge electronica, eg, Zero 7 and Air. There's also the kitsch of sexy-spaced-out scores like 'Shake Sauvage' and 'Beat At Cinecitta'. Chris Joss opens with a powerful punch, and after the high, allows you to chill-out and hang loose. Images of lava lamps, vinyl, and polyester bell-bottoms not included. 'You've Been Spiked' is a strong album for it's musicality and ability to capture the spirit of another time. One of my favourite albums of the year."
2,"Not recommended. At best, like Money Mark meets Ursula 2000","because this isn't as good as either (and, IMO, neither of those are very good anyways). kitschy half-baked organ jams with no discernable transitions - just riding one groove for far too long then starting another song.unless you're a real devotee to hammond sounds in a retro groove, this album isnt for you. if you like retro cool, there are TONS of better choices: thunderball's scorpio rising, ESL's comp titled dubbed out in DC, dzihan & kamien's gran riserva, united future organization's 3rd perspective, etc."
5,best,"I use this often, and found this product to one of the best on the market.Easy to use,and it does the job."
3,OK.. But not as expected,"Ive had this cd well over a year. Its OK, but you really have to be in the mood for it. You must have time to listen.Its dark, moody, cold and some of the songs drag a bit. The ambiance is good, but the songs tend to stay mid paced and lack a particular structure.Its OK, but nothing i would highly reccomend to the average metal listener. Even far removed for old Celtic fans. But good for a listen or 2 here and there. 'Domain of Decay' sounds a bit like old frost though. And the track 'Obscured' is just moody, cold, dark and perfect.I credit them for doing what they wanted. And its not bad, just different."
2,Compression 1 - Celtic Frost 0,"It is really a shame what they are doing to records these days. This otherwise very good music has been completely compressed to death. Not a little bit, we're talking completely straight line. This moronic pursuit of loudness is killing the sound. The drums and cymbals are wrecked on this disc. It makes me angry because there's nothing you can do to fix it. There's a very clear reason why modern metal albums don't hold up as well as their older generation counterparts. It's because of the crummy recording techniques they are using. You don't want to turn these albums up nice and loud because there's no power there, the music has nowhere to go, it's completely flattened. Compression does not equal heaviness, it just fatigues the ears. This music deserves better than this abuse."
3,Why bother to keep the name Celtic Frost?,"This music is so unlike the Celtic Frost I remember (I stopped getting their albums at Into the Pandemonium). This music really just sounds like modern metal today. Overall, I am very disappointed. I like the first song and one other, and the rest are totally generic. It's a very weak album."
2,OLD SCHOOL FANS BEWARE!,this is not a return to the morbid tales style frost. the 1st track is good and the album is produced well and it is heavy but it is not a thrash album. i would call it more of a doomy type record. the songs are long and quite slow. it is worth having in the collection though.
3,Mediocre,"good production, decent singing but too monotonous. Morbid Tales is SO much better than this. i am going to see them in new york so hopefully i'll get to hear some of my old favorites. imo cf rocked best when they played medium or fast tempo - NONE on the new album."
1,This is Celtic Frost?,"I have been a Celtic Frost fan since the 80's. I truly believe CF is one of the most innovative and original bands ever. They were definitely the pioneers of the Black Metal and Doom genres. That being said words cannot describe the sheer disappointment I felt when I first heard ""Monotheist"". Their first release in years is utterly awful and unbearable to listen to...and I tried real hard. This album makes ""Cold Lake"" sound like a musical masterpiece. I gave this album one star out of respect to the band that released such classics like To Mega Therion, Into The Pandemonium and Vanity/Nemesis. If this was the direction CF was planning on taking before the drama queen Tom Warrior left the band...then I'm very glad."
2,Bleak,"As I listened to ""Monotheist,"" I could only visualize guitarist/vocalist Tom Warrior being bummed out to the point of no return. That's a bad thing. The vibe here is cold, bleak...from the scariest reaches of existence. Afterwards, I was unable to find enjoyment in anything at all for a day. ""Dark"" barely describes the complete downer that is this album, and I won't be revisiting it again anytime soon. Gone are CF's piledriver riffs, thrash, wild tempo-shifts and experimental impulses. Here, they deliver agonizing, existentially painful songs that offer few hooks, melodies or grooves - only a morass of solemnity. Sure, there are days when I feel this way right along with him, but musically speaking I don't find that these songs transcend the experience. ""Monotheist"" is just pure bitterness."
5,"Not like old Frost, but killer in all ways.","I'll admit, I'm one of the fans that would do just about anything to hear another Morbid Tales. I knew from friends and reviewers on here that that wasn't going to happen. Still, this is a killer release from one of the greatest bands of all time. Don't be scared away by reviews that use words like 'ambient' or 'experimental'. There's some weird stuff going on but there's no way you'll be sitting there thinking you're listening to some fake sounding band, it's all pure Frost the entire way through. All you have to know about this CD is that if it's not in your CD player right now, you need to cough up some $$$ and get it. Hail the new era of Celtic Frost!"
1,Missed Opportunity,"After the sheer lunacy that was Cold Lake some 18 years ago, you think that the Frosties could come up with something better than this snorfest. I always give something I don't like on the first listen, several chances to peak my interest. With Monotheist, I can't even get through it to give it that chance! The recording is poor and the songs go nowhere. Sure, the music and haunting sounds make for an evil and somewhat disturbing record, but I ain't buying it. Frost has never been the most talented lot and their ""career"" has been hit and miss (big). This just doesn't do it for me. Maybe I shouldn't have come in with such high expectations. Where's my ""Into the Pandemonium"" CD? Ah, that's better....."
3,"Ambitious, some good moments, but sags over-all","I'm an old fan. I witnessed Celtic Frost live in 1986; ""Into the Pandemonium"" is one of my all time favorite records. Unfortunately, every time I think ""Monotheist"" has me, it stumbles. Not a bad addition to the CF legacy....but they have done better."
3,Has anyone bought from this company?,"These books are on demand, which most of us know as ""we print them as they are ordered"". Also, this is a newer company. I just want to get a read on whether the quality of the books is very high. If so this would be a great way to purchase the set as I can afford them. I don't know if there's a similar deal somewhere for the Great Books instead of the Harvard Classics?"
5,This Book Got Me Through!,"A week ago the concept of creating HTML Help was beyond me. Not any more. I completed every activity in this wonderful book and now I feel confident that I can create HTML Help on my own.This is a very complete book, and it even covers some advanced HTML concepts... something I did not expect. I'm a web master and I love the way this book covers frames and forms. I have to admit that I should know those HTML concepts better, but the book taught me some stuff I had not considered.This book got me through!"
2,Primarily Navigational Help,"Fairly light - I was looking for more detail and discussion of advanced RH features. Not much more depth than provided by the application tutorial. :(This book is ok if you know very little about windows, navigation, MS-word-like features.Little help for the price."
3,Infomercial for Billy bands,"This video should have been sold with the Billy bands or a disclaimer stating the video is designed for the bands. Billy Blanks spends a lot of time telling you how much better the workout would be with the bands. He has one person not using the bands who he tells you to follow if not using the bands, she is 2 rows behind Billy to his right and often not visible (not much help). The video itself is fine, you just need to be prepared with the right equipment."
4,Motivation,"What is the most valuable on this DVD is Billy's charm that motivates you and makes you smile even when you feel fat, hard and lazy... It is easy to believe that ""you are gonna do it"". I think this matters the same as the professionally chosen and conducted exercise. It helps both the body and the soul to stay fresh."
2,Yawn....,"I'm a very advanced exerciser, so I was hoping this would give me a good workout. i was a little sore but not much. It's fairly useless without ""Billy Bands,"" although with it's a good strength-training workout, but NOT aerobic, like I was hoping."
4,Great workout,I love the workout but you do need resistance bands and I wish I would have known that before buying it so I wasn't all ready to do the workout and didn't have the correct equipment
2,Tae Bo Workout,This product is for beginners. It's not as intense as the advanced workouts but will keep you moving with the routines.
3,It's good,"I liked the first few minutes of this workout, really made me sweat, but then the workouts were with the Billy Bands (not included) and it doesn't even tell you they're needed."
2,Not Impressed,"I was disappointed with this DVD. You have to spend$15.00 for ""Billy Bands"" if you want to get a moderately good workout. Generic resistance bands may work for you, but if you are going to invest any time in this DVD, you should probably just get the ""Billy Bands"" so that you can do all of the movements correctly without risking injury. Without the use of the bands, this workout is okay for someone new to exercise or someone who wants to add something new to their regular regime to keep from getting bored. Frankly though, there are much better and more efficient workouts for people of all levels of fitness. In addition, the music is annoying... like the soundtrack for an 80's video game. That being said, the older Tae Bo workouts are much better than this one! For the price, one would be best off skipping this workout and the $15.00 ""Billy Bands"" and getting 2 of the older Tae Bo DVDs."
4,"Great Seller, modest product","When I ordered this product I did not realize the board folded into one fourth its full size, this created a somewhat awkward playing surface for my small Grandchildren. Consequently I gave this a less than optimum rating on Amazon. Subsequently the Seller has offered to replace the unit. This is admirable behavior and if I could, I would withdraw my previous rating! Not being able to withdraw my rating, I am leaving this review as evidence that this Seller is making every effort to make ammends. Most likely I should have realized this was not a bifold board such as I grew up with, and this this was most likely ""Buyer Error"". Mea Culpa!Bottom Line: Excellent Seller!"
3,Checkers,"Not quite as durable as I would have hoped. The board folds into quarters, instead in half. Shipping was pretty horrible as the box arrived completely smashed."
3,Checkers,This is a cute game to allow my kids to learn the game of checkers but it is so cheaply made. The board fell apart on the first day we opened it.
4,Starter board,"I got this because my 5 year old daughter was interested in checkers. The board and all of the pieces were intact, that's about all you can ask for considering the price. The board folds up kinda funky in order for it to fit into the box. I can see over time the board will probably be damaged, but again, for the money it is fine."
4,My 6 year old is obsessed!,My daughter received a checkers set for Christmas and is nearly obsessed with playing it. I think it's great! She's really getting better already and I think it's a great way to develop logic and thinking/concentration skills. The gift was a big hit!
4,Woodstock D1309 6-Inch Diameter PSA 100 Grit Aluminum Oxide sanding discs,I ordered discs of several grits to use on my sander and Woodstock D1309 6-Inch Diameter PSA 100 Grit Aluminum Oxide sanding discs are sound and perform well for my work.
1,Scudder without purpose,"I have but one more Scudder book to read to be all caught up. Have LOVED them all, even though I am not a ""crime/mystery"" novel afficiando -- ALL EXCEPT this one. Took it on a LONG plane ride, expecting the usual Block thriller. BORING and definitely forced - must have been a little writer's block and deadline due."
2,Glacial pace,I got to about the mid-way point of this book (after many attempts over a two week period to read it) and finally gave up. It was an ok read up until that point but then it seemed as if I was treading water and couldn't advance the pages even though I'd sit and read it for an hour at a time. Very frustrating.
2,Not up to standards,"I think Lawrence Block is a great writer, but this book failed to hold my interest. Usually I have a difficult time putting Block's books down; this one, on the other hand, I had a difficult time keeping up."
2,I didn't really care for this L. Block novel--too lame.,"Scudder's defense lawyer friend discovers himself on the list of ""The Will"" The Will is a serial killer who announces his victims in advance, and seeks to avenge himself on victims who seem to need to be killed. When Scudder's protection is broken and the lawyer is killed, Scudder sets off after the serial killer.I think this could have been a very good novel if Block would have taken a bit more time with it, and worked with the plot and sub-plots."
2,Quality of the series is not holding up,"I have been a big Lawrence Block/Matt Scudder fan and have often recommended books from the series to friends. However, I find that beginning with the previous book in the series, A Long Line of Dead Men, the fun has left the the Scudder books as they become mostly talk and very little action. I still would highly recommend all previous Scudder books -- of which there are 11, but it's time for Block to put this PI to sleep. Now that Scudder has become a permanently sober, legitimate P.I., and stick-in-the mud married middle-aged gum shoe, he is BORING."
2,NOT THE TOUGH GUY WITH THE DARK EDGE THAT WE KNOW & LOVE,"THIS BLOCK ENTRY IS NOT UP TO THE STANDARD OF THE PREVIOUS ""SCUDDER"" BOOKS. HE IS STARTING TO SOUND MORE LIKE THE ""BURGLAR"" OF BLOCK'S OTHER SERIES THAN THE SCUDDER SERIES. THE HARD EDGE THAT MAKES SCUDDER SCUDDER IS MISSING. NOT A TOTAL WASHOUT BECAUSE OF BLOCK'S GREAT SKILL AS A WRITER. IF THIS IS THE READERS FIRST EXPOSURE TO BLOCK, GIVE HIS EARLIER EFFORTS A SERIOUS LOOK, THEN JUDGE HIS ABILITIES AND THE MATTHEW SCUDDER SERIES."
2,confused story line obscures the author's strengths,"Non-Matt Scudder fans will wonder why all the enthusiasm for previous volumes with the same hero if this is the first book that they read. Block fails to embody his all too human hero with the life necessary to carry two plots. A re-reading makes the reader think that the book would have been better as a short story. Fans may enjoy revisiting the familiar cast of characters but readers looking for a great novel about New York and Scudder, the troubled detective, should perhaps find a copy of ""The Devil Knows You're Dead 0r any others in the Scudder canon"
3,disappointing effort by a master,"Matthew Scudder is back and the excitement is gone in this effort, the weakest of the wonderful series by Lawrence Block detailing the evolution of the life of a maturing ex-alcoholic New York City private investigator. Scudder here is involved in discovering the identity of two murderers, one a serial killer. Unfortunately, as Scudder has aged, married, and quit drinking, at least in this story, he's become much more boring. The plot is character-driven and simply not very interesting. I personally am hoping for Scudder to return to the bottle and for Block to return to the morally weaker and infinitely more enjoyable Scudder of yesterday"
3,The weakest Scudder book in the series.,"Scudder is incomparable. However, this is not a great book. You'll have figured out the killers well before the ending. Do yourself a favor and skip this book and re-read any of the other excellent Scudder books"
3,"Least graphic of Scudder series, enjoyable not thrilling","As mysteries go this was fairly enjoyable. Another reviewer is right, that Scudder turns into a ""superslueth,"" but not so super since everything could be seen a mile off. I got a bit impatient in the middle because of that, but then settled in for the ride, which was slow but not annoying. As mysteries go, you could certainly do worse. This is definitely not the best you'll get from Block, but there are worse ways to spend an afternoon."
5,Excellent,"That is a real nice software, I was really when it came in. The book contain good information on a lot of subject about jobs, interview.The videos in the software are so useful. Even each help file have a video, I never saw that, incredible. The job search engine is really powerful. I got that version for 10$, I am happy with it. There is a newer version, but this one have a lot of what version 12 have for a lot less$$$."
3,WinWay Resume Deluxe 11.0,"I purchased this item about 1 month ago, but still didn't receive it.I guess that I used my old address. It could be my mistake, not GizmosForLife's, but I didn't know it from when I ordered until 2 weeks ago. I used Amazon book purchase several times, but don't know why I did this mistake.Recently, I have tried to contact the resident at that address.I went there 2 times and sent a letter, but nothing happened.Maybe, that apartment is empty now."
1,Lousy if you want to write your own resume,"I wanted a program that would handle all the formatting (MS Word is such a pain) and let me do the writing. This is NOT the program for someone like me. This program is designed to write all the words in your resume--it has a data bank of hundreds of jobs and job descriptions for each of these. I suppose if you're totally incapable of writing your own resume, this program would be good. But if you've gone as far as reading reviews on Amazon, you're probably capable of writing your own resume and should avoid this program. Even if you DO want a program to write the resume, this program is way too complicated and kludgey to be good. It's really hard to work with."
4,Got the Creative Juices Flowing,"I found this software unopened and unused for $6 at a local Goodwill.I've never been one to have a hard time with creative writing yet when writing my resume I seemed to always run into writer's block. Using some the features included in this software I found the ideas flowing and was able to re-word some of my most mundane job duties to make me sound like a superstar. I also enjoyed the numerous resume formats included.Comprehensive, easy-to-use. Pair this with a few resume books and get inspired!"
1,Terrible Product,There really is no way that I can even give this product a single star. It is TERRIBLE. The program is very restrictive and doesn't seem to consider many variations to a basic style. There were virtually no options for us to create an academic resume. The styles all looked horribly unprofessional. I would be embarrassed to send out a resume produced by this program. You can do much better using Word by yourself.
4,IT WAS WONDERFUL,"If you want your child to have an independent non=conforming attitude I suggest these materials!! Free to be....you and Me, ALSO VERY GOOD! Get them and your kids will enjoy them VERY MUCH!!!"
1,Knorrs Meat Seasoning,"Very disappointed. This was not the product I ordered, they told me they don't make this anymore but a new one for grilling is the same thing, it was not. The price of a small container was $29.99 (extremely expensive). Would never order this again. A ripoff."
5,Love this seasoning and love Leaving Home cookbook!,I've used this seasoning and LuLu Grace's Leaving Home cookbook for over 20 years -- both are the best!
3,Good exercise equipment?,"I have this rake with the aluminum handle from Wolf-Garten. Like all of their products (and I have quite a few) it is of exceptional quality. However this combination is somewhat tiring to use because of it's combined weight. My old cheapo metal tine rake with wooden handle from a big box home improvement store was much better (though the rivets wore out after a few years of use). Plus the tines are not as stiff on the cheapo rake which makes it more effective at separating or ""flicking"" the leaves from the grass and especially from ground cover. And it is wider yet much lighter. If I had my time back I would have just replaced my old rake. Maybe the wooden handle from Wolf-Garten is lighter but I don't feel like throwing good money after bad."
1,Does not grab the leaves,I was fuelled to think that all made by Wolf Garten is good. This rake does not grab leaves and space between spikes quite wide. It is useless in my backyard.
5,WOLF-Garten 3535004 Garden Rake,I bought this rake for my gardener as a gift. I also bought attachments and I know he will love it. They are all sturdy and well made tools.
1,Shade fabric disentegrates and flakes into your hair and food,"I loved this fabric initially. However after one summer, this particular fabric (tan colored) starts to flake and these flakes land in your hair and your food and drink. They are all over the place. I haven't noticed this with any other color, just tan. I am going to bite the bullet and try the green or blue color and hope it doesn't flake. So gross. I live in the hottest desert in Arizona so that may also have a factor."
4,Coolaroo shade cloth,Does a fine job of partially screening direct sun without creating shade or reducing light too much. Clips available online for less than $10 plus shipping mounted on rope are the best way to mount the cloth on our overhead deck-mounted pergola.
3,shade not outdoor furniture fabric,I have been looking for replacement outdoor furniture fabric. The kind that feels a little like plastic and is heavy duty. This fabric is definitely for awnings or pergolas not furniture.
3,"Provides the shade needed for garden in AZ, but","The grommets ate right through the fabric. Using grommets on this material is useless, as they rip right through the material to the products hem. How long the hem will hold the grommets on is the question. I even reinforce the fabric with other material to try and stop the ripping. I have a bad feeling this will not stand up to the desert wind.If I needed this fabric to cover more then my tomatoes, I would be upset at how frail the fabric really is. I would never use it as a decorative shade, I would buy a higher quality shade material.It does provide the proper sun protection for the tomatoes though. I purchased the 70% UV Block fabric."
5,Bam! Take that you nasty blinding sun,"I have the use of a sunroom back again thanks to this product. It has made a huge difference, but still allows the air to flow and I have the ability to watch the birds and butterflies. Here's how I put it to use: I bought cheap cafe clips (the little rings with clasps). Then I put up a length of vinyl clothesline and secured it with long screws at various spaces. The clips were on the line and I pulled up the cloth in sections and clamped it in place. I added two clips to the bottom and attached those in place to keep it from flying up with the breeze and slapping me in the face. The ambiance in the room is like a soft green cloud - cooler and comfortable enough to sit out there as the sun sets - something that was impossible before. I dream of having a tarp of this stuff on poles over the whole house, but that's just a dream for now. Can you imagine what it would do to lowering AC electric bills? Sigh."
2,CURLING PROBLEM,"I tried to save money by making my own 8' shades. Bought the Coolaroo clips and attached them to a strong wire my husband put up. They will not hang straight,(Probably because the fabric's bias is off). The edges are in a constant curl. I bought more clips, added them to the sides and tied them to the post. In between the clips the edges still curl. UGH! I gave two stars because the Coolaroo does make the porch cooler. If you plan on tacking the fabric down permanently and pull it tight you should be ok."
3,shade,"its a little lighter than the picture but otherwise is as featured. after 1/2 season, product is still in good shape."
3,Not really what I was looking for,I t was not really what I was looking for but it sounded like it was. I guess that is why I don't normally buy things like this or clothing that I cannot feel and see. It is okay and will do what I want it to do somewhat. I think I could have gotten the same product at Lowes or Home Depot for about the same price though. I had looked at their product and this is quite similar if not identical. So if you need it quick go there instead.
3,Shade fabric,"Purchased to block sun on patio on Mexican home. It is really great for blocking the sun so really cuts solar heat shining in. Other reviews said it let air through but we found it blocks all the breeze which is why I gave it 3 stars. It is guaranteed for 10 years but have only had it a month so will see how it stands up to sun, high heat and salt air. May purchase more to build carport."
3,Coolaroo Shades,"The shades live up to their billing as excellent sun blockers but the are a little difficult to roll up evenly and usually look lopsided in the rolled up position Even when I get the roll up tight, the opposite side of the line does not hold the shade evenly. Thought I ordered shades with a clutch and would definitely recomment those."
5,working good so far...,good quality... holding up good so far. will update later if anything happens. i want more of this but at a cheaper price. i'm glad i bought it when i did.
3,Don't believe the picture!,"This was a great deal and it DID come with a lot of great games, BUT it didn't come with the balls for the darts games that are shown in the picture. I had sent an email explaining the situation and was sent an ENTIRE new package but again no balls. I finally gave up but am disappointed that the company didn't handle the situation better.Also, don't inflate the basketballs too much or they won't fit in the net."
5,Great Shower Gift!,"I received this cookbook as a shower gift and I have been referring to it ever since! I am admittedly a beginner in the kitchen and this cookbook lays everything out so well. It has wonderful tips and every recipe I've tried from it so far has been great. I especially love the section on slow cooking, although, I wish it were a bit bigger. It also includes several vegetarian options and a section entertaining. I have five or six other cookbooks, but this one is my new go-to cookbook!"
4,"Nice book, but needs improvements.","This is a nice cookbook, but could use some improvements. I have made a few recipes from it already and they have turned out great. However, it is difficult to follow a recipe when the book keeps closing on you. This book really needs to be spiral bound. It has a ribbon page marker, but the darn thing keeps slamming shut. Its not wide enough to place a jar or something on it and its too heavy to hold something else. I tried putting a binder clip on the pages, but its just to heavy to hold it. It also needs to have a waterproof cover, something you can wipe clean instead of the paper dust cover that it currently has. Cookbooks can get abused and they need to have a tougher exterior."
3,Cookbook for a bride,"I bought this cookbook for a bride to be.. It had a permanant green marker on the bookmarker.. Well, I kept this one and bought the bride to be a new one.. Not really happy with it.."
5,Get one,"I've finally found a really good silicone spatula. This spatula is good for cooking, rather than bowl scraping. I bought this as a gift for a friend and I was able to use it for a couple of weeks while I was a houseguest. I will be ordering one for myself soon."
2,strong but unreliable,this protection is solid but not reliable.Construction is strong but the closure system is not reliable ...it happened to me several times to see my HTC fly out of this box.the solution I found is a closure with scotch tape ...Another problem is that this box reduces the reception of network .
5,When Living Hurts,"I found When Living Hurts very helpful, easy to read, laced with humor and thoughtful areas. I recommend it highly."
5,Proform 66780 Valve Lash Wrench Set,"Proform 66780 Valve Lash Wrench SetThis is a great little tool to have in my box. When I have to adjust lifters with the engine in the vehicle this is like having three hands. Between having a bump switch under the hood to turn the engine over and this great tool adjusting lifters is easier than ever. I've taken a few pictures to share and also called Proform to find out this set (66780) is for 9/16"" Poly-Lock nuts. Make sure you are buying the correct size they make 4 different size wrench sets.Buy this tool with confidence.RagenRat"
1,Find another remote,"I had little choice in which replacement remote to purchase. I ended up buying the RCA 4-device. There are major issues. First, programing the remote to the TV was a mini-nightmare in itself. But then you think, ok that will only happen once. True. However, if you hit menu, for instance, you will need to reprogram the remote. Why? Who knows. Then (and no I am not exaggerating) if you breathe on the on/off button it will activate the trigger function. Seriously, seriously annoying. Not recommended AT ALL."
3,The Doors : From the Outside DVD,"Overall the story was interesting and input from people who ordinarily aren't too familiar to Doors fans. The only dislike was from this so called Mrs. Morrison, in her mind. Iv'e read the book by her, Strange Days, was not impressed, and most of what she has to say is difficult to believe. So, other than Patrica Kennealy, the Dvd was enjoyable and many people not familiar with The Doors would find it interesting. Hardcore Doors fans maybe not as much."
3,Eh.,"It's an alright ocarina, but it does have many tuning issues. Would save my money and purchase a better one in the future."
4,it sounds great,"i like playing it when i play it the notes it plays are well sounding, but i think it is too big to be around the neck... that is all"
5,well written and concise,"A well written assessment of EIA. Mr. Sadler looks at the difference between academics writing and talking about what ""should"" happen and what is actually feasible in a market capitalistic society."
3,fabulous sound except for the voice,"This is a true audiophile recording. The musicianship and audio quality is outstanding. Listen to this baby on headphones and enjoy. My issue is with Mr. Macleod's voice, which, although bluesy, does not really carry a tune very well. I feel bad saying this, but that is my opinion, and that is what keeps me from listening to this very often."
3,"Super Sound, So-So Perfomance","Right off the bat I must point out that the recording quality on this release (my copy was a JVC XRCD release) is truly excellent, with a natural timbre and realistic dynamics that will make you glad you have assembled a top-notch stereo. Musically, this is a nice set of acoustic blues, maybe nothing to get excited about, but certainly enjoyable. Had Ted Hawkins been recorded this well, his disk would be worth crawling across the desert for on your hand and knees. If you are a fan of acoustic blues and you like to show off your system, then by all means you should get to your local record or audio store to pick up this disk by Doug McLeod--but I wouldn't recommend crossing the desert for it, even in a Cadillac."
2,I regret not picking up this album.,"Hedder formally Aunt Flossie, made an appearance in my conservative little city and I think they suprised a few people. After seeing them live I concluded that they were too heavy for this town and for my taste but after hearing the tracks For You, For Me and Save Your Face getting airplay I realized that the album isn't as heavy as the band's gimmick. Overall, they are a solid rock metal band and their album is worth picking up for you metal fans. Very catchy sound. Damn nice guys, my crew and I had a damn good time talking music and downing beers with these guys. Linkin Park meets Foo Fighters. I regret not paying the [money] at the show and now I have to pay record store prices."
2,money better spent,"I really applaud Frank McNamara for attempting this, since I think he is one of our best composers/conductors. However, if you want to spend your hard earned cash, I would use it on the Frank's former colleagues, the Irish Tenors. In particular, I think Anthony Kearns has emerged as possibly the finest tenor voice in the world today. As a big fan of American Musical theater as well as a regular at the opera, I think he could emerge as a superstar.Time (and his interests) will tell."
2,Not Worthy,"I'm ashamed of the opera world today, for the fact that they can allow such inferior voices like Andrea Bocelli, Josh Groban and now these 3 ""American Tenors"" to upstage the real stars and bring what most people think is superior singing to the most ears. I want to bring to light that none of these 3 guys made it past the semi-final round of the Met Auditions. For all of you who think that these new guys must be the three best tenors in America, think again. I don't want to flame those who have written reviews before me, but potential buyers of this CD should be warned that there are soooo many other discs available which contain the best and most beautiful tenor singing of all time. On this very website, search for names like Bjorling, Corelli, Bergonzi, and of course Carreras, Domingo and Pavarotti. Once you've listened to those, then you'll understand what I'm talking about."
3,Good Overall,"I enjoyed the presentation, and I enjoyed Natan Granner the most. He has a strong clear voice that deals with this material well. Daniel Montenegro is also strong, but Mauricio O'Reilly's voice comes across as thin and not very powerful. He would do better with softer, more intimate songs, with fewer instruments as accompanyment.Nevertheless, I enjoyed this DVD and would recommend it."
2,"Big book, bad code, little help","This is a relatively large book and one would expect it to have a lot of material inside. Suprisingly, it does not.JSTL is described at length but the more you delve into the book you find that you are not learning much and that examples are not really applicable. Another qualm with this book is that its examples contain really bad HTML code - and I know, we are dealing with JSPs and JSTL, but if you are an author, correct HTML will not hurt.There are other books available on the topic - get one of them (stay away from JSTL: Practical Guide which is even worse than this book)."
4,A view from two wars later by a Viet Nam navy veteran,"The technical accuracy of the author made this compelling reading for those of us who have served aboard warships and know the lexicon, routines and emotions experienced. Although a generation later many technical and technological changes had taken place for me, this book deftly shows that shipboard loyalties, fears and friendships remain the same for all shipmates. The book also helped those of us who came back to once again remember and appreciate the sacrifice of those who didn't."
5,Touching. A story to remember.,"Bring a box of tissues, else read through your tears, because you won't put it down. Beautifully done. An easy read about the hopes, and dreams of a young man in a very challenging time and his struggle to right the apple cart."
4,True history of the Papacy,This book is an excellent presentation of the true history of the Papacy. People will do well to study read this to have an accurate understanding of the nature of the Papacy and the Vatican.-Signs Of The Times-
1,Doesn't the devil divide?,"Jesus left us an undiveded church, a church without denominations. Martin Luther was right when he said that his followers would give a harder strike against the gospel than the papacy. The protestant version of the church, one divided in self contradictory pieces doesn't give me the testimony that protestants are THE church of God. Billy Graham said that John Paul II was a man of God. The Antichrist?. Well, the pope haters haven't managed to make THE EVANGELICAL CHURCH a reality, and I mean one without denominations, which are human inventions and for that reason unbiblical. Jesus acts thru them because of His Love, not because of their orthodoxy, which is very damaged."
1,Amateur hour.,"I see you have 3 reviews written by 3 band members. How about an opinion from someone who isn't in the band or one of their friends or moms?STG is an amateur sounding mess. There is no other way to describe this. It's simply terrible. Poor production, no songs, juvenile lyrics etc. Don't waste your time. I thought this record sucked so bad, I started an account just to review it!"
3,Good Story But A Bit Disturbing,"Good story. Great illustrations. The two parts I don't like are: (1) One of the things she tells the bunny is that she drank a lot of black coffee. So the bunny drinks so much that he can't sleep and ""spent the whole night going to the bathroom"". The illustration shows him sitting on a kitchen counter looking miserable in a big puddle of pee. (2) Another thing she tells the bunny is that she ate lots of blackberries. So the bunny ate until he was so full he couldn't move, his belly hurt, and he ""spent the whole night going to the bathroom"". The illustration shows him laying in the street market where he bought the basket of berries with a scattering of bunny poo all around him."
5,Mayo heaven,This cookbook is one I have used forever and wanted my daughters to have. The seller was prompt and the book in perfect condition. I was thrilled with my purchase and so were my daughters.
2,Original? Uh-uh.,"I listen to this band and want to slip on some old Swans for real music! This band frightening? A nu-metal listening wimp, would think so. Personally this sounds like Swans with training wheels on. Get Cop or Filth Public Castration Is A good Idea for the REAL brutal dark and beautiful music. Acid Bath is more like Acid Re-flux."
5,GREAT!,"This is better than Pagean Terrorism Tacticts by far. I just wish they were still together... Oh Well! This is an awesome cd. The best tracks are The Blue, Tranquilized, Cheap Vodka, Finger Paintings Of The Insane, Jezebel, What Color Is Death, And Cassie Eats Cockraoches."
5,best cd,"This is my personal favorite acid bath cd. From the first song I heard (scream of the butterfly) i was hooked. I have had this cd since it came out and I listen to it every day. Definatly a cd that will get lots of use for you true metal fans. Scream of the butterfly is by far my favorite song on this cd and is most of my friends favorite. IF you like this one try the other cd, but i think this one is the best"
5,Nothing less than a masterpiece,"Very few artists move me as much as this band. I know there are aspects of this kind of music that some people will never be able to get passed; what a shame. The rhythms, melodies and bluesy/alarming vocals reach deep into the soul. This is a truly original mix of many types of music. Do yourself and Acid Bath a favor and buy this record. Open your mind, turn off the lights and get ready to be pulled in. It's that powerful."
5,Untouchable,"This cd is perfection. There is no other way to describe it. The lyrics are insightful, moody, twisted and sometimes downright deranged. The poetry and construction of the lyrics is something that should be framed in a gallery. All the songs on this cd are fantastic, my favorites are ""Tranquilized"", ""Scream of the Butterfly"", ""Jezebel"", ""God Machine"", ""What Color is Death"", and ""Bones of Baby Dolls"". Buy this cd now. NOW. You will never regret it, one of the soundest investments ever.Sedated and lazy, cold skys full of blue....."
5,One of the most over looked albums ever,"I just got this cd and I cant beleive how outstanding it is. This one just jumped into my top five of all time. I own a lot of metal cd's and these guy's should have been just as big as tool,slipknot, mudvayne and even metallica. If you don't by this album, take everything you own and throw it away because you are just fooling yourself."
5,not enough stars...,"i've been listening to acidbath since i was 12 years old(17 now)and this cd has so much meaning to me. dax riggs is the most talented artist around these days(or ever)his voice is insanely evil one second,then hauntingly soothing the next. sammy duets satanic screams and riffs settle the grave.if you don't own this album(or anything by dax)you don't know what you're missing."
5,"if you don't listen to this, you're not metal","all that needs to be said, is that this is possibly the best album ever recorded"
5,Best book ever - get more than one copy,"You must have this book. My kids can't read yet, but they love this book. I love it too since the art work is so great and it is fun to find the mice, puppy, cat, butterfly, and spider on each page. The artwork and ""cutouts"" for the dog and cat are well layed out. Lisa McCue works in her initials too on various items like a window sash and book binding as well as a copy of the book in the attic scene. I never get tired of looking at this book as a parent."
5,Highly Inspirational,"As a visual artist and actor I don't know a great deal about the construction of music, but I do look to it as a constant source of inspiration in my life and for my work. ""Free Spirit"" has been that inspiration for me on many occasions. It's contrasting moods have helped me create over a half a dozen pieces. In some ways I consider it the catalyst in my artistic focus. ""Four Moments For Piano"" has remained my favorite piece since I've owned the cd. It creates a relaxing and romantic atmosphere that I've come to look forward to at the end of a day. Others that I know who own this cd have used it in dance recitals and as background music in independent film projects. So it serves, not only as a source for the creation of visual art, but in that of movement and multimedia as well."
1,Batteries I received failed the charge test,"The 3 batteries I received seemed to last only a short time before they had to be recharged and when I had them tested, they failed the charge test. Wasted my time and money."
4,Fit for purpose at low cost,This security system backup battery arrived on time and well packaged. Product looks well made and once installed worked like a charm. Only problem was terminal leads needed to be cut down to fit existing security system.
1,ENERSYS -DIE HARD PLATINUM -BATTERY BLEW UP-SKIN BURN-SERVERE,"Purchased a battery- Sears Die Hard Platinum -Enersys,is the maker of this product,the battery was defective.What happened,one summer day after my car had started heard a strange noise coming from under hood,when I open the hood look near battery acid shoot out around the seams of the battery going every where body face engine etc. contacted sears directed me to the maker of the defective battery Enersys,they did ABSOLUTELY NOITHING, even had the nerve to say it was my fault,I had severe burns on face and arm engine electrical system,they treated this as it was noithing ,they had a WE TO NOT CARE ATTITUDE, I was told this is not the first time this has happen to a Enersys Die Hard Battery (One They Make)PLEASE BE CAREFUL-Would Not Like Anyone To Go Though What I Did- ENERSYS IS NOT A GOOD COMPANY (MANUFACTORY OF BATTERY)--SEARS DIE HARD ETC-SERVERE INJURY"
4,NP7-12 versus NP7-12T,"T-BONE! Check your old battery. I'll just bet that it is an NP7-12, and you ordered an NP7-12T. Let me know. Thanks."
5,Fantastic Read - Great Beach Book,"This is a great, hilarious read. Forget trashy, slushy romance, this is a comedy romp with some love interest on the side. Horror stories have more sex and romance than this book! The heroine is a great character with some snappy asides and life observations. I'm not a romatic novel reader normally, but I have to confess that I used to work with the author's husband and I always promised to read her work. Well he left the firm I work at, and then I happened across the book (wish I'd got his wife to autograph it - she feels like a rising star) and having just finished my latest stack decided to give it a whirl. What a pleasant surprise. I couldn't put the book down. This is really great beach book material. The plot is hilarious, the characters are a hoot and in all you kind of feel you're at an old time musical hall. Read it. I promise you won't regret it."
3,Critical Thinking,"This book was as expected, not perfect condition but very well kept, just as advertised"
2,A nature film with NO NATURE SOUNDS,"Spectacular waterfalls. Although, part of the enjoyment of viewing a beautiful waterfall is also hearing the sound of the water. The harmony of both the visual and audio creates the tranquility that gives one a sense of peace and serenity. I assume that would be the intent of those who desire to watch a DVD like this.Instead of sounds of nature, water cascading, flowing, splashing or bubbling... you are given piano music. It actually became distracting and I had to mute the sound. I would have much preferred the natural sounds of the environment. Even wild birds would have been better.I also would have liked to know the names and location of these worldwide waterfalls. A simple notation would have been nice."
5,Dream On,"This quilt book I call my dream book. I sit and dream that I will make each quilt. In the fabric shops I find myself selecting the perfect fabric for one of the quilts. Oh that I could make each one. Dream on I say. Then Iselct fabric, cut it and with passion pursue the completion of the quilt--to give away. Quilts from the Quilmaker's Gift is a book for beginners,seasoned quilters, or a quilter who can no longer quilt but can dream by looking."
1,Too many errors,"I am a beginner quilter and found too many mistakes in this book. I found myself having to drive back into town for more material due to errors in the book. Example: Puss in the Corner asks you to cut 120 blocks of fabric A, (for a twin size) but you really need 135 blocks. The yardage to purchase is for the 120 blocks not the 135. The rest of the instructions for this quilt is incorrect. Come to find out, you need to go to a web site before you start a quilt in this book for all the corrections. Too much of a hassel. Not a good beginner book."
2,uhh.. this thing was poorly made.,"Yeah, it's nice and soft. Very flexible, the vibrator didnt work very well. She liked how it felt inside her but the detail was less than expected. It's uglier than most penii normally are. It's pretty girthy, very girthy. It'll take some warming up to say the least. Use plenty of water-based lube and go slow. Make sure you get either some good anti-bacterial mild soap or get some good toy cleaner for this guy. Clean it after every use. If you can, toss a condom on it as well. Id suggest the Mr Marcus cock and balls rather than buying this one."
2,Some Like It Not So Hot,"Note by note renditions on this recording of some of Palmer's best work are impressive, but ultimately you might as well have the original studio versions. If this is a recent concert, then it's especially disappointing because all of the 80's synth sounds are reproduced on these versions and they sound horribly dated. Some reinterpretations of Palmer's back catalog would have been welcome. It's not a bad album...just an unncessary one."
1,"Love MegaDeth, Hate this remix","Sounds like crap muddy and muffeled. The worst part , one of the best songs , these boots is bleeped out.. for legal reasons Dave censored it..It runied the whole thing. I do not reccomend it. Get Youthanasia it kicks ass. I am a huge fan have been since the begining in Calif back in the day.. I bought this when it came out on a cassette in the late 80's and loved it.. really a shame."
2,For hardcore fans only,"This is a crude album, which is not really much of a criticism when one considers the state of Metal at that time. Still, it pales in comparison to ""Kill 'em All,"" the album Dave would have played on if he hadn't been fired from Metallica. Only the hardcore fan should bother with this album; ""Peace Sells,"" their next recording, was light-years better."
3,Why ????? These boots,"I have just bought this cd and it was just perfect until ""These Boots"", and i cant belive, there is almost not lirics because of the bipshas dave listened this cd ?luck for me I have the original"
1,Explicit lyrics....?,"This was a BIG disappointment. I have the cassette version and I have been trying to locate a CD for a very long time so I can have it for my collection. I was GREATLY disappointed when my favorite song ""These Boots"" was almost in its entirety ""beeped"" out. I certainly did NOT receive the CD which is advertised on Amazon's website, ""Parental Advisory"" and ""Explicit Lyrics"". And lastly, certainly not the ""Original Record Completely Remixed"". This is a very misrepresented product and ruined the originality of the music."
4,Not a bad start,"At first I thought this album was a little mediocre. As I started to listen to it more and more I felt like it was really good. It's a good thrash album to have. However, there are better ones. This is like their Kill'em All. Nonetheless, Megadeth get only better and better. This album helps to lay down the foundations for later albums. I'd recommend getting this album if you consider yourself a Megadeth fan."
1,These Boots real BAD! Dont BUY,"I just have to say: The bleep in These Boots, MAKES ME SO ANGRY!!! I should've read the reviews before my buy!!!"
3,METAL,"this is a good metal album,not as good as other megadeth records but you can definitely see the potential there,i would recommend this to any metal fan"
3,Really....,"So, I bought this about a week ago. It took longer then normal to recive, When It DID arrive, It was in a cheap paper bag with bubble wrap. Jewel Case was cracked across the entire case, and slight rip in the cover album photo. The CD is the only thing that was not damaged"
2,Not to good,"This album is the firt ever done by Megadeth but remasterd. (I have the old one) but I think I can revie it.The album is more a collector thing it's not the record you would put and listen to beacuse you think it's good. The producing has made it sound cheap and bad, you can almost not hear the singing and the sound is very raw.Even tho ther are some good bits and Killing is my bui... are quiet okay but I would not recomend it for a new fan."
2,megadeth=metallica?,i think megadeth are is big as they are cause dave mustaine was metallica which ment they woulod have fans + metallica fans so lucky f?@ks
2,Talentless waste of space,"This is a band that says it has talent simply because it can make a lot of noise. A monkey can learn to pull strings on a piece of plastic, or hit cans with two sticks. This band just throws together the same old vocals with a little different variation everytime.Just because they have been playing for a long time does not make them good. Emotion is where true talent lies, this band is just a shadow consisting of men who cant do anything beyond their pathedic band so they capitalize on people who liked their previous work. They have no emotion and are poor because of it.I would give them one star, but there is one nice riff on the album, nothing special but its a nice ten seconds compared to the rest of the cd."
1,Panzy Division,"I know all you Megadeth fans instantly hate me. Good. I always get the feeling most of you would rather give Dave Mustaine a hand job rather than listen to good metal.The production is still god-awfull. Dave's vocals are the annoying and pointless. Um...hello! Megadeth isn't good thrash people! I've heard every album and one work always comes to mind, panzy.Well, now that it's out of my system I feel much better. It's always nice to comment on bands that lack anything cool. You people have a nice day."
4,killing is my business remastered,"The only reason why i didnt give this remastered cd 5 stars is becausemost of the words that dave put into the ""these boots remake""have been bleeped out via the original writer.I loved megadeth's version of these boots but LEE HAZELWOOD afteryears of collecting proceeds from the remake decided it was nowoffensive and vile.......JERK!Any how the cd is great.Dave and the guys have given us some bonusmaterial which is demo versions of LAST RIGHTS, MECHANIX and THE SKULLBENEATH THE SKIN.It is great hearing these song's from the original cd remastered.The production is great.I really enjoyed the written story lines that Dave and the boysincluded in the sleeve.If you are a megadeth fan there is a lot of written informationin these story lines that we wouldn't have known otherwise."
5,Old school thrash metal!,"The thrashiest Megadeth album of all! Great album except for the cover of ""These Boots"" that has half the lyrics censored by an awful beep! The remastered versions of all the songs sound way better then on the original release and are well worth the money! Bang your f#*kin' head!!"
2,You call this a remaster!?,"I don't see what everyone sees in this re-release. First of all, the album was never that good to begin with. For the most part the whole album is generic thrash. Only Last Rites/Loved To Death and Mechanix stand out. Having demos of them WAS a good idea. Like so many others, I sure as [heck] wasn't pleased with the Emergency Broadcast System Remix of These Boots. AT LEAST HALF THE SONG IS BLEEPED, AND THE WORDS AREN'T EVEN BAD! And those early demo tracks? A good idea, BUT THE SOUND IS TERRIBLE! Aren't remasters supposed to REPAIR the quality of classic albums? And then there is the cover. It now looks like any ""new metal"" cover, complete with Parental Advisory logo. I don't see how anyone can like this album any more than Metallica's Kill 'em All. Early Megadeth was never too good, and here it shows, with poor songs and poor production quality. Someone call me when they put out a REAL remaster of this album. ..."
3,The only Megadeth remix I'd buy...,"Credit must be given to Dave Mustaine for wanting this headbanging record to sound good. The sound is loud and crunchy and the drums are absolutely ear-kicking... The removal of the reverb gives the album a completely different ambiance (the process was not as successful on ""So Far, So Good...""). The new cover is actually quite interesting even if it doesn't freak me out as much as the original.Now to the bad part... I know it's been said before, but this reissue is completely ruined by the BEEEEEPs on ""These Boots"".I'd recomend both versions of this album. For the original one look for the edition with ""These Boots"" UNCENSORED. It's definitely a must get."
1,AMAZON COPY IS EDITED!!,"I ordered this from Amazon since the original copy I had did not have the bonus tracks. The song ""These Boots"" is filled with that goddamned bleep every other line. When I buy music, I do not want anyone to tell me I have to listen to it in a way that was different from the musician's original music. If you want censored, get this, If not, spend the few extra dollars at BestBuy."
2,Killing is blipping business,"I have this album on tape and was ecstatic when the rendition of ""these boots"" was re-added to the cd, since it had been removed form the original. I almost puked when I heard every cuss word had been blipped out with a really annoying beep sound. The original remake of the old tune was great but, that blipping in the new cut sounds like junk! I don't have to have cuss words but, that blipping was like exasperating nails being driven into my head!"
3,Ruined remix...,"This was one of Megadeth's better albums, so it still ranks a 3, but it's disappointing that Mustaine saw the need rerecord (not just remix his vocals). I agree that the mixes for this and ""Peace Sells"" were pretty muddy, but the vocals were far better in the original mixes. In the remix of ""Last Rites/Loved to Death"" it sounds like they left the original vocal track and Mustaine tried to sing over it - the thing is, he's not even in sync with himself. Truly odd..."
5,Heavy As Hell,"Megadeth has never had a more thrashy album than this. Its a great album. I think its great for new fans of the band. Dave and Junior did a great job on remastering the album. It sounds awesome! This has to be Megadeths heaviest album, along with So Far, So Good.... A great debut from a great band."
4,Very nice,"This cd is amazing. Everything from the remastered songs to the demos in the end. The only thing I disliked are the bleep sounds in ""These boots"". Those wouldn't have been there if Hazelwood had let Dave use his lyrics on it. But besides that, it's a very cool debut album"
1,poor quality,This product arrived broken. It appeared to be made of weak material and would not last along outside. The clock did not match the picture and had temperature in F.
2,I thought I knew Thrash history well...until this...,"I was expecting a few good metal covers glancing at the cover when i bought it. Instead I get hard house remixes ...it is truely blasphemy what these people have done! Do not waste your money. Who ever put this album together doesn't even know the difference between the bands and song titles...spot the mistakes on back cover. They obviously have no clue about thrash metal. Only one or two chunky tunes. Why Anthrax would put their name to this I dont know. No wonder the guy in the shop smiled at me when I bought it, I will be using it as a coffee mat!"
2,Strangers In 7A,"I LOVE Andy Griffith and am trying to watch everything he was in. Face In The Crowd was an incredible movie and probably his best acting job. No Time For Sergeants was funny and Andy did an excellent job as a country bumpkin. Of course, he was superb in The Andy Griffith Show. Now, to Strangers In 7A. Terrible movie. Cheaply made and the dialogue was awful. Andy was ok in it and I'm glad I was able to watch it, but I really can't recommend it unless you're a diehard Griffith fan. Ida Lapino was very good."
3,strange,"I was most uncomfortable watching Andy hot under the collar for a young woman. While the film is quite good, it was like watching your local priest coming onto a young woman. I just cant think of andy griffith that way"
3,Not factual,"There was no ""Children's Crusade."" The event was recorded by monks and scribes, but the word used to describe the people was ""puer"" which in Latin means boy, or sometimes in the plural it means ""children."" The term was meant to be demeaning in nature, not literal, because those that were involved in the march (which supposedly did happen) were poor peasants. So there probably was such a march, but they were not children. Anyway, I haven't read but the book, but I'm sure it's riveting. ;)"
3,Not bad for the money,"I've had this for two months. Operates okay. Several small things like the recessed spindle head and noise are annoying but workable. The tool rest holder does not come out from the bed anywhere near the capacity of the lathe. The belt is already fraying, probably due to the variable speed pulleys. All in all, for my first lathe, it is a good value. I see a Delta or Jet inverter type in the future as my skills improve, but they are almost 3X the cost. Stay away from the Grizzly accessories. The scrow chuck wobbled very badly and even the faceplate that came with it has runout."
2,Not so good,Several problems:Spindle was recessed within headstock (should protrude) so that you can thread on jaws. Had to find a washer with i.d. big enough to fit over spindle but o.d. small enough to fit within headstock and yet thick enough to protrude outside of headstock to allow jaws to tighten against spindle.The variable speed head doesn't work very well. Had to have an entire headstock mailed to me. It was inoperable as well. Ended up banging the origiinal free. Operates marginally well.Wouldn't recommend this product.
3,Overall Satisfied,"I have had this lathe since about 1988 and use it lightly. The lathe has always had a lot of vibrations but didn't affect the turning; it primarily caused the cabined door to rattle loudly. The door latch is also been giving me trouble the last year or so by being very difficult to push the unlatch button. The guard was broken soon after purchase by my table saw kicking back my push stick; admittedly it was a lot of force since it severely bruised my hand and forearm before breaking the guard. The tail head assembly is now creating a grinding feeling and increased resistance when tightening the stock between the centers. The only other problem I have had with the machine is I'm sure due to lack of maintenance since purchase, the variable speed mechanism stuck in place about in about 2004 resulting in having to force apart the components, clean and lubricate. The variable speed mechanism has worked just fine since then."
3,3 stars for 3 songs,"I give three stars for only three listenable songs, Voyageur, Boum Boum, Page of Cups.........."
3,Something different,"I have to admit that it took me several listens before I actually liked this CD. At first I was disappointed, there seemed to be lacking any of the ""special hooks"" that the previous albums possessed. But, then I realized that this may be the hook of this album. It is much more club friendly than the other albums. I can almost hear ""Boum Boum"" and ""The Look of Today"" being played in the clubs (just add some club bass beats and some techno flourishes). As I listen more carefully to the rest of the album, I realize that there are still some interesting sounds and lyrics.I am willing to go on the ride with Enigma...change is good."
3,"INCOGNITO ROCKS,THE REST IS REFINED","I LIKE ALL OF ENIGMA'S MUSIC AND ARE WILLING TO BYE ALL THERE CD'S,BUT THIS ALBUM TO ME SEEMED TO BE MORE CALMER AND SUBDUED THEN SOME OF THERE OTHERS.BUT STILL VERY GOOD.MY FAVORITE SONG IS INCOGNITO IT ROCKS AND IT SOUND LIKE A SONG THAT SHOULD BE PUT IN ALOT OF SHOOT AM UP,EXPEANODGE AND OTHER TYPES OF ACTION MOVIES SUCH AS BAD BOYS 2.I PLAYED THIS SONG WILE WATCHING THIS FILM OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND IT WENT EXACTLY WITH EVERY MOVE THAT WAS MADE IN THE MOVIE.MOVIE DIRECTORS SHOULD FIND OUT ABOUT THIS SONG AND PLACE IT IN ALOT OF THERE FILMS,ALONG WITH MANY OTHER ENIGMA MUSIC.GOOD PURCHASE."
1,a disappointment,I love Enigma. This album just droans on and seems like made up of pieces from the cutting floor. I really was disappointed indeed as Engima is Such a Great Group.
2,Shockingly bad album by one of my favorite bands,"Enigma really tried to do something new with Voyageur and, once you've heard all their albums, it's obvious that they figured out how to use the sound they developed in this album more effectively later. If you're not just trying to complete an Enigma collection, I recommend skipping this album in favor of the one that followed it."
2,Very average album,"2003 ""Voyageur"" - that is very, very average album. You can find many of pop albums with similar quality. Whatever factor was making from Enigma a very special project here is almost completely lost. Songs are quite boring, production not excellent and something is obviously missing. Ruth Ann appears here again in 2 songs. I like only one song really: ""In The Shadows In The Light""."
3,not just the music .but even the quality of recording,"People say they have been enigma fan since their debut in 1990.but hey! I have been Michael Cretu's fan since 1986. I loved his album ""Belle Epoch"". It was a blast, still is a blast from the past. I have loved every single Enigma album until this one. It just does not have the true Enigma touch. Even the recording quality was not good, or maybe it was just my CD. Still Enigma is the real thing and much better than ""nigma wannabes""! I am waiting for their next album which hopefully would be a better one. I still love you Enigma !"
2,Bitterly Dissapointed,"After waiting a long, long, long time for another release from Michael Cretu's Enigma, I am bitterly dissapointed. Not only has Enigma turned its back on what made it great, Cretu has totally taken Enigma into the almost unlistenable.I have all Enigma's CD's and listen to the albums frequently, but I will not be listening to Voyageur ever again. There are no notable songs worth listening to. What happened to the Gregorian Chants?Cretu you cannot change the style of Enigma and think that the music will still sound good and the much anticipating fans will love it. In my opinion, Voyageur is not worth buying...I will wait for Enigma 6, and hopefully Cretu will return Enigma to its roots....Love, Sensuality & Devotion."
2,What was he THINKING?,"Before I write this, I must state that I love Enigma dearly. That said, this CD is truly horrible. The only good tracks are ""From East to West"", ""Voyageur"", and ""Page of Cups"". As for the rest of the tracks, Enigma has completely lost their mysterious, ethereal aura in favor of a trashy pop sound. Listen to this album carefully before you buy it!"
1,Totally disappoint,"Michael cretu had no time to produce Enigma, i wrote this only after listend toPOSTERIORI"
2,What happened ? It is not ENIGMATIC anyomore !!!,"I have been listening to ENIGMA since way back in 1990. Coming from a country ( COSTA RICA ) where most people listen to salsa ,merengue and more "" tropical "" rhythms I was certainly one of those few enigma fans. During the last years I have enjoyed all of Mr. Cretu's releases : Le Roi est mort, The Cross of Changes , The Screen Behind the Mirror, etc.. Even the DVD which has that beautiful video of the monk being tempted in SADENESS ( but that is another story, hehe) Going back to the review, I really don't get what or where is Mr. Cretu going with his new project. I can understand artist's constantly ""evolve"" but this VOYAGEUR album leaves me with a bitter taste. Let's see what will happen with the next album. I just hope it has no Boum -Boum elements..."
2,Skip this one...,"I have to admit, I'm stubborn. I liked the first four Enigma CDs so much that I was determined to buy this, despite reading the reviews here that referred to it as directionless and disappointing. So I bought it...and <surprise> it IS disappointing, and not at all what I've come to expect of M. Cretu. I'm not saying Enigma can't have somewhat of a new sound, but this sounds like a compilation of tracks that were never released (for good reason.) Sadly, they WERE released, and most are either forgettable or obnoxious. Almost every track on Enigma's previous albums was of high quality, and I liked almost all of them. In contrast, I like 2 out of 11 tracks on Voyageur, not a good percentage. Buy A Posteriori instead, if you already have the first four albums and are looking for more."
3,Could have been better,"I must say I am glad they are trying new things and not recycling the same chants, etc, but also this record sounds like they found a lot of tape on the floor and decided to make a album. I really like ""From East To West"" (In my mind it is the long awaited extended version/remix of all the intros to the albums.) The problem with this is Michael singing too much. He has a hard to manage voice and seems to be running out of ideas for lyrics (very evident by the lyrics in ""Look of Today"", a total rip-off of ABC's ""Look of Love"".) I think he was great on some of the previous albums with ""The Roundabout"" and ""Modern Crusaders"", but is faltering. Some of the dance beats are great, especially on ""Look Of Today"", ""From East to West"" and ""Voyageur"" but that is it. I gave it a 3 for effort."
5,Wonderful!,"Ok, now I have read all of these reviews and have read all of the reviews on enigmamusic (dot) com and I DISAGREE with all of the negative comments. Grant you, this album is different but hey, who wants to buy the same ole, same ole? I listened tho this SEVERAL times before I posted a review and I must say IT GETS BETTER AS I HEAR IT MORE OFTEN! It is a TERRIBLE shame that this album has not been promoted more. If you are interested in listening to a music cd that will captivate your mind and soul - I recommend this one! For all you out there who say you are true enigma fans - let me be the first one to say that the key is an OPEN MIND. If you don't have that - you won't enjoy the enigma experience. I recomend this CD over and over!"
2,Not Good,I am very Disappionted In this CD. This just is Not Enigma.Don`t Buy This get the greatest hits CD Instead.
1,One of his worst,"Enigma did a stellar debut with MCMXC a.D. and later CD's never could match that debut. This CD is quite bad because Michael Cretu sings on about 80% of the tracks, and singing is not his forte. With track #5 the text is ""my heart goes boom boom boom, every time I think of you"". Is he trying to be a teenage popstar? He is around 40-50 years old by now. I do not recommend this CD."
5,evolution,"I had been a fan, and believe that Enigma has certainly moved the ball of its vision forward with this offering. I bought it for my girlfriend, but subsequently lost girlfriend and forgot disk. I am buying copy 2 now for me. Rest assured I will not be careless enough to lose this copy."
1,Three years in work?!,"This album is such dissatisfaction to me... I love Enigma, I rush to buy Enigma, 5th album is the last one?"
1,what a waste,"i have been a long time enigma fan. i have made it a point to find a way to get all of the import only singles and any special edition albums. then along comes this one, so of course i HAD to have it. it was total crap. i figured maybe i would need to listen to it a few times and i would love it as much as the others, no go. i havent heard anything this bad since i purchased an album michael cretu released under his own name. these two albums are so bad that they are almost interchangable. next time i will make sure to hear the whole album before buying another enigma album, that is if there is a next album after this complete flop."
2,Someone call the police!!!,"Cretu is missing! and some look-a-like has taken his place! This album really sounds like a counterfit. Two stars because the only good tracks are 1 and 11, sort of, ok maybe 10 too. These are the only tracks that come close to what Enigma is or was. Everything in between leaves very much to be desired. The lyrics and synth sound very ameturish. *sigh* I hope he returns soon and recovers from this. I love Enigna, but not this."
1,Lost the Touch,Other than 'The Piano' which is strickly instruemental Voyager is lacking. Entirely too much electronica and vocals that are synthetic sounding. Change prevents artists from becoming stale and there are some good things on the CD. Most of the songs have a good basic rhythm but are ruined with bad vocals. I was very disappointed with this effort and will never buy another Enigma CD unless I listen to if first.
3,I like the old Enigma,I love Enigma I have all the cd's. But I am not crazy about the voyageur cd. The only songs that I love is From East to West and Boum-Boum. I can under stand the change of style and whating to do somethnig diffrent. But enigma was diffrent.Thats why I love it. It was in a class of it's own. But for the old enigma style fans it will be a I like the cd not I love it.I like the cd becuse it's like enigma But I don't love it becuse it ain't enigma. And I always say if it ain't broke don't fix it.
2,"Its like Eminem sings ""Oops I did it again""","I've waited all these years for this? I'm a die-hard Enigma fan and this album is really disappointing. I'm all for change; change for the better, not for the worse. The only track I liked was ""From East To West"". The rest sound either boring or something you hear on a cheesy pop radio station. Nothing interesting in this album at all. Enigma has, or rather had a unique sound; yes I do miss the chants, operas and the samplings. Thats what I expect from Enigma. Listening to the last track ""Follow The Sun"", I thought I was listening to the Dixie Chicks sing. I guess I have to wait another three years for the 6th album to come out to HOPEFULLY get some good ol' Enigma music. Disappointing album unfortunately."
4,Excellent Music That Should Not Be Missed...,"For anyone who has never heard the music of Enigma, the sounds on this album are truly one-of-a-kind when compared to other forms of music--there is simply no way to describe it, much less assign it a label. I would LOVE to meet Michael Cretu (producer and the brains behind Enigma)and try to understand where he comes up with these amazing sounds. I only have one critisizm and it's minor--To my ears, this CD sounds significantly more synthesized and less ""human."" There are fewer tantalizing and unique voices. The music is less thought-provoking and is not as contemplative as most Enigma CDs. Still, I can't get enough of this CD. If you've never heard Enigma, by any CD, take it home, turn out the lights, cover AND close your eyes, and then put on some headphones and let this amazing music take your mind in directions you never imagined..."
2,"Sorry, but don't buy the good reviews","I am an insatiable Enigma fan. This is my favorite group of all time. I bought MXC before it ever hit it big, and I marked on my calendar with excitement for the every three years Enigma puts out a record. I own every album, every remix and every DVD. This album is good, but it is missing all the brilliant layering of the earlier albums. ""The Screen Behind the Mirror"" keeps getting degraded on these reviews but it is a far better album than Voyageur. At least the signature Enigma sound is intact on that album. Cretu has become FAR too in love with his voice on this album and it actually ruins some otherwise good songs. Also, the lyrics are unbelievably cheesy at times. The album will grow on you, but it is still an overall disappointment.PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE GO BACK TO YOUR OLD SOUND ENIGMA! You can still ""explore"" the boundaries of music with your old sound intact."
3,Defective Product,The product was defective because track no 2 in the cd doesn't play properly. I am very disappointed with the quality of the cd.
2,"Excellent production, Bad material","There are only 3 songs that I kinda liked. From East to West, Page of Cups, and Following the Sun. This could have been so much better. I agree with trying a new formula, but this one comes short. It seems as if it was just thrown together compared to previous albums (material wise). However, I was totally impressed with the overall mixing and production. There just seem to be NO more magic left for this cd. Buy it and try it for yourself, you can always sell it if you don't like it."
1,What Happened ?????????,Enigma used to be the proverbial booty music CD and man has this fallen short of expectations! I almost threw it out of my car window. It seems to not have any continuity and it seems to be rejects from past albums. This needs to go back to the drawing board in my opinion---I feel I wasted money! I would recommend a group called Nusound at Neurodisc.com
3,THEY WAS CAN DO IT BETTER...,"YES. IT`S TRUE... IS NOT HIS BEST WORK... BUT IS NOT SO BAD, MAYBE FRIENDS, NEED A FEW MORE TIME TO LISTEN IT BETTER.. GIVE IT A ONE MORE CHANCE.... JUST WAS A RUSH-FASTED PIECE... WE EXPECT SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE ECLECTIC... LIKE ""LE ROI"" OR ""THE SCREEN""...ON HIS NEXT DELIVERY... BE OPTIMISTIC"
2,Too trashy,"I bought this CD yesterday and was pretty disappointed. The songs Voyageur and From East to West are beautiful. The CD would've been good had he let his wife who can actually sing, do more of the vocals. The songs start out lovely, but the second I hear Cretu's voice I cringe. One of the songs on there sounds just like something from N'Sync. To make matters worse the art on the front is burnt into the jewelcase, which of course broke the first time I opened it, so selling it used it not even an option. I'd leave this in the stores and get it off the freeware down the road for a listen, but it is not something to spend money on. I certainly got screwed on this one"
4,This Is Great! Very Easy To Use!,"This product is worth every penny you pay. It imports PowerPoints without flaw. The UI is very pleasing to the eye and gets out of the way. It isn't as feature rich as PowerPoint but it makes up for that with its incredible graphics.All the controls are very intuitive. I would definitely recommend this product to any Mac PowerPoint user, even if you just use it in addtion to PowerPoint."
2,"Sounds good, but don't count on it for CD's!","The speakers sound fantastic and the controls are simple and easy to use. The problem that I had is that in less than a year, it could no longer read CD's very well. It would stop playing them in the middle of a song, or skip to the next song, start the CD over, or just stop completely. It would make a horrible static noise like a record. Don't recommend unless you don't plan to play CD's."
1,Worst Buy.,"My Husband & I bought this about a year ago. We have had nothing but problems with it since. In order for it to even turn on, we have to unplug it, replug, then hope it will work. We lost the receipt, so not able to return it. Has been aweful since it was purchased! Will never buy an RCA product again!!!"
3,Dissapointing,"I was extremely dissapointed when I heard this album. I loved their last to albums, midtown were my fav band. When i first listened to this album i had to check the front cover to make sure it was midtown. Midtown used to be happy and upbeat this is a very depressing album with a lack of singing and to many pianos. There are 3 songs at least with no singing and guitars.Thank God for there last 2 albums but Midtown as we knew it is no more :("
3,"Midtown ""Forget What You Know""","""To Our Saviour"" (7/10)""Give It Up"" (9/10)""Is It Me? Is It True?"" (6/10)""Whole New World"" (7/10)""Empty Like The Ocean"" (7/10)""Nothing Is Ever What It Seems"" (8/10)""Waiting For The News"" (6/10)""Until It Kills"" (7/10)""Help Me Sleep"" (7/10)""Hey Baby, Don't You Know That We're All Whores?"" (7/10)""Manhattan"" (5/10)""So Long As We Keep Our Bodies Numb We're Safe"" (8/10)Midtown's latest record, ""Forget What You Know,"" could be referred to as decent at best. None of the songs are extremely catchy and seem to song very similar. Standouts would be ""Give It Up"" and ""Nothing Is Ever What It Seems.""Overall rating: 7 out of 10."
2,back in the day,"Short and simple. If your into the old Midtown records, then this isn't for you. The high energy, stay young image has faded and a new trend has come in. The change is drastic."
3,Take It Or Leave It,"I will make this short but sweet. This is a good album, great....no. I am a HUGE Midtown fan but this new installment on Columbia/Sony is just too polished. There are good songs on here but they come across sounding more like Bad Religon or Millencolin, so if you like that style (which I do too) then by all means, this album is for you. I just miss their previous sound. But it you are a hardcore Midtown fan then I suggest this album but be open-minded, it is a departure."
2,Oh man,"Well, Living Well is the Best Revenge was and is an awesome CD. I love it, and i have for over 3 years now. I was excited when i heard Midtown had a new CD coming out. So, it came out, i bought it, put it in my CD player. Man, i wasn't very impressed. The first actual song is way too catchy....it's a wonder it wasn't a ""radio hit"" for them. The CD overall was pretty mediocre. A lot of filler and just plain horrible songs. I was able to find 3 that stood out. ""Empty Like the Ocean"", ""Nothing is Ever What it Seems"", ""Help Me Sleep"". Those songs kick some major ass, and for that, i give the CD a 2. I'll be hesitant to buy their next CD."
2,a letdown,"I first heard Midtown after they released Save the world, Lose the Girl. Thought it was pretty good. Then I bought their second release, Living Well Is The Best Revenge. Iloved it. I saw them perform live while promoting the album. I loved their performance. When I heard Midtown had another release, I was excited and I got the CD. I am quite disappointed with it. The album is darker and not near as upbeat as their first 2 releases. The happy poppy punk is nearly gone and this album has a rather rock-like experimental sound. There are just a handful of decent songs on this CD but I wouldn't rate most of them over a 6 on a 1-10 scale. I hadn't heard Giving up, their first single, until I got the album but I think its the only really good song on the whole thing. Overall, I am extremely disappointed with this CD. I don't know much about their dispute with Drive-Thru records, but it must've done something bad to them to result in such a lame attempt at good music."
1,Disappointing if you liked the sound of the first two CD's,"I'm going to concur with a number of reviewers. If you liked Come On, Get It Together, Like a Movie, You Should Know, etc..., then don't expect to find any songs like those on this CD. It reminds me of Ash's Nuclear Sounds CD if you're an Ash fan -- I didn't like that either. Some of the reviewers liked the 'new' sound. We can all agree that it is a different sound. My review reflects two things: 1) I didn't like the new sound and 2) I was hoping for ten more upbeat songs like the ones in the first three CD's and was extremely disappointed."
5,A Guide to Artifacts of Colonial America,Excellent!! A lot of information and easy read. Great for quick reference.
5,A must have for any archaeologist!,"This book is a seminal work and a necessity for any archaeologist interested in or focusing on the historic period. While this book is mainly concerned with British colonial items, such items are found in almost any historic period site no matter the origin of the site's inhabitants. The ceramic section is the most valuable part of the book, but there is also a lot of information about other categories of artifacts. Collectors will also find this book useful in identifying items of British origin.The only drawback to this book is its paucity of illustrations and photos, especially color plates. There are photos/illustrations (black and white only) for selected items (especially ceramics), but much of the text would have been more informative if examples were included."
4,A must for Clipper Enthousiasts,"Sitting in my reading chair with my 3 feet Flying Cloud model (which took about 18 months to build) beside me, the story of the record breaking journey to San Fransisco became really alive. With the detailed descriptions of all things happening on board it seemed as if my scale model came to life. I really enjoyed reading it!"
3,Interesting read but too much fabricated dialog,"This book contains some very interesting factual information, but unfortunately too much fabricated and romanticized dialog. The author obviously has a great knowledge of sailing and the sea at the time of the clipper ships, but I found myself frequently skimming through the book to avoid the tedious fictional content."
1,The invented bits ruined it for me.,"Normally I will read and enjoy just about any non-fiction concerning the age of sail, but the non-fiction in this book gets drowned out by the (painfully obviously) contrived 'inner thoughts' of many of the participants.I cannot recommend you buying this book if you are hoping for a factual account of the construction and maiden voyage of a famous clipper (even though the actual reasearch that was done is adequate, if only just) , and, honestly, I cannot recommend this book to someone looking for a romantic fictionalized version of the same thing either. The romantic fiction stuff, in addition to being such pure invention, clunks something awful."
1,[I just didn't like the wingey characters.],"I know some people will probably say why is she writing a review for a Christmas romance book when it's only September 24th but I really felt I needed to write a review for this book. Well there isn't really much I can say except that I hated it and thought it was bad, the absolute pits! A real stinker! I just didn't like the wingey characters, I mean all they do is whinge about everything and I didn't think they really liked each other, in fact the hero seemed to hate the heroine, at least that's the impression I got because all he did was winge about everything she said or did and he kept putting her down. Wha's so romantic about that?"
2,So-So!,"Christmas Angel is about a lady named Angela Westgate who everyone calls Angel and a guy named Jonathan Stoddard, the book is just so-so, I didn't really enjoy this as much as other Christmas romance books because I just couldn't see why the characters wound up with each other when they didn't seem to like each other very much, all they did was antagonize and insult each other and the character Jonathan was the worst he was just too obnoxious, so it wasn't the best romance book that I have read and it's not a book I would keep or read again."
5,Not the typical romance with the typical characters,"I can see why many people who regularly read romances wouldn't like this book. The hero isn't the typical older man who sweeps the heroine off her feet, nor is he the usual arrogant, distant character who always has a bit of an upper hand over the heroine. In this story, the hero and heroine are childhood friends who after one unexpected night of passion went their separate ways. Now, nine years later, the hero is back to recapture what he was too young to recognize as the love of a lifetime. Rather than centering on a typical romatic wooing, the feelings of love and passion are taken for granted, and the hero works to win back the soul-melding closeness they had always shared. Unlike the majority of romance novels, the feelings in this novel seem like true, lasting love rather than mere attraction and infatuation."
3,Make sure to check the quantity,"I bought this as part of a present for my mom, who recently quit smoking. I thought I was getting a great deal because the picture showed it was 100 pieces. When I received it, I was disappointed to find it was a smaller package than I anticipated. I would have expected that in the description, the picture or somewhere else it would have stated 40 pieces. Maybe that has changed by this point, but I definitely felt misled."

1,Setting the Record Straight,I am the Laura Wandrie whom one of the reviewers speak of. They have a beef with this author and anyone who is associated with him gets slammed.

4,G9645 Hardness Tester,"This is a serious piece of equipment. Works well and gives consistent results. Mine arrived with some shipping damage, dial gauge was bent and broken. Wasn't too hard to readjust it and the nice folks at Grizzy promised to send me a new gauge R.S.N. Be sure to read the manual carefully, there are a lot of shipping restraints to remove and the manual is not crystal clear."
5,What can I say?,"This is perhaps one of the most phenomenal books I've read in the past year. Malouf's prose is intricate, flowing, and beautiful, and I found myself taking more time than usual after each story to ponder meanings and significances. Malouf is one of few writers to have completely mastered both style and content; his results are breathtaking. A must read."
2,If you have big hands go for it,The handle is to fat for my hands I had a very hard time using it. The idea to build a scoop with a larger handle is great but must keep in mind it is usually a woman scooping.
1,Cat claw,I don't know where the word Giant comes in. The slots are to wide and the litter goes right through. I could not use it and threw it away. I did not have time to return it as I was having surgery. The picture and add looked perfect for what I needed. Oh well. Thank you anyways
5,lovely dvd,"I bought this DVD for someone else, he loves it and says it's one the best shows he saw from O'Day."
2,Disappointing,Very disappointing. I was hoping this was a re-masterred version of an album formerly recorded by Anita O'Day. It is not Anita O'Day in her prime which I had thought this was. This was produced 2 years before her death at the age of 80+. Hardly Anita in her prime.
3,"Eh... Cute, But not all that great","The skirt is very cute, but the material bunches up in a really strange way. It also fits in an odd way, and not exactly like I thought it should fit my daughter. It did look exactly as described, however, and it arrived in a very quick fashion. It wasn't a complete bust, and my daughter did end up wearing it a little bit anyways."
2,Uni-tasker,"The half-moon edger is little more than a straight garden spade. A spade, at least, could also be used to dig a hole and plant a bush. This tool has one purpose, and as a uni-tasker, does the same job as a garden shovel would do as an edger.Perhaps I'm using it incorrectly, but over the years, I've edged with a knife, hand rotary edger, electric edger, weed-whacker, shovel, and even have used an ice-breaking tool. The half-moon edger does the same job the ice-breaker did. It's a lot of work, and the results are erratic."
1,POOR QUALITY,SOME WOLF GARTEN ITEMS ARE JUST NOT GOOD. THIS ONE USES VERY SOFT AND WEAK STEEL.THAT MEANS IT BENDS EASILY. THEY ARE NOT KEEN TO REPLACE IT EITHER.LOOK AT OTHERS OR HAVE ONE MADE LOCALLY.
5,"Exegesis, analytical thought and multi-level thinking","A great start to understanding how to analyze what appear to be problematic areas of biblical writings.Exegesis, analytical thought and multi-level thinking are traits that have diminished to almost extinction over the past couple of centuries - this book helps one restore some of those processes."
3,New International Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties,New International Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties [NEW INTL ENCY OF BIBLE DIFFICU]I purchased this book to send to a native missionary in Zimbabwe. My preacher recommended it as a helpful book!
5,Gets smells out,"I bought a new pair of pants several months ago, but after I washed them I noticed they had a strange sort of chemical smell, and no matter how many times I washed them it never went away. Well, I put two scoops of this in a large load of laundry with these pants, and the smell is gone! All of my clothes smelled super fresh and I noticed that it really helped with some stains too. I'll definitely be adding a scoop to every load from now on! Highly recommend!"
2,Not all that...,"I don't think this was any better than any other natural oxygen bleach. Plus, the packaging was absolutely terrible...the powder was everywhere in my box."
2,????,not sure if this stuff works as advertised. read another review for more specifics but i didnt like the product
4,great for anything,I plan to use this diluted to spray diapers before placing in diaper bag. But I am sure if it works well I can use it to spot clean all clothes.
4,Works!,"I could not get apple stains out of my daughter's brand new white sweater with anything...then I got this and it worked! They are not 100% gone, but went from dark brown to a very light tan, hardly noticeable, and the sweater is completely wearable now. Thank you biokleen!!"
4,As advertised,cleaned my grout lines good....a good buy! blag blah blag blah blah blag blah blag blah blah blag blah blag blah blah
2,Does not work!!!,I would not buy this product!!! I used it to try to clean the tile in my shower and was not pleased with the results. I saw no change. I could have just used Scrubbing Bubbles and gotten better results. Don't pay for this product thinking you are going to see a major difference. Use what you have in the cabinet.
3,havent used it yet,havent used it yet going to try it out on garage floor so got to wait on the right day to do this
3,Not quite what I needed,"I ordered this based on recommendations to use oxygen bleach for safe & effective tile grout cleaning. Well, it might be safer for the environment, but as far as cleaning goes, it did not work very well for me. As instructed, I let it sit on the grout and then I scrubbed & scrubbed, and still ended up going back to my other ""non-green"" grout cleaning product to finish the job. I tried to do the right thing, but it's just not gonna work for me. I'll be trying it out for other household cleaning though."
4,awesome sandal,"This a super comfortable sandal---especially for a wide foot and it is still cute and fun. The camelot color is beautiul---very neutral and can be worn with anything. The sole is soooo comfortable and soft. I feel like I am walking on air. I wear these to work, all day shopping, out at night. They are a great all day sandal."
4,Great shoes,I've received quite a few compliments about these shoes. They look really good. The fit is true to size. I only wear them when I'm going out in evening so can't say how they would be for long periods of wearing. But for 3-4 hours they are fine for me.
3,Seriously Flawed,"Awesome selection, but for some reason (in order to cram in so many tracks? to force compulsive types to buy complete versions?) the last 5 to 10 seconds have been clipped from many of the cuts. For example, the drum fill at the very end of Isley Bros. ""Behind a Painted Smile."" It's quite infuriating."
4,Great narrative history!,"This is a great book that I can highly recommend to anyone who liked The Professor and the Madman, Galileo's Daughter and other narrative histories of science. Heavenly Intrigue is a lot like Galileo's Daughter, too, in the sense that the authors translate a lot of Kepler's letters here for the first time, in this case showing us a dark side to the great scientist never revealed before."
4,very intriguing indeed,"An interesting view behind the scenes of two extremely important scientists of the 16th/17th century. With lots of interesting quotes, although with a slight bias in favour of Tycho, against Kepler. Some rather complicated theories of Kepler are very well explained."
4,clips!,"i have found little to no faults with this gun, i recently got it and have been very pleased. My only advice is to get extra clips and file out or not use the barrel extension(silencer), the clips are a little hard to load, and even harder if you forget your reloader, but if you buy other clips you'll be fine. the clips hold 24 rounds, these can be spent very quickly, so it's good to have extra clips like i said before.it comes with strap recharger, 100 bb's ect. all in all , it's a great deal"
4,so far so good,"this gun is cool, it comes with a 50 round clip, and a really crappy magazine (10 minutes of action, it is so weak that it cant shoot through a sheet of paper!!) the gun itself is fine, but get or make a better battery for it. the included charger sucks, i use my RC car chargerit looks and works very realisticly, fairly good quality and the hop up makes dramatic differencesdefinetly consider!!"
1,I don't know about the other reviewers here that gave it 5?,"This gun is a like a beautiful woman with no brains. It looks great and feels good to hold, but it has no real ability to function. It doesn't shoot well at all and is really spray and pray from close range only. The clip barely holds anything and you pretty much have to shoot burst on full-auto (rock and roll) to be a threat to anyone, unless you are going to hit them with the gun, in which case you could have bought a stick for less money. I would LOVE to give this gun a great review, I bought it because others had, but I must be honest with my fellow airsofters on Amazon, really I wish I could just have turned back time. Just like some girlfriends of the past, this is just something to waste you money on, resist."
1,BIG PIECE OF CRAP.....................,"THIS GUN IS A WORTHLESS PIECE OF CRAP. I shot 10 bb's and the clip jammed, then i fixed the clip and the gears jammed.. DO NOT BUY THIS GUN..."
1,No Good,"I thought this gun would be great but...the clip is really bad, it jams all the time and doesnt hold that many bbs. I could only get it to fire uside down and even on full auto it coudn't peirce a target! DO NOT BUT UNLESS YOU LIKE USELESS MODELS"
1,WHAT A GUY WILL DO FOR POONTANG !!!,"ELVIS!!! WAKE UP!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING!The Brodsky Quartet was tough enough, why would you do it to us again? You can't be that delusional to think anybody ever listens to these ""Experiments"" of yours.I can't believe I got conned again by the name Elvis Costello.Could you call yourself Declan McManus the next time you need to impress the girls, or is that the whole point of this release, let's milk the Suckers one more time?BUY THIS NOW! Hope that helps."
3,Mellow Costello,"Well, this falls into the category of ""mellow Costello.""In the vein (not vain, as some reviewers might have you believe) of The Juliette Letters and other gentle Elvis, this is a CD to throw on as background music, light the candles, sip the wine, and chill.Do NOT expect to rock, even for a second. Think slow jazz, and if you like Elvis' voice and the aforementioned style, you'll enjoy this CD.If you're expecting a return to the Attractions, you'll regret buying this one.For what it is, I like it. Elvis is top notch, a class act, and he rarely puts out junk.Definitely worth a listen."
4,Elvis Exposed,"Just when you thought you knew Elvis, he hits you with this unbelievably honest record. These are all very straight foward songs about love and loss, and it's very discriptive of the happenings in his private life. no social commentary. no sarcastic undertones. This is THE most sincere album he has ever written. He orchestrated all the songs beautifully. If you are particular fan of Elvis's early work, and more rock n roll stuff, you might not like it as much. It's all ballads, in contrast to his last release When I was Cruel. But it touched me...damnit....a good record"
1,"The only word to describe this record is "" Dirge""","You are brave man if you criticise an Elvis Costello record because the fans will say ""you don't get it"" or they will suggest that you are living in the past. The man himself has reacted very angrily to the very poor reviews and has accused critics of being dishonest. The only dishonest act is the one committed by Elvis Costello - its a painful dirge and it does not say so on the front cover. Come on you Elvis Fans, lets have some honesty, these reviews are supposed to help people buy decent records. ps The Delivery Man is great. rgds Andy (An Elvis Costello fan!!)"
4,A fun book,"I got this book years ago in, of all places, Atlanta. It's a whole lot of fun, very funny, and great for getting a feel for the meaning of the more common Yiddish expressions.My only two quibbles about it are sometimes the author lets politics of the ""Students Wildly Indignant..."" sort intrude a bit. And, he gives no guidelines on which of the more... um, ""colorful"" expressions might be considered inappropriate for polite company; a Jewish co-worker was kind of offended by some of the expressions he has in here with no warnings. (Some of these are obvious, of course.)But all in all, recommended."
4,Fun guide to Yiddish with lots of hilarious jokes.,"Fun guide to Yiddish with lots of hilarious jokes amongthe definitions. Don't miss the definition for ""schmuck"".This book is strictly for fun -- it's not really a dictionaryand wouldn't be of much use for learning the Yiddish language.But as a gift for friends who want to know more about Jewishhumor and culture it can't be beat."
5,Every Goys Guide to Common Yiddish Expressions,This book is a mitzvah if you need Yiddish translations. I keep it by my computer next to Websters so I can quote from it when I need Jewish flavoring in my e mails. A MUST for Jews and a wonderful gift for your non-jewish friends. There are many adorable jokes included.
4,Chillout music: in a league of it's own,"I picked this up a few days ago, because I have too many techno CDs, and I needed something a little quieter. At first I was a little disappointed because this isn't exactly what I expected, but after I got into the mood, I found these CDs mezmorizing. If you like chillout music but you don't have any Ministry of Sound chillout CDs, definitly buy this one!"
5,Best CD to relax to,"Great variety of music! Anyone who likes downtempo or moody brit-rock will love this! The songs flow so well into each other, before long you fill find yourself on a dreamy head trip..."
2,Disappointed,This is typical compilation cd-money-rip-off. They crank 2 cd full of songs but what you really get is maybe 6 good songs. Others are just average and mostly boring.... No wonder people are opting for alternative music sources.
5,"Great chillout, lounging CD","Just picked this up at the store yesterday and I love it! I was hearing so much about the release of this CD that I had to check it out! And I must say that I am not disappointed at all. The CD blends a great mixture of electronic and alternative downtempo music. I listen to a lot of electronic music, but this is great because it captures certain moods that other genres do not. I suggest going out and buying this CD! Ministry of Sound definitely releases some of the best dance and chillout compilations out there!"
5,One word....Incredible!,"This cd is awesome!I'm a long time D.R.I. fan but I have to saythat as a music fan in general this disc blew me away!This cd is as live as you can get, no studio remixes at all.The recording is exactly as the show went that night a few mistakes and a fight in the crowd, All recorded! If you want tohear a truly intense live recording pick up this cd....you won't regret it!"
4,D.R.I. - 'Live' (Rotten),"Nifty keepsake audio document of a live performance from those guys we know as Dirty Rotten Imbeciles {D.R.I.} - a true-to-their roots all American thrash punk metal band. Recorded off a date of their 'Definition' tour in late 1992. Have seen D.R.I. play in tiny hole-in-the-wall clubs twice now and I must say they're so much better (and more fun) to experience at a live setting than from a CD player in your living room. I remember hearing all these cuts way back when, especially the heavy-duty ""Trashard"", ""Acid Rain"", the *ss-kicking ""Violent Pacification"", ""The Five Year Plan"" and possibly their best known song (in the real world) ""Suit And Tie Guy"". Recommended good listening."
4,Diabetic multivitamiins,These vitamins replace several supplements I was already taking. nice to have a formula and not have to try and combine several pills. So far they seem to be helping.
2,Eeeeh...........,Not so sure how its suupposed to make me fill but not worth the price. Just makes my pee yellow and smell funny
4,Diabetic control,I have been a Diabetic for 20 years & have taken Completia Diabetic multivitamins for over ten years. I do believe it has helped me with the diabetic side effects. I live a normal life & cheat a bit on meals but am sold on Completia & Amazon has been my cheapest & reliable source.
3,"OK scanner, but no Digital ICE for image cleaning after scan","The title of the review says it all.Do NOT get this scanner. Get the Minolta Dimage Scan Elite for a little more with Digital Ice. I did quite a bit of research before deciding on this scanner, so I'll sum up for you what took me many hours. I also considered a couple of the lower end Minolta Dimage scanners, as well as the Nikon Coolscan and the HP Photosmart S20.Essentially, they all promise to scan 35mm film, and with an adapter, it can also do APS. However, promises are just that - empty for most of these scanners.This one is OK if you dont mind some bad scans b/c of no Digital Ice. If you spend another $100 you can get the Scan Elite which has the Digital Ice. A MUST have."
1,Not what I thought,"Thought this book was like new, it came with lots of marking and will not be able to be used."
4,GREAT OLD SCHOOL METAL,REMEMBER SEEING THESE BOYS WITH EXODUS BACK IN THE DAY. GREAT GREAT METAL BAND AND ALWAYS UNDER-RATED.
2,Doesn't work on half of it,"The button was easy to use and easy to install. However, the doorbell only rings when you push the button just right. It wasn't expensive enough to send back, plus I had already installed it."
4,For Fans a MUST...,"There is not much more to add to the previous reviews, just one thing: Everybody says ""limited edition"" - does anybody know how limited? Well, Rhino made just 2500 copies worldwide. So, whoever, like me, is so damn lucky to own one: treasure it! Listening to it you can learn about very good and very very good music..."
3,"some favorites, some not","""Memphis Soul Stew"" has to be the hottest live intrumental recorded -ever-, but most of the others are worthy of only one listen; simple, slightly funked-up, but mostly just instrumental renderings of the original vocal lines. Aretha's is top form here, but speeding up 'Respect' just doesn't do it for me, and especially not for $235!!"
3,"Better than some, worse than others","Sound is OK. Better than the king album at the fillmore but I've heard better fillmore concert tapes (granted more recent). Not sure of a better way to break out the discs, but the song selection is rather repetative across any two discs. I understand it was probably to condense it onto as few cds as possible, but outside of dumping this to my ipod eventually, the variety in the shows isn't great enough to justify inclusion of each version from each show."
2,2 stars for the album,"Yes, it's a good song. Probably the most interesting song of the new album ""Metamorphoses"". But the album is not so good, so 2 stars only ! Hey Jarre, come back with real Jarre works like Oxygene or Equinoxe !"
5,Changing for the new millenium!,"C'est La Vie is the first single release off the new Jean michel Jarre album METAMORPHOSES. The album is his first to feature lyrics in every song, and this single is a superb example of the totally refreshing sound of the album. Long time Jarre fans will revel in the freshness and vibrancy, recollecting the release of Revolutions, and new listeners will be amazed by the grandfather of techno/ambient dance music."
5,Piper Knocks It Out Of The Park!,"John Piper offers thorough exegesis in refuting the Arminian treatment of Romans Nine, Which basically says this great chapter refers to nations rather than individuals and service rather than salvation. If you want a quick read this is not the book for you. Written in a gracious tone, but firm in its conclusions. Excellent job, John!Pastor Peter HoldaasBlaine, WA[...]"
4,Best Calvinist work on Romans 9...,"...however, it doesn't address the argument of the person who had the best non-calvinistic explanation of Romans 9... (drum roll please)... Arminius!! Piper in a calm and persuasive manner goes inch by inch through each verse and utterly demolishes the hypothesis that Romans 9 discusses nations, not individual destinies. However, that wasn't Arminius' premise (which in some places is remarkably similar to Piper's) and the fact that Piper didn't go over verse 30 leaves a hole in his explanation that's big enough to drive a truck through. For all of its in depth analysis of the Greek and Hebrew, the book is still extremely readable and a good page turner. Anyway, if you are an Arminian, you will most likely have your views challenged in a good way and if you're a Calvinist, you will probably walk away from it satisfied, but look around for Arminius' explanation, you might be pleasantly suprised that there are legitimate intellectual reasons for being an Arminian."
