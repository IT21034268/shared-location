4,Fast but Not Long,"True, this battery charges in 15 minutes with the Rayovac charger, but it will be self-drained in two weeks if left unused after a full charge. I used the AAA battery in my travel alarm clock and it lasted eight months before it required a recharge. The bottom line is charge the battery only when you have an imminent application. I have also used SONY 900mah NiMH AAA rechargeable batteries. The SONY battery also self drains but will retain power for around 1 month if left unused after a full charge. However, the SONY battery will take hours to get a full charge. If you like battery that can retain power longer, try the new hybrid battery by Sanyo, Rayovac, and SONY. These are available at prices comparable to the older NiMh rechargeable battery."
4,Not available in English that I know of,"I so looked forward to receiving this book! So many references, so much to look forward to. I am not fluent in French. This book is printed in French. I am using it as a learning tool, but I am still disappointed. Not in the book, but in the fact that I have yet to locate an English translation. I maintain that it is a real gem, but have to wait until I learn the language to read it."
4,Very Good Value for the Price,"We have gone through speakers lots of speakers before and these perform very well. The price was outstanding and the sound quality good. Not the top of the line speaker, but how good is the sound quality at the lake with a 350 horsepower engine roaring anyway? And the price couldn't be beat. The drawbacks are they do not have a quick detach feature for easy removal and they are a bit bulky."
5,Best Option For The Money,"Love these things. Quickly went through two pairs of Cadence tower speakers before switching to these guys and wish I started with these. They sound great and are doing fine in salt water spray (6 months old). You'll need a big amp to power them but they sound great and are good quality. With two speakers, we can comfortably hear music at 65' back on the board while not being too loud for people in the boat.Confusing they say system, as there is only one speaker per purchase. Still a great value. I'm sure the name brand wake speakers are great, but for the money, you really cant beat these things! Oh, and the newest model with the big silver attachment clamp does fit a 2.5"" Monster tower with no problem."
2,Don't purchase,"I purchased 2 of these units and put them on the back of my pontoon so I could listen to them while swimming and while outside the boat. After 3 days of listening to them 1 of the speakers was very ""tinny/ buzzy"" and sounded horrible. I called amazon and they shipped out a replacement that I received in a few days, while waiting for the replacement the other speaker developed a horrible rattle. Basically both of these speakers blew within 7 days of putting them in. I returned all speakers and will invest my money on something that is not made in China. Amazon is very good with the returns.Also these speakers state 550W - they are no where near this. DON'T purchase these. The Case of unit is nice."
4,Worked on Jeep needs an Amp,"I installed this on my Jeep CJ. Fit really nicely on the roll bar between the seats (I do not have a back seat). The mount is great for roll bars. You definitely need an amp for this guy. My only complaint is the wire connections. They are on top, exposed to elements, and there is no way to protect."
1,"All show, no go. Not 550w. Don't buy unless you just listen to talk radio.","What a shame, they look good on paper and in the pictures, but are not as advertised. I've installed systems for years, and hoped these were legit. I installed in my boat with a 75w RMS per channel high-end amp, and the speaker quit the first time out. Never even played it hard, just used while parked and swimming. Now I'm 38 days after purchase, they will only cover the first 30 days 100%. Boss wants me to pay for shipping to them, plus give them $20 for their return shipping. What a joke. Instead I will use that $40 to put towards a real set of 6x9 speakers to put in these cases. BTW, the cases and mounts are very nice, just crap for speakers."
4,GREAT READ,"This was the book that introduced me to cyberpunk when I was 15. I go back to this book again and again as the years go by. Some of the stories in here are so perfect (500 Boys, Synners, Stone Lives, Tales of Houdini) that I find myself trying to emulate the slick, tight, ultracool writing style. Other stories from this collection are less interesting and fall short of the mark, but are still worth reading."
2,Not as good as expected...,"Finishing this book, I get the feeling that the main features of cyberpunk are obscure plotting and flashy hi-tech terms. The only story that made any attempt at a straightforward plot was ""The Gernsback Continuum"". Unfortunately, it was the first story, and the book quickly dissolved into a mix of tenuous tales, the meanings of which are beyond me. I'm not sure what the editor was trying to say by using these stories to represent the ""cyberpunk"" field.In short, this one's going to the used bookstore."
2,Could be better??,"Either I do not believe the book has a good selection of Cyberpunk stories collection, or there are not that many good Cyberpunk stories?? Being a classical Sci-fi fan reading all those Asimov and classical stuff, this sort of new blood stories doesn't live up to it. May be I haven't seen the real good Cyberpunk story yet. But certainly not this collection."
1,A Very Confusing Book!,I have read all this authors books and have hoped that she would get better. But her plots are very confusing and you really have to pay attention to the details. The stories are something you just can't care about. I really do not reccomend this book.
5,A worthwhile read,"I purchased the book after hearing Glenn Beck tout the praises of Mormonism. I wanted - no I needed - to know more.As I read I began to realize that Mormonism is not all that Mr. Beck would have us believe. Mormonism is not just another religion within Christianity - the two are polar opposites of each other. The similarities between Islam and Mormonism are obvious.This book will open the eyes of the sincere seeker of truth and will show the differences between Mormonism, Islam and Christianity. I challenge all to read the very informative book."
2,Misleading title,"Dr. Nelken has compiled a series of articlesby a variety of authors dealing with particularlydiverse aspects of exotic options.Although some of the papers contain usefulinformation, the book does not deserve tobe called a ""handbook"": it is more like aloose compilation, thus making it uselessas a reference.I ordered the book in 1998 at my localbookstore and felt cheated after thefirst browsing. The extra star is thereto praise the occasional pearl of wisdomyou will encounter while reading throughall 15 chapters.Finally, the cover advertises with""valuable software included"", referringto a demo (!) of EXOTICOP (c). I stronglydisagree: the program is nothing morethan a black-scholes type exotics pricerwith a primitive interface, barely touchingthe level of an undergraduate paper.To add insult to injury, some of theinput parameters are frozen in thedemo version.To put it in dealer's phraseology, thisbook is a big yours."
2,Speeches listed hardly worth reading,You have in this book speeches that are hardly worth reading. Who in the world wants to read in a a book of great speeches Clintons speech about Monica Leuwinski. There are many similar such rediculous ones in this book. I should have returned it but just threw it away.
3,Be sure to read 'From the Author' above,"It is in the interest of the agenda ridden individual, right or left, to besmirch any honest historical work. The USA is the most ""progressive"" nation on earth. A work that did not contain predominate ""progressive"" thought would not represent the nation of the 20th Century. I unfortunately can't rate this book with its current sold out state. It is also unfortunate that I can't submit a comment without including a rating. I gave it a 3 star that means nothing. I wish I lacked in integrity to the point of rating the book prior to reading it as those that have obviously done so already including the original critic!"
2,America Through A Liberal Lens,"Sure, the editors have included many apolitical works to legitimatize their collection. But the real agenda is obvious--the advancement of liberal political philosophies at the expense of objectivity. Not surprising though, since Torricelli is a leading member of the east-coast liberal establishment."
4,Great Reference of Speeches,"Look - this compilation of speeches is well worth checking out. You can find the history of the 20th century wrapped up in the writings. From Roosevelt to Clinton there is much to be digested in this work. Any student of politics or history will be well served to read through this book and refer to it going forward. It is interesting to see how the language of speeches changes in the present, and how it recalls much of the past.Classic speeches from JFK, Reagan, MLK, Clinton, etc will keep you interested, and some other speeches will put you to sleep. The point is - you will know more about our world, and the USA if you check out this book.Joseph Dworak"
4,This is REAL music....,"I remember I saw Lyfe on Showtime at the Apollo. He took my breath away with his original songs, and I remember I said, this guy is going to really shine. Well...his debut album does just that. He does an excellent job at letting us know how gritty life can get, but how GOOD it feels to rise back up after you've experienced the worse. He writes songs about all of the things that have happened to him, including making up, breaking up, having kids, going to jail, and coming back out on top after it all.Songs that shine are ""Stick up Kid"", ""Greedy"", ""My Lyfe"", and ""Must Be Nice."""
5,Excellent CD!!!,"I Love this cd. Not one song is bad, but the best song on the cd is ""Cry"" I can hear the pain in his voice. This cd is a must have for anyone that loves r&B/soul music."
5,"A DIAMOND IN A ROUGH A-DUB GARY, INDIANA","I'VE READ ALL THE REVIEWS AND I SEE THAT THIER ARE STEAL SOME PEOPLE HOW DON'T KNOW REAL MUSIC TO BAD BUT NOW I CAN SEE WHY NELLY, MASTER P, LIL FLIP, AND A HOST OF OTHERS ARE STEAL IN THE GAME YOU KEEP BUYING THAT GARBAGE BUT I'M GOING TO STICK WITH MY BOY LYFE THE ONLY THING WRONG WITH THIS CD IS THE PRICE I GOT IT FOR $11.99 I NEED TO FIND LYFE AND GIVE HIM ANOTHER $10.00 KEEP IT UP DOG MUCH LOVE DOING YO THING EVERYTHING I SAID IS A FACT GET YO ASS UP AND GET THIS CD NO BOOTLEGS SUPPORT THIS MAN"
5,Uh!! Better Late Than Never!!!,"Whew...a breath of fresh air! I'm late and I know it, but I haven't been this excited about someone if a very long time. Hearing this man's life story in the expanse of 14 songs was a musical journey I have trouble finding any fault with. From beginning to end I found myself hitting the repeat button often. Consequently it took me a while to get through the whole cd. At times, raw and gritty. His reality is a harsh truth that most of us never have to experience. I'm happy he chose this outlet to tell his story. I am sure we'll hear much more from this man in the future. An extraordinary first effort!"
5,Wow!,"This cd blew me away! It was like listening to a movie or audio book I am very impressed. It made me laugh and cry but mainly think because I see so many black men in his situation but not tryin to turn their lives around. I am proud to see someone that has come to terms with the mistakes that they've made and make something positive out of if. I feel that Lyfe will be around for a long time. My favorite tracks are Made Up, Hypothetically, and Cry but really all of the tracks are well put together. I can't wait to see what's next."
1,Coaster Material...,"Did you hear the same thing I did? This is ""Coaster Material""...something I will place my glasses on so it doesn't stain the table. This kid is Apollo made. ""Made for the Apollo, not the big stage."" Might make a good back-up singer. He is a bad mix between Jahiem and Dave Hollister. Why does ""Stick Up"" have a love song track? Why is his entire album an random episode between him and some chick with a kid. Where's the versitility people. I couldn't get past the irritating singing long enough to notice the elementary lyrics. Kid needs a lot of work, before he can be considered a real artist and not just a singer. I would not recommend this album. Worse album I've heard since Myron.Jah"
1,So Disappointed,"I saw this CD on the racks at the music store, and immediately got excited. I heard so many great reviews about this brother, and I remember seeing him wow the audience on Apollo several times. I was hesitant, but I decided to go ahead and buy it. I wish I followed my instict!While Lyfe's CD holds great potential to be a wonderful piece of art, in my opinion at times the lyrics were predictable, mundane, and lack-luster. The music on the tracks is great, but the lyrics were quite a let down. After each new track would start, the music would let me anticipate lyrics worth listening to, but instead, all that was left was a huge disappointment.Lyfe has talent, indeed, and his voice offers a unique quality that is not found in many R&B; artists. He sings from his soul and with emotion, no doubt, but his lyrics leave something desired."
1,ain't happening,"This CD is horrible. When I heard ""Must Be Nice"" I thought this CD would be worth a listen. Boy, was I wrong. I was trying to give this CD a chance but to be honest I wasn't feeling none of these songs. They were absolutely horrible and did not appeal to me at all. What are you people thinking giving him so many positive reviews. Are you all high on something? This is the worst record I have heard. First of all he gives a little history narration before every song which is very annoying. What really hurts this CD is the lack of quality lyrics, the right melodies and beats. I know he writes his own songs but he really needs help in producing quality music. The only song I liked was ""Smile"". This one is something to listen to. It has that 1970's flavor and actually sounds like music. The rest is just garbage and his voice isn't that great either, a little too husky.If you are in your right mind do not buy this CD. It is a waste of money."
1,OH Boy PLEASE WHERE IS THE REAL MUSIC!!!,"I think this is a well over rated CD. He sound like crap why are all producer so lazy that they are picking up singers from jail??? Like AKON and others that can not sing like they could not stop from dropping the soap. Where are the real producer or where is the skills at. So what he won the Apollo he have no lyrics or singing skills please stop the donation to the commissary fund. His lyrics do not match the music and all the people that rate the CD over 1 star something is wrong with your ears for real music. Please R&B find the real talent in singing, rap is all ready DEAD and sold out do not let it happen to R&B. Do I have to stay in the 80's and 90's because of the lazy producer these days!!! PLEASE HELP THE R&B INDUSTRY !!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great CD,This CD is nice. The writers did an excellent job. However his voice becomes aggravating after a while so its not an all day repeat type CD for me.
5,Very good CD,This album I almost didnt even pick up but after I finally did I was mad at myself for not getting it earlier this is a very well put together album and the whole storytelling aspect of it going from one song to the next is very good and I enjoyed every song on this album dont hesitate on getting this.
5,Lyfe Jennings First Album,I had this CD when it first came out it got scratched over the years but it was one I had to have again!!!
3,ok,purchase was made for one song heard on a gospel station. cd was received timely. probably wouldn't have bought otherwise.
4,Great CD,"I love this CD. The music is very soulful. I first heard Stick up Kid listening to online radio. After that I looked up this kid and read the reviews. I bought this CD soully on the reviews and I am glad that I did.Only problem with this CD is there aren't enough songs and the songs are waaaayyyy too short.My favorite songs are Hypothetically, Stickup Kid, Greedy, She got Kids, Cry."
5,Lyfe,"Lyfe is to 2004 as Anthony Hamilton was to 2003. This CD is a must have for any CD collection. Each song has a story to tell. To pick a favorite would be unfair. It would all depend on what you have been through in your LYFE. This CD should get a nomination for a Grammy, American Music and Soul Train Award for Best R&B Album."
5,Kudos,I think it was a brilliant idea to rerelease this album. He's finally (FINALLY!!) getting his props. Folks have been sleeping on him for far too long. The album is so worth the money.
3,Good Album,This album is well put together. Each track takes you into a story of his life and things that he has been through. He is a solid artist and with the right direction he could go far. This is not one of my favorites but it is definately a great mood album.
5,Lyfe is deep.......,"This CD is soooo hot. I remember a while ago before he got discovered and he was on apollo performing his song ""cry"". I called all my friends to watch him for the rerun of the show and waited for him to make it big because he has sooooo much talent and his lyrics are not sugar coated they are soooo real and his soulful voice is definately a plus. Hes not an artist that sings about popular stuff but real life issues that you can identify with. I suggest that everybody hit up this cd for some REAL lyrics and a voice that is unlike any other."
2,"DISAPPOINTMENT, but it's growing on me...","I'm sorry I have to be Honest... I was really disappointed in this album. After hearing ""Must Be Nice"" I was expecting a little more out of him. To me, all of his songs sound the same. And I had this confirmed by letting a friend listen to it. We were listening to the CD on a road trip and after skipping through every track, we just took CD out and never put it back in. Maybe I'm being critical, but that's just my opinion of the album. He's falling into that ""The only song I liked was the one they played on the radio"" category this year.Update.**03/23/06** I still go with my initial review above... but I do think the track ""Hypothetically"" is very nice and extremeley clever, meaning, it's really unique.. unlike any other song out there.. it really makes u think and I applaud Mr. Jennings for that... I still have to stand by my initial review and say the CD is a bit too much of an autobiography for me.. I admire the theme, but it gets tiresome..."
2,"""Must Be Luck"" that you have a record deal","I first heard ""Lyfe"" on Apolo late one night and I didn't find the ""spark"" that everyone else seems to be finding within him.Lyfe has a different and yet typical voice with the raspyness. I honestly want to love ""Lyfe"" like everyone else seems to be doing, but I just can't feel a vibe from him. He needs some work on his songs, better yet, his arrangements because it's not fitting for his voice. I'd like to see something more interesting happen to him than this. The CD itself isn't so bad, I've heard snips and pieces of it and i'm still the same way about it, it's just borderline of good. Personally, I believe it's too much hype regarding his album of being ""great"". He's no John Legend, or Smokie Robinson, but maybe as the years progress, he'll have more hope, and from what i'm expecting to prove me wrong of being just another ""one hit wonder""."
2,I wanna like it.,But dude can't sing. Sorry but his voice just reminds me of a cheese grater. Honest effort. But he's no Anthony Hamilton.
1,LYFE - WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE...,"Is what his record company should have given his CD. Someone recommended his CD to me and I resisted for about 9 months. Now I know why. Look, I'm glad the brotha got himself straightened out, that's all to the good, but I don't wanna hear about it all throughout his CD.I got tired of his whiny-voiced narration throughout the set - GOT ON MY DAMN NERVES! I guess I'm also tired of the black man having to tell his story - THE PRISON STORY - all the time. We're MORE than Jail & Drugs!If you guys REALLY wanna hear someone keeping it REAL, pick up Donnie's ""The Colored Section"" and THEN you'll see what REAL really is.I'm probably gonna throw my copy in the trash.Sorry 'bout that, Lyfe. But ya never, maybe next Lyfe-time I'll give you props...just not this one."
5,"ROUGH, RUGGED, NATURAL TALENT","I just have one word for this CD...HOTTTT!!! If you're into that all naturale sound with true heart and guetto vibes, you'll love this CD! Lyfe has amazing vocals that are raw and pure. The lyrical talent is evident as well. Don't sleep on this one folks! Please! This must be added to your collection! There is not one song on this CD I don't like. I just stick it in the CD player and let it play. No skipping necessary! If you're only into those watered down, bubble gum hits, played on the radio a million times a day type songs, this CD is not for you."
5,off the chain,"I love this cd it's something that a person can relate to. Lyfe is a very talent person, he speak about what people think about and what they're going through."
5,lyfe,"THIS IS A GOOD ALBUM. HIS VOICE IS WORTH THE MONEY I SPENT ON IT. HE'S A CASE IN THE GROWUNG SO, IF YOU LIKE CASE YOU WILL LIKE LYFE."
5,Real,"Hey, to anybody who is tired of R&B singers just singing bout the women they have and sex, check out this cat, Lyfe Jennings. I picked up this cd based on his single must be nice, but I wound up listening to the whole cd in one sitting. Its that good. He keeps it real and tells the story of his lyfe, leaving nothing out and basically keeps it real with how he feels. He goes from love to child support to fake people in church to God and ends it all with an uplifting song to all those incarcerated that are trying to do right. So, for a breathe of fresh air in the R&B genre, check out Lyfe 268-192."
5,Album of the Year,"I remember going to a Musiq concert and was kind of upset because I wanted to hear more of him then Musiq. From the beginning to the end this album is an classic. Each song tells a story. The Best Songs on the album are I can't, ""Greedy"" (personal reasons) and ""26 years and 17 days"". If you really like R&B Music it is a must you go out and pick up this album."
3,Okay Cd,This cd teaches you to appreciate what you have when you get it. I only enjoyed a couple of songs on the cd and not the entire cd.
2,it's ok,"Lyfe has a decent voice.instrumentation is decent as well.I dig ""She got Kids""&stick Up Kid"" but He hasn't fully found His voice as of yet that remains to be seen where he ends up.but He has talent."
3,Lyfe 268-192 by Lyfe,"Lyfe is the male Jill Scott. His smooth, calming soul music is as honest as it comes. The debut album, Lyfe 268-192, from the five time Showtime at the Apollo champion is great. Tracks like ""Stick up Kid"", ""Cry"" & ""I Can't"" really showcase his creativity, both lyrically and emotionally. His delivery is just as unique as his subject matter, acoustic & live instruments backing his every syllabol with the ability to make you truly feel where he is coming from and the pain behind his speech. The spoken words that follow the conclusion of each record explains what the song is about and the mind state that he was in when it was recorded, making the album that much more personal and that much easier to be respected by the listener. The album's finest moment is ""Must be Nice"". I just love everything about that song. I'm repeatedly impressed by this young musician throughout the entire course of the record. Its very rare to find an artist whos material is so moving and inspiring."
5,Phenomenal!,"I listened to a little of this cd in Borders, bought it, and have been smitten (SMITTEN!) ever since. This man can sing. To say that I am in awe would be putting it lightly. These lyrics are HIS and, my GOD does he deliver them. His honesty is appreciated; his soul can be felt in every single song (esp. ""Made up my Mind"". I swoon like nobodys business whenever I hear it). What I like most about Lyfe is that he isn't contrived; he's real. He's coming directly from the heart, humble and open, telling his story as sincere as possible and I can't be mad at him for it. I wouldn't dare compare him to Jaheim or John Legend or Van Hunt because, in my opinion, they cannot possibly compare. He is a positively gifted singer, songwriter, and musician and I am now officially on his bandwagon, waiting on pins and needles for him to play in my city."
3,Must be Lyfe,"I would give him 4 stars, but his voice is a little rough around the edges for me. If it wasn't for that, I think I would like this album alot more. He's definitely brining the R&G style with his songs about Life and sometimes it's harsh reality. The lyrics are really what carry this cd. He doesn't have the best voice, nor beats, but the lyrics are on point. My favorite tracks are ""Must be nice"", ""Hypothetically"", and ""26 years, 17 days""."
5,Wolf charm,"I am very pleased with the Wolf charm that I purchased to go on a charm bracelet. My daughter and I love the Twilight books and by December most of the Bella bracelets were already sold out for Christmas. I found this charm and some other Twilight related charms individually, bought a bracelet for both of us, and put the charms on myself. It was delivered ahead of schedule and made a wonderful gift."
3,Needs more examples,"This book touches on some great areas - but can be quite vague.It could be improved with further examples, and a straight forward description of ideas - then move into the more theoretical information.There are a lot of details on the process/ reasoning behind the research degrees.I have found other books to be more useful, though this is a reasonable source of information."
1,Scholarly and inaccessible,"I've enjoyed many of the Anchor Bible Commentaries. This one, however, is best left to the academe. Highly technical, there is little to draw from as a resource for an adult bible class or small group study if you are not well-versed in Hebrew. Save your money for a more accessible resource like those in the Interpretation series."
2,many errors,"I purchased this book based upon the reviews shown here, but have found the book to be full of coding errors and mistakes. It also reads like a text book written by a professor without any connection to the real world. It does have some value, but it certainly isn't worth the price. My recommendation is to look elsewhere."
4,"Esoteric, yet entertaining and informative","You have to love books and the history of how and why they are the way they are organizationally and physically to enjoy this book. Subtitled ""A Guide to Literary Curiosities,"" Kevin Jackson brings us deep into the world of book parts and how they came to be.From introductions to prefaces, from pseudonyms to heteronyms, the author embellishes the book with the history that makes them what they are and uses many examples to illustrate his ideas. He describes the origins and uses of blurbs, dedications, epigraphs, and footnotes (which borrows heavily from Anthony Grafton's The Footnote: A Curious History).Jackson looks at marginalia and stage directions, lectures and last words as used in books. Finally, he addresses the back matter of books: appendixes, bibliographies, and indexes.This is excellent reading for the historically inclined and for bibliophiles."
2,Too much sugar and not enough plum for this fairy,"Unremitting jocularity can wear you down. The most dignified thing about these fatuous pages is the title. When I got to John Julius Norwich's favourite first lines (p131) I could feel myself coming over all Leavisite. To the barricades! The smugness is palpable. At least he credits us with recognising a little bit of Dante unaided (p80). For the rest? Middlemarch contains 86 epigraphs? Tfoo! If this makes me 'some dopey critic' (p112 footnote), well, tough"
4,"No complaints here, yum!","I sent one of these to my Dad on Father's Day and ordered one for myself. We both agreed that it was very good. The wife made alfredo sauce and elbows one night and I wanted some protein in it - yep, I went there - and it was great!"
3,Bought it primarily for the color prints,There are many books written about The Fauves and Andre Derain. But I wanted a small book that had excellent reproductions of the Fauvist color wheel. The works for me.
3,heemmm...,its not a bad book but i can surely say that you can find better books available from any book store.but if you like this then dont bother yourself with others trying to find a better one.
2,Watch out for the doctor,"Good idea, but somehow the film doesn't get under your skin. It's nice enough to watch it once but it doesn't haunt you - well, with one exception: Gretchens plastinated body did shake me. But then, it's all been here before in ""Waxworks"" and other oldies, and the bad, bad doctors aren't exactly new villains. So, if there's absolutley nothing on the telly one evening and all your friends are out, it may be allright. Otherwise not."
4,bring on the subtitles,"It would make a better rent than purchase, but well worth it. I'll spare the details of the story (there is enough in the other reviews), only to say it's creepy, well done, and not entirely implausible. Humans have played guinea pigs for scientists enough times to make you feel squirmy when watching this movie. I didn't mind the subtitles at all and the German language adds a nice proto-fascist creep factor."
2,"ack, dont watch while eatting....","Although this is a horror, the scary live-autospy didnt take first seat here. I felt through out the entire movie that it wasnt its major theme. Im not a big fan of Potente, and never saw her other movies, but im a huge fan of medical thrillers. The ""scary scenes"" were done so that the audience only got to watch the poor humans face as he contorted as he was beeing cut, not much else, so this wasn't really that scary.this felt more like one of those scary wanna be teen flicks, and the secret AAA! society wasn't talked about or shown much! This is a pretty weak movie in my opinion, although it had my mom gasping, but shes a bigger scardy kat then anyone else out there. Most of the movies was about mediacl students chasing each other with scalepels and sedatives......."
2,Anatomy,This Movie was nauseating to see shooting victims with stuff that makes their blood and tissues go into a plastic human model like appearances then while they're dying do operations on them. the only reason I seen this movie was because of Sebastion Blomberg was in it and seeing him naked on the table at the end of the movie was the only highlight of the movie. sorry if I have a dirty mind but oh well. if you have a strong stomach and enjoy really gory movies then this movie is for you but if you don't then bring a bag with you
4,Great little movie with twists and turns and excitement,"I don't get the people that gave this one and two stars. I think to tag it as horror might be a mistake. It is more like a mystery thriller. Lots of twists and turns and a great exciting end of movie run with a nice touch during the credits, don't miss it."
2,Scary!,"I love Franka Potente, so I figured I'd give this movie a try. Run Lola Run, and The Princess and the Warrior being my all time favorite two. This movie scared the living daylights out of me! She does some seriously creepy stuff. I will not be watching the second and will always use caution with more of her movies!"
2,Horror Flick,"Paula is accepted into an anatomy class. Classmates turn up dead in the morgue. Paula uncovers a secret medical society that performs autopsies on still alive patients. I wouldn't recommend it. The acting was horrible and when turned the audio into English with no subtitles the voice still didn't match up with movements of the mouth. I would not want to see it again. And the ""nudity"" is on men."
3,Memories...NOT,"We pulled some stunts in Anatomy Lab in college, but none went this far. This first time I seen this movie was the ""Anatomie"" version. I like both. Content-wise...a little sluggish, but not always predictable. There were enough surprises to keep you from turning off the movie. The second half is much better than the first half."
3,A Fine German Film,"This was a breath of fresh air. Franka Potente (Run Lola Run) is outstanding as the lead actress and the rest of the cast are not bad. The special effects must be seen to be believed, I mean flawless, if you like very real looking gore then this the movie for you. They even have an English audio track for those who are feeling lazyor just to stoned to read the subtitles.See it friends its a good one."
2,Same-Old Same-Old Horror Flick,"After seeing Potente and Furmann together in Tom Tykwer's riveting ""Princess and the Warrior,"" it was a bit of a novelty to watch them slum their way through this Hollywoodish teen horror film. Unfortunately, that's no reason to see it--beyond its one or two sparsely distributed gore sequences, it doesn't offer anything very disturbing or engaging. By now I've accepted that American film-makers believe that every modern horror tale must have a mediocre college romance plot at its center, but when exactly did the Germans pick up on the habit?"
3,Are there any other German actresses?,"The movie itself was creepy and entertaining, even though the concept is not exactly original. I knew pretty much where the movie was going, but still, was curious to see how the formula would be executed.I have nothing personal against Franka Potente, but she seems to be the only German actress known in America. She is bearable, overall. Doesn't have any major physical flaws or annoying habits, but without her orange mop that we saw in ""Lola"" she is quite plain. She should play psychos and troubled girls. ""Normal"" roles are not for her. Without funky makeup, she is boring to begin with, and when she plays boring normal people, that's like a double dose of sleeping pills."
4,Star Wars Galaxy of fear The swarm,"I think that this book would be about 2 kids that fight giant bugs. Yes,the book was what I Expected It to be. I still feel the same about this book. Nothing about this book has changed.Thi9s book is about these kids who go to this planet called''Sk'rrr'' and one of the kids accidently kills a bug. The main characters are:Zak,Tash,and Hoole.The setting is at the SikadianGarden. The Book was actually about 3 kids that go to a planet called''sk'rrr''and one of them kills a shreev and it upsets the swarm of bugs.This book is Fiction.The author is John Whitman.I like this book because it has fighting in the book and ithas adventure striving in it. I would rate this book 4 stars. Theheadline for this book is:The Sikadian Garden on Sk'rrr has manybeautiful plants and flowers."
1,"Wigwam Men's Cool-Lite Pro crewSocks, white,Large","They are Not large enough, and fairly inflexible. Inelastic, Cheap, and unwearable for me. I discarded them. I wouldn't recommend buying them"
4,"Nice ""LITE"" Sock",Just right! Very lite-weight and seem well made(not as good as the older version) They might seem small when you first get them but they stretch so there is no extra material in your shoes/boots to cause blisters!
4,"Amazing socks, wish they'd last longer","I tend to make holes in my socks quickly. Alas these don't fare any better and actually wear out faster than the cheap cotton tube socks (the only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars). They are amazingly comfortable. I go out of my way to ensure I'm wearing wigwam's if I know I'll be standing a lot in a day. Also excellent breathability for exercise. I get noticeably reduced foot sweat / odor. They're are not cheap, but even still they are definitely worth having a few pairs around."
1,Poor quality socks,"I wanted these socks for a trip to Europe, where I would use them daily to walk, run, and hike. I have 2 old pair of Ultimax socks that I love. My research lead me to the replacement which appeared to be these Wigwam Cool-Lite Pro socks. I had planned to buy 9 pair if I liked the one pair I ordered. As soon as we received the socks, my wife washed them for me as is my custom. They were washed with a load of other whites, including other socks. These Wigwam socks came out pilled............and not just a little pilled, but a lot. And there was a thread coming out of the sock where it would be on the top of the foot. Point: these $11/pair socks were of very poor quality. I was very disappointed. I returned the socks."
4,Wigwam Cool Light Socks do Cool,I've just tried these a few times wearing army combat boots and they seem to work well. They kept my feet much cooler than regular socks while sitting in an office wearing boots that are more appropriate for working outside. I'd recommend giving them a try if your footwear is making your feet feel too warm. They seem well-made and durable too.
5,Comfortable with Coolmax Wicking Fiber,"I find this pair of socks very comfortable to wear. I bought these socks for summer wear with their wicking ability but have made them my everyday use socks. Of course in the future I will find out how long they will last and also how well they wick the moisture away from my skin but as of now I am happy with this Wigwam Men's Cool-lite Pro Quarter Length Socks. This review is for the White, Large as I bought three pairs each of both the white and grey colors. This would be the same rating review I would give the grey colored Wigwam men's socks as well."
5,GOOD DEAL FOR THE PRICE,This was a good deal for the price. The one issud by my employer was taped and retaped. Now I have enough to last and share with coworkers!
4,Catalina,All I got to say about this film is this. Catalina is nude in it and thats all I need to know to view it!
3,"Tough to use, or am I doing it wrong?","It removes SOME of the solder, but for the really sticky situations, it doesn't quite cut it.I am looking into investing in a solder vacuum for future solder-removal purchases.As far as I know though, there might be a better way to use this stuff than I know of."
5,Don't serve in the military without it!,"I wish I had this book 25 years ago when I first came into the military. Nelson helps you avoid a number of financial mistakes that many civilians and military people make. For example, last year a"
3,OK as far as it goes,"He has an interesting idea for organizing his advice, though I'm not sure it matches my thought patterns. The book is not terribly technical - nothing like the Malmuth/Sklansky book. For my money I like to play tighter than he advises."
2,Good book for newbies only,"If you have been playing 7 card stud for any reasonable amount of time, do yourself a favor and skip buying this book. Go buy 7 Card Stud for Advanced Players by David Sklansky."
1,A way of life,This is real garbage - the redundancy is maddening. PLUS I don't care for mixing Religion with LAW. Hardly worth burning.
3,The new Dynamic Duo?,"The idea of a Batgirl and Robin teamup is always exciting. Whether its Dick, Jason, Tim, Damien, Barbra, Cassandra, or Stephanie. No matter the incarnation of this duo its bound to be interesting. While that's true here, I liked the Batgirl issues much better. While I enjoyed Cassandra much better before she could speak, her learning how to be a somewhat normal person is still intriguing. Tim's actions and proclamations didn't seem to match up and the art by Damion Scott in the Robin issues was inconsistent to say the least. Overall, this was decent book but uneven."
1,A horrible book!,"The art was ok and the writing was ok... however the plot was pathetic!!! It was one of the worst crafted books I have ever read. Batgirl and Robin fight to the ""death"" to get out of being trapped by the Penguin. Which while not very clever wasn't dumb... but then Robin shoots Batgirl supposedly in a non-vital area... err... what? After he shoots her they both leap up and fight there way to freedom. What? Why didn't you just do that in the firstplace? There wasn't any reason and now Batgirl has a sucking chest wound as they escape. They have officially run out of ideas and instead of trying to come up with something clever they decided to come up with something stupid. Like a mystery novel where the end solution had nothing to do with what happened in the book... if you like trite simple stories or are suffering from major brain damage this is a plot that you can really wrap your mind around. Otherwise... avoid this book like the plague."
3,Pretty good,"I thought that the book was really interesting how it went about explaining Batgirl's handicap with books. I know that Robin is younger than her, but at the end of the book they should've kissed. They were physically really close to eachother, they really should've kissed. Most of the pictures were good, but when they showed Robin's dad and girlfriends, that was messed up. I didn't like the drawer's style.My opinion."
1,Dont Buy It,"First, in the cover of the book is written ""Complete song transcriptions"" well if you don't know how to read music, you don't have a point of reference to know how the music is, rhythm, tempo, etc, because the songs aren't in the cd. Second this book is too easy and boring, it's not worth while buyng it, take my word, the book is too compact."
3,Very good book for second grade girls,"This book was read to me by my second grade daughter. It is certainly one of the better Cam Jansen books. It was a little bit less predictable than some of the other Cam Jansen stories. I would recommend this book to second and third graders, but children older than 3rd grade for the most part would probably think the book is too childish."
4,Cam and the monkeys,"I think kids will like this book, because when the monkeys were gone it took many time to find the monkeys, and there were some clues, and there are adventures. I think it is interesting. At end of story, there was the thief, and he went to jail. And that time when the truck was almost going, Cam stopped that truck, and looked in the back, that was my favorite thing and I think kids will like it.by Soo-Hwan"
4,Everything in One Book,"This is one book you can have on the shelf that concisely describes the fundamentals of raising money. Lant gives clear guidance and useful examples for producing fundraising materials: from letters to full campaign packages. All practical and effective. A good place to start if you are raising money for your favorite cause, or are employing a professional fundraiser."
5,Must have for any MH fan,"Machine Head have been known for their live show. Even though most bands claim that is their fortay, when it comes to MH - they really mean it. This cd is a perfect example of why they have gained such notority over the years. They mix in the old with the new and blend them both together with their patented live style. If you have liked MH at any point in time, this cd is a must have! You can't make a better live cd!!"
5,One of the best live albums ever!,"They say the mark of a good band is when they sound better live than on record. Machine Head - Hellalive is a perfect example of that. Songs from the slightly overproduced Burning Red album feel much more loose and free and sit nicely along side classics such as Old, Ten Ton Hammer and Davidian. But the highlight of this album is by far the song 'Crashing Around You' given a brilliant haunting intro by Robb Flynn, the song takes on a whole new life and will always be the preferred version to go to for all MH fans."
3,Not a believer yet,"First let me mention that this is NOT a religious magazine! Two book stores in my area mistakenly had it with the ""Spirituality"" periodicals. That made it harder to find. The person who named the magazine was remarkably stupid or thoughtless. I picked up an issue because of the Eggers-McSweeney's connection, but I found it to be less interesting than McSwee's, and pretty overpriced for what the modest content provides. The Believer lacks McSweeney's creative spirit and unique and memorable stories. With the next issue featuring articles about Mishima and Walker Percy, I can tell you I'll be skipping that one."
2,Boring!,"I'm sorry to say that this book did little to keep my attention. The men are all depicted as super loving, super sensitive, obedient robots. The story line is also very boring and not much happens. I tried to keep reading it but couldn't get more than half way through it. The descriptions of the surroundings while the heroine was traveling was the most interesting part of the book! Read this book only if you need something to put you to sleep!"
5,Shaker Furniture,"Book is a great Encylopedia of Shaker Furniture, I was looking for more details and working plans, because I was interested in replicating some pieces. I did replicate a few Items in the book."
3,It serves the purpose,"I liked the color arrangement that was shown and that I ordered, but that wasn't what arrived. It was okay, but I wouldn't have ordered it and it was too late to return as my son was starting school."
3,Too Small,This ring is pretty but smaller than I expected it to be. The vendor should include dimensions. I won't buy jewelry online again unless the size/length of an item is indicated. This is the second time I've given the same review of this product. Don't know what happened to the first.
3,Pretty good,"A must-have if you're aiming for the big ones.This is more a collection of articles than a complete book, making it sometimes repetitive and not very structured. Overall not the most pleasant reading but a lot of useful information inside.Tight lines!"
3,Not As Good As Previous Models,This is my third Screwpull. The model I just bought is cheaply boxed and does not work as well as previous models.
1,never received,I cannot review this item as it was never received. Due to long back order the item was cancelled.
1,Cheap Junk,"This can opener worked fairly well when brand new, but the cutting performance quickly deteriorated. It is now more than a year old and simply will not open a can. The removable cutting assembly has frozen up and does not puncture or cut the can. This product is a waste of money at any price."
3,Interesting,"The book was fairly interesting, it did have thrilling moments. However, it was not one of the books that left me feeling a bit of remorse that it was all over as some that I've read recently."
2,Novelization of the film.,"This novelization, like most, is more detailed and oriented to an older crowd than the movie.This story is a staple of the whole Fantasy/D&D genre."
4,Buy the book -- not the audiobook,"This author has much to say, but the limitations of a 2-cassette abridgment make it difficult to learn much from this audiobook. Consequently, it is just an introduction, an overview, and lacks enough concrete examples to make significant changes to your teaching.Still, because I know there is much value here, I would recommend that either you buy the book instead of the audiobook or try the audiobook first and then read the book.Not to say I agree with everything here. The suggestion to improve teaching calculus to girls with journaling is laughable. I do notice that when I was teaching algebra to girls, it helped if I said the equations in plain speech; that is, instead of saying y=x, I said y is the same as x, and the light dawned.As for the reader, I recognized the dulcet tones of Jonathan Marosz immediately. He must have to use an alias when he records for different publishers. He does an excellent job, and his voice carries a lot of authority."
4,The perfect gift for an educator.,"If you know an inovative teacher who tries new startegies to reach all students this book is the perfect gift. Michael Gurian describes how 'brain based research' has been combined with practical teaching, mentoring, and parenting techniques and applied in classrooms over a two year period in Missouri. Chapters 1 and 2 clearly describe how male and female brains differ depending upon hormonal, biological, developmental, and structual change. Once this premise is accepted, practical techniques for educating both boys and girls within the ultimate classroom are explained complete with documented annecdotes. Chapters 4-6 delve into specific grade levels from pre-school through high school graduation. Yes, boys and girls learn differently. Yes, we can use this difference to our and their benefit. An educator will enjoy reading this very practical book."
1,can't educate by sterotyping,"How can our children be best educated if behavior andlearning styles are sterotyped? No! It's impossible to educate with narrow minded beliefs about our sons and daughters.I home school and my kids do not fit the patterns Guriansets out as ""normal"" In the mix of individuals I have as students,it evens out.Gurian is preachy and arrogant in his views.I have the feeling if you don't believe him then you're less informed or educatedthan he is.Wrong!And the 'bridge brain' is only a disclaimer.Of course you willfind exceptions to his rules,it's called indivdual talent!I can't tell you how many girls I've taught learn by doing.Just as many boys are sitting still and reading.Gurian's books are dangerous to our society.He is selling anidea which will keep children in shackles.Gurian's writings have nothing to do with day to day real life.They have everything to do with sexism and keeping young womenin low paying jobs,self hate and low self esteem."
1,"Hey! Why don't we go to a teacher when we're sick, too.","This guy needs to stop flattering himself. He isn't controversial or innovative. He is merely stupid.The idea that some education or pysch major is going to have something important to say about biology is laughable. It is clear he didn't take (because he couldn't pass) Biology 101. Kind of goes against he's theories doesn't it.I (a physician) found his references to hormones and neuroanatomy comical. A failing pre-med knows more than he does! He states something about the hormones maturing faster in girls. Well, last time I checked, the structure of various hormones was constant. The hormones themselves don't change a bit. No one who had the slightest inkling of what they were talking about would refer to this is such terms.This guy is just projecting his social agenda on a bunch of biological terms he doesn't understand. The only people who would fall for this are those who a)know less than he does and b) have the same agenda."
5,Sturdy!,"I ordered two of these expanding files, and I could not be happier with my purchase. The files are very sturdy, and I have them stuffed with documents! I will be ordering more of these in the future, as they are great for organizing everything from school documents to thick product manuals."
4,Great for organizing bills and receipts,"I have very limited space, and I love these, I have 2 of them I use one for receipts and one for bills they keep me very organized and take up very limited space and they keep expanding which is nice. They are very sturdy and give you the option to label, I will probably order several more of these to keep paper work in my office more organized."
4,Pretty and functional!,"I love the color and am very happy it came with the month labels to insert on the tabs. There's plenty of room in each of the 12 compartments. They are open at the bottom though, so don't put anything in that will go underneath the separations. I use it for receipts and I'm well satisfied. The only thing I wish is that the cover flap would lay down when I have it open."
4,smead utracolor expanding file,very stiff plastic is hard to open and put your papers into. appears to be recycled plastic or just to stiff. but they are cheap and who wants to spend a ton on a cheap folder. carl
3,Meh,"Thought it was alright. Certainly better books out there to be reading. I would have prefered a little more daring, and danger, than what was provided."
5,Lye's 2nd CD,"I am in ""awe""! This artist is likened to a ""street poet"", he captures the essence of urban life in his music. It's great having an artist sing of the life we live as opposed to ""talking"" it, and so vividly depicting the major aspects."
2,not as good as the first,Lyfe is a black man trying to do something positive but this CD can't touch his first. He used up all of the clever topics on his debut CD 268-192. This CD was bland. He appears to have softened up lyrically and as a person. The interludes were not amusing. He can really sing though!
5,The Phoenix Rises Again!!!,"Lyfe has done it again!!!! It is so good to know that real talent still exist. I have to say that I am very disappointed that the music industry seems to be sleeping on this musical genius. Lyfe is bringing life back to music!! My favorite cut on the cd is The River,it reminds me of the old classic Sam Cooke song It's Been A Long Time Coming. My other favorites are Let's stay together and I'll always love you. I applaud the fact that his songs are about real life struggles and relationships and that turning your life around is possible. If you have not seen this man in concert you are missing out on a wonderful experience."
2,Honesty works...,"I have to be honest. I loved Lyfe's first cd. And I hate to be a sour apple in the midst of all these good reviews. But honestly? I feel that compared to the first album, ""The Phoenix"" was immensely over-produced. I felt that the soul was gone.I know how I feel about P. Did- wait, sorry. Diddy. I know how I feel about Diddy. I think I feel the same way about ""The Phoenix"".But that boy loves to talk."
2,it's ok,"Lyfe Jennings has talent as a Instrumentalist&Songwriter. vocally is where I can take or leave him. much of this Album reminds me of his debut. now ""S.E.X"" is a cool track,but way too many Interludes(Janet Jackson has the same Problem)and the balance of the album starts to lose me after a while.He kinda reminds me of Anthony Hamilton in that he knows his lane&stays within that base. I'd like to hear him expand more in terms of the music&whatnot,but he is Ok."
3,NOT AS IMPRESSED,"I thought the album was decent, nice lyrics...But honestly I didnt think it was that great. I wasnt impressed with beats and melodies. The slow songs are nice, the stand out tracks are SEX, Down here, Up there, and Lets Stay Together. His first album 268-192, I would give 5+ stars and recommend everyone pick up, I LUV that CD. I think this was just the sophomore curse, so I'm sure his third album will off the hook just like the first."
5,Great addition!,This sets serving plate and serving bowl is perfect sized for a generous serving of food. The creamer and covered container are also well sized. Great finish to the set!
5,"Historical background of the book, from the text itself","It is a combination of two singular manuscripts. There are two poetic variations: alliterative and stanzaic. The first manuscript (alliterative) is known as the ""Thornton Manuscript,"" which is found in the Lincoln Cathedral in York, England. This manuscript draws on various works, including Monmouth's ""History of the Kings of Britain. The second stanzaic version is simply known as MS Harleian 2252. According to the book, this version takes from a piece of French prose ""Mort Artu"".The poems are very descriptive. The first poem pays attention to every historic detail. The second poem is more romantic than anything else. I would definitely suggest putting it in your King Arthur book collection."
2,Skip this one,"While not a worthless read, it wasn't what I thought it would be. The book is written as a very basic outline to the bench press, a personal account that basically says ""this program worked for me, take my advice"".While I bet the program may work, it does not follow traditional and time-tested means of increasing strength. I dont feel like this book helped me with my bench press but it's a good addition to my weightlifting library"
2,Poorly done book,"Hi. I am not interested at all in this book. Richard Butz is talented, but his books are generally not clear at all. I would highly recommend Scandinavian Woodcarving. While the title may be a turn-off, this book is just for fun carving. Check it out!"
3,*OKAY*,"This was okay. I wish Susan Johnson would stick to historical erotic romance. This is hot, good sex, a little hokey. Not my favorite. Light read, quick read. Hope this helps."
5,Very touching,"Before I say anything, I must say that I'm a big fan of Gackt. Well, not so much of a so-called ""fangirl."" I simply find his musical style and his character very appealing. He has a great voice, has talent, and also has a mind to think and a heart to feel. I probably can't ask for more than that.Now for the review part. It's simply very touching, especially ""Tsuki no Uta."" It holds a very strong emotion within its melody and lyrics. It doesn't have so much ""rock"" in it, but it's just as stunning and can convey a lot of emotions as any other his songs would do. The melody line and the lyrics are absolutely beautiful.If you are his fan, you really should get this.If you are not his fan, but would like to listen to a very touching piece, go ahead and get this.I personally believe that certain art pieces would impact people for their lives. And this one may affect you in such way."
4,An Understated Gem,"I liked this movie. The filming was beautiful. The strumming acoustic guitar soundtrack was perfect. And the story was interesting! It's genius was in how un-decorated by popular stereotypes the characters in this movie went about their business. The dialogue was interesting and (mostly) believable. The only thing I had kind of a hard time believing was the relationship between the kid at the factory and the older lady. We were given no reason for her devotion to him. It didn't feel like it was reciprocated on his part - we know she likes him - but why?Still, this movie is well worth the watch. I give it an A-. Very refreshing."
3,Underwhelming,"I was actually a bit disappointed in this film. The writing was not as intelligent as I was expecting. There also seemed to be alot of pointless dialogue. Although the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the inexperience of the actors definitely took away from the film as a whole...probably the reason for the dialogue overkill. The music was also annoying and distracting at parts. This is a very short movie as well. I was genuinely suprised when it ended. I think with some minor adjustments and a bit of editing ""Bubble"" would have worked very well as a short film. It is worth a rental, however."
1,"cool cover, but that's where it ends","Who ever give this piece of junk 5 stars must be either smoking weeds or is taking money from the director. The whole plot can be summarized in three things: 1. Martha and Kyle are friends. 2. Rose moved in, and Kyly liked Rose. 3. Martha killed Rose caused she thought Rose was taking advantage of her.Man, I want my 2 hours back. I could have give this a -1 star if Amazon would let me.Stay away, you have been warned!"
1,"It's not a Movie, It's a Joke","Some reviewers have praised Bubble as an experiment in ""minimalist cinema."" HA!! Bubble is not a movie, it is a joke. It is the kind of joke that Andy Kaufman perfected, where the joke is on the audience. When the audience was expecting comedy Andy Kaufman would read from The Great Gatsby, or sing 99 Bottles of Beer On The Wall. This is that kind of joke, where hindsight makes you laugh at yourself for being such a fool as to sit there expecting something more.Soderbergh and everyone else who is in on this joke are laughing at you if you paid money to watch this tedious, home-video with bad lighting, totally devoid of any drama, humor, or energy. The acting is of course totally amateur, but that would have been forgivable if there was anything resembling a story. Technically, Bubble resembles a college student film, but I have seen many student films that are more memorable, more inventive, and more interesting than this ""experiment."""
1,Disappointing (Spoiler),"I imagined the film to be intriguing. This movie had absolutely nothing to it, except for the real life feel. Personally I liked the unknown actors in this film, but couldn't there have been some kind of interesting plot twist? Something? All we got was what we expected. Martha kills Rose. You expect that from the beginning. I was waiting for something interesting to happen. But it never did."
1,Prison rape would be more enjoyable than watching this film!,Soderberg obviously wants to quickly complete his deal with HDnet and is handing over slop in the name of art. Poor concept with poorer completion. Don't wast your time or money.
5,"dark, slow, moody, amazing film","If you're looking for a blockbuster with exploding cars and crashing trucks, this ain't it. Bubble is a simple, understated, moody film that spins itself slowly into greater and greater complexity. Using non-actors, Soderbergh manages to pull realistic and revealing performances and create an overall subtle but suspenseful mood. This film is all in the nuances. Take a deep breath, sit back, and let this film flow by and amaze you.This film also stands as a shining example of the filmic possibilities opened up by new technologies, not in terms of the flashy special effects we're constantly bombarded with, but in terms of being able to take a high def digital camera and, using available lighting, create a beautiful professional looking film. Every budding director should see this film and open their minds and eyes to what can be done with very little equipment and a big dose of talent."
1,dvd arrived in unwatchable condition,I would review this movie but it arrived in a broken case and the dvd was scratched beyond recognition. It stopped playing within the first 5 minutes because of the damage.
4,Live Zero Pumps Robert Hunter New Songs,"Zero's pinnacle moment in the late 90's just after Jerry Garcia died. This was one of the last shows Pete Sears played with the band and one of the only that the late John Kahn played with them. Set in the historic Great American Music Hall, Zero showcased Robert Hunter's new songs sung by Judge Murphy. Steve Kimmock grew into a star and Martin Fiero displayed his distinct saxophone style."
4,Overlooked Treasure,"This is the better of the two Zero albums currently available. Recorded in 1992, it sounds fresh and classic, unlike so much from that era (Grunge, Modern Rock). Even being selective about it, there's 6 songs for 50 minutes of great music here. Might be the best live album I have. Best song: the instrumental ""Forever is Nowhere"". Well-composed and well-played, there's great guitar (Steve Kimock, whose still around) keyboards/piano and sax found here."
3,a little touchy,you have to hang this slowly and just right or lose the water. not good for me only being able to use one hand.but still a great buy.
2,Remembering Anthony,"""The Story"" is an excellent may to remember Anthony Burger. He passed while serving as the house pianist on a Bill Gaither Homecoming Cruise February 22, 2006. This CD contentrates on piano only. No voices and no instrumental backup. Pure Anthony Burger."
3,So-so,I was excited for this book but became disappointed as I continued to read. It seemed a little tedious and not quite as funny as I expected.
4,Hilarious!,"Cheryl Peck's used to getting the short stick - she grew up overweight, unpopular and the eldest of five children (her parents' ""test child,"" as she dubs it).This collection of short essays -- vignettes, if you will -- take readers from Peck's childhood memories to adulthood, working in Social Services and spending time with her Beloved and her adored narcissistic cat Babycakes. (Several stories, in fact, are told in Babycakes' viewpoint.) Peck especially focuses upon growing up as one of three stairstep girls (she refers to youngest sister as the Wee One and the middle sister as the UnWee), and relates a number of opinions and experiences from her lesbian viewpoint.Peck is a talented storyteller, and it's hard not to relate to her! Give this collection a try, and you're bound to laugh, ponder life and go through a gamut of other emotions, all at the same time."
1,Not as it appears,"Online this looks white and crisp. In person, it is yellow and faded. A total disappointment, and was returned for a refund. The shipping method used to receive and return the product was awkward and inconvenient, too! (Not shipped via regular shippers like FedEx or UPS.)"
2,Zig zags and goes off focus,"I love Zig. He is wise, energetic and an innovator in the world of motivational speaking. However, while there are nuggets of wisdom in this CD, he goes off topic and brings in irrelevant anecdotes, such as an overly long description of how he lost weight and the tribulations of a child with a debilitating illness. Unless you can get the CD for an extremely low price (less than $5.00 USD), I recommend you steer clear of this one."
1,Total waste of money,Don't waste your money on this audio CD.Instead buy the textbook.This audio is worth USD 1.5$
3,Decent rethoric,I heard Zig speak and he has good sense of humour and he seems pretty positive. A good way to lift your spirits a bit when you are driving. Sound like a good ole advice.
5,Love it.,Zig Ziglar is a great motivational speaker. He has good advice that is timeless and I would recommend this to all.
2,I got lost in all the stories!,"This is my first Zig Ziglar audio and it is just not my cup of tea. He is a good southern storyteller but telling the stories got in the way of making his points. I listened to it 3 times and I still don't know the points he was trying to make! He finishes the audio by saying that God wants everyone to succeed and then says ""see you at the top""!"
4,Keep up the good work,"I have not been able to review all the DVD's but so far everything is GREAT, I have not complaints."
4,ER,I bought it for friend during christmas. She made me watch it and I got back into watching the last season. The DVDs were great. If you are a fan then you need the third season of ER.
4,Why the long wait?,"I love this show and am eager to purchase all seasons as they come out on DVD. My only question/concern is, why does it take so long between seasons? It has been more than 6 months, if not closer to a year when season 2 came out. Other TV show's seasons come out more quickly between seasons. Anybody have any answers?"
5,book of the year!,This is by far the most original book I have EVER come across. A great gift for anyone who has feelings towards these wonderful creatures....
4,A gift for Charlie,"A well-appreciated gift for my nephew,Charlie who is both a cat lover and an artist."
3,Look for the original edition,"I had only seen the original edition of this book which is a full sized binding suitable for coffee table display. I was disappointed at what arrived, this pocket-sized version. Much of the best material has been edited out and of course the photos are now bite-sized. If you can, look for the original publication which is much more funny and looks like an actual non-fiction publication. The tiny version looks like a cute gag - which is what it has been reduced to."
5,The willing suspension of disbelief,"It's all real, I tell you. I have read this book cover to cover, every word, a hundred times over, and have never tired. In fact, I rather resent being told all the time that this marvelous document is little more than a poke in the ribs of art critism. I am CHOOSING to believe that it is true, and I take it very seriously. I refuse to acknowledge any evidence suggesting that cats might NOT paint. I even plan to personally visit the Museum of Non-Primate Art this year. I highly recommend this book to anyone who, like myself, both wishes to expand his or her view of art and is gullible."
4,A beautiful book!,"I grabbed this book because about 5 years ago I was told about it, and it sounded amazing. As a cat lover, I love anything on cats (of course), and have a wide range of cat and kitten books. This is a different and unusual book. I am SO glad I got it. I am absolutely amazed with the photographs. I have to admit I haven't read it cover to cover yet, I'm still wrapped up in the pictures, but from what I have read, it's beautifully written. This is a musthave for catlovers. A wonderful, brilliant and splendid book!8/10"
4,Cat Painting Book,"It's an OK book, but I didn't realize I was buying a hardback, small, condensed version. I wanted the larger paperback version. But the seller was good to deal with and the book was delivered quickly."
1,LIARS,"This sellers website, on Amazon, shows a photo of a woman reading a large (coffee table) size book. This seller is actually selling a book that is 4""x5"". This seller offers deceptive selling practices (lies) and takes almost one month to ship their tiny books. This is dishonest. I wrote the seller and they replied:Your refund will not include the original shipping cost plus there will be an additional deduction of 15% off the original price of the item for a restocking fee. Should we incur any return shipping cost for the item you will not be refunded for these charges. Also should you incur return shipping charges you will not be reimbursed.So I was lied to, I missed the date to give the gift and now I must pay to return the books they lied about. This seller should be kicked off Amazon.Louise"
5,An exquisite addition to the wonders of the feline world!,"I have been involved with cats since I was born especially being the only child - they were my family along with animals in general. This book is a delight to read and I often bring it out and wonder at the pictures and accounts of the feline artists. I love to paint myself and often turn to it to escape from the stress of working in the animal shelter environment. One day one of my cats, named Romeo, wandered over and started playing in my paints. Normally I would have shooed him away but this book opened my eyes to the depth of our whiskered pals. I allowed him to play with the paint (non-toxic) and he promptly patted the red paint and touched me leaving what looked like little paw hearts all over my arm. It totally thrilled me and now all 8 of my cats enjoy the pastime of liquid colors. This book was so very enjoyable and eye-opening that I reccomend it to all animal lovers alike!! Lesa Sweet -- AeonGal2@aol.co"
4,"Fun ""art appreciation"" book","This is a fun book for art lovers of all ages. Adults will appreciate the humor, children will enjoy the pictures of the cats painting. There are lots of colorful photos of the cats painting and finished ""artworks""."
4,An exceptional piece of mystical beauty,"This is a 40+ min. live recording of the mysterious Japanese underground icon at work. The uninitiated will find it abrasive and weird but to those who know, it's breathtaking. Subtle and emotive, harsh and chaotic, Haino's improvised electric guitar maulings command attention the entire recording; there is no time to get lost in the rhythm or melody because there is none...just the tortured beauty of a true artist. Very heavy."
5,provides a practical explanation to get to enlightenment,An enlightenment is a liberation and a true cessation. this book help as how to know the correct path. examples of the this path are thouse stages of the path that lead to liberation and enlightenment. Also we can learn a short practice consisting of prayers for the six preparatory practices.
5,Unbelievably helpful!,"We'd taken a Bradley class with my first baby and it didn't do much for me. I got this for my second and what a huge difference! I used so many things she teaches on the DVD-breathing, different poses, movement. The last hour before I started pushing was me moving my hips with my husband massaging my back-and I'm convinced that's why it only took 2 pushes for my son to be born. Rocki really seems to know alot about childbirth and her techniques helped me immeasurably. Great DVD. (I feel the same way about the next one in the series-Labor Prep 3.)"
4,"Good material, but short","This isn't so much as a workout video as it is an instructional video. This is really a guide for how to accomplish workouts. I think there is decent material in this video for methods that can be used for easing the labor process, but I think that the video is a bit short. In fact, I see no reason that Volume 2 and 3 could not be on the same disc. For that reason, I can't give this a higher rating. If this disc had been arranged in such a way that workout parts could be accomplished, then it would be fully worth it, but noting that all it does is explain the various positions and does not go through as a ""workout video"", it falls short of its purpose."
4,"Excellent book, but not student-friendly!","Dr. Poor is a very well known authority in statistical signal processing, and in this book he offers us an excellent introductory-level presentation on a challenging and very important subject. Careful reading of this book will provide the reader with a solid theoretical background!Lots of examples and exercises to illustrate theory; nevertheless I think that some very important aspects related to practical applications should not be left as exercises (for instance M-ary hypothesis testing). I also missed some computer-based exercises; it would have been great to see the beauty of detection and estimation theory at work.If you have some familiarity with the topic you will undoubtedly enjoy this book, but if you are a student tackling with this for the first time it will be demanding reading. You will need considerable fluency in random variable calculus to get the most out of the book, as the author presents many results and derivations as ""straightforward""."
1,Hardly an introduction,"This book seems to be the standard detection and estimation text (it was used in a graduate-level EE course at my university). This is unfortunate as it's a pretty bad book. While the author is obviously knowledgeable about the subject matter, the writing is terse and unenlightening. There are many leaps taken with little explanation and lots of assumption. Although this is probably a decent reference book for those already familiar with detection and estimation theory, it makes an extremely poor choice for a class."
4,Best Book I've Seen but could be better,Poor does a better than average job of explaining the complicated theory behind detection and estimation. He has many examples which clarifiy some complicated theorems. However I find that too many steps are skipped. Particularly in chapter II where the basis for all of the detection methods become apparent.The book is an excellent resource for someone who wants to learn detection and estimation. However don't expect it to be your only resource. In order to understand Poor's book to its fullest you will need to find supplemental material.
5,Something for Everyone,"I'm a jazz pianist. All the musicians I know who have read this book think highly of it, and I'm no exception.It doesn't pretend to be an encyclopedia of everything jazz. It's a study of the nature of jazz improvisation, based upon the author's own experience as a trumpet player and his interviews with (then) living jazz musicians about their personal experiences and recollections.The ""story"" is an enlightening one, even to someone like me, who has been a musician for a half century and met some of the people in the book. For jazz lovers and people who just want some insight into this wondrous genre, it's an absorbing read.For practicing musicians, music students, and anyone else who knows at least some music theory, it's invaluable for its many detailed musical examples, the like of which I've seen nowhere else in any publication.There's something in this book for everyone who wants to know more about the creative process in jazz."
5,Naughty,Loved it! Arm holes are a little tight but beyond that it was great. Just the right amount of coverage on the top. Skirt is a good length not too long or too short. Panties have elastic around legs that have that old fashioned feel about them that makes you feel so naughty
4,comprehensive yet sometimes cumbersome,"This book is a very good guide for mushroom hunters. The pictures are accurate, and the descriptions are thourogh. It give some good comments on many of the mushrooms, and the reader becomes better educated. One of the problems with the book is that it can be very difficult to identify a particular mushroom. This, I feel, is due to the layout of the book. We are instructed to find the mushroom through a series of sillouhettes that match what it appears to be. There are many mushrooms that look alike, but grow in vastly different climates, areas and situations. If the book were to separate the mushrooms according to this criteria, it is possible that it would be easier to find a particular mushroom. The book provides information on the edibility of the mushrooms. It may be improved if the edible murooms were flagged in the picture section as the poisonous ones are."
2,Learning Mushrooms,"This book is filled with information which must be read very carefully, it is not a book so much for beginners as for more advanced hunters. Has some good pictures, but the print is very small and hard to read, as it is gray on a white background. I had to get my magnifying glass to read some portions. If the type was black and just a little larger, it would be easier."
2,the one i have is better,"At the factory the page cutter cut off half the page numbers, also the Icon that tells if the mushrooms are poisen or not so you have to look for them in the back"
4,Good reference,I chose this guide as it is recommended on many of the mushroom foraging sites as a valuable tool to correctly identify fungi. It has many excellent features such as grouping 'look a like' fungi pictures together so you can fairly quickly identify what added research you may need. The reference between the pictures and the text is good but it would be helpful if when another mushroom is referenced a page reference was included. Detail on the referenced fungi can usually be found but it's a little awkward. Harvesting mushrooms has a level of risk so a good source such as this coupled with other reliable information sources is crucial. The book lives up to its billing and I'm glad I have it. For those starting out I'd recommend this plus wikipedia and probably some other sources as mistakes must be avoided.
2,Not useful,"Most mushrooms are notoriously difficult to identify. It often takes the experience of an expert along with DNA analysis to put definite names on even the common species. And don't expect to identify very many mushrooms using this book. I decided to get rid of my copy, because it was only good for gathering dust in the bookcase."
3,Less than stellar,I was disappointed to find that there was no useful information contained therein. While the pictures were very well done there were no colloquial names to help identify species.
2,Book was brand new,The book was brand new. However the shipping took FOREVER. I did email the seller. No response until I emailed again. SLOW.
1,poor condition,"the content was fine, but this ""NEW"" copy purchased through Amazon was not in excellent condition. Perhaps poor storage or exposure to damp. The pages were rippled, the spine was not crisp"
2,Get Mushrooms Demystified,"Most people buy this book simply because it is an Audubon Society book. (I made this mistake) It seems the author left out important information in an attempt to keep the book field guide sized. By including a few species from every part of the country, the author made this book of little use to anyone who lives in one place. On the other hand, it does have a lot of pictures... Even if they are small, hopelessly jumbled, and labeled with made-up names. (seriously) This book is for people that have some spare money and want to expand their library. I would highly recommend a couple of other books instead: Mushrooms Demystified (The comprehensive text for beginners and experts alike), and All the Rain Promises and More (The field guide)."
2,very disappointed,I was hoping to identify at least a few of the 11 different mushrooms in my garden. Unfortunately not a single one is shown in the picture plates. I am now in search of a better book.
5,Love this guide!,"I so love this guide. It is so easy to find exactly the fungi or mushroom I am trying to identify. The condition was excellent, even though it is used, and the price was good, the shipping quick."
4,shroons,I have found and identified several types of mushrooms with this book and eaten several. excellent resource! pictures are clear and descriptions detailed.
5,"Audubon Society's ""Mushrooms""","Book was highly informative and served the purpose for which it was bought very well. It enabled me to identify the mushrooms that began growing in my lawn, and told me they were poisonous."
5,crazycaz diggs this one!!!!!!!!!!,"supa dave at his best. this is a damn hot mix cd!!!it's not only the tracks featured on this cd but here is someone who has great mixing skills.it's not where you put your cuts it's where you dont!i really like tracks like the pledge w rob swift and dj quest or keep steppin with slug and mondee are just great tracks and there is more to find on this album.basically i would say , if you dont dig this one, then don't call yourseld a hiphop head. aaiiight!!i ggot to give it up for supa dave , this is what cats been waiting for ...crazycaz"
3,"A fun read, but not much else to say; fluff.","Theodore Sturgeons' interesting ""The Dreaming Jewels"": What must have come off as cutting edge back in the 1950s plays rather clunky and awkward at times here; we can picture Sturgeon under the gun to push out a contractual obligation, leaving us with barely explored characters (at times, completely unexplored) and a storyline that could have really reached for the reader's sympathy, had he slowed the plot down just a touch. Fun to read, though, and I'll probably read at least one more of his works before judging him too harshly."
3,juvenile style without complexity,"I've only read one book by Sturgeon before and it was his collection of short stories in the book Starshine. I thought the 6 stories were ""partly juvenile stories with no depth."" My expectations of Dreaming Jewels were heightened due to some rather pleasant reviews. However, Dreaming Jewels followed the same juvenile ideas and/or writing style of the stories in Starshine. I'm not even sure if one could classify this into the genre of SF. If Sturgeon hadn't throw in some big science words, this book definitely would have been classed as fantasy. Carnies don't belong in sci-fi! Further, the plot twists are placed in predictable places in the story while the dialogue is simple and dry."
4,Keep it simple,"I haven't read the whole book yet, but so far it seems good, it has a cientific and medical aproach that pleases me and it explains each theme in a very simple way, and I think every singer and singing theacher should read it."
4,Just one little thing missing,"Everyone who has read this book will agree it's full of valuable information for teachers with practical solutions for some tetchy vocal problems. There's only one thing missing. Nowhere does the author go into detail about the ever prevailing problem of pitch correction. In all of these singing manuals I've read, none of them have addressed this problem other than to suggest warm ups before the lesson and the occasional scale practise. The reality is very different however and correcting pitch problems, no matter how small, is an area which is sorely neglected in vocal tutorials. Most people with pitch problems don't respond well to echoing pitching and interval drilling. If they did, they wouldn't have a pitch problem. This book has everything covered off beautifully, except for this one. Sadly we need to keep searching the shelves to find the solution."
5,Love this book!,"This was a perfect idea for a gift for my husband. He teaches vocal students and is always looking for ways to teach technique and to help them with a variety of vocal issues. When I saw this I thought that it was not only useful, but something he'll enjoy reading."
5,A Good Reference for the Vocal Studio Bookcase,"While I presume that most voice teachers will not find a great deal of new material here, this book is an excellent resource for quick reference. The information is factual and clear, without a great deal of opinion. The book divides vocal faults into various categories, faults related to: Posture; Breathing and Support; Phonation; Registration; Classification; Resonation; Articulation; Speaking Voice; Coordination. Although the focus on faults may appear to be a negative approach, the book is intended for teachers, not students. Highly recommended (for teachers) - this is a book my bookcase wouldn't be without."
2,Woth buying but...,"This is one of the best books on vocal pedagogy ever written. I just got this edition in order to have the CD which I hadn't purchased with the first edition I had bought. The CD pinpoints vocal faults clearly. However, the sound quality of the recording is LOUSY. And to top it all off, this edition is really a reprint of the 1994 revised issue. So far so good, but the quality of both the paper and the printing is awful: on some pages the printing is REALLY blurry. If you can get the 1994 edition, do it, for it is much easier to read."
5,Joey and Tripp make a great duo,"This cd rocks! The lead singer, Wednesday 13, was in a band similar to Murderdolls called Frankenstein Drag Queens From Planet 13. A couple of the Murderdolls songs are FDQ songs. The music isn't as heavy as Static-X and Slipknot but it's stil great. Good guitar riffs. Interesting lyrics, such as Kill Miss America. In that song he says,""Tonight I'm the prettiest zombie alive. I don't care what it takes to win the prize...I'm gonna Kill Miss America"". Most lyrics are comical horror. I would definitely reccomend buying this cd. The bonus song ""Crash Crash"" is really great. If you like Slipknot, Static-X, Marilyn Manson or even FDQ you should get this cd!"
1,Pretensious BS is too much for this one,"Fuguet should get his shirt together and write his age, let the likes of Kevin Williamson do the teen writing, because here it doesn't work."
3,More like Less Than Zero,"I enjoyed this book and thought it an interesting perspective of a section of chilean youth that was generally ignorant of the brutality going on in that country at the time. I think this novel, and it's main character, to be much closer to Bret Easton Ellis' main character in his novel Less Than Zero, than to the protagonist in Catcher In The Rye. Even the the way the novel is structured and printed is very similar. For those of you who liked this novel you might want to check out Less Than Zero. A fresh perspective on middle/upper class Chilean, and perhaps Latin American youth in general, and their alienation in the eighties."
2,Bad American Masters Copy,"I'm a chilean young. I read ""Mala Onda"", when I was 17, I thinked that so cool. After that, I followed the Fuguet's suggestion about to read ""The Catcher in the Rye"".It's his ""Bad Vives""' inspiration. Can you get something more with Bad Vives? I don't think so... This year, I'm 21, I read Ch. Bukowski. Fuguet is just a bad copy of Salinger and Bukowski. I think he took classes with them to learn to write. (If you have read Salinger or Bukowski it isn't so new) I don't wanna read Fuguet's book anymore. You will know: Salinger+Bukowski ==> Fuguet. But he (Fuguet) will never be like one of them (the american Masters)."
4,The Psychotherapist as Parenting Coordinator,The Psychotherapist As Parent Coordinator in High-Conflict Divorce: Strategies and Techniques (Haworth Practical Practice in Mental Health) (Haworth Practical Practice in Mental Health)This is a great resource for a guidebook for practicing parenting coordinators.
1,Eeeek,Don't get me wrong I'm certainly no (Prog) Rock Fan but please don't buy. Do yourself a favour and purchase the original and if you need dance music buy that.Anybody that would appreciate the original wouldn't buy this remix and dance music fans surely wouldn't but this.I hope Jeff Wayne wasn't involved in this bastardisation of a superb album.
4,flashlight,Pelican Stealth 2400 Flashlight.- I really like the toggle switch. The bulb is very bright. The photoluminescent shroud and its neon color make it easy to locate.
4,brite flashlight,Great Light love the glow in dark shroud. Hang it by my bed to use for intruders. Shines a brite light for a long ways using a LED. Love that it is waterproof also.
5,Still looking good months later,"Gasket looks great, I like that it's blue instead of black like everything else under the hood - makes it a little easier to line up when installing. No sign of leakage or wear."
4,Highly recommended,"This is a very useful resource. It is a little dated, but it covers the more familiar European countries, as well as the Japanese and Americans in Europe. One of the reasons it is so useful is that it gives a socio-politico-economic snapshot of the country."
2,mildly entertaining,It's mildly entertaining and a little out-dated with the tricks for the office. Save your money.
3,Clumsy,"This film attempts to illustrate the cultural differences that exist between Japan, in a work context, and the west. It is at best clumsy and on occassions borders on rascist. It certainly makes no effort to explain the social characteristics it illustrates. It is not really a comedy. It is of interest to somebody who has a knowledge and interest in things Japanese and can see what the director is attempting to do, but I cannot see what appeal it would have to anyone else."
2,Stultifying and painful to watch. Ugh,"This was supposed to be a comedy, but instead it is two hours that alternate between boredom and absurdity.The hero of the story is a well-trained, educated and skilled translator who -- instead of acting like an adult -- allows herself to become the whipping girl of a group of sadistic bosses.If any company like this actually exists in Japan, or anywhere else, I pity the poor workers. But I cannot waste my sympathy on anyone who chooses to stay and put up with the abuse and humiliation like this protagonist does.And frankly, the acting consisted primarily of Sylvie Testud looking either bewildered or blank. Even the ""fantasy"" interludes didn't add interest.A cross cultural workplace may a goldmine of comedic ideas, but this movie didn't manage to emerge with even a single nugget worth watching."
3,"Good Cop, Bad Cop","For me this was a very slow book, It wasn't until chapter thirteen that it became a page turner. Police Inspector Logan Riley , FBI agent Sean Weston dance around each other preteneing to be just friends, when Sean is kidnapped at her stepsisters wedding the families all pull together to save her and to protect the rest of the family. Sean promised to be Logans Cinderella for the rest of her life."
5,When I fall in Love,This book was excellent from beginning to end. A very easy read and beautiful story line that keeps you interested until the end.
2,My least favorite Doc Ford novel so far.,"I am struggling to stay interested in the fourth Doc Ford novel, Captiva. First, I am terribly disappointed in that the whole flavor of the book is somewhat different than the first three. It is almost as if someone else wrote it. The style is so different. Second, the first three books were written consistantly in the ""third person"" genre, while this one (out of the blue) is written in first person ! It is very distracting and disappointing, as I was hooked on Doc Ford after the third book. I was expecting a continuation of the same great style White portrayed in the first three books. I am not going to rush out and get number five."
4,Great,This is the first book I have read by White and want to read more. I also read Sanibal. As a child I had visited both these islands and know they are very different today than they were in the 50's. Will keep reading books by White.
4,Formulaic Florida Fun & Firebombs Featuring Ford,"For those who miss Travis McGee,you can find him here in thisupdated version, Doc Ford. Substitute the west coast of Flafor the east, add Tomlinson (Meyer) and flatboats instead ofhouseboats and you are there! 3rd outing for Doc finds himexploring the fish netting question. He cansee both sides of the issue, but a bomb set off at his marinapulls him into a political/environmental quagmire. Sensitivebabes are not oldstyle McGee bimbos, but independent (or tryingto be) today women. Of course, their life expectancy is veryreduced by friendship with Ford! Excellent comeuppance forthe bad guy, run to ground in Sumatra! CAPTIVA is a very""reader friendly"" novel which should travel well to the beachwhere its great cover art may attract babes or dudes!!!Leaves this reader looking forward to the next Doc Ford."
5,"""What a Book""","I have read all but a couple of Randy Wayne Whites books and think that Captiva is a great book,The best so far. I just got done reading Sanibel Flats and The Heat Islands and thought they they were very exiciting also, but Captiva left you on on the edge of your seat, wondering what is going to happen next. I really enjoy reading about Florida/Key West mysteries. I find them very satisfying."
4,Just barely misses being absolute top grade,"This is the most intense Doc Ford story I've yet read. However, one suspenseful plot thread while undoubtedly effective at the time of publication becomes tiresome to those who have read later books in the series. As far as the resolution of that thread goes...just a bit hard to swallow even considering the character who's involved.Still, I highly recommend this book."
4,Sounds like a polished early 80's Pat Metheny,I found this album my accident and I love it. It reminds me so much of Pat Metheny's melodic pieces it is remarkable. If you like Metheny's works like: Still Life Talking or First Circle you'll like this one as well.
3,I broke it within 10 minutes,"Busted the handle off. It'll work fine if you're not doing heavy duty work, and if you're not impatiently trying to rip out some weeds."
5,Great tool. Definitely recommend.,"This is the first trowel that I've owned that I haven't managed to break. Very sturdy. The handle is comfortable, and it slices nice and easily into the the hard clay we have here locally. Fantastic value for the money."
3,Made in China and comes with a CA toxic warning!,"Was very disappointed to see that the tag said ""CA toxic warning...this product can cause cancer"". WHAT??? So I called Fiskars and they said that they no longer have to put that warning on their labels, that everything is fine, and that Amazon must have old stock. I still am not happy about this as it was to be a stocking stuffer for my gardening daughter. I'd say....buy this at your own risk, regardless of what Fiskar's says. As far as the size ..... yes, it's probably a better, more useful tool than most."
2,Handle Broke Off,"I enjoyed using the big grip trowel before mine broke. The large scoop size was nice and it was comfortable to use. Unfortunately, mine snapped in half where the trowel meets the handle the first year I had it. Wish it were more durable."
4,Serves my needs,"I bought this item because I don't have the time in the morning to wait the recommened 25-30 minutes regular sunscreens call for before going outside. I put this on my face and I'm out the door with instant protection. It does have a bit of a chalky look on the face, but since I wash it off when I get back from my morning exercise and apply a more sheer sunscreen before I go about my daily chores I'm satisfied with it."
1,Did not like sunscreen at all,"I have used other Neutrogena sunscreens, but did not like this sunscreen at all. I originally bought this because it had titanium dioxide, which is one of the top ingredients I heard that blocks the skin cancer causing UVA rays. I regretted the purchase. I found that it was hard to rub into my skin, no matter how hard I rubbed. I have light to medium skin tone and it would make my skin look pasty white. If I perspired or got water on it where I put the sunscreen on, the sunscreen would start to come off and make my skin look even whiter. On a side note, this sunscreen contains three different parabens which has some controversy about it being a carcinogenic."
1,"Leaky -- Very, Very Leaky","We had to return this cup. I purchased it as a Christmas gift for my wife, and she tested it the next day by putting some coffee into the mug. For some reason, the seal didn't, well, *seal* the cup, and hot coffee gushed out from between the rim and the cup itself, thankfully into the sink. She tried re-seating the lid, and checked it for any other issues, but couldn't make it stop leaking.This is a travel mug, and if she'd been trying to use it while driving, it could very easily have been an accident-causing distraction.I've seen fairly high ratings for this mug, which is why I chose it, but we're returning it for a refund, since we want to be able to find one locally that we can check easily, and return without the hassle."
4,Living long ... living well,"There's something oddly fascinating about centenarians ... or at least about the idea of living to a hundred. Part of it is our obvious fascination with round numbers (don't get me started on when the millenium hits) but more than that, these are people who have lived a century. When they were born, cars were a novelty, electricity a rumour and the computer undreamt-of. Unfortunately, even as the idea of living fascinates, it repels, because we see the journey as inevitably leading to physical and mental decay. Heck, the word ""senility"", which comes from the word meaning ""old"" is virtually a synonym for dementia. Just five years ago, a Canadian report suggested mental decline was the inevitable result of living so long. We just aren't cut out to live that long ... and if we do, we'll suffer for it. But do we need to? Not according to this book, which provides a wealth of information about people who have lived to be 100, and who are still fit and functioning."
2,Living to 100,"A good book. Not particularly an interesting read, but it does have some good information in it. I was introduced to it by a show, but it was over rated."
4,A humous pamphlet on Revolutionary soldiers w/Cartoons,"58 pages illus. This pamphlet was taken on my Mr Mauldin in 1974 as a Bicentenial project for the National Park Service. Mr Mauldin intended this to be a Willy & Joe in Three cornered hats. He admits in the text that he was overwhelmed by what he thought he knew of the The Revolution, and what there is to know. He performed extensive research on the subject, and was not able to complete the work until 1978. Mauldin's excellent sense of humor shines throughout the text without sacrificing accuracy (He mentioned several very obscure battles within the text); providing an enjoyable semi-serious look at the life of the common soldier of the Revolutionary War times, while poking some fun at the officers (George Washington does not escape unscathed) Of course the cartoons are irresistable."
4,Language Difference,"This book covers the language difference between minority speakers of English and more mainstream speakers. Focusing on mostly African-Americans, the authors discuss the difficulty students face due to their language use at home and the use of language in the classroom. How to really effectively address this problem is still under discussion but the authors and editors do propose some solutions and describe why students may have trouble when faced with a dialect difference in school. Who's school is it?"
4,Another great book from Lisa Delpit,"As an African American educator I really relate to Lisa Delpit and her struggle to balance, culture with theory and practice."
4,Showing your race/sexual orientation/socioeconomic status/culture by the way you speak.,"An interesting look at differences in language -- accent, vocabulary, and dialect. This book explores the judgements that people, even young children, make when they hear a voice. Well-rounded and very pragmatic about solutions. Doesn't just say 'Oh, people shouldn't judge each other.' Because, like it or not, we do."
4,Helpful.,"I had to read this book for a class on studying diversity. I love books like this, and found it very interesting. I thought that it had some very valuable tips and classroom scenarios that some teachers overlook."
4,Not quite as advertised,"First, let me say I do like these, BUT, they aren't quite what they advertise. The package says ""a delectable medley of exotic vegetables"". Sounds good, I like terra chips w/sweet potatoes, beats, taro and so forth, so these must be the same. Wrong. The back of the package says ingredients: a seasonal mix of root vegetables. But, if you read on the seasonal mix, the delectable medley is only sweet potato & taro. There are several colors of sticks makig you think you're getting several different vegetables, but actually you're getting the same two vegetables, w/some dyed by beet juice. Disappointing."
5,Very good,I have bought these locally but they are hard to find. I just don't want to buy 12 at a time! Why couldn't they at least offer a 6 pack? What is a single person going to do with 12 packs! I prefer these sticks over the regular chips. They are easier to eat.
5,AWESOME!!!!!!,"IF YOU NEED A PICK ME UP,A FRESH PERSPECTIVE ON LIFE OR IF YOU ARE JUST DOWN IN THE DUMPS THIS BOOK WILL IGNITE A FIRE IN YOU,MIKE EVANS IS A LIVING TESTIMONY OF GOD'S FAITHFULNESS AND POWER,WHAT A BOOK,ONCE YOU START READING IT ,IT IS HARD TO PUT DOWN,AND AS A END RESULT OF BEING A BLESSING TO ISRAEL THE WAY HE HAS,I FIND IT TO BE SO TRUE,WHEN YOU TAKE TIME TO BE A BLESSING TO GOD'S CHOSEN PEOPLE THE LORD WILL MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TO MEET YOUR NEEDS!!!!!"
3,Dora,This toy just like Nemo fizzled out for us after it needed replacement batteries. The grandkids loved it while it worked though.
5,Better than DOL--highly recommend,"I have my middle school language arts class do a ""Caught Ya"" twice a week. The majority of my students get very excited about it. I walk around the classroom and they're dying for me to read their papers and hope I don't ""catch them."" I believe that this is a highly effective way to teach grammar, punctuation, spelling, etc. My students are indenting paragraphs, putting punctuation inside quotation marks, and properly capitalizing. I'm loving it! I think that their vocabulary is improving, too."
4,MIddle School caught ya's,"I have used another Caught Ya for several year, but have moved from high school to middle school. I am really enjoying the Caught Ya specifically for middle school. I can tell a difference in my students' writing, especially in the area of punctuation and more varied sentence formation.Sara SherrillHurricane Middle School"
2,Disappointing,"This is the exact same as ""Grammar with a Giggle."" I bought it, looking for a change of pace, but the story was the same one. What a let down. Don't waste your money."
5,Giggle while meeting state core standards,"I have used Jane Kiester's Grammar with a Giggle series for eighteen years in my middle school classroom. Eventhough omniscient bureaucrats love to change curriculum every few years and call it the newest and greatest thing (e.g. Common Core), her program doesn't just meet writing, grammar, and vocabulary, and communication standards, it exceeds them. Thanks, Ms. Kiester (eventhough my students call you the grammar goddess), for the laughs and grammar with rigor."
2,Warning: Not the original versions on this Petula Clark CD,"Warning: The Petula Clark songs on this CD ARE NOT the original recorded versions that became her biggest hits. They are entirely different versions, and sound almost as if they were performed in concert. Think of them as such, even if there is no crowd applause after each song. That is the only way one can appreciate this album. If you truly desire Pet's best stuff, check out her ""Ultimate"" CD instead and pass on this one. You're welcome!"
5,Amazing True Documentation,"People would not believe this story unless they knew it was true. Mr.Michaud and Mr. Anesworth did extensive research to give a astonishing true story of the last heir of the vast empire of Mifflin Kenedy. Sarita falls in love with a monk and as the title reads, ""If You Love Me, You Will Do My Will"" and the Catholic monk did. She left 1/2 of her empire to the ""Kenedy Memorial Foundation"" and the other 1/2 to the Catholic Diocease of Corpus Christi, Texas. The reader would need to know the whole background story to really be understand this truly very intereting book. If you are a history buff of South Texas, this is a must read to understand the whole picture on what when on in the early years and days of the New Texas in the 1800's."
4,A very nice instrumental sampler,"A fabulous recording indeed. HOWEVER, the second track is miscatalogued, and instead of ""Quitapesares"" you'll hear a ""gaita"" (a good one, though, but it breaks the general theme of the CD), and I thought customers should know it if they want to buy this."
5,super cool looking toy!!,"this toy is really nice...looks really cool in the package too....the crawler is actually pretty big, so i definately got my 5 dollars worth!"
3,Salem's Lot to be desired,"I approached this thinking it was one of THE titles by one of the best writers in the genre. Disappointed. It's the same hackneyed vampire yarn in a modern setting. Seen it, read it a dozen or more times. King writes quite well so I finished the book but I was expecting new twists, innovative plot, unusual characters. Oh well, we learn from experience."
2,Great book - LOUSY READER!,"This is a great book - I read it as a little kid when it came out. I listen to dozens of audiobooks each year, and this guy is the second-worst reader I have ever heard (behind the guy who reads the unabridged version of Harris' Red Dragon - what a disaster that was!).All of the characters sound exactly the same to me, with the exception of the 10 year old boy. Of all books to let this guy read, a Stephen King book is probably not the one I would have picked.I know that Frank Muller is out of commission, but couldn't they have found someone else? BAD CHOICE."
3,"Starts off slow, gets better towards the end","Being a big King fan myslef, and hearing other King fans descibe this as his greatest work, I decided to read Salem's Lot. Stephen King+Vampires=Good Book, right? Well, not exactly. The main flaw this novel has is it takes too long for any vampires to show up! It takes half the book before any vampires surface. Before that we have a lame love story and so many characters to try and keep track of that it gets confusing at times. But keep reading! Once you get past the first half of the book, the fun begins as King uses the Vampires. This novel would have been sooooo much better if King would have started things from page one instead of page 230. Salem's Lot is pure King mayham, it just takes a while to get started."
5,King wants to suck your blood,"This is Stephen King's take on the vampire genre, and with it he completely whips Anne Rice's wimpy ""Interview With a Vampire"" series. No pretentious airs of aristocracy with King's vampires. They are mean, bad and on the march in the unfortunate town of Jerusalem's Lot. Their leader, ""The Master,"" doesn't go in for Armani suits. He's bald, ugly and will suck you dry in a nanosecond, in the process turning you against you former friends and neighbors. Overall, this is one of King's absolute best and certainly scariest novels."
5,Excellent - VERY Chilling,"This book was simply excellent. A very gripping and chilling story.The story itself is classic King; slow to develop, but once you get your background the tale will fly by! The writing actually conveys the characters' feelings onto you, which left me terrified!This is very hard to put down, and definitely not a book to be reading at home alone at night! Just remember, don't invite them in!"
5,Very good,"The book didn't scare me. Why am I giving it five stars then. Well, I saw the miniseries version first. The miniseries was good, and I was on the lookout for the book. Well, at my vocational school, I noticed it and read it the first chance I got. The miniseries was so faithful to the book, that not one part scared me. But, it was still great reading. Definetly not for kids under 13. I prefered the head vampire concept in the miniseries over that in the book."
4,"Well written, but pretty standard on vampire issues","Considering the fact the book was written about 30 years ago, the 'standard' in the title of this review isn't as bad as it sounds. In the past 30 years, we've been exposed to quite a lot of vampire lore, in various books, movies and TV shows (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, for instance), so what might seem standard to us might have been a highly innovative idea when the book was originally written.S. King does what he does best, which is describing people's lives & personal perspective from a point of view he knows best (small Maine town, a writer is the hero, etc)."
4,Scary and Stylish,"Being Stephen King's second book, 'Salem's Lot proves to be a preview of things to come from the spellbinding author. In my review of Needful Things, I wrote that Kings writes that book in the same tradition as this one. Although Needful Things is a much better book than 'Salem's Lot, the scary and stylish vampire novel by King is very entertaining and shows signs of brilliance we see later on in such King epics as IT and Needful Things. Many people seem to forget about this fun, simple-minded story. King doesn't break any new barriers writing the novel, but instead, shows us that he is beginning to find his knack for his genre of writing. Always a good read, 'Salem's Lot is a good Stephen King book to start out with, before you get to the really good stuff."
5,A very good book by Stephen King,"""""Salem's Lot"" is one of my favorite books because I love the genre it deals with and the fact that King is a great character developer. The book is written so that you really get to know the people involved in the story. The turns of the plot leave you feeling Helpless,hopeful, and SCARED! The setting of the story make you believe that this could happen anywhere!! I'm not a huge reader of King's novels, but I rate this one the best of the ones I've read."
5,AN ABSOLUTE CHILLER!!!,"Though one of his early works, Stephen King displays his mastery of the dark art of story-telling as he takes the readers to Salem's Lot. Let the master drain your blood in the vampire novel that will challenge the horror of Stoker's Dracula!!! Submit your will to Barlow! Surrender yourself to Stephen King!!!"
3,Exciting,"I read this when I was 10 years old and it scared the BJ out of me. The suspense is very well played, but the characters lacked a certain depth. The only one I really connected with was the priest and he died about halfway through the book. If you are looking for horror I recomend this book, but if you are looking for a good story I recomend ""The Shining"" or ""Insomnia""."
3,"Not bad, but not entirely satisfying","The first Stephen King book I ever read, 'Salem's Lot is an interesting piece of literature (or ""good trash"", as King so joyfully puts it in the introduction). There are well-drawn characters (if a bit cliched), a definite feeling of suspense, and plenty of good old-fashioned haunted-house (or in this case, city) scares. Unfortunately, the story never quite takes off. You whip through the pages of mounting suspense, thinking that something really big is going to happen, when the book just goes out, not with a bang but a whimper. The whole thing just quietly ends, without much of a final conflict--the survivors just basically give up. Needless to say, this is disappointing. If you're a King fan, 'Salem's Lot presents familiar pleasures, but it may not be enough to satisfy the casual reader."
3,salems lot,this book was one of my faverites from many years ago did nt pack the same punch this time around . i think mr king should not have tampered with the original .adding a dracula esk like story at the end did nothing to enhance what in essence was already a masterpiece my appolagies CONSTANT READER.
2,"Not terribly scary, with little realism","This book starts out well enough, though the reader must trudge through the obligatory small peaceful town setup. As a writer settles back to his hometown to write a novel, a mysterious antique store opens up with some odd owners. From then on, the vampire situation appears.A small town infested with the living undead is a great premise, but the story just doesn't live up. Instead of a terrifying takeover and escape story, the book appears almost comical. Basically, in a period of a few days, a few men try to rescue the town, but do a downright miserable job. The ending is very disappointing, the characters are not enduring, the language sentence structure is too terse, it's too many pages, and the plot, to put in the vernacular - just sucks.This book is more reminiscent to a bad B-movie. It tries to scare, but the only frightening part was that fact that other people find it scary."
1,"What was King thinking, new Dracula?","I did not like this book because of fashion it was written in. The description and suspense was, as in all king books, worthwhile. But I thought that King should have told the reader what happened to the vampire victims. Another thing that I did not like was making a timetable of the whole town; I thought that was very boring. When I finished this book I was glad, telling what the whole town did every day made it seem longer than 451 pages. Myself, I would not recommend this book to another person because only the last 75 pages were worth reading.This book takes place in a small new England town called Jerusalem's Lot, nicknamed `Salems Lot. The main character, like most king novels, is a writer named Ben Mears. He comes to `Salems Lot to write out his childhood fears. At the same time a new horror has arrived at the town and its taking over."
1,So this is KIng??? Boring!!!!,"I heard so much about Stephen King. I had nothing to do so I read this book. Man! was it boring. No interesting characters. Didnt really scare me a bit. Boring plot. Man! if this is King's best work, I better stick with, the master of story telling, the master of the Vampire Chronicles, the real deal, Anne Rice!"
1,Worst purchase ever!,They said the book was like new. It was one of those old terrible condition library books. I do not recommend buying from them at all. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE!!!
1,only so so at best,if this book had been put out by publishamerica it would have been a great book mr king needs to join the growing publishamerica family or stop putting out books
4,GREAT BOOK,this book took me a few weeks to read (long time for me) but i loved this book i think it is one of the best stephen king boooks i have read yet.
4,Where King is King,"This is King's second novel, his first being Carrie, which was a manuscript his wife rescued out of the trash. Where Carrie is tentative, Salem's Lot is confident. By this time, King really has a handle on what he wants to do, which is to enclose his image of Maine in every paragraph. Oh, and its really scary too!"
3,I'm 16 reading it for a project and found it good.,"I have to do an ISU (independant Study Unit) for english and I had to choose a book.. so since my dad is a huge King fan i figured all the books hes bought have to be good and being the type that likes vampires I chose this one. I read the first 100 or so pages and found it draggy but it did get good near the middle and end. The only thing was that there is always something to do with a guy and a girl, it's suppose to be about vampiers not a couple. I think it was good but not as good as it could have been or expected. But just cause there was one kind of boring book by king does not mean I won't read the others!!!"
4,One Of King's Finest,Don't hesitate to read this awesome vampire story as King delivers a chilling tale of bloodlust. Stephen King did most of his best writing earlier in his career and this is just one example of an extraordinary imagination. What else would you expect from a vampire story other than what Salem's Lot brings to the table? This is a wonderful testament to King's huge collection of literary horror.
4,"Starts Slowly, but gets a lot better","I had a tough time getting into this book. Nothing really happens for 100 pages or so. I'm an avid fan of Stephen King, so I stuck with it. I'm glad I did. This modern tale about vampires is one of the best I've ever read. The suspense is overwhelming. It slowly creeps up on you and builds throughout the novel (in part due to the slow start of the novel).My only other nitpick with this novel (other than its slow start) is that there are passages that are beyond boring. Particularly the ones without dialogue (The Lot chapters except The Lot IV). It was a feat of willpower to get through these.Bottom Line: Stick with this novel, you won't regret it. Sure there are some tough spots to get through, but when you do, you'll find an excellent vampire novel that is tough to beat."
2,not one of his best,"I am and have been a fan of Stephen King's books for a couple of years. I am also a vampire buff. I thought that the combination of King and vampire would be perfect. It didn't live up to my expectations. ""Salem's Lot"" was rather slow moving and boring."
4,i vant to suck your blood...,"the only reason this i give this book a ""7"" is because it was extremely good at some parts (as most king books are) but unfortunately, got so boring and confusing that i could barely finish it! still, i think it is worth reading if you have a lot of time or maybe a passion for anything vampire."
3,six,"Wonderful concept is given a sluggish text. The Bonnie character is too flat; maybe if he cut her out it would have read faster. It doesn't live up to its rep, but nevertheless, a good novel."
4,A great book for a Halloween mood.,"This is the King we all know and love. A well crafted plot, realistically flawed and interesting characters, suspense, small town quaintness all contribute to making this a wonderfully interesting read, rather than another dull, witless Vampire story. This is a book you can curl up in on a chilled Autumn day."
4,Wow!!! Just Awesome,"I'm what you might consider a Stephen King novice, having just recently becoming a fan. This was only the 3rd book I had read the previous two being The Stand and Needful Things. All I can say is, ""wow"" what an amazing book. While the book is certainly short by King's modern standards of the 700-1000 page opuses he has come to be known for, the details are not lacking. Just a great read all the way around."
3,"A good start, but not the ultimate weapon in King's arsenal","As a young vampire-fiction fan, I was thrilled to find such a novel by Stephen King. As noted in the above reviews, it starts slow, but builds momentum as the story unfolds. I rate this a three because, although the story is enjoyable, it is not close to comparable to The Stand or It, which are my favorites. King has truly matured in his style, which is noticeably lacking in this novel. Definitely a good read, but don't hope for a perfect novel!!!"
4,Vampires in Maine?!,"Many critics have said Stephen King isn't a very good writer. There are twenty characters or more in `Salem's Lot, and it takes a pretty accomplished writer to write about every one of them and tie up all loose ends. Stephen King can tell a great story. There is great pace and mounting suspense when all the people start disappearing. All the suspense and drama occurs in the last 150 pages, when Ben Mears and Mark Petrie (and a few others with them have disappeared or died) have to find Straker and kill him. The part where the basement stairs are sawed off and knives are arranged blade up on the floor is very chilling."
4,What a Suspense Thriller!,"I haven't read Stephen King in many years. And the last book that I read seemed rather elementary at the time, which is why I probably waited so long to pickup another one of his books. Buy, WOW, and I glad I got ahold of this one!Sure, I saw the movie years ago and I remember liking it, but other than that, I don't remember much about it. The book is FAR better than my memory and likely follows a different story-line from the movie. I may have to go rent it to watch again.Mr. King keeps you pinned to the seat with surprises and spooks around every corner and he keeps you guessing as to what is coming next. If his other novels are as good as this, I may have to start picking up his books again.Classic VAMPIRES! How can that go wrong? I am a re-newed fan!"
3,This book was slightly better than okay in my opinion.,i wasnt quite sure what to think when i started this one.....this was my first king novel and i was told it was a pretty good one to start with....im not too big of a vampire novel fan but im not opposed to it or anything...the book was good...i definitely enjoyed it....i thought that the first half of the book was pretty slow it got better at the end....if you are into vampire stories i would recommend it but if not i would try another one of kings books before this...i think i might go with the stand next.
2,Skip it if you're looking for good Stephen King,"As a King/horror fan, I'm sorry to say this book was a let down. In 600 pages (my version) there is very little character development and, as a result, you really don't care what happens to them when the action finally starts to go down (not that there is much of it). It isn't scary and the dialogue/story are sometimes laughably unbelievable. You can tell King was just starting off. It's a cool premise that goes nowhere fast."
3,Reddragon,The product came quickly. It was exactly as advetised and met expectations. Thank You. I hated the story very boring. Shipping and product was in good condition.
4,The only emperor is the emperor of ice cream.,"This is one hell of a book, it is gripping and has all the necessary ingredients for a classic horror novel, it keeps you riveted all the way through, even when there is nothing really happening you are still gripped because you get the feeling that something will happen. Such as when Win Puritons dog is hung on the fence I didn't expect that but it was still tense. when I was reading up to it. I love the book, it is balanced with fantasy horror and realism that is so perfectly written it is bound to spark a lot of emotions, it is a pretty graphic and rather unsavoury thing to read, gruesome even, but that was what it was intended for and in that context it is a complete success and I love it well done Mr King..."
5,What A Book!,"WOW! Now this was the first Stephen King novel I read because i'm a real vampire nut but after reading Salem's Lot i'm sure i'd love any of King's novels. I had a little trouble getting in to the book at the begining but then I just couldn't put it down ( even though I wanted to because it was so scary ). King has wonderful description and his characters are people whom most of us can relate to can relate with. As one person said it leaves you thinking 2 things: 1. They got theirs in the end and 2> Hey, this is left open as if there's going to be a sequel!"
5,masterpiece of emense spine tingling proportions.,"one of kings finest masterpieces.It was the first king I had read and ceartanly not the last,he has grown to be my favorite author.this book makes the movie and all other vampire movies look like the muppets.bloody,gory,tense,exiting,can not put it down once you have started.a true must read."
4,Very INTERESTING book,I think that this book was interesting becasue it had a different perspective on the modern day vampire. There were a couple gross scenes in it (and i dont mean blood and guts-if you get my drift) but this book was really enjoyable.I dont recomend anyone under 12 reads it though. *there is violence *there is sexual content *There is tons of swearing But nothin youve never heard before!
5,Scary!,"Vampires have always been something that can make my skin crawl. But Stephen King takes it one step further. This book uses the most vivid imagery of everyday life. It endolds you, and sucks you in (no pun intended) to the plot. The end of the book does not result in a cataclysmic battle between good and evil, but leaves things hanging in the air. The use of child vampires still haunts me to this day. Stephen King's ""Salem's Lot"" is great reading, even if you are not a King fan!"
5,Great Work By The King,"I read this book not expecting much, when i heard it was about Vampires i thought it might be a littile bit to childish but while i was reading the book i found myself getting VERY frightened. this was a very well plotted book with a good ending. theres never a dull moment with the king!"
5,the book was off the hook,A couple of crazy teens experiment with some secret drug experiment.Later get married and have a little girl name Charlie and she is not a normal child.years later the girl charlie sets her teddy bear on fire by looking at it.Cool book
2,King is so much better than this!,"I'm a rabid King fan but he has gotten so much better since writing this. Carrie was pretty good do to its structure, but Salems Lot never really elavates past koontzes level. The story is very simple and the main villian is not really more complex than a saturday morning cartoon villian. I believe it's possible that maybe that is what king wanted, a scary fast rollercoaster of a horror story. But for my taste he is so much better while writing those epic and complex books that aren't so easy to group in one category."
2,disturbing scene of child abuse...,"The beginning of the book drags with boring mundane details, but it picks up when one of the characters tells of a frightening childhood experience in the infamous ""Marsten House"" which continues to haunt his dreams. I was just getting drawn into the story when I read about one of the 'Salem's Lot residents, a teen mom who loses her temper and violently lashes out at her ten month old baby leaving his eyes bruised and swollen. At this point, I was horrified and had to stop reading the book. No matter how great the book may be, I don't want have those disgusting images in my mind."
1,false,"This book was falsely advertised as illustrated. It had about 5 illustrations, none pertaining to the story and 2 or 3 were repeated from the front cover and back. I think customers should be warned about this."
1,Being undead would be less boring than reading this,"Wow, King can bore us over a thousand pages as he did in The Stand. Here he mercifully just bores us in a normal sized book. Hmmmmn. Chapters one thru twelve introduce everyone of no consequence in Salem. Chapter 13 kills them all off and turns them into undead. Why couldn't they be killed sooner ? I was fighting off sleep waiting for them to die. And gosh wasn't it so scary when the vampires ""fell on them"" ? Are these genuinely clumsy vampires or is Mr King's use of imagery not up to the task ? Watching old schlock Hammer movies is way more entertaining than reading this yawn-a-thon. Better than Anne Rice ? Do we care ?"
5,SCARYSCARYSCARYSCARYSCARY!!!!!!!!!!!,"What can I say, this is the scariest book I think I've ever read - and I've read a lot of Stephen King novels. I was afraid to look out my window at night, the images King creates are amazingly vivid (and horrific). For the first time in a long time a was drawn straight into the book, I couldn't put in down. I thought the ending left itself a little open, perhaps there will be a Salems' Lot II. It is not a King masterpiece in the way It and The Stand are, however it is a potent, scary book that cannot be put down easily."
5,Salem's Lot is wonderful!,Salem's Lot is a wonderful book. I couldn't put it down! Its defenetly Stephen King's best book he has ever written! I have to buy it so I can read it again :)
5,"Truly creepy, terrifying book!","I picked this book up one day because I thought it sounded cool. Boy was I glad I did! This is one of the best novels I have ever read. It truly scares you, and makes you beleive that this stuff is happening. It doesn't tell you about Jerusalems Lot, it SHOWS you Jerusalems Lot. Definately read this book if you have not read it yet! Best vampire novel ever!"
5,Awesome!,"'Salem's Lot is truly one of Stephen King's best books. It tells the story of Jerusalem's Lot, a small town in Maine. The book is about novelist Ben Mears and his fight to kill the evil force that has come to the town. With help from friends Matt, Jimmy Cody, and a young boy Mark, they try to discover where the vampire is living and make plans to kill it. After the whole town is cast under the spell they are basically the only people left in the town and take on the vampire, Barlow. Through a plethora of twists and plots this book will be loved by all Stephen King fans. if you are starting to read King this is a great book to start with. Read it!!"
3,Good Characters-Predictable Ending,"'Salem's Lot has a ton of characters in it. That's what made me keep on reading the book. I thought that the supporting roles of Weasel, and Matt were better then Ben and Susan. However, you do know what's coming a the end. But is there any other way to end a vampire novel? Overall, pretty good."
3,genuinely frightening,"Yes, I know, I'm supposed to think that this genre of popular horror is trash, etc, etc. To be honest though, this is a genuinely frightening book. Engrossed, and reading it at night and alone, I pulled the curtain across my window after I read the 'window' scenes, just nervous enough that some child like cadaver would float past and force me to run screaming into the hallway.Regarding King's manner of writing in general, I really enjoy his portraits of small town life, and the web of relationships that emerges as the novels progress. It is a nice combination - being really frightened yet also interested in the psychology of people in the town. King does this well, showing us how individuals are dragged into the horror; which weaknesses and desires lead people into particular vulnerabilities to the villains (in this case vampires). It's a fun, frightening, and gripping read."
3,Too long................,"The book itself is not too long, however the descriptions are too long and unnecessary, occupying at least one third of the book,and in that way the facts go slower then they actually go. I do not find it scary, although I may say it is interesting in some way, having in mind it is a work of fantasy world. Well the pages in which the gravedigger was working on the boy's grave and later he died during his stay at home of the schoolteacher plus questionings following the death somehow excited and made the book partly a page turner, although , reviewed as a whole, it was not. Nevertheless, depending on what sort one enjoys reading , it might be pretty a must read or a boring staff, whilst the writing skills of the author is undeniable. Compared to other books by King, however, it lacks some movement."
5,The essential Big Bend reference,"Ron Tyler's seminal work on the Big Bend of Texas is required reading for anyone who plans a trip to the ""Texas Outback"". This enchanting out-of-the-way part of Texas has invited explorers and adventurers for years and Tyler's historical treatment brings all the mystery and drama of the region to the surface for the modern traveler. The maps and historical photographs blend with the text to give the reader a ""sense of place"" that separates the Big Bend area from other southwestern landscapes. A must read for anyone interested in the remote lands of North America."
1,BEWARE!,This is a beautiful ring - an anniversary present for me 2 months ago. Unfortunately one of the diamonds came out after only owning it for 2 months. I contacted Amazon and there is nothing they will do for me b/c it is past 30 days. I was very disappointed that they wouldn't back this product. Now I have to pay for repairs on my own.
4,Lovely,"This is a very nice, simple, clean ring. Took about a week to get it, but I'm very pleased! The price is awesome, and well worth it!"
2,Is this real?,"The ring itself its pretty. However it came with a tag around the ring that read ""Made in China"".... I cannot see the marking that says how many K the gold is and the diamonds look weird.I have to take it to the jewelry store and get it evaluated, because I am not going to be happy until I am sure this is the real thing. Obviously once I know I will make a different review. For now, I feel robbed to be super honest.If it turns out to be a scam I will let you know and return it, if it is the real thing I will re post.Please do not put ""made in china"" tags around expensive rings... if we wanted that we would buy them at k-mart."
5,A great CD with alot of Blues flavor and Emotion,"This CD by Guitar master Ronnie Montrose is a real good Cd to set a listen and think , Because it really hits the emotional side of a person and has some of the Best Guitar solos Ronnie has ever done . Get this one it is really good David Gouty"
5,Awesome,"I can't believe that I just discovered this CD. What a masterpiece! Ronnie Montrose gives some of his best work here. I really enjoy all of Ronnie Montrose's CD's, but this CD is now in my top three favorite CD's from him (along with ""Speed of Sound"" and ""Music From Here""). Bravo!"
1,Canon ELURA 50 Whew! Canon finally see's the problem,"Hey everyone. I to have gone thru the dreaded ""eject cassette error"" on my Elura 50 and last year Canon did all of the same things to me to. Quoted me 650 to repair, then said nothing wrong just needed head cleaning, then they paid cost to repair but still same error once i got it back. Its been a paper weight here at home for almost a year cuz i was so dissapointed. But great news. There is an announcement on Canons website about the problem and we are being ""encouraged"" to contact Canon for repair. I took my camera in today and so far all is good they said repairs will be done at no cost. Check out their website for your self http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=PgComSmModDisplayAct&keycode=2112&fcategoryid=227&modelid=9037 Good luck folks"
3,"Generally Good, But Don't Bring to Tropics","The Elura 50 is a nice camcorder and does everything a beginning videographer like me needs. I just wish it could take higher resolution still photos and was a little better indoors. But most important, it does not tolerate HUMIDITY at all. I had a lot of problems when I took it to the Philippines, all of which cleared up as soon as I got back to LA. My understanding is that many owners have had the same problem when using the camcorder in a humid climate."
1,Very Disappointed,"I almost bought this camera as a gift. It LOOKS great, but LOOKS really can be deceiving! The picture quality is TERRIBLE! It is incredibly grainy video. The picture has speckles all over it. I'm thankful I didn't waste the money. I was able to see the picture on a monitor in 3-different stores. Then I asked to see some other cameras in the same price range using the SAME monitor -- what a difference. The Sony DcrTRV-33 and even the DcrTRV-22 had beautiful pictures. Even the Panasonic in its class looked much better. My advice... take a look at the Sony, and ask to see the picture on a monitor, if the store doesn't have one, go to another store that does. Otherwise, prepare to kick yourself because you won't like what you see when you get it home. Good Luck all--"
1,WORST CAM I HAVE EVER USED,"I Will Straight Get To The Point. This was a horrible experience! Specially Indoors, Pictures, like many are complaining is very very grainy and gloomy. Simply looks GREAT but works AWEFUL. I was totally embarassed by presenting this to my hubby Ifte...Went and changed it for a sony TRV22 !! Nothing like SONY !"
1,Terrible Experience - All Canon Digital Camcorders,"I would seriously rethink purchasing this camera, or any from Canon. There is a huge tape transfer problem with Canon Digital Camcorders. Bottom line is that a growing number of them have stopped working after only 7-10 hours of recording - usually just after the warrany expires. There are many theories as to why, but nothing has been resolved. Canon has not been helpful. (...)"
1,Flawed,"I purchased this camcorder shortly after it was released thinking the size and functions were perfect. Well after three years of limited use, the Eject Tape warning would pop up. And recently, when I put it on record, the screen stays black and the view finder stays black. Like many others here, I called customer service and was told to send the camcorder in so they can tell me how much it will cost to repair. When I asked if there was a flat cost for specific repairs, they said no. After seeing how much people were qouted, I dont think I'll take the chance of paying for shipping only to refuse to pay the high cost of repair.At that time, they tried to sell me the ""upgrade"" program. Just pay $200 for a ZR85 or $499 for a Optura 400 plus the exchange of my broken Elura 50. Sound appealing until you ask them if the cameras are new. No, they are refurbished. I liked the camera when it was new but after the problems I described, I suggest you stay away from their products."
2,ELura50 problems,"I got the ""Eject Cassette"" error last year and Canon repaired it for free. Lucky me.Recently, I downloaded ALL DV tape to my computer after I install a 400G external HD but after that, there is no image in the camera mode. It's like the lens cap is on. I called Canon after checking on their website, they think it is a bad CCD (lose connectin) and they are willing to fix it for me. They even send me the free UPS label so I can sent it to them for free.I think Canon must be under a lot of criticism with all the problems their late model digital Camcorder is having. Their service and support for their product is very good. At least they didn't tell me to buy a new camcorder instead! They probably knows their customers have paid a lot of $$$ for their Elura50, and their camcorder lasted a few months or only 10 hours of recordings (a few tapes)."
1,DO NOT BUY CANON ELURAS,"This line of cameras have a structural design flaw. After approximately one year of use, your camera refuses to accept any tape, and the tape compartment does not close. This happens regardless of how often you use your camera or how gently you treat it. Canon refuses to acknowledge that their Elura line is flawed, but just do an online search of the reviews about the Eluras 40, 50, 60, 65 and 70. You will see that there is a bunch of people out there with the same problems. Some are even considering a collective lawsuit against Canon. I read the bad reviews and decided to spend $500 on a Canon. Lost my money and my camera (one week after the expiration of the warranty the camera broke). I took my chances. Will you take yours?"
1,This camera sucks!!/ don't be a fool with Elura 50,"I bought this camera as my first ever own camcorder! I felt love with this when I saw it first time. It is so small and very cute. I bought this from best buy for $750. I used it for one trip and by the end of the trip it alraedy showed some bad pictures. Remember everything is new. Then onwards everything started. it says head is dirty, so I bought a head cleaner , but no use. then I was frustrated and then just kept at home. Then next time when I used as miracle everything is fine. Next time I cannot even focus it? can you belive it? It is been with me for 1.5 years and I used it 4 times and not working any more!!Your $750 long term investment!!!!!! They don't even have people to repair it. You have to mail it somewhere and they will tell you how much it will cost to you and you can decide you want to repair it or not?Otherwise they will send it back to you. Customer service?"
5,Helpful Atlas & Terrific Size,"Every year, I buy a copy of the new Rand McNally road atlas. Although relatively few things change on the maps, the publishers always add new features and improvements. This year is the first time that I also purchased this Midsized edition. At first, I was unsure whether I would use it much; however, I found that it's the perfect size to keep in the car.Recently, I was traveling long-distance and missed my normal turn-off; because of the inclement weather, I was distracted and didn't notice for awhile. Instead of being forced to turn around and backtrack, I was able to whip out my Midsized atlas and find an alternate route, all without stopping! The size made it perfect to read at the wheel, and the maps are clear and easy to read. It was much more manageable to read this atlas in the car than a regular atlas or road map. From now on, I'll be purchasing the midsized edition each year alongside the regular Rand McNally atlas."
3,"Ok, not Great.","I didn't care for this book as much as the others. The whole ghost thing didn't work for me. It seemed to make the story quite outlandish.Was a quick, ok read. Not her best."
2,Almost a one star.,"The story has a good start but really fizzled out like the author didn't have enough interest in the characters and took a lot of short cuts. The female degenerates into a TSTL character and the author tries to make a plot out of this character's stupid thought processes. By the middle of the book she's self-centered and unambitious to such an extreme degree that it seems like she suffers from depression and whatever that anxiety neuroses is that means a person's afraid to leave their house (or go very far from it). She doesn't own a car, is afraid to go on an airplane by herself, doesn't want to learn a skill to support herself and is content to live off the largess of her grandmother. I didn't find anything to like about her and the plot just goes downhill until the end."
5,Like all her work this one is outstanding!,Love this book! With all the supernatural stuff going on it gives a different edge to the plot of the story. I just love the way she combines the romance and mistery with a funny touch. If you love ghost stories with a touch of humor you will love this book!
2,disappointing overall,"I'm generally a huge fan of Erin McCarthy, but this book was a disappointment. McCarthy's writing is uneven in that her contemporary work is some of my favorite - bright, delicious, clever, satisfying - while her supernatural work is more flat, less intriguing, the characters less likable.This book is something in between. The writing is proficient but nothing exceptional or exciting. The characters are not terribly likable. I actually disliked the hero from the beginning, and although he became likable, his transformation was not handled well or smoothly - actually, it wasn't handled at all, per se. The heroine was an unsexy country bumpkin who may as well have been a gawky, bubble-gum-popping teenager with braces. Her sexual issues intruded but weren't well fleshed out, making for some bumpy sex scenes that ended up being flat where they needed to be tension-filled."
2,Somewhat Good,"This book wasn't too bad, but it wasn't quite that great either. I keep giving Erin McCarthy's books a chance, but a lot of them just don't seem to blow me away. In my opinion, her book, 'The Pregnancy Test' is my favourite so far.The main character seemed a little too shallow for me. Considering her background and upbringing it's somewhat believable. Her boy toy... well, it seemed highly unlikely that they would have attracted one another since they were complete opposites, and no, I don't really believe in the quote that opposites attract.Give this one a try, you never know, you might like it much better than I did."
4,good book,"i loved this story - especially how she meets him! i like how the town is involved in the story, but story still focuses on couple."
5,great product!,We have 2 kayaks and use 2 sets of these saddles to transport our kayaks. We have them mounted on Honda Pilot and there is enough room for both kayaks. We have found this system to be fairly easy to use and they hold the kayaks well.
4,Nice kayak carrier,4 stars because the metal mechanism doesn't keep the strap tight. There's a bit of slip in it. I overcome this by tying the strap to my bar - but I shouldn't have to. The saddles flex a bit while driving - I think that's good.
2,did not fit,"Cannot rate, did not fit truck. Was supposed to fit but did not so had to return it. Too bad, he really needed."
5,Smoking Hot House,This is a HOUSE music.My only complaint is that the Victor Calderone mix isn't on this.It's too bad some fool looking for a 5th rate heavy metal band and who states he has never heard this can leave an inane one-star Amazon review and lower the rating for this magnificent house classic.
1,what a PR screw up,"This is what happens when a band has no success for what-ever reason, but because they picked the name of an already established band, their small legacy gets mixed up with the earlier band's catalog of releases. It looks like SOMEONE, ANYONE from the record company would have hipped them to the fact that another band had a career using the same name.....plus one letter ""z"". Amazing that it was allowed to happen. I guess, to be fair, Amazon.com deserves some of the blame for their lack of quality control. Oh by the way, I never heard of this band, nor their music. They may be good, however. Oh heck , i'll try and give them a little boost.....buy it!"
4,ZXI63 Speakers,Installed in my Chevy dually's doors quite easily. Had to splice on new connectors and used self-tapping screws instead of provided harware. They sound very good.
4,"It is good for the price, but not exceptional","This pair of speakers is fantastic for the price $42. But to be honest, I don't think it's worth more than $50.The high and mid is very clear, but base is weak off the line.I suggest put these in front, and stronger base speakers in the back of car."
3,"Acceptable, but overpriced, medocre sound.","After 6 months in my truck, the sound from these is mediocre when compared with some RFosgate 2 ways that have been in the front doors for a while. The RFs really put them to shame, and I got them for 10 $ less.HiFonics used to make some serious audio goods back in the day so i tried them, but I should have been more careful when buying.. The ""led ights"" gimmick should have tipped me off.. Id prefer they put the focus on the sound instead. Maybe then they would sound as clean and clear as the RF's.Wont buy again."
4,Gay St. Louis,"The best thing about My Angel Hypothesis is that its set in St. Louis, a city with a heavy, but often overlooked, gay population. I also like that the book looks at racism and black-white gay relationships in a realistic fashion. This story is mainly character driven. Andy Martin is confused, not only struggling with his newfound sexuality, but also with his sanity. Tysin is Andy's very flawed ""angel"" and he drives the whole story. Only Marc, Andy's long sufferring partner, is ""whole and grounded."" Here and there are interesting and eccentric characters, like Petula, a transgendered secretary; Deborah, Andy's ex-wife; and Bud, a sadistic gay bar owner. The only aspect of the book that bothered me was the unsafe sex acts in the first half that often bordered on the offensive."
4,a classic on the subject,"Although out for a good while (since 1993) for books on building technology, this is still a good buy. Most of the information on applyiing good fire safety practice to building design remains applicable, although codes have changed somewhat since this edition was released. When the publisher releases a new edition, I predict that this book will continue to be as useful as it was when fresh out in late 1993. That the book continues to sell is a testament to its usefulness. It is simply a classic on a subject that few architects have investigated in depth."
2,Schwag Funk,"this is one of the worst funk albums of all time, i own all of bootsy's cd's and this is one is probably the worst. Corny rapping, weak bass lines, pretty much all the tracks have drum machines. Bootsy's Blasters of the universe is infinitley better than this schwag-ass bunk funk. The music smells worse than a fifty cents concert"
5,Happy music,"I just have to say that anyone that puts down this bubbly, happy music lives a very jealous and sad existence. Why anyone would not like this positive uplifting message to go for your dreams is obviously not living theirs. I wish there were more happy music like this. It complemented the show really well. Thank you to Cindy for recording it."
5,"A Solid, Informative Book","Flesh and Bone was required reading for my course in forensic anthropology. I found it very informative and interesting. I like how many of the legal terms were translated. The book has inspired me to pursue this field of study even further. I recommend it to students who are nervous about the sciences and cannot get through alot of technical terminology, and for those who are curious about crime scene investigation. The pictures are helpful even though some are quite graphic."
4,Not the BEST Simone's work but EXTREMELY good,"This trade paperback picks after Of Like Minds and is much better. Art is great like in OLM but story is MUCH denser. I guess I have soft spot for movies/books/comics that take reader to orient, but make no mistake, this is no Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee type of story. It looks like good old Master of Kung Fu in his best days combined with great oldies like Richard Chamberlain's Bourne's Identity. Anyway, villain Cheshire is everything but one dimensional and cast of characters is great.PICK THIS UP! It can be compared to Morrison's X-men.When is Marvel gonna publish Gail Simone's Deadpool and Agent X in one trade?"
5,"Once again, Gail shows us that she is a genius.","This trade focuses on Black Canary more than it does the others but that doesn't make this book any less brilliant.Black Canary's former sensei has been murdered by an unknown assailant and she must team up with the worlds most skilled warrior Shiva to track down the fiend responsible.Once again, Gail writes the woman as real women with the ability to kick ass. The banter is ever present amongst the BoP while the action is plentiful and the art is beautiful.If you want to get into Birds of Prey, pick up Of Like Minds and Sensei & Student together. You won't be disappointed with either."
4,Great Read,"Sensi and Student was my first introduction into Birds of Prey. let me tell you, it has been a great series and a fantastic introduction to the characters.This trade if filled with some fantastic character moments, action, thrills, and humor.I could rehash the entire plot for you, but I think you've seen or read it before. I can tell you that I really enjoyed this trade, and it is a bright spot in my collection. I wasn't let down one bit by this series.The only reason it doesn't get five stars, is I hoped the trade would offer more than the collection of comics. perhaps the writer and artists comments/sketches. Something more than the books recollected."
1,Save you money,"I got this as a gift from my wish list for christmas. After reading the one rave review I was excited to try it out. It broke the 1st and only time I used it. I am getting ready to send it back now. The part that you can turn to make the spray have soap etc. Coule not handle the pressure of water flow and literally ""blew the top off"" of the piece of junk. Oh well I guess for less than 20 bucks your not going to get much."
1,Euro Trash DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!,"We received this after my mother-in-law passed away. It was still brand new in the box and was never used. I read the directions, filled the soap dispenser and was going to use it to wash my Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited. I turned on the water, turned the dial to the rinse position and the the dial totally exploded hitting me in the face with the 2 pieces of plastic. It sounded like a gun shot. The car wash/wax detergent splashed into my face and eyes. I had to run into the house and flush my eyes out in the sink for 15 minutes to get the chemicals out. Thank God I am a Nurse who had 13 years of Emergency Room Experience. This should be reported to the consumer protection agency and taken off the market.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! IT IS DANGEROUS AND A COMPLETE WAST OF MONEY!"
4,"""IN FLIGHT"" oh yeah!","Having been an Alvin Lee fan since the 60""s,I can say that this two disc set gives the listener a true rendition of what Alvin Lee can do with a guitar.From 50's rock,thru the ""Blues"",with a touch of soul and jazz,Alvin lays it out.You can feel his love of music and the guitar in every track on this set.His playing and vocal renditions make a combination that's hard to beat."
2,Sounds good on paper,"I purchase this program hoping I can put together a photo slideshow as a farewell present for a coworker and also as a slideshow gift for my niece. I tried the trial version first. It has very easy menus and I was able to create my first slideshow in 20 minutes. It worked great in my home DVD. I decided to purchase the program the next day. After finalizing the DVD I decided to try out the slideshow at work. It didn't work in two DVD's at my work place. I tried at two other people DVD's, still nothing. I went back and I tried different setup menus. After wasting more than 25 CD's I decided to call the company. The technical support recommendation: purchase a similar DVD so my niece can play the slideshow!!!!! What a waste of time and money!! The program sounds good on paper, does not deliver. Don't waste your money!"
2,This title is very misleading.,"I was under the impression that this book would make fun of the difference between men and women, not talk about Tim's sex drive. I was very dissapointed when reading this. I thought maybe the subject would change, but to no avail. I really love ToolTime and thought this would be a comedy book to lighten my mood."
2,"Few of the pages are funny + I totally agree when he said ""a real man knows there's no substitute for good help, support..""","Only a few of the pages are funny although most of them are below-the-belt jokes. For examples from page 5 to 19, he described humorous situations that happened because his last name was Dick.What I like the most about this book is one of Tim's philosophies. In Acknowledgments section, he said ""All men like to think they can do it alone, but a real man knows there's no substitute for good help, support, encouragement, or a pit crew"". I totally agree.Besides the two advantages listed above, the rest of the book is bland."
2,Don't stand too close to this book.,"This book wasn't as good as it's hyped up to be. He spends an inordinate amount of time contemplating his genitals (because his last name used to be Dick, so he unloads years of childhood teasings here) and just generally being crude, vulgar and gross. And his stuff just isn't that funny. Jerry Seinfeld's ""Seinlanguage"" and Paul Reiser's ""Couplehood"" were much funnier. After reading this book, I'll probably never watch ""Home Improvement"" again."
3,"Funny, but thoughtful as well","Here's another book that clearly is an attempt to take advantage of the success of a television show. I enjoy Tim Allen's humor and thought his show was pretty good, and was expecting more of the same in this book. There is a lot of very funny material in this book, and I frequently laughed out loud. I especially enjoyed the chapter entitled ""The Secrets Men Never Tell Women"" (no, I'm not going to tell--you'll have to read the book!). Surprisingly, though, Tim Allen also reveals a philosophical side here as well. Parts of this book are quite thoughtful and reflective, and show a surprising depth. I definitely can relate to much of the material in the chapter on fatherhood. This is a fun book that also provides a little food for thought."
4,Some things don't work in words,"Tim Allen is a funny man - as long as he talks, when he speeds up with wit and wisdom, something you can hardly find in this book. Nevertheless, once he does it: There is one extremely hilarious episode concerning the sounds of life - about men who will always like to produce, and women who would prefer dying before burping in front of their elderly aunt and why they will never understand the pleasure of farts. This is, by the way, also the most educational part. (If you don't believe me, get married and answer me in two or three years time.)"
5,Enlightening book ALL should read!,"Chideya's book dispells many popular myths about African Americans that are rampant in the media, literature, etc. She paints a vivid picture of how people perceive ""others"" and the misconceptions that are created and perpetuated by ignorance. I have been told that this book is no longer in print because of its content...probably because some people do not want the truth to be known! Farai Chideya's book is am important and enlightening one that should be read by anyone who is in search of the ""real"" truth! This is probably the most informative book I have come across in years..."
2,Chideya isn't a numbers person,"Throughout much of this book, Chideya uses a very quantitative approach -with plenty of statistics- to prove her arguments. In my opinon though, she often doesn't supply all the pertinent stats, and occasionally draws conclusions that are either too simplistic or not suggested by the figures she uses. In all, I didn't feel like my own opinions were firmly challenged while reading this book."
5,THE INFORMATION REMAINS RELEVANT,"I found the information enlightening when I purchased the book so many years ago. Today, my children(ages 18 through 34) are reading this book and finding the information relevant and important. I would appreciate an update on the orginal information."
1,Very disappointing,"Having watched her even-handed reporting on TV, I assumed I would--in light of the title--get a fair-minded, non-hypey exploration of the complicated issues related to African-Americans. Instead, I got a simplistic, incredibly biased polemic. She distorts numbers and contorts and withholds facts to prove her points. Don't waste your money."
1,Disrupted by numbers,"I was dissapointed in this book. I found it a difficult read because the text was inundated with percentages, statistics and numbers. The author used statistics and percentages, which can be manipulated to 'prove' anything, to back up every one of her statements and opinions.I would have perfered much more straight reporting of her ideas and feelings and much less this mish-mash of numbers and percentages. A very cumbersome read."
3,Good Effort ---three and a half stars,"I was so happy that a gen Xer took the time out and wrote down and analyzed the current available data regarding various social statistics to come up with something totally different than what is always presented by the media. Farai Chideya took information and simplified it for her generational group, to see and interpret for themselves...the informaiton is very easy to read for those on the go. For those gen Xer's who are frustrated with the negative imagery presented, surely this one will do the job at dispelling the BS."
1,bad experience,"Worked fine for a few weeks but it just died while im driving. Had my car towed to my driveway, good thing it happened during the day.Reinstalled old distributor and my car is up and running again.Ive read that richporter is a canadian company but the unit that I received was made in TAIWAN..returned the unit and got my refund."
4,Gripping!,"When more than 400 pages are spent to describe the happenings of six hours, the whole drama is delectably gripping -- especially when the author does a wonderful job of embedding twists and turns. Some parts of the plot are predictable, and some others could have been described in lesser words. I can imagine this book being dramatized in a 1.5 hr thriller movie. If the reader has been to Europe and seen some of the churches/chapels/forts/sculputures in Italy, she would have found the novel even more interesting."
2,"Incredible, Unbelievable","This Vatican City, terrorist thriller pits science against religion (Roman Catholic) and neither wins.Normally novels that blend fact with fiction usually are, to some degree, plausible tales. Tom Clancy, Brad Thor, Steward Wood, to mention a few writers in Brown's genre, all write thrillers that are believable. Dan Brown, in this novel, does not.If set in today's world then a thinking reader has to question airplanes that go 15,000 mph! Anti-matter exceeding the destructive power of a 5 kiloton bomb contained in a plastic box! A Papal helicopter with a rate of climb only exceeded by military jets! And most implausible is the survival of the hero, American symbologist Robert Langdon, who falls to earth from a height of over two miles (using a windshield tarp and the rock free Tiber River, in Rome, to soften the impact) only to get up and save the day.This read is not up to story quality found in ""the Code"". Conditionally recommended"
4,"Not great literature, but great fun","Angels & Demons is a fascinating and fast-paced adventure through mysterious Italian Renaissance art, and I personally couldn't put down. What you have to keep in mind is that this isn't Dickens or Tolstoy- Angels & Demons isn't a literary masterpiece. But it works well for its purpose, like an action blockbuster film- not incredibly deep or profound, but incredibly entertaining. Dan Brown has written an interesting and fun novel, and it shouldn't be judged for what it isn't supposed to be. I liked this book way more than I liked The Da Vinci Code- its mood suits each scene well and the storyline is ingenious. If you're looking to read something for entertainment's sake, then Angels & Demons will not disappoint."
3,Holy Smoke!,"Despite historical and factual errors, this thriller does move fast and kept my interest until it's outlandish, ridiculous ending. The characters and dialog are cartoonish at best, but this isn't serious fiction, just a silly romp. In fact, it's very, very funny at times. The author's acknowledgements at the end are a real hoot in themselves. Based on this opus, I think I'll skip his latest blockbusting triumph."
2,"Oh, Come On!","The premise of this book is intriguing, and I have to admit Dan Brown tells a good story that keeps you reading. At first I was more than willing to go with the flow of the book. I don't know much about physics, so I could accept the initial premise for the sake of a good story. The trail of clues was fun. But page after page of descriptions of fighting between Langdon and assorted bad guys became tedious. Was he writing a novel or a screenplay for a B action movie? I was also willing to suspend logic to believe that Langdon could escape multiple near-death experiences within the space of a few hours, all for the sake of a fun read. But the helicopter survival? PLEASE - GIVE ME A BREAK!!!!!! Talk about ignoring the laws of physics - even I know his escape made NO SENSE whatsoever. There are so many twists with the characters that I felt manipulated, not entertained. All in all, the ending of this book totally ruins what could have been an exciting, if not very literary, read."
2,B-movie level writing...,"I almost stopped reading 10 pages in. Dan Brown is clearly not a good writer. I did enjoy the intricacies of his detective work (Indiana Jones would be jealous), but everything else is rather silly.*SPOILER WARNING*The Mach 15 flight, the hilarious explanation for the containment of the anti-matter, and the astonishment at the symmetry of the Illuminati symbols (It approached parody-level at certain points; certainly it can't be so hard to believe when its RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE READER).In addition, the silly way that the characters wonder if the Illuminati still exist (""They can't exist...can they??"" paraphrase) and the pointless plot-'twist' at the end almost did it in. I skimmed through the last 50 pages or so, I was so bored.Like I said, the detective work and references to history kept me interested (accurate or not), but this thing is pretty silly otherwise."
2,The Perfect Bathroom Book,"This book is the perfect book to read while you are on the toilet. It is essentially the plot of some kooky, low budget tv series - imagine Buffy the Vampire Slayer, an replace the vampires with some sketch mystery cult, and you've got it. The plot is clumsily amateurish - we understand one group to be good because we are told so, the other group is of course evil, because they have to blow something up. Every chapter ends with some kind of ""omygoodness what could possibly happen next"" hanger, which each subsequent chapter seems desparate to top - to absurdity and beyond! I generally enjoy tripe like this, a la Clive Cussler adventures, but this book really couldn't hold my attention for longer than a couple of chapters at a time (hence a bathroom reader). Something about the best assassin in the world being overcome by one clumsy scientist and his partially bound love interest really is laughable. Oh well. Better luck next time Dan."
2,Puzzle Driven,"Interesting puzzles, gruesome murders and secret societies are not enough to save this thriller. The villian is identifiable way too early. The hero is an encyclopedia of trivia no one would know outside of the Vatican walls. Too many escapes and too few traffic jams in Rome."
2,A disappointment,"Unfortunately I read Da vinci code first so when I started reading this book, I was thinking that it must be the same book with slightly different circumstances. Even in the begining when Langdon was woken up by a phone call, the same story with the beginning of Da Vinci Code when he was woken up by the police asking him for help.With this in mind, I kept on reading but then after Langdon found another body, gruesomely murdered and then met his victim's daughter, I said enough. I am not interested to read more.I was really looking forward to this but I am not a fan of formulaic writing, especially for suspense, mystery type."
1,World's Dumbest Ending!,"If the book had ended earlier, I would have given it five stars. In fact, the first 75% of this book was TERRIFIC, but the last quarter of the book -- especially it's ending -- was so freaking dumb [...]"
2,Derailed by Errors,"I did finish reading this book, but only through a supreme act of will. I lost my last shred of enthusiasm when Langdon and Vetra are just as puzzled as the Swiss Guard about how to find a plastic container of antimatter viewed by a WIRELESS camera. Get it ""wireless"" camera? Such a device broadcasts a signal to its base station where the information is assembled into the frames which display on the screen.That being said the entire plot should have disolved in the first few chapters by shutting down all of the other cameras and triangulating the one pointed at the antimatter. No big deal.That error made the remaining issues (continuity, character, excessive foreshadowing) stand out starkly.I have yet to decide whether to pick up ""The DaVinci Code..."" probably not."
3,Fun but ignorant of Catholicism,"This is a page-turner, with an interesting plot and what appears to be expert information about architecture and renaissance art. The Masonic symbology of the dollar bill is fascinating.However, the author's sloppiness with orthodox Catholicism is a disappointment. I won't spoil the ending with specifics, but his Catholic characters who should think in an orthodox Catholic way, do not. I would have no problem with characters who wanted to ""reform"" the Church having unorthodox ideas if they were presented as such. Those in the highest positions in the Church with beliefs at odds with Catholic teaching should know where they, themselves, differ with orthodoxy. This betrays a lack of familiarity with doctrine and those in the Curia.I read techno-thrillers in part to get an insider's view of organizations I want to know more about. Now I have doubts about much of the technical info in the book."
1,"silly, silly book","Dan Brown can write, i.e. he can create visual characters and places and has talent in that respect, but the plot on this and the actions taken by the characters is downright silly and dumb. It's interesting up to the mid point of the book then gets downright silly and dumb. The last 100 pages you just read to finish the book. You don't care about the people in the book anymore. He can do much much better. His editor should have sent him back to rework it!!!"
1,I want my money back,"I went into the book store and asked for a recomendation. I told the sales person that I do not enjoy mindless books for the mass public. She then picks up exactly that. If you're only looking to read because you want to look smart, well this is the book for you. However if you are an evenly remotely intelligent person avoid this pseudo-litature at all cost. The author pretends that he did all his research but if you are at all educated you can see right through it. This book is written for a lowest common denominator audience. The author even assumes that the reader wouldn't know basic facts about major historical figures. If you enjoy Vin Diesel movies then pick up this book, rather yet just wait for him to star in the movie version and stop reading so I can avoid getting recomended books that are only being writen because of you."
4,Worth the effort but . . .,"I'm not going to bother you with yet another boring review, there's tons of them here. BUT, you should know a couple of things:1. Though it's true Dan Brown can write, the average mystery reader can figure out what will happen to the four kidnapped cardinals without straining their brains. The hulking villian is so evil it is almost laughable. The heroine is predictable heroic, the hero is noble and has flaws which makes him totally ""pc"".2. ON THE OTHER HAND, BUT, HOWEVER the book is still worth the price of admission due to some unexepected plot twists, an amazing quirky turn, and an ending that was breath-taking. Like I said, the guy can write. So, Dan, why don't 'cha write great through the whole darn book?"
5,Thrill ride from beginning to end,"This book blew me away!!! I read this book before I read The Da Vinci Code and I must say that I was disappointed in The Da Vinci Code. Angels and Demons is much more exciting and informative. I like how Dan Brown teaches you history, symbology and science and you aren't bored with it. Anybody interested in secret societies and religious history will devour this book. The only problem with this book is that I had a hard time putting it down. Brown's stories are furiously paced and almost every chapter has a cliff hanger-like ending. If you liked The Da Vinci Code you will love Angels and Demons."
3,Not as good as DaVinci,"Read this book before the DaVinci code, as my cousin suggested. I liked it, but it did not blow me away like DaVinci (which I could not put down).Definitely would have been a disappointment if I read it after the D.C. My expectations would have been way too high.Basically a good story that fills in a lot of background story for the D.C."
2,Terrible Ending for an incredible start,"The ending was so far fetched and stupid that I almost quit reading it in the last 100 pages several times. The beginning was really great, but got crazy and dumb at the end."
3,Mediocre Mainstream Thriller,"Having just finished Angels and Demons a few minutes ago, I feel unsatisfied and eager to give this book less then 4 stars. My reasons for that deal with the fact that in my opnion Angels and Demons was too long, overly intense, and simply unrealistic at times. By the last one hundred pages I was just waiting for the story to end so I could start reading another book."
5,should have recieved the same acclaim as the Da Vinci Code,"I read Angels and Demons after the Da Vinci code and enjoyed it more. To me, the book was less predictable and the twist at the end suprised me more than the one in the Da Vinci code which you can see coming like a rabid herd of elephants.Angels and Demons is basically a murder mystery about religion, science and the problems caused by the age old conflict between the two.Its a brilliant read - fast paced, full of suspense and with a good plot line. I feel the only reason this book did not get as much acclaim as the DV code is that its subject is not as controversial. One word of warning though, although this book is extremely good, its fiction, and only fiction."
2,It could have been a decent thriller...,"It could have been a decent thriller if the author could stop 100 pages earlier. Langdon's ability to survive would make James Bond jealous, but the last 100 pages converted this book to a farce. The survival of Langdon jumping out of the helicopter without a parachute put the last nail into the book's coffin.I am only giving this book a second star for some fun I had reading the first few hundred pages."
2,No suspense of disbelief.,"Dan Brown is a skilled writer, but the plot of this story is simply too implausible. I did enjoy 'The Da Vinci Code' and especially the controversy it raised.If you like religious fiction as much as I do, then go for 'Journey To Eden' by Max J. Pucher and while the story in there is even less likely to happen, the plausibility, science and history is gripping."
4,Just like the Da Vinci Code...,"There is good news and bad news about this book. Good news: if you read ""The Da Vinci Code"" and liked it, then you will love this book. Bad news: You'll love it because they are basically the same story and plot with the same twists.Of course, if you like the idea of hidden messages and symbols in ancient art, then ""Angels and Demons"" is the book for you. The book relies on a fast-paced path with utter destruction looming."
1,This is the book for you!!!!!!!!!!,"Yes, if you enjoy overheated, cliched dialogue, unbelievable situations, characters with no real personalities, and stunning climax after miraculous revelation after shattering denouement until you wish the whole crew would just go home and relax - this is the book for you."
5,"Better ""Story"" than the Da Vinci Code","Although not as jolting an experience as the Da Vinci Code, this book's story is 10-times better. The characters are, as always with Dan Brown, extremely rich - and, even the evil ones, likeable. The story ""hits home"" in more ways than one. You can't go wrong with Dan Brown if mystery/history are things that interest you. The only problem with Brown's work is: After reading his books, you spend 10 times the amount of time researching as you did reading the book in the first place. He just makes you crave a deeper understanding for the information he presents. Excellent!"
2,Searching?,Ok Dan Brown has done it again by captivating the attention of everyone from Mormons to Catholics. He has set the stage for a new technology and another conspiracy theory in the Catholic Church. I really enjoyed this book as entertainment. But we were really searching there at the end for a story I would recommend this book for a good read. But the story was just searching for something at the end not really as good as the The Da Vinci Code. But carry on DAN you are doing an outstanding job causing great controversy in the Catholic Church and peeling people away from there faith in what they believe.
2,Good Plot - Less Than Impressive Execution,"I thought that the plot was original, if a little contrived. However, the actual text read like a script for a low-budget b-movie."
2,"Nice plot, awful writing","Mr. Brown's plot is thought-provoking and complex, though his writing reminds one of the entries in a high school literary magazine. It's a shame that such an interesting premise was tarnished by poor writing. Mr. Brown's heavy-handed foreshadowing makes what could have been several interesting plot twists obvious and mundane, and his liberal doses of ""character development"" read like his editor told him he had to put in some background on the main characters...on pages 87, 225, 316, and so on...making the supposedly enlightening looks into the histories of the characters seem misplaced and trite.Next time, Mr. Brown, come up with the story-line and let someone with real writing talent author the book."
1,I could not wait for the book to end.,"It is absolutely overrated. In terms of a travel book of Rome it is useful, but the style of writing is burdensome. The whole story could have been written in 5 pages, instead I had to suffer through hundreds of pages. Once I start reading a book I feel obliged to finish it, and this book was really a burden to read. For people that like B movies or thrash novels will enjoy this book."
1,This is not a novel.,"This is not a novel. It is not even a book. It is a tedious description of a video game.Dan Brown writes so terribly that he is beyond criticism. No adjective - no, string of adjectives - is too trite or cliché for him to throw in.All I can hope is that Mr. Brown made so much money off this mess of a book that he need not ever write another."
2,Exciting in a very dull way,"The story being told in this book is exciting, suspensful, and very interesting. The way Brown tells it, however, is nothing short of annoying. He has a knack for pointing out the obvious. Over and over. In fragments. Like this. Then, he recounts numerous tales from the characters' past. The majority of these stories have nothing to do with the current action and offer no insight into the character's psychology, they just fill pages. If you cut out that superfluous character history, the repetition and the messages from Captain Obvious, this would be a much shorter (and very much more enjoyable) read."
3,"Not as good as ""The DaVinci Code""","""Angels and Demons"" is much more predictable, and therefore less interesting, than Dan Brown's more recent book, ""The DaVinci Code."" It's OK, but it doesn't really compare to ""The DaVinci Code."""
1,Wow - amazingly bad,"I read ""The Da Vinci Code"" a few weeks back and was blown away by the pace, the style, and the fun I had reading it. So ... I decided to try his earlier novel. It's practically the same story! So how could this one be so bad and Da Vinci be so good? I'm still trying to figure it out. This one has such a formulaic feel to it that it becomes insulting. And what is with the exclamation point?!! Earth! Wind! Fire! Water! And sometimes, question marks followed by exclamation marks?!! This guy has read one too many Robert Ludlum novels."
1,Almost Unreadable,"I picked this up because I had enjoyed the 'Da Vinci Code.' While I found the writing style of the Da Vinci Code pompous and insipid, it was a great story, and that more than made up for it. Sadly, this early work is unreadable, at least for me. The characters are so unidimensional, and the dialogue so stilted and contrived, that the reader is too distracted to suspend the disbelief necessary to submerge into the plot."
1,Dippy rehash of the dismal DaVinci Code,"Let's see, a strange murder by an underground cultic organization bent of discovering long suppressed secrets, followed by a phone call to the sleeping ""art critic and symbologist"" who slams the phone down with a ""call me at the office!"" attitude, but then can't sleep, wondering....This is the story board for both this screenplay-disguised-as-a-novel and the dismal ""all of this is really true"" pack of lies called Da Vinci Code. Dan Brown has one story, and is trying to sell it again. Happily, this one has less of an axe to grind, but just as much non-scholarship."
1,Turn and run,"Awful, just awful. Bad science on every page distracts from what might be an interesting story. Dan Brown should stick to writing about what he knows. Don't bother."
2,"Lame, just lame","The book has interesting elements, lots of history and mysticism, it started out quite entertaining, although completely implausible. But the author gives away the villain in an obvious aside in the first few chapters, why bother reading further? Then, when he could have ended the novel tightly, he continues on and on until you are insulted by how confoundingly dumb the ending is. If he had ended it 200 pages sooner, I could have given it 3 stars. I sure hope the DaVinci Code is not this dumb."
4,Good. but not as good as Da Vinci Code,I think this thriller is pretty good. It is the prequel to Da Vinci Code and its only relation to the book is that it has the character of Robert Langdon. There are 137 chapters that range in length from 1 to 6 pages. The first 20 chapters are a little slow but soon it gets riveting and intense and very hard to put down. The end is very good and there are surprises after surprises in this book that are very well crafted
3,"Decent, but not as informative as Davinci code.","When I started reading this book I thought ""Great! A story where I'll learn about Physics and the Illuminati."" So, I started looking up some of these topics online and learned that there's some really cool stuff. Unfortunately, none of it shows up in the book. Davinci Code had a ton of background information and really got me interested in some of the topics it presented. Angels and Demons barely touches on the subjects of interest. It's worth a read as far as suspense goes, but it doesn't seem as well researched as Davinci Code."
4,The ending is spectacular,"I do agree with many of the reviews of this book that state that character development and depth in this novel is lackluster at best. Also, I find that Dan Brown has a problem with fleshing out beleivable action sequences (at least in this one, which is the only one I've read of his). However, these shortcomings are vastly outshadowed by a fantastic plot, and a an absolutly stunning and unpredictable ending. If the ending is what makes a story good, then this book is a masterpiece. Also, the theories and ancient secrets that are revealed in this book will make even the most stubborn non-believer into a paranoid conspiracy theorist, for a little while anyway. I highly reccomend this awesome book, and if not for its few problems, would have easily recieved a 5-star rating."
3,Did Illuminati kidnap the real Brown?,"The Dan Brown of ""Angels"" is a far better writer that the hack who ground out ""DaVinci Code,"" making me wonder if the real author got a little close to the conspiracy. . .Seriously, ""Angels"" is a fun read, and actually goes into some depth about Vatican history, Italian art and the tourist traps of Rome. The plot takes some nice twists, and pops some genuine surprises on the reader. Excellent villains as well. The only similarities to ""Code"" are the cardboard cutout heroine and convoluted conspiracy that stinks of anti-Catholic bigotry. Come on, if the Vatican were that powerful, there'd be no abortion clinics to picket or priest-abuse scandals to read about. Perhaps if Brown takes as much care with his next novel as he did with this one, he can regain his literary self-respect after the ""DaVinci"" farce."
2,Not my favorite thriller,"I don't mind authors applying artistic license to the facts--it is, after all, fiction. But I do mind sloppy storytelling. I think that's what this is. It seems that character development and great writing were ignored in favor of action/pace. It's obvious that Dan Brown is a decent storyteller, just not a fabulous one. He knows the elements of good thrillers: setting high stakes, pitting good-vs-evil (even when there is a graying or blurring of them), making the solution time-critical (the ticking time-bomb), a sympathetic protagonist. He just doesn't pull all of it off that well. And there's some ridiculous action toward the end that made me want to throw the book across the room. Is it trash? No, bit there are a lot better suspense/thriller novels out there."
1,Watch the movie,"Wow hated the book. Loved the movie! To Dan Brown: have screen writers redo your next novel before it's released. They will improve what is incredible and implausible to credible and plausible.A couple examples of the screenwriters improving your story line: In Angels & Demons the book, our do-everything hero, Robert Langdon, bails out of a high-flying helicopter without a chute and incredibly survives with a few scratches. The movie has the camerlengo going up alone.And, incredibly in what is clearly a mega disaster unfolding, the book had only the Swiss Guards involved. The movie had swat teams, commandos and other authorities involved in clearly an emergency situation.Finally, in the movie, Langdon was truly an academic, not Indiana Jones."
4,Excelent and enterteining - A novel about a great fabrication....,"It is a fascinating Sci-Fi novel inside Rome and the Vatican.A novel well written and easy to read, light in its content but well investigated. The scheme is quite predictable, but the book is full of action and keeps the reader interested to the end. In the drama, the personage's characters are rather ill defined, but that makes the plot simple enough to be understood without the need for notes. The unsuspected reader may be surprised by finding certain political facts and some individual details related to the organization, and political powers that manage the Vatican. It is a novel about a novel... It is a romance about the great fabrication of all times....!Perhaps a little long novel.... Could have been a bit shorter....Buy the illustrated edition, is worth it even if you have been in Rome."
3,to the point,"Angels and demons is a taut,suspenseful novel that will keep you onedge while symbologist Robert Langdon races against time to saveVatican City from apocalyptic terror."
4,Excellent Read,"Fast moving and Electrifying allbeit extremely far fetched at times. I found A@D an outstanding read. All of those people nitpicking about scientific details should visit the Nonfiction section or read a Dictionary. Brown uses some ""factual"" details to weave an extremely exciting thriller. It takes elements from Indiana Jones/The Bible/Star Trek/Star Wars and any type of apocalyptic movie. The one downfall is that this book is extremely similar to the Da Vinci Code. So I recommend choosing which one you are going to read first very carefully since you will no doubt be disappointed slightly when you read the other novel. Nonetheless both are well worth reading. Enjoy."
3,Just okay....,I thought that Angels and Demons was just okay. I liked Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code much better. I had a hard time following Angels and Demons since I am not Catholic. Check out The Da Vinci Code....that's 5 stars!!!
2,So totally unbelievable and the writing...,"Thrillers encompass a suspension of belief that holds the story together. Jumping out of a helicopter and floating down on coattails did not do it for me, nor wrestling down a sarcophgus. Brown's earlier thrillers, although over-the-top, were more believable. Less controversial, but more believable."
5,Genius! One of the best books ever!!!!!!!!,"If you like literature at all, read Angels and demons. It is a ridiculously amazing book, with plot twists, action, great storytelling, lifelike characters (except Vittoria, who is a stereotypical damsel in distress kind of character), many bits of knowledge about history and other such subjects, and the most pulse pounding grand finale of all time. I read 600 pages in one very long sitting. That`s how good it is. While this is a must read, if you`re a kid or really sensitive person, don`t read A & D, as it has violence and small amounts of sexual content. Still, you might want to make an exception because of the sheer awesomeness of this amazing book: its one of the best!!!!!!"
1,"Awful, awful, awful",There are several murders in this book and after reading it I wished I had been one of them. People that are raving about this book should be ignored. They have no credibility or taste. This book is drivel and should be avoided.
1,Big let down,"My first Dan Brown experience was with The Da Vinci Code, and what a great book that was. I purchased Angels & Demons shortly after expecting the same thrills. It just wasn't so, I thought this book was a complete let down. Professor Langdon was a weak character in this book and an even weaker, or more like pathetic, excuse for a hero! Overall, a big disappointment."
1,imitation late Ludlum.,"What a disappointment. I bought this book based on the reviews and while it has some good ideas the style, story and characterisations are so obvious as to make them ludicrous, as is the bad guy. Pick up a second hand copy of some of the later Ludlum rubbish instead."
1,Worst book...,"I've read in years. My husband bought it at the airport and having enjoyed The Da Vinci Code, I expected this to be a fun read too. It's poorly written, the plot twists and turns are not believable, and the ending is just ridiculous. I want my time back."
1,An Insult To The Reader,"This book is a waste of time for anyone who prefers to read a novel with credible happeningsAngels & Demons - Movie Tie-In: A Novel. The hero, Robert Langdon, is a veritable superhuman whose mental computations and physical prowess far exceed those of a normal human being - sad that the Illuminati should have chosen to take him on. The reader can delve through pages of his processes and action and then realize only one minute of novel time has passed. Brown twists time to the extent where he might as well have ended the novel on the first page. The end is the ""crowning glory"" where Langdon parachutes to safety under a 10 kiloton blast, using only a tarp. If the history of the Vatican and it's churches in Rome is true, it's the only thing which saves this novel from being pure drivel."
4,2nd best book by Dan Brown,"The precursor to the infamouse DaVinci Code that shocked the world. You can tell the writing style in this one isn't as well polished. However, the final suspense is almost as good as DaVinci Code. You really have to read this one to fully connect with the main character from DaVinci Code."
3,The bad guy goes up in perfumed smoke,"A plot to blow up Vatican city with an evil mastermind Janus andan Arab Hassassin are not exactly foiled by the intrepid Robert Langdon. He also seems to fall in love with an young Italian biophysicistwho is the adopted daughter of a Roman Catholic priest who has invented a method to make an capture anti-matter particles at CERN in Switzerland.The scrapes Langdon goes through really stretch credibility in this action and murder filled novel. I've read enough novels pretty much just like this one, that I can't rate it highly, even if the brand designs used on the murder victims are very inventive."
4,"Great book, weird ending","I, like many others, read DaVinci Code before Angels and Demons. In the end, I really enjoyed them both. I found them to be remarkably similar, which isn't altogether bad.I enjoyed the problem solving and adventures that take place in Angels and Demons. Mysteries surrounding the Vatican and Vatican City are always interesting, but Mr. Brown shows us some new and interesting aspects of them both, and also Rome.This book kept me turning the pages, which I loved. In the end, though, I was a bit disappointed with the ending. Not so keen on the 2 people who jump out of the helicopter 3 miles in the air and survive with no parachutes...that is too weird to fit in with the rest of the book. I thought the ending was a bit contrived, but over all the book is great, and deserves a read."
2,Always Read the Book First!,"I was taking a long road trip, so I decided to listen to the book first instead of reading it. Big mistake!! The narrator/actor's over-the-top melodramatic style of reading only magnified the annoying way in which Mr. Brown seems to absolutely refuse to give the reader any straight information. We know that Langdon is gazing upon one of the most horrific things he's ever seen, but we won't know what it is for about fifty pages!As the end neared, I found myself getting irritated at a book! Who does that? And I don't know if I was bothered by the content, or the cheesy, dinner theater-style presentation. I adored Da Vinci Code. I think I would have an entirely different opinion of this book if I'd read it first! Lesson learned!"
3,Not the Da Vinci Code at all,"I'm surprised by the comparisons to the Da Vinci Code. Sure, it deals with the Roman Catholic Church, but it's quite different. In fact, while the Da Vinci Code comes across somewhat anti-Catholicism, this takes very opposite stance.This is also a novel, where the Da Vinci Code was a lecture. The back history is explained much faster, and you're treated to a great deal more plot, with smarter twists.There are huge flaws, as mentioned in other reviews. The time-table is sketchy, the history is altered for reasons unknown, facts are confused, and the ending seems to have a few too many twists and a fall a bit too great.That aside, it's entertaining. Not amazing, but entertaining. Just keep in mind that you're checking your brain in the coatroom when you read this book, not bringing it along to learn. If you desire to learn you'll end up getting a great deal of Trivial Pursuit questions wrong after this book."
1,This is the same book as the Da Vinci Code,"This book was terrible. Interesting info and research but it was EXACTLY that same plot as The Da Vinci Code. In both books, it is easy to anticipate what is coming next."
1,Cheap pulp at best,(warning- Spoiler in feedback) The evidence of historical research supporting the backdrop was commendable. However it does little to elevate the novel beyond pure pulp. Some segments were too far fetched and coincidences too contrived. The principal characters were cartoonish caricatures. The Pope involved in artificial insemination? A priest who just so happen to have a helicopter license? Gimme a break. Save your money. Wait for the B movie version on Spike channel.
1,Foucault's Pendulum for dummies,"A shallow, dumbed down version of Umberto Eco's great Foucault's Pendulum. After all of the raves I have heard about this book and this author, I was very disappointed. The characters are predictable and only lightly fleshed out, especially the villians. Everyone's motives in action and in life are easily explainable in a paragraph or two, and many of the characters are just absurd (the assassin especially, or sorry, Hassassin). The plot is filled with historical references and conspiracy theories, but it all feels hastily put together and too light, as if intended for TV. A second-rate thriller at best."
2,So Cliched it Gives Cliches a Bad Name!,"I was thrilled to finally get my hands on a copy of this much-praised thriller, but after the first couple pages I was reading just for laughs---and there were many. The cliches of character, description, action, plot, and just about everything else are a hoot! The characters are so comical, the writing so hackneyed, and the love affair so predictable that this book gives cliches a bad name. If you ever read Alastair Maclean, seen Raiders of the Lost Ark, or most other thrillers of this ilk, you'll groan over this book---my wife and I had a great time on vacation reading passages out loud and laughing aloud."
3,"predictable, but fun","This book started off with an exciting premise - dead body, science, religion, all of it - but it was very predictable (yes, I've read the Da Vinci Code) - it wasn't that hard to determine who the bad guy was, who was going to be elected Pope, etc. - on the other hand - it was fun to read, and a page turner - read it for the entertainment, and that's all - the only thing I'm not wild about with Brown's writing is that he has little faith in the reader - he explains way too much, and answers questions for you - sometimes during his character's monologues I found myself wanting to skip ahead for the action - he might want to realize that people who read his books are not dumb. Plus, he seems to off the deep end at the end of the book (did in Da Vinci Code as well) - both of these books would make great movies because I believe Hollywood can tone down Brown's ""preaching"" and stick with the action."
3,Not as good as the Da Vinci Code,"The formula of this book is absolutely identical to the one the author perfected in the Da Vinci Code. A mistery, a secret society, a big plot of world domination, a trail of secret signs in a big city. The most important diference is that, if in the Da Vinci Code we were talking about Paris, here the city is Rome. It is good fun, but once you have read one of them, and the probability is that you read first the Da Vinci Code, the other one sound a bit repetitive. Also the ""physics"" part of the plot is not that interesting because it navigates through weird concepts and builds up an image of scientists that is totally out of any reality imaginable. Anyway, it is a good weekend read."
3,Good Read To Accompany The Da Vinci Code,"I like many others picked up this novel after reading Brown's, The Da Vinci Code. This book did an exceptionally good job of keeping my interest as it explains many of the ideas referenced in The Da Vinci Code. I decided to rate this a 3 for the fact that it was interesting an interesting read however, I felt like I reading the first novel for a second time. Don't let the 3 fool you I still believe its a good book and definitely worth the read. I would especially recommend this novel especially to someone who enjoyed The Da Vinci Code and would like to explore more work from this author. All in all I don't see predict this book as being nearly as ground breaking as his others more of a good addition to the fame of The Da Vinci Code."
4,Movie-type material,"I read A&D; months after reading The Da Vinci Code. These are my impressions:This book is a page-turner, full of suspense and twists. From the beginning, you don't want to stop reading it. If you look for a light summer read, this might be it.On the other hand you must remember that Brown's characters are somehow simplistic and more suited for a mass-market movie than for a classy best-seller. You just know they're not real. They're not human.To anyone planning on reading A&D; and The Da Vinci Code, I suggest you start by taking A&D.; DVC's main theme is more exciting and controversial than A&D.; It's better to save the best for last. And, take a few months between them. They're just too similar to be read at once."
5,Mesmerizing,"I, too, first read Dan Brown through Da Vinci Code and decided to read an earlier work. In many ways, I found Angels and Demons to be more spell-binding, albeit also gorier, than the better know book. It would be quite difficult to make a film of Angels. By including a substantial excerpt from Deception Point, the publishers have hooked me to plan on reading it too."
5,Wow!,"This book will knock you over, it is full of history, mystery, and intrigue. Well like the other Dan Brown novel I have read it takes place pretty much in one day and is fast paced. I finished this in 3 days because I could not put it down for hours at a time. Langdon is the man and I love all the art history involved in unlocking the secrets to the brotherhood. It is truly a great book, you have to read it."
3,Good exciting adventure,"It is a good read flowing the characters as they solve a mystery puzzle and narrowly escape death over and over in a period of just a few hours. Some of the story is bit of a stretch and certainly leaves the real world now and then. It takes a little extra imagination to accept the story. It borders on comic book style stories ala Indianna Jones. I enjoyed the book and look forward to ""Da Vinci Code""."
4,Better than the Da Vinci Code,"If you liked ""The DaVinci Code,"" you'll love the prequel. I had heard this story was good but put it off for a long time. I came away from reading it with the same feeling I got from DaVinci Code, a hunger to learn everthing I could about the people and places featured in the book and a thirst for a sequel, which is always a sign that I've read a good story.Although I didn't think that Brown did very well with the character development in this story, and this book didn't have as many shocking moments as ""DaVinci Code,"" I enjoyed the story more and it was more thrilling. This book was a lot like an educated man's Robert Ludlum: fast-paced and filled with suspense, while containing everything you find in a good issue of National Geographic."
5,Rome...,Great book (page turner)! Thanks to Dan Brown I felt like I was back in Italy. People who like riddles and Rome's beauty will like it. I loved it!!! I would chose this one as well for a movie (in addition to DaVinci Code).
3,Fast Paced Conspiracy Thriller,"I enjoy well-crafted conspiracy stories with lots of plot twists and action. Angels and Demons holds up quite nicely as a gripping novel, rich on plot and strong on characterizations. Author Dan Brown hits the ground running with the action and takes the reader on an exciting adventure.The setting for the book starts in Rome and the main protagonists, Harvard professor and art historian Robert Langdon and scientist Vittoria Vetra make for a great team in their attempt to save the Vatican from being blown up by an anti-matter bomb. The ancient brotherhood of the Illuminati, were an intriguing study in religious fervor, dogmatic ideology, and betrayal, making for a magnificent nemesis.Angels and Demons is indeed a page turner from beginning to end. I finished the book in one setting and consider the reading experience to be a fascinating and highly entertaining thrill ride."
3,Okay...,"I started to read this book with a vigor and then it took me a few weeks to get through the rest. I did enjoy this one but I can not compare it to ""Da Vinci Code"" as I have yet to read it. I did like the details of the Vatican and the history but I do wish it focused more on the history facts. I really only read it because Ewan McGregor is in the movie and I was more interested in his character than Robert Langdon's. I deffinitly felt more concern for McGregor's character."
5,great quick read,"dan's style of writing is great. quick, easy read, he kept me turning the page. Rob is such a great character. i felt like i was in rome."
5,Best Book I've Ever Read!!!,This is absolutely the best book I've ever read. This was the first Dan Brown book I read and I am hooked! I would rather read the book than watch the movie and this book proved that to me. Much better than the movie!
3,Very GOOD book (but not Great),"After I read the Da Vinci Code I felt that I had to read all of Dan Brown's books, so I started with Angels & Demons and thought it was a very good book, but felt that it was very similar to the Da Vinci Code only using science instead of art as the premise of the story.I was hooked to the story until I realized that everything happens in just one day and how Robert Langdon keeps escaping death (on the helicopter) Please don't even get me started!!!It is a good book and I highly recommend it, just be forewarned that the ending even though i's very good and you'll be very surprised it might be a little bit hard to swallow."
5,Awesome book!!,"I absolutely loved this book! I read this before ""The Davinci Code"" and I'm very glad I did!! It was very engaging, exciting, and entertaining. I also like that Dan Brown puts as many facts as he can in the book to make it more interesting. That being said, it is fiction, and should be read as such! I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes mystery thrillers, very much worth the money!"
2,"interesting, if preposterous, premise",Brown comes up with fascinating story ideas but his execution is sub-par. Too many breathless adjectives. He appears to be writing for a t.v. movie and takes too little care with his prose.
5,Thrilling!,"If you enjoy action and thrillers, you'll love this book! From the first to the last chapter, I couldn't help but to eat it all up. The main character, John Langdon, reminds me of a cross between Carl Jung and Indiana Jones. While I didn't verify his facts nor cared to, I found this book to be similar to a Die Hard movie. Full of action with incredible stunts. If you read this book for the entertainment aspect and not for facts, you'll have a great read from beginning to end!"
3,Good story until.........,"I was thoroughly enjoying this book, really I couldn't put it down, until chapter 125, page 633. Once I finished reading this page and the next I was about to throw the book into the trash. I won't spoil it but it seems to me Dan Brown rushed through this part, creating a totally ridiculous event that defies logic and reason. I returned to the book 2 weeks later to finish, which I did last night, but the awe and thrill I felt until chapter 125 was gone. I read the remainder of the story which was just as incredulous as page 633 and on. I cannot describe my disappointment in how this book ended. Maybe Dan was struggling to make a deadline? Did he have a vacation planned and wanted to finish this beforehand? Did he die and the book was finished by a college kid? I guess 77 bad pages out of 710 isn't all that terrible in an otherwise excellent tale. I just wish they'd been somewhere in the middle of the book rather than at the end. Caveat emptor!"
5,Very good book,"You learn a little bit about Robert Langden, like how he first got into solving these symbol crimes, I wish I would have read this before the Da Vinci Code (another good book). There is a huge twist towards the end and it is a must read. Keeps you turning the pages."
2,Less then mediocre,"Just like the DaVinci code the book is filled with innacuracies, does this guy really do any research?? Too many errors to even bother, he can't even get one Italian sentence spelled correctly, are you kidding me????"
3,"Good Entertainment, with flaws","Dan Brown tells a good story. He isn't the best writer in the world, in fact, his characters are one-dimensional and his situational descriptions are far too light. However, the story is fun and entertaining. After a slow start with a plot line that is scientific and technical, the story jumps over to the Vatican where the story really starts to take off. I like how he portrays the battle between science and religion through the eyes of different characters. The ending keeps you guessing with a variety of twists and turns. Most of this book contains action sequences that are very far fetched and un-realistic. However, that's entertainment. If you have a few hours to kill on a rainy weekend, and want to travel to Italy for a fun adventure, read this book and you won't be disappointed."
5,Amazing,"When I read this book, I had a hard time deciding if it trumped The Da Vinci Code. I thought it was that good. The plot and characters were so intertwined and contributed to the overall storyline. I still find it hard to believe that Dan Brown had to write something like the Da Vinci Code to get recognised. This was a good enough book to do it for him."
3,"If you read one Dan Brown book, read ""The Da Vinci Code""","Yes, it's just a novel. And I REALLY enjoyed the Da Vinci Code, which I read first. But ""Angels and Demons"" and the ""Da Vinci Code"" are essentially the same book--same plot devices, same cut-out characters, same breakneck pace. The Da Vinci Code, however, works much better--primarily because it deals with art, which is open to interpretation. Angels and Demons deals with science, which is either factually correct or it's not. Even the religious history is error-prone. Small example--yoga is not a Buddhist discipline; it's Hindu. Maybe I'm just a tough nut, but the suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy the thrill ride of this book kept getting jerked away."
4,There's a lot to like about this book...,"Page-turner... Will keep you up late at night... Can't put it down... Fast paced... More than worth the money... How books should be written... In this book, Dan Brown displays his talents more than in any of his other books. You absolutely must read this book before reading Davinci Code. This book should have been the one made into a movie. You will see a master writer in every page. You finish this book wondering what the hell is going on in Mr. Brown's life that possessed him to write this book. It's clever, intelligent, thrilling, and thought provoking. This is a book that will stay with you long after you've finished it. Others criticize the ending, but when a book is this good, any ending to it will be hard to accept, because you want it to keep going. We are lucky enough that Mr. Brown does keep it going with more books in the series...Davinci."
3,Almost an identical of Da Vinci Code !!!!,"The first book that i have read by Dan Brown was the Da Vinci Code i like it so i bought the Angels & Demons which was the first book of Robert Lagton series .I was disappointed because the book is almost identical in plot whith the Da Vinci code , that makes the book boring and predictable .The book its not bad for those who whish to read it first, but i dont really know if they would like the Da Vinci code after reading this one .Another drawback of this book is that the end is not well written and it look like Dan Brown was on harry to finish it"
5,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ.,"I just finished this book like, five minutes ago, and I thought it was amazing. I am Catholic, and I would recommend this book to everyone; I am letting a friend from work read this book b/c I told her how amazing it was. This book goes into so much detail of everything. The murders, the churches, and the characters. It is absolutly amazing. Please, read this book. It is just amazing for all to read. I am going to start The Da Vinci Code tomorrow, and I have high hopes that it will be just as good, if not better than this book."
3,First 2/3rds: GOOD; Ending: NEEDS WORK,"The first 2/3rds of Angels & Demons reads a bit like a script from the television show ""24"". Brown quickly wisks the reader from one tension-laced scenario to the next in the protaganist's (Robert Landon's) journey. Brown's incorporation of paintings, sulptures, historic sites, and the legend of the Illuminati is also enjoyable. I anxiously read through the first two acts of the book pondering the possible resolution.And in the resolution lies the problem. Some of the scenarios depicted in Angels & Demons' resolution go beyond the limits of credulity to the point of being ridiculous, laughable. The book with a less sensational conclusion would make for the ideal summer read. Unfortunately, the preponderance of ""yeah right"" moments in the third act, debilitates Angels & Demons.Overall a mediocre read."
5,Escellent,Having read The DiVinci Code first did in no way ruin this fantasticly plotted adventure of Robert Langdon. Great plot and even better twist of the conclusion kept me guessing till the finalle was written. I'd suggest this to any who liked the DiVinci Code.
2,Promising start...,"This book started out promising--some of the characters were interesting (if not believable or even likable) and the clash of science and religion had definite potential, but it failed miserably in development. The characters never matured enough for you to care about them and the plot fizzled completely, culminating in several completely unrealistic situations."
1,"Sax Rhomer, where are you now that we need you?","I got about 1/4 of the way through and stopped. The amazement that the Illuminati should still exist baffled me. The characters were childishly protrayed as was the physics. I hated the very short chapters. It made the prose choppy and distracting. I guess in the days of MTV and the quick cut one might expect that an author might try it, catering to the miniscule attention span. The story reminded me of the Fu Manchu novels but those novels were better written."
5,Thrilling adventure,"Angels and Demons is a thoroughly engaging thriller. It's one of those wonderful books that grabs your attention right at the start and takes you on a wild ride all the way to the end, while keeping you tethered to reality with fantastic factoids. At times the action left me breathless, if not squirming with anticipation, like a great rollercoaster ride. Just when I started to relax the action would take a sharp turn and leave me hanging by my well-gnawed fingernails. Don't try to read this if you have any other plans or you'll never get to them. This is a real page-turner."
1,absurd,"This book reads like the screenplay to a very bad soap opera. Towards the end it gets so melodramatic that I am suprised Brown did not get sick writing it. I will not even go into the lack of historical accuracy. There are two errors, though, which struck me as particularly heinous (both are rather central to the plot). The notion of a Catholic priest adopting a child is absurd. And since when has the Catholic Church been a proponent of in vitro fertilization? But then, Dan Brown did go to Exeter."
1,Poorly written novel insults reader's intelligence,"I would guess that this was a first draft of the Da Vinci Code that was deemed too poor a work to be published and then put out to cash in on the success of the Da Vinci Code. In it the author tries to get the reader to accept characters, their actions, and events that are just too implausible. I don't mind a writer making things up, playing with facts and in general messing with the readers head. This is a novel after all. However, Brown's characters are motivated by such cliches and vapid beliefs that I was unable to accept them and allow myself to enter the world of this novel. I won't cite specific examples lest I spoil someone else's enjoyment, but helicopters and virgin births are some prime examples. I read this to get some background for The Da Vinci Code and I never would have finished it without a determined effort."
3,Unsatisfying ending,"The book is interesting, fast paced but has a very unsatisfying and inprobable ending. I am asking myself: ""Do you realy expect me to believe that?"""
1,Must Have Been Written By a Sixth Grader,"This book is a major waste of time. I don't know what was more shaky, his science or his religion. In either case this book is poorly written to boot. If you are interested in wasting your time and money, then by all means buy this book!"
1,trash to the trash,Interesting premise but poorly written. You can see the formula writing especially after the DaVinci Code. Don't understand what all the raves are about.
2,"Angels, Demons need Editor","I don't know what happened between ""Angels and Demons"" and ""The DaVinci Code,"" but anyone who expects to find a worthy precursor to the Code will be disappointed. The prose limps; the plot is chaotic; there are countless bits of narrative that don't ring true (e.g., an extremely bright young girl raised in an orphanage asks, ""What does 'adopted' mean?""); and the endless ending(s) are as tedious as the twenty codas of those second-rate pieces of classical music that won't quit. I can only conclude that Dan Brown underwent an editorial transplant at some point, with excellent results. It's too bad that his publishers felt it necessary to trade on the success of ""The DaVinci Code"" by reissuing this very weak earlier effort."
4,Make a better movie?,"This is Robert Langdon's first adventure. You can see a lot of the same elements in this story that Brown had fine tuned by the time he wrote his monster best seller. I'm usually the last person in the world to say this but I think it may make a better movie. Of course, Hollywood can still screw it up really bad. I just think there was a lot, and I mean a lot of visuals in the book that was directly related to the story. Having never been to Rome I was thankful for this,however, it does make for a long read at times. I just think it could flow better in a movie format. All in all, a fun read. Expect more puzzles, mystery, conspiracy, etc, etc that you came to love in Da Vinci. If you loved that book you will enjoy this one."
4,Angels and Demons - Good but could be better,"I read Angels and Demons and thought that it was pretty good. It was a little predictable but still interesting. I think the most interesting thing is the history behind and the facts you can gain from reading it, but also the story was good. I'm still looking forward to see the movie version (The Da Vinci Code) when it comes out in May."
5,A real suspense thriller!!!,"Angels and Demons is defenitly the best book ever!!! Angels and Demons starts off with a man named Leonardo Vetra. He was a physicist at CERN which is the worlds largest scientific research facility. He died due to the fact that the murderer wanted his eye and the man was branded on the chest with a certain name. The name was ""Illumaniti"" and thats basically how it starts off. Just in case you don't know who the Illuminati's are I'll explain. The Illumanti's are an ancient secret brotherhood society. I won't tell you more because reading the book is much better and do read it!! It's a MUST!! So for now, until I read a better book, (which I think I won't) Angels and Demons will still stay at number 1 and I defenitly plan on reading The Da Vinci Code!!!!!!!!"
1,Have not received the book.,"It has been a long time, yet I have still not received this book. I did go through the process of notifying Amazon through e-mail. They were then suppose to forward the e-mail to the sender. I still have heard nothing. I appreciate You notifying me, so I could again attempt to get the book. I hope You can assist me with this process.SincerelyMary"
4,Even better if you plan to visit Rome some day.,"I didn't get into this in the same way as Davinci Code but it is very interesting, especially if you are going to Rome where most of the audio book is centered. It's a little 'futuristic' with a superfast jet, falling out of a helicopter without a parachute and living, etc., but it will hold your interest on a long drive. Long book."
4,Not as controversial as DVC but better,"A&D is the 1st of the RL series but somehow, it gained recognition after the more controversial DVC, which seemingly attacked a particular religion. A&D is a good read,& I actually find it faster paced than its RL sequel, but the only disappointment is that the author seems to be following a certain formula in writing. The A&D characters & events are parallel with the DVC, almost one-on-one. & even the twists & climaxes are quite predictable. If you have read one, you know what to expect with the other. Nonetheless,I enjoyed reading A&D and have no regrets spending some late nights."
4,Just...AMAZING!,i'm not a regular reader but this book grasped me from the very first chapter. This book is an amazing thriller filled with amazing clues and actual facts that really keep your mind thinking until the very end. I look foward to reading the Da Vinci Code!
4,So good!,"I too read this book after the da vinci code, and I was not disappointend. It is as much of a page turner as da vinci! Dan Brown is a very gifted author, and I look forward to reading more of his books!"
2,Not worthy of the hype,"A staggeringly-handsome-and-not-as-intelligent-and-you-might-think-for-teaching-at-Harvard professor meets stunningly beautiful and limber Italian, female physicist for 24-hour jaunt through Rome's biggest tourist traps to save world from...blah...blah...blah...This is the Dr. Suess version of Umberto Eco's 'Foucault's Pendulum' and 'The Name of the Rose'.It's amazing how much better a Professor of Semiotics can write. Do your mind a favor and read Eco instead."
1,What a waste of time!,"Unfortunately this book is only being sold due to the success of The Davinci Code. Dan Brown was obviously still working on his ""craft"" when he was writing the book. It was far-fetched, ludicris,boring and so not the page turner. I got to the last 25 pages and really didn't care anything about the characters,so rather then waste any more of my precious hours on this earth, I chucked the book in the bin. Four of my fellow co-workers finished the book, told me the ending and ALL expressed disappointment. Many comments were down right vicious in their loathing. PLEASE, do not spend your money and especially not your lifes remaining heartbeats on this book. It really is that bad."
2,the only angels you see in this book is in the title,"A much over-rated book by a much over-rated author. OK, you learn a bit about the Illuminati, and the Freemasons society, but other than that, pure drivel! The author builds some sense of suspense, but then, nothing happens!It seems that the only ones who really liked this book were people who rarely, if ever read!I was going to read the Da Vinci Code, but after reading this thing, why bother?It seems the author is more interested in gettting his misguided point across, than writing a thriller!"
5,Great Read!,I read this book before the DaVinci Code movie was released. I found it to be even better written than the DaVinci Code. Anyone who has read one of Dan Brown's books and liked it would certainly like this book as well!
3,"Dry, clinical book","I am disappointed with this book, despite having high expectations after watching the movie, and appreciating the subject matter (Illuminati, antimatter), mystery, plot. In my opinion, this book was dry and clinical. I felt no empathy for the characters, and the plot lacked a kind of beat and suspense. There were no ""hooks"". Instead, it clinically described the scene and characters, rather than having a kind of visual representation, or literature, or a feeling that helps me to empathize with the characters or imagine scenes, like watching a movie. Good database (real art, places) and research from Dan Brown, just pretty dry until the very end."
3,Good exposition but a lazy finish,"I read this book after already reading The Da Vinci Code by the same author. It seemed to me that both books started off strong, with good exposition and a compelling story line. Unfortunately, both felt rushed and clumsy in the end. It was as though the author were a student up against a midnight deadline and just whipped off a few last chapters to close. Lousy endings, but a fun read for 80% of the book."
2,Dan Brown = Cheese...,"Give me a break! I was expecting a well-written and somewhat believable novel; instead, I felt like I was trapped in an all-too-predictable soap opera. Dan Brown is a crappy writer and persuaded me, via ""Angels and Demons,"" to steer clear of ""The Da Vinci Code.""I admit, I was frightened at first by the hype surrounding the novels, but I foolishly ignored my instinct. Don't make the same mistake I did! As Oscar Wilde said, ""Popularity is the crown of laurel which the world puts on bad art."""
4,Modern science and Ancient Religion,"Fast faced novel, brilliantly maintained suspense till the end. Shortly, murder at CERN by ancient brotherhood also suspecting explosive anti-matter stolen and some one is using that to destroy the Vatican City. Time is ticking, and Electoral College is busy in selecting the Pope, but four favourites of future Pope were missed.To save that four favourites, American history professor Rabert Longdon and young lady scientist Vittoria raced to the Rome.Searching at the achieves and finding the 400 year old path of illuminati to stop the brutal killings of the Favourites won't allow to put down the book.Finding and disposing the antimatter canister is unbelievably Hollywood style. Better not to discuss about that.After reading this book, definitely one would feel to visit the Rome and trys to look into the history, religion with some interest."
2,Over-hyped & Overrated,"Hmm...When reading Angels & Demons I felt like I was watching a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, which is exactly why I didn't like it. Like watching a film by the infamous producer I was forced to suspend my disbelief beyond tolerable reason. I was forced to believe that these unbelievable events could be resolved in 24 hours. Above all, I was forced to contend with this pale thin plot formula for the length of about 570 pages.Now I know you're asking why I bothered to finish this book. For one thing, to Dan Brown's credit, it is undeniably a page-turner. The puzzle solving was at least interesting, despite the knowledge of Brown's historical inaccuracies. Otherwise, the character were more-or-less one dimensional and cliched.The only reason I picked this book up was because of all the hype surrounding it and its follow-up, ""The Da Vinci Code."" I am saddened to find that so many people can in fact be wrong about what is considered good literature."
4,Just a bit of fun,"First of all, I would like to say that I enjoyed this book immensely - because it is a real page turner, and Dan Brown really knows how to write a good story.For all the people who may be turned off by the reviews that point out the factual inaccuracies and impossibility of the actions of characters, don't be. Who cares if a few facts are incorrect? Most people aren't going to know, and why bother pointing them out to the world, and spoil the book? I don't think Dan Brown intended Angels and Demons to be a reference point for scholars, just a novel a person can sit down with, and have a darn good time. If you want to know more about the things he talks about (e.g. the symbolism, the Illuminati, the Masonics, etc), go to a library."
5,One of the Best Books I Ever Read!,I could not put this book down. It is perhaps the most gripping novel I have ever read. My wife is reading it now and feels the same way. It is MUCH better than the DaVinci Code. You will not regret buying this book.
2,"Dan, stop while you're ahead!","While at times as interesting as The Da Vinci Code, this novel cannot keep up the frantic pace, and ends up being about 75 pages too long. I kept on thinking (perhaps hoping) that the book was over, but in fact, it kept going like the Energizer Bunny. My two chief gripes, other than the last two chapters, are the intrusion of a hyperplane in an otherwise 2000's timeframe novel. What is this? A cheap way to make the novel last only 24 hours? Next time, make the hero a resident of France... Also, why allow a hero to fall 10,000 feet to certain death and let him live? Sure, it makes for a longer book, but no one believes it as a solution. It's just too miraculous.Yes, I liked the mysterious writing, and yes, I liked the curious methods of killing the cardinals. But after a while, I wanted the book to be over, and it kept going and going...."
4,Fun Read,"Well-written and very interesting mix of facts and supposition. Not quite as good as ""The Da Vinci Code"" but thoroughly entertaining."
4,Loved the creativity,"I bought this after I watched The Da Vinci Code. I don't read much, so sometimes I got impatient reading the descriptive parts so I could get to the next action scene in the book, but the descriptive parts actually bring much background and meaning to the action scenes. There is not much background information provided in movies, so it was nice to have in the book. The book also lets me re-read portions that are too intense to read just once."
4,Anges & Demons,"This book was purchased for my son, he has never taken an interest in reading until someone introduced this book to him. It has been very fascinating and interesting to him to the fact that he has already completed this book. for someone who has never taken a liking to reading and has competed this book in such short time, it has to be a great book."
1,Neither angels nor demons,"It is very long and full of details and information irrelevant to the core story.The ending (from getting into the helicopter to the end) does not match the pace of the rest of the book: it seems that the author got tired of writing and wanted to bring it to a closure as soon as possible. The priest suddenly undergoes a change of character - he becomes evil, he leaves the hero in the helicopter with the ""bomb"" and no parachute.And the hero's fall through the air looks completely farfetched: some square feet of cloth would really slow down his fall enough to simply plundge into the river? As far as I know, falling into water from high above feels as falling against concrete."
4,An excellent read-- equal style to Da Vinci Code,"Seeing as how much of the recent popularity of ""Angels & Demons"" stems from Brown's success with ""The Da Vince Code"", I'll let you in on a little secret; if you enjoyed the ""Da Vinci Code"", you'll undoubtedly enjoy ""Angels & Demons.""Brown continues his sharp, casual verbal style, and never ceases to pour on a healthy sampling of anecdotes. It is no wonder that such an interesting storyline as this was adapted into a movie.His characters are actually MORE developed by the end of the book than are the characters in his more popular novel, making this book, ironically, a better read.I would recommend this book to almost anyone, especially fans of the ""Da Vinci Code"""
4,Twice that of the Da Vinci Code,"""The Da Vinci Code"" was VERY good, but seems boring compared to ""Angels and Demons."" I was skeptical of Dan Brown as a writer after reading ""Digital Fortress"" which seemed simplistic by comparison prior to reading ""Angels and Demons.""""Angels and Demons"" however, solidifies Dan Brown's place as a strong up and comer in New Fiction. Great plot about a made up conspiracy to overthrow the Catholic Church that brilliantly blurs the lines between religion and science. All the classic elements of a great story are rolled up into a neat pile-driving plot that doesn't let up until the very end.Different than DVC, this time Dan Brown gets the reader with a stellar climax about that involves on of the main characters in the book! Hats off, stellar effort, stellar achievement!"
3,a ripping yarn,"This is a great page turner but do not expect great literature. The plot involves an ancient cult, a futuristic science research center and the rituals of the Vatican. There is even a little romance thrown in, but it is very restrained (no bodice ripping here). Suspend your disbelief and you will enjoy this tale in short order. Perfect summer reading. I will probably read the Da Vinci Code based on this showing."
4,Exciting and thought-provoking!,"I love any book dealing with the legendary Illuminati (which I believe, to some degree, actually exists in some form or another). And Dan Brown, as usual, created a great story with plenty of intrigue as well as plot twists. It's only problem might be in the fact it was a bit too long. Sometimes it is better to have exciting books a little faster in pace and shorter in pages, such as ""Darkeye"". Though not as great a book as ""Angels and Demons"", it is a good example of how you can have an exciting book without too many pages to deal with."
3,I DON'T BUY IT,"I was so happy reading this book. It is well-written with plenty of little known Catholic facts and non-stop action. The last part of the book was where I started having trouble. The ending was not consistent with the characterization that Dan Brown had developed. It went from a wonderful book - the best I've read in a long time - to one where the reader had to suspend belief to finish. Dan, work harder on the ending and I'll buy everything you write. Right now I'm afraid to read any more of your books for fear the ending will sag."
3,good read?,"I was disappointed once again with Dan Brown's story telling. (again the ending) But once again congratulate him on coming up with interesting story ideas. I felt the realism kept getting compromised with the plug-in danger scenes that kept the hero inches from facing his doom. It just seems so stock. Still, ""Angels And Demons"" makes a good read if you're not expecting too much."
3,"A hack, but an entertaining one.","Dan Brown books are so formulaic that it is not even worth the time to complain about it. If you cannot swallow genre chestnuts, look elsewhere, this is not the book for you. If you like your formula backed up with cool bits of semi-legitimate historical puzzles and religious research, then it may be exactly what you you hoped to find.Angels and Demons is a lot like a roller coaster-- even though you know the big hill is coming, it still is a lot of fun to stick your hands up in the air and scream. There are no surprises here, but who cares? Buckle in, and enjoy the ride."
2,No More Italics!,Will someone please disable the italic setup and the exclamation point key from Mr. Brown's computer?
3,A typical Brown book,"As with all of Brown's books, you have to cut the guy some slack for poetic license. He's writing a work of fiction, and while it would be nice that he crossed his ""t's"" and dotted is ""i's,"" folks, it just ain't gonna happen. By now this mistakes are ledgendary (the fact that Princess Di got married in St. Paul's and not Westminster---that was Da Vinci---the use of Dum instead of Deum---A&D---the myriad other spelling mistakes), but if you can get around these, you've got a fast-paced page-turner. Not since The Bark of the Dogwood have I so enjoyed a book. While I'd recommend A&D, just be alert to the fact that it's a Dan Brown book and not an encyclopedia."
5,Very Suspensful Book,"This book will leave you on the edge of your seat, I could hardly put the book down once I started reading it. It takes you through secret societies and leaves you hanging until the very end of the book."
3,Not as interesting as Da Vinci Code,"I read The Da Vinci Code first and loved it so I thought that this one would be as good. It is only exciting in the middle fifth of the book. The beginning drags on and on with too much ""set up"" before the action starts. The ending is completely impossible and then, after the climax of the plot, it rambles on and on for about 50 more pages. It was disappointingly boring."
3,Read this one first!,"I read Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE before reading ANGELS AND DEMONS as I'm sure is the case with many people. However, I feel that if I had read this less popular novel first, I may have enjoyed it more.I agree with some of the other reviews that Brown's formula for these novels never changes. In addition, I almost feel like he threw the end because he got tired of what he was doing. Some of these problems may stem from the fact that it was his first novel of this type and he wasn't sure where to go. I feel that by the time he got around to writing DA VINCI, he was more comfortable with how to mesh the suspense and ""history"" in a novel of this kind.If I had read this first, I would not have been familiar with the brilliant writing that I experienced while reading THE DA VINCI CODE. Subsequently, I may not have been as disappointed in ANGELS AND DEMONS.This was still a good novel, but I certainly would not recommend it as my top choice for a weekend read."
4,very intelligent piece of fiction,"Dan Brown has done it for me again, after reading the Da Vinci Code I thought that the book was a masterpiece in the way the story played out, the development of the characters and the way it was written and that it never bogged down and became tedious to read. I though it couldn't get much better than that but I had a growing respect for Dan Brown so I picked up Angels and Demons to see what else he could do. Even though the story line, with a Harvard professor being called to a murder scene around the world for his knowledge in symbology was a little farfetched, it was intelligent reading. He had good theories that were very entertaining and, even sorting through all the dialogue, it was a action-packed and fast-paced story that left you wanting more."
4,Very Similar to The da Vinci Code.....,"Ok I have one question: Does the plot to Angels and Demons not sound like the same plot to the da vinci Code? While they are not identical they are incredibly similar. Someone calls Robert Langdon (while sleeping), gives him some startling info and then he rushes off to solve the mystery. Which wouldnt be a problem if he didn't also happen to try to solve the murder with the victims daughter or granddaughter and so on. It's just a little too coincidental. And not to mention that the antics that Robert gets involved in often seem a little to far fetched. But the reason I give it 4 stars is the book is entertaining. The research Dan Brown does for his books is also amazing."
2,Great at first,"Starts off great until 2/3 of the way through it, like when the man jumps out of a helicopter with a TARP and makes it to the ground. it was like Dan Brown fell a sleep and clive Cussler took over!"
2,One to many twist and 50 pages to long.,"An excellent book from 1 - 450 pages, was a real page turner. Intriguing characters and great stroy line. Me and my wife were in Europe at the time and actually seeing the sites that were described in the book was amazing.The last 50 pages was aweful, book should ended before the final twist that didn't really need to be written. I would have given this book 5 stars if not for the horrible and unneeded ending."
4,His best work,"After starting with the Da Vinci code, I have since read almost all of Dan Brown's work. This one stands out as his best. More excitement and mystery than any of his others. A truly enjoyable read."
2,Da Vinci Code - Doppel,"It may have come before Da Vinci Code, but I couldn't stomach them both, especially with the Freemasonry & Catholic Church connections in both.Formula writing is one thing, but a little originality would go a long way."
1,Reads like a bad Steven Segal movie,"I read The da Vinci Code first and loved it like the rest of America. Angels & Demons was a total let down. It starts off good, but as it progresses it becomes so highly unbelievable that I lost interest."
5,Awesome!,"I picked this book up after reading The Da Vinci Code, looking for more from Dan Brown, and I was not sorry! Technically, this is the first adventure starring Robert Langdon, but I read it second, and it didn't really matter. Once I got past a little bit of a slow beginning at the Swiss research facility, the book was a great exciting ride that kept me up late and got me up early until I finished it. The book stayed with me for days afterward, and I wanted more, more, more..."
3,The Da Vinci Code Was Better,"In this prequel to The Da Vinci Code, Robert Langdon comes face to face with the possibility that an ancient organization (the Illuminati), thought to be inactive for many years, may still be a force to be reckoned with. Brown goes right to the heart of the battle between religion and science. I don't want to ruin it for other readers by giving away too many details, but there were a few interesting facts (?) put forward. (I wonder how many readers pulled out a one-dollar bill to study the back after Langdon's explanation of the symbols. I did.) This was a fairly interesting read, but I found myself skimming pages at about the halfway point. The scene in the Church archives was particularly tedious. The pace picked up considerably toward the end and led to a very exciting conclusion. If I hadn't read and enjoyed The Da Vinci Code, I doubt I would have chosen to read Angels And Demons. I thought The Code was much better."
3,"Not bad, but also not very good","The plot wasn't big, but his books are practically all expository dialogue. It goes: run away from the bad guy, then sit in the car/plane/train as Dan Brown's Sue sits and talks about random history mixed with conspiracy theories and explains how it's related to the current situation.Anyway, people have made Dan Brown plot generators, so he's somewhat predictable, the main character's an idealized self-insert, and he goes heavy on the info-dumping. If you're expecting something high-brow, you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for a popcorn flick, you might enjoy it. I didn't like it, but sales don't lie; lots of people have enjoyed it.Overall-Actually if you are going to start with one this is probably his best one so far."
3,More Demonic than Angelic,"If you liked the Da Vinci code, you will like Angels and Demons too, but not nearly as much. I skip-read a lot of parts because it was very predictable and I was already very familiar with the exact same formula from Da Vinci Code. It would have probably been better for me had I let more time elapse between my reading of the DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons. I read the two about 3 months apart."
3,Sort of good!,"Angels and Demons, a book which I think isn't exactly well written but I must say it it a compelling story. Though I did work out where the antimatter was in no time- I haven't been to university......yet, I'm 15 and certainly no genius and it slightly frustrated me when Robert Langdon didn't work out where the antimatter was. But if you enjoy Dan Brown's books then its probably a good read!"
2,"Check your common sense at the door, and hang on","The book to which The Da Vinci Code is the sequel. (Published before DVC, so not technically a prequel, if ""prequel"" were a technical term.) Almost laughable in terms of character, plausibility, and dialogue (the last line especially); almost admirable in terms of how to craft 700 pages of pure page-turning suspense - ""almost"" because it gets so obvious and heavy-handed.If you hated DVC, you'll hate this one too; if you liked DVC, that's no guarantee you'll like this one - it's definitely the less polished of the two. But if you want to just turn off your common sense and get swept away in a mad chase and a silly puzzle (punctuated with some gruesome murders), then you'll probably love it."
4,Angels & Demons,"Buyer was great to deal with, mailed item very promptly and had no problems at all! Very Dependable!"
1,perhaps the worst-written bestseller of all time?,"I struggled through the ludicrous and risible, far-fetched and preposterous Da Vinci Code, then thought I would give this author one more chance, despite the horrendous and mind-numbing dead weight of his cliche-laden writing style, by trying this book. Big mistake. It is quite possibly the worst-written book I've ever read. I struggled, waded, crawled and staggered my way through it. Then when I finished it - what a relief - I opened the window and threw the book out into the street. I'm very glad to say it was raining at the time. I will never read another word written by this author again. Yet, strangely, the book left me mildly optimistic: if a bestselling author can dredge up this dross, and write so appallingly badly, and get away with it, then surely there is hope for all of us."
1,A long serie of mistakes,"a) chapters are too many and too short which is unnerving as you have to keep jumping back and forth from one scene to the other.b) half of the sentences in Italian were wrong...a suggestion to Dan: if you don't know a language, please avoid using it!c) some scenes are just ridiculousd) can anyone explain me how a Catholic priest can adopt a daughter?????"
4,The use of Italian: mistakes aplenty,"This is a comment I inteded to address to the author himself or to the person representing him, but unfortunately i could not get hold of a valid email. So I decided to post here instead.I will not dwell on the contents or the plot, which have been commented upon by others. The point I would like to make here is the inesplicably erroneous use of the Italian language in Angels and Demons. As a student of translation and interpreting and as a native speaker of Italian, I cannot refrain from sharply criticizing the author for clearly not having had Italian quotes checked and probably relying solely on his own knowledge or possibly an online automatic translator? Hardly any of the Italian used in the book is correct. Most of it is in fact ridicolous or makes no sense whatsoever. It is a shame that a bestselling author who claims having researched thoroughly could not make an effort to ensure the correct use of a foreign language."
2,Come on,"I'm continually surprised by the popularity of this book, as well as its even more well known brother The Da Vinci Code. The only purpose for a book of this kind is to provide diversion from the discomfort of a long plane ride. This book lacks any real character development and boasts the most unbelievable story lines possibly ever written. If asked, I assume Dan Brown would admit that this is not a work of literary genious, but mere literary candy to be enjoyed at the detriment of your own mental health. After all, any author with any intellectual honesty would admit that a book that ends every chapter with a cliff hanger must lack true plot development. Life is too short to suffer through the empty experience of this book when there are so many great books that you would undoubtedly enjoy more."
1,Big disappointment,After reading the Da Vinci Code I thought that Dan Brown had something special which lacked in other fictional authors. I started reading Angels and Demons and it just did not hold my interest at all. The main problem is that it jumps right into the plot without developing the characters. It also mixes like a thousand plots at the same time. I didnt even read further than page 100.
2,"Oh, Please...","I think the worst part about this book is that people are considering everything it says as absolute truth. It's FICTION, folks, an old-fashioned thriller. Old fashioned is right: I felt as if I were in one of those boys' adventure books from the early 1900s, where Our Hero goes rushing from one crisis to another and emerging relatively unscathed by great turns of luck, complete with secret codes. All Dan Brown did was toss in some violence, sex, religious mumbo-jumbo and phobias, and voila, Tom Swift reborn!"
1,Poor,Implausible and contrived with an unbelievably singular plot line. It's difficult to NOT figure out who-done-it half way through the book. Skip this one!
1,Really amazingly bad,"I have a bad habit. Once I start a book, I finish it, Hell or high water. Only thus can I explain how I got through this one.Paul Laughlin's review is excellent but generous. The book is full of idiotic errors. The supposed geniuses who populate it are amazingly stupid. The relationship between science and the Catholic Church portrayed here is unconnected to reality. The plot twists make a Paul Bunyan story look sober and realistic.OK, we expected all that. What surprised me is how badly written it all is. The writing is clumsily manipulative. The dialog is awful: X delivers a lecture while Y repeatedly gasps in amazement at the astonishing and shocking things he says (which leave you yawning). The plot is completely predictable. I guess, from reading the other reviews, that some readers actually WERE surprised by the ending, but for me the only surprise was the absurdities Brown was eager to commit to force the story to follow its predictable rut."
1,In a fit of rage I threw it against the wall at page 510,"After the hero jumps out of a helicopter at 15,000' using only a tarp as a parachute, surviving an anti-matter explosion on the way down, only to land safely in the river where coincidently a doctor sees him land and revives him. (His third or fourth time he has escaped death today). All the while, the ""pope"", who had a parachute, is pretending a miracle has happened as he has landed atop St. Peter's to the roar of the crowd. JEEEEEEZ Get me outa here!!! Even as a movie, this would get boos."
3,"Kinda like Da Vinci code, just not as good...","This book reads like a practice attempt at writing Da Vinci code. The plot, characters, mystery, and story line are good, just not as good as da Vinci. The thing I most disliked about this book are some of the way-over-the-top things that happen that seem to be stuck in to make the plot work (i.e. supersonic airplanes, anti-matter bombs, miraculous escapes from helicopters). If you loved Da Vinc, you'll like this... similar, just not as good."
3,entertaining but not great,This is a fine read that will keep you turning the pages. I compare this to a popcorn movie--it's entertaining but the writing's fairly poor. (Brown needs to lay off on the *italics* when *people* are *speaking.*) It's just another example of popular fiction that will sell millions because it's not very challenging. Other reviews claim that this is a great book: Lolita is a great book; Moby Dick is a great book; The Great Gatsby is a great book. Please save your superlatives for something more deserving.
4,"Captivating, an all night reader","I was first introduced to Dan Brown's writing with DaVinci Codes, which I loved. When a friend let me borrow her copy of Angles and Demons, I started reading it thinking it couldn't possibly be as good as DaVinci Codes. Boy was I wrong! This is an absolute riveting book. Fast paced, well written, Brown is a masterful story teller who clearly does his research on the subject matter. This book is full of twists and turns turns which keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The only negative comment i have is that Brown repeatedly uses what I feel are very far-fetched coincidences to lead Langdon and Vittoria to figure things out. However, overall this is a book that I highly recommend. And, as an added bonus, readers can go to the Dan Brown website and see pictures of the actual sites in Rome described in the book."
4,Not great literature but great reading,"Thrilling, fast-paced, and enigmatic was the plot. Facts weaved with history, laced with fiction and action. Yes, the characters were somewhat one-dimensional and literary devices overused and maltreated. But the book was exciting. Brown does not aspire to be Tolstoy or Dickens, just thrill readers with a twisty story of intrigue and murder. Read this on your next vacation. It's a really great beach book that's hard to put down."
2,Too many cliches to list,"My one problem with some of the ""plot-driven"" books out there is this: hunky guy meets beautiful woman; together they work to unravel a mystery; they fall in love by books' end; all characters fit a formulaic mold. I have found his other books thought-provoking in the sense of what historical/comspiratorial/technological aspects he explores, but the writing is stilted and rote. There are long periods of exposition/explanation that are not very well utilized. It's as though the entire story stops to say, ""Here's todays history lesson."" It's not naturally realized. It's not enough to say it's ""fiction""; why does Dan Brown feel compelled to explain everything to us, the readers?And the ending, well: melodramatic, over-the-top, sensationalistic, cliched."
2,mildly entertaining... for people who enjoy bad writing,"The book is written in such a poor format that nearly every chapter ends with a ""surprise"" fact which any semi-intelligent person can figure out. On a few occasions, words like ""Art"" even have their own paragraph. You will find phrases such as ""despite the satisfaction in his loins"" in some of the most terribly done chapters I've read. The characterization is completely flat, the plot is predictable, and the author obviously had no confidence in the reader's capacity to think.I gave this two stars because the book was just that funny. Also, some of the scientific discussion, although painfully slow-paced, has interesting theories."
2,doesn't pull it off,"I hope I don't offend any fans of this author with my review, but I would like to warn readers. I read this book because of the comparisons with Umberto Eco and similar writers. To me, the book may have been fast paced, and informative about Rome and about the techno science details in the plot, however....frankly, it was just really ...ludicrous. I kept reading the book thinking it would get better, but the next plot twist would just get more, well, zany. If it had been written as a comedy, maybe that would have been better. But knowing this plot was meant to be dramatic and suspenseful...in the end I thought the story was, well, I can't think of another word for ludicrous. Perhaps, Mr Brown has other books that are better written. But this one was certainly a disappointment. It was readable, but certainly not great nor good. Sorry, but if you're looking for a great read...keep looking."
1,Most. Predictable. Book. Ever.,"Only resurrected due to the success of the Da Vinci Code. No question why this book was never a hit until after that one came out. More like a ""practice"" manual for Da Vinci, working out the kinks in his writing style.Book drug on forever, one of the few books that I could not wait for the ending to come."
1,dan brown on a deadline,"Dan brown woke up late one sunday afternoon and realized he needed to turn a book into his publisher by 8am monday morning. so what did he do...? he wrote this book.if you have read his da vinci code, i highly suggest you do not bother to read this book. if you compare the two you will see how PAINFULLY obvious his formula is for writing. it's like mad-libs of books. throw in a proper noun here, a verb there, and hope it turns out funny in the end.this book is silly at best; aggrivating and frustratingly bad at its worst.i couldn't stand the corny lines that he tried to pass for humor. ""you've never been to bed with a yoga master"" holy cow. i almost lost my lunch after i read that crappy line.and if he uses the phrase 'sat bolt upright' one more time i'm gonna rip out my hair.if you do not want to ruin the ending of this book, i suggest you do not read it at all."
1,Unable to suspend disbelief..at all..not one bit.,"Am I glad I checked out the reviews here so that I can feel better about not liking this book. Oy. I've tried 3 times to get beyond the first 15 pages and I just can't do it. Ditto exactly Jane Bond's earlier review! I, too, read the Da Vinci Code, which was interesting at the time, but this overwrought Angels and Demons feels like been there and done that and don't want to repeat it!"
1,Just painful,After the first 100 pages I was starting to feel the pain - that dull throbbing right before a full-blown headache. For some reason I was convinced to persevere. Someone swore it got better was worth finishing. And the experience got more and more painful. At least in Da Vinci Code the book was interesting to the halfway mark. In Angels and Demons it was over much sooner. Yet another example from Dan Brown of what authors should not do.
2,unintentionally hilarious,"First off, an admission - i read this book in 2 days and enjoyed every minute of it. But then again, I like Arnie movies - it doesn't mean i think they're good. What really makes me laugh is the reviews claiming this is an 'intelligent' thriller - whether or not Dan Brown is intelligent (and he may well be), he certainly treats the reader like an imbecile. Every two pages is a ""startling revelation"", which would be much more startling if the reader hadn't already figured it out a page and a half before ""renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon"". Brown obviously has some entertaining (if ridiculous) concepts for books, but he should employ a ghostwriter who knows how to write decent prose."
3,Much better than the Da Vinci Code,"But unfortunately, it still leaves a lot of room for improvement. Still, the book's pacing is much better, the story tighter, and there are no clues that are being stretched too long just to create suspence (points I disliked about the Da Vinci Code).Since most readers would be fimiliar with the general plot, I'd just like to mention a few points I still hadn't liked:* This is a suspense / thriller book - the ""love / sex"" scenes seemed to be out of place.* The fact of the Illuminati secrecy was established very early in the book, but once the perpetrator had been found - there was no explanation of how he was connected to this secret society, or how he put his hands on their brands, or had the knowledge of the ""Path of Illumination"".* While the historical & cultural references were fascinating, a lot of questions were raised on the accuracy of the ""facts"" behind the Da Vinci code, which makes me wonder how true - to - life they are here."
2,"Foucault's Pendulum ""Lite""","All in all, this has the feel of a wannabe. I really could not get over the kind of ""dumbed down"" feel of the stereotypical ""Harvard professor"" with his tweed schtick long enough to feel like I was reading something worthwhile. Having read Umberto Eco's ""Foucault's Pendulum"", this felt a little like the juvenile version, watered down with enough summer thriller plot cliches to appeal to the beach reader and fool them into feeling like a ""serious reader"".If you want a book that spoon feeds you a plot that shouldn't be too difficult to predict after 15 pages, this is the one for you. If you want the real read, pick up ""Foucault's Pendulum"" and commit to expanding your vocabulary and your attention span for more than is required of the 30-second commercial spot."
3,"Factful, but teachy.","Somebody at my favorite Borders store told me I had to read Angels and Demons first (before The Da Vinci Code). After reading this one, I'm not sure if I'll read the Da Vinci Code. While this book was filled with fascinating historical facts, these facts were often laid out in the form of a lecture. I felt the author was just trying to show off his knowledge, rather than sneaking it into the story subtley, so that we don't realize we are learning. This book fails the ""Show-Don't-Tell"" rule.Also, if you're going to do historical fiction, then I need to know which parts are true and which parts are made up. I can only use the true stuff to impress my friends with historical trivia at parties. Just throw in an afterword or something.However, having said all that, I kept reading the thing, so it couldn't be all bad."
4,"Angelic Plot, Demonic End","This is a wonderful thriller, full of twists, turns and mysteries galore. The story centers on the Catholic church, conspiracies, and the art world. It's a very enjoyable read but I couldn't give it a 5 because this author suffers from, what I affectionately call, Crichton Syndrome. This simply means that the book builds to amazing heights but the end is less than satisfying...in most cases, downright dumb. You'll love the book, just turn your ""suspension of disbelief"" button to high for the ending. You'll need it to believe parts of the climax."
3,"Faaaar-fetched melodrama. But thanks for trying, Dan.","Kudos to Dan Brown for the supreme intelligence he's brought to the international intrigue genre. The info on the Vatican, the various Italian artists discussed and the Illuminati is fascinating (to me, at least), and Brown is an expert puzzle-maker. But the plotting is ridiculously convoluted and, by the end, completely without plausability. (Are we actually supposed to believe that all this happens in one day? And most of it in four hours? Come on!!) Too bad. Brown is a good writer (the reader is never bored; far from it), but he's bitten off far more than he can chew here. And truth to tell, for all his intelligence, the hero's a real dud. What the voluptuous Italian heroine sees in him is the real mystery."
2,Entertaining,"I grabbed this because of the title. I love books about Angels and Demons. The back cover mentioned a guy out to save the Vatican. It sounded cool.However, it had nothing to do with either angels or demons. It was one long anti-Catholic diatribe. It criticizes the Holy See for spinning rumors then does just that itself. As a person of faith, this reader found the writer to know nothing about faith.The Vatican apologized to Galileo - publicly - about 10 years before Brown wrote his book. Science and religion CAN walk hand in hand. Today, scientists study the power of prayer and communicating with those who have passed on. The Vatican has had its own observatory in Arizona for decades. As far as faith protecting believers from all harm - that's about the silliest thing to say about a faith launched on a man who was crucified.It was entertaining. I do feel very sad for folks who think this stuff is truth."
2,You have to be kidding!,"My reactions as I read this book went from ""Ewwww!"" to ""man, this is exciting and intriguing!"" to ""Huh? Did he do any research at all?"" to ""Oh, give me a BREAK!""If you can suspend your disbelief long enough to have fun reading this airplane/beach read, well, good for you. It IS exciting. The only trouble is, it totally falls apart if you stop to think about it or actually check many of his 'facts'. As for the ending...words fail me. Dear, oh, dear."
2,Disappointing,"After finishing ""The DaVinci Code"" (a good book, but IMHO a little overrated) I bought this book. It's nothing more than a bad clone of TDVC (or maybe a rough draft, as it's older). The story and the characters are not believable. Cardinals are depicted as superstitious and gullible: in real world Cardinal are skilled politicians before being priests, and I am sure they are less prone to believe in miracles than the average believer is (well, I'm an atheist, so probably mine is not a fair vision).Moreover, as an Italian, I was bothered by the several errors in the very many Italian sentences the book contains. I think that Mr Brown could have had them corrected by an Italian, or not included them at all."
3,Same recipe as Davinci Code,"I have never read two books by the same author that had the exact same plot. Some different names, and different places but if you've read Davinci you're already read this book. This guy must have some real issues with the Catholic Church."
2,Twists and Burns?,"I must say that most of the book is enjoyable. It is a very engaging read, that makes you want to continue to read. Whether you believe all the author writes doesn't really matter, it is fun to read. However, the most important part of the book (the conclusion) is beyond belief! The author adds twists that are not needed nor believable. The book should have ended at the conclusion of chapter 123 or at least that is where it is should have stopped adding new developments. Unfortunately it doesn't. The rest of the book is the author trying hard to make ""miracles"" of his own (like how can I add another 100 pages without really writing anything worth reading). It's too bad that such a fun book for the first 400 pages has to end so poorly. I would recommend reading it, but stopping after chapter 123."
3,Was Hoping for More,I enjoyed the pace of the Da Vinci Code but was slightly disappointed by Angels and Demons. The flow of the book was okay at times but I think the author could have allowed more time to adjust and react to the final twist of the book.
3,No Da Vinci Code Here,"I read this book after reading (and loving) The Da Vinci Code. This was such a disappointment, but mostly b/c I had already read TDC. If I reviewed this book based on it's own merits I would give it 4 stars; but after reading TDC this one feels lame and very formulaic - like Dan Brown was practicing for the TDC with Angels & Demons, polished it up and put out The Da Vinci Code. The characters are so similiar, the story takes place in Europe and has another religious theme. TDC is by far his better book and I'm glad I read it first!"
3,Fast read,"It is easy to read. However, with all the publicity I expected more. This book did not really touch me. Interesting to learn facts, but dry. Good summer read thriller."
3,exploring the vatican's inner sanctum,"generally compelling read, except the ending was a little forced. the best part was the ambigrams: illuminati and earth air water fire. pretty cool. brown's not nearly as good a writer as his compeer-in-compelling, patricia cornwell. his characters tend to be writ too simply, too."
5,Watch out world Dan Brown has unleashed Robert Langdon,"The prequel to the Da Vinci Code, is a masterpiece as well. Dan Brown not only puts his readers in a car chasing never stopping thriller he also educates them at the same time. Dan Brown is a remarkable author who writes remarkable work. This book deserves a full five stars, because even though I had school work to do, I spent the entire day finishing the book. That's how I know when a book is good, when I have important assignments that I need to take care of, but oh no, I've got to finish this book.Once again Brown introduces historical content to us, and some of us may not be able to handle the content, but we should try at least. Some religious fanatics might not be able to handle it, but hey isn't that what makes up the world, a bunch of people trying to get along.Enjoy spending hours reading this one, you'll never want to put it down"
4,Engagingly provocative,"What to do if someone has been mysteriously murdered with the only clue being an indelible, if arcane, form of religious symbology? No problem. Just call the Harvard art professor/religous symbologist extraordinaire, Robert Langdon.Having read The Da Vinci Code, I was somewhat skeptical of undertaking Angels & Demons. I was somewhat unsure that it would compare, much less hold a candle, to The Da Vinci Code in terms of its proclivity for supremely suspenseful and intelligent writing. Suffice to say, it did. Despite a myriad of scenarios and events being highly implausible, Dan Brown's undeniable affinity for hyperbole(Robert Langdon's transformation into Superman during one scene notwithstanding), for all intents and purposes, serves to elevate the storyline to his characteristic high level of excitement and suspense that makes for a veritable high octane page-turner. If you enjoyed The Da Vinci Code, you're sure to enjoy Angels & Demons - perhaps even to a greater degree."
4,Enjoyable read.,"Fast paced action, a reluctant hero, a dash of romance, some food for the thought (morality and religion), this thriller follows the ""recipe"" for a bestseller. It is not a book I will keep and cherish, but I enjoyed the ride, carried away to finish reading the novel in one setting."
3,Not Dan Brown's best effort...,"I read ""angels and demons"" immediately after finishing ""The Da Vinci Code""... Maybe I shouldn't have... While I really enjoyed the research, the plot and the writing in Da Vinci, ""Angels and Demons"" failed to capture my attention the way Da Vinci did.The research in both books is excellent... Da Vinci however had a lot more game and remains one of my favorite books to date...As far as the content being objectionable to people of religious faith, one should be free to read whatever one wants, keep an open mind and forge one's own opinion..."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzz *snore* Zzzzzzzzzzzz <cough cough>,"Seems like a bubble gum rip off of Umberto Eco's ""Fouccault's Pendulum"". I haven't been able to finish it. I find myself rooting for the Illuminati to succeed where the book would be over.I really believe someone could publish the Charlotte Yellow Pages and put Dan Brown's name on it and it would make the New York Time's bestseller list thanks to the ""DaVinchi Code""."
1,Very disapponted. I do want my money back!,"This book is very disappointing. Almost all the quotations in Italian are misspelled and sometimes written in a very poor dialect. Even the names of the most important locations inside the Vatican are ridiculously misspelled. It seems like the author did not spend much time in checking names and quotations. I found this offensive! The author is not aware of the fact the Swiss Guards are only one of the two 'armies' of the Vatican. He is also not aware of the titles of the hierarchy of the 'Curia Romana'. And I have only read 130 pages... I'll keep you posted. Mr. Brown, how is it possible to contact you?"
1,Very Disappointed,"Amazon should have better control over used materials that are sold on their website. The used audiobook CD's I received were in a filthy case that was taped to hold it closed. Upon removing the tape, the case fell completely apart, the front and back covers falling away from the rings holding the CD sleeves. One of the CD's was scratched.The case also had a library label on the spine, which tells me that the seller bought it from a used book sale at a library! Probably for much less than the $8.00 he sold it for on Amazon!! I will not buy any other used materials from Amazon."
2,Fact and Fiction,"Angels and Demons, like all of Dan Brown's books are best read without taking his words as facts. If you start checking his claims, they start to crumble. 'Novus Ordo Seclorum' doesn't mean New Secular Order but rather New Order of the Centuries - and this is just one of the things that jumped at me, without even doing any in-depth checks.One of the things that bother me is that although all his characters are scientists, they talk and behave like idiots, as Dan tries to explain to his readers some scientific concepts he doesn't understand himself.Like all his books, A&D; is full of mysteries, twists and turns, some more effective than others.Overall, it's an enjoyable read for a rainy Sunday. Just don't take it too seriously"
4,Great thriller!,"Reading the synopsis, I saw the world ""Illuminati"" and I thought of the movie ""Tomb Raider"" (I don't know why), so I got the book, and read it. And this is one AWESOME book! It's the kind of book that keeps you guessing, pulls you in, making it hard to put the book down reading only half way! It's the kind of book that makes you keep guessing what's going to happened next. Reading this book, I felt like I was in Italy. And now that I've finished it, I really want to go to Vatican City to see everything mention in the book! Sadly, I would have to say, this book was probably better than ""Da Vinci's Code"". I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a great thriller/mystery."
4,"Excellent Fiction, Not Non-Fiction!","""Angels and Demons"" is a phenomenal fictional piece of literature. It tells the story of a Harvard symbologist and his adventure in trying to stop a disaster from happening in the Vatican City. It taps the lay knowledge people may have of Rome, the Vatican, and science, and creates a wonderfully intriguing book.Some people may read this book and be disappointed in the scientfic, religious, or historical inaccuracies that may escape the common reader. However, I must say that is book is not a historical account of anything! That's why it's in the ""Fiction"" section of libraries and bookstores! Take this book at face value and it will be exhilarating. Try nitpicking the story for facts and you'll be thoroughly disappointed. The choice is the readers.Overall, this book can be read in about 4 or 5 nights or 1 good reading weekend. It is enthralling as a fictional piece and can be read even after reading ""Da Vinci Code""."
3,"Good, but does he have to be so formulaic?","Positives: Well researched, original, fairly gripping.Negatives: Unnecessarily long.General comments:Despite the order the books are written in, the overwhelming majority of people will come to this book AFTER having read the Da Vinci code. While on a stand-alone basis it's not a bad book, I fail to see how a creative author could write 2 such similar books using virtually identical plot devices.Furthermore, I have read 3 of his books & they all seem to contain similar traits such as a ""brilliant"" young woman who frequently shows breathtaking naivety/stupidity.In summary: if you haven't read the Da Vinci code, then pick this up. If you have, don't waste your time on any other Dan Brown book (especially this one) until he learns a new formula...although you'll probably be waiting a long time."
1,not worth it,"If you read ""The Davinci Code"" first, don't waste your time with this one. I thought it would give me more insight on the characters of ""The Davinci Code"", and it didn't. It is the exact same plot as DC with a different setting and characters. It will truly spoil any love you have for DC and give you a very low opinion of the author who has actually written some good books. So I beg you not to destroy your mind with this crap. And, Dan Brown, do us all a favor and write and original story for once."
2,Great book 'till the end,"This was another great book by Dan Brown untill the part with the helicopter. When Robert jumps out, he so happens to grab a tarp and it so happens that the tarp is big enough to slow down his fall. He falls a few thousand feet, AND WALKS AWAY ALMOST UNHARMED!. That almost ruined the book but this ruined the book. After Robert leaves the hospital, the camcorder still works, and it confesses the whole evil plot. Like I said, great book, till the end."
4,Dan Brown has a profound writer's imagination!,"I have read The Da Vinci Code first but when I read the Angels and Demons, I have liked it more. There was never a chapter that bores you and just continues on and on for suspense."
5,Couldn't put it down,"Aside from one unbelievable event, near the end of this book,I found that i just couldn't put it down. After reading The Davinci Code I was looking for something as spellbinding, and this book far outshines his other works.If the ending of the Davinci Code left you wanting more, as it did me, you'll be more than satisifed after reading Angels and Demons."
2,"Please take a writing class, Mr. Brown.","I read Da Vinci code and enjoyed it, mostly because of the subject matter. Mr. Brown painted a vivid picture of an ancient puzzle I couldn't wait to see solved. In the rush of the mystery, I overlooked the fact that I didn't really care about any of the characters. So I picked up this book, looking for a similar rush. However, I couldn't care less about this mystery. He lost me from the very beginning. And therefore I was left with his characters, who are cookie cutter and uninteresting. Langdon is a boring man. He has no real flaws or quirks. He's just some guy. I read about how Mr. Brown wants to write another ""Langdon"" book, and I wonder what makes it a Langdon book? The name? The use of symbols? Because knowing it's a Langdon book doesn't excite me. He could call the guy whatever he wants and I wouldn't even notice he'd changed the name. His plots better be riveting, otherwise I'm lost."
2,Been There Done That,"This author redefines ""formula"" writing. Angels and Demons is essentially The Da Vinci Code with the same wafer thin characters in a different setting and slightly different plot.Great setup, just as with Da Vinci Code - this one involving a secret organization and corruption in the Vatican. But much of the action is so silly it takes away from the potential drama. Langdon's escapes are just too lame. The final one is so ridiculous I wanted to throw the book across the room. Yes, it's a novel, but it's distracting and less enjoyable to me when things get that unbelievable.However, this is certainly a page turner. If you like your novels light and cheesy, it's a fun and quick read."
2,Don't bother.,"I sort of enjoyed The Da Vinci Code, despite being skeptical of many of the ""historical facts"" embedded in the story. Angels and Demons, even though it was written before DVC, is more of the same, though less carefully written. I am not even going to finish it.If you're interested in the history of science, read The Discoverers, by Daniel Boorstin, which is non-fiction but exciting reading anyway. Only read Angels and Demons if you have already read everything else and just want to pass the time."
5,A MUST READ,"The purpose of reading a thriller is to become engulfed in it, and you do this by suspending your disbelief. This book is not for people people who simply can't sit down and read a book for the purpose of enjoyment. If you're ultra-religious, or a history buff who cannot handle an author's speculation on facts and events, then don't read this book. If you're a reader who really just wants to get lost in an amazing thriller, this is a MUST READ. I could not put this book down, and I am by no means an avid reader. In fact, this book has made me want to read more and you can be assured I will have, by the end of the summer, read all of Dan Brown's books. Ignore the other reviews. This book is GREAT. Buy it. Read it. Love it."
5,Filled a Flight Page-Turner,Love it; great; excited to go finish the last 20 pages. Page turner right from the beginning. I bought the paperback and have not read Da Vinci Code yet.
3,"Interesting, but outrageously far fetched.","I found it entertaining to read, but had to work very hard to maintain suspension of disbelief. Brown is no Mark Twain, but he's ok for a cheap thrill."
5,great ride,"I got this book on tape for a long trip this past June (19hrs) and it was great. The book was so good, I forgot about the length of the trip and the mess of traffic I was sitting in as I was so focused on what was happening. The book has a unexpected twist that I didn't see coming. Great book."
4,"AWESOME, HARD TO PUT DOWN","I loved this book, and I really love reading the reviews on it also, you can tell who are protestants and who are the catholics. It's a story, and well written. You can probably tell by my 4 star rating that I'm a supporter of John Knox. LOL. I am sure my next book will be The Lost Symbol."
5,"Angels and Demons, Audiobook","We have thoroughly enjoyed listening to the book. It arrived quickly in perfect condition. Since we travel often, we have listened to our audiobook while we ride. It's amazing how much shorter the trip is!"
3,A shill for the Illuminati,"One thing is for certain, the book shows that the Illuminati and the Church have been waring for a very long time. This novel revolves around the quest of fictional Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon to unravel the mysteries of a secret society called the Illuminati, and preclude a plot from annihilating the Vatican City using destructive antimatter. The story recounts the conflict between science and religion that brought the establishment of the Illuminati, and, after centuries of non-existence, the group is thought to have resurfaced for retribution against the Roman Catholic Church.For the serious truthseeker, I recommend [...]."
4,Dissapointing Finish,"Wow, I loved this book, that is until the last hundred pages. At the end Mr. Brown added twists and implausible senarios which took away from the well researched thrill ride of the first four-hundred pages. Angels and Demons is still a book worth reading, but not a great book."
5,The Power of Dan Brown...,"This was the first book of strong characteristic of Brown's writting style. The first 100 pages were a little bit boring but when the searching of cardinals started, it's very ""sticky"" to hands."
3,Dan Brown: Angels and Demons,"Frankly, I was disappointed with Angels and Demons. The first 3/4 of the book is riveting....but the last 1/4 is so far-fetched and so written with movie rights in mind that it turned me off. I also read the DaVinci Code...but I will not spend any more time on Dan Brown's novels---too formulaic."
5,Just finished,"Many books have great twists, but this one turns around in circles. I thought I figured it out with about 160 pages to go. The as I read on I was sure I did. Boy was I wrong! Right up there with Di vinci code. I cant decide which one I like better. But dont read this right before or after you read The Di Vinci Code. Read a different one in-between because the story lines are kinda the same. But it still was G R E A T!"
3,Too difficult to believe,"Angels and Demons is Dan Brown's style: fast, catching, with twists in the story until the end. Until there, it's ok, a nice book if you want to spare some time and forget about the world for a while.The problem with Angels and Demons is that it's ""too much"". The end, especially, is so absurd that is impossible to believe in it's story and it's kind of disappointing for who - like me - like to be ""fooled"" for a while and believe that this could be a real story.Comparing to the movie, it's better. WAY better. Especially the beggining and the understanding of the Illuminati historical facts, that are more complete in the book."
4,Angels & Demons - Great FICTION,"There may be flaws in research, and valid facts - but it is a great work of fiction. The fact that he blends science and historical facts that an average reader can relate to is a plus. This book is easily a must read to any Koontz fan, like I am. I plan on buying more of Brown's books."
3,better than The Da Vinci Code,"I clearly prefer this one, though I read the Da Vinci Code first. I am just hoping not all Dan Brown's books will (are) following the exact same recipe. It's a good summer read, even with its major flaws (latin, italian, history)."
4,Angels and Demons,Angels and Demons is definitly a good choice for anyone who likes action thrillers. the book was fast paced and was nothing but non stop action. from the first page the book had me hooked but i kind of wish i would have found out about this book before i read the sequal da vinci code. Robert Langdon takes you on a non stop adventure as he tries to unravel the mystery of 4 murdered cardinals. Each cardinal is branded with a different ancient symbol that leads langdon on his quest. Langdon searches all over Rome to stop the destruction of the city. The ending is awesome and it will keep you guessing the whole time.
1,"Dan Brown, crap peddler...","As the great Bob Marley once said: ""is Mr. Brown controlled by remote?"" The answer is ""yes."" If you are a revolutionary the easiest target is to attack a target that can't fight back. Hence, the Catholics.The book in a few words: unimaginative bird vomit, but perhaps that is isn't descriptive enough: BORING bird vomit, but don't take MY word for it, I am a professional book reviewer..."
4,Awsome book!,"The book, angels and demons i think was a very exciting fast paced book with an unexpected ending. It starts out with proffesor named robert langdon who teaches on symbology at harvard. He is asked for help identifing an anchient symbol burned onto the chest of a scientest. The book picks up pace as the reader finds out as a result of a pope who died there was an ""election"" for a new one but the anchient illuminati anti-cathlioc group had kidnaped the 4 main canidates for pope. And you find out the illuminati steals a little of antimatter, cappible of destroying the entire vatican and hurting the cathloic curch verry much. The book is basicly about that one night as it follows a crazy chase to find the 4 cardinals before its too late, and the antimatter before it destroys eveything. The end of the book revals a very intersting twist to the story, overall it is just a good book that i would say is very hard to put down."
3,Da Vinci Code's Red Headed Stepchild,Don't bother unless you really love this guy. Plot is ludicrous. There's a reason nobody read this book first.
1,My time is too valuable,"I've started this book twice now, both times getting to about the 125th page, before I've become so annoyed with the one-dimensional, wisecracking (even if only in their own heads) characters and the preposterous plot that I've put it down. After reading what even the GOOD reviews say about the silly plot twists and even sillier ending, I've decided not to waste my time picking it up again."
5,As Close To Perfection As A Book Can Be,"Thank you Dan Brown for a perfect novel! This is a book that is as beautifully constructed as the architecture it describes. Mr. Brown's detail is as glorious and rich as the art he writes about. It was a pleasure to read - intellegent, suspenseful, fast paced ... one runs out of adjectives before they can adequately describe this book. A MUST read that I will be proud to have on my bookshelf for years to come."
5,Better than DaVinci Code,"I somehow ended up reading this book before The DaVinci Code (unlike most people I know). Out of the two, I definitely think that it is the more engrossing. Both are great though, and shouldn't be missed!"
3,Suspension of disbelief?,I have generally heard that people felt Angels & Demons was more superior to The Da Vinci Code. Although they are in the same vein - I think Angels & Demons requires alot of suspension of disbelief.
3,Sounds Familiar?,"This book is a pretty good read, but if you have already read ""Tha Da'Vinci Code"" you may not want to bother. This book has the same main character, and the plot is basically the same. In fact, the book sharesthe same frantic pace as in the Da'Vinci Code. I would ratherread Da'Vinci twice, ratherthan spend the money on Angls and Demons."
4,I enjoyed it!,"I purchased this book as a download for my Palm PDA. Never reading any of Dan Brown's books before, I must say I really enjoyed reading his tale. Being a believer in Christ, I wasn't offended (unlike some other readers/reviewers). I took it as a book about human beliefs and the age-old feeling that ""my beliefs are better than yours - your wrong, I'm right!"" type attitude. Very interesting. I enjoyed the plot twists, especially towards the end when you find out a key piece about the Camerlengo - my mouth dropped when it was revealed about his relationship with the Pope. I didn't see that coming!Remember folks, this is fiction - don't take everything as fact. It might actually inspire you to examine your own beliefs and do some research on history yourself.Overall, a really fun, page-turning book that I couldn't put down. I'd recommend it. I look forward to reading Dan Brown's newest book, The Da Vinci Code."
2,"If your a ""Code"" Fan...save your $","The first book by D. Brown I had ever read was The DaVinci Code. I was rivited by the entire novel and couldn't wait to read A & D which is Code's predecessor. I was dissapointed. The character developement was weak and shady at best, the emotions he tried to convey between his hero and heroine felt fake and forced. The fiction portion took on huge leaps of imagination and some of the action portions were unbelievable, unless your a cartoon character. Overall this book wasn't awful, but your best bet is to skip this one and go straight to The Code where he corrected most of what he did wrong in Angels and Demons. Be warned that once you have read a plot line by Brown...the rest of his books follow the same pattern. One book by this author is all you will need or want."
3,Beyond Fantastic -- WAY Beyond,"As you certainly know by now, this is Brown's prequel to the superior Da Vinci Code. Brown's reluctant protagonist, Robert Langdon -- the dumbest smart guy to ever wander off an Ivy League campus -- is introduced and meets his far more competent girlfriend. The casual reader -- if casual reading of Brown is possible -- will be overwhelmed by the incredible scope of this work. It struggles with strange, verbose philosophical and religious preaching toward a wonderfully twisted and surprising ending. It mixes faith with its doppelganger -- madness -- on a huge world stage. In the end, it is so large, and his characters so weird, that it becomes more far-fetched than the wildest science fiction. Only Brown could get away with this and have publishers falling all over themselves to print it rather than laughing it into the round file. I would give this 4 stars if it were just a little less over the top."
4,Just one nagging question,"I read Angels & Demons after the DaVinci Code. A quick read, hard to put down, but definately the same formula. Everyone loves a good conspiracy. But the one nagging question I have is where did the villian have the wherewithal to hire the Assassin."
2,B.C.W,I read all Dan Brown's book. First was really amazed by his talent so I went on and bought the whole set. Then I realized his every book is all the same. They all apply the same writing techniue. A great danger for a brilliant author like himself.
4,"Good, but not as great as The DC","Robert Langdon just doesn't seem as smart in this book. I spent a good chunk of time mentally berating him for making obvious blunders. The worst is when he has an opportunity to kill a villain, and doesn't. It made no sense. There are definitely some pieces of the plot that are just not believable.That being said, this is still a good book. The plot is complex, and I didn't see any of the plot twists coming. I definitely stayed interested until the end. Too bad that Brown's newest book gets mostly 1 star. I'd love to read more books of this caliber."
2,NO WAY.--I'll take the Devil.,"I have read the Da'Vinci Code, and I loved it-Angels & Demons, propaganda, from hype. I picked up Angels and Demons as a package with Billy McCarthy's The Devil of Shakespeare, and I have to say, this Billy (who's a fox) guy has ""a first' that absolutely blows this book away. Angels & Demons is living proof, give it 3 or 10 books to skyrocket the author. The Devil, is nothing like Angels & Demons, but what are we all here for?? Original Voice, CHARACTER, CHARACTERS--not politically motivated brain-wash from someone who finally got it write--finally, on Da'Vinci and never on Angels and Demons. I'm sorry."
2,Don't waste your time,"This is more of a comic book interspersed with art history and symbology. It's the kind of book you read in a few days and then discard or use as a doorstopper, not the kind literature that will last... although, great material for an action-packed Hollywood movie for teenagers."
1,filth,"my friend's trash roommate and her hick boyfriend like this book...enough said. this is a poor man's stephen king or nelson demille novel. most of the book has no plot, and when there is, its stupid and unbelievable. if this book had a soundtrack, it would be the polyphonic spree. you really feel stupid after reading this, for 2 reasons. 1-the plot kills brain cells and 2-you think of the money you wasted down the Stop n Shop book aisle (because thats the only place that will sell this!!!) if you are still interested, just wait for the public access movie version of this terrible piece of ""literature"""
1,ONE MORE NAIL IN THE PARANOIA AGAINST ARABS,"Guess what...the great killer (Hassassin) of this book is a member of the Hashishins, an Arab sect extinct in the Middle Ages during the Crusades.Mr. Brown could not have the creativity to think of a better example of ""evil"" than an arab - not a white, japanese, chinese, etc, it had to be an arab killing people all over Rome.Things like this help to feed the constant paranoia of the West against Arabs and Muslins.Bad book, bad characters, same book as ""The Da Vinci Code"", once you read this last one, you read all, plus you get more influenced by his anti-arabic paranoia."
1,Only if you have too much time,"This is a popcorn book. And just like popcorn movies, you should go in prepared to switch off your brain. If you can ignore the patronising tone that the author takes in the first few chapters, you will be duly rewarded with some truly page-turning edge-of-the-seat chases, and obviously, reading about the Illuminati is downright fascinating. Which should be good enough for a popcorn book, but then again, you have to put up with some of the most inane lines ever printed (a professor of Harvard says to an intellectual equal of his, ""You have actually heard of the Illuminati? I'm impressed."") Come on, even my kid brother's heard about the Illuminati -- we've all watched The Tomb Raider movie, haven't we? And the ending is the most shameless cop-out I've ever come across (won't give it away here), which pretty much overshadows all the good things that came before it. Disappointing."
4,It's fiction - to be read as such,"I like Dan Brown, and Angels & Demons didn't disappoint. Contrary to many fellow reviwers on this site, I can see past the religion and see the book for what it is - entertainment. It isn't a personal vendetta against the Roman Catholic church, nor is it blasphemous or trying to change the history of mankind. It's just an adrenaline-pumping, page-turning suspence novel. A work of fiction."
3,Script or book?,"Like the Da Vinci Code, this plot moves at blinding speed. The pace is impossible, but makes the book a page turner. The plot twists are great and the historical aspect is interesting. This is a good book to save for a long plane trip."
3,Mystery it very good but a bit gruesome murders,Good novel but the murders are described in a very gruesome manner.
5,Angels and Demons,Dan Brown and his suspenseful thriller Angels and Demons give a new meaning to the Action/Adventure Genre. His style of blending mystery and Adventure gives one a reason to hold onto the book and read it more than once. The puzzles and conspiracy theorys are abundant and entertaining throughout the whole book. The twists and turns keep you guessing again and again.
3,"A Thriller, but not good theology","There is no doubt that Angels and Demons is a fast-paced thriller. It's worth the read. I'll let others comment on the science versus science fiction behind antimatter in book. However, one had better not take the ""history"" or ""theology"" as accurate (In deed one need not be ""accurate"" even in an ""historical NOVEL"".) Many of the details of vestiture, language, and theology (e.g. Church's attitude toward ""Creationism"" along with the ""Christian Right"") echo the comment made by one reviewer that the Italian translations were not very accurate. But, again as a thriller, it's great!"
2,"Cardboard characters, interesting information","The idea has a lot going for it - the execution is poor. The only reason I finished it was to read about the sites in Rome and their history. This reminded me of Clive Cussler - male series character, new woman in every book, obligatory relationship. Ian Fleming did it better. Nowadays the females get interesting professions but it's really their appearance and attraction that get the attention. There isn't any character development that is shown rather than told.The villain became obvious fairly early on. The last couple chapters involve a twist that seems written in according to formula.I had high hopes for this. The author obviously has a lot of knowledge and good plot ideas. The writing, however, is so flawed that it robbed the book of any charm."
3,Better than Da Vinci,"This book has over a thousand reviewers, so I would amagine everything has been said. I liked it better than the even more popular Da Vinci Code--but they're both good reads."
4,Dan Brown delivers again,A few good twists that differ from the movie...a great thriller which provides a lot of entertainment value.
4,Exciting. Needs editing.,"I agree with some of the reviewers of Dan Brown's other books. He should fire his editor. Brown gets a lot of basic information wrong in the book. For instance, he doesn't know the difference between a ""church"", a ""cathedral"" and a ""basilica"". They're all ""cathedrals"" to him. For a story that deals with intricacies of the Catholic Church his lack of understanding of some elementary terminology is amazing. He needs a better editor.The first 80 pages or so were slow going and I almost gave up. But after that the story really takes off and carries the reader along a wild and exciting journey similar to that in THE DA VINCI CODE. A thriller but made less believable by glaring lack of understanding of the author. He needs a better editor."
1,"""It is wiser to find out than to suppose.""","I really wanted to give this book a chance. But, over and over, I would just get into it and then Brown would make a stupid mistake. Causing me to become frustrated and a bit offended by his lack of respect for his readers intelligence. I am not Catholic but I do know a great deal about the inner workings of the Catholic Church. After reading this I can now see why the church is so angry with him. He simply has things wrong. Most of the ""facts"" he states about papal succession are wrong. As well as several of the things the former pope was supposed to have said and done no pope would ever say or do. If he had he would never have been elected pope. I am also not foreign to scientific understanding and, there as well, are some very basic mistakes. The reviewer before me has pointed out language mistranslations so I feel that I can safely say that Dan Brown should heed the advice of Mark Twain, ""It is wiser to find out than to suppose."""
2,A flash in the pan ...,"If you want a 4-star read, tear out the first 70 pages, the last 20, and suspend all disbelief that a Harvard professor can solve an ancient mystery created by the greatest minds of an age in six hours, instead of six decades with the assistance of guide dogs and cavorting clowns holding signs that say 'Clue Here!'The story was pretty good, but the author's political drivel and distortions of history really drag it down. I never actually read the last few pages; the ending was that lame. This paperback is going straight into the trash bin."
1,Silly Book #1,"Okay, I admit it, I'm the last person in the Northern Hemisphere - except for a pocket of Eskimos - who has not read ""The Da Vinci Code"". But, wanting to make sure that I had the code framed correctly I had to read this book first - the prequel.All I can say is that this is a silly little - although 500+ pages - book. It is not Trevanian, Follett, nor even Clancy at his worst. It is barely a book for a long airplane flight nor a bout with allergies. Why did I read the whole thing? Why do we watch baseball????"
1,Why this book sold in some countries - and not in others,"I am currently writing a thesis on sociological behaviour and statistical analysis on human intelligence among and between OECD countries. This book, branded by some European opinion leaders as the ""most pathetic and stupid book of the decade"", still became a million-plus seller in some (so-called) developed countries, though this phenomenon seemed to be isolated geographically. My thesis will try to unveil if this phenomenon was mainly due to economic behaviour, such as marketing or distribution. Or if it is explained by the somehow globally accepted view that some (so-called) developed countries have intellectually challenged populations."
2,all plot,What a disappointment. I forced myself to finish this book. This book is entirely plot driven and the writing style is not more advanced than a young adult book. I agree it's sometimes fun to read a good story rather than read a novel that's all symbolic and philosophical; but if you want a good storyteller read any Barbara Kingsolver book (particularly The Poisonwood Bible) or Vikram Seth's 'A Suitable Boy' (not An Equal Music). These people tell stories much bettern than Dan Brown.
3,Less than Davinci Code,Not as well written as next book. At least Catholic Church is reflected in some positive ways in this one.
4,"I don't usually read prequels, but this one caught me!","After I read The Da Vinci Code, I knew I needed to read Angels & Demons. I don't usually read ""prequels,"" but the craftsmanship in the later book was good enough that I gave the earlier book a whirl. I was, in a word, impressed.If you like suspense, especially with a backdrop of religion and conspiracy, this is a must-read. Illuminati infiltrating the Vatican? Vows of revenge resurrected after hundreds of years? You bet!Robert Langdon's character is not quite as well developed as in The Da Vinci Code, but he's rounded enough to be believable. You can see the beginnings of him as sort of a ""philosopher's Indiana Jones."""
1,Pure schlock,Repeat of DaVinci Code with slightly different premise. Horrible writing and shallow characters. Can't believe this got 4 stars! Obviously written for the $.
5,Loved it!,"This was really a LOT OF FUN; Very fast-moving, a great travelogue; very clever, interesting bits about evolution and the big bang ... I truly enjoyed it a great deal ... At the end some of the plot twists were beyond rediculous but that didn't bother me much at all because there were other great plot twists that were unexpected and a lot fun! Dive in! This is a good one!"
5,Copacetic Book,"I recommend reading William Bramley's ""The Gods of Eden"" before taking on this book. It gives you some background for a lot of the things that pop up in there. The general themes of the books have nothing to do with each other, but the information is related."
5,Awesome!,Ok this had to be the best book I've read recently and I cant wait to see the movie! Must read for everyone!
1,purchased book from the emerald book shop thru Amazon.com,"The book never came. I do not recommend buying from this seller. Amazon.com did make their A to Z guarantee good ( I guess,because I do not have my credit card statement yet). I only know what they told me electronically. I have dealt with Amazon before and have had good results, so this seller is not to be bouht from. As far as I'm concerned, Amazon is a good company, but I will review the reviews a little closer from now on."
2,Poorly researched and poorly written,"I never understood what all of the excitement was about ""The Da Vinci Code"" and this is just slightly better written, in my opinion. Da Vinci was essentially a really bad detective story with historical speculation cribbed directly from other sources inserted throughout.""Angels & Demons"" works slightly better as a thriller, but the dialogue is cheesy and I find it hard to believe that the female lead would fall in love with Robert Langdon so quickly and especially so quickly after the murder of her father.Also, how poor does your research have to be if you don't know that cell phones done have dial-tone? This is mentioned at least a dozen times. Dan Brown didn't own a cell phone in 2000? I find that hard to believe. Just lazy writing. Could have been changed to checking for a signal and wouldn't have seemed like just poor and lazy research."
1,Liked it even less than DiVinci,Dan Brown has now joined my James Patterson/John Grisham/Dean Koontz Club -- so much potential -- so much disappointment!The only thing I can think of that would be more painful than trying to finish the book (only read about two-thirds of it then skipped to the end) would be trying to watch Tom Hanks play out the role with his one serious expression and freaky hair . . . again! (typed the way Forest Gump talks)
2,Disappointing,"Pehaps one should expect it to be difficult to follow up the DaVinci Code, but surely Brown could have done something better than this. The plot is beyond silly, the characters are poorly developed, and the action is unintereseting.It gets a second star only because the settings and research into them are, assuming Brown has been accurate, quite interesting. But after the first hundred pages I began skimming liberally, and don't feel that I missed much, if anything."
2,An exceptionally farfetched page-turner,"Anti-matter, The Vatican, The Illuminati, Galileo...did I miss anything? Dan Brown introduces his symbologist hero, Robert Langdon, in this totally ridiculous thriller. Filled with enough red herrings to fill the hold of a ship, yet failing to disguise the fairly obvious climax, Brown does create an outrageous page-turner. By piling on one crazy idea after another, Brown is able to keep the reader interested by keeping his prose fats moving and compelling, not letting the reader sit back and say, ""Oh Please!"" until the end.I read this one before taking on the best selling sequel and now I find I'm in no particular hurry to read that one. I will say this you won't be bored by this one, although you may find your mouth wide open from disbelief by the time it's over."
1,Mediocre read,"Written in the same style and structure of the Davinci code, it's boring and a bit predictable. The story too sensationalized and the you can figure out who the villain is before the ""twist."""
2,"Same characters, plot, everything","Like many others, I read ""The Da Vinci Code"" and wanted to read ""Angels and Demons."" They are the exact same in character, plot, setting and style. We still have a naked man murdered at the beginning. The author makes references to penises and phallic symbols throughout the book, just like ""Da Vinci Code"". The setting is still present-day Europe and another tourist attraction in Italy, instead of France. There is the beautiful young woman related to the murdered man. The same Robert Langdon. Another crippled man as a minor character. A search to find who killed the man and the use of symbolism to decipher a ""code"" or ""map."" Do not waste your money. Just read ""The Da Vinci Code"" again."
1,Dumb Dumb Dumb,"I originally bought ""The DaVinci Code"" Bool on CD for a long car trip and found it enjoyable, so I bought this one for the drive back. In the first 10 minutes I realized just how mediocre an author Dan Brown is. Both stories sound like they were written using the same outline. Maybe it was because I listened to it first, but ""Code"" came across as much more enjoyable, and without a lot of the hokey elements that plague ""A&D"". It's a shame too, because this story could have been really good with a little effort. Langdon could be an interesting character, but Brown doesn't develope him at all. He comes across like a one dimensional ""Jack Ryan meets Indiana Jones"". The end result is that this book is so bad, it not only ruins itself, but also ruins ""The DaVinci Code"" along with it. If you enjoyed ""Code"", do NOT buy this book."
1,"Oh my god, this is so bad","Every once in a while, you read a book that just floors you with its low quality. This is one of those.Let me see if I can summarize it for you.A sexy, single, well-liked-by-his-students Harvard professor with a swimmer's bod (he swims fifty laps a day) hooks up with the smartest woman on earth (she is also very sexy)to thwart a ""Hassassin"" who was hired by the illuminati to blow up the Pope with anti-matter.Yep, that's it."
1,"Even worse than the DaVinci Code ... yes, really","Complicated, unlikely plot, silly dialog, unrealistic characters.It's not all bad, though. There is one upside to Angels and Demons. It's the unintended hilarity of the close-to-final scene where our hero lands in the Tiber after a spectacular leap from a helicopter, and the villain parachutes to the top of St Peters. You don't see writing and plotting like that very often."
3,"Don't buy the new, borrow it from library.","Boring, yet some are intriguing details and dialogues.Rober Longdon was stupid enought to figure out the clue, albeit he can not save any one of the cardinal."
4,Well deserved,I love the way Dan Brown mixes fiction with history. He is a real master in creating plots and suspense. Angels & Demons is definitely a great thriller. One of the best I have ever read.I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did. I'm almost finished with The Da Vinci Code.Frank
5,A Thought Provoking Pageturner,"This is the first Dan Brown novel I have read. It was recommended I read this before reading The DaVinci Code. Having been raised a catholic all my life, many aspects of this novel interested me. I love adventure novels and this was a real page turner. The author's style of writing bounces very smoothly from one aspect of the story to another. The author gives you some information, but strings you along and makes you want to continue reading to find out just what will happen next. It is a really neat mix of both science, religion and on the edge of your seat adventure."
3,Depends on what you're looking for......,"If you're looking for a historical novel based on historically acurate and correct facts, this is not it.If you're looking for character depth and want to stay away from stereotypes, stay away from this book.However, if you're looking for a book that's fun to read, with a most creative and ambitious plot, you've found it.From this perspective, I must add it's too much like the Code but nontheless entertaining."
2,From Yaa baa daa baa doo to Scooby Doo!!,"It stars like the Flinstones on CERN (Switzerland), after that the story goes to Rome now is Harry Potter down there and at the end Scooby solves the problem. The novel goes in almost 600 pages, I would like to know this before reading, because it's NOT Recomended!! Excellent Marketing!"
3,Rough draft for the Da Vinci Code,"I'd have given it 4 stars if I hadn't read the Da Vinci Code first. This is just a rough draft, with all the same themes. Brown is superb at pulling together bits and pieces from different disciplines. Some of the bits and pieces here are scientific, though, and they are very shaky. I just hope his art history and religious symbolism are better. The most amusing is his assumption that readers will never have heard of the CERN, which is a bit like supposing they've never heard of NASA. Oh well, Dan, if you read this, it was a good read, and I'm just jealous as hell of your money. I'm sure you want to rid the world of jealousy... a word to the wise...."
2,Conflicted,"How do I say this? Extremely well written book. Author is amazing. BUT, I cannot give 5 stars to a book that is so polar-opposite to all I believe, no, all that I know to be true regarding God and faith. Left me with a bad taste.Would like to read a book by author that is not based on religion."
4,another great novel by dan brown,"Dan brown continues to amaze me. As for the doctor person that commented that it was inacurate: that is why it is called fiction. I very much enjoyed the plot twists, even thought the timing of it all may have been inacurate. Still, if you are a fan of Dan brown's other books, this one won't let you down."
4,Good Fast Paced Read,"I thought this book was very good. I like the Da Vinci Code marginally better, but that could be just because I read that first. Overall, I thought both books were very interesting."
3,Not as good as Divinci Code,"This was not a page turner the way Divinci code was for me. The characters could have be more developed, and the pacing was off at times. Not crazy about the sequence of events at the end."
2,There goes a couple hours of my life,"Dan Brown is not your author if you are looking for a thought-provoking book, or even a credible plot. This book can be a fun read, but it is (thankfully) forgettable.Readers can enjoy the scenery--although several of the scenes were unnecessarily graphic--just don't look too closely at the details!Even with plot holes and a high gross-out factor, I was enjoying the book right up until the end. The plot twist and plot complication completely lost me. I had a hard time believing the characters' motivations at that point.This book is not the best or most entertaining Dan Brown book available."
3,"Okay, average paperback thriller","This book is good beach reading. It moves pretty fast and the descriptions are vivid. BUT, the culprit is revealed very early with an aside that is the movie equivalent to a suspect looking directly into a camera after the others have left the room. Too obvious.The story should have ended much earlier than it did. It would have made for a tighter novel. Instead it wound up with some very fantastic and insipid plot twists that kind ruined the first 400 pages. They seemed like afterthoughts, as if he had a 500 word minimum and had to tack on more stuff at the end. That was disappointing.I have not read the Da Vinci Code yet, but I hope its written better than this, for the sake of all the people who say its a great book.Good for beach reading, but not great, or even good, literature."
2,Predicatable and condescending,"I read this after hearing great things about it and ""The Da Vinci Code"". The first 200 pages or so are admittedly gripping, but shortly after, I had the rest of the story figured out and spent the remaining 300 or so pages hoping, futilely, to be surprised. Brown doesn't seem to trust the reader to put any pieces together for themselves -- from translations for every minute bit of Italian that is spoken, to a map in the front of the book that allows the reader to figure out where everything will be taking place hundreds of pages before they happen, the author holds your hand through every step, hoping you're keeping up when in fact you're way ahead of him."
3,Quite good....but the end!!!,"At the beginning I really liked Dan Brown's novel. It has an interesting story, an historical background, it comes up with some nice facts and so on....As the end, however, Dan Brown seemed to have lost ideas. The strangest coincidences happen and the whole story gets more and more confusing. The highlight of dumbness is when Robert Langdon jumps out of a helicopter and doesn't get injured at all (don't try this at home...you'll definitely die).Nevertheless there are worse books on the market and if you have some time and want to be entertained without using too much of your brains, have a look at ""Angels and Demons""."
2,Flawed Research?,"This was the usual thrill-a-minute book. Interesting concepts, lots of twists, turns and surprises. The author purports to be an authority on a number of subjects from symbology to theology. However, I did notice two mistakes. Brown writes that only Cardinals can be elected Pope; acutally any male (and, please God, someday any woman)can be elected Pope without even the need to be an ordained priest. Secondly, Brown defines ""Devil's Advocate"" as the cleric who vets any potential Pope. The ""Devil's Advocate"" is the cleric assigned to challenge the canonization of a person being considered for sainthood. These two points could have been easily researched --so how valid is the remainder of his research? I'm reading the ""DaVinci Code"" now, so I'll see how accurate he is."
3,Deja vu,"Enjoyed the history and religion which are woven into the story very much. But I liked it better the first time when it was called the Divinci Code. (Yes, I know this one was written before, but I read it later.) The exact, and I mean the exact, same formula."
4,Good Book,This book was much better than the Da Vinci Code. Dan Brown is a quite interesting author and this book is very interesting. I recommend this book to people who thought the da vinci code was ok
3,Decent novel,"Like many others, I read Angels & Demons after thoroughly enjoying The DaVinci Code.While I enjoyed Angels & Demons, it was a little predictable after having read The DaVicni Code. It's basically the same structure--starts out with a murder, Langdon hooks up with a family member of dead person, they set out to find out what happened.If you really liked The DaVinci Code, you'll probably enjoy this book...it's a fast read anyway, so you won't be spending weeks reading it or anything. It's just not as good as The DaVinci Code, and it is difficult to separate the two and judge this one as a completely different book without taking both into consideration."
3,Suspend your Disbelief,"I read the Da Vinci Code before reading this one and find the same conspiracy theories throughout both. Not that that's a bad thing. But you really have to take the story with a grain of salt. Make that several grains! Being raised Catholic, I found the ceremonies etc. very familiar, but the plot twists are pretty hard to swallow. That helicopter scene is way beyond credible! Devout Catholics will be offended by the book, but to give the guy credit, he tells a good story. Liked the main male character, but getting really tired of authors who seem determined to make their lead females appear strong and independent by making them bitchy and rude."
4,Fascinating and suspenseful read,"If you are going to (or have) read The Da Vinci Code, you have to read this book as well. Both books follow the same style in how the plot unfolds and how the reader is drawn into the dramatic conclusion. And, while the style and form are not particularly original, the author's use of symbolism and religious factoids make it far more interesting than other books of the same genre. It's definitely a can't-put-down-page-turner. So, be sure to find yourself some ""free time"" before you dive in."
3,"Loved The DaVinci Code - this one, not so much.","After reading The DaVinci Code, one of the most entertaining, historically interesting and cleverly written books I've ever read, I was eager to read Angels and Demons. Angels and Demons is a prequel to The DaVinci Code however, the main character is much less likable in Angles and Demons and the writing/story line is less sophisticated. This book is entertaining and interesting in the same vein as The DaVinci Code, but I personally found it to be way too violent and had to put it down about half way through it (could not bear to read about another detailed, gruesome killing!)."
2,Expected more,The book was 200 pages longer than the story required. The beginning is extremely slow and I almost gave up on the book. There were some nice unexpected plot twists but they were too little too late.
1,Pathetic,"There are few best sellers that make me wince, but this is certainly one of them. Beyond the stilted dialogue, the cliches, and the hit-you-over-the-head-with-a-brick endless foreshadowing, this was an embarassing mess from start to finish.It actually scares me that otherwise intelligent people found this worthy of such praise. Admittedly, this isn't my genre, but this is pure schlock."
5,A novel that work on so many levels.,"The well-known Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon has involved himself in a conspiracy to overthrow the establishment of Catholic Church in the center of Vatican....Angels and Demons is not just one type of novel. It is not just a scholarly novel dealing with the conflict between the catholic church and the science. It is also a suspense novel that gives the readers thrills and excitement as the story goes on. The author, Dan Brown, makes the novel seem real with so many details ranging from scientific theories to religious ideas. It is a great book to read."
3,meh,"I feel like reading the very first rough draft of The Da Vinci Code. The two books have very similar formulas. Take Robert Langdon, the great symbologist, and bring him to a young female whose relative is murdered by a ""secret brotherhood"".This book is definitely less enjoyable than DVC. It is less organized and less well-written. Also, it may be a matter of preference in spelling, but isn't Raphael's last name ""Sanzio"" and not ""Santi""? Moreover, this book is more offensive because the character who represents the religious ones turns out to be delusional and a little insane. By portraying him so, Brown is basically saying religious people who think they really hear God are nothing but deluded/insane like the said-character.The only thing I enjoyed from this book is the hilarous quote: ""Carlo, your parents were both virgins."""
5,Could not put it down,"In the same way I go through James Patterson's Alex Cross series,unable to stop and put the book down, so it was with Angels & Demons. The story is a great thriller and has a new hero Robert Langdon.What I like most about the story was it's sophistication, fast pace and great value in exposing audience to art history.Everyone I turned on to this book loves it!"
2,Angels & Demons,"My friend who lives in Rome suggested this book. I generally avoid Dan Brown, and sort of wish I had avoided this book. His research was great, if you can believe all of his information, and the well described locations all over Rome were marvelous, but ........ Two, not one but TWO, men fall out of a helicopter very high above Rome and land unharmed? Many other plot devises were quite difficult to digest. Plus, Brown seems to have a personal vendetta for the Catholic Church. God certainly knows a lot of evil has been done in the name of religion and the church probsably leads the pack, but Brown's problem seems rather personal. Maybe he was abused by a priest?"
4,Great read!,"I really enjoy Dan Brown's books - Angels and Demons kept me turning the page with details that keep you thinking and looking ahead and a few twists and turns that appeared unexpectedly. A good, easy and uncomplicated read!"
2,"Badly written, badly edited - why is this guy so popular?","Haven't read the Code, thought I'd start with Angels. What a disappointment! The characters are stereotypical; the only significant female character is a yogini physicist scuba diver whose role deteriorates from central character to simple object of desire. The plot is full of implausible details, and the ending is a multiple-twist confusion worthy of a Harry Potter novel. The errors are annoying."
3,More of the same,"I won't bother to rehash the plot of this book because if you read the Da Vinci Code, you basically know the plot of this book. I was disappointed with this book because the plot is so similar to DVC."
5,"Great, non-stop plot","I read Angels and Demons after I read the Da Vinci Code. I had been told that this was the better of the two books and I have to concur. It has a wonderful plot; complex enough to keep you guessing but not so complex that you can't put it all together at the end. Some of the annoying aspects of Brown's writing style were far less evident in Angels and Demons than were in the Da Vinci Code (e.g., things like ""What he saw next he couldn't have imagined in his wildest dreams . . ."")FYI -- I listened unabridged audio production of Angels and Demons. While it was sometimes difficult to distinguish between the characters, it was, for the most part, a good narration."
5,PERFECT!,"Amazing how all the hype surrounded The Da Vinci Code when Dan Brown's preceeding book, Angels and Daemons, was even better!! Hopefully people will explore beyond the one with all the hype and discover that Dan Brown is an incredible writer many times over."
4,Quick and interesting,"A&D is a quick read that grabs you at the beginning and largely holds on for almost 600 pages. For all the pseudo-intellectuals posturing that the book is rife with mistakes - get over it, its fiction (and what are you doing reading best sellers anyway - isn't there some dusty text book in need of your attention?)Yes the plot is over the top. Yes the events could not happen in the allotted time. Yes there are predictable elements. And yes there are probably even mistakes (although I wasn't as aghast about the misuse of a latin word as others). All in all, its still pretty fun and compelling and I'll even admit to having learned a couple of things.I rate as 4 stars b/c I still think the DVC is better. But I'd gladly read this over most other works of fiction."
2,Pretty bad. . .,"Several reviewers have already mentioned the factual, historical, scientific and translation errors, so there's no point in going over those in detail. The most offensive part of the book to me was the poor writing and plotting. Brown's foreshadowing served absolutely no purpose; neither did his editorializing. The implausibility of the characters' breadth of knowledge is laughable. On the positive side, though, one has to admire Brown's ability to get the reader to turn pages; despite the poor writing, the book is a Patterson-like read.Although I can't fault the author for the blurbs printed on the cover, I have to wonder if those reviewers who referred to the book as ""smart"" and ""high IQ"" are the types who wear round, plain-glass specs because they think it makes them ""look"" intelligent?I hope that the tremendously popular _DaVinci Code_ (which I have not read) demonstrates a maturation of the author and his talents."
1,Get the Physics Right Next Time,"A novel about reconciling science and religion would be worthwhile, but you need to get the science right or at least plausible. I ran into a dozen ""Give me a breaks"" before I put this book down in disgust. Some of these are that gravity is 30% less at 60,000 feet (it's 0.3% less), using tuna to disprove the theory of relativity, and making antimatter proves God's existence (physicists have know about antimatter since the 1920s and first made antiprotons in the 1950s). Despite thanking CERN and Brookhaven in the acknowledgements, it's clear that Mr. Brown didn't have a physicist or even a high school physics student proofread this book."
2,Thank Goodness It Was A Fast Read,I really wanted to like this book. At first I cherished carrying around the thick 569 page hardcover enjoying the ease of which Dan Brown's writing can be read. But something happened midway through the story. The story that began with so much scientific intelligence and religious tradition suddenly took on a MacGyver-like air. The book started to truly test my intelligence and patience. As I pushed toward the story's conclusion I realized the best of it had already come and gone some time ago. Anti-climatic might be a word to describe this story. Or maybe I'm just out of touch with the new Video Game style of story plots in books and movies.
2,A Big YAWN !,"I'm sorry, but this book is 10 percent story and 90 percent encyclopedia. If you removed all of the tedious regurgitation of information, you'd be left with about twenty pages of plot in a very long book.I don't get the appeal, and would be more likely to go for this if it were Brown writing non-fiction travel/historical books.Page after page after page of facts. Ugh. Even if some of the facts are interesting (and this certainly is the case)- they should have been force-fed to us in smaller doses, in abbreviated versions, so that readers could remember what the actual plot was supposed to be."
3,OK but not great,"This book is OK. I read it last summer, and that is what I consider it to be- a ""summer reading"" book. The story is interesting and the action is even quite compelling in parts of the book, but...the writing is just not that great. This is definitely NOT ""The Great American Novel"". So, if you are looking for something decent to read for some entertainment and to pass some time, then this book may fill your needs. If you are looking for a book of real literary value, then look elsewhere."
3,Page missing,There were a couple of pages missing. But luckily nothing thrilling or of importance happens in those pages. Otherwise the book was in the condition as described. Delivery was as promised.
1,Go see a Hollywood Action Thriller - This book is Similar,"One of the dumbest books I ever read! The history of Catholicism, the Vatican, Rome and the Illuminati and ambigrams were all interesting, but once the action starts, this book is like watching a dumb Hollywood action movie where the bad guy (like Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction) is left for dead by the heroes and then miraculously arises for one last blow while the heroes rest. The book and ending is convoluted with several different endings and the story is too fantastic for an intelligent mind to ponder the reality of it. When the hero jumps from a Helicopter miles up and lives because he used a canopy to break his fall, I knew I made a mistake in reading this. The end of the story goes on forever and the writing is simplistic. This author is a hack making millions of dollars by exploiting the mindless! Do yourself a favor and shy away from this book. Like they say, ""candy will rot your teeth."" Well, this book will rot your brain!"
5,Better than the DaVinci Code,Perhaps it is because I read it first....but I found this book much more intruiging than the DaVinci Code. It is a fantastic suspense thriller that captures you in the first few pages. This was a book that I could not put down. I was so engaged that I missed my subway stop!!!!
5,BEST EVER!,"Being an avid reader of mysteries, thrillers, and fiction, I can honestly say that Angels and Demons is the best non-literary book I have ever read. I read the The Di Vinci Code and enjoyed it. So, I got Brown's first book and I could not put it down. I found it to be to a total page-turner. I learned alot about the history of the Vatican, the Illuminati, Bernini, and Rome. After finishing the book, I am eager to learn more about the above subjects.Brown's hero, Robert Langdon, is very likable and a good person to center a book around. If you want a fantastic read, want a ""got to finish it, can't wait for the next chapter"" buy this book. Scale of 1-10, a 20!"
5,Better than DaVinci Code!,"I loved this book. I read DaVinci Code and thought is was a great book, but A&D was actually better. (Which is hard to accomplish) It really kept me on the edge of my seat. I would totally recommend this book. I can't wait for Dan Browns next book to come out. He is a wonderful author."
3,Just okay,"I'm not a brainy-iac, so I don't know whether the wrong latin word was used or whether historical facts were misrepresented. All I know was this was one hard pill to swallow. First of all, for the first third of the book I didn't understand why the hero in this story was contacted in the first place. And I simply didn't believe the whole premise of anti-matter. It made no sense of how it was created or stored. I couldn't get past that. How do you do that...and how do you store it? Okay,let's get to the Mach 15 plane. Why does this man have this? Plus, the hero failed to save any of the cardinals. Indiana Jones--this man is not. For a smart man he doesn't a lot of dumb things. Plus, these people can run across towns in matter of seconds..maybe a minute. But the subject matter is different...which is the whole trick to Mr. Brown's popularity. And for that my hat goes off to him for that."
1,Review,I was very disappointed with this seller. They never even shipped the book. When I contacted them 2x no one ever got back to me. Thank goodness Amazon took care of my claim right away & I received my credit.
1,boring,"I was so disappointed in this book every one told me that it was exciting and very suspenseful. But, the first two thirds of the book I thought was very boring. I kept waiting for things to pick up and get going but, I kept falling asleep. I loved it once the cardinals were taken but, I really didn't care for it at all. Too much science for me."
5,A fabulous read,"Thoroughly enjoyed this book and the Da Vinci Code. Both excellent, intellectual novels. I couldn't put them down!"
3,thought provoking,"I enjoyed the action in this story, although some thingswere a bit far fetched. The ideas behind the story wereinteresting and in my opinion - thought provoking.The one thing that spoilt it - in a bad way - was the utterllyterrible Italian used. Obviously quite some research went intothe story and it is a pity that more care wasn't taken to ensureall the Italian used was coorect."
1,Straight-up Garbage,"This book sucks. Read it again. Priests running through catacombs, jumping out of helicopters, last second parachuting, time bombs, anti-matter for cripes sakes! Is this a comic book or a hallucinatory day dream? It is not bad like your cousin wrote it but it's still bad. C'mon!"
2,The Same Old.......,"The book is interesting and will hold your attention. But...It's exactly the same as the Da Vinci Code. If you've read one, no reason to read the other."
3,Angels and Demons,"After reading the Da Vinci Code this was a little disappointing for me. The story structure was just about the the same, dead body with a message, clever professor and an intellectual damsel, difficult authority figures, race against time etc..The science was not well researched, some rather dubious anti-matter claims and rather silly relationship between anti-matter, free, clean energy, the big bang and religeon. It ignores the enormous energy cost, pollution and poor efficiency involved in creating the anti-matter in the first place. Anti-matter has been known about since 1928 when it was postulated by Dirac and confirmed by experiment in 1932, with the discovery of the positron. The idea supports E=mc2, that is all. It does not keep the Pope awake at night, I am sure. After reading the Da Vinci code I expected a better researched book. Still it was a good read and once I forgot the science flaws I got into the story and enjoyed it."
2,Genuinely terrible,"Clumsy writing, no real characterizations, and a plot that is nothing but unmotivated turns and twists. Skip it, skip it, skip it."
3,Ever try to talk on a cell phone while your weaving through traffic?,"Of course he said he couldn't get a dial tone instead of signal, and what do you call it when you pick-up the old Motorola (not digital) and discover that infernal beep,beep,beep,beep,.....Was somebody jamming that signal?.......ABLE DANGER!"
1,Not his unsual stuff,I did not enjoy this like I have most of his earlier works. The plot wasnt all that gripping.
3,"Good suspense, a tad streched in the end","Yes, it really is Da Vinci code in its previous incarnatation.Angels and Demons, from start to finish is a true Dan Brown's religious thriller. Full of religious symbols, puzzles, shocking moments, a good suspense, secret societies and historical figures. Da Vinci code was about Leonardo Da Vinci's works, this one's about Bernini's and Galileo's. You can draw parallels between these two books at each and every step.I was really dazzled by Brown's Da Vinci Code and this book comes really close in keeping you riveted to the plot too. If you have already read Da Vinci Code, like most of us here, go for this book only if you do not mind repeatitions. No doubt there are far better thrillers written which never came close in popularity. This book is not a great read for language purists and the end seems a bit stretched.However, to be fair, the book is exciting. Dan Brown knows how to build suspense and keep the reader glued."
1,Written for the fourth grade,"Okay, I want to say that I started reading this book because a friend highly recommended it to me. While the overall synopsis of the plot has merit and could no doubt be turned into a great story - the writing is absolutely abysmal.The characters are shallow, and the reader is dragged through each paragraph like a slack-jawed mouth breather with no sense of deductive reasoning to draw on. Despite the nice plot, I could not finish the book.Save your money."
1,Awfully written book....,I actually gave up on this book because of annoying idiosy of the plot and complete inability of the writer to express his ideas clearly. Da Vinci Code is equally inept...
3,Prepare to suspend belief,"As another person who read The Da Vinci Code first, I certainly see a formula style in Brown's writing. The thriller aspect makes exciting reading and I enjoyed the interspersed history lessons (and they did feel as if that is what they were!) Robert Langdon, the main character, is supposedly an unassuming Havard professor, but I doubt that even Superman possesses his amazing powers to thwart death."
4,Then suddenly it all made sense...,"This book is all set within a 24-hour period. It's got mysticism and cults, action, violence, romance, discussion on religion and science and pretty much all the things you need for a quick, addictive little book that will obsess your mind. I got a little irritated by the fact that the main character has repeated moments of clarity where SUDDENLY it all makes sense and a section of plot is explained through his revelations, but then again, the plot is pretty contrived to begin with. I found I enjoyed it none-the-less."
2,Too over the top,"Much preferred Da Vinci Code. The scenarios in A&D are outrageous and the motives, reactions and responses of characters are too often unrealistic. The last few chapters are laughable with unsatisfying twists, coming off as twists for the sake of twists. Made-for-TV thriller material here with awkward commentary on the so-called spiritual state of the modern world. Da Vinci Code is somewhat better researched, a better paced thriller and its weaknesses are generally forgivable."
4,Prequill,I liked this book as well or better than the more famous sequells. It's a good read and I understand that you can go an a tour of the sites if you visit Rome.
3,It's no DaVinci Code,"I tried so hard to read this book, but kept getting bogged down in the details. Finally, I was able to finish it by listening to it on tape, but I was disappointed. This has a good story, excellent plot twists and turns, but it was difficult to read due to all of the physics lessons and other details. I couldn't put down the DaVinci code, that was not the case with this book."
4,angels and demons,"this second book of Dan Brown is a joy to read. For readers interested inhistorical places such as Rome, this book points out several new facts unknown to most of the readers, although many of them have been to Rome before.The story is thrilling and keeps the reader interested, wanting to know what happens next. Dan Brown's explanation about the Illuminati is well documented and tickles of the curiosity of the reader. The illustrations in this book are beautiful done and helps the reader to understand even more the setting of this compelling novel.Due to use of larger typing, it's easier to read (for instance in bed with less light)."
2,Same thing over and over,"Dan Brown just seems to write the same book over-and-over. This book is so similar to ""The Da Vinci Code"" that it's just deja vu reading it."
3,Mixed Bag,"No question that it is a good exciting read. But, you have to ignore or read over the heavy religious sentiment and ""miracles"" to enjoy this book, which tend to drag it down. Disappointing after having read ""Deception Point"" by the same author, which is an outstanding book."
2,...yawn...,"As a conspirologist, I was intrigued. Sadly, this was a by-the-numbers thriller. Nothing new. I'll stick with the truth."
3,Nonsense but a lot of fun,"There has been an awful lot of hype about Dan Browns books, so much so that a sort of cult is emerging. On the other side of the coin is the detractors who nit pick on his penchant for exageration and inaccuracy. They are fiction for gods sake!People are taking his stuff way too seriously, both positive and negative, and should just see them for what they are - fast paced, formula driven, far fetched, silly fun.Well worth a read - just like McDonalds is worth eating. ie about twice a year.."
4,The Horror and The Hope,"This book was an excellent read; suspenseful and intelligent. The story itself was over the top, but somehow Brown manages to maintain the readers suspension of disbelief.I have no doubt that a great deal of his success stems from the exhaustive research that he put into the book. He deals with little known information about CERN (Conseil Europeen pour la Recherche Nucleaire), anti-matter, the Vatican and the Illuminati without dropping the ball. Aside from actual plot, this novel is a fascinating read because of all the intriguing factual information you are given through the narrative.Brown also manages to keep you guessing. Though I figured out certain elements long before they were revealed, there were still surprises waiting for me at the end.I highly recommend this one and I will no doubt be picking up his new release, The Da Vinci Code, in the future."
2,Such an assortment of misinformation...,"I work at CERN. This book's relationship to fact or anything like it is minimal at best. What a pile of garbage - the only thing you can safely credit is that CERN in near Geneva and that there is a huge accelerator (being built) there.Everything else is hokey baloney. Everything. Which means you really can't take anything he says seriously. At all.That in addition to being a Mad Libs/Xerox rehash of DaVinci Code. Which also wasn't terribly burdened with facts.The philosophy was laughable and... sophomoric. What can I say?That being said - when I wasn't groaning out loud, or laughing, it was an OK thrill ride. It's not worth all the fuss, though - this isn't in the same league even as Grisham or Clancy."
2,Brown doesn't know much about Catholicism,"I hope I'm not giving away anything here, but near the end we're told that a certain two parties had a child together through artificial insemination, and therefore ""commited no sin"" under Catholic doctrine. Brown needs to check his catechism again. The fact that this error is critical to the book's ending calls into question the reliability of any of Brown's statements about the church and church law."
5,Amazing.,"Simply put: amazing. Will make you think and beg for more. This is definetely a do not put down book. In fact this book is a thriller, historical fiction, romance, factual history, and detective novel. I reccomend it be read before the Da Vinci code (which is good on it's own). Both books are great and controversial. You will learn a lot (some of it is a bit stretched but you can research it on your own) and will go through a lot of emotions, depending on which ""side"" you're on in both books."
2,Angels not on Brown's side,"As a loyal reader of Brown before the popularity of The Da Vinci Code skyrocketed last summer, I can honestly say that this is my least favorite of his novels. While the premise of the story is interesting and the descriptions of Rome fantastic, the ending of this thriller is just too unbelievable for my tastes. It left me skeptical of Brown's abilities as a writer and made me wonder how he was able to write such a fantastic story of The Da Vinci Code after this bungle called Angels & Demons.Save some time and do yourself a favor: skip this Brown novel and head straight to The Da Vinci Code."
2,Not Even Good Enough For Vacation Reading,"Based on all the great reviews, and the comparisons to ""The Eight"" by Katherine Neville, I brought this book along on my last vacation. While it is a page-turner, the writing is poor, and the plot borders on the ridiculous. I completely second the other review that mentions the preposterous ending. I was highly disappointed in this book, even for beach reading."
4,"Just as good as THE DA VINCI CODE, but no better","This one gets four stars as well and, I suppose, is worth being a bestseller, but isn't it about time people turned away from Dan Brown and looked at other truly worth authors and books? Especially science fiction and fantasy books like: THE LORD OF THE RINGS, ERAGON, THE TIME-TRAVELER'S WIFE, RINGWORLD, FOUNDATION, I,ROBOT, CHILDHOOD'S END, PUPPET MASTERS, RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA, NEUROMANCER, CRYPTONOMICON, SNOW CRASH, DARKEYE: CYBER HUNTER, and so forth."
5,Read Da vinci first (who didn't?),"I read THE DA VINCI CODE first and enjoyed it, then began to delve into Brown's other works, ANGELS & DEMONS being the next obvious choice. I actually enjoyed this book better than DA VINCI and would highly recommend it to anyone. The themes and characters are similar (and in some cases the same) as DA VINCI but this one is better put together, as though Brown took more time in the crafting of the book. Would also recommend two other books I've really enjoyed as of late: BIRTH OF VENUS, and Jackson MccRae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD"
4,I really liked this Dan Brown book as well,"Once again, I was pleasantly surprised and highly recommend this book by Dan Brown as well, just as I also recommend books from my first-love, science fiction, such as ""Foundation"", ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", ""Puppet Masters"", ""Childhood's End"", ""Neuromancer"", ""Cryptonomicon"", ""Darkeye: Cyber Hunter"". All are equally good in their own right."
3,Not as good as DaVinci,"I really enjoyed parts of this book, however there were some very big problems. The ending was deplorable. It became more and more unbelievable and just when you thought it couldn't get anyworse, there was an all-time new low put in concerning the ancestry of the villain. (which was totally unneccesary to the plot). As a scientist who is also a practicing Christian, I had a difficult time with Brown's premise that the two practices are mutually exclusive. Some of the violence is excessive and difficult to read. The symbology interpretations are still very intriguing however."
5,What an AMAZING book,"I expected this book to end one way, but then it completely changed and then changed again. The pace is fast and you'll actually learn something by reading it. A great book!!"
4,Excellent,"If you like to read books, this is your book, but even if you don't like to read, this is your book. It's a great book. It's a mind twirling book. There is a lot of stuff you can learn about religion and science as well.The only downfall of the book for me was that I figured the killer before the book was even in the middle,and this is why I gave it a four star, but other than that it was a very great book.I would recommend this book to young adults and older adults as well."
3,"for what it is, it's pretty good","If you're looking for good literature, this isn't the place to look. If you're looking for something to drag to the beach this summer, you've found it.Brown has a little more respect for his reader than the typical Grisham/Creighton fare - and that's what sets this book apart. The plot if farely formulaic - full of wild technology, quasi-mysticism, and plots to destroy society. However, Brown actually discussed and involves slightly more complicated topics that pop lit. He's mainly concerned with the ideological conflicts between science and religion, and is determined to instill his story with a decent amount of the spectrum of philosophies regarding this topic.That said, this is still is a fluffy, easy read - but certainly a notch above most of the other best-seller list crap."
3,Are characters not allowed to sleep in Brown's books?...,"Why do all of Dan Brown's novels begin and end in one 24 hour period? At the end of both TDC and A&D, I sat back and thought ""You know, Robert Langdon uncovered a plot to end Christianity, solved numerous ancient riddles, trotted the globe, partially fell in love and faced certain death several times....ALL IN ONE DAY. What the....???Let'em sleep a little, Dan. It'll help out with the realism since you won't need to conjure up jets that travel at Mach 15 to transport your characters across oceans in an hour."
3,"The same ""M.O>""","I read the Da Vinci code first, and completely devoured it in two days, so I figured I'd rewind and read Dan Brown's earlier work. Although I thoroughly enjoy his style of writing, the premise/plot is curiously similar to the Da Vinci Code. It is a good book, worthy of reading, but give yourself ample time between these two books so it doesn't feel like you're reading a prequel and sequel."
2,Naive,"Deposit your brain at the entrance before opening this book. You'll have to exercise your suspension-of-disbelief skills to a high level in order not to laugh too hard.Case in point: a scientist discovers the secret of Creation and a terrible weapon, then conceals it in a lab guarded only by a retinal scanner. Any security expert worth its salt will tell you that using a single biometric identification method without an associated code or passphrase is foolish.The plot is mildly interesting, but the characters are sketchy and stereotypical.What annoyed me the most, however, was pitting science and religion against each other as if they had been mortal enemies for centuries, which certainly is not the case. At one point, you get the impression that the Catholic Church is still clinging to creationist beliefs like bible-belt preachers, whereas it has accepted the evidence for Darwinian evolution for quite a long time."
3,a fun fast read--bring it to the beach,"Brown has written a fun and interesting thriller-one which combines science fiction, history and religion. This is the kind of book you should bring to the beach or on a plane-it's a quick read and will keep your interest until the end.When a scientist/priest is murdered under strange circumstances, Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor of iconography, is called in to explain the mysterious symbols carved on the dead man's body. Langdon notes that the symbols referred to the Illuminati-a heretical group which has battled the Catholic Church...but the Illuminati have long since disappeared...or have they?! Langdon sets out to discover if the Illuminati are still active and if they are behind the murder.You won't be sorry you read this-my only complaint was a minor one (as an historian of science, I have to point out that science and religion are not and have not always been in diametric opposition to one another"
2,A Dan Brown Disappointment,"Perhaps I should have read this Dan Brown novel BEFORE I read Da Vinci Code. Perhaps then I wouldn't be so disappointed in this slow-paced, oft predictable, & inexplicably BORING book! I was SO excited to read this novel, after all, Da Vinci Code is my favorite book of all time, but I quickly learned that this book was NOTHING like its attention-captivating successor. The plot is cumbersome and the ending is just plain STUPID!I have to give credit where credit is due, though. The ambigrams were amazing, and I appreciated the fact that the author gave his audience some visuals to aid in an otherwise boring reading experience. I also like the fact that I was able to learn from the novel. It was very informative, and one could easily tell that there was a vast amount of research put into the book. Also, at the end of the day, you can still tell that Brown is a very imaginative & descriptive author.But I have to give my overall opinion in this review: THE BOOK SUCKED!!!"
1,Disgustingly Bad Writing,"My teenage sister could have written better than this made-for-TV-movie author. Full of cliche characters and predictable plot turns, it would probably make a good TV movie. I'm perturbed to see that Dan Brown books have somehow become the most popular things to read. Even the Da Vinci code turned into a painfully bad movie."
3,The Devil Made Me Do It,"The characters are mostly one-dimensional, but it is the absolute evil of the antagonist and his henchmen that drives what is Dan Brown's pretty predictable terrain of the evilness within the upper-reaches of the Catholic Church.If the reader doesn't get too hung up with Brown's controversial musings, the framework for the story is actually pretty good; though he may have found the outline for the hero in a trash can outside Clive Cussler's home."
3,"OK action-thriller for passing time, but don't expect much more","In typical Dan Brown style, this book is all about creating action and suspense using blood, violence, a bit superstition, a little creative rewriting of history and some far fetched sci-fi, rather than creating a story that makes any sense. It's serves its purpose as a page-turner for passing idle time, but don't expect any scientific, geographical, linguistical og historical accuracy. It's so full of factual errors and self-contradicting statements that it sometimes switches from an action-thriller to a comedy. But if you're able to shut out reality for a few hours, there's some action packed time waiting for you just around the next page."
2,not that great...,"This book is incredibly overrated. The positives: The segments on Illuminati and Vatican history are interesting, and the book is fairly fast-paced.However, the plot is so ridiculously far-fetched it made me laugh out loud. I won't do any spoilers here, but the second half of the book is so insanely implausible and silly it's hard to read as good fiction. Every problem is solved like this: This is impossible; there's no way to solve this, impossible; but wait, one of the brilliant characters thinks really hard and comes up with the solution! This happens over and over again, and it gets tiresome. It's the Da Vinci Code all over but the plot is WAY more ridiculous.The strange thing about Brown's books is that many people take all the issues presented as being somewhat factual. This is a little scary. His books may be well-researched, but let's not forget this is FICTION, and amateurish, silly fiction at that."
3,A bit too out there,"This book was suspenseful and hard to put down. Around every corner there was a new mystery to unfold. I found the ending a bit bizzare and highly unlikely but still an entertaining read nonetheless. If chosing between this and the Da Vinci Code, opt for the latter."
2,a prequel disappointment,"How great was Rocky? Then Rocky 2 came out and it wasn't quite the same. Isn't that true for the most part? Nothing's like the original. Well, its reverse for the Dan Brown novel Angels and Demons. It actually precludes his best selling and very enjoyable Da Vinci Code (see my review). The Da Vinci Code had a great fast paced plot as well as historical tidbits that made me want to do some research. Angels and Demons has a weak plot and lags in many places. His ""historical items"" center around the Illuminati, a scientific anti-Church group. They rise again to attack the Church in the setting of modern Rome Brown could have had some great science vs. religion debate included in his novel but the dialogue falls short.Brown's novel is plagued with ""Harry Potter virus"". Like Potter's author Rowlings, Brown had one great book but his other works hasn't been able to capture the success of the best seller."
3,The plot is angelic and the writing demonic,"I wanted to like this book, I really did, but the writing is just awful. The characters are all cookie-cutter as are most of the situations. I was about to list a few examples but I don't want to be a spoiler.This said, the plot is fun (not quite angelic but I couldn't resist) and the pages do fly but all-in-all I could only recommend this to someone who's in the mood for brain-candy. As I have a taste for this at the moment I'm giving it a 3. On another day I probably would have awarded a 2."
5,The Ultimate Conspiarcy Book,"I had just recently heard about the Illuminati in a computer game that I've played, and I had become really interested in it ever since. I had searched around for something, a book at least, which pertained to that secret society, and nothing caught my eye like Angels and Demons did. By writing this book, Dan Brown has proved to the world that he is a genious. With such knowledge about everything that he covers in his book (from ambigrams, to anitmatter, to the Illuminati), it really makes you wonder whether Mr. Brown is an Illuminatus. :)"
2,Disappointing and Ridiculous,"After reading the Da Vinci Code, I was very anxious to read Brown's earlier novel, but was disappointed by how shallow and predictable it turned out to be. I thought it contained interesting information about the Vatican, art and the Illuminati but the characters seemed to be almost identical to those in the Da Vinci Code. I was particularly disappointed to see how little credibility the character of the Hassassin had. Obviously Brown had not researched Arabs or their way of thinking (or even their language) and just made the villain an Arab because it's fashionable to make the Arab the bad guy. All in all it wasn't a total waste of time, but I don't see what the fuss is all about."
2,You're Kidding!,"How is this book different from Da Vinci Code? Not very much, except that it is a much inferior read, and makes much less sense. The author seems to have written these two books in cookie-cutter style, with an unsuspecting protagonist, the close-of-kin lovely, a completely implausible plot, all rotating about an ancient sect that no one knew existed in today's world. It was a fast read, but a very poor one."
3,Some other Vatican?,"The suspense is compelling but Brown can't know much about the modern Roman Catholic church. He asks us to believe the Vatican is worried about having to defend Creationism when the 350-year-old Vatican Observatory is a leading institution of astronomical and cosmological research. For more see http://clavius.as.arizona.edu/vo/He also asks us to believe reasonably intelligent, educated people know nothing of anti-matter, that ambigrams are mysterious and shocking, and a few other groaners.Of course, I'm going to get right back to reading as soon as I send this."
2,Preposterous Plot,"Did I read the same book as the other reviewers? Although, the book was full of very interesting facts, they were interwoven into the story in a very annoying way. The narrative was overly melodramatic, amateurish, and sometimes downright silly. For people with a deadline to meet they sure had a lot of time to discuss everything to death. The plot was just plain ludicrous."
1,WORST BOOK EVER!!!,"Seriously, this is the worst book ever! Dan Brown obviously did NOT research this topic thoroughly. The author constantly contradicts himself from beginning to end. The book was total waste of time, and YES ... I did throw it against the wall! I didn't even bother finish reading it. I wish I would've wasted my time on the movie instead! I hope ALL the people that Dan Brown offends in the book find him and hang him by his tiny b#lls."
1,Ending was a big stinkbomb,"I loved the Da Vinci Code and loved 3/4 of this book. Then, suddenly, the reader is thrown into some pseudo ""Indiana Jones meets The Ten Commandments"" nonsense. Although the willing suspension of disbelief has its place in the literary world, the end of this book is garbage. Sorry Dan..."
2,Read the Da Vinci Code Instead!,"Yes, it's a page turner for awhile. But the plot is so ridiculous and implausible that it makes me long for the more realistic novels of Flaubert and the other classics. This book is nothing more than a cartoonish treatment for a bad Hollywood movie. Read Joseph Wambaugh instead if you're looking for fiction. Unfortunately, Brown's other earlier novels are just as awful so stick with the Da Vinci Code."
2,More Roman Catholic Bashing,"Here we go again. I read this book before I read the DaVinci Code; had I read the DaVinci Code first, and seen and read the reviews that exposed that book as a thinly-veiled anti-Catholic diatribe, I doubt I would have read Angels and Demons. If anything, Mr. Brown's hatred of and contempt for the Roman Catholic church is even more obvious in Angels and Demons. For Mr. Brown, the demons are the murderous, power-hungry members of the church hierarchy, as well as the self-deluded, moronic Catholic faithful. The angels, of course, are anyone who exposes the church for the poison it really is (to Mr. Brown, that is). Fool me twice, but not a third time - I'm finished with this author and his poison pen."
3,Fun Melodrama,"This is an absorbing if somewhat clumsy melodrama, which introduces the Robert Langdon character that became famous in ""The Da Vinci Code."" Langdon races to solve clues that will prevent the killing of leading Catholic Cardinals as well prevent the destruction of the Vatican. In the background is the tension between science and religion and the possibility of a grand theme uniting the two. This larger issue is not convincingly developed -- and the characters drawn are not quite believable. And the ending is reminiscent of a James Bond movie.Still, the book is a lot of fun."
1,How does this guy make a living at writing?,"As with all of Dan Brown's books, the writing is atrocious, but the story pace is the novel's salvation. In this case, the story is too flawed to carry the weight."
2,Is it over already?,"That's what I kept asking myself after the story got stale. I really liked the Davinci Code, so I was excited to read this. I must say, this book wasn't as interesting as the Davinci Code. There was a lot of promise, but in the end, I thought the story dragged a bit too long."
5,LUVED IT!!!!!!,"I read the Da vinci code and had no choice but to read Angels and Deamons. and guess what, i loved it. I'm only thirteen, but i read like any adult, and this is one of the greatest books of all time. i would steer you away from this author if your christian though. lucky for me, i'm not, so i wasn't at all offended by these books, and could simply enjoy them!!!"
4,"Not horror, but good.","I grabbed this book on my quest to find a new terrifying horror novel to read. Amazon had this listed near the top of the list in the horror section, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I must admit this book wasn't scary to me at all (more of a suspense/thriller type) but it was a great book. Very entertaining. I have never read a Dan Brown novel before but now I'm looking forward to reading more of them. A pleasant surprise. Now back to my quest!!"
3,"Exciting, but in a way - PLAIN","As the title says: exciting, but - plain. Why? Simply. For instance one minute you are in a roller coaster, next page you are buried by a cliché - so typical that you are wandering who is publishing this. If you are totally ignorant on any scientific topic, then maybe you will be whirled into a hurricane of his thriller, but if you at least know some algebra...though luck! Priest's daughter that doesn't know about conclave!? Weird, isn't it. Anyway, it's a good book for taking a break from some tougher subjects."
4,I LOVE DAN BROWN!,"I just want to start off by saying I LOVE DAN BROWN!ok, that being said... i actually read The Da Vinci Code before reading Angels and Demons, however i would recomend reading Angels and Demons first. i thought that Angels and Demons was very fast paced and easy to read. i love the writing style and the story itself was facinating. however, i thought that the ending was insanely far fetched. i understand that this is a work of fiction but the ending was a little carried away. i don't want to give anything away because i think that everyone should read it. even if you are not the religious or historical type it is still a good read."
4,A TARP???????,"This novel is very similar to Dan Browns other masterpiece, The Da Vinci Code. The action, mystery, and fun starts and doesn't stop. If you're looking for an entertaining ride into the Vatican and the order of the Catholic Church, then this is by far the book for you. I would recommend it to anyone, especially history buffs.The plot is also very good. Basically a Swiss scientist invents powerful 'antimatter' that puts thermonuclear bombs obsolete, only to have it stolen by the long-term anti-Catholic terror organization of the Illuminati. A great read!P.S. the title is intended for consideration after you read it."
5,A Mind Blowing Read,"This is the first of Dan Brown's books that I read and couldn't put it down. After all the ""hype"" surrounding The Da Vinci Code I guessed that if this book was any ""good"" then I would consider reading the Da Vinci Code afterwards. Wow! It was so much better than I anticipated. A great mix of fact and fiction and a plot that kept me captivated right until the last page.I couldn't believe how religion and science, with all its twists and turns, could be so interesting. Even after the book had finished I was hungry for more! A well researched, brilliantly written book. Bravo Mr Brown!"
2,NOT the Da Vinci Code,"What I loved about the Da Vinci Code was the imaginative plot and the suspense built around that plot. What I disliked about Angels and Demons was that it was very predictable, unbelievable, and therefore unsuspenseful. for me it was one of those books that is somewhat unbearable but I didn't stop reading it until 90% of the way through because I kept hoping it would get better. Finally, I gave myself a break and put it down."
3,could've been better,"The book was good, it defeinitly gave me many conspiracies i was not aware of, but the ending was too far fetched... it took it down by two stars."
3,"A Thriller, Nothing More","Like many other readers, I picked up ""Angels and Demons"" after finishing ""The Da Vinci Code"" and unfortunately, the two books are so similar that it made reading the second one almost a bore. Almost.Despite it's blaring similarities to ""The Da Vinci Code"" in plot, the story was suspenseful nonetheless and had me turning the pages in anticipation. But like with many other good thrillers, once I finished the book and knew the resolution, I had no wish of reading it again nor did I remember anything particularly striking about the book. The most disappointing part was that because Dan Brown uses the exact same plot format for both TDVC and A&D;, I figured out who the ""bad guy"" was half-way through the book.This is a great fun read but nothing about it is special. Even though I have similar feelings about ""The Da Vinci Code"", I found TDVC much more interesting than this novel."
2,Way Out There,"I admit to being sucked in by this one. But, after spending part of an evening reading it (it is a quick read), I was rather miffed by the ending, which was really implausible. The DaVinci Code has a much better ending."
3,Love It Or Hate It,"By now, you probably heard of Dan Brown's other book, ""The DaVinci Code"", the one he was famous for; this book ""Angels and Demons"" was written before the ""The DaVinci Code."" If you haven't read, ""The DaVinci Code"" or ""Angels and Demons"", I would recommend reading the ""DaVinci Code"" first. The reason for that is the main character in the book, Robert Langdon, was a little more believable in the ""DaVinci Code."" For example, there was a scene in ""Angels and Demons"" involving a helicopter that Langdon managed to get out of, that was a little unrealistic. Also the ending was a little disappointing. Up until the end, the book was a real page turner!"
4,Fun Read,"This book, although very similar to Da Vinci Code, is fun, intriguing, and quite a thriller. I really think Dan Brown did a better job with Angels and Demons than with Da Vinci Code."
4,Definitely Worth Reading,I liked this book very much. Lots of action and intrigue. There is also a lot of historical information in this one for history buffs.
4,"A long book, a fairly slow read, but interesting","The movie is never as good as the book. This was a good book but it was a bit slow and very long. I know i'm in the minority as everyone read this, but i think it could have been much shorter and equally as entertaining."
5,Another science & religion colliding suspense novel,"Dan Brown just has the mastery skills to deliver across the pages a view of religion and science without offending. He keeps his reader's hands gluded to the book, just free enough to keep turning pages. After reading Di Vinci code I was convinced Dan Brown had the open mind needed to turn heads, and creating a middle ground for Engineers to admit a creator, and religion to understand science as a way to appreciate that creator."
2,Ultimately Disappointing,"On the level of any pure thriller, this book is certainly engaging and will keep you turning pages.It is obvious that it is meticulously researched and plotted. Credit must be given for that. However, as the book nears it's conclusion, things get so outlandish, so preposterous and so completely removed from reality that I was extremely disappointed. It becomes a fantasy which given Brown's proud and careful researched-and-rooted-in-reality, ""notes"" in the beginning was an unexpected letdown."
3,About as far-flung as it can get,"I did not enjoy this book very much. Having read the Da Vinci Code and loved it, I may have been expecting too much. But make no mistake, Angels and Demons is NO Da Vinci Code! The characters were flat, and the ending of the book (last 200 pgs) are completely disapointing. It was not as enlightening (no pun intended) as Da Vinci nor does the reader learn as much about history, art, etc. I realized I didn't like where the end was heading (think Hollywood over-the-top) but only after I was about 400 pgs into the darn book and couldn't stop there. I put this book down with a scowl and an ""oh please"" rather than a ""wow!""."
3,Mixed Review,"I both very much like and dislike this book. I found it both engrosing and hard to put down but I also found it to too often delved into the improbable and the impossible. My first alarm was with the mach 15 aircraft that traveled from Boston to Switzerland in one hour. Plenty of twists and turns in the plot but they were often predictable; I spotted the bad guy way earlier than I liked and I found the ending to be very contrived to the extreme. Yes, it was a very captivating story but that was in spite of itself."
1,Can't believe this guy was published,"I just finished Angels and Demons by Dan Brown. A colossal waste of time. Book marked by cascading cliches, amateurish prose and characters that would not even fit in a comic book. This is perhaps the worst book I have read in forty years! I cannot believe this guy got published! The writing style would cause a high school sophomore in his first creative writing class to blush in embarrassment!"
2,shockingly poor!,"This can only be described as a quasi-literate, verbose novel with a transparent plot and annoying characters who are only as deep as the pages of the book. And the ending, sweet lord, I trust you I could not possibly be worse! Devoid of imagination, credibility, and literacy. Avoid!Quick cultural note to help you with your dialogue Dan: Aussies don't say ""aint"" and Italians have no idea what Kleenex is...."
2,It's like reading mud.,"While we all love a good yarn, full of adventure, Brown's prose is like slogging through quicksand. With cliches. It's totally unbelievable and poorly written on a literary level. It got me to the end, and I was curious to see how it turned out. It turns out preposterously. If you like serious literature, skip it. If you aren't very picky about the quality of the language - only a decent story to while away the hours - then ok. Go for it. Speaking of ""The Hours"", you should read that instead."
4,"Angels and Demons, a whole new meaning to thriller..","Before I start off on anything else, let me first say WOW! I read this book after reading The Da Vinci Code, because i was impressed with Brown's work in that book, and this one set the bar even higher. Between trilling trips around scenic Europe, romance and science, there was no reason for me to put it down. Brow sets up a scientific delema and and ingeniously combines it with a conspiricy from a cult hundereds of years old. I was astounded by all the twists and turns he puts his readers through. You may wonder, however, why i only rated it a 4. Brown has a brilliant way of taking fiction and making it almost believable. This book was different in the way that there were some thins that made me go 'wow, that couldnt happen.' However, that was the only flaw. Brown, once again gives a whole new meaning to thriller."
1,"If you've read The Da Vinci Code, you've read Angels and Demons","I was really excited to get my hands on this book. I'd heard raving reviews on it. Everyone said it's better than The Da Vinci Code. I finished reading it this morning, and felt like I wasted my time. This book had so many similarities to The Da Vinci Code it's not even funny. Guy gets murdered, his daughter/granddaughter has to help Robert solve clues to a puzzle before they both get killed. Bad guy is who you least expect. I'm surprised in The Da Vinci Code, Robert didn't say, ""Didn't I just go through this last year?"" It really made me lose respect for Dan Brown."
3,A rough draft of The Da Vinci Code,"Having read and enjoyed The Da Vinci Code, I decided to investigate Dan Brown's previous works. My first choice was Angels and Demons and the similarities between both works are glaring, to put it mildly. Don't get me wrong, it's quite an enjoyable page turner (although at times I felt like throwing the book against the wall and screaming ""ENOUGH!""), but the story stretches credibility to the breaking point. Like Da Vinci Code, Brown is very informative about Christianity and you do learn a great deal that you might not have known before - like the origins of that strange pyramid on the back of a dollar bill. Another plus is the very interesting plot twists at the end of the book that make reading it worthwhile."
4,Quicky Read,"I read The Da Vinci Code before reading this, which is good because if I had read this first, I would not have been as eager to read TDVC. TDVC was a better attempt at the plot and storyline. Angels and Demons kind of fizzles out towards the end. It seemed that it took almost 150 pages to end the final 2 hours of the story. The ending is what did it for me. Very disappointing and it becomes obvious that the author was having a hard time ending it and finding a place to stop. TDVC is much better and that is why I think I didn't like this story as much, so I gave it 4 stars. It was entertaining, but disappointing. Had I not read TDVC first, I may feel differently."
5,Absolutely riveting!,"One of the most fun & exciting books I have read in years. There are plenty of literary elitists that are obviously taking great pleasure in pooh-poohing this book from the standpoint of a few slightly inaccurate details (which I'm not sure are even inaccurate) & Brown's short chapter-high drama writing style, and to them I say LIGHTEN UP! This book is a great read, I tore through its nearly 600 pages in 2 days on vacation, & I never read books that quickly. It is action-packed, with no time for idle breaks as all the action takes place in about a 12-hour period. And the subject matter is interesting as hell, & I am neither Catholic nor a science buff. The plot has tons of great twists, & most of them ARE NOT predictable, despite the ravings of some other reviewers. I can't wait to read The Da Vinci Code now, especially since a lot of reviewers are saying it's very similar to A&D. If you want an exciting, enjoyable reading experience, just ignore the snobs & READ THIS BOOK!"
2,Not an engaging book at all,"What book were these other reviewers reading?!?The Illuminati lore is poorly researched, the plot painfully transparent, and the overall pace of the book is erratic.If you are stuck in an airport, and need SOMETHING to read, I guess this book is okay. You'll probably finish it by the end of the flight, and can safely dispose of it in the destination airport's garbage can."
3,"Nice ""3-Hour"" Tour of Rome","A novel that has great content of historical and esoteric theoretical fact, perhaps the best quality of this book is its teaching purposes for those who have a short attention span for art and/or conpsiracy theories. The story itself is captivating enough to keep the reader involved but it has its weak spots. The story continues to gain pace towards its climax but the pace becomes so rushed that confusion can ensue. The timeline is absolutely unbelievable. Towards the end I found myself skimming to keep up with the story! If the ""sexy"" aspect were removed, which cheapens the story, a woman running around Vatican City in her shorts, mentioned several times, and unnecessary, combined with the ending and her ridiculous actions, taking into consideration that her father had just been murdered, the ending was a disappointment. A good crowd pleaser. It DID keep me reading but not 100% satisfied."
1,Beware the Illuminati book,"This book is surprise after surprise after surprise -- but always presented in conversation. I haven't seen so much exposition since the movie Tora Tora Tora (which I actually like anyway). This book is a five hundred page repetitive cycle: personality-less people talking, teaching us some interesting history laced with a shocker or three; quick race against time to new location, arriving just too late; new person on scene inadvertantly, but luckily, provides a clue; lots more on-site educating and surprising."
1,blech,"So much has been said about Dan Brown's books it seems futile to contribute but for this one I had to: IT AIN'T WORTH IT. I bought this at the airport thinking that, like Da Vinci Code, it would be good company on the plane. My money would have been spent more wisely on Jackie Collins. Even the moderately entertaining scavenger hunt through Rome doesn't compensate for the heavy-handed and boring dogma, the unidimensional characters and overblown sentimentality (that's right, I said Jackie would have been better). The writing lacks whatever charm and big screen drama The Da Vinci Code possesses."
3,Interesting. Science Fiction.,"I read the Da Vinci Code before I read this book. When I read this book, I knew one of the main characters, the one you least expect, was the ""bad guy"" I just had to read the whole thing to see why he did it. (That is Dan Brown's formula.)It was interesting but the first half of the book about CERN and the conclave... BORING!!! The story did not pick up until the first cardinal was suppose to be murdered. As I was reading, it seemed to be getting more like science fiction than fiction, no pun intended. It was an easy read but I liked the Da Vinci Code better."
4,spellbinding,"an intriging, fast-paced, action-filled storyline that will keep you guessing untl the very end. it makes you think hard about your own views on the science/religion debate and the realities we are facing in this new age that will require a changing view of reality. excellent read."
2,most absurd plot,"I was reading it during my visit to Rome and it was so promising at first and impossible to put down until the final twists of plot when the whole thing became so absurd that it ceased being exciting and instead you felt manipulated, your intelligence insulted and felt your time was wasted for nothing, as if you watched a thriller movie and could not really walk out of a theater. For those interested in Roman sites mentioned in this book, and in Rome in general I recommend instead Morton's ""A traveller in Rome""."
4,Fantastic!,"This book is AMAZING! Dan Brown is now my new literary god! I dont care what the controversy is about him and his books, the bottom line is that the books are FICTION, and that is what people should take into account. He uses ?historical facts? and runs with them: Many movies are the same way, they use real elements and run with them.The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 Stars is that it is almost the same Design as The Da Vinci Code. He got away with it because, for lack of a better description, Angels and Demons was a Flop. He didnt become a household name until Da Vinci. Langdon is there, the beautiful granddaughter/female sidekick/intelligent female is there, the religious, or anit-religious symbology, the secret society, the trail through Europe, the tough as nails cop, and so on....Other than that it was SUPERB. When reading it, seperate it from the Da Vinci Code and take it as a different work and u will enjoy it."
5,"Yes, this one was better","Ok, so maybe I like the Catholic Church better, but I thought this one was better than his first one (I'm assuming it was Da Vinci Code). This one moved at a fast pace, especially towards the end. In fact, I liked this book so much I ended up reading all of his books. They're all good. Go read this one if you liked Da Vinci Code. Then read his other ones."
2,Written Well - Bad for Society,Angels and Demons like the Da Vinci Code was written very well I thought. These books both keep you reading and wondering what is going to happen next. They are however both going to contribute to societal decay. That makes them harmful rather then just inert entertainment. I have read them both but many with little faith or knowledge seem to be treating them as fact instead fiction sprinkled with a few facts. Since societal evolution is so important I cannot recommend this book.
2,Completely ridiculous!!!,"The only redeeming quality of this book is it takes you on a modest tour of Rome, a city I LOVE. However, the writing is so melodramatic and the ending just blatantly insulting to one's intelligence, that I finished this book with a giant roll of the eyes and promptly opened a bottle of wine to erase the memory of what I'd just read."
2,"Factually inaccurate, but mildly entertaining","After reading a lot after Pope John Paul's death last year, I learned a lot about the church and the Papal election. After reading this book I questioned the research and factual accuracy of this book and it has to bring into question the factual accuracy of Dan Brown's other books.Aside from that...if you can get past it, the book is an entertaining summer read."
1,It doesn't live up to the hype,"It has been a while since I read this book. For a thriller, though, it was anything but exciting, and rather than being a page turner, I contemplated putting the book down after every page and never picking it back up again.I will not argue that Mr. Brown is a very intelligent individual. Intelligence, however, does not guarantee you will be a good writer.The plot itself was predictable, and the writing style never changed to convey a change in feeling from a night at home to a ride in a helicopter soon to explode with antimatter. Brown relies heavily on thought verbs to carry him, to the point that he seems incapable of producing any real action.In the end, the only reason I am glad I read this book was that I learned a small amount about the Illuminati. That, however, is not worth the investment of reading 569 pages. Do yourself a favor and read a classic that you have been meaning to read."
1,Disjointed Action Thriller,Let's keep it simple. This thing is predictable and all over the place . Very surfacy development of characters and parts that were not believable. I was truly disappointed in the ending and I do NOT recommend this book.
1,brain candy for the brainless,"I was told to read this before the The Da Vinci Code. The story is pure drivel and the writing is wretched. The bogus ""miracles"" at the end are just the cap on a collection of incredible (in the strictest sense) plot gyrations that induce a mental gag reflex. The text is replete with numerous stylistic and even a few grammatical boners. The writing is ""hack"" at best. Don't waste your mind or your time on this. I certainly won't bother with the Da Vinci Code."
4,Rome is wear the lair is.,"Holy cow! Rome was the destination for my honeymoon, so when the book landed in Rome and started going to the various sites, I was in heaven, easily able to recognize what was being described. It takes on a whole new meaning when you have stood in front of the fountain where Langdon fights for his life. When my wife and I were in Rome, are running gag was ""turn a corner see a fountain, take a picture."" Thus, many of the referenced fountains in the book are in our photo album. I was like a kid a Christmas reading this book.It was incredibly fastpaced and very entertaining. Too often I read reviews here that criticize authors for geographical errors or minor misspellings relating to other languages (Latin or Italian in this case). If you are truly that picky, read a non-fiction book or better yet an encyclopedia. I don't know Latin from Spanish, so who cares if its wrong or not. i'm interested in the story. Bottomline is, this one is just as ripe as Da Vinci Code for a movie."
3,Good Book - Not for everyone,"I started out loving Angels and Demons (very interesting plot) but somewhere along the way I began to question a lot of things. My first complaint is that Brown writing style can be termed ""overly descriptive"" which is probably why the book is so long. The description of how a particular sequence makes the characters feel is far much longer than the dialogue.I have gotten over the fact that all the action takes place in one day but I still can't get over the ending. The plot progressed nicely from the beginning but Brown completely messed with it at the end. The book isn't for everyone. SOme may like the many sometimes unrealistic twists and turns but others may have liked the book to have less than one false ending.Overall it was a good read. I may read another of his books"
3,Comic Book Escapes Killed an Excellent Thriller,"I agree with Ms. Lucia of Dallas Tx. The Illuminati was the perfect villain. The premise of the book was unprecedented, the insight into the Science and Religion, the detail travel through the dominant structure of the smallest country in the world was thrilling, and spellbinding.I was in love with this book UNTIL about the last 50 pages. Then Brown seemed to not know where to take his main characters, or how to close out the book. He started using comic book type escapes and that pin pricked the crescendo he had built up in his reader.I have not read The Da Vinci Code. If it is as everyone says very much like Angels & Demons then I don't think I will purchase it. I think I will wait and borrow it from a friend."
4,great story,"i enjoyed this book, i coulnd't stop reading because there is just so much to be read and found out as the plaot develops. i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because the last 60 pages or so stunk. the cardinal thing and all that was bogus and it got stretched just a little too far. good effort Mr. Brown i hope to read more of your books."
4,World Class Adventure,"Probably the best of Dan Browns novels, which covers historical facts crossed with a great fiction adevnture/thriller ride which leaves you to think long after the last page and even question your own religion."
3,movie paced with no real depth,"A decent story. At times Browns writing can be almost hardcore sci-fi and other times its amateurish. If the characters seem like their at a dead end you can always expect the word 'suddenly' to pop up. ""Robert is stuck with no where to go.But Suddenly, he finds a magic key in his pocket""... I was thrilled at the end of the story, I swore I knew who would end up being the bad guy, but as if Brown felt insecure with the climax he went on and on. Almost trying to justify the end so that he would not offend anyones faith with the conclusion. If you like movies you'll love this book but dont expect anything too captivating."
3,Nothing special,"I don't quite understand the big noise about this book, but I guess it's because of The Da Vinci Code, which I found very gimmicky. I just want to ask if authors masquerading as customers (like Victoria Taylor Murray) are going to write reviews that they please learn how to spell and construct sentences. I feel sorry for their poor editors."
2,Dan Brown thinks your dumb,"Is there action? Yes.Historical intrigue? You got it.Romance? Yeap.So what's the problem.The problem is it's all just so conveniently wrapped in a thick cloth of unbelievable coincidence and painfully dumb prose. Brown acts as if audience has an IQ of 12. He endlessly explains and reminds the audience of facts that any reasonably educated adult should know. What's worse he explains these facts by way of the characters, who are all highly educated albeit in different fields. The net effect was painful irritation to the point were I had to set the book down and walk away. I did make it through, since the premise and the overall story are quite compelling and I wanted to see how it would end. If only this idea had been developed by a writer like Haruki Murakami instead of Dan Brown.I have not read or seen the De Vinci Code and I can't imagine I will. Not even 1,000 angry, albino monks can make me."
3,Angels & demons,I thought this book was very good. Great imagination and very well thought out. A very fast paced adventure. A real roller coaster ride that really is about Science vs. Religion. Very thought provoking but a little far fetched at times. Well worth reading.
3,Read this first...,"I had the unfortunare circumstance of reading this book after the DVC. This story, while interesting, did not draw me in like DVC or even Desperation Point for that matter. However, the small bit of backstory it does provide is useful if you read the books in order. I am a big fan of Dan Brown and this was a solid starting point for his Langdon books, but certainly a starting point."
2,Skip it and read Da Vinci Code,"This book starts out practically the same - complete unoriginality, but at least he did it better in Da Vinci. Read this one first so it only get better, or just skip it. This one was a little tedious, although it had a lot of the same elements. Big disappointment after Da Vinci Code which I loved and finished in a day or two."
4,"Good, but not great, read","The author does a really good job of blending many aspects of the story line together, but in the end, I was a bit unfulfiilled. Still an excellent read, however. wwr@virginia.edu"
2,Worst book by Dan Brown,"I did not care for the last 100 pages of this book. I do enjoy Dan Brown's writing, however this book is a mess."
2,"Entertaining, but an obvious agenda (Spoilers below)","I really liiked this book for the first 600 pages or so...MUCH better than the DaVinci Code.But then the true Dan Brown kicked in with his anti-Catholic agenda. (For the record, I am neither Catholic, nor devoutly religious)He writes a tremendously stirring speech about religion and science which, in my opinion, is among the best I've read. But then, since he just can't STAND to have the Catholic church look good in any way, he makes the character who delivered that speech a crazy psychopathic zealot and the ultimate villian of the story, thus wiping out all the credibility and reason of the earlier speech.He did this anti-religion crap in DaVinci Code and he does it here as well.Having said that, if you have to pick one book or the other, pick this one. It's a much better read.It's just too bad he can't let go of his agenda to discredit modern religion. He's just another liberal mouthpiece in that regard."
2,Dan Brown is overreaching,"In Angels and Demons, Dan Brown was seriously overreaching. The book is a fiasco and the ending does NOT make sense at all. I don't know how he built this whole story.I do give him credit for his writing abilities, which earned him 2 stars for this book."
1,Not if you've got a brain,"The plot twists and turns with today's style and the author's inaccuracies on just about everything could be ignored to make this an enjoyable read. However, his allusions to how non-believers can have no morals, and for me a wonderment of why his book attacks the Order of the Masons as being Satanic has made me decide that when I force myself to finish the book I will never read another of his. The world does not need his new versions of torture, nor his misconceptions about the world around him. I've read other somewhat preachy books - one about the millenium being when Christ is reborn that were thrilling and wonderful. I know this book is fiction, but I also know that people read and take a lot of print as truth, or at least the ideas in them. Dan Brown's ideas are of no worth and destroy what fun there could be in reading this book."
2,Not Worth The Time,"Angels and Demons would be a wonderful book if Dan Brown could write. The premise is compelling, the anagrams are fascinating, the science presented is interesting.The problem is that the pace is off, the characters too easily solve the puzzles(no new information has been presented about the current conundrum, but somehow, the answer that has elluded our imminent symbologist heretofore suddenly pops into his brain--just in the nick of time to avoid death and destruction. That scenario is believable one time, but Dan Brown does it again and again.), and the attacks on the church eventually began to annoy this reader.I was hoping for an intelligent thriller...instead, I got a book that just couldn't deliver. Umberto Eco and even Michael Connelly are much more worthwhile authors."
2,it's just ok,"as someone already said, ""improbably, boring, dull, and over the top."" the beginning of the book was good and pulled me in, but the rest of the book gradually left me wanting more. the main character runs around on a wild goose chase escaping from death in the most unbelievable and ridiculous ways. he had too many unlikely escape from death experiences and ""oh yea i've got it"" momments to make me puke.if you like run of the mill and luke warm fiction this is for you. if your favorite books are bought from the impulse isle in the grocery store then this is for you."
1,Absolute rubbish !!,"Having just finished the very dark, bleak, and hopeless but totally brilliant `Out' by Natsuo Kirino, I decided to treat myself to some light reading for a change. I thought that this book would be just perfect.I must admit that I'm not a great fan of Dan Brown. I have read the DaVinci Code and wondered what the fuss was/is all about. But this one is even worse . The characterization is amateurish, the characters in Enid Blyton kiddie books are better etched, the premise seems like an excuse for Mr Brown to parade his poorly researched knowledge, the plot is as transparent as cellophane paper...I wonder how Mr Brown has become so popular, clever marketing I suppose.A complete disappointment. Be warned."
3,Angels and Demons: Bilge or Bon Mot?,"Even with it's imbecilic plot and dunderheaded verbiage, this is an entertaining book. If you find yourself one weekend with nothing to do after you scrub your friendly canine or polish your toenails, then this is the book for you. Be forewarned, however...the anticlimactic (gee, is it any coinicidence that The Da Vinci Code was anticlimactic, as well?), ludicrous ending is hardly worth the read. I realize that when perusing Angels and Demons one must keep in mind that it is what it is...fiction. For that reason the story up to a certain point is entertaining. The plot twist at the end, however, is so entirely outrageous that I would have liked Brown's work much better had I stopped two-thirds of the way into the book."
5,I like this better then Da Vinci Code,"This is a fast pased prequil that you do not have to read any of the other books for. While Dan Brown got the Papal elections and some hisorical facts wrong, it was a great thriller and was well written. If you haven't done so, read this one.Dan Brown takes on the Catholic Church in a conspricy involing the downfall of the church and it secrets. Protected by a secret sect called the illiminati, a group of inteltuals who see science as thier religion. It is centeres aourd the the Vatican the art of some of it's compatriots.I had a hard time puting this one down."
5,A fun ride,"While I enjoyed The Da Vinci Code more, Angels & Demons was a fun, hard-to-put-down read. Dan Brown knows how to keep his readers' attention. I did find one little part of the story toward the end to be a little hard to swallow, but I won't say what it is here as I don't want to spoil it for anyone.If you like fast-paced mystery/thrillers, then you should enjoy Angels & Demons."
1,Yet another failure...,"This book is a book written by an author thinking that his readers are feebleminded. He's aiming for an audience that doesn't know fact from fiction and won't bother to look up what they don't know. Again he tries desperately to meld fact (very few things in this book are accurate) and fiction, and it just results in something too predictable and really dumb."
5,A great read,"The subject matter may be quite in-depth but the pace keeps youreading. Following the complex storyline isn't always easy because of the quantity of detail and historical context, however the ongoing ""chase"" and the multi-twisted ending make it worth the effort. Not wanting to give anything away, but some of the happenings at the end did catch me out. I've yet to read The Da Vinci Code, but I hope I find it as good."
4,Very good read - could not put down,This was a fairly well written book that was hard to put down - a fair number of twists and turns and a good logical progression of events. The tie in to actual places and history made it seem all the more real. Good job!
5,One of the best!,You won't be able to put this book down! I read this before the Davinci code and actually liked A&D better. The author has a brilliant and imaginative mind. It's so interesting how he uses actual little known facts about secret societies and papal codes and intertwines them with such a supsensful story.
2,Hackwork from a Google Searcher,"The prose is incoherent. The storyline incomprehensible (and unbelievable). The characters are straight out of a Hollywood blockbuster scripted by Donald Rumsfeld, complete with an Arabic bad guy who's portrayed as a savage. The ""clues"" are hokey. And I swear, if Dan Brown wrote, ""He was not prepared for what would happen next"" one more time, I would personally send him my undergraduate fiction writing textbook free of charge."
3,A nicely done thriller,"This is a good, quick read. Intriguing plot, history, art, and architecture come together to make an unusually intellectual thriller. If you've read the Da Vinci Code, you'll recognize a similarity in plot, but not so much so that it's not worth reading. The plot centers around an ancient cult bent on destroying Catholicism. The impending death of the Pope is opening a window for them to effectively dismantle a huge part of Western Christianity. Our hero follows cryptic clues around Rome in an attempt to save the day.Dan Brown is a really good writer. This would have gotten more stars if this and the DaVinci Code didn't have so much in paralell. I felt like he used this as a training vehicle for the later book. That's a shame, because it's enjoyable to read a book where the author has really done his research."
2,book summarized in beginning!,"don't be fooled! the whole story was summarized at the beginning of the book leaving no suspense at all (unlike the da vinci code)! i was bored and had trouble keeping my eyes open most of the time. consequently, i only finished 2/3 of the book and decided enough was enough. i went ahead to began another book and never looked back.A&D only peaked my interest after being blown away by the DVC, which im sure holds true for many others. i have to say that i'm truly disappointed with A&D and am skeptical about brown's other work. i just hope the sequel to DVC will live up to its potential (DVC II expected release date is Summer 2005)."
2,Too short. Over priced.,I work in a hotel Garde Manger kitchen and a lot of people at work have carrot curlers. I bought this one and was very disappointed. the hole that the carrot goes in is smaller compared to the other curlers. also the other curlers have a groover on the other side witch this one doesn't. If you are thinking of buying one buy the Narpo Curler its cheaper and better!
3,book,"One word...weird. That's right this book is just plain weird and not in the good kind of weird, just weird."
3,eeh . . .,"The first 45 minutes of this film is rapidly engaging and very, very good which makes it worth the three star rating I gave it. Jacob and Marie find themselves in one interesting predicament after another but once they reach Spain and discover their Uncle had passed away the movie totally disengrates into this stupid tale of incestuous jealousy, violence and stupid actions. What a waste of what could have been a promising film."
1,Irresponsible Seller,The dvd has problems. I suspect it is probably a pirated copy. It does not play well on my TV. It stops at certain point and clips the images. I cannot watch it. So I tried to return it to the seller. He said it was over 90 days and he did not do anything about it.
5,Science and Politics Mix,"Another reviewer is disappointed in this ""lightweight book with a niceplot"". The backdrop of declining American science and ignoblepoliticos may indeed seem to be an odd and unimportant couple (comparedto, for example, WWII), and in part old hat. I disagree, and welcomethis short novel with interesting characters in Washington, Waxahachieand JPL. Insiders will enjoy references to ApJ, Physics Today,Terrestrial Planet Finder, in addition to the SSC. I hope the required""science talk"" will not bore the broader audience. I fear that therequired ""political talk"" is not as well-informed as the science talk,but then everybody expects venial politicians: the comic relief for thenovel. (I'm reminded of a movie rating: ""mild peril"".) A shortfast-paced romp -- no car chases or murders [other than the SSC] -- ""anice plot"" that did not disappoint me."
3,Delightful,"I'm a bit baffled by the negative reviews this has received. No, it doesn't have the epic scale of The Caine Mutiny, but it's a fascinating, fun story nevertheless. The subject matter is genuinely unique; who else has written a realistic novel about the intersection of science, politics, and entertainment?My only criticism is that even though this is definitely a contemporary novel, much of the dialogue has an old-fashioned quality. The characters frequently use idioms and expressions that aren't heard much anymore, like ""hat in hand"" and ""cat got your tongue,"" and the bantering between the scientist and the congresswoman sounds like something out of a 1940s movie.If you're tired of political thrillers with implausible plot twists, you may find this refreshing. It's a quick, fun read."
1,A STEP BACKWARD IN TIME,"I did not realize that Wouk is 90. I guess, at that age, this book is "" acceptable "". But, otherwise the only words applicable are mawkish, awkward, clunky, predictable;maybe, even embarrasssing; you take my meaning.As Ebert and Roeper are wont to say ""two thumbs down, way down"".Memory brings back the ""War ---"" books and Marjorie Morningstar.I read them when they first appeared; and liked them alot. That gives away my age.Good luck, Herman. We are brothers."
2,Disappointing Book,"This is a lightweight book with a nice plot. Well below the marvelous historical novels in the Winds of War era and his earlier novels: Caine Mutiny, Marjorie Morningstar and City Boy."
2,Almost Bad,"Boy, I have to tell you this book was bland. Weak plot, not much of interest happened. References to the SSC were a stretch sometimes. Another reviewer's comparison to Dan Brown was laughable. Dan Brown's works are head and shoulders above this one.I guess if you just want to spend a coupla hours exercising your eyeballs, then go ahead and get it. Otherwise, save your money."
4,ALMOST great,"The premise was intriguing, and the first few pages sucked me in immediately. It is nice to read something upbeat with decent, nondisfunctional characters and a happy ending for a change. And there were some good points made about our political processes. I put it down with a smile.That being said, the middle dragged,and the characters, except for the late-appearing female Chinese scientist, were appealing but not really interesting.As a science fan, I was very disappointed that the book was not better. If it had achieved its potential, perhaps there would be hope to revive the SSC after all...."
4,high stake sub-atomic physics,"I was intrigued by the idea that Herman Wouk was still writing books, and being a native Texan, was attracted to the title. The story involves an astrophysicist who was formerly involved in the now defunct Superconducting Supercollider. Now he gets involved in the national uproar over the Chinese discovery of the Higgs Boson (which the former SSC was supposed to find) and the potential superbomb it might enable. Our hero gets connected with a romantic congresswoman, his former Chinese love, a zealous reporter, many lawyers, and former academic colleagues. And to top it all off, he must save his marriage while keeping America safe. This light hearted romp is interesting."
4,A good story,"See storyline above.This is a pleasant and amusing novel from an author who hasn't lost his knack of storytelling. I liked the subject matter (Colliders, etc) and the small education about the Higgs boson (When you get on the scale in the morning, you may be hoping that it registers a smaller number than the day before -- you may be hoping that you've lost weight. It's the quantity of mass in you, plus the force of gravity, that determines your weight. But what determines your mass?).The story moved at a steady pace and kept me entertained."
4,Engagingly light reading on a heavy subject,"I am a serious book collector. Paperbacks are for amateurs, so to speak. This novel is certainly not of the caliber of earlier works by Wouk, but, that is more a reflection of the times, not the author. Living in Texas through the SSC fiasco I appreciate that it is lost but not forgotten. As a published scientist I relate to the troubles in funding, partcularly in reference to pure, hard, science. The need for long term research has been expounded by the National Research Council, although the commitment is great and the rewards tenuous, it is a fundamental need, no longer suited to academia. Quick, often flawed research is the only feasable route today. I appreciate Wouk's grasp of the politics involved in science and the short-sightedness of policy makers. This is more than enough to make the novel worth reading."
4,"Funny, well reseached book on the politics and science of the elusive Higgs boson.","This funny, well written book imagines the scientific and political reaction when, after the US government shut down the super collider in Texas in 1993, the Chinese had then discovered the Higgs boson a few years later. Shades of the shock that the Russian launch of Sputnik in 1958 did to US politics, education, and scientific funding.Wouk, as usual, superbly weaves together the rivalries and excesses in Congress, the US and international scientific communities, and even Hollywood's search for hit movies. You are drawn into the characters and through all the political backstabbing, Hollywood excess, and scientific rivalry, they remain believeable and sympathetic."
4,A Hole in Texas,"An interesting read but not up to Herman Wouk's best work! But, I sent a copy to my granson who is in to Physics. It should give him some persepctive in how federal grant funding can affect scientific research decisions."
2,A Hole in Texas: A Novel Herman Wouk,"A Hole in Texas: A NovelHerman WoukThis book was recomended to me my a friend. He thought it was one of the best novels he had read.I like have particularly liked Herman Wouks work in general, but found this novel uninterseting.Fortunatly the price was remarkably low, and the shipping prompt.."
2,Should have used a pen name!,I sit here and wonder not what mister Wouk was thinking when he took on the challenge of making a superconductor and it's scientist interesting but what the negative reviewers would have written had he published under the pen name Pug Henry and not revealed his true identity till a year or two later. I got the feeling while reading the reviews that the majority of negative reviews were so not because it's a bad book it's not it's not war and peace but neither are the last 4 books I read it's a decent little light piece of literature written by a 90 yo genius who has earned the right to write one and should be judged on it's own merits and not as a contrast and comparison of all of his works.
2,I changed my mind,"I gave this DVD two stars when I started using it. Since I bought it I decided to give it a try after 5 or 6 times of doing it, After couple times, I began to enjoy it, I feel that I'm working out my legs, but, arms, etc. without hurting or exhausting myself. I think the poses have helped strenghten my legs and will see the benefit during labor. I would recommend this DVD if you want a workout without the sweat."
2,"Uninspiring, hard to enjoy this","the reviews seem to be written by students of Rocki, and not video exercisers. Rocki is was too serious and doesn't inpsire you to stick with it, even some of the more difficult moves. The setting is ok, but al in all I found Leisa Hart's FITMAMA dvd to be way better, easier to do and the results I got from it were excellent, so I do not recommend this dvd(which i sold at ebay!)."
5,Rocki is awesome,"I am lucky enough to live in L.A. so I went to Rocki's classes religiously when I was pregnant with my first baby and I credit the yoga with my easy labor & delivery, as well as feeling great during my pregnancy. Now that I have a toddler and am expecting baby #2, it is hard for me to get away for classes but the video is a great substitute (and much cheaper!)"
1,Disappointed - DVD NOT closed captioned as advertised,"This review does not have anything to do with the content of the DVD but rather, my shopping experience in purchasing said DVD. As of 09/08/11, in Amazon's product description page, it is indicated that this DVD, along with Vol 2 and 3, has closed captioning for the deaf and hard of hearing. Upon receiving this DVD, I found out that the DVD offered no captioning OR subtitle features. I spoke with Amazon and suggested that they remove the captioning claim so future customers with hearing loss won't make the same mistake; the response I received was that my suggestion would be taken into consideration at this time. If you are purchasing this DVD and want to use its captioning feature, please know it isn't available on these DVDs (Vols. 1-3)."
4,good beginner type yoga,"Good relaxing dvd. I felt like I got a lot out of it, I enjoyed that they put the kegels in there, which forces me to do them! This is not a challenging workout for someone of average fitness. It left me feeling great. I would recommend it."
2,Rocki's Prenatal Yoga,"This DVD does not visit traditional yoga poses as I had expected. There are a lot of breathing exercises and floor exercises, such as leg lifts. This DVD also tends to be bland in terms of set and color."
1,"Rocki's Prenatal Yoga, Vol.1","This was the most boring yoga workout that I have ever seen. If it's not bad enough that you're tired from being pregnant, this DVD puts you to sleep. I understand that yoga is supposed to relax a person, but this is severe boredom. The poses are not being held long enough to receive the benefits of the stretch and the routine itself is long and drawn out."
5,Complete without being exhausting!,"This combo workout, relaxation and meditation is a great way to tune into your new baby without the chanting, incense-burning stuff that I don't like about some yoga classes. The workout is easy to follow and gentle and after it's done I feel energized and calm. Rocki's a wonderful teacher and goes through each pose slowly enough to be able to follow easily. The women are real-looking pregnant women - not stick-figure models, which is much better to look at when you're pregnant. I loved the section when you focus on your baby. Talk about early bonding! I highly recommend this. Next I'm trying Rocki's Labor Prep."
2,"Poor instruction, uninspiring positions","Like other reviewers, I found this DVD to be dull but mostly, I felt Rocki did not explain the modifications for the poses very well. I'm 8 1/2 months pregnant and my life is all about modifications these days!The program opens with the actresses all finishing up their squats, so I suppose you're supposed to do these (Rocki suggests you do 10, 20 or 30) on your own before pressing ""play."" The next pose is a sitting pose that is very uncomfortable and cuts off circulation to the legs (and, rather than relaxing, I sit and worry about varicose veins.)My biggest complaint is the series of pilates moves to strengthen the hips and buttocks, which is right in the middle of the program. I benefit tremendously from the hip loosening aspects of yoga in the first half of the program, only to flex and tighten my hips up again 5 minutes later. It feels counter productive.If you're thinking about this DVD, I'd suggest checking it out from the library first. I'm glad I did."
5,Fantastic,These are great. Love that they are healthy and gluten free. Sad to see I can't get them Subscribe and Save anymore.
2,"great taste, stock way too old & hard","I've had these bars on ""Subscribe & Save"" for perhaps a year. When the stock is fresh, they are great. The last two shipments, though, were enough to break teeth. Don't know whether Amazon doesn't replenish stock often enough or Oskri sends them old ones. I've cancelled my subscription."
3,"This book is not focused, though it has some good stuff.","In the preface, the authors say that they intend to write this book about ""selling by email"" (not about selling on the web). The intent of this book is not fully communicated by its title. So make sure you buy what you want to read.I do not find the chapters about ""selling by email"" particularly interesting and convincing, perhaps because it was not the reason I bought the book. It has a chapter in glossary format explaining what is ""Browser"", ""Bit"", ""Byte"", ""Home page""..., things that need not to be explained in a book that already is too thin and has too much white space.The only serendipity is chapter 8 about ""Banners"" which is related to the web and has nothing to do with email. The authors give an insightful distinction between a banner and a link, and provide examples to improve the description of a banner. This book stays on my bookshelf because of this chapter."
1,I'm Very Disappointed.,"Like one of the readers said, ""I bought this book because of the posted reviews."" Unfortunately, it's well below my expectations. The author is a good writer, however, I don't think he has much experience with email writing. He used very little examples in the book and spent an entire chapter to define common Internet terms such as ""Bit"" and ""Browser."" It appeared to me that this book is put together without much experience with the Internet. Two other books: ""Words that Sell"" and ""What's the Big Idea?"" are much, much better. I'm returing CyberTalk for a refund."
5,Fisher Price fish rattle,This was a Christmas present for our four month old granddaughter. She loves playing with it and of course with teething the different forms on its surfaces are used with zeal.
2,Not great for little ones,"My little one is 4 months and is definitely not ready for this rattle. She can easily grasp it and make it to her mouth, however it is really top heavy and the very hard plastic fish whacks her in her head because she is not strong enough to control it. I used the seahorse one with my older girl and that one was much easier for a baby to manipulate. I will try this again several months from now. Teething will happen for quite some time."
3,too fast,"This symphonie is done too fast, much too fast. Why I do not know. Good for begiunners but for DECCA Herbert Blomstedt for instance has made a much better recording. That one I prefer. Music quality is allright."
4,BLACK HUMOR?,"This is a rare film. The characters are likeable, no villian insight except life's unpredictability. The young man, a teenagerwith a fatal illness, is portrayed as a normal kid who adapts tothe inevitable with humorous results. While the plot might seemunlikely, it manages to incorporate so much positive energy that we can identify with each individual as they adapt to the reality of the situation. Teenagers will find themselves able toidentify with the main character. But the whole family will beable to empathize as his friends and relatives cope with humorand sensitivity to their loss."
3,"sad story, decent movie","It's a sad story, of course, but I thought it was done well. I found interesting the parts in the movie where the main character, the high school boy suffering from terminal cancer, would make comments about his death that would make every one else extremely uncomfortable when they accidentally said something without really thinking it through. It seemed quite realistic. I can't imagine going though the struggle of dealing with death, knowing you are leaving behind your loving mother and friends. I thought the mother-son relationship was very sweet."
3,Dying Lite,"It's a good enough movie. It doesn't shy away from serious issue and I give it points for staying away from sentimentality and bathos. I wasn't too involved with the film, however. There was an air of detachment that prevented me from caring overmuch about the characters. The performances all around were good (the three principles, Cynthia Nixon, Michael Angarano, and Sunny Mabrey, especially). A good but not great movie."
2,Meh.,"There was promise at the beginning that this could be a good non-sentimental movie about a young boy coming to terms with his imminent death. So, we have to suspend our disbelief when he takes off for New York to woo a supermodel. Alright, I can do that. But then we have to add in a bit of a subplot with the old mom going for evening strolls with the good-looking football player. It was really one too many impossible relationships for me to buy into. The movie went all over the place, and not in a good way. Felt like they were BSing their way through to the end of the movie. And all the flashback/hallucinations got tiresome fast. It's not that there weren't any redeeming qualities to the movie, but that those qualities were diluted and squandered by the end."
4,"The more strange, the better","I was enchanted and stirred by this film. It begins very much grounded in sad realities --a teenage boy dying of cancer, his widowed mother bereft as she tries to help him pass away with as much happiness and dignity as possible. But as the story unspools itself, it moves beyond reality -- in fact, beyond expectation -- as the young man edges toward ever closer communion with his late father, with spiritual truths, and with his own earthly and adolescent dreams. The more strange and ethereal this story got, the more I enjoyed it. The performances are true and compelling, particularly Michael Angarano's and Cynthia Nixon's. This was a movie I happened on almost by chance, and not the sort I would have normally seen. That would have been my loss. I've thought about it quite a bit since I saw it in a theatre more than a month ago. I'm certain to see it again."
5,A passionate and erudite work.,"Mr Scott has demonstrated that the left and right have often distorted the African-Americans' humanity. This study serves to correct the position of Black folk and to return their humanity. Black folk are neither pathological as a group or helpless victims. Rather the African-American has faced discrimination and continues to face discrimination. Yet the solution to the African-Americans problems aren't exceptional, but rather are the result of years of discrimination. The African-American response has been admirable considering the discrimination we have faced. We have built our own institutions and thrived, irrespective of racism. Still a group with such baggage can go so far--so quickly. However, we deserve neither contempt nor pity--just a fair shake."
1,A Big Disappointment,"This author does a half... job at tearing down the accomplishments of social science - particularly sociology. He often fuses ideas of the individual (psychology) and the social reformers (I suppose he means sociologists). Moreover, while it appears that his sources are abundant his examinations at best are remedial. This work is the epitome of the kind of subjective methodology one can expect from scholars of history. I found his work to be completely bias and often times contradictory."
2,"Not bad, not great","There is a rawness in this recording that is refreshing, both in the playing, which seems to fall apart at times, and in the recording itself. There is also a humor in the approach--the name, the names taken by the bandmembers, the song titles. However, I was ultimately somewhat disappointed in this. After only a few listens, I didn't seem to be getting anything new out of it. I think a good record does that, giving repeated listens a value as you discover something new. But this album just left me flat after five or six listens."
3,Not so good,"If we are going to judge this record from the two precedent reviews, we are led to see it as a very good record. Because in general I appreciate the work of Heaven 17, great was my expectation. But I must admit that it was, in part, frustrated. The quality of the melodies isn't a strong point here - the most memorable melody is ""You've lost that lovin' feeling"". The instrumental part isn't also so much innovative and bold as we could expect - we can hear Gary Numan, Kraftwerk and even Devo echoing here and there. The following records of Heaven 17 would prove to be much more estimulating."
5,My daughter LOVES this book!!!!!,My 20 month old daughter absolutely LOVES this book!!! She has to have it read to her every night before going to bed. The message is wonderful & the illustrations are outstanding. Highly recommend it!
3,Where's Jesus?,"In Kathryn O'Brien's I'd Be Your Princess, a little girl imagines to be a princess and her father plays along and praises her for her Godly Character. With the exception of the first page, Bible verses are found on every page. There are eight verses from the New Testament and six are from the Old Testament. The colorful illustrations are outstanding. I like how the dad has dark hair, but the girl has blond hair. The people found in the drawings come from all walks of life - different professions, attire, ethnic backgrounds, etc. Unfortunately Jesus is never mentioned in this 2005 ECPA Gold Medallion Book Award Winner, and only one verse is from the Gospels. I find that quite disappointing so I emphasize to my girls (ages 5 and 8) that in order to be humble, loving, generous, and all the things the Bible states we should be, Jesus needs to be our Lord and Savior."
4,Fantastic message of Character!,"This discovery was a gold-mine! I work as a bookseller and when I found this original title illustrated by the wonderful Michael Garland, I knew it was a winner. I love the message of the story which will inspire ""princesses"" of all ages to be royal in their character! The girl's father responds to her with solid encouragement about her inner beauty throughout the book. I think many people are looking for books like this that are well done, but also are laden with the deep treasure only scripture can give. I have sold MANY copies of this book!"
4,A Great Book for Daddies and Daughters,"I bought this book for my husband and daughters to share together. I was very pleased with the constant affirmation the ""king"" gives the ""princess"". My daughters love playing princess and this is something they can relate to while helping to focus their thoughts on important character traits. It's a very sweet and possitive bedtime story."
3,Good Start,"After reading all the books in the Wallflower Series, I think this book is a good start to the series. The Devil in Winter, the 3rd book in the series, is by far the best, and in my opinion, the best Kleypas book, right next to Suddenly You.Secrets of a Summer Night is a good introduction to all the main characters of the following books. I like Anabelle and Simon. The epilogue hooked me into the book, but somewhere in the middle I didn't find it that interesting, with the exception of Lord Westcliff.It's a great start, but The Devil in Winter is infinitely the best!"
4,Solid romance - Excellent Tension,"The tension of their attraction steals the show in this novel.Classic romance scenario: Girl is snob who resists boy, boy can't resist girl and the two of course collide.Four young wallflowers band together in an attempt to find husbands one at a time...sure it is a clever idea for a group of romance novels but in this case the books are not only clever but a delightful read. Although a fine read on its own, this is book one in the series and I recommend you buy it when you are ready for a group of books to read in a row. Perfect for summer reading or long winter nights, buy at least the first four and enjoy. Are they the best romance novels in the world? No. Are they fun with a heavy dose of tension and more than a dash of steamy love scenes? Yes.A word about Lisa Kleypas - An author definitely worth reading if you are a fan of romance. Her love scenes tend to lean toward the steamy side but not into the realm of erotica."
4,Great Romance,"Wallflowers, Now to me that would have sucked. However, as this story moved on the wallflowers come to terms and try to make life happen and not just wait for it to happen.I really enjoyed this book. I love the way Lisa Kleypas put it together. It is not like any of the other story I have read base in this period. It was just not some thing for a high class to mix with the low class. Not all low class is low and when say low class has more coins then most high class; Why should he not be able to get the girl ~winks~ This store is for Romance lovers, it's a little spicy with the heat factor. It has up's and down and twists and turns that will make you wanting more.So Romance lover here is a book for you!"
2,Disappointment,This book had potential in the beginning but fell flat. I just couldn't connect with the characters and the author didn't write in the tradition of historical lettering and writing. I did finish it but it took me much longer for I kept falling asleep and losing my place. I wont be purchasing the others in the series.
3,It's okay,"This was an okay read. It just wasn't great. I was disappointed, there was no mystery, no excitement. Just a story about a country party and wealthy aristocrats."
5,I loved it,"I loved it as soon as I picked it up and started reading. Annabelle is a proud, strong-willed woman who wants to do best for her family but having a hard time since she has no dowry to speak of. She fights her attraction for Simon, whom she sees as a rake and not interested at all with marriage. So she tries her best to avoid him. Simon has a strong attraction towards her, yet doesn't want to go further than a mistress or lover with her, yet deep down has feelings for her that he doesn't want to admit to. There was some amusing things that occured, that Kleypas did a great job in creating. Well done!"
3,Annoying Start to Wallflowers Quartet,"Although I am glad to have been introduced to this new author (new to me), I found the pace slow in this start to the popular series. I had problems with the male and female leads in this book. They were flawed in a way that I was annoyed by and found it difficult to like them. She seems really insensitive and he wants to make her his whore until 3/4 through the book he reallizes he's in love and condesends to offer marriage. They become more likeable at the end of the book but by that point I was ready for a new read. I may not have moved onto the second in the series if I had not read so many good reviews. I'm glad I did as I enjoyed that book much more."
3,Average start to a perhaps okay series?,"I enjoyed this romance, but it was not great compared to Kelypas' previous works. It almost reads like a Dickens book with a required word count. The whole scene at the start with the brother at the exhibit could have been done in about a page. The meeting and agreement with the Wallflowers, and the amount of time they spend together plotting and scheming, took away from the romance between the hero and heroine.When they finally do marry, there is the wedding night and then.. nothing. No morning after, not much sense of them as a couple, and then we get the over the top ending.Even worse, there is way too much Lilian and Westcliff material in the book, which is setting up for the Autumn book in the series, but takes away from the romance in THIS book.This is an average start to what could be a good series."
3,Can't wait for the sequel,"The ""wallflowers"" concept is hardly new but Kleypas made it funny and unique somehow. With the exception of Evie, I thought all the girls were interesting and I look forward to reading about the American heiress getting involved with the prudish Earl of Westcliff. Although this book wasn't written as well as her past books, I still enjoyed the witty dialogue as well as the hero and heroine. I liked them both.The last part of the book was superfluous. Did not need to be there at all. Nothing happened. Obviously she didn't know how to end this book. Overall, a pretty good read."
5,The best of the best,"Let me put it this way: I have an 18-month old. Like most new-ish moms, I need my sleep. Desperately. That's why, when I started this book one night at 9pm, I thought I'd only read a chapter or two. Instead, I stayed up until 2am to finish it. It's that good. It's also not flashy. Kleypas doesn't rely on a lot of bells and whistles to tell her story. It's not particularly ""high concept."" What it is, is an intense, character-driven story that'll keep you turning pages long after you were supposed to go to sleep."
2,HEROINE AND NARRATOR BOTH ANNOYING--,"The narrator made the women in this story sound like a bunch of Hysterical Harpies while the ""heroine"" was so darn shallow and self-centered she was just about unbearable. Her ""genteel"" family was near financial ruin (a relative was selling her body to help pay the bills), yet she and her mother were only interested in her marriage to a wealthy peer even though a dashing wealthy man of trade had been interested in her for years. She couldn't possibly love the butcher's son so she along with her other cold-blooded wallflower friends set about to trap a not-too-bright titled man into a compromised wedding. Nothing romantic here. The only warmth came at the very end, but by then I could care less."
4,A Cute Tale!,"SECRETS OF A SUMMER NIGHT is a sweet tale of one of four young ladies looking for marriage and security. Annabelle Peyton's story is the first in a series of four novels detailing the desires of four young women seeking security and hopefully love during the early 1800's English marriage market.SECRETS OF A SUMMER NIGHT is well written, but not as sizzling as her novel, SUDDENLY YOU, but is well worth your time. Follow up with IT HAPPENED ONE AUTUM, DEVIL IN WINTER and soon-to-be-released SCANDAL IN SPRING. Ms. Kleypas never disappoints her readers!"
3,"Good, but not her best","It feels weird to give this isa Kleypas book 3 stars, because I usually love LIsa Kleypas. I guess I'm ranking Lisa Klepyas against Lisa Klepyas, which might not be fair -- she's set a tough stanard to live up to! But there was something a little limp about this story. It didn't seem to pick up any steam, and I kept expecting it to. And the heroine in particular seemed less developed than her usual heroines. I recommend it, simply because Klepas is such a fabulous writer, but it's not among her best."
3,An okay read,"I thought Annabelle was annoying. She was vain, bratty, snobby, and rude...all qualities a man looks for in a woman. Simon on the other hand qualifies in the category of STALKER. I mean he is constantly leering at her and of course falls in love with all of her aforementioned wonderful qualities. Even when she finally marries him it seems like she is all about the money. I gave this book three stars because I like Lillian throughout this story! At least she breathes life and humor into an otherwise okay read! She was the only reason I picked up the second story!"
4,You'll Love This!,This is my first time reading a book by Lisa Kleypas and it will not be the last. This book was really good. I finished it in 1 1/2 days. The characters were well developed and I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
4,"Not My Favorite, But Still Very Good!","I have read nearly all of Kleypas's novels, and alhtough this wasn't her best, in my opinion, it was still a very enjoyable read. I read it very quickly and the only problem I had with it was the heroine during the first part of the book. I just feel that she didn't match up to the quality of the heroine's in all of Lisa's other novels and that she was a tad mercenary. But, she improved as it went. I just LOVED Simon! He was so wonderfully naughty(I don't normally use terms like that). If only he were real(SIGH). This book did a good job of showing off Lisa Kleypas wonderful writing and storytelling abilities. I can't wait for the rest of the series."
2,Disappointed....,"I expected much more from this writter. Unfortunately this book was not her usual work. At times I was rather bored with all the details. There were moments when the transition from one paragraph to another was abrupt and confusing. This author always has created page-turner books, yet this one book was not written in that fashion. I believe that there was too much going on with the other characters as well as details about games...I find that this author's previous work has more to offer the reader. There is a certain style to her work that this book is lacking altogether. I hope her work in this book does not reflect her future work."
4,good series,"I always love Lisa's books, then stick with you for a while. I didn't enjoy it as much as the Hathaways girls but do like to reoccuring characters in her books."
3,terrible heroine wonderful hero,i have read thousands of books never have i hated a heroine with such passion she came across as the biggest snob ever detested the hero for two years for absolutely no particular reason thinks about money all the time and theres absolutely nastiness in her!the poor hero is just great i really dont see what drew him to her apart from the fact that she was attractive i have to agree with the duke his best friend on how he initially viewed her self absorbed and money hungry she tries to redeem herself right at the end but it was to little to late i couldnt help but weep for the hero throughout the book and would of given this book one star if it hadnt been for him
5,read it in The Bahamas,"I love all of the novels by this author. I ordered this for my Christmas present to me and it was worth it.Delice Lynch, Nassau"
3,Disappointing,"I am really a huge fan of Lisa Kleypas. I thoroughly enjoyed reading ""Again the Magic"" and I was eagerly awaiting LK's next book. However, this book was a huge letdown. I didn't understand how Simon could love Annabelle when he first saw her. It was just too unbelievable. The story did have some steamy scenes, but I didn't have a sense of the development of love between Simon and Annabelle like I did with Aline and McKenna in ""Again the Magic."" I wish she could have had more of a description of how Simon and Annabelle grew to love each other."
4,Enjoyable read,"I enjoyed the characters in this book. For some reason I really liked Simon, there was just something about him. I wished they had developed their relationship a little more vise filling up the end with intense sex scenes. But it was a good read and I can't wait to read more on the Wallflowers."
2,This one was a dud.,"Normally, I adore Lisa Kleypas novels, but this one was lackluster and ultimately not a satisfying romance. Neither the hero nor the heroine were all that likeable. The heroine seemed like a materialistic snob, and the hero came off as a horny cad. My advice is, skip ""Summer"" and go straight for the ""Autumn"" and ""Winter"" Wallflowers, they were both very good."
3,The Weakest of Wallflower series but...,"I'm glad Kleypas got the series started. The reviewer who found Annabelle shallow and snobbish and Simon poorly sketched (and too boorish for my taste) was right on the mark.The best thing by far in this story was the introduction to the Wallflowers, particularly the sparks flying between Marcus Earl of Westcliff and Lillian Bowman. I couldn't wait to read that story, which far surpasses this one in characterization, humor, wit, and romantic tension. Read It Happened One Autumn and Devil In Winter, and this one mostly to get to know the Wallflowers."
5,Great BOok,"I started this book, not expecting much, but was instantly captured. Over time I have become a huge fan of Lisa Kleypas, and this book didn't let me down. A great story and start to her newest series. Anabelle and her friends are a perfect group and a unique story line. I enjoyed every moment of this book and would highly recommend it. I find myself counting down the days till the sequel, It Happened of Autumn."
2,Not Kleypas' best,"I was really geared up for a new novel from Lisa Kleypas,a dn the idea of the Wallflower series was good. Unfortunately the execution so far isn't up to Kleypas' usual standard.Annabelle is a difficult heroine to like--she's a snob and somewhat unethical, willing to do almost anything to snare a rich husband. Simon is okay, but not the dreamy heroes Kleypas usually conjurs up.Kleypas is usually steamy, but the love scenes here seemed forced. Worse, the entire books is shallow, superficial, much like the heroine. It's slow and makes for a long read. A real disappointment. In fact, as I've written this review, I've lowered the rating. It's only 2 & 1/2 and comparing it to some many other, better works, I'm downgrading it from a 3 to a 2."
4,You cant put it down..,"While I will agree with most, its not like her other books...BUT....I will say for a fact, she hasn't lost her magic.I think this is a great beginning, and the rest of this series will get even better. The other girls in the series will have more depth, Annabelle was the one with the looks, so her story is not as deep. The American girls, will be hell on wheels, when their story comes out..I cant wait for the next book. I see Ms Kleypas reaching out.... and trying something new..and I say...you go girl...she never uses fluff ***Ever*** so she can take me with her anywhere..I love her writings....and all her books, including this one...were keepers..and read in one sitting. You just cant put her books down. They are ALL wonderful...Dont hurry and write the next one Ms Kleypas....but hurry OK *wink* You will always be on the top of my favorite authors list.*tips her hat*"
3,because Annabelle was such a witch!,"I really like Lisa Kleypas. I think she is a great writer and I have enjoyed her previous books. This book has been described in length so I will just say I don't like it because of Annabelle. I thought she was a witch. She was so hard and unappealing. I never warmed up to her and couldn't see why Simon wanted her so badly. She didn't do anything to merit his devotion until the very end and by then, it was too late for me. I had written her off. Like I said, I like LK's writing. She has written some of the most memorable heroes ever. I think she devoted too much of her time to developing Simon and should have spent a little time making Annabelle a little more likable."
4,Much better than her last!,"I've been an LK fan since book one but I was extremely disappointed with her last book. She's restored my faith with the story of wealthy but common Simon and poor but snobbish Annabelle. This book has an almost casual air to events. There are no dead bodies, no secret spies, just a woman desperate to secure her future and a man who begins to find himself desperate to provide it.Annabelle is on her last season in terms of money and age when she makes an impulsive choice to befriend her fellow wallflowers. Their friendship is instant and engaging. Annabelle enlists their aid on her search for a titled husband - ANY titled husband - while Simon hovers nearby. Meeting American heiresses and increasing her exposure to the upper level of the ton cause her to redefine what is important to her. While her mother will do literally anything to remain on the edges of society, Annabelle begins to toy with the idea of stepping outside it.This is a real romance and well worth the time."
4,Kept me up all night,"I stayed up til 3am reading this book, I wasn't worth a flip at work the next day, but I did truly enjoy the book. They have a fiery attraction that tickled me. I loved the fact that Hodgeham ""somewhat"" got what he deserved in the end. What a dillhole.I recommend this book. I have started reading the sequel and I am really excited about it as well."
3,Not great. Just ok.,"I had high hopes for this book in the beginning, but it kinda fizzled. It was ok as a start. I'm not sure that I didn't like Simon Hunt more than Annabelle- although she was described as perhaps the most beautiful of the Wallflowers. Not very impressed."
5,Excellent!,Loved every book of the wallflowers! Read all four books in about 7 days! Fantastic character development with all four of the girls!
4,An author you can always count on,Fun characters with a nice setup for future books. I enjoyed the concept of wall flowers taking charge of their destiny and the inclusion of characters that were in “trade“ as major characters
3,Not the best in the series....,"After having read ""It happened one autumn"" and ""Devil in winter"", I was anxious to read the first book of the series.Sadly I wasn't impressed.I enjoyed the story of how the ""Wallflowers"" were created but that was about it.I agree with other reviewers that the characters left a lot to be desired.Annabelle is not a heroine that one can like, too much of a self centered snob. She does get a bit better near the end...But by then I wasn't able to like her.Simon has potential but seems undeveloped.The characters and the story in the other two books are wonderful!!!! Too bad about these...."
4,"New Kleypas & ""romance"" fan","This was a first ""romance"" novel for me as I usually read other types of work and I ordered it thinking it was something else. Ok, ok, I even admit that I saw the embracing couple on the cover (a different one than now) and was embarrassed to be seen with it. BUT, at a recent hospital stay, I read it in less than 24 hours and really enjoyed it. It was a wonderful distraction. The characters are quite likeable and the love lust story very hot. AND, I can't wait to read the remaining books in ther series. I have been reminded not to judge a book by its cover."
2,Not one of her best...,I love Lisa Kleypas' books. This one was not one of her best. I hope the other books in this series will be better. I had trouble with the fortune-hunting heroin. Frankly I did not like her.
3,A Passerupper,"Love, love, love Lisa Kleypas. Think she's a great romance writer. Typically, I can relate to her characters. They are well developed, well thought out and their plots have a sense of realism. Not this time. The female character was a droll opportunist. I couldn't understand why the male lead wanted her so badly. I missed the spark between the two of them. The story of the friendship between the wallflowers is more interesting. It's the best part of the book and really only a few of the pages. Ok for escapist literature but, not worth the read."
4,Fixed Flat Panel Mount Review,"The product met my needs for mounting my television. It was easy to secure to the wall. The package included a template to help mark the wall for installation. You need some additional items like a level, a drill, etc. to help with securing it to the wall."
4,Defining single for Shayne Ward,This single is the best defining song for Shayne Ward. A must have. Great romantic sweet powerful ballad.
4,"Inside Gear is ""In to Stay""","This is the second pair of clothing I own by this manufacturer. The pants are comfortable to wear and roomy. Not really cool to wear on a hot day. There seems to be a double layer of nylon that traps your body heat in the air pockets, but hey who wants to wear pants on a hot day, right?"
2,durable but too hot,"Great price and these pants are very durable..... but the the lining causes them to be too hot for spring/summer hiking. While they are nylon, they are the ""shiny"" nylon which causing a swishing sound when you walk. I bought these for a summer scout hike. However, one trail run last weekend and I have now bought some much lighter weight pants instead. You get what you pay for with these."
1,Sweaty !!!,"I bought these pants thinking they would be great much like othere I have bought.....They are the hottest pants I have EVER had!!!Within 5 minutes my legs are soaked!Is it because they are nylon ??? Maybe ! But, think twice before you buy these !!!"
4,great product,"these bandages are good. especially when you need to track the healing process. they are easy to use. i got the 2 3/8x2 3/4"" but there are many other sizes"
5,Works at protecting my sensor,"This product fits nicely over my continuous glucose sensor protecting it for water while I shower, it doesn't irritate my skin or leave a sticky residue when removed."
2,Too much information in too little space,"I'm not faulting the research, which is comprehensive; it is the format that the author chooses to present this information that is so difficult to digest. On any given page there are as many as 15 different names with barely enough information about each artist to differentiate them from one another. The book is so short and so densely packed that it is difficult to absorb the information. The author uses the regionalization of the Blues as it traveled from the South to the North as his basis for examination; occasionally throwing in lyrics or musical notes to support a point, but their inclusion seems to be haphazard at best. If you are looking for a tremendous amount of information about the Blues this is fine, but if you are looking for an enjoyable read, look elswhere."
5,OK Amazing little thing,I got this and it is awsome only problem is the locking mech is cheap and i dont really care its a cool thing to have.
1,"Fast food TV, aka Bad.","Shows like this are what keep me from getting cable. TV shows are thrown together just like everything else nowadays. They slap them together, put on a snazzy title, and hope they get just enough ratings to warrant the next mediocre show.The first season was 'OK' enough for me to kind of want to watch the second season. I'm 5 episodes in and I'm done.Every episode has parts in it that make laugh at the poor production quality. It's boring, doesn't make sense, and I just don't care about any of the characters.This is the McDonald's extra value menu double-cheeseburger of TV shows. Enjoy."
1,no closed captions,This is my first time buying a HD amazon video (b/c I loved Walking Dead season 1 so much on Netflicks) but was sad to see that regular AND HD versions are un-captioned on amazon. I'd never have paid the $5 for these 2 shows had I known Amazon isn't as progressive as Netflicks for hearing impaired folks like me. Save your money for Netflicks when WD season 2 comes out if you need to read the mumblings.
5,Great series,If you just want the series without all the fluff this is the one for you. Best series out there right now!
1,Producers Getting Their Way,"Now Darabont's departure is clearly made evident. An entire episode devoted to, yet again, bedside manner and lost-girl searching with one... yes one zombie in a well in a pointless and gratuitous scene (""Let's give them suckers one zombie, but we'll make him over-the-top horrendous and give him an extra-grizzly death""). Horrible episode all around. This series really needs to pick things up instead of going static.At least the cop may finally be losing the hat, uniform and duty belt that he's inexplicably been wearing for 1.3 seasons. That was the only notable development... besides the brewing melodrama of an impending pregnancy with the soap operaesque intrigue involving questionable paternity. Ugh."
2,UGH!,"THE WALKING DEAD Season 1 was intriguing and well done. Season 2 is so MORALISTIC and full of childish domestic dramas. This is what happens when crappy writers are hired. The actors are really good, their dialogue is stupid. When you live in a world like this, you either learn how to survive and do your best to protect yourself or put a bullet in your head. The main cast characters parade around like they have the RIGHT to tell others how they're supposed to behave in a world filled with flesh-eating ZOMBIES. Give me a break. More people need to have sex in this series. Now there's some good therapy."
3,"Ok, for the ""Young and Restless Dead"" Soap Opera","Not 5 stars unless you lead a really boring life, or you are financially connected to the show. If this is 5 stars then the rating system must end at 10. Not the best and not the worst of the series, as it just ok.I think the show should be renamed. Here's some options: ""The Talking Dead"" ""Young and the Restless Dead"" ""General Dead Hospital"" [I mean really they have more surgeries taking place .... The patient list is higher than the zombie kill count. Sick girl in bed with unknown disease; Gunshot wounds; Torn ligaments from impalement. Car accidents victim due to sheer stupidity, so a brain concussion looks like she's ok as there was no brain to hurt. ]Can the women be any dumber!? They are illogical and irrational based on sheer emotion. Where's Ripley when you need her? ""Did IQ's suddenly drop since I've been away?""Let the zombies eat the writers and get some new ones. That would be a 5 star show."
2,They got to be kidding,"I like zombies and I like Dayle. I think he is the character I watch this show for and they are even trying to make him sappy. And the love triangle, you got to be kidding me. She asked him to stay. I swear that women is the dumbest person on the show. Really how long could she have thought her husband dead. He had on IV bag that may last about a day or two at most depending on how slow the drip was, than the body can only last a week with out water. I guess the lesson is that if you think you love one is dead and zombies walk the earth wait more than a week to sleep with their best friend."
4,Half way through...,So far it's great...loved the first season and this one seems slightly (???) less gruesome and more character driven. We are enjoying thus far...
5,Amazing!,I started watching this show at the beginning of Season 3. I was excited to be able to catch up!
5,I missed the finale ;( it was never replayed... thank god for amazon,The finale was only played once for all i know. since the show is on monday nights from 9 to 10pm i had to go to bed due to school. I was left wondering what would happen at the end of season 2. This is my favorite show and i could not resist spending 3$ to watch it. It is a little blurry and pauses. ( My computer is not slow) but i just wanted to see what happened. CANT WAIT TILL FALL 2012 FOR SEASON 3!!!
3,Fails to even compare with season one,"*No Spoilers*Although season one of this series was fantastic, season two brings a good first episode, but it's a slow decline from there. The occasional suspenseful scene will appear, but for me, there was too much standing around talking and arguing in an illogical manner. It takes approximately 3 episodes to accomplish each task. Season just seems to move incredibly slow. Hopefully the pickup of the season next year brings the show...back from the dead."
2,I'm Starting to Lose Faith,"After Season 1, I had high hopes for this season. Unfortunately, those have been dashed after the writers decided to have the cast settle into little house on the prairie so that they can all work out their emotions.This season is floundering, and why did they think that basing the entire season around finding a single lost girl would be a good thing? Okay, we get it, you still think she has a chance. Unfortunately I don't think I can say the same thing about me coming back if there's a season 3."
2,"Days of Our Lives, with Zombies?","Each episode in season 2 seems to follow a template:- 5 minute intro teasing the viewer into thinking something interesting is finally going to happen,- 30 minutes of endless soliloquy, ineffectual shouting matches, and baby daddy drama,- 10 minute climax in which something at least mildly interesting happens, giving the viewer hope that the next episode might be worth watching without the fast forward button.I'm ready for the gang to get back on the road and advance the story. Sadly, AMC's listings for the rest of the season indicate [*slight spoiler*] they won't be leaving the boring old farm for the foreseeable future. I'll give the rest of the season a miss and wait to see if season 3 - should one be forthcoming - can bring back some of what made season 1 so gripping."
2,streaming problems,I guess i read it wrong and the husband was unhappy i didnt buy him the dvds. Love the show just hated having problems streaming!
4,Second time around,"would have went a 5 star rating but not when you half to order a second order when the first should be A1 ,Just like food it should be A1 when I order the first time should never half to reorder looks bad on a company"
4,Much better than season 1,"I guess I was one of the few that thought season 1 was pretty lame. Atrocious dialogue, boring and awkward characters, and not much excitement. Furthermore, I thought each episode of Season 1 was worse than the previous one.So my expectations were low for this Season, but my wife wanted to watch it and others kept telling me how good the show was. I agree - this season the characters seemed to find themselves and have some personality, the writing and dialogue become sharper, and the overall story line was compelling. I bet they got some new writers in, because it is truly a better crafted show than it was during Season 1."
5,A must after season one,Love the genre. We had to have this after also purchasing Season One and we'll buy Season Three when it is released.
5,Gift,"Okay, this was a gift for my son. We do watch the series even though I took a strong dislike to some of the characters and wish they'd decide whether zombies can or can't open doors, pry things open or flap at them, run or drunkenly reel around. Let's face it, when all that's working in your skull for ""thinking"" is your brain stem, you're essentially walking piece of rotting meat, not Einstein. The special effects are great, and this case looks just as ucky as the guy that Andrea stuck with the screwdriver, and I'm waiting for the next season to start."
5,the best show on tv and dvd,I love it its very addictive once you start its on. Can't wait for season 3 what's going to happen next.
5,Love The Walking Dead!,"Must say that I'm hoping all but maybe 2 of the characters survive the zombie apocalypse! I love Glenn and Daryl and hope they make it to the end of the show- the rest, I could care less about."
5,Great balance,"This show is a great balance between action, story, sex, and suspense. I usually don't allow myself to get sucked into shows that you have to watch all the episodes to understand but let me tell you this one is AMAZING.... There are constant twisting plots, friction between characters and character personality changes you would never expect. Overall I rate it 5 stars. Not for the well done zombie outfits or gore but because this show will keep you coming back for more. Very well done."
3,second season slow BUT...,walking dead second season is slow but necessary . i've read other comments and they are okay and on point about it being slow also. However zombie shows have unlimited potential. walking dead atlanta meets walking dead chicago or wisconsin..hell ving rhames could show up from dawn of the dead and it'll add to the thrill of the show. im still amazed how resident evil and underworld are going on 5 and 6 sequels apiece almost like starwars. underworld is reaching next generation with the hybrid child i mean it will keep selling and people will keep watching. i should get paid for my walking dead city to city idea but its cool cuz its more ideas in my head..maybe unthought of yet. the more universal things get the more potential..don't add vampires to the show please. but u get my point. i can't get into how much money they have to budget and use for the show. I'm not into all that i'm just saying i'm looking forward to season 3.
1,"walking down hill , very very slowly","What started life as a good reasonably paced survival/Zombie series has sadly devolved into a ""relationships"" and personal crisis drama with Zombies as a cover story.each episode features less and less compelling plots, she wants to die, he did something bad and oh I am preggers.endless moral debate that borders on inane. ""gun control"" dragged into world where zombies are eating people alive, really?There would be no question of ever not carrying your gun.each week after another the Walking Dead goes further down the path of a thinly disguised personal drama about relationships, feeling and such like, then scattered through the 45 mins are a few token zombies.The show has been watered down so far I cant tell if its coffee or tea."
3,Season 2 Walking Dead,"I think Season 2 wasn't quite as good as Season 1 was. I don't think it was as action packed as Season 1 and one episode in particular seemed to have a repeating scene in it, which I found a little odd. Hopefully Season 3 will bring back more of the action!"
2,Season 1 = Awsome / Season 2 = not so much,"I must admit that season 1 was without doubt one of my all time favorite shows. However season 2 has left me feeling like I could care less if the show returns for season 3. I have tried to like it but the lack of action, especially in the middle of the season, has turned the show into a soap opera ""drama fest"". Also, the shows less than stellar writing has me disliking more than half of the characters."
5,Love it.,"I love the comics, and i cant believe how amazing this show turned out. I cant wait to have my second season and the new comic issues. =]"
3,"More like 3.5 for what has become too much soap opera, too little apocalypse","Season one is taut, mean, rough, uncompromising. Season two, well, isn't. There are moments (I won't reveal here) of greatness, but they are too few and far between. I like Season two, but I don't love it. I'm behind; Season three is DVR'd, so I'll have to wait and see. Last thing I want is another Lost - a once great show that became a silly sex romp and then went back to something worth watching."
3,Again Best Series Ever,According to recipient there seems to be a portion that is missing or won't play on the disc. I am giving it a three because it was still received quickly and was in good condition. I have asked recipient to please retry and if there is still a problem to please give it back to me so I can handle further if necessary.
3,Got a little soapy,"I didn't think Season 2 was as good as Season 1. Halfway through, Season 3 seems to be back on track."
3,People are stupid!,"OK, I do absolutely LOVE this show; however, I'm less than entranced by the stupidity these folks exhibit! The whole thing with Sophia going MIA and Rick's instructions to her about what to do... and Lori? DUH, lady! She deserves to be eaten, for as horrible a mom as she is! Andrea wasn't the brightest bulb in the box, either. I just wanted to smack more than 1/2 these people!!! It was sad. :("
2,Worst of the series in my opinion,"I love this series but bloodletting didn't have much of the walking corpses in this episode which was a bummer. The other episodes from the first season was amazing, and the other two I have seen in this season is good but Bloodletting was a let down for me. The first season seems to be much better than the second, but hopefully it will turn out alright."
1,"Great Show, Lame Bluray","This review doesn't reflect the quality of the show, simply the bluray/dvd itself. When season 1 was released I bought it immediately, only to find a few months later that a better more fleshed out bluray/dvd was released. This appears to be happening again. I just want AMC and whoever else is in charge of these stripped down releases to STOP doing this. You aren't doing yourself any favors by alienating and infuriating your core audience with sub par format releases. I will not buy this version and neither should you. Instead, wait for the better release that will come a few months after this one. It will show these studios that we aren't stupid and we want the best product they can give us, not this half-way product."
1,Don't waste your money or time,"Judge, Jury, Executioner I was hoping that the title was in reference to the failed show. It has been judged to suck. The jury is out it sucks, and was hoping this was it's last show to be executed. All the characters are terrible, and the voice of reason and humanity dies of course. Show was probably made by morally bankrupt liberals. One zombie for the whole issue!? Come on! I watch the show now only to see their demize, I hope Shane is dismembered and served up as a burrito. Used to like Rick who seemed like he was a principled conservative, but now he is a liberal void of ethics. This series was so bad it was probably written by a walker who works at Amazon."
1,"Awesome Series, sick case.... But",The collector's edition is effen awesome but I'm screwed out of it cause I don't have a blu-ray player :/ which is a shame cause I'm a huge fan and totally would of bought the dvd collectors version if there was one.
4,"I'm outta here. . . oh, now I'm back.","Sure, there are some zombies and gore, and some drama, but the drama should flesh out the action, not the other way around. See Rick running on the image of this Season? Run, Rick, Run! That's what should have happened from episode 2 or 3 . . . RUN AWAY!!! Rig up some ""Trollhunter"" quality vehicles, make like a baby, and head out!UPDATE AFTER FINAL EPISODE OF THIS SEASON: Okay, they've nearly redeemed themselves. A couple details I overheard at work lead me to finish the season, and turns out it ain't quite so bad. But if they end up staying put only one hour away from the farm for the entirety of Season 3, I'll have to take away a star. Just sayin's, all. They still need some Trollhunter trucks, though."
5,Awesome,"Best show ever, great to be able to stream on amazon and watch anytime.Will buy every season, favorite series, warch every episode"
5,Great Episode - Not Slow At All,"This was a great episode. Several folks have described it as ""slow,"" but I disagree. Rather than focusing on gore and fighting, this week, the writers worked on character development. We were able to learn a lot about the fears and vulnerability of several of the characters. We were able to see how they experience -- or try to suppress -- the stress of their situation. This is important stuff. There's plenty of time for shooting zombies in the head. I find the conversational side far more interesting."
2,One Side-Track After Another,"Doesn't go anywhere. One boring side-track after another. The characters are not that interesting. They sit in one situation per episode. No progress. Plenty of military weapons laying around, M2 .50 caliber machine guns, tanks ( why not start one up and use it? )etc... and they do not gather them. They keep themselves meagerly armed despite many opportunities to upscale their protection. Someone needs to pick up one of those M2 machine guns a mow down a heard of walkers. Then it would be more interesting. Budget issues? Poorly done."
4,STILL GOING STRONG,"Impressive portrayal of human reactions after a major disaster. Strong writing, persuasive acting, admirable attention to detail, no loose ends, suspense sustained without gimmicks. Congratulations to all parties concerned."
4,I like it,Got it for a great price during Black Friday weekend plus its a great show. Could not pass up the deal.
3,"I'm still liking it, but...","I have to reluctantly rate this season at three stars, even though overall the series rates four. I'd go 3 1/2 if I could. The first season successfully captured the feel of a global apocalypse. The first half of the second season had a reasonable number of roller-coaster peaks and valleys, capped off by the Barnyard Massacre. The second half, sorry to say, is falling a little short for me. There's a little too much storytelling through dialog, the interior sequences are for the most part kinda boring, and zombies seem more like a nuisance than a global threat.There is clearly a cut in the production budget. It shows. AMC used to be the go-to network for quality original series. They're on the verge of losing that, and it's the fault of the network bean counters who think viewers are too stupid to notice the corner-cutting."
2,Lets move on,These guys can't quite get out of Atlanta. Seems like the same episode again and again. Move on to something more interesting.
4,Zombies...,"This series just rocks, even if your not into zombies the human story is well worth watching,Was VERY disapointed that The Talking Dead was not included in the special features, to see the talking dead after every episode you have to log in to Youtube do a search for Talking dead and it should lead you to the AMC talking dead episodes.its a big inconvenience but if you love this show and have to see all the extra's im sure you will do this lol.So 4 out of 5 because the Talking dead is not on the disk."
1,Season 2 Is Terrible,"If you thought season 1 was ok, season 2 is trash. It has quickly become a soap opera loosely set in a post-apocalyptic zombie-infested world. The characters and their drab relationship dramas take center-stage, with occasional zombie attacks. Who the hell would have time for silly relationship issues in a world full of zombies trying to eat your flesh? It's also full of plain stupid writing. The zombies are attracted to sound, this was established in season 1, yet the survivors drive around with a Harley Davidson, and waste bullets shooting cans for some sport target practice."
5,great show,"This show is so great because it is about the way the cast lives their lives around the zombies, not just about the zombies..Can't wait for october 14 on AMC."
4,Drags a bit,I love this show but Season 2 dragged a little bit. The new characters are interesting in their own way but with the whole group staying in one place for so long it really needed some more action.
5,Love it!,Was everything I expected and more! Almost full sized head and sooo cool looking! Awesome details! Hope they come out with more for the other seasons
5,Amazing,One of the best shows on TV right now. If you like zombie movies you will love this show and season 3 is just getting better.
5,Love the show!,"I'm surprised how much I enjoyed this show, zombie media has become quite a monster, lots of terrible entertainment out there. Great writing, acting and effects, I do wonder who's cutting their hair all the time... and the lawns..."
5,TV doesn't get better than Walking Dead,This Blu-ray is testament as to why I don't subscribe to pay television. I read the reviews and then I wait for it to come onto Blu-ray. I did the same with Homeland. This way I choose what I watch and when and pay only for those programs. To hell with pay television. Blu-ray and DVD frees me from all that crap. Great show and great Bluray set.
5,Gotta love it!!,I bought it for my girlfriend and ended up making it my favorite show. Cant wait for season 3! Im on my way to halloween horror night right now
5,Walking Far Ahead,"This season started off a bit slowish (though still intriguing), but culminated with a bang and left me hanging on with anticipation for Season 3. The dynamics of the group has changed, the threat of the walkers has been heightened, and secrets have been revealed. I look forward to the producers and directors development of the characters as well as the new landscape our little band of survivors will encounter next!"
5,Awesome!,"This is such a great show to watch and you just can't wait until the next episode. It's really great if you love scary entertainment, Zombie action, and a good plot. I absolutely love this series."
3,Getting a little melodramtic,"I loved the first season! but this second season is focusing to much on ""relationships"". While this has a little interest it shouldn't be the main focus on the series. Hell it's called the walking dead not ""general hospital of the dead"". Ending was stellar, i just hope they focus more on the cast surviving the dead then there relationships with each other."
1,Not as advertised!,"I'm a huge Walking Dead fan....HUGE!This Zombie head was very dissapointing. It looks NOTHING like the photo...the photo of what I thought I was going to get must be the actual model done professionally. Then they mass produced something that is along those lines, but nothing like it. Beware. It's a different color and a much worse version of the Zombie head in the photo."
1,"The Ending Made It OK, But the Rest is DRY DRY DRY ....","With an economy this bad you'd think they'd have the better writers, but NOOoooo. They are cheating the fans with dry episodes having ONE and only one thing in each episode that makes it worth watching. What a rip-off. I love zombies and this is NOT ABOUT A ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE any more, it's a soap opera where they throw in a few zombies to keep the title. I am not sure I will continue to watch. Yes, I can write better episodes which leads me to believe the professional writers are not so talented. I won't be wasting my $2 an episode."
2,WTF?! Missing scenes.,"I saw this episode on AMC last night and enjoyed it thoroughly. I was very disappointed however, to find out that there were quite a few minutes missing from the Amazon version I paid for. Where's the scene where Daryl and Glen inspect ""Zombie Randal"" and find out he was not bitten? And what else have I been missing in these abridged episodes Amazon is selling? I want my money back!"
1,A Dull Soap Opera,"I didn't imagine it possible, but AMC has turned a post apocalyptic zombie thriller into a boring soap opera. The silly interpersonal relationship issues are just ridiculous, and drag on, and on. With very sparse sprinkles of zombie action, this show has become a dud."
2,"Love Series, Good Quality","Four DVDs in a box with a brochure-ish thingy and a coupon.. DVDs are good. Cannot wait to see the next season. I wonder if the virus is reversible and how much longer Glenn's gonna be alive. If he's dead, I'd stop watching. LOL"
2,walking dead season 2,"I was a huge fan of season 1 of the walking dead and bought the blu ray when it came out,best $20 I've ever spent. I've watched the first season at least 20 times and it never gets old,just a really well done show.Season 2 however is....Ehhh there were like 4 episodes that were decent but totally not worth the $70 price tag that they want here. The main Character Rick slowly became a mega DBag and completely unlikeable,they did nothing the whole season but sit on a farm Talking and occasionally killing a zombie or two....Boring! Like I said,there were about 4 episodes that were actually good but 4 good episodes is far from season saving.Bottom line is save your money and just buy the regular season 2 blu or DVD,this season is FAR from worth it."
5,Great Series,I love this series and this is the first TV series I have purchased from Amazon. I was happy that I could download episodes on my iPad to watch while I travel.
3,wrong disc in set,"I orded the complete set of season 2 we received 4 disc, 2 of disc 3, and missing episode #13 by the dying fire, ??? make it right amazon. do not want to send back all for just one episode."
2,poor acting/poor theme,Just watched the first episode of season 2 and just like season 1 this show seems to be pretty boring as far as plot and acting go. The ending to the first episode was probably the dumbest 2 minutes I have ever watched on TV. Why on god's blue earth would the two men just let the boy walk towards the deer? Why? Why would that happen in reality? And then the boy gets shot by another hunter! You have to be kidding me. This will be the last I watch of this series.
3,Disappointed,"The first season was so good I figured that I'd watch the second... very disappointed though. Barely anyone dies anymore and the plot is turning mainstream, come on people, it's a ZOMBIE series... it's almost campy at times. It's not bad, but there are MUCH better shows out there. Hopefully they kick it up a notch for the second half of the season, or else I'm totally writing this one off."
3,Not near as good as season 1,"Ok to watch, but not near as good as season 1. People don't behave in normal ways. Why dont they start building fences and safe zones? The ""walkers"" are so stupid that it would be easy to hold up in a safe place and build a community. Instead, they camp out in the middle of nowhere, walk around and pretty much do nothing. Also, the budget must have been cut way down, as there are few apocalyptic scenes, not near as many zombie extras, and almost no action, just a lot of talking. Lame. I'll stick with Breaking Bad."
1,Quality Fell Off Of a Cliff,"If you are looking for an original, exciting, well made and well acted horror show to spend your time and money on, don't just run away from Season 2, FLEE as if a hoard of ravenous zombies was 3 feet behind you and just seconds from sinking their foul, rotten teeth into the soft flesh of your backside. On the other hand, if you're an insomniac, and are looking for a cure, something that will lull you right to sleep, then this is just what you've been searching for. Remember those low budget, made for video or TV, horror movies that either bored you to death or were so silly that they made you laugh instead of scream? Yes indeed, the season 2 writers must have dug up a bunch of them and used them as blueprints for this show. Seriously, terrible is far too soft a description. My family has been waiting over a year for season 2 to come out on Netflix, and now we are disappointed enough to almost cry. Just skip it."
1,"Don't Bother, It's Just Dead","This show isn't even walking anymore. I didn't imagine it possible, but AMC has turned a post apocalyptic zombie thriller into a boring soap opera. The silly interpersonal relationship issues are just ridiculous, and drag on, and on. With very sparse sprinkles of zombie action, this show has become a dud."
3,Bit of a let down,"I was looking forward to this season premier as the first season was very good albeit too short. Unfortunately they chose to open the season with a standard cliché plot. That is, the scared kid running off, refusing to follow directions, hiding and forcing everyone else to risk their life searching for the one person they can't bear to leave behind. This cliché has been used in nearly every action TV show that has children involved. Lassie, Flipper, Lost in Space, Battlestar Galactica (the original), to name a few. There were a lot of different ways they could have taken this show. I was hoping the writers, having had such a long break, would be more original. Hopefully the rest of the season will be better."
2,Disintegration of any value,"What is crazy is both the way this show has simply gone no where since the beginning of the season, and how much the positive reviewers ignore the obvious bad writing, bad acting and silly repetitious plotting. It's like General Hospital with the addition of a weekly zombie or 2, where no one speaks like humans, they just stage whisper because Hollywood thinks that shows powerful emotion. I'm sorry, this show has just gotten embarrassing. At least they finally followed the books and killed off the main cause of the redundancy, the Shane character. It's about a season and a half too late, but progress is progress."
3,Meh.. what's with Glenn?,"Yeah. Last ep. preceding Cherokee Rose was much better ( love what they did with Shane's character in that one!) And he dressed up in Otis's clothes- which is thoroughly creepy all by itself. However, this ep manages to insert at least one highly ridiculous and moronic plot point involving Glenn. Is there any ""plan"" this kid won't acquiesce to? My respect for his character almost dropped down to the well bottom with him, and no juvenile and gratuitous sex scene was going to undo the damage. A selfless risk-taker? Ok. A stupid selfless risk-taker? C'mon.But more importantly than all the rest lies this burning question: Will Daryl ever bathe?"
5,Great series!,Hooked since the first episode of season one and not disappointed with the second season! Full of surprises and twists!
5,Walking Dead Season 2,"Love the series, I was kind of hesitant at first since this was after all a show about zombies, but I was pleasantly surprised!! It is a really good show I HIGHLY recommend it!!!! :)"
3,Great Episode - Bad Price,I *love* Walking Dead but will never again pay this much for a single episode. I canceled my cable and this is the only show that I am unable to find online to watch (I have Netflix and Hulu).AMC deserves a slap on the wrists for their inability to put their shows on their site. This is one watcher who will be waiting until it comes to Netflix next season.
1,Will bore you to death.,"This show has gone from bad to worse with the second season. They should simply remove the zombies, they never get more than 2 minutes in the series. I expected to see more zombies than endless chatter. This series is just filled endless talking and crying. Lots of grown men crying constantly. Need a downer for the week?... just watch an episode. I do not plan on paying to hear people just chat on and on about their issues and no one is being proactive in establishing anything for themselves. Why can't they go find there own house to live in. The have the whole US to pick a house at this point.To summarize my review..... the opposite of crack writing!"
1,Oh SO Boring!,"I too, like many of the other reviewers, have been disappointed in season 2, it has gotten so boring. I find myself fast forwarding thru all the dialogue. What happened to the zombies, it is called ""The Walking Dead"" right? Get the heck away from the farm and the pregnant women, what is with that? A baby crying and attracting zombies with all the noise?? Really???"
5,Zombies!,"One of the best if not THE best of the ""Zombie Apocalypse"" genre. Empathetic and varied characters, well written and cast. NOT for children under 12."
4,If you watched it on tv,Awesome. Better without commercial .so glad the series is continuing and a great way to spend time while waiting for the next season.
5,Walking Dead,"I love The Walking Dead, so of course I am going to love this product! I honestly don't have a Blu-ray DVD player yet, but in the next month I am getting one! And I can't wait to watch Season Two again, yet I can since I've already seen each episode at least once or twice and plus, season 3 is coming soon! I can't wait for the 3 season of The Walking Dead to come on, Sunday October 14th, 2012 of course on AMC at 9 p.m.I really like the cover for the Season Two DVDs and the zombie head is AWESOME!"
3,Eh,I had higher hopes for this series because I have heard many people rave about it but I haven't been impressed so far.
5,Love!,The walking dead is by far my favorite show on television right now. I don't have AMC so I use Amazon. Works great for me to rewatch.
3,Good but.....,I am hooked on this series but staying at the farm gets dragged out a little too long for my taste.
5,Mmm!!! Mmm!!! Mmm!!!,"Love, love, looooooooove Walking Dead!!! Leaves me breathless every time I put on this show!!! Too bad my fave character didn't last too long :(("
2,Series is Slipping,"Season One was great, particularly early on. Season Two (4 episodes in) is a big come-down. Not enough action, too much talking. Every episode there are around three scenes in which characters have a long, tedious heart-to-heart about their relationship and it kills any narrative momentum. Take a tip from the zombies--stop freaking talking! If it weren't for Crossbow, there wouldn't be anyone (alive) left to like."
5,Great,Juat as described and have watched it more than once. The part with Sofia coming from barn the best and sad part of the season
5,One of the Best Shows on TV.,"If you haven't seen TWD, do yourself a favor and watch it now! Ground breaking in execution and will leave you wanting more!"
4,Good Quality But...,Quality was great until it froze within a minute after streaming this through my Roku 2 XS device.I had to cancle out and resume the video again. Other than that there wasn't a problem at all.
5,Best Series on Tv PERIOD,"Zombies, Guns, Gore, Best Tv series on AMC who cares about that Breaking.... whatever show on AMCcant wait for season 3"
3,This WAS my favorite show EVER!,"Seriously? I've read all the reviews up till now & I don't feel the need to say what others are pointing out, but its true! The show is dragging, Lori is a horrible person & I wish she would get eaten (maybe a zombie baby thing would be a nice change), Andrea is anoying, Rick & Shane are morons and the rest of the cast is just thrown in as filler...re-using old plots (already?! REALLY?)and cutting out most of the characters to add in a pointless zombie scene...grrr, its just getting WORSE! Please, someone find the writer from the first season & HIRE HIM BACK at twice the sallery as before, thats the only thing that will save this show!!!"
3,Zombie Soap Opera,"I agree with Jhette, I watched all the first season episodes to be able to figure out the plots. It almost wears you out in some of the scenes and drags through very soap-like scenes. The best place to hide from a zombie is a cemetary-- they're all dying to get out! The show needs to inject some dark humor. I was left feeling depressed."
2,Barely watchable,"This show has become a slow & uninteresting soap opera. In a post apocalyptic world we're still supposed to care about stupid relationship issues in episode 5? Not only this, but zombies are attracted to noise, the characters are aware of this, yet they drive around with a Harley, waste bullets shooting at can targets, and I just can't stand the level of stupidity put forth by the writers."
2,disappointing,"The first season was amazing, and this season is like a Lifetime movie of the week, except it has zombies in it. Stupid, repetitive plot; idiotic dialogue; not a shred of irony or wit; and fraught with gender and racial stereotypes. Too bad!!"
5,Can't stop watching!,"I really love this show! It is filled with suspense and drama, you never know what's going to happen next and the zombies look so real."
5,This is not democracy anymore!!!,"Rick wants to keep group together because thats the key to survive and the words summed up everything ""This is not democracy anymore"". Most shocking moment for me was Lori's reaction when Rick told her that he killed Shane, I was expecting supportive actions but she was so pissed, b***h!!! she loved Shane from the start!! anyways it was a great ending for Season 2, Cant wait for the Season 3"
2,Starting to root for the zombies to win...,"I gotta say at first I just wanted Lori to die via the zombies, now we can throw Carl in there too. Every time there is a scene with either one of them I keep hoping they get chomped-on and done away with.Please, time to get off the damn farm. The writing is getting worse and NOTHING IS HAPPENING. I don't agree with killing Dale - I feel it hurt the story more than helped it."
1,Become A Soap Opera,"I didn't imagine it possible, but AMC has turned a post apocalyptic zombie thriller into a boring soap opera. The silly interpersonal relationship issues are just ridiculous, and drag on, and on. With very sparse sprinkles of zombie action, this show has become a dud. There are just too many unbelievable nonsense fillers, like riding loud Harley Davidsons, and wasting bullets shooting cans. I can't watch this anymore."
1,Disappointing and slow and where are the zombies!,"The first season rocked and the second season sucks! I bought the second season on Amazon but have lost interest due to the lack of zombie presence. The second season does not have the raw grit, and attraction that the first season had that kept me staying up late to watch. I hope the producers fix this soon before I just give up on the walking dead completely. This show is more like a slow soap opera on a farm than a zombie movie classic that it was on track to become."
5,Finally !,"After Nip Tuck & the Shield I didn't think there would be another series to peak my interest. Each episode is like a theatrical production. Great effects and excellent acting. I cant believe we have to wait until Fall for another episode. My wife and I watched the first season in three nights after we stumbled on the series. That is considerable since we never have time to watch TV. If you're not sold, just watch the first episode and you will be hooked. Guaranteed"
5,Walking Dead,Must see... My wife told me to buy season one when we watched it we couldnt stop... It will keep you bitting your nails and covering your eyes but peeking and saying watch your back there right behind you... run run run... watch it you will love it
5,Walking Dead fans must have,"If you like the show, then you should add this to your DVD collection. Wait till it goes on sale and scoop it up."
5,Best Show Ever,"We love the Walking Dead! Characters, writing, story lines, special effects.The creators of this show are geniuses. Buy it."
5,Love The Walking Dead!!,"Love every season of The Walking Dead!Even though the Limited Ed was pricey, love the zombie head-so I can't complain.Can't wait for Season 3 to be available on DVD or Bluray & hoping that a combined pack will be available.The special effects are just awesome, AMC is really doing some amazing stuff."
2,Better mailing,Need to ship product better. I got it in the mail and the corners of the cardboard sleeve and left over glue were a priceTag had been. I'm not thrilled with the conditioner. Exspecially co sidering this is to be a christmas gift
2,SNORE,"Season 1 of this show was beautiful. Every episode, my stomach was knotted up with the question, ""Who is going to get eaten?"" Nowhere was truly safe, even the camp was eventually overrun, and people died. It was frightening and I couldn't stop watching.Season 2 is a snoozefest focused on character development and emotional drama. ""Im pregnant dont tell"" ""You told"" ""I love you"" ""I slept with Shane"" ""You had me at hello."" Blah blah blah. I care less and less about these characters. We are six episodes in and I dislike them all more with each passing episode. Without the 'survival tension', the show is just really a soap opera with zombies at the backdrop. Im secretly hoping the walkers escape from the barn, and kill everyone, except for Daryl, he's good peeps."
5,"Look, folks","Season One was the ""Back Story"" - giving the background, so to speak. Now? We enter into the real deal - the current events in Season Two, the characters having been ""fleshed out,"" and the good stuff coming to fore. This stands to be another version of the ""X Files"" as far as longevity...and most definitely, quality Television Series."
4,Now for the waiting....,This episode was so great only because its the last one we get till Fed 12th 2012! Hurry up & wait...I hope the next half isn't as slow as this season has been so far! I say bring back the idea guy from the first season (who was fired) and get this show back on track!
4,Liked it!,"It's not for all. I'm not really into this type of movies, but the story is exciting. I won't recommend this for anyone with a weak stomach."
5,excellent,The Walking Dead is always entertaining and character driven. Avoid if you don't enjoy television gore. Each episode offers a satisfying story arc.
1,Thankfully there are no zombies because these people have low IQs.,"Just OK and I am being generous. No need to check towns or stores anymore before deeming them safe. No need to take precautions of the most basic kind (see ending). No need for guns. This group would have been dead in a real war. Until the writing gets better this is my LAST episode. Get better writers!!!*** Update 11.9.11***I think the new writers are giving this show 5 stars, so I have lowered my rating to compensate. This season blows!!! Folks, save your money."
3,Rick grows a pair,"Finally, they have Rick grow a pair and put someone down. I'm starting to like him again. Shane blows and Dale whines a little too much. Didn't care much for the pregnancy. I want a little more external conflict like the ending here. I'm gonna keep watching now. I was close to giving it up."
5,A good watch,"This episode specifically, like one other reviewer posted, is definitely in the top 3 of the series. I despise the director for these unbearable cliff hangers, but each installment always delivers, so it's worth the suspense in the end. This is definitely one series worth watching. It's come at the perfect time to tap into the rising zombie fad as well. The best part about the show is that the zombie apocalypse is only the setting, not the story in and of itself. Good character development and suspense put this one, in my opinion, just a notch above Romero (be gentle)."
5,love this series,"Spent the Christmas break catching up on the series. Can not wait for season 3 to resume. The disk were in great shape, no skipping like I sometimes get when purchasing seasons on sale."
3,MISS FIRED PRODUCER,"I am a big fan of this show, but the quality of the episodes has dropped off since they fired season one producer. Hope it gets better"
2,"Good price, poor quality","We purchased this season on DVD not realizing that we were getting second quality product. The discs skip and freeze. So far we have been able to stop, go back and fast forward through the bad parts. Hopefully there will be nothing worse."
5,Good stuff.,"Good series. Season 2 was a little slow, but I still give it five stars. If you don't watch walking dead, you should.. or don't.. I don't care."
3,Lots Of Standing Around and Talking,"I agree somewhat with the criticism that there is a lot of nothing much in the first half of Season 2 of The Walking Dead. My real gripe is that what they are saying is not helping to develop these characters into people that you care about or really NOT care about, which is important if this show is going to last. However, the zombie action is still gripping (and icky)."
3,Where's Aretha Franklin?,The credits for episode 10 say that Aretha Franklin is starring. I could not spot her anywhere! Did anybody else see her? Was she playing one of the zombies? Was she pictured on a passing billboard as the characters were driving down the road? Help us out here...
2,This is how shows get canceled,"I spent over an hour typing an extensive review of this Season, and then I realized, I could summarize it in one sentence.Yet another heartpouring people drama. -1"
5,Great series,"In my opinion The walking dead is one of the best series in years!So, of course, I had to get it on DVD. Unfortunately there is no uncut version in Germany or even the UK.So for any fan in Europe, of course you need a Region 1 DVD player:I ordered it from the US, it arrived even before the estimated delivery date and even after paying the VAT it was still cheaper than buying it in Germany...The series itself is just great, just see for yourself... definitely worth the money!"
4,First seasons are hard to follow,Don't get me wrong... It was a really good season. I guess it just felt slower after everything that went on in season 1. It's a good buy! I recommend it.
5,Just as awesome as season 1,The only thing I don't like about The Walking Dead is there aren't enough episodes! I wish the seasons were longer because they are so good.
4,Sick!,"This show does not let up. There is always storyline and character development. Finally glad Rick decided to man up! Crazy ending, season 3 can't come soon enough."
5,Finally picking up,"I thought it was a good episode. People need to keep in mind that this is A&E not hbo. They dont have the funding to make every episode action packed. I agree that it is not a non-stop romp of action, but I kinda like that about it. Boiling tension in of world of futile existence."
2,The excitement went with Frank Darabont.,I agree with the comments that the second season is becoming a snooze fest. The first episode of Season 2 was promising. But it went downhill from there. I guess all the excitement left with Frank Darabont.
2,The Thrill Is Gone...,"Maybe I've outgrown my odd affinity for zombies, but The Walking Dead has entered the Land of the Boring Zombies. The characters are dull and most of the plot just doesn't have much kick, tho I admit that Herschel's barn full of walkers was pretty good.This AMC hit just doesn't stack up again Breaking Bad and Hell on Wheels--the 2 best shows on tv...just imho..."
5,Even better!,Best TV show ever! I am just waiting for the DVD release and will immediately get them (I am one of those freak people that LOVE to have hard copies of everything). Hard can wait for the 3rd!
5,Great,"I liked season one, but season two is much better. I also love that their are more episodes. That was my big issue with season one. I love the new characters too."
5,Great show,This season just like the first season was wonderful. I love the graphics and the story. It's tense and heartwarming at times.
4,Good TV show,"Waiting for the second season to be part of Netflix or Amazon Prime instant videos, I watch the first season, got hooked even thought they are some mistakes in the story I like it."
