4,"A fantastic, enthralling series!","The Fey series is such a good read! What first got me hooked on fantasy stories and faeries is A Kiss of Shadows by Laurell K. Hamilton (BEST book ever). My fave characters in this series are Jewel, Nicholas, Arianna, Gift, and Coulter. The love between Jewel and Nicholas, and (my guess is) between Arianna and Coulter is really poignant. The only reason that I didn't rate this series a five is 'cause the author mercilessly killed off several of the characters I enjoyed--Solanda, Burden, and especially Jewel. Sob, sob. I am also hunting up and down for the 4th book, THE RESISTANCE. I wish the publisher would just continue to print it. Happy reading!"
3,collected it,I got this as a gift for my wife. She needed the book to complete her set. I read the book too and I liked it.
4,Good third chapter of the story of the Fey and Blue Island,"I was surprised that this wasn't the end of the story, but I realized half-way through that this story has a long way to go. I poured through the book. A good read with interesting plot twists."
5,Travel book,I had read her earlier book and enjoyed it so ordered this one. I live in Italy part time and find her right on the mark in her look at foreigners trying to decipher how to understand Italians. A Very entertaining book. I am passing it on to all my friends.
5,All Inclusive,What a wonderfully informative book. This book is a must for anyone that wants to really know about Aussies. I hope that people considering purchasing this book won't take the negative reviews that I've seen seriously. They are politically motivated and have nothing to do with the quality and wonderful information in this book.
4,All about Aussies,All about Aussies is a great book for beginners & anyone else. It has everything you need to know!
1,Don't believe whats in this book!!!,"The author totally lost my respect. ""Mini"" Aussies aren't Aussies and she knows they arent.Shame on her for selling her breed out to the ""mini"" fad.Save your money and buy the original version of this book with the blue cover, and NOT THIS ONE!!! The first version has all the info you need and is very honest and truthfull."
5,"Big book, but easy reading",I bought this book as we were researching the Australian Shepherd breed. I found it very helpful and complete. It was also easy reading. I seemed to finish the book in no time at all.
2,constantly crashes on windows XP,"Like another reviewer, I also liked this product, especially its ease of use, and the speed with which you could change your floorplan. But when I got an XP it crashed all the time. To add to the frustration, there is no support from their website for this product. I couldn't even find the product on the site. So I can only recommend it if you have an, apparently older computer. It worked fine using windows 98, but got slower and slower as my plans got more complicated. When I went to windows XP which I though would help, it became useless."
5,Fast and Vast,"This compact flash card works great with my Nikon D200. Though it is not listed in the camera's user guide, it does great. It is very quik both capturing pictures and uploading them to my PC. I am very pleased with the capacity of the card (over 625 pics in JPEG Fine), the speed, and the price."
2,Failures do occur,"I bought a 4GB ultimate 133x CF card. I tested it's speed and it seemed OK. I then loaded 3.5 GB and it took it. So I was convinced it was as described. I took other pics with my Canon 400D SLR and they were fine. I put the card in my computer to read my images and it asked if I wanted to format the card. I formated it and then re-formated it in my Canon to allow it to set up a folder DCIM. But when I tried to take pics, some of them were BLACK! Further card errors showed up and other Black files. They are going to repair the card or send me a new one. I am glad I was not on a critical shoot when this happened.Larry - showmepics"
4,A solid blowing session.,"Jimmy Forrest's tenor which has a warm fat tone, kind of like Ben Webster with a bluesey edge, is the star of this recording from 1961. He displays a gutbucket, bar room blues wail on ""Bolo Blues"", a boppish flair on ""Crash Program"", and a soulful vibrato on the slow numbers ""I've Got A Right To Cry"" and ""Yesterdays"". Backed by Joe Zawinul on piano, Tommy Potter on bass, and Clarence Johnston on drums, Forrest cuts a straightahead blowing session that is a pleasant mix of soulful slow numbers and uptempo material."
5,Jimmy's Best,"I've got a bunch of Jimmy Forrest vinyl, and CDs, and Out of the Forrest is clearly the best -- it is his quintessential LP.His tone is the best I've ever heard it, and his articulation on the very up-tempo Crash Program has got to be heard to be believed. ""Crash"" is the same tune as ""Dog It"" cut on the album Black Forrest, recorded about 18 months earlier. But it sounds to me like he'd been playing this blues head on a lot of gigs because he nails every note and swings better on this later record date.""This Can't be Love"" is also great... Forrest's solo starts at an intense level and goes up from there.The only Jimmy Forrest album that might be of this caliber is ""Most Much"", which has the debatable version of Autumn Leaves... but ""Yesterdays"" from Out of the Forrest is sweater and more accessible to mortals."
3,Standard early Heinlein fare,"This story of life and rebellion in post-nuclear America is driven by an entertaining and fast-moving plot. It contains many of Heinlein's favorite themes: religion, mass psychology, indefatigable American optimism and ingenuity in the face of adversity and oppression. Not to mention the usual undertones of sexism and racism. Recommended for Heinlein fans who can't get enough from this flawed, but undeniably masterful, storyteller."
5,Easy Star does it again,"This is simply another outstanding, must buy, product from the East Star label. I may even end up liking it better than their Dub Side of the Moon."
2,Disappointing,"Like many other people, I really liked Dub Side of the Moon. Besides being a refreshing take on the Floyd classic, the album was simply packed with great dub - throbbing baselines, massive amounts of reverb, cracking snare hits, smoky grooves.So why does Radiodread disappoint so much? First of all, we should make one thing straight - this isn't a ""re-imagining"" of anything. It's a note-for-note cover of OK Computer with guitar chords on 2 + 4 and no h's pronounced - and that's about all that's different. What made Dub Side so great was where it took the material in new directions - the jungle breakbeat on ""On the Run,"" the tricked-out dub rendition of ""Great Gig,"" the toast rap in the middle of ""Money."" None of that can be found here. Instead, we're left with straight-ahead clones of familiar songs that don't have nearly the depth and replayability that Dub Side does. It's a novelty record with a heaping portion of wasted potential."
2,"Not as good as ""Dub Side of the Moon""","After hearing ""Dub Side of the Moon"" I had great hopes for this as well.Alas, it left me disappointed. Not nearly as reggae-ish as ""Dub"". I think fans of both Reggae and Radiohead would be disappointed also."
5,Broad and Deep,"This is a surprising book. I bought on the recommendations here and elsewhere, but when I pulled it from the box I was underwhelmed by it's size. As has been implied here, I was guilty of unfairly judging the book by it's cover. Who'd have thought that a tiny little book could have such a high density of high quality material?I've been surveying the SEO landscape, playing catch-up so to speak, and have bought a number of highly-rated SEO and ""make money on Google"" books recently. This little book provides a highly-concentrated bundle of insights, and is money well-spent. It's certainly up there with the O'Reilly books in terms of the density of useful information and clarity of thought.My only negative note (a very, very mild one) is that it's structured, literally, with A-B-C chapters. Consequently, it's not a ""sit down and read"" book. It's more like an encyclopedia, which actually means it'll be a good reference book later on."
1,Don't waste your time,This book seems to be a compilation of webmasterworld forum posts where the titles are ordered in alphabetical order.Do judge the book by its cover.
2,Not what I was looking for.,If you are looking for a book that is a Dictionary for SEO terms then this book is for you.
2,"It says a lot, yet it says nothing","It's a refference book for mid-level SEO's. It's not for beginners. Read the SEO Bible by Jerri L. Ledford, it's a wee bit better."
5,brahms & franck,"ah~~~that is the moment of artistic orgasm!among this series, aforementioned two sonatasare the best of the best!in my early days....that musics moved me so much...this is the only reason why i bought this edition"
5,the abilene paradox and other medidations on management,It is an excellent and enlightening book with much food for thought and a precise account of reality in malfunctioning organizations. Also provides suggestions for improving organizations and helping them act in an ethical manner.
2,Nice for Nature Photos,"This special was produced by Oregon Public Broadcasting for PBS. It's a series of nature footage shot around Oregon in no particular order. It's NOT a travel-log of what Oregon has to offer. There is no narration; mostly music with beautiful scenes of some of Oregon's great outdoors. It does show the occasional requisite shots of Crater Lake, Mt. Hood, and Haceta Head Lighthouse, but most of this video is of sweeping vistas of mountains and plains. There is a lot of wind noise in the soundtrack making Oregon seem like a windswept, desolate state. SOME of the footage is crystal clear, but there is a fair amount of footage that is so unclear that it looks like it was filmed with a consumer type camcorder. Lots of pixilation in certain shots. I would have expected better quality from PBS. It was fun to watch once, but I don't think I would send it to any of my out of state friends to entice them to come visit. A better video would be the one called ""Oregon State of Wonder -DVD""."
5,America In a Nutshell,"Perhaps the best in this series at showing you a slice of regional American life, this dvd presents the amazing diversity of the beautiful state of Oregon. From pastoral farmland to snowcapped mountains, from waterfall-graced primeval forests to sweeping desert-like terrain, from clear-blue lakes to sparkling rivers, from vineyard country to the Pacific coast sunsets, Oregon has just about everything. Fascinating wildlife, exciting outdoor adventures (including sand-surfing), and input from genuine local residents--this program covers such a broad array of elements. I feel like I've taken a trip around the entire state in eighty minutes. (I'm from the East Coast and haven't yet visited the Pacific Northwest.) Oregon Splendor is a very enjoyable, educational, and value-packed purchase for the armchair traveler, trip planner, or anyone who wants to know more about this lovely state. Lots of substance to this dvd. I highly recommend it."
1,Poor Service Poor Quality,"I was happy to try a name not known to me and experence new things. I was from the start disappointed in the seller and a great delay in the shipping date. I waited and after a extened time frame recieved the unit , opening it was a surprise. Its not much bigger then a cell phone and as this adventure was appt to go, the unit failed to work. I was blessed with a buz and a few hums yet when the i-POD Nano was attached nothing. Worse off since the unit was delayed due to shipping from seller I was without a working gift for the holidays. Sad to say I looked like the worse friend one could have giving a non-working i-POD system on X-max. The smallness and poor quaility of the ubit in whole made me glad it did not work. We now have a much better sounding, looking and shipped on time unit that we are happy with."
1,3 hours of excruciating boredom.,"The dullest movie I've seen in a long time. Over 3 hours of excruciating boredom. The slowest moving movie I've ever seen. If this movie is supposed to be about the meaning of life, any kind of life, good or bad, then it teaches me nothing except the fact that people like to look at each other and stare for long periods of time without saying anything meaningful. Stanley Kubrick, you should be embarrassed. If you want to see a good Kubrick film, watch Dr. Stangelove."
4,PRETTY AS A PICTURE,Stanley Kubricks's long picturesque saga of an Irish rogue in 18th Century Europe is certainly the most entertaining costume drama ever made. Each frame of the film is filled with visual splendor as meticulous as a classic painting. Panoramic battle scenes and richly detailed costume and set designs come alive as from an artist's palette. Ryan O'Neal's bogus Irish accent is easily forgiven as he seems merely a prop in the center of Kubrick's vision of European aristocracy in conflict with an Irishman's independence. The pistol dueling scenes are outstanding.
4,"Good movie, a good look at how a life can go bad","Barry Lyndon was a movie I originally rented becuase I had seen all of Kubricks other movies. SO I saw the two tape set and thought what the heck. I loved this movie. I was suprised and amazed at how this little boy Barry grew up and became such a egomanical jerk. He was sneaky, thrifty, and evil, and watching him manipulate his way into the rich lifestyle was a pleasure. This movie was great"
3,Intricacies of Drama,"I was expecting some kind of British stiff upper lip period piece with quirky characters and lovable uncles and such. Instead, we get a lushly filmed drama of a man with whom we originally sympathize, but later begin to detest. A bit too long for my taste, with a few confusing or ambiguous scenes. I would recommend this film only if you have a few hours to spare and if you appreciate the intricacies of fine drama."
4,"Badly, Badly Miscast","Ryan O'Neal does a terrible, repeat, TERRIBLE job as trying to feign an Irish accent. It is like he is not even trying. The grace in the movie is that the story is much better than the acting of O'Neal. It is a shame that Liam Neeson was not old enough at the time to portray Barry Lyndon: everything else in the movie is great, but O'Neal's disinterested acting makes it a toss-up between comic and dramatic...especially the part when he ""beats up"" on a much heavier and savvy soldier in a bare-knuckled fight. ""Might-en I be allowed to keep my horse?"" Keep the horse, and spare us the acting."
4,Almost like being there,"This work is a beautiful production. The scenery, costumes and lighting are superb. Admittedly, some of the situations and clothing are rather comical viewed from the 21st century, and I spent much of the time on the verge of laughing. I enjoyed most of the story. It just keeps getting better and better -- until the intermission. Why does this young man suddenly begin behaving in an utterly atrocious manner? He wasn't a saint to begin with, but I had hoped for some kind of redemption as his life progressed. Guess I should have read the book. I would like to see the whole last part where he becomes a better person. That would be just too Hollywood and not true to the novel. So it should remain as it stands after all. In my rewatching of the DVD I just turn it off when the intermission comes. But I do watch it again and again."
3,Nice Photography But Unremarkable Plot,"The cinematography is the real star. The atmosphere and costumes convincingly put the viewer into a completely different world. But the plot was unmemorable for me. So Redmond Barry was a morally corrupt womanizer? Big deal. This movie is really just a nice vacation in a lush countryside (a movie museum, if you will)."
5,"The ""Thack"" would be well pleased","Having never read the Thackery novel this movie was based on, I would still have to say the author would have been well pleased at the outcome. I have no idea how much, if any, the novel differs from the film but the film is just beautiful, and the blu-ray is so much better than the standard issue dvd I bought years ago. This is the way I remember it when it was in the theater in what? 1976? It is so sharp and clear and there are no black bars top, bottom, or sides of the screen. I don't know about aspect ratios or any of that, but I have a widescreen tv and it fills the screen completely.I love the narration, and the lovely landscapes are indeed like paintings. Terrific music. I would highly recommend adding this to your collection. I go back and forth between this and The Godfather for my favorite film, somedays it's one, somedays it's the other and somedays it's a tie."
4,Better than I remembered - poor DVD transfer,"Just re-viewed this after many years. First, the DVD itself was disapointing - mine was part of the Kubrick Collection 6 DVD set. All the other DVDs work well (though i hate the fact that some of them are full screen - despite the fact that's supposedly what Kubrick wanted) - but this DVD is doubled layered - and my DVD player has a lot of trouble reading the disk - with screen pauses between each scene!But the film itself was very entertaining - yes it's long, but the cinematography is great - and I noticed all sorts of trick Kubrick plays with the viewer -"
1,LET THE BUYER BEWARE,"By reading the other reviews, I appear not to be the first consumer who fell prey to the new box cover. Despite the new artwork that says ""Newly Restored and Remastered"", this is the same master as the previous versions. I had previously purchased the earlier version (letterboxed and poor quality). I had been waiting for a newly mastered version, and when I saw this new artwork (and that all of the other Warner Kubrick titles had been remastered for enhanced 16X9 viewing), I figured that BARRY LYNDON had also been. My big mistake and my great disappointment. So much for truth in packaging."
4,Fantasic - worth the wait,"There are parts of the Blu-ray of ""2001"" that flicker (closeups of HAL's eye) and have splotches; plus, the transfer technology has gotten better, so I wish a new version of that were done. I know ""Barry Lyndon"" was harder to clean up because every edit on the VHS version had a slightly crooked 1st frame and the isolated dialogue had a lot of hiss, so it had to be faded up and down whenever anyone started and stopped speaking for most scenes, which shows Kubrick was a perfectionist at most things but not all. These distractions have been fantastically corrected for the Blu-ray version, and since the film is 3 hours long, I'd guess this was one of the main reasons for its delayed release. The only oddity is Warner Bros. selfishly replaced the VERY dramatic opening red and black animated WB logo with a dull, static black and white one, so they could add ""A Time Warner Company"" at the bottom."
2,Not what WE are expecting!,"Oh, C'mon! We don't deserve this. We don't need a simple transfer for BD. Barry Lyndon is one of of the few films you really feel experiencing being in the past. There must be lots of material of the production and design of the film. This is THE Stanley Kubrick film that deserves the better treatment. A TWO-DISC SPECIAL EDITION! DVD or BD.I think I am speaking for the whole Kubrick's Lot."
5,One of my top ten favorite films of all time.,"Barry Lyndon is one of the greatest films ever made (in my opinion). If Stanley Kubrick had to be remembered for one film then this is the one. Beautifully filmed and directed, Kubrick also manages to get the best performance ever out of the highly underrated actor Ryan O'Neil. Based upon the novel of the same title, this Barroque era saga follows the life of Redmond Berry who flees from his small hamlet in Ireland to seek fame and fortune. I have never seen such a masterpiece of a film. Don't let the era of this movie prevent you from watching this celluloid gem. You wont regret it!Intellectual eye candy. Witty banter and perfect framing and cinematography makes this film a must see. You also get to see Ryan O'Neil act his for once in his life!!Great stuff from a master film maker!"
5,Kubrick's most underrated film,"Stanley Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"" is seldom considered to be among his best films, despite winning numerous awards at the the time including four Oscars. Chiefly known as a technically accurate, beautifully filmed period piece, it offers much more. All of Kubrick's films use music effectively, but none surpass the soundtrack to ""Barry Lyndon"", including ""2001"".The script by Kubrick is perhaps his very best. This film contains a sense of wit and beauty that has not been equalled before or since. A magical film from the finest artist of this past century."
5,The best movie I never have seen,"How is possible to say that this movie is boring? Who says this expects from a movie to have an easy argument, that is, to be only an understanding story. But this movie doesn't need a plot, Stanley Kubrick makes the most of cinema possibilities to create genuine art; the best music and plasticity together, for example the scene where Barry and lady Lindon 'meet' around the table, the best cinema scene by far I have seen. But, at the same time, this movie shows fellings and manners: love, pride, power relationships, just in the best way in accordance with the period related. I think this is what there is to understand watching this movie. What's Hamlet's plot? Hamlet himself."
1,barry lyndon expurgated,The Barry Lyndon dvd that you sent has been censored. I have seen this movie over the years and several scenes are missing in this version. I would like relief.
4,"Great, but not Kubrick's best","I bought this on amazon.com before seeing it. I watched it the day it came. This is a powerful film and easily the most beautiful as for costumes and scenery, but it wasn't his best. This to me was great and meaningful but it doesn't really qualify of Kubrick films. When I think of Kubrick I think of THE SHINING or A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Not BARRY LYNDON. Although I really liked this film, it doesn't have the Kubrick touch that DR. STRANGELOVE, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, THE SHINING, FULL METAL JACKET, EYES WIDE SHUT, or LOLITA brings to the screen. Don't get me wrong, this was an excellent film, but very unlike Kubrick films. This in a way falls in the catagory of 1956's THE KILLING and 1960's Spartacus. Those were both great films but they didn't feel like Kubrick. But do see this movie! I liked the first video better than the second (BARRY LYNDON had two tapes because it's a little over 3 hours). But if you enjoy good cinema, rent or buy this!"
3,kubrick at his not so very best,"I am a huge Stanley Kubrick fan and loved all of his movies, except this one. That's not to say it was bad, it was quite good at parts, but definitely not up to Kubrick standards. Technically marvelous, it was shot in all natural light. The costumes were marvelous as were the sets and as a historical movie it was pretty well made. It was way too long however and the performances were lifeless to say the least. Personally I would have prefered to see Kubrick tackle Napoleon if he was going to do a historical epic."
1,Will not play on my LG BD300 Blu-Ray Player,This disc will not play on my LG BD300 Blu-Ray player. I have other Region Free discs that will. Downloaded the latest BD300 firmaware and no luck. The film itself is a 5 star film. The disc plays fine on my Sherwood BDP-5004 BR player.
3,whoop de doo,"Recently I ordered Barry Lyndon Blu-ray, which hasn't arrived yet. What has arrived is an email from Amazon informing me that I have received, as a gift for making the purchase, a video-on-demand of the same movie. Sounds swell, doesn't it? But read the find print. You'll have two weeks in which to watch it--after which it's unavailable. And within that two-week period, once you begin watching it, you'll have 48 hours in which to complete your one-time viewing.What a gift this is, Mr. Bezos! Whoop de doo!"
2,NOT WHAT I REMEMBERED,"After about 30 years and several years of telling family members that Barry Lyndon was a really good movie, I finally purchased it. Well, the movie isn't what I remembered it to be. Nicely directed, good cinematography, but it is only a 70s movie and probably should stay there."
1,Overrated,"This film is overrated--BARRY LYNDON is all style and no substance. I'm glad I rented it first. Three superior costume films: Tony Richardson's TOM JONES, Stephen Frear's DANGEROUS LIASONS and Fred Zinnemann's A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS."
1,ONE STAR ON A GOOD DAY!,"This is not only Kubrick's worst film, but possibly one of the worst films of all time. Boring does not begin to describe it. The movie would be much better off in an hour and a half version. Don't waste your time!"
1,amazzzzzing,"So here's someone who's supposed to be a great director and he has such subject matter as love, war, duels, adultery, espionage, dissipation and corruption of youth, and any number of other themes to work with. And what does he do? Makes it into a monumental three-hour BORE! The actors just walk on, say a few lines, walk off. Ryan O'Neal stands around with his mouth hanging open for most of the movie. Hardly says a word. I guess they didn't want it known that he couldn't do an Irish accent very well (or much of anything else except look pretty in his pretty clothes). It's as if Kubrick did all he could to underplay and downplay everything. Well, very subtle, very dull. This and 2001 almost put him in the same category of over-rated directors as Hitchcock, though at least Kubrick has Lolita and Dr. Strangelove to his credit."
1,A Serious Disappointment,"This package promising a ""New Digital Master"" widescreen DVD turned out to be an old, washed out fullscreen pan and scan. Buyer beware! These product profiles can be maddeningly incomplete, if not downright deceptive. Customer service has promised a full refund, but I'd been looking forward to seeing the movie again, even if it was only the ""2000"" edition. Though I've been a happy book customer for years, this was the first DVD I'd ordered from Amazon, and it'll probably be the last. Who needs the inconvenience?"
1,"Kubrick fan, except for this movie.","I am an avid Kubrick fan, hell I even enjoyed Spartacus and Eyes Wide Shut, but I cannot bring myself to recommend this based on the name attached alone. Although his directorial presence is still very much active in the cinematography and style of the work, the entertainment value to be found is nonexistent. The way I would describe this film is, Gone With the Wind without any of the interesting bits. A boring film about Irish aristocracy, the only people who could possibly enjoy this movie are cinematographers and history buffs. Do not be enticed by the intriguing DVD cover, for even the most die-hard Kubrick fan this movie isn't worth your time."
1,"Dammit Amazon, Seperate Your Product Reviews Already!","First off; I have not purchased THIS PARTICULAR version of this all-time great film, however, I do want to purchase it for a friend who has bluray. The problem with this particular release is that the bluray version seems to be a terrible transfer. My real issue here aside from the fact that Warner Brothers continues to foist garbage transfers on an unsuspecting public is that ONCE AGAIN, Amazon.com refuses to separate it's product reviews, so it is simply IMPOSSIBLE for me to ascertain the quality of the DVD RELEASE vs. the BLURAY RELEASE.AMAZON.COM, if you are going to continue to provide customer reviews, PLEASE STOP mixing reviews for separate products together; The QUALITY OF INDIVIDUAL RELEASES IS DIFFERENT AND AFFECTS THE CUSTOMER'S DECISION TO BUY!"
5,they are all equal now,"without the amazing cinematography, serene settings, masterful costuming, and revolutionary approach to lighting, Barry Lyndon would still be a very good movie. It is a beautiful stylized act of fictional biography more like a novel than any film of its genre. It should be metnioned however that the length and pacing of the film (which attributed to its popular failure upon release) can be a strong deturant to those of a nervous disposition."
1,Great Movie! Lousy film transfer on DVD.,"The actual film version is breathtaking. Warner has done a terrible job with the transfer to DVD. The image (viewed on a a Sony DVD player) is very jittery and lacks proper contrast and color balance. One of the worst DVD presentations I've seen. Apparently they digitized it at a low bit rate to cram the long film into one disk. I can't explain why. Try ""A Clockwork Orange"" or ""Lolita"" for better (though not great) transfers."
4,Powdewred Wigs and Knee Britches,A great flick. Today this film would cost an unbelievable amount of money. the costumes are great and the military actions are well done.
1,Wrong magazine,"If you are buying this please note - it is not Digital Photo magazine (UK). For subscriptions to Digital Photo magazine (UK), please see the magazine's own web site or details inside the mag."
1,Do not buy if you do not read GERMAN!!,Magazine company is helping to get me a refund but still sucks that you wait 2 months for a magazine and then can not read it.Magazine is probably very good but I place 100% of the blame on Amazon.
1,still no magazine..................,I still have not received the magazine so not review is possible. When do you think I will receive my first copy?
1,Ugh!,"Ever had the experience of hearing a song you liked on the radio, buying the album, and feeling like you were tricked? Based on hearing Track 11 on the local jazz station I assumed the rest of the record would be a similarly joyful homage to Bird and his transcendent music. Uh, no. I never thought it would be possible for an album allegedly inspired by Bird to be so depressing, leaden and boring. Maybe there's a market for this sort of ""music"" and there's no accounting for taste, but only buy this CD if you like muddy machine-like noise. Bird does not live in these tracks."
2,Why?,"I'm sure this is great stuff for the right demographic, and I'm glad if it turns people on to Charlie Parker. As for me, I hate seeing Birds music dumbed down in order to appeal to the MTV generation. My advise: Go Buy a real jazz album. Maybe a Charlie Parker."
1,Bird Lives - But not here.....,"I tend to agree with the 'why bother' reviewers. Bird's wonderful melodies are lost, as are the rhythms....it's all a little to self-congratulatory really. I was hoping for something more in the line of the Verve ReMix stuff, something that adds to the original rather than taking it to pieces and trying to construct something new. Some of it is barely listen-able and some seems to have no relation to Bird's music other than small sound bites thrown into add colour to a very uninspired creation."
5,BIRD IS THE WORD,"Bird Up: The Charlie Parker Remix Project is a beautiful experience to be had by all. It has really helped me to understand how Charlie Parker was and still is the beat to the heart of true music.From the first hypnotic vocals of Red Hawk's Now's the Time (No Time Like Now) to El-P's star bound Constellation (Heavenly Bodies), this album breaks the sound barrier and takes you on an everlasting joy ride into the future.If you're UP, see you in the future!"
4,doom wind,It started out slightly slow but picked up quickly. Once it did I was reluctant to put it down. I found myself wishing there was more to read.
3,Flavoring is so-so; use 'em anyway on someone new,"As readers of my reviews know, I love the female ass. It is supreme. I've done just about everything that can be done with it and to it. The thing is though, when you're with someone new it can be risky to engage in anilingus with all the stuff waiting for you at the rear-door to Heaven. So, you might want to use these until you and partner (if you plan on being with each other over a time) become bacterially well-acclimated. The vanilla (no, ""chocolate"" is not included) is my favorite. On your mark, get set, EAT!"
4,Source for learning healthy eating and illness prevention,I recommend this book to anyone who would like to loose weight for good and maintain a healthy lifestyle. It shows you the foods to eat for optimum benefits as well as the harmful foods to avoid.
5,"Excellent book for an eating lifestyle, not diet","Love this book. It makes sense and the author has made nutrition understandable, and easy. My family was eating better the first day I had the book. No complicated recipes or ingredients, and the food is delicious. I highly recommend this book to everyone."
2,Disappointed,"The item I received didn't look like what I ordered. It was very low to the floor, the picture of the man with his arm on it while driving is misleading. I returned it. I thought for the price and after reading the reviews I would be thrilled. It was worth maybe $35 but not $100!!"
3,Poor quality,"Good design, poor cheap quality material, cap loose with screws around i liked it but wont buy it again folks"
4,Enchanting story but weak ending,"I truly loved this book, just like I love all of Nick Bantock's books, but this one left me bereft and slightly puzzled at the ending. Though the content at the beginning and middle was almost tangible, the end left me with many questions and slightly disappointed."
5,"A book of magnificent, imaginative journies.","Both thrilling and sensual The Venetian's Wife is truly one of Nick Bantock's superior works. It's storyline is brisk and involving, and although Sara, the main character, may seem dull and removed at first, is quickly shown to be caring and adventurous.Through the reading of diaries and letters the reader is brilliantly transported into the personal lives of Sara, her love interest, and her mysterious employer. It is almost tantalizing and in some way mischievous to read, what in reality would be a person's deepest and most personal thoughts.Perallel only to the writing and involving storyline is Nick Bantock's beautiful art. Both on the side of whime and passion it adds brilliantly to the book's overall mood.An excellent work, which was so incompassing I had to read it without stopping. Perfect for anyone who craves adventure, love, mystery, fantasy, and or art."
2,a weak ending breaks the spell,"I could not put the Venetian's Wife down as soon as I started reading it. I loved the beautiful pictures on each page and though the characters are somewhat shallow the author's economy works well with the plot, which is so original and unpredictable! This was my first experience with Bantock's writing. I had alway meant to check out his Griffin and Sabine books because the art work looks so interesting. I received the Venetian's Wife as a gift. I am an art historian and work at an art museum so my brother thought the book was particularly appropriate for me. Until the very end, The Venetian's Wife was one of my favorite books; however, I found the end extremely disappointing. I felt cheated and angry; like the author did not finish his work."
3,3 stars for the story -- 5 for the art,"_The Venetian's Wife_ was the first book I read by Nick Bantock. I have heard wonderful reviews of his other books, and was really looking forward to a great reading experience. Unfortunately, the story was pretty weak. I did like the epistolatory style of the book: all emails, journal entries, and letters.A museum conservator is emailed with a wonderful proposition: find 4 pieces of ancient art that belong to The Conti Foundation collection. The patron tells her he will pay her extremely well, and naturally she accepts the offer, and awaits further instruction. There are some interesting excerpts from Sara's travels, however, the story lost my attention quickly. The idea behind the story had great potential, but poor execution.However, I do plan to pick up some of Bantock's other books. The art alone was beautiful, and according to other reviews, his other books are much better."
5,One of my favorites....,"""The Venetian's Wife"" is one of my favorite books. I enjoy the blend of technology, religion, archetypes, and a ghost. While some elements, like the Vatican order, seemed a bit out of place or ""thrown in"", the character development is superb."
4,Another Bantock Masterpiece,"I loved this book, except for the ghost angle. I think there could have been a better explanation. The art was beautiful, as you'd expect from a Nick Bantock book. The characters were wonderful, and I love books where you can get inside the heads of the protagonists, something that Bantock excells at. Not quite as good as Griffin & Sabine (but is anything), it is still an excellent read."
2,"cute concept, lacks character development and depth.","Too much attention to art and illustrations, which would be fine if the rest of the book did not suffer substantially from the effort.Lovely coffee table book - not much of a read."
5,Voyager returns home,"I believe Diane Carey did a good adapting what was an ok script. She added details which were not shown in the final episode (Chakotay's conversation with Seven about similarities between Seven and his mother; Paris's thoughts while his wife is giving birth and worrying about the Borg: etc.)I believe this book would have been better as a regular size paperback but I enjoyed it alot. I also can't wait for Christie Golden's Voyager Homecoming Novel. The sneak peek we were given was excellent. I hope it comes out soon and that Miss Golden comes up with a new and improved version of Voyager...""Voyager A"" for the crew to reunite on and find a way to save the baby that was assimilated"
2,"I love Voyager, but this is ridiculous!","What the heck happened? I know Diane Carrey can write because SHip of The Line was Trek at its best. I just came away from this noveliaztion with a bad taste. First I got a Dick and Jane style of writing, picture book sized book with big letters to fill up space, and an awful cover that didn't do justice to the show. I know that there are a lot of fans who are disgruntled with TPTB over how VOY was handled, but I loved the finale and hated this book. Maybe Homecoming will be better."
2,My review,"This book is little more than a transcription of the series finale. Carey is a capable writer, unfortunately the script, on which this book is based, is weak source material. ENDGAME, the novel, doesn't really add to the story presented on television. The plot is as contrived as anything yet seen on VOYAGER, and the characters are as one-dimensional as their televised avatars. On the flip side, it is easy to read, and inoffensive. Lastly, this book was published as a trade paperback to offset reduced sales (since the novel was released so long after ""Endgame"" was televised, sales would be much lower than they would had the book appeared at the same time as the episode). It would have been a little more considerate if the publisher had, at least, included a photo insert."
1,Not really worth the Money,"I have always been a fan of novelization of show or movies because I think that the novel enriches the story, but the case of the novelization of Endgame just is not worth the money. The book did nothing to add on to the of Star Trek Voyager last show. The writing of Diane Carey is usually very good, but in this case it like she just copy from the script. The ONLY reason someone may want to buy it is get a preview of the up coming book ""Homecoming"" by Christie Golden. Beside this I can't see any reason in purchasing the book."
4,Well done overall,"I found this book to be well done. The first 3/4 of it is almost ver-batum to the final episode but the last 1/4 was very interesting is showing what happens after they get back, how the characters adapt. I didn't think that bring Picard and the Enterprise into it was really necessary as it really served no purpose other than to show where Janeway got her taste for tea. The ""cliffhanger"" ending was really unnessary though. But overall a good read."
5,Fun and Serious at the Same Time,"Philly, a young girl, tries to figure out why Janey, a woman with Down's Syndrome who has just moved in with them, fits into her family better than Philly's dad ever did. A wonderful book--I read it as a high school student and loved it. Kids everywhere will sympathize with Philly's Science Fair experiences. But it's not just a fun novel, it's also a sensitive portrayal of a woman with a disability. There's a moving bit describing a visit to the institution where Janey used to live."
3,"Good Book, But Not Balanced","I've had this book for many years and re-read parts of it occasionally as it provides good biographic sketches of some of the Luftwaffe's great fighter pilots and a sense of what they experienced.However, I agree with the other critics who have found the book to lack balance, and this lack of balance is a serious shortcoming to this work. The protagonists are presented in a very idealized manner, and there is very little recognition of the fact that they were fighting for one of the most detestable regimes in all of history. The authors express great indignation at the way many of the German pilots were treated in Soviet captivity both during and after the war, but there is scarcely a word on the subject of the abhorrent way Soviet POWs were treated by the Germans, and the millions of Soviet POWs who were killed or allowed to die from ill treatment. And I'm sure that not all of the Luftwaffe pilots were the ""gallant knights"" this book tries to depict them as being."
2,Overblown and overpriced...,"I was not very impressed with some aspects of this book. The authors seem to believe that every Luftwaffe experte was the perfect specimen of a man. In their efforts to romanticise these people, I believe they do the pilots and themselves an injustice. They have left many gaping holes in their research (which in one case they were silly enough to highlight) and although much of the book covers some rarely-seen aspects, I found it less-than satisfying. Whilst I accept that the authors knew some of the characters involved, I would have appreciated a rather more frank discussion. That makes it less than good value for money and not as much fun as Mike Spick's book on the same subject (though his is, of course, far less detailed and much cheaper)."
5,Practitioner's comments,"I am a partner at a firm and had to order my own copy of this book because the library's copy was always checked out. Even though I have been practicing for over ten years, this book provided strategies that I had not considered before in dealing with the I.R.S. I recommend it because it gives you theory and practice that can be used everyday in disputing matters with the I.R.S. I also recommend it to our new associates because it provides the basics of the how's and why's that are important to understand before one begins any audit,collection or litigation against the government."
1,Not as described,I had the exact same experience as the first reviewer. Only one tag showed up in the order. Amazon is refunding and I don't have to ship it back. But the hassle is not worth the one free tag I got. Especially when I needed 12 and now I have to find them somewhere else.
5,Got all 12,"I needed bilingual hang tags and I took a chance on these. The previous reviews which stated they only received 1 were from about a year ago. I was hoping Amazon would have fixed it and they did. I received all 12, along with 12 zip ties. They are just like the picture."
3,Flies a Kite,"This book doesn't really teach kids like some of the other books. The book is about a mokey, and it is always getting into trouble but never facing the consiqunces. I real life young kids are courious but they don't always excape like in the book. This book is a good adventure book but not a good learning book"
2,Not Good Ideals for our Children,"Curious George always seems to be getting into incredible trouble, yet he always seems to escape the consequences. This book is giving our children an unreal view of how the consequences of their actions can be avoided. Curious George rates highly on the literature scale, but when reading this book to our children, they need to understand that the adventures George gets himself into are fictional. They need to understand that we need to be responsible for our actions, and consequences are needed to develop their moral character."
4,Longer than anticipated,"We own almost every Curious George book that has been published, either paperback or a collection of stories in a hardcover. I noticed we were missing one, so I ordered this without really reading anything about it. When it arrived as a stocking stuffer for Christmas, I was surprised at how thick it is! Our kids (ages 4 and 2) really enjoy it, but sometimes we have to put it off for another night if it's late and the kids need to get to sleep. It's almost like a few different Curious George books combined into one.Overall, though, it's a very cute book and I'm glad I bought it. It came with a read-along CD, which we have yet to try out. This is certainly a must-have for those who love Curious George!(As a side note, Curious George is not actually a ""monkey,"" because monkeys have tails. George is an ape.) :o)"
3,Being childless by choice...,"I noticed that several reviewers seem to think that making this decision is ""selfish,"" ""ridiculous,"" ""unbelievable,"" etc. I would argue that, given the fact that society ""expects"" women to want (and have) children, the decision not to takes a lot of thought, a lot of courage, and a lot of self-evaluation. We respect people's decisions to have children. Those who choose not to deserve the same respect--and perhaps they have actually earned it.Anyway--I appreciate the fact that someone has tried to approach this issue with intelligence--even if, in the end, the message is not truly what it started out to be."
2,Boring!,"After reading and loving something borrowed,I was a little dissappointed with something blue,but this book is worse.I finished it,but wouldn't recommend it to a friend.I also didn't like the end.After waiting for the whole book for the events to be solved,I have expected to read something from the future of the characters as well.Sorry Emily,it looks like the writing is not getting improved by each novel."
3,Something a little better...,"I was browsing the library for my next read and quickly grabbed this book in my quick search. After scanning the book I thought it was an interesting plot. Once I got home I realized it was written by Emily Giffin the same author of ""Something Borrowed,"" and ""Something Blue;"" Which made me now skeptical of this book selection choice (by the way Ethan makes a cameo). I will say this is the best book I've read from her, but the resolution of the book was unsatisfying. To me the character fell flat, they seemed very two dimensional. Also, a lot of the story just doesn't seem possible, in that the reactions of the characters just seem artificial. I also did not like how she spoiled ""Out of Africa"" the movie, one I've been meaning to watch. I'd say for a quick read...why not go ahead and read it, but won't be my first Chick lit recommendation to anyone."
3,Fluffy Read,"This was a good book, fluffy and easy read. Sometimes reading a fluffy book is just what a person needs."
4,Emily did it again,"I can't get enough of Emily Griffin, she keeps me wanting more. She's never disappoints this faithful and devoted reader."
4,Baby proof was awesome,"I really enjoyed the book. I felt like I was Claudia at one point I felt her pain and the hurt she experience with her breakup with Ben. I think that there were times where I wanted to just know what was going to happen, but I just read and gathered the information. The book was a page turner I was so sucked into the book at times. Absolutely love it."
4,...Good...,"The title says it all. I looked forward to reading it every night but it wasn't the best book ever. The ending was a little flat, in my opinion. However, the book moved along well and was entertaining. I liked it a lot, just didn't love it and didn't love the ending. Unless...there's a sequel to this one :)The writing style in this book is just like her others, entertaining throughout, rush at the end to come to a predictable ending but with a few twists that keep you guessing if maybe, just maybe, it won't be the ending you're expecting.Worth the read but if you can get a used copy that would be even better.Waiting for a sequel."
2,Only read if you have nothing better to do with your time,"I didn't like this book for a couple of reasons:1) The author was very long winded providing way too much irrelevant details. For example, if someone had a nickmame, she would provide a 2 page explanation about how that person got their nickname.2) The main character Claudia went through a life changing experience only to the end the book feeling the same way she did at the beginning of the book. It felt like a waste of time."
4,Couldn't put it down,"I couldn't put this book down and finished it within two days. The style that this author writes in really appeals to me. I got immersed in this book and the characters lives. The topic wasn't something I could relate to, but the story of these people still interested me. There were a few funny moments, and a few poignant moments as well. I can relate to the authors references of certain products or experiences in growing up--and I think most 30 somethings will relate. I have read two other books by this author:Something BorrowedandSomething Blue. I like that the author included the truth that decisions that are right for some people, are not right for others in certain situations, thats how real life is....."
4,Cute,"This was a cute, light read. I enjoyed reading this book, although Ben, the main character's husband, irritated me. When you make commitment, you can just change your mind & expect the other person to join you. Claudia was firm on her decision to not have children, which is also one of the biggest commitments of your life. To change your mind & get upset with the other person for not following you is rude. However, through my irritation, I did enjoy the book."
5,Can't go wrong with Emily Giffin,"I have read all of Emily's books and will continue to read anything written by this author. Her characters are engaging, some likeable and some not, but you find yourself still wanting to know what will become of them."
4,OK Read,"I've read most of her other books. This is typical Emily Giffin. Lovey-dovey story, everything works out in the end. It's nice to read in between other books, and I do enjoy a simple read every now and then. It depends on what you like to read, but I have to be in the right mood for her books."
4,something to ponder,"Another amazing book by this author. This was the first one I read by her-so I did not know what to expect. The author has a way of making you see both sides, so seamlessly that it is hard to figure out where you stand. She has a gift and her writing is magical."
4,I like Emily Giffin's Books,"Easy to read, lots of good characters as usual from Emily. If you like her writing, you will like this book."
1,How does this woman get published?,"You would think I'd have learned sooner, but after three Emily Giffin novels I can finally say ""never again."" Giffin has an amazing talent in that she exhausts many, many words to create characters that are completely flat and impossible to care about. I believe that she has character development confused with peppering her story with random musings and observations from her own life, thinking that this creates unique people within her story. Instead, it just showcases her laziness. I also take issue with her brand of ""strong woman,"" which is actually just an irritating, selfish, caricature of a Manhattan professional."
2,Eh.,"Loved Something Blue and Something Borrowed. Did not like this book @ all. Read the whole thing hoping it would get better. The story/plot is unrealistic, far fetched, messy, and not well thought through.Seems like the author wrote this book to meet contract obligations under deadline and/or was under duress.Going to read her 4th book. I hope it's consistent w/the other two books."
3,Just okay.. Didn't come up to SoBo and SoBlue.,"I love Giffin's books but somehow missed this one along the way! I wanted to love it but just didn't. I really related to the main character and her conflict in the book, but I just couldn't get into the story. I think that the one subject (not having kids with a husband who wants them) was just kind of beat to death by the end of the book. I just got tired of it I suppose. The plot did thicken towards the end, but it wasn't enough for me."
2,"Great Writer, Depressing Subject","After Reading her first 2 books, I had eagerly picked this up. I was looking for something that was a step beyond the light hearted ""chick lit"" as were her other books. However, what I found was a rather depressing novel about a very selfish woman. I could not continue with the book after the 4th chapter or so. Complete disappointment."
2,Disapponted,I was a huge fan of Giffin's two previous books so I thought for sure I'd love this one as well. I liked it toward the beginning then lost complete interest by the time I was around page 140 or so. I just couldn't read any more so I skipped to the end and read the last two chapters. Majorly disappointed. I'm hoping the fourth books will be more like the first two.
2,Disappointing,"I enjoy a good chick-lit novel now and then, but this one was disappointing. The plot was thin and predictable, held no surprises, and the artificial happy ending was obvious and almost insulting. We were given no real reason for the character's change of heart. And the book treated divorce flippantly, like it's just another break-up, no fuss, no muss.Save your $$. There's better chick-lit out there!"
1,Boring,"I was excited about this book- loved Something Borrowed & Something Blue. It was one of two books I bought for vacation. It is so SLOW & BORING. The main character is a almost annoying me & I was reading it thinking when is something going to actually happen? I made it to the part about her going through their CD's which was so immature & then after the part about picking a for her ""last dinner"" with Ben I started scanning pages instead of reading which led to skipping pages to see if anything started to happen cause everything is so drawn out and boring... Just get to the point already blah, blah, blah... I don't even know if I want to waste any more time reading it! I don't understand how anyone can this one 5 stars..."
1,Baby Proof,"I had high hopes for this book. I loved Something Borrowed and Something Blue. This book is so slow and boring. The main character is a pathetic immature woman who can't make up her mind. I did not realize the whole book was going to be about her sex capades and empty life, always wondering if the grass was greener on the other side. Seriously immature and Jess is equally pathetic. She haphazardly takes birth control pills and has a pregnancy scare but it was stupid and shows her ignorance. I keep skipping pages to further this thing along. The characters are so shallow. I may not be able to finish the book."
4,Typical Giffin,"I read the Blue and Pink books first, and was excited to read Giffin's other books. Baby Proof is the same quick read with the happy ending. As much as i enjoy her fictional chick lits, is she capable of something more deep?"
3,It was ok,I have read all of Emily Griffin books and this one had to be my least favorite. It was a good book but did not captivate my interest as much as her others.
4,A highly addictive light read,"I enjoyed Baby Proof very much. I read the whole thing in a day. It got started very quickly. I loved all Claudia's delimma vs her sisters and best friend. Very insightful. The ending didn't wrap it up enough for me, so I gave it 4/5."
3,Weak ending voids the reason to read this book,"This book is ok. I liked the premise of the plot, but hated the ending. The author flails at the end. She didn't have the courage to take a stand on the fundamental issue of the book; instead she opts to end the book in uncertainty. Clearly she's trying not to piss off feminists and traditional types at the same time. It just turns out weakly."
4,Who wants a baby anyway?,"This book rang true to my feelings, along with my husband's about having children. This book has a different writing style than Emily's other two books, that makes it a little difficult to read right after them. The book is easy to read, and worth the money if you enjoyed Something Borrowed, and Something Blue! I enjoyed the read...it hits close to home for a lot of newly-weds these days that just want to enjoy being married!"
5,Still one of my favs!,"In this one, it makes you think of what if you change your mind after all these years? It was of course amazing, just as the rest of Emily Giffin's books!! another non-stop page turner of course!!"
4,Baby Proof,This was a good read! I have read all three of Emily Giffin's books and this was right up there! It's hard to put the book down!
3,Baby Proof,"Like some other readers, I enjoyed the plot and the book, but hated the ending. I was hoping for a book about a woman who learns a lesson about self-reliance and how you don't need external things to make you happy but that happiness comes from within yourself (and not from the ""right man"" ""right things""). Up until the last 50 pages or so I'd say this was an awesome book, though. The main character is strong and the story shows how she deals with her relationship failure in a believable way (no spoilers there - the breakup happens in the first 10 pages). I really disliked the overall theme that ""true love conquers all"" - meaning, in this case, that if you truly love someone you will give up your hopes or dreams. I think it should be that if you truly love someone, you would NEVER want them to give up those things!"
3,"Good story line, average read","I great story line, but I found the main character ""Claudia"" not very likeable. I can't put my finger on exactly what it was, but she just seemed very cold. It didn't have to do with the fact that she didn't want kids (and I get that), it was something else. Also, there were parts of the story that I just found less believable.While the book held my interest, I would say it's just average. I did listen to the abridged audio version read by Cynthia Nixon, who has a nice voice, but has a rather flat reading style. I may get the book from the library to see which sections were ""abridged"", which add to something needed, but I am thinking that it may not.I will probably try another by emily griffin based on good reviews, but listening to this book alone would not compell me to readd more."
2,Sell Out Pretty Much Says It All,"I truly enjoyed Giffens first two books, but this one was a total let down. I knew where it was going from the beginning. I like Giffen's style of writing and I thought that this would be a well written book about the true relationship of a couple with one common goal - to be child free. I know one couple with no children and my own son does not want any and I give people credit for the soul searching it takes to realize it. However, Baby Proof is not the right title for this book because Giffen did not follow through on the idea. What a disappoinment. It would have been nice to read a positive story about the other side in those who choose not to have children. I knew when it started exactly how it was going to end and it was a complete sell out of the idea. Too bad."
2,Different than the others by griffin,"""Baby Proof"" was so different than the other 3 by Emily Griffin. It starts slow and drags on. Maybe it's the development of the characters and the issues that they are dealing with, but this is my least favorite and I LOVED all the others!!!"
3,Baby Proofed,"This is hands down my favorite Emily Giffin novel. I'm pretty sure that's because I identified with the unlikely heroine. Much like Claudia, I have no desire to have children, ever, but don't feel I ought to be perceived any the lesser for it (in fact, I'm often persecuted for this). This is a chick lit book which tackles a different perspective as for once it's the female who doesn't want a baby. She's happily married, content with her family, successful in her career - what more is there to want? When her husband changes his mind about wanting a child, Claudia's entire life shifts in the balance. Supporting characters are unique and amusing, from her flighty mother to her captivating best friend, her charming older suitor to her imaginative niece. The novel asks that all important question - just exactly what will you or won't you give up for love?"
5,LOVE THIS BOOK/SERIES,I purchased the series because all the gals at work were raving about it. The books are sooo good. Looking forward to the movie!!
3,Fun Read,"Page turner, but frustrating. You always want to shake her and say ""Use your words"" when it comes with her dealings with her husband."
3,hard to get in to the book,I have read other books by this author (Something Borrowed and Something Blue) and loved them. This book has a very slow start. I got about 40% done and quit reading.
3,Not so much :(,"I dont know what it was about this book, but i just didnt enjoy it as much as something blue or something borrowed. The story just seemed slow and stupid, but the ending was sweet and happy of course. The book was just so typical...but i definitely recommend something borrowed and something blue..i think the characters in those books are more developed and the characters are more heartywarming and hilarious."
3,Not her best,"I really liked Something Borrowed and Something Blue so I was very excited about getting my hands on this book.I felt like this story fell short of my expectations. The book was VERY slow moving - too much relaying of what had happened in the past, with her family, etc - that I almost gave up!, but I stuck with it, and about halfway through things picked up and became interesting. It was rough though.The plot was simple (no problem with that), but it was also a little predictable. I really didn't want the ending to turn out like it did because it was a little obvious, but I'm thankful that some twists and turns were thrown in along the way.Finally, I didn't like the way in which divorce was addressed; I don't think it was necessary to speak of it so lightly."
2,Very Disappointing!!!!!,"I REALLY enjoyed Giffin's other 2 books. I recommend them highly.This book, however, was boring. Typically, in Giffin's other books her characters and stories, both, are very interesting, and keep the reader entertained. This story is about a woman who does not want kids. She gets married, and still doesn't want kids. The story goes on and on and on about her not wanting kids. All of a sudden her husband, does want kids. What to do now? More chapters about Claudia, the wife, not wanting kids. Every character in the story has some connection to wanting, or trying to have children. But, Claudia doesn't want children, as the author reminds us (over and over). Did I mention she doesn't want kids? It gets redundent. None of the characters in this story are interesting. I found myself not really caring about what happens. I found the ending to be predictable. It was a strain to finish the book.So unlike her first 2 books. Save your money on this one. Zzzzzz."
1,One of the worst I've read in a while,"I have read all of Emily Giffin's books and it seems they have gotten progressively less interesting. I was so bored by the middle of this one that I put it down. If I want to read something this shallow, I would watch a Lifetime movie....."
5,"Intelligent ""Chick Lit""","The title of this review is not a slam on ""Chick Lit"" books; they're just not my cup of tea and I don't normallly read them. But ""Baby Proof"" is a really smart, insightful book that has something to say about the choice many women (and men) must make. What can I say that hasn't already been said by other reviewers, so I'll just give it an A. As a side note to readers who have also enjoyed Giffin's ""Something Borrowed"" and ""Something Blue,"" it was a treat to see Ethan and Darcy from those two books made a brief appearance in ""Baby Proof."""
3,Sweet But Predictable,"Having read her first two best-sellers, I expected this book to be great if not better than the other two. However, I found myself extremely disappointed when I was easily able to predict the happy ending half-way through (maybe not even). There were certain parts where it was obvious what the main character had misinterpreted and what had REALLY happened, along with who was eventually going to end up with whom. Although the ending had a nice touch of sweetness, and it was a good page-turner (2 days), I much rather preferred reading Something Borrowed or Something Blue."
4,Battle,"A couple gets married with no intention of having children. After a year the husband's friend has a child and the husband thinks he might like to be a dad. The wife says no thank you, so, they get divorced.He finds a gal and so the ex-wife cyber-stalks him,then she hooks-up with a co-worker as she works at a publishing house. Come to find out, the gal the ex-husband is with is like a personal trainer. They decide to get back together and see how things will go.If this is a look inside a woman's head, it is pretty scary in there."
4,All of Emily Giffin's books are great!,All of Emily Giffin's books are amazing. I did not find this one quite as captivating as the first two but still a good read.
2,So predictable,This book is so cheezy and predictable. The only thing that is somewhat redeeming about it is that it is a quick read...if you can stomach the cliches.
2,"JUST OK, NOT GREAT","This book was just OK. I loved Something Borrowed & Something Blue. I got through those in a day. This one was so redundant and boring that it took me two weeks and that's because I had trouble picking it up again. I simply didn't care about the characters. Within the first couple chapters, the marriage had gone from great to divorce. One fight and it was all over. This was so implausible. The ending was even more implausible. Honestly, if I didn't like Something B, Something B so much, I would have given this 1 star."
2,Baby Proof,"Unfortunately, I found Emily Giffin's ""Baby Proof"" convoluted and rather boring. I'm not saying it might be boring to everyone - just me. I was so in love with Emily's ""Something Borrowed"" and ""Something Blue"" novels. I just felt ""Baby Proof"" should have had an interesting ensemble cast as in the other two novels."
2,Not my favorite from Emily Giffin,This isn't Emily Giffin's best work as she has a protagonist who is very unlikeable. I lost interest with her a quarter into the story and I was not rooting for her at all.Full review:(...)
2,Interesting Idea . . . But Predictable and Poorly Executed,"I wanted to love this book and was intrigued by the topic: a married couple who agrees they do not want kids, but the husband renegs on the agreement. The story that follows, however, is pretty predictable and the dialogue between characters is unrealistic - mostly consisting of one liner-speak that is too simple and glib considering the topic. I wanted to like - and even root for - Claudia, but, most of the time, I found her immature and grating."
5,Chick Lit's Gold Standard,"Emily Giffin consistently turns out books that take chick lit to a higher level of quality and intelligence. The pages turn, and the writing details deeply feminine concerns, but she doesn't wallow in silly stuff like shoes, cocktails, or waiting for mister right...SO GOOD! Liked this book best of all, and eagerly await more from this talented woman."
3,Disappointed...,"First off, let me say that I highly recommend and I totally LOVED both of Emily Giffin's first two books, Something Borrowed and Something Blue. And I had marked Baby Proof as a definite ""must read"" and have been waiting and waiting for it. However, I was terribly disappointed. With the very brief cameo of Ethan late in the book, the characters were unfamiliar, and even worse, unsympathetic (except for Ben, who I would have like to have seen more). Don't start reading Emily Giffin with this book - nor should you judge her by this book. Please read her first two books...and let's all hope that Number 4 is more in the vein of Numbers 1 & 2. Emily Giffin is a talented, easy-to-read writer...one of my favorites. Sadly, this book is not the showcase for that talent!"
4,Good Book!,"I could not wait for this book to come out because I loved the first two books - ""Something Borrowed"" and ""Something Blue"". This book was not as good as the first two although I did enjoy it. I guess I was expecting a little more out of the author. I still would recommend this book to people who enjoy Emily Giffin."
3,"Love her writing , story was ok","Something about Emily Giffin's writing just sucks you in immediately, I find myself hard-pressed to stop reading when it is such fast, easy, reading that you feel you are truly living the story, not reading it. Adored Something Borrowed & Something Blue. Baby Proof kept me entertained throughout, and again still love the writing style, but overall the story did not quite impress me as much as I'd hoped, it was somewhat predictable."
4,Well....Giffin does know how to write.,"If you have read Giffin's first two novels, ""Something Borrowed"" and ""Someting Blue"" you might, as I did, rush to immediately read her newest novel, Baby Proof. And I can't say it wasnt a good read. It was. However, I can't give it the 5 stars I would give to the first two for the following reasons: It was a little drawn out and also predictable, as one would expect a typic Hollywood movie to be. Except for the fact that the Narrator doesnt want kids (which is actually unusual), it doesnt have quite the fresh unique slant, and fantastic characters that her first two novels had. That being said, Emily Giffin is indeed a good writer. You won't want to stop reading until you find out what happens -- even though you've already predicted it."
2,Disappointing,"Claudia Parr is a woman who you come to respect in the first 100 some-odd pages of this book.I quickly lost that respect when my reading came to an end.The series of events goes somewhat like this... ( don't read this review if you'd like to avoid spoilers! )Woman doesn't want baby. Husband decides he does,Woman stands her ground, while Husband becomes an absolute dick, completely unwavering.They divorce FAST.....too fast!Woman tries to move on, yaddayaddayadda, comes to the conclusion that 35 is ""too old to start over"", so she begins to mentally convince herself that she would be willing to have a baby to win Husband back.What started off as refreshing thoughts, with moments that had me cheering this couple on...became yet another cowardly cop out that gave in to the cultural norms."
3,To put it best... I am left unsatisfied,"I read Something Borrowed in no time & Something Blue in even less time... needless to say I have been waiting ever so impatiently for Baby Proof (was a click away from ordering on international Amazon to get a head start). To put it best I am left unsatisfied. Nothing against the topic, I actually can actually identify with many of the feelings brought about in the book but something about Claudia's personality was much less contagious than Rachel or Darcy... perhaps simply because the nature of this issue is carries more depth. I am still most definitely a Giffin fan, LOVED her first two and without hesitation recommend this author to anyone and everyone. Have high expectations for the next book!"
2,Somewhat Let Down,"I was very excited when this book came out. I am a new Emily Giffin reader and have already read and re-read her 1st two. They were excellent and I couldn't put them down. This one, however, is one of the slowest books and I find it very hard to get into. There doesn't seem to be the big climax like her previous two."
2,A Real Disappointment,"While I really enjoyed this author's first two books, I found this one to be an utter disappointment. The main character was difficult to sympathize with given her self-involvement and conceit. At one point I was hoping the plot wasn't going where I knew it was headed because I was actually rooting against her. It is worth noting that I did not dislike her because of her desire to remain childfree. This is a decision I have a lot of respect for because it goes against social norms and the fact that overpopulation is tied to many of the world's current woes. Put simply, Claudia wasn't someone you would want to spend an evening with in real life, so why spend several of them reading about her?"
3,Least favorite of the Giffin books,I have really enjoyed all the books that I've read by Emiy Giffen - but this one I didn't care for. Maybe because I disagreed with the main character so much. Her logic didn't make sense to me and I didn't really believe the story line.
2,"Interesting enough, but...","This book is not surprisingly predictable and nothing really happens. The writer is actually quite good at first person narration, so it holds your interest enough, but it doesn't really go anywhere."
2,predictable,"Baby Proof had a predictable and lack luster ending, as well as annoying characters. Not one of her best books. I loved Something Borrowed and Something Blue but was disappointed with this one."
3,Meh...,"I was really excited to read another Giffin novel, but now I'm not sure about reading another. The ""Something ..."" books really sucked me into the drama, and I felt a mix of hate and love for the main characters. Claudia in ""Baby Proof"" seemed mundane, and a little too typical. Perhaps I just couldn't relate to the main character, Claudia. Since I really enjoyed Emily Giffen's other books, I kept reading through the book, hoping it would get better, and just when I felt it was getting interesting, it ended with a poof. In short, the book left me wishing for more."
3,Somewhat disappointing.,"While I had high hopes for my first Emily Giffin read, I was left disappointed. I just didn't care for the main character, Claudia. It took me a while to put my finger on it, but she had an arrogance that made her unlikeable. I liked the fact that Giffin was tackling the subject of choosing to remain childless; however, Baby Proof ultimately seemed to sell out and challenge the idea that one can be childless and happy.The bulk (300 pages or so) of the novel centers around Claudia, her sisters', and her friend's relationship difficulties, yet Giffin tries to shove tidy, happy endings for all of the characters into the last twenty pages or so. The abrupt ending actually made it feel forced and unrealistic.I am not giving up on Giffin's books based on this one so-so read. Despite the main character's likability issues and the flimsy ending, I found her writing style to be witty and engaging, and I'll give her books another try."
3,Not what I expected either,"I absolutely adored Something Borrowed and Something Blue, so I thought this one would be just as good. Obviously (based on the fabulous reviews), my opinion is in the minority, but I just COULD NOT get into this book. It just seemed to drag on in my opinion, so I skimmed through a lot of it. I would have liked to read more of Ben as well. I did like, however, the brief cameo of Ethan and Darcy - that was a pleasant surprise! Other than that, I just can't really recommend this book. I give it 3 stars because the writing is well done and it is Emily Giffin (whom I love)."
3,Not as good as her other two novels,"In Baby Proof, Claudia Parr, an editor at a major New York publishing house, marries Ben Davenport. Their relationship is perfect in that they have nearly everything in common, including never wanting to have children. But then things change and Ben finds himself wanting children. The division leads to Claudia and Ben's divorce. But even though Claudia seems to move on with her life, she remains in love with Ben.Emily Giffin is adept at writing about people's emotions, and she does so skillfully in this novel. However, I thought some of the characters could have been fleshed out more, especially Ben. And I thought the ending of the book was kind of a cop-out. But Giffin is an excellent writer of ""thinking"" chick lit, and I look forward to reading what she writes next."
1,Narrator for the Audio book is awful!,"Due to a long commute I have been using audio books to make the drive more pleasurable. So I was looking forward to this book as I have heard nothign but good things about Giffin's books, however I was unable to get past the terrible narrator. She has a weird, uppity, rebotic way of speaking (like a lady imitating Thurston Howell)making it impossible to relate to the character. Considering Claudia's stance on children, which I have no problem relating to, it turns the main character into a completely unlikeable person and impossible for me to listen to."
2,Lacking in excitement,"I loved Something Borrowed and Something Blue by Emily Griffin, but Baby Proof just seemed to lack excitement and climax."
3,still fun - but a little disappointed,"I LOVED Giffin's first two books, and I was a little disappointed that Baby Proof didn't use the same characters. I thought the book had an interesting premise - what happens when two people getting married decide not to have children, and then one of them changes his/her mind - but the book didn't explore the possibilites or go into the details of their decisions enough. Giffin's other two books were the ""can't put me down until it's over"" type, and this one just wasn't that exciting for me. I didn't mind reading it, but it just wasn't great. My bookclub read it and most of the members didn't like it that much either. Would still buy her next book though. Hope it is more similar to the writing in the first two."
4,Baby Proof - Great,This book is very entertaining to say the least. A good way to laugh at every day life :)
3,"Good story, frustrating narrator (book on CD review)","I am listening to this book on CD as I drive back and forth on a long commute. I am really into the story, eager to hear what happens at each turn, but unfortunately it's frustrating because the reader is not very good. She uses a strange leering voice for all male characters regardless of situation, and affects an odd tone for many of the female characters. I've heard several other books on CD and this is the first time I've been so distracted by the narrator."
1,Boring,"I loved ""Something Borrowed"" and ""Something Blue"" so I had high hopes for this book. I really had to force myself to get through this book. I thought too much of the focus was put on the secondary characters and by the end of the book I didn't really care about what happened to Claudia and Ben. Jess was the best character and it seemed like she should have been the focus of the story. I think it would have been more interesting had Claudia actually gotten pregnant in the book and reading about how she went through all the pregnancy milestones as someone not naturally wanting to be a mom. The book was a real disappointment. I had to force myself to get through it. I never leave a book unfinished, but this one was close."
3,Not what I was expecting,"I loved Something Borrowed and Something Blue, and I was expecting that I would love this book as well. I really didn't. It was good writing, and had some interesting characters (especially Claudia's sisters), but overall it read as if there was no real plot. Throughout the book, Claudia constantly obsesses over whether or not she's done the right thing, made the right decision, and that can get old. Also, I felt as if the author were posing a question (Will she or won't she have a baby?) that was never satisfactorily answered. After considering putting the book down halfway through, wanting to know the answer to that question was why I continued. Overall, this book was a disappointment to me."
4,Fast read,I could not put the book down.. when 1 chapter would end I would find myself beginning the next one.
5,Page turner...rather...finger slider,"This is the first book I read on my new Kindle Fire...I had to read it in pieces so I wouldn't spend hours. It was EXCELLENT! I really enjoyed Giffin's style of writing and how I actually felt like I was living the story and watching it unfold in front of me. I felt close to the characters, somehow, and it was the most wonderful connection. I am the type of reader that you have to grab my attention right off the bat or else you just sit on the shelf and collect dust. Baby Proof was unlike any book I have ever read before and I absolutely loved it. I was sad when it ended and I slid my finger across the screen and saw the Acknowledgement section :( It has soul. It has love. It pulls at your heart!"
3,its alright,"For some reason, I've always liked chick literature, especially emily giffin. I've liked something borrowed, something blue, heart of the matter no matter how fairytale perfect the endings seemed to be. this book I'm not too sure of. The narrator annoyed me by seeming kind of immature from the start even though she was supposed to be a woman in her early thirties she came across as a silly teenager most of the book. Her train of thought while maybe accurate in the midst of a breakup just irked me as I read the book. She gives detailed descriptions on everything, which sometimes is informative , other times just mundane because the description includes some boring event in another boring persons life which maybe didn't need to be mentioned because it didnt seem relevant. But I kept reading with a fury until I finished. I dont really know why"
3,Cute but not my favorite of hers,I love Griffin's writing and I seem to breeze through her books in about a day or two. Her characters are so real and down-to-earth I feel like I am reading about my friends and real life situations. This book was cute but the ending was very predictable and she did not really bring a conclusion to the big problem in the book - whether the protagonist will have a baby or not. I enjoyed this but not as much as Something Borrowed or Something Blue.
4,Good summer time read,"This was a good book to read while sitting by the pool. I did find it very predictable, but fun. Would like to know what happens in the next stage of the book. Does anyone know if there is a sequel? I would suggest for a good summer time read."
3,Disappointed,"Giffin is a gifted writer, and I've enjoyed her two previous books. This one, however, was disappointing. I didn't think the heroine was likeable. Giffin tries hard to make the reader understand the rationale behind Claudia's decision not to have children. I could understand and accept her reasoning, but she still wasn't a sympathetic character. It's too bad. I so wanted to like this novel. Here's hoping Giffin writes more books like her first two."
2,Somewhat Disappointed...,"I've read Emily Giffin's two other novels (Something Borrowed/Something Blue) and I have to say that this one was not as enticing compared to the other two. The book didn't keep my attention like the other novels, I think because the ending was too predictable. In the middle of the book I already knew the outcome and I felt like I was forcing myself to finish the book to the no surprise ending.Maybe this book was dull because her other books referenced to each other, however this one really had no reference to her previous books. I'm going to try her last novel... I hope the next one is better than this one."
3,Other books were much better...,"I read this book right after I finished the first two, Something Borrowed and Something Blue. I found the book to be interesting but definitely not as strong as her others. I laughed aloud a few times but I found the ending to be quite predictable and boring. So, I thought it was a decent read, but not as thought provoking as the first two."
2,Not new! Seller lied!,"I'm not a snob or anything but if you advertise as New, it should be just that. Some pages were already dog-eared and the cover looked a little worn. The book is amazing, the writer is fantastic. Just don't lie about the condition. I probably still would have bought it and this review would be going much better."
4,"good, easy, fun read","Love this author. This story was no exception. Very fast moving, at times I think it moved a bit too fast but definitely kept my interest throughout."
5,Much more intelligent than I expected,"I actually really liked this book. I bought it expecting fluffy chick lit that I could read on the beach and not think twice about. Meaning, I didn't have high expectations. The book pleasantly surprised me. It's an easy read, but it's very thought-provoking and has a lot of insight for a chick-lit type of fiction book. As a woman who is almost 30 and on the cusp of considering children, the issues in the book were very relevant to me. I loved the way the author used different characters to represent different perspectives women have about marriage and children.Overall, this book was an enjoyable read. There is a lot of talk about babies and pregnancy in the book, so if you're not into that, you probably won't like it very much. I found it to be a very engaging and honest take on how modern women deal with the choices involved when it comes to motherhood and marriage."
4,Much better than Something Borrowed,"I had sworn off this author after reading ""Something Borrowed"" which I still believe to be one of the worst books I've ever read. I got this book as a gift and read it out of boredom. I am glad I did. She balances the characters much better, and the themes really struck a chord with me. It's thought provoking but still a fun and easy read. As with the other books, there are a lot of unnecessary details that are annoying but overall I liked it."
2,Made the short list,"This book made the very short list of books I did not finish. I enjoyed ""Something Borrowed"" even though the gratitious profanity was somewhat offensive. The next book ""Something Blue"" was less credible and this third is just plain boring. I grew weary of the endless self-absorbed ruminations and found myself wishing the ""heroine"" would see her doctor for some medication. The heaviest lite reading I've seen in a long while."
1,"modern welding ""paperback"" version","I purchased Modern Welding- the ""paperback"" version, used off of Amazon, however, when it arrived today I was dismayed to discover that the ""paperback"" edtion is a Lab Manual, that is, a quiz that accompanies the text book. Well, I am out some cash and back at square one- I still need a copy of Modern Welding, too bad Amzon did not state that there is no Paperback version of Modern Welding."
2,Not great!,"I didn't love this one. It was hard to use, and the blonde color is light, my highlighted dark blonde is too dark for it, does not match well. Wouldn't buy again. Cute idea."
1,Not satisfied,"The braided pony wrap did not work well at all. It looks very nice in the packaging, but once I wrapped it in my hair, I could see the pony-tail holder part showing and also the plastic caps which attach the braided hair to the pony-tail holder. It did not look at all like it did on the picture on the package or on the website."
1,Not What I Expected...,"What I received is NOT what I orderd. I ordered the emerald Winterberry salad plates in time for a Christmas delivery. The box arrived on time. I was so excited to unpack the dishes until I noticed that they did not send me the solid green salad plates but they sent the white plates with the berries. I was never told they were out of the green plates, if I had, I never would have placed the order.I called right away to receive a credit for the order including the shipping cost. They appologized and said they would send a shipping label in the the next week for returning the substituted salad plates. That was a month ago, nothing has happened...I still have the white Winterberry dishes in a box ready to be sent back.In my opinion this company has poor customer service. I would be very leary about ordering something...you never know if the package comes and it is Not What You Expected."
4,Charlie Rose Interview,"This book is meant to accompany a documentary, and when I saw the director and two of the combat artists on Charlie Rose (5/19/00?), they showed several of the drawings from the book, and they were pretty amazing.I think it's true that we think of WWII as primarily a photographer's war, but some of these paintings give a new feeling (one driven by an artist's emotion) to the war that isn't quite the same as through photography.Even though I only saw a few of the paintings on the interview, it was enough for me to plan to buy the book."
1,I Thought I Was Good,"I played JR. in ""Deep Jaws."" I'm glad this is coming out on DVD, because it's nice to have a film I was in come out on DVD - but I can't honestly say I can imagine anyone thinking this is a good film. Now if only someone would release the other cinematic materpiece I was in - ""Meateater"" - which was NOT a porn film."
3,Love the contents but...,"...the presentation of the of the project comes across very badly. There are numerous typos on the DVD menus and even stranger is that the my TV chops off the edges of the DVD menu so it makes hard to see the text on the extreme right side of the menu. Overall this comes off as a very amateur effort with no real care put into it. great idea marred by poor execution.Now the real reason to get this set if for the wealth of Abbott & Costello material contained within, A & C once again prove why they are funnier than most of the so called funny guys of today, and they do all this while being family friendly.If you do get this set, don't get it for the blooper reel which is not really funny and barely be called a ""blooper reel"" most of the bloopers just seem like unused takes and nothing really funny."
4,Opened my eyes,"I have been working with children for a long time and this book really opened my eyes. I need good reason to change my way of thinking and Stan Davis has given me that. In addition to making some very good points, he has seen this method be successful at numerous schools. I would recommend the book to anyone that works with groups of children."
5,Wonderful book.,"I read this to my kid quite frequently. I'm almost 30 and I think I enjoy it more than she does.There's just something about it that I really like, but I can't pinpoint it."
3,"gets the job done, but tears and breaks easily","Within a week of daily use of this product, I noticed a difference in the build up of tartar on my teeth. That yellow coloration between my teeth has all but disappeared. After a few days of regular use, the hard crusty material easily chips off. Using this floss can be very frustrating however, particularly for people who don't floss regularly. One must be very patient when using it because it breaks easier than conventional floss."
4,Great book,You'll enjoy this book if you're interested in history and the outdoors. I think you'd like it whether you're a native Oregonian or a newcomer.
5,A Travel Essential,"I bought the Benchmark Utah road atlas on the strength of the reviews written for atlases produced by this company for other states, and am glad I did. This is an attractive volume, and I like the shading that gives the user a real sense of the terrain. From my admitedly limited experience, the roads and natural and cultural features seem to be accurately mapped, and this atlas was definitely useful in helping us find our way along the unimproved roads outside of Moab. Highly recommeded for those planning a serious road trip in Utah."
3,Cloud 9? more like a 7,"This pen is too light for its look, and the soft cushion is too sticky for convenience.I tried the old Sensa pens and liked them well, but hey - this one just doesn't cut it."
3,good to use but the plastic is not so wonderful,The using time is long enough. The sound isn't so good as they advertized. I can not pair the headset to my phone and my laptop at the same time. The material is not so good.
4,Bluetooth Heaven,When my company purchased my new phone they forgot that it needed a bluetooth headset. Needless to say I panicked but turned to Amazaon.com and found this Bluetooth Headset at a price that was remarkably below most stores. The product works perfectly with my phone and it was so easy to get it in sync with my phone. With new laws about cell phone use while driving in NJ I can stay on the road and use my phone. It is a great bargain and very reliable
1,"I can you hear you, but you can't hear me","I initially thought this was working great, but then I tried to talk to someone. They could understand any of the words said through the unit, so I would have to hang it up and talk through the phone directly instead. As always, an easy return via Amazon."
2,Motorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset :-(,"I think the headset itself is great, but the battery life for this unit is horrible. I had only used my headset for approx 1 1/2 hours and it went completely dead. I do like the design, but my overall opinion of the headset is ok."
2,Not as good as I would have liked,The volume could be better and after pairing with my Nokia 6600 it worked pretty good. But I am unable to pair with any other device. It is ok for some people. But I found not worth the purchase price
3,Meh..... :-(,Try ed to get it to work with my razor and would not sync so i returned it....don't know if it was defective or not?
4,A pretty good device,"I do like the ease of using the headset, but the voice recognition often can't recognize what you are saying. Also, if you type in a number manually, it will drop you off the headset and you need to reconnect. It is easy to hear and clear."
2,Loose Fit - Hard to hear...,"Fits loosley on my ear, dangles a bit. Hard to hear while driving and walking. Must be sitting. I was very disapointed."
1,no fidelity no comfort,cant hear (not loud enough) hurts the ear if you wear it for more than a few minutes yet falls off if you move your head too quickly
3,Cool design but inadequate sound in noisy areas,"Liked the overall design but in noisy areas like airports or outside in busy areas, I found it very difficult to hear. Returned and bought the Jabra BT250v instead."
1,Infuriating,"One of the most worthless items I've ever had. No troubleshooting information in the manual. Works when it wants as opposed to when I want. Charge doesn't seem to last a day without any use. Whoever thought a blue flashing light on your ear was stylish should get a lobotomy. It's worked twice in three weeks and instead of answering the last call, it just beeped incessantly.I think I'll give up on bluetooth. And I'll certainly have nomo Moto!One star because Amazon will not let me give it a lower vote."
3,bluetooth,I like everything about the bluetooth except when you push the button to answer or end a call. It seems to push a little to much into your ear. I have tried both ears and it does it on both sides. Otherwise its fine.
2,no volume,This head set works great in the home but in the car where you need it you cannot here. The volume only goes so high. I end up pushing it to my ear.Also it comes in a ziplock not new package so it looks used.
3,Hit or Miss,"I have an HS850 headset and it has always worked okay for me. When my boyfriend needed a new headset, I recommended this one. His worked only about half the time. Sometimes he could hear me; sometimes he couldn't. So he went out and bought another one (same kind). This one worked fine, and is still working after 3 months. The advantage to us both using the same kind is that the static storms I used to hear with his other headset are gone. Also, I can make as much noise as I want and he doesn't complain about it being too loud, as he did with the old set he had. Bottom line: This set works good, when it works."
4,Pretty good for the price,"I've had my HS850 for about three weeks and only use it while I am driving. I have a Samsung T-629 and setting it up was a snap and took about five seconds. The volume is pretty decent and the parties on the other end never have problems hearing me. Since I only use it when I drive (about 45 mins a day) I cannot give an accurate assesment on battery life, but I can say I have not had to recharge it since I started using it. It is small, lightweight, comfortable, and easy to use. Using some functions might take a little practice since there is only one button that does everything. I only wish that it would be more stable on the ear. It feels like it is about to fall off when I turn my head, but it actually stays on the ear pretty well. Overall, it is a great little device for the price. Would definitely buy it again."
1,Bought New; Received Used,"I returned this product because it was clearly a used headset. There were scratches on the front, and a small dent. Frankly I do not want to insert a used product into my ear. I went to Wal-mart and bought the very same product for less money."
4,Nice Blutooth,Reception is good. connects with my moto V551 fast.Nice look. batterry life in long. But sometime feels its gonna fall off because of too thin ear holder.
4,Almost Perfect,"This headset has much to recommend it - comfortable, easy to use, clear sound. The only ""minus"" is a problem with voice activation - it consistently misunderstands spoken dialing instruction, so I have to dial manually."
1,Motorola Bluetooth HS850,"I was not impressed with this bluetooth, it was hard to hear through ear piece even at top volume, and people recieving stated it sounded as if I was talking into a tin can. I ended up giving it away and buying a Plantronics 665 with digital enhanced signal."
5,Best of the Bunch,"I love this headset; I have used it with two phones. Works flawlessly and is simply perfect. I highly recommend it, for battery life, dependability, and simple easy to use. Settle for no less than this headset.PP"
4,Motorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset,"The wireless headset is definitely much more convenient and less of a distraction than either a wired headset or speaking directly into a hand-held device. The volume can be insufficient at times, and a weak signal annoying. Overall, I recommend this Bluetooth headset--- it's easy to use and I enjoy the added freedom."
4,Not The Strongest Signal,"I have two of these boomsets but find you need to have the cellular telephone pretty near the boomset for it to work quietly. For my wife, her mother says she always hears an echo, and for me there is a bit of a hiss when the units aren't very very close. I attribute this to the low-power nature of a small, rechargable device. My car bluetooth does NOT exhibit the same tendencies."
2,Poor quality but good sound,"I received this as a Christmas gift last year, it was fabulous until it started falling apart. First the rubber ear padding started tearing, so I finally just popped the whole thing off (they don't sell replacement parts for this, unlike other brands). Then I started noticing it was losing signal to the phone if it wasn't fully charged all the time. It doesn't allow you to move 30 feet away from the phone like it says it does, it's more like 10-15 feet. It's progressively gotten worse with dropping calls and falling apart, now the microphone on it isn't working at all. Workmanship is horrible. Caller on the other end says it's good sound, hard to tell i'm on a headset at all. Buy at your own risk."
4,HS850? Yes! Still getting Used To Wearing....,"I am still getting used to wearing this earpiece, but other than a little bouncing-movement, awareness that it is there when I'm walking at a brisk pace and learning how to syncronize it's use w/ my new Motorola E815 Bluetooth Phone, I'd give it 5 stars....Great not to have to lift my shoulder anymore. My Chiropractor Gives it 6 stars, and he doesn't own one! (Yet). Love not having to program each contact ph. number to anything, as the phone improvement takes care of that. I learned it's awkward trying to verbally dial a call while standing in line at the checkout counter at Albertson's, but ya gotta learn protocal somewhere, eh? Yep! Good piece of Techn here! Go for it!"
3,"Fast connection, but gets uncomfortable after a while","Functionality wise this bluetooth headset is built well, it takes about 1.5 seconds to connect to the phone and the voice continues without gap from handset to headset. Volumn control buttons are a little bit too small but you can use the control on your phone instead.It feels light at first but after 30 minutes it gets uncomfortable as the clip presses against your ear."
2,Why Bother,"Okay, I will put this the nicest way I can. The head set is of an excellent build quality, but when I had it on my ear, it kept feeling like it was about to fall off. That, I could get use to, but there is one more problem with it that can't be overlooked. The volume on the device is awful. If you are always in a room with no background noise then this headset is excellent. But, if you are planning on using this in the office, out in public, while driving, or while doing any sort of living, then you may want to consider something else. I am having to return it because I am just so unsatisfied with the device."
2,"Nice toy- but not a workhorse, and isn't an all-use bluetooth appliance, it only works on phones!","Bought the unit, the other reviewer who has mentioned how the headset feels on the ear is correct- not designed to feel comfortable, always seems to want to fall off. Really a deal breaker- don't buy it unless you're Dumbo.Also, bought this one thinking it was a useful bluetooth item to save having multiple headset devices- mainly one for my cellphone and one for my bluetooth-enabled laptop voip connection on SKYPE. You'd (be lead to) think a bluetooth appliance is good for many things- this one won't work as my headset for voip, only works on my phone. Wish that there was someone trying to think ahead of the consumer that needs an all in one bluetooth headset device like I need.But I am returning this unit- I don't feel like getting a lanyard ( just to keep the thing from hitting the ground all the time) and looking like a geeked-out phy ed teacher"
4,Expected quality.,"Overall a great product with a fair price. I have had absolutely no problems with the product except for the volume level, which is *NOT* below standard, it is just simply what is to be expected from a headset.Very comfortable, and I personally prefer the boom mic to be longer (unlike the newer models of this headset which have shortened mics).Recommended."
2,disappointed,"I ordered mine and it doesn't seem to keep a charge well. I don't use it and it still loses its charge after 2 or 3 days. The sound quality is ok, but it feels like it is going to fall off so I have to reach up and secure it better often. I lost a call once and had to wait till I stopped driving to begin my call again. (my cell signal was good so I don't think it was my phone.)"
3,solid all around,"It's light weight, it charges fast, it's appealing to the eye and somewhat easy to use. Compatible with all bluetooth devices (including PS3). Price was right on the money too: it was half of what I was seeing in retail stores."
3,Easy to use but not so good sound.,"When it comes to headsets, the sound quality is the bottom line for me. I'm sorry to say that this one doesn't have it. I found the function excellent and especially liked the folding boom mike. The fit was a bit loose but not a huge problem. The big issue for me was the muffled sound, both for me and the caller. The other problem is that in a noisy environment holding a conversation became a real problem. I have tested 8 different headsets by pairing two of them at a time, putting one in each ear, and switching between them during a call. This lets me and the caller make a reasonable comparison of sound quality. Only one of the other 7 I tested did worse. (I also tested the Motorola H700 and found it to have the same pros and cons as this one.)"
2,Not what I expected from Motorola,"I have to say that this was a big disappointment. This is my first bluetooth headset and if this is the way they all are .. its not for me. It seems to be fine for me and I am able to hear people very clearly but others say that I am very broken up, almost like a bad speaker phone, where parts of the words are missing. I would think twice before purchasing this item due to this problem. I have a brand new phone and had it checked out and they said it was the headset. It might be just defective or maybe this is normal who knows. I will have to try others to be convinced on this bluetooth technology."
3,Thought it would be better...,"I bought this item as a replacement to my lost bluetooth. Essentially, I thought this device would be an upgrade...apparently not. I had a cheaper model bluetooth from Motorola and I have to say, I enjoyed better reception and better overall functionality. However, the battery life in this unit is superior. Bottom line, not a bad device but more expensive does not always equate to better quality."
3,Headset came with the wrong charger,"I ordered this headset through Amazon, but the item actually came through a third party, tiger direct. The headset was fine but it came with the wrong charger. I called tiger direct and they gave me a RA number, but said that since it was third party, they could not send me a replacement and I had to reorder through Amazon again. I asked them what would prevent them from sending the same item with the wrong charger again? He couldn't answer. So I went to Ebay and bought the charger separate for 5.00 instead of going through the hassle of returning and wondering if I would get the same charger again.....it works fine now! Maybe you should have something in place so that you can be insured of receiving a proper replacement."
1,Short battery life,"I bought this item online. The battery went DEAD within two months. BEWARE, the battery cannot be replaced by the user. You have to return it to Motorola. BIG HASSLE. Why doesn't Motorola make the bluetooth with a user-replaceable battery? Doesn't make sense to me..."
2,Not for Treo 650,"Bottom line: not convenient but wireless indeedfor the treo 650 users out there, you might want to skip out on this one.The HS850 does not take on voice dialing (a major bummer) and the HS850 also does not connect to your treo after placing an outgoing call; instead the multifunction button must be pressed at the beginning of each outgoing call and this really sucks.too much hands being used.The operational range is very limited considering the higher price and static usually comes about while in a pocket, similar to the $30.00 boomless in the ear plantronics earpiece.With that being said the plantronics might be better considering the lack of increased utility in the more expensive Motorola HS850."
3,A decent headset,"In short here is what I have experienced with this headset.-design- the headset certainly looks nice on the ear, very compact and is comfortable. However, it does feel loose, as if it is going to fall if you move your head quickly. I must say though it has never fallen so far.-quality of sound- the sound quality is a definitely worse then the one of the wire headsets and max volume is also not very high. When I use the HS850, people I talk to immediately notice the difference in sound quality."
1,In my opinion - don't buy it,"I am a very loyal Motorola customer. All of my cell phones have been Motorola. So, naturally, I bought a Motorola headset when I decided to get a Bluetooth headset.There were several things I didn't like about this headset. First, it changed the ring on my PEBL to the annoying ring you get when you plug the phone in for charging. I had the phone on vibrate but when I bonded with the headset it made the phone ring and not vibrate.The other thing I really disliked was how it felt on my ear. It always felt like it was about to fall off at any momment. The loop on it never made it feel secure.I punted this headset in favor of the Plantronics 665 and am much happier with that headset."
1,CRAP!,"Bought this for 100 clams at Best Buy. If Unit is more than 1 foot away from your ear- complete STATIC. Yeah, and also other party can not hear you outside. If you like to talk to someone feeling like you're in a war zone- STATIC over the Line and Unable to hear the other party then this is the the Motorola for you. How they get this junk on the market and then get people to buy it and like it is beyond me."
1,Don't bother,"Firstly, I paid around $80 for the headset which is sloppy (loose) with no way to adjust to tighten for snug fit. I've had many complaints of an echo on the side of the listener. It needs to be charged frequently & it's just a poor quality product all around. The only plus is the fold-up boom to answer or end a call."
4,very good,Is what I expected and works great. Stays charged for long time on stand by and while in take mode.
2,Get the 730 Model,"I lost my old headset and thought ok I will replace it with a newer model. Big mistake. There is no tone to let you know that the set is operating, the person that I call can hear me just fine, but I have trouble hearing them (no I do not have hearing problems)even with the volume turned all the way up. There is a very short warning, three beeps, that the battery is low, but it sounds just like an incoming call which confused me."
1,Motorola HS850 Very Disappointing,"I have been unable to ""pair"" this device with my Motorola Razr phone and my husband's Samsung A900. I have followed the directions and repeated each step of the process several times. I am very disappointed with this purchase."
2,Works great but breaks easy,"I've had two of these already and broke both of them. The same problem with both, after about 2 months they quit taking a charge."
5,First time bluetooth user,"Unlike most reviewers here, I don't have anything to compare this headset to because it's my first bluetooth headset. I CAN say that I have no problem hearing my callers and my callers have no problem hearing me. The sound is clear and the volume adequate on both ends. I've never lost the connection with my phone, but my phone is always either on my person or in my purse when I'm using the headset, so I can't really comment on the distance specs.I'm pretty picky by nature but, for my purposes, this headset was the perfect solution. I don't use it in noisy environments or anything. I bought it to use when I'm in the car, outside gardening, or just around the house doing things that I don't want to stop doing just because somebody calls me. For those things, it's the perfect solution for me. No complaints at all."
3,Its ok but not great,I have been using this product for two weeks and it is kind of ok to me. Not a great one and volume is not that proper. Anyways one can use it but might not get full satisfaction.
2,This Bluetooth SUCKS!,"Had this product for a couple of years now. First of all it's bulky, and it doesn't hug your ear, unless you don't have big ears. Also picks up background noises."
1,Not a good product....Not What I expected,"The shipment was expedited, so I am thankfull for that. However, the product itself is not what I expected to be. The volume on the bluetooth is not good at all. You can hardly hear anything. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this item at all. It's an absolute waste of money. However, I would recommend the seller."
5,Works great,"This product works great under the circumstances of my use. I use it inside my house or other buildings with limited noise. I also use it in my convertible with the top up. I have not had good results in areas with high surrounding noise. Also, the price was great; later purchased one for my wife."
3,"Okay, I guess...","This was my first bluetooth headset I have owned. So, with that, I feel for the money, this is worth it. It hurts the ear just a bit, takes a little getting use to. (I have since purchased the platonics in-ear headset which is much more comfortable). The sound is okay, it has to be relatively quiet around you or it is really difficult to hear through the earpiece. Everyone I talk to doesn't even know I am using it, that is a good sign for the voice pickup.I guess if the volume was a little better, I would have given it another star, but it is what it is.The price is good if you are just looking for a headset to use occasionally, but if you are going to use it for a long time, I would recommend a different setup.It stays charged for a couple days (depending on how much I am on the phone...)"
1,Not happy,"It's hard to hear people even at the highest volume, although they can hear me pretty well. The earpiece always swings off my ear when I move my head and I have to re-position it."
2,Worst bluetooth device I've owned yet.,"I am not pleased with this earpiece at all. While it is compact, light, and able to switch between ears, the sound quality on this earpiece is terrible. I had one of a similar model that I loved. I ran over it with my car and it still worked! (but it didn't survive spending the night in a mud puddle- oops) I bought this one expecting the same quality and am sorely disappointed. I have to cut it off within the first few seconds of every conversation because it distorts the sound so badly. I've also had people on the other end tell me that it muffles my voice as well. If you can't hear on it, then what's the point? Try something else."
2,Mot HS850 Bluetooth Headset opinion,"I found the Motorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset did not meet my expectations. The link below identifies the device.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007WWAGI/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgThe product had a shroud on it which I found annoying and after having used the Motorola HS700 Bluetooth Headset for years prior to the purchase of this product I found the power adapter and car adapter lack of compatibility with USB connectors very inconvenient. More and more I find the USB mini-connector charging system is becoming a ubiquitous standard and lack of this compatibility, when I have many other devices using this system makes it cumbersome at best to have to carry around additional car adapters."
3,Pros and Cons,"Pros: lightweight, solid construction, good battery life, easy to set up with a Bluetooth phoneCons: Max volume is way too low, earpiece fit is a bit loose (I'm a 35 yr old male, 6'2"")I suggest anyone looking to purchase this try one on before buying."
2,"Great sometimes, horrible others","I've been using the 850 daily for about a month now and I'm taking it back. When conditions are ideal (I'm within 10 feet of the phone, I have excellent service coverage, and my ear with the 850 on it is toward the phone, no wind, no background noise) it works really well. When any combination of the parenthetical above occurs say goodbye to the clarity on both ends. I'm tiring of my friends saying take that stupid headset off, I'm getting every other syllable. I had high hopes, but the technology's just not there yet. At least not with this headset. I think the long boom headsets are bound to be better. That's what I'm going to try now. Fair warning on this headset. Looks cool, but who cares if it doesn't hold its own?"
3,Not good in noisy areas,I bought this primarily for the car. It is borderline unusable in that noisy environment. If I crack the window I can forget about using this device at all. I drive a convertable so it does have more than average noise in the cabin but I would expect better filtering.
2,Battery life ~40 mins for mine,"I probably got a defective HS850, but its battery life is really short. It needs to be recharged even when off (after about 3 days sitting there it's flat), and the talk time is 40 minutes tops. After what I paid for this when it just came out (August '06), I expected far more from a Motorola product. Sound quality and connectivity to my LG CU500 is fine, though. I wish it had a mute button---I'm replacing the headset, and it's one feature I will be looking for."
1,audio too muffled,Audio too muffled by design. Mic presses into face and causes speech to sound muffled. Had to play with ear placement too much. Two family members had same problem with both models we bought. The weight was good and incoming sound was good. Listener's had hard time hearing clearly unless a finger's space was made next to wearer's face.
3,Cheap and simple,Not the best headset I have ever had but not all that bad for the price either. I wish the volume would go higher and wish it held to my ear better. Seems to take some messing with to get it to stay on my ear.
3,HS850 BLUETOOTH,"I love it. The charge lasts for a long time as noted. The only thing, not good to listen to music using this bluetooth. The sound can be static, low and somewhat distorted. Great to hold phone conversations though."
3,At least it folds in half to save power...,"...that way, you don't look like a dorklet walking around all day with blue plastic hanging over your ear. That is a distrubring urban fashion trend that makes you look socially desperate and insecure no matter who you are. It folds up so you can keep it in your pocket and be mindful of where you are and who you are with. Sound quality is passable, and the fit on my ear isn't great, but it is better than most."
1,Defective Units in Bulk Packages,I purchased two (2) of these units. Neither one worked. One had a bad switch and the other had a bad mic. It appeared to me that these bulk units were defective returns because both of the ones I received had scratches like they were already used. Nothing was factory sealed. Stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I sent them back and got a full refund.
1,Was not Satisfied,The clarity was teriable and range was not very good. I would not recomend this model. I had a Motorola HS820 which was twice the unit as the HS850.
1,Only lasted 8 months!,"In the beggining it was ok but now its just a piece of junk. It picks up all background noise and drops calls. My husband drives for a living so he relies on his earpiece alot, but now after less than a year it doesn't work at all. He is really disappointed in it."
1,Poor Quality,"I purchased the HS850 in December 2005. It was non-functional by January, received replacement. Replacement in August 2006 does not hold a charge overnight, hangs up cell randomly and is of extremely poor quality. Customer service at Motorola site non-existent, no response to emails. Extremely poor quality, would never purchase again, difficulties getting a refund."
2,You don't want this,Hey i had this headset but trust me it is not good at all. I drive my car and i can barely hear the person talking when i use it it's comfortable yes i'll give it that but the product sucks. They can hear you but you can't hear them.
3,It goes dead frequently,"It works OK most of time. Compared to my other bluetooth earphone, it is about the same. The only detrimental problem is that from time to time it dies... The only way to revive it is to connect to the charger and it becomes normal. I ended up buying another Plantronics product as a backup."
1,Great...........as long as it's quiet around you,"I've read mixed reviews about this headset on Amazon and other sites. However, when a friend recommended this specific model, I figured I'd give it the benefit of the doubt. Boy was I wrong! As everyone else will tell you, this headset is absolutely HORRIBLE if there is any noise around you (IE: road noise while driving). Therefore, it completely defeats the purpose in my opinion. I'm going to return it and continue to use my wired Sony fontopia-based headset. Yeah, it's not as convenient, but at least I can freakin' hear the person on the other end."
2,Not impressed,"I purchased this item because I liked that it automatically turned off when the microphone flipped in. It didn't fit my ears (guess my ears are too small). My previous cheaper blue tooth was better because it had a piece sticking out to actually fit inside of the ear to secure it better. Needless to say, I do not use this product and it sits on my dresser collecting dust."
3,bluetooth,I bought the product for a christmas gift. I got it 4 days after the purchase was complete. I was very much satisfied with the delivery and everything.
4,Great for the price,The sound quality on both ends of this unit is excellent. It's easy to use even though it takes a little getting used to compared to other Motorola models. The improvement in sound quality more than makes up for the initial adjustment period. Recommend it to all as it compares favorably to some Plantronics models (in fact easier to use than some of the Plantronic boom models).
3,!,"my major problem was that the phone couldn't adjust to my ears since they are small. Also, it took too many steps to connect the device to my phone."
1,Bluetooth,I placed an order for a new bluetooth. I received one in a ziploc - looks like used. I am not using it.I want to receive my order in the original packaging. It is the only way one can tell if it is brand new.Rating - 0
2,"works great, link with up to 8 BT,","i linked with BT USB, dell x50v, sony ericsson t610. (saved in the headset, so no need to re-pair for switching connections)that is great feature.sounds ok, no echos."
4,DOES ANYONE KNOW THE RANGE OF THIS BLUETOOTH?,i'm just wondering if anyone knows the range of this HS850. how far can i be from my cell and still be able to talk/hear clearly?i'd appreciate any respond of anyone who can help! :) thanks!
5,Great Buy,The Motorola HS850 is a great hands free head set. I like that once you link it to your phone it automatically connects once it is opened.
3,So So headset,"There are good things to say about this headset - I especially like the simple on-off switch of the mic boom opening out. That makes it very simple to not leave ""on"" and drain the battery. That said the battery has excellent life.Unfortunately the headset does not fit very well (I am big guy with large ears and it is not snug). Like other motorola headsets I have tried it keeps losing the connection with my Motorola Q phone. The earpiece volume is also not as high as I would like.Ultimately I used it until I found the Plantronics Voyager 510 which is 150% better than this model."
2,Buyer Beware,"I ordered this set directly from Amazon and I received an used set, not an open box but a set that was obviously heavily used, the paint was peeling, extremely dirty, just plain gross. I called customer service and I was told I was going to get a replacement, guess what? the replacement was as used and dirty like the first one. Called customer service again and I was told that it seems to be a widespreed problem and I could only get a refund (after weeks of wasting my time waiting for the headset).If Amazon is aware of the problem why do they keep selling it?"
2,Used (Refurbished) and I was not told!,"This product was refurbished and for the price it was not a good deal. Next time I will pay a little more and get a new headset, even though I thought that this was new..."
2,Not happy with it,I did not like the headset because it was dialing out by itself in the vicinity of my phone. At times it was dialing out even when the boom was folded away. It just seemed to have a mind of its own. However once the connection was made the calls were clear and people at the other end could hear me clearly. Motorola needs to have an on/off switch for this device. I returned the headset. It came in a bulk package(ziplock bag) so maybe because it was refurbished it was not working properly. Either way I ended up returning it.
5,Great Headset,"I had no problem pairing this bluetooth with my Motorola Razr. It also fits well and is comfortable. The sound is clear and the battery last long. Best of all, it is small enough to fit in my pocket easily. The only thing other that I would mention is I bought two of these and one fit on the right ear and one fit on the left. I didn't think this was a big deal, it was just strange. I am going to buy another one for my dad."
2,Great product with one major problem !!!!,"I was very happy with product but BEWARE. I wanted to switch the ear hook from right side to left side. When I did, the earhook at the bottom broke off. I figured this is a common issue and called motorola for a replacement ear hook- I was told they do not make ANY parts for this model!!! I was also told my ONLY option was to buy a whole new bluetooth ! How can this be the only option for a little earhook? I will never purchase a motorola product again with out doing this type of research. Hope this helps you as well."
3,"OK headset, poor charger","OK sound quality on receiving end, friends complain about echo on the other end. Also, charging adapter type not listed, hoped for mini-usb like my cell phone, got 3 prong connector that was tricky to get connected the first time I charged it and still is."
4,The Ache of Modernism,"I resisted joining the masses speaking in to thin air for as long as I could. Then it became apparent that they had a point, and that even if I don't need to spend every second of every day on the phone...it sure is nice to have this sort of flexibility for the times that I do.That being said, I bought the Motorola Bluetooth Headset for use with my Blackberry 8203. Set up was as easy as you can imagine. Instantly usable, after a short charging period, the HS850 has good sound and (I am led to believe) good transmission qualities as well.I imagine there may be better, but for the price, this is a winner. I don't walk around with it on all the time, but when I do use it, I am not uncomfortable. It holds its charge very well, and I think you will be happy with this as an initial purchase."
3,Adequate,"It works. Battery time not great, sound not that great, but you do get used to it being on your ear, and it's not too heavy."
4,Nice headset - on sale at Costco now,"I bought this headset recently because it is currently on sale at Costco at a very good price. I am assuming that Costco's packaging would be considered ""bulk"". My headset is brand new, not a mark on it, and all the others looked the same. It paired up with my LG CU500 with no problems, and I am not tech savvy. The sound quality sounds good to me. As others have said, being able to flip it on and off to save battery life is great, as well as just pushing one button to both answer and end a call. I'm quite happy with it so far. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I haven't used it that much yet."
4,Overall good but not perfect,"The only thing that I can add to the hundreds of reviews already posted here is my own experiences (we ordered 2 of these).Positives:- No earbud going into the ear - this is a BIG positive because I can't stand those and, apparently they are not good for you.- Quick charging.- Easy to pair - in my case with a Razr and a Blackberry.- Easy to turn on/off, by simply folding/unfolding the microphone boom.- Pretty good instructions.Negatives:- My wife complains that the sound quality is not always perfect.- Being as small as it is, perhaps some carrying pouch should have been included.- The charging interface is not a mini-USB but some weird, proprietary plug.- If there is a way to attach this to the left ear, I am not aware of it.At this time, my wife decided to keep hers but she will give the second one to her girlfriend as a birthday present :)"
2,Motorola HS850 Bluetooth,"Way too bulky and the boom is annoying. After pushing the button for voice activation, the sound is delayed for a slight second and so sometimes you only here like ""command"" instead of ""please say a command."" Just not as happy with it as my other one."
1,sounds like i'm on speakerphone...,"well...i mostly got it so that i could talk on the phone while i put on make-up (haven't even tried it in a car yet) but i may as well be on speakerphone for as loud as i have to speak to be heard...hands-free is one thing...but i feel like i'm shouting...so i rarely rarely rarely even try to use it...the one good thing is that it seems to hold a charge for quite a while...UPDATE ON AUG 8, 2009:stopped working entirely. awful piece of junk."
2,hs850 Bluetooth motorola,"extremely disappointed that I could not use any of my existing chargers since this one is different. This is the first one that I know of with a change in chargers.Also, due to only one solid color, I have already lost the earbud. I definitely would not recommend. It was a waste of money for me."
2,You get what you pay for,"Basically, you get what you pay for. This is a $25 bluetooth device and it performs as such. Worked well for a couple of weeks for me before dying for good. Just sent back to Amazon for a refund and didnt bother getting a replacement. My fault for trying to be a cheepskate I guess!"
2,hmmm price too good to be true,"Bought this for $20 on deal of the day. It was the one in the bulk packaging, that might have been the first clue. Didn't sound good in my ear and nobody could hear me on the other end. I had a ""real"" motorola from best buy that really did work. I lost it and tried to replace it with this one. BY the real thing."
1,Beware the Asia version of the HS850,"I bought this HS850 elsewhere, because I lost my previous one. I figured this time I'd get the black model, since it looks cool. Big mistake. Apparently this one is the Asia version. Here are the differences I noticed compared to the American blue/grey HS850:- different packaging- people on the other line told me I sounded muffled- overall cheap/flimsy feel in both the headset and the charger- charger is not UL approved/certified- charge time is much longer to fully chargeAvoid this, be sure to get the American version."
4,Works for me.,"Seems like Bluetooth headsets are a very subjective experience. I have a Treo 700P and I tried a number of different BT headsets before I settled on the HS850. I have no problems pairing with my phone and it fits my ear just fine. What sold me on this particular headset was the outgoing sound quality. My wife, mother, and paralegal all report that this is the best sounding headset I have had. It does a good job of avoiding background noise. I previously had the Jabra JX-10 and despite good reviews from others, I found the outgoing sound quality low when there was any background noise. The only criticism I have of the HS-850 is that the incoming sound could be louder."
1,Many problems,"I would not recommend this device to anyone. For aprox $100 you get a headset that can't be used unless in complete quietude. It also drops its signal frequently. After purchasing a replacement of the same model, I chose the Jabra (I believe the 250 model) and am quite happy with it. It's more sturdy / comfortable, and it performs much better in noisy environments such as airports, cafes, etc."
4,Good Performer!,"I have been using the HS850 for over a year now. It is a very good headset. Here are the pros and cons.Pros:As long as you charge it every nite, the battery lasts a long time (I spend a lot of time on it too!)Clarity is very goodPrice...I've seen it for less than $40 now, which is a bargain.Cons:Occasionally has some staticIt is a little bigger than I would like it to be and prettty noticable. The new H700 is about 1/3 smaller, however I hear it is uncomfortable :(You cannot use it if there is much background noise. i.e. in a dept store NO WAY!By the way, I use mine with a Motorola e815 (great phone and great service with Alltel). I am reluctant to buy anything else because this headset would be tough to beat!"
1,The headset did NOT work.,This headset I bought on May 10th 2006 for $38.00. I charged it up made a phone call and after that the headset did not work.it was sealed and new.This seller eek technologies does not accept returns do BUYER BEWARE. I spent $45 total and all I got was a charger and a broken headset. I would highly receommend Jabra BT 250....thats my next one. DO not buy this. The only call I made had echo on the receiver side.
2,"Nice looking, but would not buy it for looks.","I had this headset for about 5 months, I mean I had 3 of them. All of them had one same problem - super low volume. And it cannot be increased. First one I got I thought it was broken, but when got the replacement, same problem with volume... Two months down the road of very low usage, the main button went bad. Anytime I wanted to start using it, it would redial the same exact number, no matter which number I dialed last. I sent for replacement, got my third one and had same problem with volume. Decided to sell it on eBay. Got myself a brand new model of Jabra - BT500 and love it. Volume is perfect, sits comfortably on my ear, does not fall even if I shake my head, people hear me without any problems and distance is good as well. Charges fast and battery last long."
1,YOU CANNOT REPLACE BATTERY!!!!,"As stated above,its Garbage When Battery Dies on this and similar Motorola models!!! Nice if they told you that when purchasing it. Barely loud enough when in a car. Very light. Signal sometimes ok, sometimes not. I have 3 of these for my family purchased from Motorola (no counterfeit).My opinion: Find a headset with a removable battery. Shame on Motorola."
3,its just OK,"Works fine outside the house, but will NOT work INSIDE my house. Keeps saying the signal is weak, the phone is 6"" from the headset! Once outside the house, it works fine. I agree that it is a little bulky and never seems to fit just right. Haven't lost or dropped it yet, however! So I'd give it a 3 on a scale of 1 - 5. Mostly because it won't work in the house! The phone, however, motorola razr, works PERFECT in the house!"
4,HS850 review,"I originally bought one with my Razor phone (3 phones now). The first one was defective, second one works fine. A little difficult for those of us technically challenged to set up but my wife has taken it over and loves it. Looking at getting the car set up next. Hands free is the way to go. A little more consumer friendly and this would be a fantastic tool. I will buy a second one and I am a real estate broker.David FloydCrye-Leike Commercial6158484918"
2,Did not stay,Well i love the looks and placement of the button on this headset but there was one major problem. It never stayed on my ear and it was hard puttin it on. Otherwise it did work well and clear. I returned in favor of the Jabra. This might fit your ear but just be forwarned it may not
1,I continue wating for this product.,"So far this product has not arrived to its destination, Costa Rica. I want to have it soon in my power. I please request, to carry out all the necessary one for solutions this inconvenience.Thank you!"
2,Motorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset Review,"We received two (2) of these bluetooth headsets from Amazon. They arrived promptly as usual from Amazon. Both units were substandard in terms of audio quality. The person on the other end on a call complained of bad quality and when we called our home phone, they sounded like a 'tin can.' We returned both sets to Amazon for a full refund and purchased another headset from Amazon which works much better. I would not recommend the Motorola HS850."
4,solid bluetooth headset,"I bought this for some members of my family. All of them love theie headsets. When I speak with them while they are using it, there is little to no background noise. the headset isn't to bulky as others are and youget about 6 hours of talk time. It has been connected to Motorola, Nokia, and Samsung cell phones.I had a faulty one, which was quickly resolved by Amazon. Other than that, the products work perfectly."
4,Would purchase again!!,This is a good hands free set. It doesn't stick into your ear but is secured by the ear clip. If you don't want an ear piece inside your ear this is the one for you!
5,This thing rocks!,"I love that it automatically syncs up with my phone, it is very user friendly and easy to operate. The audible tones serve as many different warnings and are extremely helpful. I would definately recommend this to anyone looking for a good bluetooth."
3,incompatible w/ Treo 650,"If this had worked with my Treo 650, I might have given it top marks since I like the look and functional design a lot. Unfortunately, all the complaints about it taking forever to be able to answer a call are true. I even upgraded my Treo OS but to no improvement - the phone went into voicemail half the time before the 850 would respond. This so-called Bluetooth ""standard"" isn't standard at all. I should receive the treo headset soon that's free w/ the phone purchase. I hope it will work well to make up for the not-so-great looks."
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MOTOROLA RAZR 3,"I have been using bluetooth headsets for almost two years. I have been using the Jabra 250. My Jabra 250's battery started to fail so I purchased the HS850 as I now had the RAZR 3 phone, figuring purchasing a bluetooth headset from the phone's manufacturer would be a good thing.Well, the HS850 sound quality is awful. Everyone I spoke to using this phone indicated that they could barely hear me and that my voice sounded muffled. I tried about ten calls from three different geographic locations in Los Angeles, all places with great cell coverage, before I gave up. The HS850 just has unsatisfactory voice quality and insufficient volume for use in a car, the reason I need the headset.I purchased the latest Jabra BT 250v and it works great! In fact, it works better than my original Jabra 250. By the way, I get about ten months of life out of my Jabra before the battery no longer charges."
3,ok headset,"great talk time. but echoes, volume is too low while driving, and wind reaks havoc on the 'listerner'. also horrible static if the phone is on the opposite side of your body from the headset."
1,Waste of money,The item was waste of money because it did not worked. I bought 2 items and thy only send me one. It was a waste of money
4,Shipped quickly!,Arrived in perfect condition and quickly! My only reason for putting 4 stars is that it doesn't stay on my ear as well as I had hoped.
3,Just not what I was hoping for....,Good:1. Turns off when you flip the mic closed.2. When Charging the blue light is lit until charged.Undecided: I have had moments when people say I sould like I am in a box and other times they say it sound like I am right next door. Not sure if it is the service or the device. 80% of the time if I transfer the call back to the phone it sounds better to the other person.Bad:1. Low Volume2. Moves around on your ear3. button to answer the phone does not seem to move...works but doesnt feel right
4,Good product,"I don't have lots of experience with tons of different bluetooth headsets, but I am very happy with it so far. It is a very comfortable earpiece. The sound quality is good and the battery life is great."
3,Dissapointed,"the sound quality sucks, i hear crackling constantly.the charger that it came with barely works.... i have to lean it a certain way to make contact... and even then it doesn't stay connected.a big minus is that the ear piece doesn't rotate 180 degree"
5,Blue tooth,"Great product. You can find the exact same thing in all the phone stores, the only difference is they charge about twice as much. Easy to hook up to any blue tooth ready phone, battery life seems to last for about 5-6 hours on continued phone calls, or about a day on standby. Definetly recommend this item."
2,Garbage - Spend the money and get something better.,The HS850 was good in the old days when bluetooth first came out but now it is just a wast of money to buy this thing. The problem is unless your in a quiet room you cant hear the other person on the phone. Forget trying to use this while driving. The background road noise will never let you have a decent conversation without you continually asking the person on the other end to speak up. Spend the money and get a decent headset or even a corded one. You wont regret it.Logitech Cordless Headset for PC & Mobile Phones
4,I CONSIDER WAS A GOOD PURCHASE,"YES, THIS PURCHASE WAS GOOD ITS, VERY LIGHT AND THE SOUND IS GOOD, CHARGING IS SO FAST"
2,Headset for Elephants,"I had a cute little H700 and it served its purpose until I lost it.I had to buy another one as the two states I spend 99% of my time now require drivers to be handsfree when taking on the cell. I looked through the reviews and bought this version thinking that it is a newer more robust model. To my dismay the hs850 is freakishly large, cheap plastic looking and will not stay on my ear. The wide ear hook in addition to the size/weight of the earpiece only make the matters worse. And forget about wearing sunglasess and the earpiece at the same time. There is just no room behind the ear for both.If I pressed the earpiece against my ear, the sound quality is not to bad. But that would defeat the whole purpose of ""hands-free""If you are a woman with normal sized ears -- try something else."
2,Not that great,"I had this bluetooth for a week, then I started having issues. It would disconnect from my phone on its own and then stopped connecting all together. In addition, it isn't that comfortable to wear for a long period of time."
3,HS850 Review,"This is, I guess, a relatively old headset. It was difficult to get the headset to pair with my Blackberry Curve and the loop for the ear is tiny. That said the sound is good and the fact that opening and closing the boom turns it off is really convenient."
2,"Excellent Headset, but Poorly Packaged for Shipping","I researched this bluetooth headset and found that it worked extraordinarily well with my Motorola V557 cell phone and it had good volume, call clarity and was comfortable to wear. Unfortunately, it was sent by Amazon in a small ziplock bag that was inside a larger ziplock bag containing the charger. The bluetooth headset, which was completely unprotected, must have continually ""banged"" against the charger during shipping. By the time I got it, the headset was scratched and looked used...like something I had found on the sidewalk. Also, when I shook the headset, something inside rattled. I returned the headset to Amazon for a refund and then bought the same model from a local discount store for 20% more.This was the first time that I have had to return anything to Amazon...too bad that Amazon did not ""bubble wrap"" the headset itself to protect it during shipping."
2,Volume low,"Everything seemed to work on this headset except the volume is too low to hear well. I have a newer model which works well, bought this one to use in my car because of the low price. Just not loud enough though, wish I had spent a little more money and gotten a better one. Besides that seems to work fine."
1,Poor sound quality,"I bought one of these and was very disappointed with the sound quality. I also did not like that it used the ""old style"" charging connector, and not the new mini usb interface that all of motorolas phones use. ( meaning when you're on the road, you need a phone charger and a headset charger).The sound volume was too low for me to hear on my end, and sounded like I was in a wind-tunnel to those I was talking to. I returned this device as I didn't think it was worth even the $30 or so amazon charges for it. I was very satisfied with amazon, but not with this particular product."
3,so-so,"good basic bluetooth, do not believe the 25 foot rule it can be 2 ft away from you and it starts to static. volume should be better. but all around it is actually durable so in this case it is you get what you pay for. but being this cheap does one actually think that it's gonna be the best?"
2,"Wouldn't be my first choice, bearly usable, Slightly better than my HS820","I bought this headset to replace my HS820. I previously used both the Motorola HS850 and the HS820 and had the same two problems with each.- Insecure attachment to my ear.- Insuffcient volumeWhenever I moved, the motorola headsets wiggled and made me feel as if they were about to fall off. They never did but it was still annoying.The volume problem was in part related to this. The contact with my ear wasn't very firm and the ambient noise that the headsets let in coupled with a relatively low volume meant that I had to press the headset to my ear to hear clearly.I gave it 2 stars rather than one because of the GREAT battery life.I finally bought a Plantronics 510 and have been very satisfied."
4,I like it,"The Motorola HS850 Bluetooth headset works very well. Reception from my phone is excellent, as well as its voice/sound clarity. People on the other end of my phone call say they hear me loud & clear.My only complaint is that the earhook piece irritates my ear after wearing it for at least half hour. If only Motorola could address the 'comfortability' of this headset, they'd have a complete winner!"
4,"works good, very little static","My headset is paired with a Motorola V551, and it works wonderfully. I am new to bluetooth, but this works better than the many and expensive wired connections I have had previously. Charge lasts a good while (3 days with short conversations, intermittent stretches of having it on for a while and no warning for low battery).Check the rebates for the V551 via Amazon with Cingular (making very certain that you will get good reception in your area first!!!) because after costs were tallied I ended up getting the phone and headset for free..."
3,OK headset.,"Bought this to replace the HS820 simply for the flip-on functionality. After about 2 months of use, I have concluded that with the exception of the flip-on trick, the HS820 is actually a better headset. Mainly due to the volume. The HS820 has MUCH more volume and even seemed to fit on the ear a little better. Not a bad unit at all, but the volume and fitment issues should have been resolved before product release."
1,Ho one can hear me,There is no volume set on it for your voice no one can here me - I wish I did not throw away the package
4,not bad...,"Nice form factor, I like that flipping the boom open turns it on. Earpiece could be a bit tighter, but it fits pretty well otherwise. Sound quality is not as good as I had hoped, but still very usable. Beats the hell out holding the phone up to my ear for hours on end."
1,Substandard...,I was very disapppointed with this purchase. I knew the price was too good to be true. Its' performance is substandard. It's an old model. I hadn't realized until I received it. It's is large and cumbersome. The sound is very dismal. Would strongly NOT recommend it.
4,Nice in all ways,"This headset is not only stylish but great sound quality. Some times, in noisy situation, I have to push it closer to my ear to hear, but overall I am very satisfied. I use it with my Sprint LG Fusic. Paired really easily."
2,Motorola HS 850 Headset,The unit came in a baggie with the wrong AC adapter. Amazon credited me $2- obviously not enough to cover the cost of a new adapted but th unit works fineIt is better than other units that I have had. I especially like the folding mouthpiece that puts the unit in standby mode. It improves the battery life and doesn't activate till you open the unit- believe me this makes a difference
3,HS850 Bluetooth Headset,The volume level is too low and it doesn't seem to fit around my ear very well.
5,Excellent product,"This is my third bluetooth and its the best. Excellent sound quality, ease of use and great that it turns off when the folding boom. Also like that it fits on top of the ear instead of in the ear."
3,Bluetooth Head set,"I love my Motorola HS850 Headset, however I question if it was new or used, because it has a very short battery life. It often doesn't last all day. I constantly have to charge it, which is a pain because I travel a lot. The product works well except for the battery issue."
1,Don't buy this - no battery life!,This is a waste of money - I get about 30 minutes talk time and less than one day standby on a charge. Might as well burn your money.
1,background noise,I have bought the same product before - and haven't had such a bad piece. May be this is was an anomaly - but it just wasn't of any use - because there was so much noise - and the sound was so shrill that you cannot understand what the person on the other side was saying.
1,The Bluetooth would not work on my phone,"I charged the Bluetooth as instructed; but every time I tried to program it to my phone it would not work. I tried to redo the instructions still it would not work. The Bluetooth is still not programed to my phone now. If I had not thrown the packing away by mistake, I would have sent it back to the manufacturer."
3,died after 3 years,"it was an ok product, but it stop charging, then stopped working after 3.5 years.I guess i got my money worth."
4,"Good, but NOT the Best!","This wireless headset is a wonderful solution for hands free cell phone communication. It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time. However, it has its dissadvantages. As others have pointed out, this headset produces rather low volumes, unless the volume is cranked all of the way up. It helps if you turn the volume gain up on the cell phone itself, but that causes some echo for the other person that is talking to you. My wife and I each have one of these headsets, and they are both identical with the low volume output issue. They also both emit a light ""hissing"" sound in the earpiece when talking. Overall these shortcomings are outweighed by the positives of this device. It is a very useful and feature rich headset, but be warned that the mild hissing and low volume output will certainly be an annoyance at times. I would still recommend this headset because the cons are far less than the pros."
3,Poor Horiz Ant Polarization,When the phone is on my belt the connection is noisy and crackles. When the phone is horrizontal to the headset everything is fine. If I want to hold my phone up off my belt I may as well use the handset. The volume is fair at best. My clients complain about sound quality ontheir end.I have now tried a plantronics headset with far better results. This one will go to e-Bay.
2,HS850 --> OK headset,"Fair headset. Great to have a wireless bluetooth headset but my complaints are follows:1. Poor volume - at highest volume setting, can barely hear.2. Doesn't fit my ear well3. All options not available/compatible w/ my Treo 650."
1,Junk,"Let me start off by saying I am not a negative person. I have thoroughly enjoyed using Amazon up until this point. I saw this headset and liked the price, saw that it was a Motorola, so I ordered it, thinking I got a great deal. Well, when it came, it looked used and after I plugged it in, it didn't do a thing. I had it plugged in to charge for a half hour - nothing. So, giving Amazon the benefit of the doubt, I asked for a replacement and sent the first one back. The second unit came and it looked worse and also didn't do anything when it was plugged in. So, I'm not sure if they're aware they're selling used junk or what but they really need to pull these off their ""shelf"". They're garbage. They're even too light to make decent paperweights! Needless to say, I sent the second one back and asked for a refund. I guess the hunt continues..."
1,Bulk Package ????,"Amazon is nice in customer service...There are scratches on the product...I have approached customer service..They have replaced my order..Unfortunately, it got scratches again..Is it because of bulk packaged item ???. The quality of the product is poor. The voice is also not clear from bluetooth device.."
5,It just works great,"I'm not a Bluetooth techie, so I can't compare this to other headsets, but after a month of ownership, I can say it works great.My car has built-in Bluetooth, but everbody tells me that when I'm in the car it sounds like I'm under water. Not so with the Motorola - I'm told it's crystal-clear.The only negatives I have are:* The multifunction button has no tactile feel - it leads you to press too hard, and too often. This is especially a problem when you're walking or driving.* The flip out mic is nifty, but the headset tends to wobble if you shake your head at all."
5,Amazing Bluetooth Headset,"I recently purchased 2 Bluetooth Headsets from Amazon. I was very skeptical about them before I purchased them. Now, I don't leave the house without mine. The reception and the transmittion are both crystal clear. It allows me to drive with both hands on the wheel. It is very very easy to use and fits comfortably on either ear. Wonderful."
2,not thrilled,"I like the HS850 better when used with my Treo 650 than I do with my RAZR from Motorola. It's the best of the 4 bluetooth earpieces I've tried... but still not good enough. It's not loud enough, it doesn't always answer the call when the built in button is pushed and you have to hold it against your ear if you really want to hear. For me, there it's good enough to be able to depend on."
5,"Works well with SAMSUNG D500, SONY ERICSSON T616,Powerbook","I used this for almost a week with two cellphones and one computer.SAMSUNG D500 - very easy to connect. sound quality is great.SONY ERICSSON - works well also.Powerbook 15"" Alum. I setup the headset as an output device in ""SOUND preference"" and listen to internet radio via Real Player. I can go as far as 10 feet away from the base device and still get excellent reception.The quality is excellent. This is the first time I use a Bluetooth headset and I found it very comfortable to wear and non intrusive.Price wise, it's cheapest on amazon. I checked everywhere and with shipping and tax, there isn't any where that sell this device for less then $80.Conclusion: It is pricey to pay $80 for a headset but ... it's worth it."
1,Dirty headset,"I was disappointed when I received my headset; it was a used item and dirty. I notified AccessoryOne and they said it was warehouse dust (of course, without having having a chance to inspect the unit). I took a closer inspection, and it was certainly not dry dust, but skin/dirt/sweat/earwax material, similar to the residue that builds up on computer mice or keyboards over time - sticky, not dry. I did not test the unit and returned it for a refund."
4,Older model is better,"The features and usability of this product are outstanding. Talk times, idle times, charging times are all very reasonable.The volume of the earpiece is a little below par. The idea of having a bluetooth earpiece to use while driving is a great idea, but not when you have this item. The max volume is not quite enough to hear your party on the other end. This could be due to how the earpiece fits on the ear though. It seems loose, and doesn't quite seat itself firmly at the outer part of the ear canal.Overall, a great item. I only wish it had more volume."
5,what I paid for,the product is exactly what I expected it to be for the amazing price that I paid for it.very good product.
2,HS 850,Item shipped and arrived fine. It just didn't work properly. Volume control did not work. I sent it back and bought a different Mororola product.
3,"Good headset, terrible charger","I really like it as a headset, but it carries the horrible charger port that motorola put on many of its products before the switch to micro-usb. This is prone to not working, and mine is very difficult to get to charge about 2 months into using it. It's a great headset when I can get it to fully charge, though. The lack of charging is a major drawback. (I knocked 2 stars off of an otherwise great headset because my experience with this type of motorola charging connection is that it always stops working after a few months. I just bought a later motorola headset which is very similar, but uses micro-usb, which I expect to give 5 stars to.)"
5,Love this bluetooth!,"Had a bluetooth same model previously; after a long period of use it seemed to be getting tired, as person on other end of call frequently had trouble hearing me. With this purchase, that problem is a thing of the past. Good product; just have to be reasonable in not expecting an electronic product whose energy cell cannot be replaced to last forever."
1,Wouldn't work,"Bought this to replace another Motorola ear piece that broke. This one wouldn't charge when I got it. The charger connection was some proprietary version I have not seen before (not the standard mini or micro USB) and would not charge unless I held it a certain way. I sent it back so never had a chance to use it so can't speak to it's functionality. Amazon was great about the return process, as usual."
3,It could be great,"It could be great.The good:-It easily turns on and off with the folding mic.-The audio is really good.The not so good:-Wind distortion is pretty bad.-It swings on my ear. This is due to the mic creating an unfair balance for the hook. If the thing would fit in the ear, it would not swing. If you torque it right, it won't swing too much. The rubber will on the bluetooth will stick then.I don't consider bonding an issue, but it could be. Hold the button in and immediately flip open the mic just in case."
1,Leftover,"Seems like for the good price, you get the leftover gear. They sent me a left-handed set...which can be switched around, but the buttons are reversed. Also, the battery life is terrible and it just cuts out in the middle of conversations even though the battery still has charge in it...usually just after charging. I think for this price, we're getting the factory rejects."
3,Say what?,"I'll be the first to admit my hearing is not what it used to be. However, I am by no means deaf or at least I though I wasn't until I purchased the hs850. My one major complaint with this headset is its lack of sufficient volume to be heard in anything but a quiet environment. Its fit, ease of use, and clarity are very good but I can only give this headset an average rating due to its one major flaw, the lack of volume."
2,A flawed design,"I love not having the wire, but the microphone is so close to the earpiece that everyone I talk to with the headset is annoyed and complains about hearing themselves (in echo). This problem can be diminished somewhat by turning the volume down, but then I can't hear the person I'm talking to either (unless I'm in a perfectly silent place). Other than this design flaw, the headset is a nifty gadget with elegant controls, good battery life, etc."
2,Loose fit and not loud enough to use in a car,"I recently purchased the HS850 since it came highly recommended but it turned out to be a disappointment. Just as others have mentioned, the headset doesn't fit well for all people. I felt I had to barely hang it on my ear to get the speaker low enough to be able to hear the caller. Even then, you can't get the volume loud enough to comfortably listen to the caller while driving. If you are using this headset in a car, you'll find that the volume is never loud enough and the fit is so loose that your afraid your going to fling the headset off if you turn around to change lanes. Of course, you can do what most driver's do that are talking on cellphones...merge anyway and let everyone else get out of the way."
4,Great headset...Just not with my Treo 650,"I love this headset, I tried it with my freinds Motorola phone and it was comfortable, light, and folds down to be really small. The only thing is that with my Treo 650 it takes too long to connect(2-5 seconds). So I will have to find another one."
2,"Low Volume, Uncomfortable Fit","After reading great reviews on this headset, I went ahead and made the purchase. Unfortunately, my experience has not at all been positive with this headset.First, I can barely hear well enough to have a conversation in the car, airport, or other busy place. This surprises me, given that I have paired the headset with a Motorola Razr.Second, the fit is very uncomfortable and causes me discomfort after roughly half an hour of wear. For someone who requires a good amount of time talking on my phone, this just doesn't work.Can't recommend this headset... I suggest finding another one!"
2,not for large ears,"The sound and reception on this seemed fine, but I have rather large ears --handy in case I need to fly out of dangerous situations -- and I could not adjust it so the business end fit inside the opening of my ear."
3,Very functional but low ear piece volume,"The HS850 is a very good headset with lots of features but...1. The volume in the headset is very low. Now this may be me, the phone or something else but personally it is too low.2. Like all BT headsets I have used, it lacks a mute button on the device.Otherwise, the flip open is great and the sound quality of the MIC is very good. If you have good hearing, get this one, otherwise choose another."
4,Headset works well,"I like the headset, volume could go louder, hard to hear on the highway, dont like the multifunction button, does not move or click when I press it, so I can never tell if I am pressing it hard enough or not. It seems to work well so far, good standby and usage time on a charge. I wish you could turn it off while the boom is open."
4,Motorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset,O.K. when pairing with Samsung Bluetooth D807 (?) cell phone but couldn't with a Nokia.
3,Convenient but not optimized,"I like the fact that you can just close and open the boom to turn the headset on and off. The headset can stay on standby for over a week without recharging. The headset itself is clumsy though. The clip doesn't fit very well over your ear and it fell off my ear quite a couple of times when I'm checking my blindspots while driving. The speaker on the headset is also very low compared to the Plantronics Voyager 510 that I bought for my wife at the same time. I guess it wouldn't be a problem if the headset fits you. The noise reduction is also very good on the headset. So, I would suggest going to the store and try this on before buying it. If the clip works on your ear, it's a great product for you. Otherwise, you'll be struggling from time to time keeping this headset on your head and trying to listen to your caller."
4,Nice head set,This nice little headset is a nice addition to my phone. It connects very quickly and was easy to set up. The only thing I haven't gotten it to do is voice dialing.
1,If there is a 0 star I would select it,"Please don't buy this headset. It is about the most useless product that Motorola has ever made. You can hardly hear the end speaker and the end speaker can not hear you as well. Continue to lose connection even with the phone within 3 feet away. When clicked to answer the call, most of the time it will not work. It is completely useless. I sure hope that the other manufacturers produce a better a headset. If they are all the same, I will live without one."
2,"Dont Buy, Tricky to work","Well i got a new bluetooth phone and i figured it would be nice to have a head set with it. so i got the Motorola HS850, the first time i connected it to my Sony Ericson S710a and it worked fine.....for one call. then after that it wouldnt connect to my phone. i just kept getting the connection fail message. after then i tried to pair it with another phone and the headset wouldnt go back into pairing mode. so it couldnt connect to anything else. so for 70 dollars this headset was not worth the money and the headache"
2,betrays its purpose: mobility,"Although the sound quality was excellent, the volume is really low and combined with the over-the-ear design it results in its usefulness while driving or doing outdoor activities, when the handsfree function is required, therefore although a nice piece of equipment, it just doesn't delieverwhat it's supposed to. I purchased mine from Amazon, which i considered a serious seller, but after i took it to a repair shop after dropping it in coffee, the guy laughed at me and showed me its VERY cheap (<$2)ERICSSON speaker! so, since when does Motorola use ericsson components in their headsets?"
3,Does not work with pc,I purchased this headset to use with my pc. Unfortunaly it isn't compatible with a computer. Just with a phone. So back it goes.
1,Motorola HS850 bluetooth headset,"I purchased this item for my husband to replace the one that accidentally went through the washing machine. While he was happy with the performance of his original HS850, the replacement had a buzz in the speaker, so we had to return it. I must say that the seller was very easy to deal with."
5,"Great Product, Great Price",Got this product being new to bluetooth technology. It is very easy to use and the best value I could find for such a new thing. The quality of the unit is up to par with all my expectations.
5,awesome device,This product is fantastic. It's easy to setup and the quality is great. I've been as far away as 40ft from the device and it continues working. I've suggested this to all my friends. Also amazon had the best price for this. It was 40 dollars cheaper than the stores in the mall.
3,Nice form factor but not so nice performance,"I bought this unit to go with my new Samsung i730. I like the functionality of the device, being able to turn it on and off with the boom and being able to answer calls by just pressing the button on my ear but the sound quality and volume on both my end and the other persons end leaves allot to be desired. Can't really use it in the car, can't hear. I am leary about Bluetooth headsets now. Will probably go back to wearing a wired one, at least in the car."
1,"Used, Came set up for the left ear!supposed to be shipped for the right ear!","Bulk packaged? What the heck is that! In a plastic baggie thats what. next time I will read more closer. I thought mine was gonna be in a retail package new.NOT! Motorola clearly states it comes shipped for the right ear, someone, or some other customer switched mine to be set up for the left!No more bulk item package for me,BEWARE. Its supposed to come from the right ear from the factory, if it came for the left ear ,you got a used one."
2,Cheap Piece of Plastic!,"I bought this through Verizon (my mistake) when it was $100 with warranty and after about 4 months of NORMAL use, the plastic fold-out microphone cracked! I'm still not sure how it happened, but it would not hit the little button to connect anymore, so now it's trash. I really think that these companies make these types of products so cheaply so that you have to keep re-buying them. And, of course the warranty didn't cover a crack. Very disappointed!"
1,Bluetooth with a mind of it's own,"Ordered this upon the recommendation of my boss, who had an earlier motorola version, and liked the features. Linked to my Nokia cellphone just fine, and I called my wife to tell her and find out how it sounded. Great, sound was not bad, noice level was a little high, but manageable. She had to go, so I pressed the disconnect button to hang up, and then the bluetooth just freaked out...anytime I opened the mouthpiece it began auto-dialing my wife's cellphone. Tried to dial a different number with the same results..any noise in the vicinity of the mouthpiece was interpreted as a voice command, error message said no voice tags loaded, and the bluetooth would attempt to redail the last number called...tried to troubleshoot, tried downloading the manual...no help. Am returning it today and getting a more reliable plantronics headset...don't waste your money on this model!!"
2,Not entirely satisfied customer,"I suppose you get what you pay for. The instructions are rather too minimalist for my liking, but the most irritating feature is the unresponsiveness of the button you have to press when you take a call. It doesn't always work, so you can hear the phone ringing in your ear but can't pick up the call, even after pressing the button repeatedly.I'd advise purchasing a more expensive and reliable model. The idea is presumably to minimize distraction while driving, not increase frustration."
1,Motorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset,"I received a Motorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset a couple day before, but itdid not work at all when i used it first time. Then I request it,but Amazon still did not respond to me."
2,Works but is very obviously used,"I thought that this was a new item, just packaged in bulk, however, this is very clearly used as evidenced by scratches on the boom, the power button and makeup in the rubber spot on the mic. I don't appreciate having to disenfect my items before using them and I don't mind buying used, so long as I know it is used when purchasing. So just be forewarned that you are buying a USED product."
3,Buy on Amazon,"I bought this headset when I upgraded to a bluetooth enabled cell phone. Overall the device is ok. Easy setup and convenient. The boom helps with the saving of battery life, i.e. close it, no wasted battery. On the downside, the battery life in general usually doesn't last me a full day. I do use my cell phone alot, so that may be the issue. Also it can be hard to hear on the device. I'm always trying to turn up the volume only to realize it is maxed. It says you can mute the ear piece by pressing both volume buttons at the same time, well I haven't been able to get this function to work once. Overall, for the money here on Amazon (around $30) it's worth it. But I paid full price at Verizon and it was almost $80, but I suppose that's my mistake for trying to be on the cutting edge of gadgetery."
3,Insufficient volume,"I was impressed with the reviews on the Motorola HS850 and looked for favorable references to the volume available on the unit. My hearing is not as good as it was 20 years ago and knowing that I would be using my Bluetooth as I drive meant I would have to have a unit that I could hear easily. That was not my experience with the Motorola HS850. I used it just two times and gave up on ever being able to hear adequately. It probably works as well as any over-the-ear unit, but it was not sufficient for me. I replaced it with a Bluetooth that uses an earbud earpiece and I get along fine with that unit. If hearing is a concern for the buyer, I would not recommend the Motorola HS850. In every other way the unit performed as advertised. It was simple to pair to my phone and it picked up calls and transmitted my voice just as I expected it to. If I could have heard the unit, it would have been fine."
3,Loose fit falls off often,"This headset would be great if the fit wasn't so loose. There is no way to adjust it to make it fit snugly, so f you lean forwards, backwards, sideways, it always feels like its about to fall off. The sound quality WOULD be great if the fit could be adjusted to stay close to the ear, but because it is always flopping around and there is so much air between the speaker and the ear, it is incredibly difficult to hear sometines, especially in noisy or windy areas; I often find myself holding it closer to my ear while I talk, and if I have to do that what is the point of even having one? The original reviews and the great price convinced me this would be wonderful, but the cheap one I had originally bought for $30 from my wireless provider was actually much better."
2,Fragile and Low Volume,This was my first experience with a bluetooth device so I didn't have a lot to compare to. I found the volume on this headset to be somewhat low most of the time. I mostly used the headset outdoors and any wind or other noise causes a lot of problems. After having the headset for about two months it caught on my seat belt as I was getting out of my car and broke at the point where the mic boom swings out. I've since tried several other headsets and this is the last one I would recommend.
5,good gift,"These were purchased as a gift, so don't know details of quality, etc. They did arrive in time for Christmas, which was important."
3,bluetooth headset,I was delighted with this headset. It was very comfortable and worked well. Problem was I lost after only a few weeks. Wearing in a JC penney if fell off my ear. Fits too loosely.
1,Will not pair - cannot use,"The headset paired with my phone quickly and worked for one day only. Volume was only fair but I liked the way it worked. Day two, mid-call, it lost its blue-tooth connection with my phone. Since then, I have been unable to get the headset to emit the steady signal to allow it to be paired again. The headset blinks but will not send the steady, pairing signal.This was a brand new item and came with a useless little instruction manual with no troubleshooting. I thought I might try taking out the battery but can't figure out how to open the unit without damaging it.I am not happy!"
4,2 months and would highly recommend it,"I purchased the 850 reluctently after reading some mixed reviews. This is what I have found so far.Sound Quality is good if not excellentVolume could be a bit louder but I have high pitch hearing lossbut it is acceptable even while driving in my truck.No wind noise what so everDistance good to about 25 feet but works best @ 20 or belowFlip boom is especially usefull, no worries about acidently activating it by pushing a buttonBattery life is about what is listed"
2,It broke already,"I was very excited when I received this. The look was exactly what I wanted (the blue light and all), it seemed to hold onto my ear, and the unfolding to activate it made perfect sense to me. One day it fell of onto the concrete when I bent over to pick something up. After impact, it has never worked correctly. When it is closed, it still acts as if it were open, allowing it to drain all day - which makes it useless in the evening. It also won't stay connected very long. Of course, it would seem like I should be a bit more careful, but it shouldn't have fallen off my ear in the first place! The sound quality was good when it worked, however, I found myself always holding it closer to my ear when there was background noise, even with the volume turned all the way up. Shouldn't it be 'hands-free'?! I will be looking for something else."
3,good,"I have it coupled with my Mototrola Razr telephone. Sometimes turning it on resluts in it calling the first number with or without any instructions, and then it does not hang up easiliy by pressing the button which results in having to find the phone and openening it and then pressing the hangup button on the telphone iteself. This a dangerous procedure when driving and when one one must hang up the unwanted call."
1,Don't buy this bluetooth headset,I bought this bluetooth device because it was rated highly by Consumer Reports but found the reception to be terrible. Whoever I was talking to could hear themselves echo and it was so distracting they asked me to turn it off. I sent the first one back thinking it was faulty but it happened again with the second one. I think bluetooth has a way to go before it works well.
2,It's OK if you have good hearing,"It's functional, inexpensive, and easy to use, but the volume control is inadequate...at least for me who has less than average hearing. The earpiece doesn't penetrate the ear far enough to be heard with average road noise, so I have to press on it and hold it in, which defeats the hands-free purpose."
2,Defective out of the box,Didn't event get a chance to use this b/c the power unit made crackling sounds when I plugged it in. Tried it on a couple of receptacles and got the same thing. Wondering about Moto QA on these units. Also the casing feels cheap.
3,just OK,"With the caveat that this is my first bluetooth product, I found the headset to be 'just OK'. Nice and light, relatively comfortable, but hard to hear even with the volume up and definitely some extraneous sound pick up by the microphone."
4,Fantastic,Definately worth the money. This piece is so light you can almost forget you are wearing it. Only complaint is that wearing with glasses/sunglasses does create a bit of maneuvering. Connects quickly and easily. Features are great.
5,Motorola HS850 bluetooth is terrific,"I love this headset. It does everything it is supposed to do. I was easily able to customize which ear I can wear it on and change the orientation of the volume buttons. I can hear everyone clearly and they hear me clearly. The battery lasts a long long time, days for me. It will automatically answer my phone and I can hang up from the headeset, not like another I had before this one. I can leave my phone on the counter and walk all over my huge kitchen talking clearly. I am very impressed, I recommended this to another and he bought it and is just as happy. Best of all, my motorola charger from my phone will charge this headset in the car or house. Nothing extra to buy."
2,I can't hear you!!!,"Like many who have reviewed this headset, I was initially very pleased with the ease of setup and the apparent ease of use. None of that mattered, though, the first time I tried to use it in my car. The hand I would normally have used to hold a phone to my ear is now occupied trying to press this Motorola headset against my ear tightly enough to have any chance of hearing the call. I would absolutely not recommend this headset for that reason."
2,Compact but hardly usable,"Goods:Small, lang-lasting battery, very easy to put on, comfortable to wear, easy to install... in other words it could've been a great device if not all these...Bads:I could hear people at the other and of the line well only provided it was quite around. Standing on a busy and therefore noisy street made me upset because I could only guess what my friend just said. So, if you plan to use it in the car and it's sound proof then it's a great thing, otherwise... disappointing"
4,pretty good - not the most comfortable,"I swapped out a Jabra BT250V for this (see review). The Moto is a heck of a lot better - sound quality pretty good on the calls, functions with the Moto E815 no problem - voice dialing works without a hitch, volume on the phone controls headset volume, redial function, etc. The moto is kind of clunky feeling - you know you're wearing it but not that uncomfortable. Just a big plastic thing hanging off the top of your ear rather than the ""in the ear"" school of thought. I love my Jabra wired headset - don't know why the BT was so horrible. Works fine in the car as long as the windows are rolled up - affected by wind noise, high background volume, etc. But that's to be expected. Can't comment on battery life - haven't had to charge it again yet. Folding boom switch is great. I turn auto answer off and just fold out the boom to turn on the headset as needed. Overall - the range and sound quality are very acceptable."
2,"A Really Great Headset, but so badly built","It worked really well, easy to pair with multiple devices, went on quickly, reconnected itself to my blackberry quickly when a call came in. However, I had to return it three times for a replacement, as the folding boom snapped off twice, and one time it just stopped charging. Finally, I gave up trying and bought the more basic ""boomless"" motorola, but the volume on that is impossibly low. I'm looking for a better alternative right now, I may go back to Jabra, since Moto just don't seem to be able to get it right."
3,Battery doesn't last as long as advertised,"Overall, it is a great wireless headset that works well with my Treo 650. However, the standby mode with the microphone boom folded in the OFF position, only lasted about 20 hours as apposed to the 200 hours that was advertised."
2,Great headset...if you have a Motorola phone...,"If you have a Motorola phone this baby gives you great service and reliability.However, it WILL NOT sync up to a Nokia or LG phone. I've had both a Nokia (forget the model number) and now an LG-CU500, and neither will recognize it. It is incredibly frustrating.I have nothing against the product itself...my OLD Motorola phone still recognizes it immediately, but the fact that it is incompatible with other phones is ridiculous."
2,bad ear desing,plastic piece that goes over the ear is one shape that can not be changed. Problem is it does not hold well to my ear and moves around on my ear quite a bit. great price if you are just going to sit at a desk and not move much.
2,I'm so disappointed,"I am disappointed in this product. Everyone I call complains about the sound quality. They say it sounds like i'm in a tunnel or it's an echo. Also the other thing is there is no battery running low warning, it just dies. It also feels flimsy on the ear, like it's going to fall off. Someone asked me if all these issues are ""user error"", it's not, i've read the instructions front to back and use it as directed."
4,Great Value,"This is the first Bluetooth headset I've ever purchased. It works great, sound quality could be better but it may be normal for bluetooth headsets. For the money ($25) you can't go wrong with this set."
3,A Good Value,"Works well with Motorola phones, easy to set up and use. I like the boom feature, which allows you close it and save battery power. Good sound quality, all in all a pretty decent product at a good price. Fancier bluetooths are available, but this one gets the job done and doesn't leave you broke."
3,loose around the ear,"This bluetooth headset worked well, good sound quality, but sat loosely around my ear. You might want to try one on at a store before ordering."
3,HS 850 Bluetooth.,"This earpiece is very comfortable to wesr. Although it lacks the benefits of the higher priced models, it works well in quiet enviroments."
2,HS700 is better,"This headset works fine re quality of sound, but is quite large. Boom as an on / off switch also works well. The reason I give it two stars is that is uses a unique power cable not a mini USB connection. I have enough cables to manage already."
4,A great buy at the price,"What a bargain.This is my second bluetooth headset. I waited for a year to write a review because my last one quit working after 3 months due to poor design. This one is still going strong. It's easy to use, it recharges easily and quickly and the sound quality is great."
3,not very clear,"I bought this product a few months ago. It has good range but it is sometimes hard to hear the people on the phone. Also, my friends complained of not being able to hear me."
2,OK Ear Piece,This ear piece is just ok. It is very big and will not stay flush to the ear. Most of the time I have to press it to my ear to hear what the other person is saying.
1,Motorola HS850,"I had used the HS700 for ~2 years with good results - clear reception and transmission, comfortable fit.I expected the same or even better performance when I upgraded to the HS850.I was mistaken.The HS850 had crackling reception, was uncomfortable to wear and had this annoying tone that would play when a connection was made and drown out the first words of the conversation.I returned the 850 and bought the HS710.I am satiisfied w/ the 710."
3,Another Motorola problem,"Motorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset - BlackAnother Motorola quality control problem. The unit arrived with an inoperative 110 volt power supply. The unit will not give you the additional tone to indicate you have to repeat voice dial name. The headset volume is sometimes too low with the volume turned all the way up. Then mysteriously it will abruptly be too loud. Other than that it works reliably and I really like the folding mike to turn off the unit. The previous unit that I had, the mike failed to pick up my voice unless I screamed at the top of my voice. This is my third Motorola and 5th bluetooth headset but the only reason is that keep buying Motorola is that I really like the compact design, plus it stays on your ear better that others but because of the frequent poor quality I refuse to pay the retail price. Their customer service really stinks, they don't really speak English and there is a serious comprehension problem too."
4,Motorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset,"I have never owned anything with Bluetooth, so I have nothing to compare to. I think this is a great product. The only negative would be low volume."
1,Don't waste your money!,"bought this on a recommendation from a colleague. First of all the charger is not a USB connection so it is a separate charger than my phone (BlackBerry 8703). The headset does not attach to your ear very easily and seems to want to fall off. Sound quality outbound seemed fine but inbound was so low I had press the earpiece up to my ear (so much for hands free), and that did not completely solve the problem. Set up was easy as all BT headsets are pretty easy to pair. I returned and bought the Moto H500. Fit is perfect, sound is much better/louder and one-button functions are easy to operate.Save a little $$ and time and go with the H500."
3,great product with annoying flaws!,here's the quick and dirty:- plastic gasket (ear padding) starts tearing after a while- battery charger connector goes bad after a while making it a hassle to get a simple charge. i haven't figured out if its the headset or the connector yet but regardless its quite annoying- volume could be better but i was used to the jabra BT250 that has amazing sound quality- foldable design is excellent for conserving power and ending calls. this is probably one of the best features of this product and made me stick to it- battery capacity is AMAZING. it is seriously a long life product even after hours of constant use. i didn't even know they could get it this long and small (no bull in their ads on this one)- extended wear is uncomfortable. quite the opposite of the jabra BT250 that you could forget on your ear for a whole day without any discomfortim looking to buy another one of these but have been hoping to see these flaws rectified first.
3,Hands free,Well the price was okay and the item worked just fine I just did not realize how large it is . That why it is just okay... Still a great price.
2,DON'T LIKE IT,DON'T LIKE THAT I CAN'T US ON BOTH SIDE LOOKED LIKE IT WAS ONE COULD FLIP FROM EAR TO THE OTHER.WOULD NOT GET IT AGAIN
3,"well, at least it works...","First, shame on Amazon: the product is clearly used. That's not the same thing as bulk packaged, and it should be called out explicitly in the item description. Mine came set up for left ear use and with lots of little scratches on the clear plastic.Second, shame on Motorola: Their old units (like the H350) used a mini USB connector for charging. This was eminently practical. I don't know if Motorola felt that was just too good an idea or if their finances were really suffering from reduced accessory sales, but the HS850 has a Motorola-only power connector. Granted, the charger isn't hard to obtain, but it's nowhere near as ubiquitous (at least in my life) as a mini USB-B.Three stars because it's not a total loss: I can tolerate the cosmetic issues for the price, and I can deal with the power connector because the unit generally does what it's supposed to do, albeit with occasional complaints about voice quality. This lands us squarely in mediocrity."
3,Decent,"This is a decent Bluetooth headset.static, in general,is tolerable, unlike many of Motorola's other (and pricier) headsets.However, the volume level is far too low. One has to literally press the headset against one's ear when driving on the freeway.On the bright side, the open/fold of the boom to turn the headset on/off is and innovative feature unique to Motorola headsets (and not all of them, at that)."
4,"Great sound, but Ouch!","This headset has excellent sound and ease of use, and the price was right. However, I returned it in fear that my ear would fall off. It is a bit heavy and the ear piece does not fit right, so I spent a lot of time trying to make it fit. Nevertheless, the item was painful to the ear and the manufacturer will need to address that problem. Amazon, by the way, offers a very good price for the legitimate product.I purchased the Plantronics Voyager 510 from Amazon to replace the Motorola HS850, and I'm very happy with it. Excellent sound, ease of use, and no irritation to the ear.In my opinion, the HS850 is perhaps a good option for Van Gogh copycats."
2,"Inadequate volume, uncomfortable","I was disappointed with this headset. My gripes are: (1) maximum listening volume is too low in noisy situations; (2) uncomfortable earpiece for eyeglass-wearers like me; (3) control buttons are cheesy quality (main ""multifunction"" button lost its 'click' a few months after purchase, and now must be pressed off-center to work); (4) poor battery life. On the upside, the microphone seems to pick up well, according to people I call. I'll look elsewhere for my next headset."
1,Don't waste your money,"The headset does not fit everyone well and the sound quality is poor. I had a difficult time getting the headset to sit comfortably on my ear. If I moved my head, the headset would fall off. When I did use the headset, I was told that my conversations echoed.I barely used the Bluetooth for a week before hanging it up."
4,Good unit for a good price,"This was my first BT headset, and it wasn't an easy choice! I am using it with a Razr, and it works extremely well. I love the ease of use, and how the unit doesn't require to use battery in a ""stand-by"" mode. It can be opened and closed, which turns it on and off, in an instant. I don't even have to turn the Bluetooth on and off on my phone, either. So for ease of use, I give it a 10!I do wish it was a tad bit louder. I found out by accident that my phone sets a volume level for the headset, and the headset has a separate volume control. With both maxed out, it can still be hard to hear soft-spoken people while I'm driving in my car. 95% of the time, it's perfect volume.The ear piece does hang loose on the ear, but it's secure... you'd have to ""head bang"" to throw it off. I can also wear this unit with my sunglasses on without any problems.No regrets."
3,Good for indoors,I have been using HS850 for the last 1 year. It is portable hovewer the mic reception is not good @ car or in noisy environments. Good for indoors poor for outdoors.
2,useless in my car,"Great ergonomics, works fine in the house, but I had consistent problems getting people to hear me when in my car. I drive a Honda CRV, and while it's not as whisper-quiet as a luxury sedan it's not all that noisy a vehicle. As far as I could tell, the noise cancelling capabilities advertised have no value whatsoever. So, great headset for the office, but not a good buy if you're looking for a headset to use in the car."
4,Nice Headset for use with Moto phones,I was disappointed initially with this headset but after I switched from a Samsung D357 to a Moto 557 it quit echoing.The biggest drawback is that sometimes the headset does not get loud enough for you to hear your caller. I don't know if that is a result of the signal strength for me (or lack thereof) or the caller but it can be frustrating at times.The only other drawback for some (not me but my wife) is that it doesn't fit her ear tight enough. I personally like that fact that it fits loosely.Overall I'm not unhappy with this purchase but I must confess this is the only headset I've ever tried so I may not know what I'm missing?Dude in Memphis
4,Good product. I love the convenience of the bluetooth,"This is the 3rd HS 850 Ive had. They have all worked great. I lost one and damaged one. I paid $90 dollars for the bluetooth with a case and car charger. I am happy with it, but I do have a problem with the volume sometimes. It seems to be tricky to get it loud enough."
2,Ok for home use - not loud enough for car,"This headset works ok. I do have people that can tell I'm not on the normal phone. THe biggest problem is that it doesn't have enough volume to really be used in my car (which is a pretty quiet car). I will be shopping for another headset. The ""bulk packaging"" really leaves you feeling like your missing something as well. Finally, compared to earlier bluetooth headsets that I've had, this one is VERY limited on features. No mute that I can figure out, limited range (about 7 feet), and using flash requires a long hold on the same button that will hang up the phone."
4,Motorola 850,"I have enjoyed this earpiece. It is very comfortable and I can hear very well. Compaired to other Bluetooth products that other family members have, I like the boom on this one because it is an easy on and off. This works well with my Motorola Razr."
3,crackles,"I purchased this headset a month ago but ended up returning it because I thought that I had recieved a lemon. I ended up exchanging for an identical model which is still plagued by what I call ""crackling."" Although it is infrequent, it is extremely noticeable to me. In addition, multiple people that I have talked to comment that they can hear an echo of their own voice immediately after they talk. Also, the pairing process worked well for the first model, but is inconsistent with the current one. Another problem I've noticed is that if any object (walls, PANT POCKETS!) comes between my headset and my LG vx8100 phone, the above problems magnify (even if I'm well within the recommended 30 foot range.) I'm not sure if these problems are universal to all bluetooth headsets but I plan to exchange this for the Jabra BT800 after a few more weeks of trial period."
2,Looks cool but...,"Like most Motorola products in my experience, what it has in sharp looks and neat features it lacks in durability or real life functionality. I had to return it because it was simply not loud enough even at the max volume for anything louder than a completely quiet room or car. Went with the Samsung WEP150 instead. Not as good looking, but at least I can hear whoever is talking to me!"
3,Bluetooth Headset,It works well except for two things. It doesn't fit well and needs more volume for noisy environments. Half the time it seems to flop around on my ear and I need to adjust it and in a noisy car or on a city street it needs more volume.
2,Already stopped working,This is the second Motorola HS850 headset I have purchased and both stopped working after a short period of time. The very first Motorola HS850 I had came from a local office supply store and it worked for a very long time. These two I ordered through Amazon have been terrible. They both started out ok and each one stopped working. The latest one lasted one month. I can hear on my end but the person can't hear me. I won't buy another one. I will fork out the money and buy one from the store. I thought I was saving money by ordering through Amazon but it has cost me more in the long run.
5,Response to your email,Excellent performer as I have come to expect from Motorola products. Top notch.
4,CONVENIENT HANDFREE DEVICE,"I really like this product, the blue tooth link is great. You cant quite walk 30 feet away, but close. It takes a little bit to get used to having something hanging on your ear, but after a while, you do."
3,Color Mismatch?,"[Update: 03/04/07]I called amazon customer service and they are going to send me the grey piece at no extra cost. They are even paying for return shipping. A good start. As far as call reception etc. goes, the volume was a tad low than what I expected initially. Callees had no trouble hearing me. Did not try while driving a car though.I received this from Amazon today. However it is black instead of grey."
4,An excellent buy!,"Well...I didn't take a lot of time on which Bluetooth headset to buy when I looked for several different kinds on internet and stores. I had Motorola Razor V3 model and HS850 has so far turned out to be an excellent buy for me! I'll be short here...Positives: Very clear and extremely convenient to use, 5-stars to the ""charge-life"" (I charge it once or maximum twice a week), goes easy on both ears, very light.Negatives: When the volume is on High, the listener on the other side may hear his own sound (I have to lower the volume to avoid this). Another downside (I am not sure if you will call this a ""Downside"") is that when I use this on trains or traffic areas, this headset pickes slightest of the noise in the background and the person on the other side of the line might get irritated a bit.In the end, I am happy with this little thing."
3,Not Easy to Hear Me,"While I have no trouble hearing, people I am talking to have a difficult time hearing me while using this product."
4,Bluetooth Headset,The only negative comment about the headset is that it doesn't stay around my ear very well. The sound is very clear except when it is extremely windy.
4,Great Headset for the Price,"This is a great Bluetooth Headset - especially for the price. The automatic shut off via the little microphone arm is slick. I also noticed that they improved the volume of the speaker lately (my dog chewed up my first one, and there is a noticeable difference in volume).Bottom line - it does a great job, especially considering the price. They seem to discount it heavily, making it a great buy."
3,meh,"it's kind of quiet, even on its loudest setting, but it's fun to play with, flitting the boom and earpiece over and over again... i got it for my ps3 and it doesnt seem to work with that, but it does work with my Chocolate phone. then again, maybe im not using it right..."
5,Blue tooth,"This is very small and compact. I really like it, tho at times there is significant static. Well worth buying!"
4,Necessary and okay,"California will require hands-free talking on July 1, so I began looking for a solution. This product came at a great price and was from a reputable manufacturer. It synced easily and operates well, I just have to hold it toward ear at times or sound diffuses elsewhere."
5,Extremely satisfied,"This baby is a monster. It functions great and the on/off button is simple and easy. Basically, on means its fully expanded, off means its folded. All of what I said before goes into the trash when there is a moderate wind present. It does poorly when it is windy and for me it sometimes doesnt pick up what I am saying. Overall it's a good product, not the best, but then again, compare the prices."
3,Good one,"Good headset. For me, I didn't experience the muffed sound issue like some other reviewers said.But I do find the earhook is extremely uncomfortable. I used motorola and Jabra ones before, this one is extremely uncomfortable to wear.The pairing at flipping on boom is fast and reliable."
3,hs 850 bluetooth,Good product for the price. There is some feedback to the person calling. It picks up background noise easily. Easy to connect with phone and simple to use
1,Not so good,"I bought this to use with my work phone, and the quality is so poor that I cannot use it at all. It is comfortable to wear, and incoming calls are clear enough, but everyone I talked to while using it said it sounded like I was talking on a cheap speaker phone. My set was a complete waste of money, and I would not recommend it to anyone.I looked for a bluetooth that would ship directly from Amazon, hoping to avoid the whole counterfeit thing. I don't know if my set is a knock-off or not, but at this point it really doesn't make a difference."
3,Bluetooth,"For the most part the unit works pretty good. distance isn't very good, and at times a lot of static. Over all, I am happy with purchase."
3,Bluetooth Headset,"The headset works okay, but it does not hold the earpiece tightly enough against the ear, so this affects the ability to hear through it properly at times."
3,Overall good headset,This is my first Bluetooth headset and i am pretty much contented with what its offering. Compatible with my mobile phone Motorola v600 and Razr V3. I normaly use it while driving and the voice is quite clear on both ends. The only problem i see is the headset doesnt hold much battery power. It needs to be recharged quite often. The headset is quite bulky as you can feel it in your ears. Bluetooth headsets are not in market for a long time so i dont expect much either.Overall a good handset.
2,JUST OK,"This headset has far from great sound quality. Whenever I walk around people tell me it sounds like I am outside in the wind even though I am not. I hear a small amount of static coming through the headset which my previous headset never did (Jabra BT800). The one feature that I do really like is the flip mic boom. It really helps save the battery since you can simple open the boom to answer a call. While the boom is closed no batter is being used. It also feels more comfortable then the Jabra BT800. If the sound quality were to be greatly improved this would be a great headset, unfortunately it's not."
4,Works well,The Blue tooth was received timely and new in the package. It works great. My only problem is getting it to sit snug on my ear. They all seem to be built the same though.
5,excellent,The product came in its the original package and was in very good condition.I have no regrets at all on buying it from this vendor. It's working perfectly. I can heard the conversations clearly.I'll recommend it!!!!
3,a lot of static & uncomfortable to wear with glasses,"I just got this, and if it wasn't a gift from my girlfriend I'd be sending it back immediately. I can hear a constant static hum on my end, and the people I call complain that background noise is terrible when I'm in my (new, relatively quiet) car with the windows up and radio and air off. I have a very cheap Creative headset that isn't as pretty, but the sound quality beats this one hands down.As mentioned in other reviews, it is very uncomfortable to wear with glasses."
2,HS850 first time user,Fair quality. Lots of echo on receiving phone line. Manual very confusing to a new user. Hard to get phone to link up to headset. I bought three for family members and all of them are having issues with this product. Only by reading reviews was I able to clear up my issues.
1,HS850,"Initially, the HS850 functioned well and effortlessly.The one great feature about this product is the instant connection that is established when the boom is extended. Beyond that, I cannot recommend the HS850 to anyone. The rubber seal that is suppose to reduce noice for the wearer does not work well and after 60 days, it fell off! Motorola does not offer replacements and even if they did, the design does not allow for re-installation. Eventually this unit failed to re-charge. For a company that prides itself in being a Six Sigma company, they sure have a crappy product. Don't waist your money on this lousy product!"
1,Bad battery (?),"I received this product, charged it up, and it worked with my Treo 650 right away. I was very happy for about 15 minutes until it started acting strange, like the battery had died. I repeated this process several times and came to the conclusion that the battery would only hold a full charge for ~15 minutes.Motorola's return/replacement process is a pain, I had to make 2 calls to customer service to get an RMA #, had to send the product to their returns center at my own cost, and still waiting for a replacement.During the few minutes that it worked, it seemed to work well, but this is not a great first impression!"
1,Used Headset - Not Working,"Donot buy this particular headset, i ordered a new headset and was sent a 2007, used, not working, scratched headset. The charger was from an old 2007 cingular phone + free bluetooth set.The headset didn't even get charged, leave alone work.Better buy a retail packaged headset for extra price."
1,Absolute Garbage,"After receiving the headset I plugged it in to charge and no lights came on. Did some basic troubleshooting (tried other outlets, verified I had the charger inserted correctly) and could only get the charge indicator to flash once, then shut off. I returned it via Amazon and received a replacement, which actually did charge. The problem is, when i disconnected it from the charger for the first time to use it, the headset simply split apart in two halves and the guts of the electronics spilled out.Don't bother with this, get the Motorola H700 which is excellent (cheaper on Newegg than Amazon)."
4,Good Bluetooth devise,"I love this devise. I only gave four stars because after a few times using it, it became a little loose on the ear. But still love it because of it's clarity and easy use."
1,Device does not working,I bought this product from CCMACCESSORIES. As soon as I get it and depiste all my efforts to set up. Wont work
5,looks like and works like a charm,"The HS850, I believe, gives you a bigger bang for your buck. I was a little skeptical that it would work given the lower price. When it arrived, I charged it up, and tested it. The skepticism went away. It worked flawlessly. Voice reception is clear and it pairs well with my Samsung cell phone. This item comes in bulk packaging but otherwise is the same as the in-store item. The HS850 also comes with an ac charger only. I spent an extra 3 bucks for a car charger. Still a good deal and easy on your wallet."
4,Great Headset,I used the original HS820 for years which was a great headset. This HS850 seems to match the quality of the original HS820 -- not the cheaper ones rolled out later -- with added convenience of the boom for on/off function. Sound quality is good and device connection is very easy. I've connected it to my Treo 680 and Blackberry Curve. I take this over the smaller dysfunctional brands or models any time.
3,Great Headset!!!!,Product works great at a great price. It connects and disconnects from my cell phone much better than the previous Motorola Bluetooth Headset that I own.Only problem with purchase is that the wrong charger was sent with the headset. I already had one that worked so I could still use the product.
2,Big Dissapointment From a Major Recognized Brand.,"I've had this for about 8 months, VERY DISSAPOINTED. very low volume, can barely hear callers. Callers can barely hear me. The over the ear style headset doesnt seem to fight tight enough, and if you happen to jerk or move your head very fast, the headset almost flies off. I do also get a little bit of ""bluetooth static"" MY BIGGEST PROBLEM, is that for some reason this thing randomly places call, when I dont even touch the headset. I'll be drivng along, and my headset starts ringing for no reason. IT constantly did it, and became annoying as I could not shut off the call with the headset, and had to fidget and try and get my cell phone out of my pocket to end the call. I replaced it with a Jabra 250v and absolutely love it. Dont bother with this headset, although its fairly cheap online, as compared to the $80.00 at most retailers, you'll be extremely dissapointed."
4,Awesome Headset,"I live on my phone as a network engineer. I have to have clear calls and LOTS of battery life. This headset DELIVERS! It is small enough that I can put it in my pocket on the rare occasions that it is not appropriate (meetings, etc.). It does not get in my way while working. It is light and comfortable to wear. It was easy to pair with my Nokia 6102i. Since I bought this, I rarely use the headset to talk with."
1,Device not durable - piece of crap after couple of months of usage,"After using the headset for 3 months, I had the following issues- the plastic thing that goes over your ear loosens up and the earpiece becomes loose around your ear- when you open the mic, there is an on/off mechanisn that brings the device on. A small pin does this. After using it for a while, it eats away the coating and the device does not sensed by the cell phone.- the soft rubber aroung the speaker portion comes breaks away.Overall, this device may look, work good initially but not durable over 2 - 3 months depending on usage."
2,"""I'm sorry, what did you say? I can't hear you.""","As a sales person, I'm on the phone constantly in my car, so I wanted a high quality bluetooth headset that would last for awhile. From word of mouth I heard that the HS850 was a pretty nice bluetooth headset. After buying it I was impressed with the small size, light weight, and flip open mic. It configured easy with my blackberry 7130e phone too. However, after having it for a few days I quickly found out that it severly lacked proper amplification. It was very hard to hear people on the other end and I found myself pushing the headset against my ear just to make it louder. Just to give you an idea, the volume at high was about 1/4 of the volume if I was just listening to my phone without the headset.In the end I returned the headset and got a plantronics 320 which was about half the cost, but with much better volume control. I would recommend this to anyone that is in the car alot and needs a dependable bluetooth headset."
2,Disappointed,"I have an older model Bluetooth and I had much better sound quality with it. This one, the sound quality is barely audible!"
2,Very disappointing,"The headset is flimsy, which wouldn't be a big deal, but the moving part (the flip-out boom) is sure to break at some point. I will never buy a headset with a moving part again.The biggest problem with this headset is the volume. I cannot hear the person talking with the volume up on the phone, and on the headset, when I am in my car on the interstate, with the windows up and the air conditioning on. If I turn off the air, I can press the headset against my ear and then I can hear. I have normal hearing and a quiet (fairly new) automobile.People cannot hear me, either, very well. I have to speak very loudly for them to understand what I am saying.Buy a different headset -- this one works, but it's not very good."
1,Just returned it,"During the first few days it worked only OK - down hill from there. No one could hear me. ""Are you in a tunnel?"" ""Is it really windy there?"" ""Are you vacuuming?"" ""HELLO! HELLO! Is anyone there??""After that, the phone kept disconnecting from the device. I had to reprogram the phone to ""find"" the headset five times in just a few weeks. Then I started getting a message that the signal was too weak - even though the handset was only three ft away!"
1,I had a bad experience,"It always says week signal. At the begining, I thought because it's not fully charged but now even though it's fully charged, my handset show week signal. Hard to talk using this Bluetooth handset. I advise look for better one."
3,Close but not quite,"Good reception on both ends, links up quickly when opening the mic.The fit doesn`t feel firm,,tho not too bad.Actually was happy with it outside of the fact I couldn`t hear unless there was little to no background noise. Had to have the windows up in the car, and even turn the blower down. Was much better if I held it against my ear but then, that wouldn`t be hands free would it? The highest setting was where volume should have started at low end.Returned it for a Plantronics Voyager 510 which gets stellar reviews. Still awaiting delivery."
2,Won't hold up with a lot of use!,"Love this ear piece; works great, feels comfortable against the ear...BUT...the soft rubber shroud that fits against the ear rips off after wearing it for a few months. This was my second one and both have ripped the same way. I contacted Motorola to see if they had a replacement piece. They don't sell replacement pieces, but did offer to exchange it. I've only had this one a few months, but I wear it every day. It just won't hold up to a lot of use. I'm now looking for a different one!"
2,HS850 Bluetooth,"While the unit works well, the price is no bargain. You can buy it in stores in its original wrapping for the same price and not pay shipping costs."
2,Didn't live up to the hype.,"I chose the least expensive model for this device. The concept is a good one; however, the voice activation feature is inaccurate. It dials the incorrect party often. More times than not, it does not recognize my voice command, thus, I am reduced to using my handset to dial.The earpiece does not fit my ear and often shifts while I am driving (even though I have an average-shaped ear, close to my head). I press the device close in order to hear properly. In addition, I cannot tell when the device has turned itself off. The device is worth what I paid for it, no more. Do yourself a favor and buy the higher-priced model. Better yet, go to a store to experience the Bluetooth (or some other brand) before you purchase same. The engineer who designed this model needs to go back to the drawing-board."
1,Returned it,"I've never returned anything in my life to Amazon, but I returned this. Terrible sound quality, unable to have a conversation without the other party saying ""What? What? What?"""
2,You get what you pay for.,"This headset was a great price, but not worth it. When I used this headset, I could barely hear the person on the other end even though I had the volume all the way up. Plus, the person on the other end said it sounded like I was very far away and couldn't hear me well at all. I'm looking for a better headset. Buyer beware."
3,Nothing to get excited about,"I was motivated to buy this headset after having done some research online. Even though it's relatively simple to use and the range is really great, the sound quality is poor. The set can be within 2-3 feet away from the phone, and quality at times is really pathetic. The set cuts off about 1-2 seconds at the beginning of a new call, and the sound drops on and off for a split second here and there. The sound quality I get reminds of the early days voice over IP when using dial-up.I tried the set on both LG VX-8600 and VX-8300 - the sound issues are nearly the same, though I'd say it tends to work better with VX-8300."
1,"Can't recommend this, it's trash","Headset worked fine, but fits poorly on the ear, swinging out and in, feeling like it would fall off, very distracting. Can't seem to adjust it to hold against the ear.I treated it with care, but within a few months the plastic shell began disintegrating, cracking and pieces falling off. Now the control button is apparently shorting causing my phone to randomly redail numbers. I expected alot better from Motorola."
2,Low Sound/Low Tech,"This headset was simple to set up. It's not pretty or nice to look at. It's a Motorola so i figured it would be worth the money I paid (close to $40). My first problem is that even at max volume, it's hard to hear anything coming out of its speaker. It really serves no purpose as a hands free device because you have to practically push it into your ear to be able to hear something. I'm not hard of hearing so i know its not me."
2,Not a total loss.,Uncomfortable on ear. It hurts the top of your ear after a short period of time. Speaker is flat and sometimes has to be pushed to your ear in order to hear the caller. I definitely would not buy this again.
2,HS 850 Bluetooth,Product would not charge. Returned to distributor since they said they would send me a replacement. Three weeks later I still do not have the product.Gives Amazon.com a BAD name
4,Motorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset,I recently purchased 2 of these units and although I had some minor problems getting them to work on my LG phone I managed to get them working. Calling Motorola and LG was of little help since I wasn't using their compatible system but I was able to figure it out. The headsets work good now if ATT/cingular only had a better service area without all of the dead zones it would all be worth it.
3,Not very durable.,I have owned three of these headsets. They work great for a month or so. Drop them once or twice and thats all she wrote.
1,Substandard,"I previously had purchased another Motorola Bluetooth headset (700 series) and loved it so I thought this would be a good product at a good price. The HS850 has several flaws: 1) Fits very loose on the ear, cannot be tightened and thus loses volume and sound quality, 2) The headset dials the last number whenever you open the earpiece or adjust the volume (whether you want to or not, 3) If you do get the headset to connect and work properly, you dare not try to adjust the headset fit or volume, the device will disconnect or dial another number (it is possessed). In fairness to Amazon, I have not tried to return the product. The headset was less than $40 bucks and wasn't worth the trouble. The problem is with the headset and not Amazon, they have been very prompt and professional in their service."
1,sound quality unacceptable,"The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing. So its almost useless, if you travel in a train, a noisy car, or just any other environment, where you typically want to use a wireless headset (you are probably not going to use it when camping at Lake Placid)."
3,Too Big,If they would have made an adjustable ear piece I would be much happier. It's practically unusable for me. The slightest movement and the thing falls off. Must have been made for people with ginormous ears!
1,Piece of Crap,"I got the bluetooh headset that they said was new, and it wasnt. the piece of crap stopped working after a week. I was pretty dissapointed with the headset, not to mention I was lied to. You cant win them all. I guess that is what you get for half the money. a product that is a pile of crap. I recommend paying the money and going to a store."
1,Practically unusable,This headset only works well in a very quiet area. Any noise at all like driving and it is useless you cannot hear the other person well enough for even basic communication.Our telecom manager ordered some of these and all were exactly the same...unusable.Do not get this headset if you plan on going out side of a sound proof room...Very bad design.Do not listen to the 5 star ratings...they have to be Motorola planted posts.
2,Could Be A Better Fit,"Audio quality is decent. Little if any problems with my phone recognizing the headset. However, my chief complaint is the manner in which the headset attaches to the ear. My ear is average in size and shape, yet this headset flops around whenever I move. In order to use it I have to sit or stand still. It's very disconcerting to have the headset move away from my ear whenever I bend over to retrieve something or lean my head over."
2,Good for 3 months,"This worked well for me for 3 months, but then it started acting up. First, it would randomly automatically redial numbers. Then the start/end call button became ultra sensitive and would turn the headset on/off with just a shake or slight movement. The random automatic redial is especially annoying. But, prior to these problems, it worked like a gem."
3,"Well designed, except for volume","Nice little device that's reliable, easy to use, and convenient.Unfortunately, because it fits over the ear, not inside it, it's quite hard to hear conversation unless one is in a very quiet environment with little ambient noise.Apparently, this is a problem with all of the over-the-ear headsets. Next time, I'd go for an in-ear piece unless technology changes.Michael Locker MD"
3,Works very well but needed replacement after 1 week,"The microphone stopped working after 1 week. So far, after getting the replacement promptly sent to me by Mototola, it seems to have good performance, and I like the fact that folding the mic boom shuts the unit off, as well as making it compact when not being used."
4,"Fantastice product, works great.","Fantastice product, works great, better than my last Motorola Bluetooth. Had to mark it down though since the up/down volume button was hard to locate while on the ear."
2,Average review is right on - low volume,"Just packed up the unit for return. I didnt want to believe the negitive reviews about volume, but they are 100% accurate. And it has nothing to do with ""volume orietation"" which only flips the volume buttons for left/right ear configuration. And on the other end...I get reports of an echo all the time. Just like most reviews said!Motorola just came out with a ""stereo"" bluetooth headset, and it better be an improvment on this thing. The 850 works ok, but again...volume is everything. If you cant hear the person, what good is it. ALSO, regarding the new stereo unit (which seems so cool and a good idea)...VERIZON customer beware...their phones to not permit MP3 music to be played via bluetooth. HORRIBLE!!!"
2,Not good enough for the price,"When I need handsfree the most, driving in a car, the 850 lets me down hard. Even with windows up, radio and a/c off, the road noise is sufficient to drown out the voice of the caller with the volume on both my phone and the 850 at max. After about two hours of talking, the signal is too weak to stay connected to the phone. Nice try, but not good enough for the price Motorola ia asking."
2,Poor volume and ruggedness,"As many other reviewers have stated, the max volume on this headset is not loud enough for outdoor environments or even in the car at highway speeds w/ moderate road noise. I definitely recommend using a headset w/ an in-ear earpiece (rather than the on-ear earpiece of the HS850.)Even worse is the fact that this device just isn't rugged. I carried it around in my pocket all the time. After about a month, the 1-touch button started flaking out a bit. (i.e. I had to press it several times in order for the button-press to register.) Then after about 3 months, the button just stopped working. As a result, the headset is unusable."
1,not for use in the car,"If you're looking for a bluetooth headset to be hands-free and wire-free in the car, don't waste your money on this one. I find it completely unusable while driving. Even at maximum volume, calls can't be heard over the slightest background or road noise. I find myself holding the headset with my hand, trying to mash it into my ear to hear anything at all, but in fact I might as well be holding the cell phone to my ear. I have no problem hearing the cell phone."
1,Terrible audio,"The audio on this unit is terrible. I used to have an H700, which I loved. I thought a newer model would be even better. Wrong! There is a delay in responding to the phone. When my phone says, ""Please say a command."", all I hear is ""...mand."" I did not have this problem with the H700 using the same phone.There is a lot of static on receive. The audio level is too low to hear, even at the highest volume setting. This must have been known by Motorola, but their solution was to add a little rubber gasket around the speaker. Very uncomfortable on my ear.The store (DBROTH) I bought it from does not take returns unless it is unopened. Do not buy anything from DBROTH if you want the option of returning it if you are not satisfied."
3,stupid charger,"The headset works fine, is clear, etc. but the charger is not compatable with anything else. My old Motorola H700 had the same ""USB"" type charger as my Blackberry (and many other things around the office) so I was able to charge it up where ever. now I have to use the specific one that came with the headset. Very wasteful and frustrating. Everything should use the same charger, in my opinion, but that would be too efficient, I guess."
1,"""are you in a tunnel? i can barely hear you""","i received the hs850 headset as a gift/hand-me-down and it has never worked very well. it is uncomfortable, static, tunnel-like sound, difficult to hear the caller, and callers complain they cannot hear me. it's small and i like the flip piece, but other than that...it has no functionality. i just got the blueant Z9i to test out. hopefully it will perform better!"
1,SENT IT BACK,"We got a bad one, person talking sounded muffled and lots of static. Tried it on 2 different phones and same results, sent it back defective. We'll do some research and try a different model now. Too bad, I have another friend with one of these and he loves it, sounds great on my end when we talk...."
1,bulk packaging = counterfeit,"I made the mistake of buying this in ""bulk packaging"" a few months ago. It comes in a ziplock baggie, with a cheesy printed insert having a hotmail account for questions.The sound quality sounds like the person on the other end is stuck in a well, and the whole thing feels cheaply made. The earpiece is covered by a thin and uncomfortable membrane, which isn't standard for motorola. Its counterfeit! Don't buy items like this without their original packaging!"
3,meh....,"I bought this to mate with my V3 but ended up being disappointed.The headset is very light but I found it uncomfortable. It never felt secure and I found myself constantly messing with it to try to get it to fit. I'm sure that this will vary from user to user based on the shape of your ear.The sound quality was very good and the instruction manual was easy to understand.I liked the folding boom/power switch but it dropped calls even in ideal conditions.Pros: light, great sound quality, comprehensive manual.cons: uncomfortable, dropped calls."
3,Okay product,This headset works great except for the following:Not loud enough for drivingDoesn't fit to my ear that well.
2,"Makes you sound muffled, hard for you to hear","I like the look of this headset, and I really like the fact that flipping the boom turns it on and off instantly.However, the Motorola HS850 performs much worse than my much older Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth Headset. Everyone I call indicates that I sound muffled, and callers typically ask me to discontinue the use of the headset. Also, the earpiece speaker is not that loud, so it is rather hard for me to hear callers when there is background noise (e.g., in the car).I just purchased this a couple of weeks ago. I am giving it to a friend and ordering a different one (Plantronics Voyager 510?)."
3,Good but....,"I went through a bottle in two weeks. It takes A LOT of shampoo to distribute throughout your hair. I have long hair and have never had to use such a high volume of shampoo at one time. It took over a tablespoon of shampoo everytime I washed, whereas with other shampoos I used a teaspoon. It smells great and seems of high quality. I love the conditioner that accompanies it."
3,"has soy ingredient, would not have bought had i known",soy is not a good product for men to use because it affects hormones in your body. had i known i would not have bought it. i called the vendor and they refunded my money. average quality.
2,"Dry, Dry, Dry","After reading these reviews, I bought this shampoo. It does not lather well, and makes my hair super dry. I do have fine hair, but this did not work well for me. Prefer Ultra Swim"
2,Not so great for my hair,"I wanted so badly for this product to do great things for my somewhat fine, straight tresses. Unfortunately, within a few days, my hair was seriously dried out, even with the use of the conditioner in the same line. Also, I tend to have an allergic reaction to many organic or natural hair care products, and this was no exception. Within a few hours of my shower, my scalp and hair line were itchy and full of little bumps. I tried for 3 or 4 days but finally conceded that this product wasn't for me."
5,Shampoo,This is a wonderful product for any hair type. I have used organic herbal shampoo for 30 years and this is the best I have found. There are 3 ingredients in it that will help prevent flaking scalp. I never have to use a dandruff treatment.
1,Mattes your hair,I ordered this shampoo for my natural 4b type hair. Once I used the shampoo my hair was so matted that I could not run my fingers through it. I ended up using another shampoo on top of it to get rid of the roughness and matting the shampoo caused. I would not recommend to anyone.
1,Worst Shampoo EVER,"I paid over $10 for this stuff and it is an absolute nightmare. The shampoo is like trying to work glue through your hair. You have to use SOOOO much and your hair ends up feeling like it has sludge in it. You cant even get your fingers thru it (and I have soft water!!). The conditioner is fine but the shampoo is terrible. My hair still ended up turning green in the pool and this shampoo did nothing to prevent it nor get the green out. What a waste of money! I'm going back to the health food store and demanding my money back. I posted a similar review on Aubrey Organic's website, I doubt they'll even post it. This product may be ok as a simple shampoo for little boys with no hair but if you have blonde hair or any hair at all--this shampoo will tear the crap out of your hair."
3,Just ok.,"This shampoo was just ok. I only use it on my scalp and it leaves my hair soft and clean feeling without feeling stripped.I was expecting a more fragrant, herbal scent but instead it smelled faintly of what reminds me of an unused cigarette. Kind of like a faint Tea/Aloe smell I guess you could say too. However, the scent doesn't last or anything and really isn't too big of a deal.I won't buy this one next time, I will try another."
3,Not very good.,"You have to use a lot of it and sometimes with regular shampoo, to have both shiny AND clean hair."
3,Good Value for the price,"Have had this product for a month now, and I have to say it does a pretty decent job.Installation was straight forward just plug in the required devices power them up & that's it, no configurations needed.My biggest problem thou; is while surfing the web on Vista with this device connect I would lose connection via web browser, (can still use skype, yahoo, msn), which is weird. I don't get this issue while using Windows XP, or linux.All in all I would say that if you are looking for a low cost switch to connect like an xbox 360, PS3/2, etc, with a PC this is for you."
5,Just What I Needed,"My connection setup is pretty basic, just needed a couple more wired network connections in my office. Plugged it into my Lynksys wireless router, it worked first time out, has been about a month now with no glitches, all I can ask for."
1,No plug-n-play with this item,"This is a simple switch, you plug your network cables in and go. But I had the same slow blinking port light that another reviewer mentioned. I tried exchanging it for another unit, but got the same results. Customer Service couldn't help me, email to tech support has gone unanswered for 8 days (and counting). This switch was supposed to be connected to a D-Link router DI-524. But for some reason, this switch is not compatable with it. I've ruled out bad cables by attaching a different switch and a computer to the router(using the same cable), both worked fine."
5,Quite energy efficient,"I have few Ethernet switches, but all were few years old. Some were running at as much as 100 watts when using 3 connections, and they were not even gigabit switches! After replacing an old one with this, I measured it's power consumption with a kill-a-watt meter, and it says 2.1 to 2.7 watts! This would save me about $10 per month (assuming $.15/kwh).I bought this when it was on lightening deal for around $10. I would buy more as necessary, even if it is $15!"
4,"Work well, price is bargin, but power supply failed in 1 year","Works very well and the price is good. I have 3 of them with power supplies failed in just over 1 year. The power supplies will have the power lights on but no link for any connection. As soon as I install another 5V DC power supplies, it works again. All 3 of them failed within 2 months of each other and has been put in work for just over a year. Other than the power supplies, this product works very well."
3,Better than wireless,"We are trying to cut back exposure to wireless signals in our home so got this switch to replace wireless router. Running two computers on this unit. And works ok, have to hook up in order not skip a slot on switch for it to work. Instuctions on use poorly written and of no use have to figure out for yorself how to use, but is simple unit. Adequate for home use."
1,Failed lt a year & lousy support,"My dlink des-1105 has failed after less than a year, and d-link support sucks, I emailed support three days ago, got a reply today telling me to return the unit to point of purchase - after 30 days-yeah right- or call tech support, which 1st runs you in circles and then puts you on hold for 20 minutes before dropping your call - they're all cheap chinese c**p, the difference is in the support, personally I think I'll just trash the dlink and try the linksys"
2,topical but ...,"Watt describes himself as a ""kind of a Muslim"" (paraphrase) but he is actually an Anglican priest! He writes a history of Islam in the belief that God(Allah) made Islam triumph. So every now and then rational discourse just vanishes. It is also of the ""X in year Y"" style. Dull but not without some worthwhile information."
1,Overdone and not well played,"I suspect the person asking 30 bucks for this CD has no idea how bad it really is. The orchestral playing is very unrefined and the interpretations are way too emotional. Play this music straight and you get all the emotion you need. If you find this CD at your local flea market for less than 5 bucks, it may be worth it just to hear how Tchaikovsky should not be played. Otherwise, simply ignore the 30 dollar asking price here."
2,A dud from Deighton!?,"A clumsy story by one of my favorite authors. Pitchers, quarterbacks, and point guards all lose their extraordinary skills, or at least have bad days, so why not writers? Any ""Rockford Files"" script gives us a better exasperated L.A. anti-hero than this Mickey Murphy stereotype. The minor characters in _Violent Ward_ are almost as cartoonish. (And what's with the title? It's pretty bad when the blurb has to try to explain it.)Deighton's over-detailed descriptions of clothing remind me of a Nancy Drew novel. But the worst part of reading _Ward_ is the feeling I get that this is a British writer pretending he's a lifelong American. Britishisms such as ""rang off"" instead of hung up and ""ramp"" instead of driveway reinforce this irritating dent to the story's credibility.Other critics ask, Well, what's a spy novelist to do now that the Cold War is over? Hello-oh. . . China, Iraq, Japanese industrial espionage? I'll ring off now."
1,sorry not for me,"I tried to follow the stories but had hard time generating any excitement, i did not finish it, would not have bought it but it wa recommended by billionaire author, buy something else"
3,"Clear and Simple, but Maybe too Simple","I read this book as part of a masters program on project leadership. While the book pretty clearly identifies the different types of management and business organizations, it seems to suggest that some of these types are necessary depending on the maturity level of the organization. It seems to not really address how some of these types are necessary for organizational success but some actually harm organizations. It was one of the easier books I have read on leadership, because it clearly puts things in simple boxes. I fear the reality of life is a bit less clear."
4,Very Appropriate for Today,"I've spent most of my career working for large corporations and ever since I read this book, I find myself noticing things I never really noticed before. I feel the book is really spot on in describing the change in behavior of an organization as it grows. When you consider it in the context of all the corporate scandals over the past few years, it becomes even more relevant. It really foretells of corporate excess and creative accounting to prop up the bottom line as a company enters the ""aristocratic"" phase.I really recommend the book, especially if you have spent a lot of time working in corporate America."
3,"Excellent Idea, has some flaws in execution","Loved the concept the author is attempting to illustrate. Has lots of applicability to individuals as well as organizations. Some examples, however, stretch credibility. The example used in the book as a ""Profit"" was probably the worst that could be used because the history shows that figure was very much more the Barbarian described in the next chapter - just read that historical figures primary literal achievement. In fact, much of the historical figures used as examples had a very white-washed/political-correct feel to them which significantly detracted from the author's message.Recommended for the concept, but not for the execution."
3,Almost Excellent learning resource,"I highly recommend this if you are serious about learning the language -- or one of the other languages in the series.Caveat: This Arabic volume uses not only transliteration but one of the WORST transliteration schemes ever devised (e.g., treating d-D, h-H, t-T, ain-hemza, th-TH, s-S as one letter each). -MINUS ONE STARThe series is also expensive since it must be ordered-shipped from Europe. -MINUS another STARBUT, I typed them into the free Pauker flashcards (SourceForge.Net) and then learn(ed) the most common 2000 words in the language -- along with my OTHER studies in the language this really speeds up comprehension.Too good to pass up though."
1,Not what is promised.,"This is terrible. Not in Arabic, only English transliterations. Not key words, simply 100 Units of 20 unrelated words. No sentences to show how words are used. A waste of time and money."
5,WOW,"I just got this book, and I love it. The author has obviously done her homework, compiling lots of information in a beautiful, easy to use format. I like the fact that she covers Florence, Rome, and Venice, but also leads you off the beaten track to discover some of Italy's special corners. I am buying two more copies as gifts for friends on their way to Italy!"
1,A Real Disappointment!!,"One of the exciting possibilities in visiting Italy is always the hope of finding a local artisan making one-of-a-kind handcrafted items. Thus, it was with great hope that I ordered Ms. Morelli's book, expecting she had trod the out of the way streets to find undiscovered talent. Not so. While the title is Made in Italy, the book really could have been Made on Google. There is little info that one could not find through a Google search, or just walking around the main piazze of the towns listed. And there is much needless fillers: how many times have you yearned to buy a $36,000 gondola in Venice? Or need to be told where to purchase prosciutto di Parma or parmigiano reggiano? You can go to any local supermarket in Italy or the US. This book might be helpful to someone who has NEVER been to Italy as an overview of each region. For anyone else, it's another case of a person and a publisher trying to make a quick buck on people's love of Italy. For shame on them!"
2,Needs to be Updated,I found this book is out of date and should include more of the recent changes in the past 5 years. Italy is so popular that everyone is flying there more often than anywhere else in the world.
3,book review,"If someone is looking for a contemporary viewpoint of humanity, this book is not a good fit. Instead, it does provide some insight into thinking during the author's time period. I thought some of the ideas were rather far fetched, but it would be difficult to demonstrate that the author was just making things up. I did find myself thinking ""Oh, come on now"" throughout the book, but I was reading the book because it had been recommended to me as providing some insights into some non-traditional thinking that bordered on mysticism. I really didn't find that element in the book however.All in all, the book is very dated. Unless someone is doing historical research it probably won't prove beneficial to most readers."
5,Jesus rocks!,"I haven't ordered this YET but I'm planning to! It looks very cool and praise the Lord for the new band! god bless you, ted duffy,"
3,Leather is poor quality but it is well made,"Not what I expected and the color doesn't match the ""matching"" leash at all.. It is also very stiff, as someone else mentioned."
2,not what I expected,I was expecting a very active video to help my child exercise while getting energy out. This video is more of a slow introduction to Tai Chi and other slow moving exercises.
3,Emily Bronte wrote a terrfic and strange book.,"As I read Wuthering Heights I found it strange, agonizing, and a powerful book that every individual should read. The novel cannot be considered merely a love story. Al the character's in Wuthering Heights are punished in some way, with the exception of Cathy and Hareton, who manage to destroy evil in thier lifetime. One theory holds that the story represents a conflict between storm and calm. When storm and calm clash, there is hate and violence. In the story; everything happens through Heathcliff and the distortion of his personality through thwarted love. Another interpretation would be the conflict between good and evil (love and hate). The spirit of the novel is a religious one and contends that for a nature to be fully complete it must make contact with an existence beyond this life here on earth. END"
5,Crystalline wonder,"After 35 years, this remains one of the most amazing piano recordings I have ever heard. The power and poetry of this performance ranks alongside the sorcery of Martha Argerich and Sviatoslav Richter: ranging from the most delicate, tentative suggestion to a fierce, overwhelming utterance.Here we have the full spectrum of Prokofiev's genius: the quirky line that unexpectedly reveals a glimpse of irony or melancholy; the harmony that treads a fine line between searing dissonance and soaring convergence.Yekaterina Novitskaya plays not only with remarkable skill, but with an intelligence that is palpable."
2,Not well researched,"More than half of the hikes in this book are front range hikes. Many of which, I would hardly call a hike because they're only 2-3 miles in length. Many of the great loop hikes in the mountain areas were left out. The authors even admit that some of the ""best"" hikes listed in the book really aren't that great! There are also hikes which I recognize as being mountain bike trails, and who wants to be on a trail with a bunch of mountain bikes whizing by? Now I must admit I did find out about two mountain loop hikes that I didn't know about, so I guess the book was worth buying for that."
4,Loved for Love or Money!!,"Very authoritative, glad to see this updated version is now available for all of us new to collecting. Pictures every line of Roseville Pottery. Very helpful in identifying unmarked pieces. Highly recommend for any collector or dealer."
3,A little disapointing,"I was a rather disapointed with the information given about how to paint these vehicles. Sure, it tells you all about how to add super-detailing elements that no one will notice, and how to convert kits, but the actual text about paitning techniques is nonexistant. If you're looking to learn paitning techniques, be prepared to look at lots of pictures and make lots of observations without any written aid. The title seemed to me to be a little decieving."
4,This is as good as it gets,"This is as good as it gets! Look what you have done is a hit. just like rollover dj and do you wanna be my girl. This cd is pretty good. Just like their others they play it as it is. Not many bands can pull it off and this is it!Buy this and i also recommend get born! okay?They are better then most bands ( like simple plan...those little boys with smaller dreams..like some backstreet boys...or even train.)they got it and so u buy it! cause even though they are no beauty queens they have the voices,talent,and my vote for something i guess you would say."
1,NOT TAKING IN THAT EASILY,Somebody realy needs to take a restraining order out to keepJET and ballards as far away from one another as possible.Sorry not very believable in the ballard singing department.I just don't buy it.
5,Great performances of delightful Russian music,"Personally, I love 19th century Russian music. And few, if any, conductors equalled Svetlanov in conducting Russian music. Therefore, I have thoroughly enjoyed this varied collection of works which presents a treasure trove of wonderful music -- including some well know works but also many other delightful works which were new to me and, I suspect will be new to other listeners as well. If you too like Russian music, please treat yourself to this delightful 2-CD set."
5,Fantastic!!,A marvellous CD. Moving and a great way to be introduced to the amazing and powerful music of the Mighty Handful et al. A must buy.
5,Durable,"Nice product, bought this product many years ago and still working great. Comfortable and durable, velcro is quality. Nice product, bought this product many years ago and still working great. Comfortable and durable, velcro is quality."
2,Boring,This is a 1995 black and white video and is really boring. It deals with Bruckner's days at a spa before he starting writing his great works. It really moves slow and there are few insights into his life. We see that he had trouble attracting women but otherwise there is not much here. Take a pass.
5,Captain Bucko is a Must Read!,"If you've ever wondered where many of our popular everyday expressions come from, you will find the answers in Captain Bucko's Nauti-Words Handbook. There are hundreds of nautical terms and everyday expressions described by the author, Roger Huff, in a fascinating and humorous style. And the author is no landlubber just doing research at a library; he has credentials as a seaman and a professional oceanographer. I recommend this book as an excellent reference source for all who are interested in the origins of nautical terms."
5,Tremendous,"Mr. Evans has done a great job of placing a lot of material in a small amount of space. His concise way of sharing on the subject of HOMILETICS is exactly what the beginner needs. That is not to say that a seasoned minister cannot benefit from this book. On the contrary, I have been preaching for over 20 years and I found his common sense approach refreshing. It never hurts to go over this stuff again. A quick read."
4,Preparing Sermons,"This book contains a complete nuts and bolts approach to preparing sermons. It shows how to structure the sermon, beginning, middle and end, and allows you to mould your subject matter into a format that will be readily understood and assimilated by the recipients. I am using this along with other books with different perspectives on the same subject, allowing me to tackle the preparation and delivery of a sermon with the best content, structure and delivery, starting as a novice. I recommend this as a primer for preparing sermons."
3,Nice,"Nice design, but construction a bit shoddy. Mine didn't sit quite level on a flat surface. Had to do some adjusting. I guess that is to be expected from this Chinese crap we get imported these days. The design makes up for the poor workmanship though. Looks cool with my straight-razor sitting in it, and keeps it secure while drying on my sink counter top after a shave."
4,The Blue Fairy Book,My inner 'little kid' enjoyed these stories.....so I'd say yes to anyone that might ask me if they should buy it...
1,Be very careful of the publisher of this book!,"I just ordered a number of the Andrew Lang books from Amazon. The Blue Fairy Book arrived yesterday, and I could not have been more disappointed. It came in a very plain blue hardback. I opened it up, and NOWHERE inside is Andrew Lang mentioned, nowhere are any of the illustrations, from either of the two other versions I know. The production quality -- the paper, the binding -- is poor, and the ""author"" is listed throughout as ""Anonymous."" The publisher of this book is IndyPublish.com. I don't know the deal, or how they get listed under Andrew Lang, but I recommend that if you want a real Andrew Lang book, don't buy one of the IndyPublish books."
5,Testosterone Syndrome,"The book provided me with all the information I needed for the concerns I had related to testosterone. Easy reading without all the complicated technical and medical terms, which sometimes make it difficult to understand the subject matter."
1,Dangerously out of date,"Although the current printing is from 2007, this book was first printed in 1998, the year Viagra came out. Although it covers all the vitamins, minerals and over-the-counter supplements, from gingko biloba through yohimbe to zinc, it does not mention Viagra! It does cover the use of testosterone replacement in detail, but the information is too old to be trusted. Beware!"
4,for construction,"bought these for a noisy construction enviorment. work very well for impact sounds ( hammers, impact guns,ramsets etc.)and cuts way down the high frequency whine of saws, not as good as head phones, but a heavy enough reduction to be comfortable. as for hearing people talk, it is better than either regular head phones or expandable inserts. comfortable and light. highly recommended. haven't shot any guns with them yet, but that's next"
2,ZEM Passive Hearing Protection,"I purchased this item as a backup to my electronic hearing protection that I use on the pistol range and during hunting.Although somewhat of a subjective opinion, the SensGard seems to be about as effective as solid in-the-ear plugs, but not as effective as over-the-ear passive muffs when blocking loud noises. Normal voice-level sound is muffled, making speech hard to understand."
3,works well but uncomfortable,"I like the convenience of zem. I can hang it over my neck and quickly put them on and take them off as needed. As far as hearing protection goes, they work quite well. However, the ear buds are too large for me so they are rather uncomfortable.I wonder why they can't make smaller sizes?"
3,Disappointing,"Disc 1: 54 min. The video quality is mostly good but does have some color imbalances. There are some great shots of little seen areas from the air that makes this an unusual and interesting video in spots. But the photographer likes to shot down way too often from a low, fast moving helicopter for blurred, dizzying shots. 16 minutes are of towns. But the camera shows mostly streets rather than buildings. There are also a number of close shots on the ground of people engaged in various outdoor activities. Often only the people are shown excluding any background.Disc 2: Over America, bonus disc. 79 min. The video quality and photography is much better. There are a lot of city shots, but unlike disc 1, buildings are shown, rather than streets.The narration on both discs are best muted. Little information is given and it sounds like very sappy poetry written by the Chamber of Commerce. All information on locations are in subtitles."
4,ok,some assemblly required I still have to take it to a gun smith-I dont like word requirements on a voluntary statement
5,Bright sights,Got these for my Ruger P90 and i'm very pleased. Their very bright and even help with daytime sighting. Front piece does need drilling so had my gunsmith install.
4,A great book for a ortophaedic view!,"This is a great book for those who seek for a orthopaedic view in sport medicine. Each part of the body is studied, including physical exam, treatment of injuries and return to activity. A good book for the physician improve the musculoskeletal medicine. Although, the book have short information about training, nutrition and supplements."
4,A Favorite,"I don't know how they make these - the quality is quite good. The double wall is very effective at keeping cold drinks cold. The only reasons I don't give it 5 stars is because it is rather large in the hand. Some people may like this but not everybody. Also, I believe it's better to clean this type of glass by hand which some people may not like doing. But the concept is good and it works. It looks interesting, invites comments, and as I said above, is of good quality."
3,Disappointing on several levels,"I am perplexed as to why the reading level for this book is given as ages 4-8. The text is so minimal as to be almost useless in introducing young kids to the sights and sounds encountered at a fair. The illustrations, although bright and eye-catching at first glance, are actually rather scary if you scrutinize them. The people's faces are amorphous and blobby. My two young daughters (ages 5 and nearly 4) love fairs, but they are only lukewarm about this book."
4,"Nice ring, but....","My husband picked this ring out because he thought it was cool that titanium is so strong. Well, yes, but 6 years and too much pizza and it no longer fits him. That's his fault, but titanium's strength is also it's weakness. You can't re-size it if you need to."
5,My kids love it,"Yes, Daddy.This book goes from easy, mild, moderate to very hard questions. It covers mostly everything you want. We got some answers wrong becase you have to think before you asnwer."
3,a non-book,"As the reviewer from mexico notes, most of the chapters of this book are reprints of previously published articles. This make the presentation disappointingly repetitive."
2,OK but still not practical enough,"The author makes a great contribution creating the awareness that KM is much more that IT, and that it is about creating new knowledge and organizational learning. Although the idea is not new, he presents it through an interesting framework called the Knowledge Life Cycle. Thats great.On the other hand, since the book is a compilation of previous papers from the author, I feel that he repeats the same ideas over and over again. I couldn't find explicit evidence of the aplication of these ideas on the day to day work. I also see a contradiction in the sense that he says that the new KM is more about creating new knowledge, but it seems to me that he is trying to create new knowledge through the re-frasing and re-naming of other author's ideas. Please...don't throw more ""fancy words"" to the KM arena, it is already full !"
2,Not as good as I'd hoped.,"Informative. Gives lots of information on the area, but the video pictures are not crisp. I particularly like crisp edges and sharp details when it comes to photography so I find this disappointing. If you don't mind ""soft-focues"" scenes, you might like this one."
5,Truly the world's most comfortable pen,I have been using the Sensa pen since they first came out. I still have & use the original from over 10 years ago. I only bought this one because I wanted a black Cloud 9 style. I have given them as gifts & everyone loves them. I personally prefer the Cloud 9 style over the original because it uses a regular Cross refill instead of the harder to find & more expensive Fisher pressurized refill. Regardless of your choice they're all great pens.
4,Excellent planer,I bought this machine when Amazon had a ridiculously low sale price to replace an old Grizzly that had seen better days. So far I've used this planer exclusively on walnut and have had absolutely no snipe. I had some minor alignment to do out of the box but it only took a couple of minutes. I think at the regular price I would hold out for a stationary planer but I would have to rate this one right at the top of the lunch box planners.
3,"Minutemen's 2'nd not their best, but still packs punch","Supposedly a full length album, this second document of the Minutemen's strength runs no longer than most ep's, and should really be considered as such. That said, it lags sadly behind the awesome ""Paranoid Time"" which came before it, and doesn't have a song as neat as ""If Reagan Played Disco"" on the ""Bean Spill"" ep which followed it. So what does The Punch Line have?It's got lots of neat stuff like ""Search"" and ""Gravity"", but most of these sounds were better fleshed out on later albums. If you're a collector, (or just along for the ride) stop here and have a listen. Then move on to the REAL thing... The Minutemen would not look so back again."
3,handle came off after 6 months,"It was installed about 6 months ago and today I noticed that a screw (at least I think it was a screw) under the inside lever handle either broke or fell off and the handle was left in my hand off the drum when I opened the door this morning. The lock works so I pushed lever back onto the drum but it loose and still needs to be fixed somehow. Before this happened it worked fine. Hopefully, I can find a screw to fit inside the opeing that holds the lever. I've had Baldwin locks before and they were of very impressive quality, that's why I bought this one. I guess they don't make them as good as they used to anymore."
4,Worked like a charm,"I bought these to replace some older filters that smelled a bit moldy in my 2000 528i. Not only did it solve the smell issue caused by the mold, I think these work better than the stock filters ever did!"
1,Does Not Fit 2004 BMW 545i even though Amazon system says it will,Title of review says it all. Do not buy this filter for a 2004 BMW 545i as it will not fit.
3,Not bad but not great,"I thought this book was ok but nothing great. i thought ""Legions Of Fire""was a better first book to a three part series than this book. I have always thought the telepath plot was ok but it is just an excuse for more action. This book explains everything that happens before hand. Im more interested in political intrigue with the ISA,centauri,narn,Drazi etc rather than the arch with the telepaths.That is why I found ""Legions Of Fire"" to be more entertaining. Read this book if you find the telepath plot interesting but if you didnt care much for that plot skip it"
4,The begining of the Psi Corps is very interesting,"This story was a little confusing and difficult to follow. After I read it for the third time,I think I understood it much better. I was able to understand more about the Corps and enjoyed learning, while trying to chase down rogue telepaths. A must for any telepath, psi corps or not. ""The Corps is Mother, The Corps is Father"""
1,hard to follow action story,"I was hoping for a more thorough explanation on how the Psi-Corps got started - what motivated the mundanes and the telepaths. How did something that should have started as a gulag get so powerful?Instead we get an action story. That in itself is not bad, but there's not much character exposition so I couldn't tell much difference between the Psi-Corp telepaths and the underground telepaths.A wasted opportunity that could have been much more."
4,"A good solid read for B5 fans, or even those who aren't.","Keyes has written an excellent B5 novel with none of the B5 characters in it. This first novel of a trilogy sets the tone, and lays down the groundwork for the novels to follow. B5 fans will enjoy the plot, and the references to ancestors to some of the B5 characters we know already. Readers new to the B5 universe can enjoy the story apart from the rest of the arc, without really missing anything. A good read, and I'm looking forward to the other books in the series."
5,"Excellent, I could not put it down.","This was unexpected in its detail, wonderful in its links to past and future and quite thoroughly an excellent read. Not what I expected at all and I only hope the next two are as good."
3,A good book,"After reading (and enjoying) this book, I realised that it should not be judged in relation to the TV show. It is canon, as are most of the Babylon 5 books, but it does not somehow completly click together with the TV show, and the arcs in it. The telepath arc here is far too Earth-tied to do that. But as a book itself, it is very good. We get to see what happened since the beginning of the telepaths, through the arrival of the Centauri and so on, up until the birth of (SPOILER). We see brilliant political machinations, ancestors of telepaths in the show (Lyta Alexander, Talia Winters), and how the Psi Corps slowly gets more and more power. We also get well thought out characters, and most of them are not what they seem, although I felt that some stories were rushed. I would say that this book is worth buying by Babylon fans, especially if they like the telepaths stories. Those who prefer space battles/aliens/wars should maybe look for it at a friend's house."
5,"A great B5 Book, the best in this trilogy","This books goes further into the past with the B5 plot then any book did before. its writen well, and despite the fact that it happens well in the past, its still a great reading for a B5 fan.it was a pleasure reading it again after the nightmare trilogy of the passing of the thecho mages."
2,Tries to do too much.,"I went into this book looking forward to learning more of the history of the Psi Corp, the group I loved to hate from the Babylon 5 TV show. I was disappointed, however. This book covers the birth of the Psi Corp after the discovery of Telepaths on earth. It also covers the resistance movement during the early years. However, it tries to cover too much territory. The action takes place over 100 years and includes a couple generations of characters. As a result, it doesn't appear to be really focused on anything or anyone. It comes across as more of a history then a novel.This book is interesting reading for the Babylon 5 fan, but not an engrossing novel. The other two books in this trilogy do focus the characters and action more, so I hope that when I get a chance to read them I will like them better."
2,Seems like his outline was overly broad,"The book covers a huge swath in time and a great many characters. Unfortunately, I found it hard to focus on any aspect of the story line because of this. The writing shows some workmanship, but I never got the impression that he really took ownershup of his subject. Don't be fooled by the book cover, either, there's only the tiniest bit of the Bester character in this one."
1,Tries and falls flat,"Babylon 5 is one of my all-time favorite shows. I decided that I wanted to see what else was offered in JMS's amazing universe and happened across this book first. I thought that learning the origins of the Psi Corps and the station's favorite telepath would be fun. Instead, I dragged myself through page after page of dull accounts and rapidly cycling characters and political dullness. I'm hoping that the books about Londo Molari are more interesting than this one was."
4,Babylon 5 backstory,"I very much enjoyed the details that ""filled out"" the B5 universe. The questions of how and why things became their current form has always interested me. The fact that J. Michael Straczynski has shared his detailed outline with other writers is great. I would have given this book a 5 star rating on content and story but I took a point away because of some technical writing errors. Any fan of B5 would enjoy this book."
4,At least I like it,"This book is about the discovery of telepaths, the results of that discovery, and the creation of the Psi Core. This is get another book where Keyes really does his research. You get the origin not only of the Core but of Talia, Lyta, and Bester. I really enjoyed the book.I'm seeing a lot of critism I agree with about the book being difficult. Yes, at time it is. That's because of the shear lenght of time covered. I thought that each character was well developed, especially considering how many their are. I don't know if non-fans of the show woud like it. Another thing some people may not like is that it doesn't deal directly with anyone we know, until the very end."
3,Good for Fans,"If you are not a fan of B5. The book does not stand on its own. If you are a fan, you may enjoy learning the background of the Psi Corp and the genesis of the B5 Universe. That said, the book does little to move the characters forward (it takes place in the past) and in a few places conflicts with things in the TV show. Entertaining, but nothing to write home about."
3,A fun read,"I found the way the writer advanced time a bit akward, but other than that the story was well told and the characters interesting enough to have me read the story in a couple of sittings. There are no big surprises for the hardcore B5 fan, but the flavor of the story and the 'I thought as much' value of the book is worth the buy. 'To Dream in the City of Sorrows' was better, but it's on par with 'The Shadow Within'. Go on... you know you want it..."
4,A gripping start.,"An in-depth look at how Telepaths came to ""appear"" on Earth and a somewhat controversial background on the development and rise of the Psi Corps. The book lacked the development of some of the characters, but it was necessary to move the story along. There were a few hidden agendas ala Bester, I might add. Overall, this is a wonderfully, well-written book. The one thing that was not covered was the method used to rate the telepaths. It would have been interesting to see where they drew the line in telepathic abilities to classify the 'P' rating (P1 - P12 or higher). It didn't stop me from reading the trilogy twice so far, and I have begun reading this book a third time. This is an interesting and engaging Trilogy. I highly recommend this book."
3,"A Good Start, But Far Too Broad","Babylon 5's telepath arc never realy impressed me, so I apporached this book with some misgivings. In it, we see the discovery of humanity's telepathy, and how Earth's government reacts. The grand scope of the novel is it's main downfall-- we never really stay with any one character long enough to get to know them well or understand their motivations. However, this book is the first part of a trilogy. The second and third books are much better."
4,Couldn't put it down,"I've read a few B5 books, this is one of the few that I really couldn't put down from beginning to end. Most of the characters are done well, and the backdrop to Earth meeting the Centauri for the first time was pretty good."
2,Poorly Written and Uninteresting,"After reading the Technomage and Centauri trilogies, this the first book of the Bester trilogy was very disappointing. It seems to be poorly written, unentertaining, and understandable only by the most hard core of fans. Those other authors managed to write stories that almost stand on their own, even if you haven't seen Babylon 5 TV series you could get into their plot arcs, care about the characters and be entertained. Even worse it seems this novel entirely lacks the Straczynski-esque tone and humor of those other trilogies that really made Babylon 5 an epic story.This novel may be worthwhile to read only if you are a big fan of the series and you want to learn more canon background information. But a ""technical manual"" might make a more interesting read if that is your goal."
3,The Genesis of Psi Corps,"Interesting in that it goes into some detail about a period of Earth history when telepaths started to appear, and how Earth society dealt with it (hint: not well).Disappointing, though, to those Babylon 5 fans who expect something recognizable from the series. Because it mostly occurs a generation before the events of the TV series, you won't see any of your favorite characters in it. If that's important, then skip this one."
4,very good book,Easy to understand. It is essential to a researcher. It would have been rated as an excellent book if it includes the Matlab programming and Erdas rather than any other software like MIPS.
4,Super Sexy Ex-Biker to the Rescue!,"Back of the Book Synopsis:IF SHE ONLY KNEW...Laura Rhodes had dreamed of striking out on her own. But strange men started following her the minute she arrived in San Francisco. Then, the man she planned to marry hightailed it out of town. Laura was stranded! Until ex-biker Nick Hooper - her fiance's brother - rode gallantly to her rescue.When Nick swept Laura off her feet with a devastating kiss, Laura knew she was in big trouble. Already wary about one Hooper brother, Laura fought against her attraction to another. Was charming Nick as trustworthy as he seemed? He was risking his neck to protect her...and the mysterious package they'd found.Suddenly Laura didn't know which was at greater risk - her life...or her heart."
5,Mind Benders...,"....the world is thousands upon thousands of opticalillusions in this sweeping volume of MC Escher sketches, prints, paintings and other exotica. He's like in the same avante absurdist quantum pocket as Salvadore Dali or Miro, but he's done these imagination bending scenarios in which, por ehemplay, a school of fish metamorphises into flying geese before your eyes, in which chess boards take your gaze into surreal, ultrareal mazes, in which sketched lizards crawl off the paper, become ""real"" for that frozen moment in time and then creep back on to the artists' page...I know I may sound like I've had too much portomento on my keyboard this morning, but it goes without saying, I cannot adequately describe this man's work. If you have not seen any of his work, you simply have to. His stuff is fantastic. When you get this, you will enjoy yourself immensely. You will experience hours and hours of pleasure browsing through the pages..."
5,Where Art And Mathematics Meet,A very good to get a feel for the life and work of a true genius. In mathematics we strive even today to understand the plane as well as M. C. Escher did! His tessellations are still amazing! We bought this in hardback originally at twice this price an never regretted it!
2,Purchase and shipment canceled.....still got book and was charged for it,"I ordered this book and after ordering sent a message to cancel the order. I received confirmation via email that my order was canceled but a couple of days later got the book in the mail and was charged for it. The book's condition is great, but now I have a book that I didn't even mean to purchase and was told that I had canceled."
2,This is a pamplet and not a book!,"This ""book"" is 16 pages of 8 1/2 by 11 paper, stapled to a piece of construction paper. Half of the pages in the copy I just purchased have a big black line down the middle, where the copying machine was not working correctly. It is readable, but it looks terrible. I would be embarrassed to put something like this on the market as a ""book"".The recipes are good, but it looks like something my daughter would make in her 5th grade class. I guess I expect more from a ... book."
4,Nice Door Hardware,"Out of the box you can tell this is high quality hardware -- massive, solid, nice-looking. I gave it 4 stars because of how easily it scratches. I guess the veneer is not deep enough to prevent that."
4,Knee pads,"These do work well, comfortable, for kneeling on a floor with lots of tile chips (tile setter) They stay fairly well. You do have to pull them up every so often. Not as much as ones I have had in past. An issue is the upper strap will ride down in back of your knee and stay there cuts into that area or it comes undone. They are good I give these a B+"
2,eh,"i should have listened to other reviewers when they said they were too big. they are way too big and not very cushy.only pro was that they stayed put very well. didn't keep them, returned them."
3,"After a Strong First Half, ""Spooky Art"" Fizzles","Rather than a book in its own right, ""The Spooky Art"" is a compilation of over 190 different interviews, essays, and unpublished thoughts on writing. Well, the first half is about writing--the second half delves into television and film before settling on criticisms of specific authors (Tolstoy, Hemingway, Lawrence). While the parts about Mailer's career are fascinating, the diversions in the Part II will test the reader's patience. Are you ready to read 15 pages devoted to Mailer's thoughts on ""Last Tango in Paris""?"
2,Backup Mypc,"This product is very slow - 15 hrs for 58 GB is just to slow for me. To make matters worse, it doesn't recognize the full size of my Western Digital external USB HD. The program stops after writing 4GB of data. I'm looking for another backup program."
2,Not very helpful,"This book has decent information for novice photographers who would like to work exclusively with Kodak film and chemistry, but it is of little use to someone who simply wants to take better pictures or who does not have access to a well-outfitted darkroom. All in all, if you want to be a professional photographer, your money is better spent on other books, or even a class."
2,"Lacks ""How To""","Nice presentation actually aimed at ~Novice experience levels with some knowledge of darkroom proceedures. As may be expected, this book concentrates on Kodak technical info, particularly the newer films and chemicals for the T-Max films. Disappointed older films such as Tri-X, Plus-X are omitted entirely. Again, the book identifies many proceedures and processes but doesn't teach the ""How To"" very well."
3,"Mediocre,which is still above avg with MHC","I enjoyed this thriller by MHC. But once again felt there was not enough depth for the characters. More time should have been spent on the relationships of the characters to help me root more for the protagonist. As for the ending, it was way to abrupt. What happens to everyone????"
2,Overwhelming and saturated plot,"Too many characters, stories, and hard to follow plots. Did not keep my interest. Certainly not on par with such masterpieces as ""Contagion"" or ""Simple Plan."""
3,Good book at beginning and almost to the End.,"Actually this was a very supspenseful book, it was well versed.One thing about MHC she doesn't give the best conclusion's. She tends to wrap up and race to finish, leaving readers asking ""what the heck?"" and not giving closure. It is too bad, otherwise this could have been one of her best. Oh well, it is still a really decent story and pretty fast paced. I raced through it myself. I would say read it, with warning it's a bit creepy......."
2,Old book Copyright in 1977,"Didn't realize I was ordering a book that was thirty six years old, and it was rated ""good"". The cover was torn and it was all faded. Haven't read it yet, so it might be really wonderful."
2,Red Dragon for 8-year-olds,"A Stranger is Watching is an amazingly childish book. It is written at the a level somewhere between Ayn Rand and the Hardy Boys (um, the Hardy Boys of course being more sophisticated than Rand). It is every cliché you could imagine rolled into one. It really should be classified a children's book--it has no sex, almost no violence, no psychology, no ""adult content"" or language. The characters are cardboard. It is a Lifetime movie, except without the depth.It gets two stars because I can't say you won't be entertained, again, in the way a Hardy Boys book is entertaining.Here is the best line in the book, just to give you a taste:""The woman fell on her side, tried to speak, 'Knife . . . still in my back . . . help . . . please . . . take it out . . . hurts . . . want to die here . . .'""I'm not joking, that line is in the book!"
3,"""A Stranger Is Watching"" Is The Creepiest Title In History","I don't care a lot for this genre but the title caught my eye and gave me the creeps. Not a true mystery, more of a suspense novel about a race to save an innocent death row inmate's life. Also a love story between the woman working to prevent an execution, and the widower of the woman murdered by the death row inmate. I think the main suspense here comes from the ""will he die or won't he"" rush to stop the cogs of injustice and that surprised me since I thought from the cover this was more of a crime novel. Oh well, it killed a few hours waiting in an airport, which was what I needed it to do."
5,A Stranger is Watching,The first Mary Higgins Clark novel I ever read....(have now read around 15) One book and you'll be hooked. She is an exceptional writer! Just when you think you have things figured out.....you realize you don't...I like that!
4,Quite an interesting book for a thriller lover...,"This book is one of the best from Mary Higgins Clark, although I pretty much prefer her other books like ""Where Are The Children?"" and ""Silent Night"". ""A Stranger Is Watching"" keeps the reader in suspense until the last part, which is what a thriller lover usually looks for. The only flaw about this book is that some parts are overly exaggerated, and that the author introduced quite a number of characters into the plot, which makes it rather difficult for the reader to just concentrate on one of two characters in the story. Recommended for all mystery and thriller lovers out there. This is one book by Mary Higgins Clark that you should not miss!"
3,Not for beginners,This book would fit you best if you already have the knowledge and skill of programming in ASP (VBScript and the ASP event model). As a WebDeveloper you need the knowledge of developing fully functional Web Applications and i think that this book will give you that knowledge.
3,Maran Illustrated Guitar,"I am a guitar instructor at a college and am considering this book for the first semester beginning class. It is colorful, has a lot of information that beginners need, but develops very slowly. I think it is the 5th or 6th chapter that actually gets into playing the guitar. Otherwise, I like it a lot."
5,a new view of the american experience,"From a Canadian viewpoint, this book opened my eyes to a very different view of the American mindset. It was a throughly enjoyable read, full of imagination and history at the same time. The dawn of a new century is always exciting to read about, but with Mr. Vaughan's style of writing, it gave a new definition to the meaning of fun!"
1,Turn of the Century,"Hi,I suppose many people would like this book, but I found it did not hold my interest at all. I read about 20 pages, and then skipped through and read a little more at different points and then stopped reading.I bought this book as the first of a series,and was going to order the whole series ... thank goodness I only bought this one.The author is probably a very nice man, but I didn't ""sync"" with the story.Dr.Jon"
5,My all-time favorite film,"Stanley Kubrick's final film, an exploration of the darker side of relationships and sex, is nothing less than a masterpiece -- a perfect ending to a brilliant career. I will say nothing of the plot because I think this film is best viewed knowing as little about it as possible. Just know that it can open your eyes (no pun intended) to how you view relationships. If you like any of Kubrick's previous work, you're sure to like this one. And it doesn't matter if you never have seen a Kubrick film -- get your start with this one. Cruise and Kidman's performances are flawless, and as with all of Kubrick's films, the production is stellar. I cannot recommend this film highly enough."
5,"Exciting, exciting, exciting","What a movie!!!! What can I say!!! Thrills, chills and spills. Tom Cruise, when he rides that motorbike...it makes my legs weak! Rent this, buy it, steal it....whatever...just see it."
2,Disturbing,"Eyes Wide Shut was creatively filmed but the story was unsettling. Kidman and Cruise are great performers but the story seemed more psychological than it did sexual. By the way, was there any real point? If there was, it was lost on me."
2,It felt like a waste of time,"I watched this film with a friend and we were both becoming irritated with the slow build up and the initial lack of direction. However, as the intrigue and the atmosphere of the film built up (particularly the music in the ""House"" scenes), it felt like we were going to be rewarded with a crunching finale with mind-blowing twists. It wasn't to be: the sense of being cheated by the film's abrupt and anticlimatic ending felt like a violent slap to the face. Having said this, I haven't stopped thinking about the film and what it was trying to say (if anything). Perhaps this was Kubricks intention. We will never now. I will certainly watch it again, but I won't hold my breath...."
2,A Big Disappointment!,"I was looking forward to watching this movie with great anticipation, being a long-time Kubrick fan. What a huge disappointment! In brief, the movie was overly long, the plot disjointed and I never really felt much for Cruise or Kidman. It's too bad Kubrick's final movie had to be this one. Don't waste your time, rent or buy Clockwork Orange or Full Metal Jacket instead."
1,"Warner Bros. Screws Up Kubrick DVD, Again!","A great film vandalised by a stupid decision. Why in the world would Warner Bros. fail to release the DVD edition of this last of Kubrick's great films in standadrd 1:33 format? What is the point of DVD if not to provide home viewers with the highest quality version of its theatrical release print? Why not at least give customers the choice of either format, as so many studios do on their discs? It's a crying shame, an idiotic decision, and one can only hope Criterion will pick up this title and do it justice. Warner Bros. remains at the bottom of the heap for DVD competence and quality."
2,Not a masterpiece,"This movie is bland. I think it's the only film I've watched in awhile that has failed to touch me in anyway be it positive or negative. None of the characters were interesting, and many were one dimensional. Symbolism is everywhere, Christmas trees, visual and verbal references to rainbows, etc. There are plenty of movies out there that are worse than this one, but that doesn't make this a masterpiece. Most of film score was fine except for the somber piano piece which is distracting and takes you out of the action. I'm a big David Lynch, Cronenberg fan, and I can say this movie doesn't rival their best works as one reviewer claimed. I have a general understanding of what this movie is about and can honestly say it isn't very good."
3,"Good movie to watch, but don't buy the DVD","It is really too bad that Warner Bros. chose to release this movie in the R Rated version, rather than the uncut version we heard so much about on the news in 1999. What an insult to Stanley Kubrick's last movie. Not only did they not even include ""deleted Scenes"" as in the Stigmata DVD, they also releases it in full screen! VCR technology on a DVD folks!"
4,kubricks final film,this is Stanley Kubricks( director of The Shining and Full Metal Jacket) last motion picture as a great hollywood director. the leads are powerful and you always gotta have Sydney Pollack fighting with someone and getting angry. lots of nuidty is plentiful in this movie but besides this its a great paranoia and mystery film. works good if your stoned
2,Bizarre,"Maybe it's just beyond me, but people looking for deep meaning in this movie may very well be disappointed. In my opinion it was slow, oversexed and overhyped."
3,"not amazing, but not bad (or perverse)","Eyes Wide Shut isn't as bad a movie as many people take it to be. It is defenitly long and WAY too slow, but it's still pretty intruiging nontheless. It's hardly perverted; if you want perverted, there's plenty of hardcore porn in the world. Most of the nudity is pretty tasteful, not as psychotically erotic as some people take it to be. Still, this isn't Kubrick's best movie, and you'd be better off watching Lolita or Dr. Strangelove. Strange though, how people find this more perverse than Lolita...Overall, Eyes Wide Shut is a good rent."
4,Good but.........no point,"I rented this before, the previews looked interestig so I decided to rent it, well I did see this my friend didn't like it there was NO POINT to the ending.....Tom Cruise is a good actor. Enjoy!"
1,Plodding pseudo-erotic anti-thriller...,"I still can't believe that it took nearly TWO YEARS to film this lame art-nouveau piece. The plot is not cohesive, the acting is in slow-motion and the eroticism is vastly overhyped.Stay away. Check out any other Kubrick film first."
1,Unfortunately I had to give it at least one star,I'll keep it simple. Don't waste your time. This was the worst movie that it has ever been my displeasure to view in a theater. By the end of the show I wanted to strangle whoever it was banging on that [...] piano! If someone other than Kubrick had done it would have went the straight to video route.
1,Don't bother! keep your standard def DVD,"I love this film, but this blu ray is terrible! I have standard definition DVD's with better picture quality! The blu ray is the unrated version but if you have it on DVD just keep that! There should be some sort of regulations on video quality on Blu ray and on DVD's because we never know what we might get. A much better transfer is needed."
2,Pretty boring and ridiculous!,"I hated this movie and am only giving it 2 stars because Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman acted well.The problem is it is poorly written and too far out there even for me (and I like unusual, artistic flicks)I don't want to give away the plot - oh wait, there isn't one!I guess the main reason I hated it was it was too long, too hard to follow, and just sickening.A man tries to prostitute his pre-teen daughter, and that is just one of the disturbing things in the movie.I'm pretty open-minded, but they went just a little too far."
1,Your Eyes Would Prefer To Be Shut ! ! !,"This movie is a waste of time and money. I don't think that the movie deserved that much attention. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are the reasons that people went to see the film...but it isn't their fault, the film was just really..well, your eyes would prefer to keep shut..mine were anyways, I slept through most of it."
1,One of last summer's most boring movies !,"This movie was one of last summer's most boring movies! It was so slow I actually walked out after the chris issak song! I 'm saying this because all the movie we every get in the area were I live are mainstream only! It sucks not seeing what the indie are showing! Heck we're even lucky if we can find any of those movies to rent/buy on DVD! Watch this movie if like Tom cruise,nicole kidman or the director! otherwise avoid this boring ,dull movie!"
1,Where's the Plot?,"I am a Kidman & Cruise fan. But, this film? What a stinker! Where was the plot? The suspence? Any sign of life would have helped. It was just a continous parade of bare boobs. You didn't care that people were threatened. You didn't care that they may have been murdered. The lines could have been read of off a teleprompter! What trash. What a disapointment!I've seen boxes of facial tissue that were more interesting.What a waste of time. Wow! I think I'll go stare at the screen saver on my DVD player! That's got to be more interesting!"
4,sexy thriller,"not a Cruise fan, bought it for the nudity & sex. Did want to see Nicole's really nice caboose. Finally, I do like Sidney Pollack. Buy it for a sale price."
5,Amazing,"From Stanley Kubrick,the Director of ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""2001"" ""Full Metal Jacket"", and ""The Shining"", this MASTERPIECE is what entertainment is all about. It reflects Human Nature in it's truest light, while showing off the acting talents of both Cruise and Kidman. Edgy, eccentric and titallating. One of Kidman's Best performances. From the sets to the costuming, to the lighting and performance, this AMAZING Motion Picture is well worth watching. Mature Audiences, Some Total Nudity and Adult Themes. I give this great work of art and ""A+""."
4,Not 2 versions of the movie,IF it is true and there really aren't 2 versions of the movie it is kind of false advertising. For the shear visuals and atmosphere this is one of his best. Perhaps by mentioning the packaging doesn't match the content there will be a revision to this.
5,Classic Kubrick at His Best,"I loved this movie.It provided so many elements including: Mystery, lust, anger and suspence.A perfect finale to a movie director icon!"
2,Over-rated film,"I don't know what's the big deal about this movie that it's one of the best sellers. It's dragging and pointless. The best part is the conversation (arguement)between Cruise and kidman in the bedroom. Other than that, everything else is just very dry and plain."
5,Wasn' it wonderful,"I found this film slow but insightful. There were a few quick things in it that if you blinked at the wrong time you'd miss it. For example Nicloe Kidman changing her tampon in the beginning of the film. This film made you guess at who was under the masks, and who it was that saved Tom. Many of the people walked out of the theater with me not having a clue what it was about. I like that in a film, it makes me feel like the smart one of the bunch."
1,very slow - like Devil's Own,"This was the second slowest movie we ever saw. We will usually stick it out through most movies to get our money's worth, but my wife walked out within the first half hour. Don't waste your money or time on it. I recognize that Kubrik is dead and it's a classic, yada yada yada, but a slow film is still slow."
1,Kubrick Ends On a Low Note!,"This was By Far The Biggest Movie Letdown I Have Ever Experienced! This Movie was a MESS and So Poorly Done that It is hard to believe that it came from the Great Stanley Kubrick! The Only excuse I can think for this Travesty of a Film is that Mr Kubrick must have been Sick while he was Working on it. Where was all this Hot Sex that was supposed to be taking place between Tom and Nicole. This Film was So SEXLESS that it should have been Rated PG! I actually FELL ASLEEP for a few moments while watching this film, that is how Boring it was! There was No Plot and the Film to me seemed Unedited, even though the official word was that Kubrick had completed the film before he passed away! I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ACADEMY FOR NOT GIVING THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE ANY OSCAR NOMINATIONS! I am shocked that so many of the reviewer's here are raving about this film, they must be relatives of Tom and Nicole! It is a Shame that Stanley Kubrick's Last Film had to be this Turkey!"
2,"A Ludricrous, Stifling Bore","I won't attempt to add much to the conversation, other than to say than to say that I admire Kubrick, but don't admire anything about this film... the scenes with the masks, the dialog when cruise is asked to remove his clothes, is only one example of how poor this thing really is, and if it wasn't a Kubrick film I would have stopped watching right there....save your money"
2,Snore,"This is NOT a date movie. Except for the awesome sex scene and Nicole writhing around, there was not much to keep a man busy. My wife was so turned off I couldn't convince her to get romantic, even after all of the chocolate we had. The story telling was long and drawn out. Nicole does a horrible job portraying this woman; the worst acting I've seen from her. Tom played a believable part but there was too much of 'Tom Cruise' in the character.If..........I...........had.............to........ see.............it.............again............it............would...........be.............by...........myself........."
1,Take out the Trash!,"Give me a break. This was one of the most boring and annoying movies I've ever seen. The music was irritating, the dialog was ridiculous and the ""Masked Party"" was comical instead of erotic. I thought the beginning was interesting but somewhere between the first prostitute and the orgy the storyline lost my interest. The part where the costume shop owner turns his daughter into a prostitute overnight was a real gem. What garbage! The only reason I gave it one star was because the acting was decent."
2,Movie is great; quality of Blu-Ray poor,"Please note this review is not about the movie itself, but rather the picture quality of the Blu-Ray version.I am a big fan of this movie and some of the wonderful qualities of the film are the use of color and the set up of many of the wonderful shots. Unfortunately, the Blu-Ray does not upgrade/enhance the picture quality significantly over the DVD version. Using a Panasonic Blu-Ray player with a 50-inch Panasonic plasma screen TV, the quality of the picture was mediocre if not poor. There was visible pixelation and the colors did not 'pop'. This stands in contrast with the other Blu-Ray movies I have purchased and my OTA HD TV signal. Overall, disappointed."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzz,Was it real? Was it a dream? what the heck? All the people who gave it 4 or 5 stars seem to think they are deep thinkers. I saw the movie and i think you are all reading way to much into it. I mean really the movie is about a bunch of rich people who have orgys in secret places. This movie was painfully long and very perverse. To be honest if it wern't for Kudro or whatever his name is I dont think anyone would like it. I think some people force themselves to like it because they think there impressng somebody.
1,Eyes Wide Shut lives up to its title,"You need to keep your eyes wide shut through this very boringand tedious film. Thank god I didn't waste my time to go see it atthe theater and instead waited for it to come out on video because I surely would have been upset having had spent 3 hours in a theater watching this.There were so many unanswered questions and conversations seemed to take hours instead of seconds. There was no real purpose to this film I thought. It just dragged on and on and on. There were a few things that took me by surprise, but nothing really worthwhile. And the annoying piano music which was also evident in his film 'The Shining' was like listening to fingernails on a blackboard. It was neither ""thought provoking"" nor a ""masterpiece,"" but rather a very overrated attempt at film making. Why people are calling this brilliant and Kubrick's finest film ever I'll never understand."
1,Oh Dear,"Alas, this was not the late, great Stanley's best movie. It only falls short of risable by a narrow margin. ""An intelligent analysis of human sexuality""?..2hrs of pretentious psycho-babble which was so mind-numbing as to hardly be believed....but then again I've seen Dr. Strangelove..."
1,EYES WANNA SHUT!,"THIS MOVIE SUCKED IN MORE WAYS THEN ONE. FIRST OF ALL, TOM AND NICOLE ARE ENDLESSLY TRYING TO KEEP THE MEDIA OUT OF THEIR ""BUSINESS"" SO THEY DO WAHT---MAKE A HOME PORNO? I LOST RESPECT FOR THESE TWO TALENTED STARS. TOM HAS MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 TO BOUNCE BACK ON. NICOLE IT IS GOING TO TAKE AWHILE TO REGAIN ANY RESPECT YOU HAD IN THE INDUSTRY. YOU DIDN'T JUST PLAY A PART. YOU PLAYED A SLUT, WHO WAS MARRIED, AND INVOLVED A CHILD. THIS MOVIE HAD COMPLETLEY NO MORALS, AND WASN'T AT ALL SEXY. KIDMAN AND CRUISE HAD LITTLE SCREEN TIME TOGETHER, MOST OF KIDMAN'S SCENES ARE IN FLASHBACKS OF SEX WITH A SAILOR...GOT IT..LET'S MOVE ON...IT DIDN'T...SO I AM ASSUMING THAT WAS WHAT THE MOVIE WAS ALL ABOUT?"
1,Movie should be XXX,"DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! This movie is rated incorrectly. There should be a better warning of it lewd content. Beware, this is a horribly written/directed movie which belongs among the ranks of B-Playboy flicks for the sexually frustrated, devoutly immoral persons."
1,An incredible job of making sex BORING,"Besides boring, the characters were so unlikeable that you wanted someone to enter the scenes and just slap them. Yeah, this was Kubrick's last movie, but it goes to prove that even good directors can make real bombs."
1,What was kubrick thinking?,"Tom Cruise is a horrible actor who wrecks whatever chance the movie had. This is also one on the most unerotic ""erotic"" movies I have seen. Stay way."
1,Garbage!,"I had never had an urge to walk out of a movie before I saw this wreck. Waaaaay to slow and the acting was horrid. Plus, they took two hours to actually set up what seemed to be the plot, and then they make the ending ridiculously ant-climactic. If you like to be entertained when you watch movies, stay away from this 3 hour long nightmare."
1,Eyes Wide Shut,"When I saw it at the theater during it's first week out, about a dozen or more people left, not because it was controversial....but that it was so damn boring. The person I was with fell asleep in the theater during the last half hour. I wish I could have been so fortunate. I give it 1 star because you don't have a zero stars rating!"
2,You need no imagination,The sex in this was toooo much. I will not recommend this movie to anyone. It had far to much sex and not a lot of content. I was really. upset at the ending! IT WAS STUPID!
2,Sloooooow,"I assume the excessive amount of nudity was to compensate for the absence of an interesting story. At times, the movie progressed soooo slow that even someone with an attention deficit disorder wouldn't have missed anything."
1,Eyes Wide Shut,"They say Kubrick died so that he wouldn't have to see this film. I can only hope this is the case. If you are mired in middle class virtues and have never ventured far from home, you may find this enlightening. Otherwise, this is an ode to the non-adventurous, the non-artistic, and will confirm you in all your beliefs that what you have settled for in life is fine and good. Unless you are very young, or have learned very little in the course of your life, you will learn nothing from this film. As a great fan of Dr. Strangelove, 2001, and A Clockwork Orange, I can only say that we are all allowed mediocrities in our lives, some earlier, some later. I adore Kubrick's classic earlier work. Unfortunately, this film takes no risks, and therefore does not exist, even remotely, in the same class. Don't waste your time. Remember his greatness...and forget this film."
1,Greatly Disappointing!,"I heard all the hype about this movie, how great the acting was, etc., so I had the opportunity to watch it on HBO. What a disappointment! My view of Tom Cruise has really changed after watching it. Rated R? More like NC-17. The movie left little to the imagination and I found it difficult to follow. Was there really a storyline, or was it a show-all video? It goes to show where people's mindset are these days."
4,Eyes Wide Shut,"Another great movie that brings out intense emotions. Unfortunately, the US edition is censored. Will not buy until the Australian uncensored edition becomes available."
5,absolute beauty of a masterpiece........,"i stayed away from this film in theatres and had no plans to rent or buy it! i did and was i floored! it is an amazing, haunting, mesmerizing, classy piece of work! terrific screenplay, awesome musical score, and probably the finest performances of mr/mrs. cruises' careers! mr. kubrick has left behind for us to savor over and over an instant classic that will be viewed and talked about for many years to come. the vibrant colors and the dolby digital ac-3 sound are amongst the best i have seen and heard to date. this is one of the highlights of my dvd collection. get into it, savor it, you will not be dissappointed!"
4,Eyes Wide Open,"Stanley Kubrick's final film is truly one of mystery and intrigue. Eyes Wide Shut was a deep journey of one man's darkest thoughts and the surroundings that beckoned him into his sexually frustrating situation. Every scene is intricately done, with each character taking his/her full fifteen minutes in front of the camera. As I progressed further and further into the core of this dreamlike drama, I found myself wanting more and more of this intoxicating film. The best part of this movie is its wide interpretation left for the viewer to fill. If you watch Eyes Wide Shut, come with an open mind and be ready for a deep analysis that will make you appreciate this film's content."
3,Haunting ...but little more,"Sometimes Kubrick's work is all at once wonderfully disturbing and entertaining - 2001, Strangelove, Clockwork Orange, The Shining.Eyes Wide Shut is haunting and entertaining also - but the mystery of this movie has very little supporting story compared to the rest, which were rich all around.Regardless, Kubricks unnerving eye is in full effect here and Kubrickians will get their fix - albeit more methodonal."
3,Waiting for Kubrick's true vision..,"I attended the theatrical release of this movie with some trepidation, not that the movie was a critical flop, but because many minutes of the film have been removed so carelessly to meet MPAA rating requirements (a great example is the cut away from the Cruise/Kidman scene at the bedroom mirror) It is my assertion that the deleted scenes/digital modifications reduce the emotional impact of key plot elements and the interplay between central characters. If you would like to see what Kubrick truly wanted the film to portray, consider waiting for a (as yet unplanned) future release which presents the movie in a 'Director's Cut' format."
4,A film as enigmatic as its director...,"Kubrick's final film is a fitting tribute to its visionary director. I have watched it several times and each time it leaves me with different ideas, questions, and theories. The acting is incredible (including a surpisingly good performance by director Sidney Lumet), and the cinematography and photography reveal Kubrick at his best since ""Barry Lyndon"". ""Eyes Wide Shut"" will please Kubrick fans, however it may purplex and bore mainstream viewers."
3,"Not a great movie, but a great code to break",Go to YouTube and watch one of the countless videos decoding this movie. It's apparently some kind of coded message about the Illuminati - although I'm not sure they actually exist. It's fascinating to see the film's ideas and images analyzed through that lens. Just as The Shining is best viewed as Kubrick hinting about his involvement in the possibly staged moon landing and how that affected his relationship with his wife and children.
2,Wrong wrong wrong,"You folks are nuts. Sorry, I adore Kubrick myself, but this film is just terrible and in Ameria the most beautiful photographed scene is exasperatingly mauled.I've no doubt it might have turned out better had Kubrick had more time to tinker but in its present form, aside from his ever skillful camera direction, the film is utterly mediocre. Several scenes make the teeth grind. The acting is abominable - Nicole Kidman acting ""stoned"" is eerily like William Shatner.Alas, if only the orgy were intact it might be worth a look but as is, your money is better spent elsewhere."
1,View it on video before buying this one,"I'm giving this movie only one star and it pains me to do that. This movie was so awful and boring I could not stick with it. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's acting are very stiff and forced and that stupid one-tone-key piano playing throught out the movie just drove me crazy. Before the movie was released all any entertainment magazines and/or shows talked about its strong sexual conent. There wasn't a good enough story so the director through in a lot of sex. It sounds just like ""Showgirls"" to be. All that hype and then nothing."
2,"A ""dreamy"" movie that puts you to sleep","The film struck me as though I were watching it after having had as much champagne as Nicole Kidman had at the party at the outset. A slow, miserably trying movie which wants to be something more than it actually is. It did not intrigue me at all, and I felt it that it was something Stanley Kubrick had shot if he were smoking hashish in astonishing quantities. The New York locations were artificially unconvincing, Tom Cruise's performance was adequately lukewarm-like most of his prioir performances, in this viewer's opinion. The story was at best, uninteresting, and, as you can surmise, I felt that this was an instantly forgettable film unworthy of even a second viewing because I found it to be inordinately boring. The only highlight for me was seeing Nicole Kidman's tantalizingly luscious nipples."
1,Don't misunderstand,"I think movie gives great insight to how a married relationship can be, I just think that some of the scenes, however symbolic they are, can be very inaccurate and inappropriate.Tom Cruise plays the part of a devastated husband who found out that his wife ""almost"" had an affair with another man. When he finds out he takes the approach, rather than talk with his wife, we decides to try and give it right back to her by having an affair with another woman. Now some men might have that reaction and immediatley would go to that route, however it takes him to places where sex in meaningless, to the point where everyone wears masks to hide their identity. This may have proven symbolic to what Cruise's charecter was looking for, but not a very good stereotype/generalization.The story is good, the plot completley unbelievable. That is why the rating is so low. Some say it's misunderstood, I think it was mis-represented."
1,Sex lives of the living dead...,"Amazing that anyone would find anything redeeming about this sad debacle. It's Stanley Kubrick doing (serious) Woody Allen, right down to the Sydney Pollack cameo. Stultifyingly paced, it's the best sleep inducer I've ever experienced. This is the kind of vehicle that mainstream hollywood would have cast Michael Douglas & Kathleen Turner in, & that might have given it some humor & punch. The plot is laughable. It worked fine as a period fantasy, but it sure creaks & flops in a contemporary context, not that this movie has any kind of context at all. It's strangely a-contextual. There's not anything resembling a real live 3-d human being anywhere on the screen. Even all those nude women (no nude men) look like products of a corporate committee. How sad. I'll remember Kubrick for Dr. Strangelove, The Killing & Barry Lyndon, thank you."
3,Somebody Shoot the Pianist!,"Eyes Wide Shut, brings to the screen the story of a couple going through some difficult times in their marriage. ""Curiosity"" will test the couples' resolve and inner strength, while their very life might be on the line.On the positive side: a) Great casting i.e. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are wonderful, b) significant elements of eroticism/some really good nudity (!!!), and c) excellent costumes Renaissance-style.On the negative side: a) The movie is super/uber/ultra slow (!!!), b) The music (if one can call it that...) might make you want to throw things at your television set so make sure you remove all dangerous items from the vicinity, and finally c) the very poor dialogues/lines for which the writers are to blame.In conclusion, the film may provide for an evening's entertainment, though it's no masterpiece..."
1,What a nightmare!,"The music, nerve jangling. The movie, absolutely one of the WORST pieces of trash I have ever seen. It is beyond my comprehension how people could like this movie. It moved at a snails-pace and the actors looked as if they were sleepwalking through the entire film. I didn't like or feel empathy for any character in the film. It was just too weird with too much going on! I've liked some of Kubricks films, but not this one. People are just making a big fuss over it because he's dead."
1,NOT A GOOD FILM,"This is a very bad movie. The acting is poor, the script trite, and editing less than decent, and the plot has more holes than swiss cheese. This movie was entirely bland and Nicole and Tom had no chemistry to speak of. The beginning of the movie was embarrassing and foolish. This movie gets two thumbs down, and all ten toes for that matter!!!!!!!"
3,Eyes Wide Shut,"My wife and I saw this a while back when it first came out, we decided to buy it in blu-ray. It's a different kind of movie just figure out some of the movie...."
1,eyes wide shut,The title says it all keep your eyes wide open because you will get bored so quickly they will slam shut. LONG AND BORING FILM for sale any takers. If all you want to see is Nicole and Tom well that's ok if you want to waste your hard earned cash its ok if you want to stay awake do not waste your money. Sorry guys you completely lost the plot.
1,how can i rate crap?,"Okay I know that some people like movies this lame but to me this movie just out right sucked! I am not a fan of Kubrick's the only reason I saw this was because my brother said the movie was good, and come on! I was generally apalled at the poor excuse to make an edited porn for people too watch that wasn't rated NC17 or XXX...it was just stupid, and very sad. I mean this movie had no real plot. It is about a Doctor who gets involded with hookers and cheating on his wife, (not like it doesn't happen everyday) evntually finding out about gatherings that this group of maniacal party goers, who have big orgies. This is the basic plot, the music is diturbing only because it's got a shallow repetition, and the acting was terrible. Now the direction i don't even want to go there, come on Kubrick...I mean geez...Anyway, the basic sum of this evil is that it sucks, you shouldn't waste your money watching a damn three hour movie of crap!"
1,A pointless movie,This movie has the most juvenile plot that I've encountered since 'Swordfish'. I can just imagine a bunch of 16 year old boys commenting on the cool T&A. I love quirky movies. I enjoy leisurely pacing. This movie is just dumb. And Nicole Kidman can't act (Tom is not much better).
2,More worth renting than buying...,"I found myself minimally entertained, though mostly annoyed while watching ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Though the plot was provokative and thought-stirring, the way each character seemed to speak in the same repetitive manner got under my skin after the first 10 minutes. For example, someone would say, ""I think you life's in danger."" And the other person would reply, ""You think my life's in danger?"" This echoing went on in every dialogue exchange. It was nice to see Tom and Nicole together, but the roles didn't seem to bring out the best in them."
5,Buy this DVD,"this is a great film. view it more than once. like spielberg said, kubrick's films grow on you. the special features/interviews are worth the purchase of the DVD."
5,Watch It Again And Again,"The best movie of the year! Kubrick gets performances from Tom Cruise and Nic Kidman that far exceed anything they've ever done. Soundtrack is really wonderful. I watch the movie again and again. And I would recommend watch this movie repeatedly, because, as with all of Kubrick's films, they simply get better the more you view them.I simply love this film. But this VHS tape still not available in Russia. So I was forced to buy an illegal VHS copy from a street seller for $2.5. The copy is not good but contains the orgy scene."
4,In Classic Kubrick Style..A Dream-Like Masterpeice!,"As with all of Kubricks great films, he has spared no expense when it comes to detail...Amazing cinematography, beautiful set design, costumes, and camera work. But we all know this alone does not a great film make...remember Dune? What completes this prize is a fascinating and mesmerizing story, richly marinated with complex characters and bizzare situations. This film brings to mind other classics like After Hours, The Wickerman, and Blue Velvet...A noble, abeit, naive man trapped in a fools game. I admit that I feel Cruise has been miscast (not Kidman, however), but he delivers an impressive performance regardless. Yes, it IS slow-moving...it HAS to be. Yes, it IS overkill..It is MEANT to be, much like Tommy or The Wiz. EWS i"
1,Ban this DVD!,Not only does this movie NOT contain the original version as filmed by Kubrick--it is FULL SCREEN! Can you imagine not having a widescreen version of this film? Don't buy it!
2,Order the DVD from Europe/ get Zone 2 player,"This version was corrupted in Zone 1 by US Censors actaing against the vision of the Director. Unfortunately, having died he wasn't around to rectify the problem in a ""Director's Cut"". The closest to that would be a European version that is uncut -- unfortunately even the European version isn't full screen. Note that you must have a modern, zone-selectable DVD player to play alternately Zone'd movies. Make sure the zone is manually ""lockable"" as some movies won't play in multi-auto-zone players. Don't be held hostage by the US censors in the ""land of the free"".-l"
2,Not HD Quality!,"I was expecting a much better video quality in HD but I do not see any difference with the regular DVD format! I guess there's not much to improve on, scenes are mostly in soft, almost filtered quality shots!HD is more impressive on sharp images and high contrast. This is a waste of time and money on transfer from DVD to HD-DVD!"
2,Over-rated film,"I don't know what's the big deal about this movie that it's one of the best sellers. It's dragging and pointless. The best part is the conversation (arguement)between Cruise and kidman in the bedroom. Other than that, everything else is just very dry and plain. If you like the combination of Cruise and Kidman, then you've gotta watch Far and Away. Now, that's a quality movie!"
2,dissapointment,"The fact that the set design and cinematography were the best parts of this film proves that Kubrik finished his career with his worst film. The score had to be the most monotonous thing that I have ever heard, and this is one of the many places where Kubrik's films usually shine. Add to that awkward dialogue and a poor performance by Nicole Kidman, and you have a movie that I wish was never released, for Kubrik's sake."
1,Tedious and uninspiring,"This was a BAD movie. Not only was it boring, it also gave you no emotional connection to its characters. The main revelation seems to be that, (NEWS FLASH!) women think about sex, too. I was especially saddened that the conclusions the couple reached after their mutual mistakes were that 1) the word ""forever"" made the wife nervous and 2) they needed to go home right away and ...s. And this in the midst of a crowded department store while taking their young daughter Christmas shopping. Wow! That's romantic! Talk about the love of a lifetime! I'm sorry that Tom and Nicole wasted so much time and effort for so little reward."
3,Not bad...despite Cruise and Kidman,"I realize this is supposed to be dream, etc but is it inappropriate to judge the perfromances as if they were real people, who actually exist?That said, its a good story. Tom Cruise is his usual phony self, as in his second meeting with Sydney Pollack (who's outstanding, BTW). Tom ""emotes"" by covering his face, rubbing his eyes and doing the hand clapping thing he's been doing since Risky Business. Its Tom Cruise in a brilliant portrayal of...Tom Cruise.Nicole Kidman can act, but is playing herself as well (ice-cold). It DOES make the other women in the movie seem that much more attractive. I suppose this forshadowed what happened to them in real life.Still, its an interesting story and if they're gonna spend as much money as they spend making Matrix or Hulk, might as well get a story to go along with it."
1,"Bloated, distended, and lurid as an over-sated royal corpse.","Even the superfluity of formal nicety can't redeem this pretentious movie by one of cinema's most over-rated directors. What of it is being celebrated as psycho-sexual insight is simply platitudinous. Kubricks's despotic and fatuous self-assurance is oppressively evident in its merciless length, its arbitrarily long pauses in the midst of vacuous speech, its gratutiously voyeuristic nudity, and in the directorially enforced blandness (and, on occasion, freakishness) of the acting."
2,"Decent story, but poorly done.",I was curious so I had to watch this movie. I did not understand any of this movie other than it seemed like Nicole's character expressed concerns about their sex life and then Tom's character explores an explicit sex realm. It's like a couple hour hardcore porn with a story is how I saw it. I honestly did not like this movie as I saw no point to it. It's good for in-depth thinkers but terrible as entertainment!!
2,Unsmurfy...,My wife and I did not enjoy this unsmurfalicious film. It was so not up to par with the rest of Kubrick's films. I'd rather sit and watch Gargamail sing happy songs to butterflies than have to sit through this junk again. This was one smurfed up film.
2,Disappointing Swan Song!,"Stanley Kubrick will always be my favorite movie director, right up there with Hitchcock and Scorsese. But this film is not one of my favorites. The story line is confusing. There are some scenes that are unnecessary (i.e. the doctor with the prostitute). And the length of the movie was brutal. The film could have been chopped off by an hour. As for the sexual content, I thought they could have used more of it. It was a let down. This swan song was a sad ending to a brilliant career."
2,hated it,"This film is apparently not lacking reviews. Here's my $0.02: I don't only go to the movies for action or drama; I find many artsy movies to be entertaining and enjoyable. But with any 'art', appreciation is entirely subjective. To me, this was a painting you'd find in a modern art museum. The one that looked like a monkey splattered the canvas with paint. Beautiful? Maybe to some. Call me the kid that says the emperor's naked, but this film failed to touch me on any level. I could write paragraphs like most of the other reviewers, but there's really no need. I do not recommend this movie not because it's art that I don't appreciate, but because in my opinion I don't believe that it's art at all. Obviously, though, there are others who disagree."
2,Good movie but not worth all the hype,I thought the movie was good as it dealt with subjects rarely touched on without titilation - Cruise and Kidman do pretty good in all this and the movie is worth watching but unless you are the biggest Kubrick fan this movie is only average. I think it got all its hype because Kubrick died before the movie was released.
3,"""B"" For Effort",I think this is a film I ended up wanting to like even though it veered off course several times and made me wonder whether the director knew where he was going. What made me hang in there were the performances of Kidman and Cruise (though I thought there wasn't enough of Kidman!). Both exude a very strong screen presence and have plenty of chemistry together (surpise! surprise!). It's one of those films I would sit and watch again to try to understand it better and to figure out exactly what Kubrick ultimately was hoping the viewer would come away with -- and why he had such a hard time conveying his message.
1,Do Yourself a Favor: Rent before you buy!,"I didn't see it onscreen and daringly bought it in DVD format. However, my SIXTH SENSE (subtle promo here) said, ""Rent it before you open it."" I'm glad I did. I expected a picture with eroticism, kinky behavior and, well, soft pornographic filming. It was a little erotic, the impression of kinkiness was attempted, but I've seen harder porn in a Disney movie.I'm the type that likes plot with my erotic filming. I'm not into anything which earns the XXX rating. But I thought this movie would be a little more ""open."" The moment you think you will see something, clever camera angles cover the ""good stuff"". I found ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down"" a bit more sensual. Neither are pornographic, but can get you going.This is only my opinion. However, I strongly suggest you rent it first."
1,Tom Cruise did it again - -,"- bombed, that is. Oh, as a kid fighter-pilot, semi-terrific. As a lawyer in a uniform, putrid. As a ""doctor""? He was unbelievably bad, totally miscast. A fish out of water? No, worse. Much. Like some of those terrible movies we love to hate, I actually watched it again -- or, perhaps 17 minutes of it, until I wanted to watch Lassie re-runs or 'most anything..... so I did, ""Inside the NFL"" - - - fini."
1,Are you sure Kubrick made this film?,"This movie was just plain bad. I have seen basically all of Stanley Kubricks films, and unfortunatly his last was his worst. The story was just so wierd and twisted I didn't even want to finish watching the movie. With all the hype this movie generated, and the actors in the movie, i thought this would be great. Just turned out to be a stinker.Hopefully Steven Spielberg can do Kubricks other project AI some justice in the future, but its unfortunate that this movie had to be so bad."
2,EYES WIDE SHUT,"Kubrick's last film does have some merit as far as story line with special emphasis on a suspensful plot. However, the chemistry between Nicole and Tom is virtually nonexistant. They really seem to do better with their performances apart from each other. The middle of the film is filled with mystery and intrique and will hold your attention. The story is based on a surrealistic theme of immoral sex and debauchery and if you can overlook the disappointing climax and wade through the scenes in which Tom and Nicole overact, you will enjoy the film. This is definitely not for children 17 or younger but a non prudish wife could enjoy it with you!"
1,Worst Movie of the Year,"Save your money, this movie is sick. I like Tom Cruise (or used to) but this is awful."
1,"Maybe the worst, most boring movie I've ever seen.","I knew I was in trouble when after 2 hours I was still waiting for this movie to become interesting. The only thing worse than the picture itself was the three note ""sound track"" played by a guy with one finger. If you must see this movie, I'd rent it and only if you can't find ANYTHING else to rent."
2,"The last, but not the best","Exactly where was this film going? That is the question. Unlike other reviews, this is not one where the reviewer liked the film. I am still waiting for the point of the movie to be made. Where is the rest? So much ado about nothing. This movie is not misunderstood. It's just not finished. Large portions are missing, like plot, substance and cohesiveness. There were many rambling conversations reminiscent of Woody Allen but not half as good. Dark and eerie - yes. Thought provoking - no. Lots of questions - but few answers. Up till the end I was wondering how Cruise and Kidman could star in this cinematic, clearly expensive, excuse of a B movie."
2,Not the UnRated Version,This version of Eyes Wide Shut with the picture of a Mask on the Cover Does Not Contain the UnRated version of the film.The back cover states it contains both versions. This is not true.

2,Pretentious and repleat with outdated,"Stanley Kubrik is old. Or he would be old if he weren't dead. This movie would probably have been a very probing look at sexuality, inhibition, jealousy, conspiracy and corruption... if it were made 20 years ago. Today, you have to look at the characters and events and just say ""Give me a break."" This film is more pretentious than dull, and it is very dull. Although this film is primarily struggling to shock you and challenge you on topics that have been addressed a hundred better ways, it is technically beautiful, and the characters seem exceptionally sincere. It is a beautiful movie in exactly the same way that ""Lost in Space"" was beautiful. Technically well done, but painfully amiss on story and perhaps simply ill-conceived. Watch ""The Wall"". Watch ""9 1/2 weeks"". Watch something better."
2,Is Nicole Kidding?,I thought this was the worst movie I have seen so far this year. The sex stuff was good but put it together with a plot that one can follow and an ending that makes sense.
2,From tedious to humorous,"Kubrick tried to establish a unique pace to the dialog that bordered on tedium, at times to the point of being laugh-able. Tom C. was mis-cast, Nicole K. was typically brilliant. Annoying minimalist piano sound track, putrid script, agonizing, purpose-less scenes. Will anyone dare say this is Kubrick's worst work, as it was sadly his last? Don't be fooled into believing this is an artsy, intriguing movie by a controversial director. It really stunk! If you like Cruise and Kidman together get Far and Away or even Days of Thunder instead. Yes, Eyes Wide Shut was that bad."
2,blue ray waiste,buy this on dvd. The blue ray is no better than dvd. This is the worst blue ray I own. Picture quality is poor. I have a new sony blue ray player and a samsung LED t.v. so the flaws really show.
1,Awful and Pointless,"I usually just write reviews for the things I like, but this movie is so bad I was compelled to warn people. My husband loves the movie, and I have no idea why. I like wacky, psychological thrillers, but this movie seems bent on shocking the viewer, without telling much of a story. So, a wife says she's fantasized about someone else, and her husband goes off the deep end, like now he is somehow justified in cheating on her. This isn't enough to drive a feature film. I love Kubrick, but how disappointing that this was his last film. Also, that piano music gets annoying really fast."
2,Overrated Movie frustrates the viewer,"I was very disappointed in this film. I was really excited to see it to begin with but it didn't live up to its admittedly alluring advertising. The problem with the movie is that it leaves TOO MANY LOOSE ENDS! I also found the abundant nudity (which in typical sexist style was only female) to be a major turn off. Over all the film is a total waste of time. Go Rent Donald Sutherland's Don't look now, or Basic Instinct if you want a sexy mysterious movie."
4,good work by kubrick,"This movie is tedious. Never-the-less, the camera angles, lighting, directing and acting make this movie worth while.After watching, I thought about it for hours. Which is the sign of a good movie (in my opinion).This movie was very well acted, and the character's motivation was clear. Even though the story's a bit off center."
4,Very odd film,"It is a very strange film, but I loved it. The images are captivating, and the story keeps you asking more questions."
3,Totally edited with dark silhouettes in the mansion orgy scenes. There.... I said it.,"I think my favorite part is actually the beautiful artwork that is on the walls in the N.Y. apartment by the couple played by Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Or the excitement and wonder that there really could be parties like that. I mean seriously, a 50 person costume-orgy thrown by the ultra-wealthy, social elite in a 50 million dollar mansion in up-state New York? Holy S. This film is incredibly erotic so don't watch it with your family unless you're totally insane."
4,"Not Kubrick's best, but worth a go","The big theme of this movie is the ever-present tension in the human personality between desire and repression, and overall Kubrick portrays that tension pretty effectively. The early temptation scenes are convincing enough, and so is the reconciliation between the doctor and his wife at the end. The problem is the middle section, namely, all those cavorting naked bodies in masks and the ""warning"" to the doctor. This bit was, unintentionally no doubt, as ludicrous as when Vincent Price used to ham it up in the old days. At least we knew Price was doing it partly tongue in cheek. Even a more accomplished actor than Cruise would have had trouble carrying it off with dialogue of this abysmal quality."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,"I consider myself a movie aficionado who appreciates many genres of movies. However, I found nothing redeeming or interesting about Eyes Wide Shut. This movie was plainly and absolutely aweful."
4,A dark side of the world,"A couple live a false happiness according to an old man who shows the young man the dark side of the world. Good film by Stanley Kubrick, whose masterpieces 2001 and Barry Lyndon are well known."
1,Boring!,A catchy theme-tune does not a good film make. It didn't workfor Mission Impossible and it wasn't enough to make this filmwatchable. I hope Nicole and Tom fulfilled some sort of sexual fantasy in the filming of this because it sure isn't going to fulfill anyone elses .. END
1,Titillation and Sensationalism...,"...are cheap and easy ways to get a response from an audience.Did anyone stop to think about the fact that Kubrick chose TOM CRUISE (Risky Business?) and NICOLE KIDMAN, known more for their looks than for their acting ability, to play in his ""intellectual"" film about sexual intrigue?!? Does anyone really DENY that they had hoped/expected some hot sex scenes between Cruise and Kidman, and that they were given that expectation by the trailers?If Kubrick had really wanted to emphasize the sexual psychology in this flick, he would have chosen lesser-known, non-heart throb actors for the roles. To me, it is clear that Kubrick was pandering to his audience. And it is precisely because he underestimated the intelligence of his audience that the film was unsuccessful."
1,The only thing my eyes were doing was fighting to stay open,"I and the entire row of people that saw this movie were bored out of our minds. I actually fell asleep at one point. The charactors were unlikeable. The plot was unfathomable. The ""point"" was missing. And, the story was plain, old boring. I agree with some of the other reviews - rent before you buy or you might be sorry."
1,Not all it's cracked up to be...,"Now, im usually a very open person. I like to try and enjoy every movie I see. This isn't the case. What we have here is a masterpiece gone terribly wrong. The movies 159 minutes is the first thing to yell about. I was so bored with most of the conversations that I fast foward through the whole movie just about. Themovie has no moral, nothing exciting and, excuse me, there was almost no sex. There was more nude girls than there was sex. Now I can see why this movie was so terribly screwed up, Old Stan must have been messed up. Now I loved 2001 and The Shining, but this is one that I will not be adding to my video collection."
1,movie,"I tried to watch this film more than once to see if I ""got it"". I don't care if I did or didn't. This movie was so pointless and long that I just didn't care anymore. Plot:A husband and wife fighting all the time. Find something else to watch if you want to watch something Good."
2,defective dvd,"As a warning: the bluray is defective that I bought. It stops midway through the film. The picture quality is awful. Don't think that just because it is a bluray, that it will hidef -it is no better than a standard dvd. Very dissappointing. Hope this helps. As for the film, well, very slow. Not sure the point of this, long pauses in dialog. Otherwise, interesting pornographic look at jealousy and it's effects."
3,esoteric?,"Was this movie supposed to be disjointed, amalgam of slo-motion scenes? Like a dream perhaps? If, so than it almost succeeds. Almost because the screenplay is so forced and surreal at times that it feels like the movie was directed by One Take Tony.Nonetheless, the movie is worth seeing for visuals and it's uniqueness."
4,Better than Average,"Most agree that this film was directed wonderfully, and I find it to be quite artistic. Everyone interested in film should see this movie just for the images.The story had great potential, but the ending was almost an anti-climax. This movie has much in common with Magnolia; both look great, both are anti-climactic. This story is slightly better than Magnolia, and is obviously directed better. If you've seen Magnolia and you like it, you'll probably like this."
3,Captivating and very bizarre,"What's real? What's a dream? That is the plot here. The suspense built to a fever pitch, but sadly died off. I've read some of the other reviews. Look, some of these people need to get off their pretentious high horse. This movie is good, but let's not start over-doing this as a film ""for people with brains"""
4,A Truly Brilliant Masterpiece!,"""Eyes Wide Shut"" is Stanley Kubrick's final work, and it is an amazing film! The cinematography is vivid and lavish, with strong performances all around. The visuals are absolutely stunning, and the plot is intriguing! Underdevelopment of Cruise's character, underuse of Kidman, and overlength are slight problems, but managable. All in all, it's a truly magnificent film!"
2,i felt it was over rated,"the film moved really slow. so much that I got up to bake cookies during the boring scenes, which, by the way lasted way to long.i would have rather spent that time watching ""Far and Away"" with both stars in that."
2,ok dvd,not as good as i thought it was. saw it years ago and thought it was good.Eyes Wide Shut (Unrated Two-Disc Special Edition)
2,DISSAPOINTED !,"WHEN I HEARD ABOUT A KUBRICK MOVIE WITH KIDMAN, CRUISE & POLLACK I WAS EXCITED ! ALL THE GOOD INGREDIENTS WERE THERE TO MAKE AN EXCELLENT MOVIE ; BUT I WAS SO DISSAPOINTED... THE STORY IS JUST PLAIN & CONFUSING ; KIDMAN IS VERY GOOD BUT CRUISE GAVE A POUR INTERPRETATION. THE ONLY VERY THING ARE THE SETS WHICH ARE VERY ARTISTICS..."
2,No plot,"The movie had no plot and story line.I mean yes it was about real life, but it is a sleeper.I wouldn't waste my time on this movie."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzz,"Although the direction was interesting, the story line and acting were so slow, I could have gone out for a coffee and danish and not missed a thing. The last scene was thought provoking, but I'm sorry I sat through the whole thing to get to it."
2,Huh?,"A very long time to wait for a punchline that Kidman is incapable of delivering. Cruise is a non-starter and it's time for the guy to have some work done on his nose -- sounds like he's breathing through a straw. The only part of the movie that works is the 'big house' section: good music, nudity until it starts to seem like furniture. What was Kubrick thinking? Anyone but the Kidman brothers! Very disappointing last effort."
1,So boring.....,"There just 3 words: TOO MUCH BORING. Perhaps, I was waiting other film. I did not like it. The dialogues were extremely long."
1,Utter...,"Let me first state that I highly enjoy movies with an intellectual stimulus and that actually make you think beyond the roll of the credits.This is not what this movie is.What it is, is garbage. There's no intellectual quest, emotional investment, or discovery of character. It's an excuse to produce a film of nothing but people walking around naked in highly-unbelievable sadomasochitic bliss. If this version is Kubrick's actual intent, then shame on him. Tom Cruise is at his worst. There's nothing enjoyable or even redeemable about his character. He's just trite and boring. Kidman fares somewhat better, given the material. Ironic that after their divorce, her movies get better (bordering on brilliance) and his get worse.""The difference between pornography and erotica is lighting,"" said Gloria Leonard. This movie is neither. It's lining for the litter box."
3,This would have been a ten star film,"were it not for the presence of Tom Cruise. Cruise is not the right actor for the character of Bill Hartford, you can't picture Cruise being seized by the kind of sexual and existential doubts that Hartford fallls into when he finds out that his wife has had sexual fanttasies that don't involve him and the sensual enticements he finds himself tempted to realize. Perhaps John Cusack or someone else in Cruise's age range could have done better with Kidman."
1,What Was All The Hoopla About?,"I had heard that Eyes Wide Shut wasn't any good, but I went ahead and rented it to see what all the ""talk"" was about. What a terrible dissapointment! This movie was like a soft core porno flick. The only plot this movie had was sex. Cruise and Kidman didn't do too good a job acting either. Eyes Wide Shut was a bad movie from the get go. I would advise not renting it."
1,Don't Waste Your Time . . . .,"It's a good thing Kubrick isn't around anymore to waste celluloid like this. What's up with this guy? Does he have to be so artsy-fartsy as to think you don't have to have a plot, you can get away with obvious or misleading red-herrings and you can introduce characters willy-nilly without using them later or have a reason in the first place for having them there? Tom and Nicole did a fabulous job acting to a sub-standard script. Both quality actors, I felt embarrased for them that they fell for this dog. It seemed as if Kubrick wanted to make a porn movie but didn't have the guts."
1,HUH??PLEASE HELP!!...,"OK, maybe because i am 18 is the reason why i dont understand the movie. But, i have watched this movie at least 4 times i STILL DONT GET IT.. please someone explain the plot and the whole point of the movie because all it looks like to me is a movie with alot of naked girls in it.....Why is it that at the end of the movie Nicole Kidman told Tom Cruise that they had one more thing to do ..."
2,Stanley... what kind of movie were you thinking you made?,Not a great Stanley Kubrick film but not one of the worst films I have ever saw... Surprised at the caliber of film stars who were in it... As expensive and the long production time as it took to make this film... it should have been far better...
2,Not their best...,"This movie just wasn't for me...I did not finish watching it. I cannot criticize the movie, it was just something that I could not enjoy."
3,Kidman is an academy award winning actress,Amazon needs to update its description of this movie. Kidman is not just a golden globe winner. she is an academy award winner.
1,Don't buy this DVD.,"What can I say? The beginning of the movie went just fine and started to build questions and expectations as to how everything was going to resolve at the end. Tom Cruise gets involved in a very complex situation that would probably require some creative solution.And what happened at the end? The end of the movie really sucks. They do nothing at the end. All the interest that you have build during the movie brings you frustration at the end.Maybe Stanley Kubrick didn't get a chance to finish the movie himself and someone else got to do the end of the movie. If this was the case, then it makes sense why end of the movie stinks.My suggestion: Don't buy this DVD. If you are really curious just rent it and you'll see what I'm talking about.PS: I don't know if I should dump this DVD in the trash."
4,about this movie Eyes Wide shut.....,contains a cult scene inside and without erotic scene only....:-)
1,Eyes Wide Shut,"I mistakenly got a Blu-Ray version of this movie and have not been able to get it replaced yet. As one of thoseolder, unknowing Grandmas I had no idea that the Blu-Ray thing made a difference (still not entirely clear about the difference). Hopefully, I can get a replacement sincethis was one my daughter especially wanted."
1,Don't Waste your precious time!,"An agonizingly slow, slow movie that goes nowhere. What a terrible disappointment. Anything would be better than 3 hours of a plot that went nowhere."
1,Take this movie...please!,"Boring, agonizingly slow, annoying repetitions of dialogue, and the sex scenes are enough to make one strongly consider celibacy. Also, rather unrealistic-- a doctor with a fabulous condo overlooking Central Park West, a Range Rover, extensive art collection, and high end office and he only has 2 patients scheduled in an afternoon? Must be some kind of expensive house calls he makes. See this movie if you enjoy having a root canal."
1,Open and shut,"An overrated movie from an overpraised director. Still, it's sad that the man behind Dr. Strangelove finished his life and career on this low note. What is the point of this movie? Is Kubrick exploring the psycho-social ramifications of orgiastic sex? Is it a statement on the subterranean mores of cosmopolitan wives? Is it a warning that a dangerous cabal controls the sexual topography? Is Kubrick enjoying a private joke at the expense of Tom and Nicole's acting abilities? Even the film's ardent admirers can't say. But why should we fault them? Kubrick himself seemed confused. If you are someone who likes to see some examination of virtue (as well as decent acting) in a drama, you will find very little of value in Eyes Wide Shut."
1,Big letdown,Being a lover of the majority of Kubrick's previous outings I was extremely dissapointed by this. The plot and pace would have made a snail embarassed and as for the camera work...are lens glare and reflections supposed to enhance the movie in some way I don't understand? Call me a charlatan but I disliked this movie intensely
1,Eyes should have stayed shut,"How very sad that the great master Kubrick should have this awful mess as his final offering to the world. Cruise is impossibly unbelieveable and Kidman shows her ""talents"" as it were several times. The score is also pitiful. One of the worst films I have ever seen. Definitely a rental."
2,Not so shocking,"When I saw this movie in the theater, I had high hopes for it. From the reviews I heard, it was supposed to shock me. But, sadly, it didn't. This story could have easily been told in an hour 1/2. If you want to be shocked, you're better off renting/buying Basic Instinct, Fatal Attraction, or 9 1/2 weeks... Rent it first then buy it if you like it."
1,The worst Kubrick film ever! No the worst film ever!,This is one of the worst films I have ever seen! With no emphasis on plot or characterisation whatsoever! Cruise prefers to reveal his character's emotional turmoil through twitching and Kidman is useless in her too brief role in the film! There is but one word to say for Kubrick's final piece- dire!
2,Did you actually fall for this?,"Eyes closed. This is a wierd movie. The sexuality in it is not sexy, it is wierd. The ending is utterly unsatisfactory. I'm not a Stanley Kubrick fan. I think he is pretty bad. The actors talk too slow. It's all part of the pseudo wierdness that is going on in this inferior movie. They built us a complicated structure, and I'm standing on the sidelines pointing out that the emperor has no clothes on, and his underwear is funny looking. And what is that stupid ending anyway? And does the Tom Cruise character have a mind? Or is he a suit of clothes with a balloon inside, being led around by the nose by every other character in the movie? Would it be too much to ask to have Nicole Kidman's character have her head screwed on straight instead of being whatever the hell she is here? This flick was made in Jonathan Swift's Laputa, land in the sky. Hey - let's get down to earth a little. A little reality please, in the characters, their reactions, something?"
1,Drink plenty of coffee before watching this one.,Words cannot describe how BAD this film is. The scenes are so long and drawn out that you want to run screaming from the room. It will take more than a little nudity to make this film vaguely interesting. Save your money!
1,"Horrible, disgusting feature","I hated this movie. So did all my family. Pure crap. Trust me, stay away from this one."
1,The Cool Movie That Couldn't,"This movie had an thought provoking premise. Imagine you find out your loving wife and mother of your daughter admits her lust for another man. Not only that she also tells you she would have left you for a chance at that man. This film takes into one mans quest at finding absolution for his mind. Sounds like an interesting story right? Wrong! The movie spends unimaginable amounts of time with conversations that should have took seconds. There was a noble attempt to give you those meaningful pauses for dramatic effect. Unfortunately there were to many. As far as skin, there is plenty but most(excluding the orgy) takes place in the first half hour to try to get the average horndog hooked. The MPAA made them alter the only scenes that could have saved this film. The only way I would buy this DVD is if the International version was released. Rent it don't buy."
1,EYES WIDE BORED,"Watching this movie was like a bad dream. Nicole Kidman acted and talked like she had been sniffing glue, and Tom Cruise was a bad fit in his doctor role.I kept telling myself something is going to happen, it's gonna pick up. Never did. Skip it."
3,Average yet one of my favorites...,"I find this movie very average. The acting is uninspiring and the plot is pathetic to say the least. It has the potential to be interesting, but it takes so many useless loops that in the end you don't care about the plot at all.What makes me call this movie one of my favorites, besides the scenes of a half-nude Nicole Kidman and the steamy orgy scene, is how edgy this film is. It has a semi-porn movie feel to it, yet you know that you are watching A-list actors like Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. The movie is raw and edgy and very appealing. If you want to buy this movie for a great viewing experience, simply pass on it. However, if you would like to watch something original and edgy for once, then this movie would be a great addition to your collection."
2,ATTN STUDIOS: YOU ARE LOSING MONEY WITH PAN AND SCAN!!!,"Who, I'd like to know, is the genius at the studio (Warner Bros?) who has decided to release many great movies in the dreaded pan and scan format on DVD? I own most of the Kubrick movies already on VHS and I waited sooo long to upgrade to DVD but what's the point. I'm not sure what Mr. Kubrick's intentions were but perhaps if he had seen all that DVD could provide not just the casual movie watcher but also the movie buff-- he most likely would have given people the option of deciding for themselves which format they would like to see. Many people feel as I do-- you would sell so much more. Incidently-- BONNIE and CLYDE was released in the pan and scan format then someone got wise and released it letterboxed-- I bought it immediately!!I GIVE EYES WIDE SHUT in its theatrical release formatting the FULL FIVE STARS. The DVD in its current form only gets a 2."
4,Very good almost excellent,"Very good movie, shows two great stars together in a great script. Don't miss it."
5,"A great collaboration from Kubrick, Cruise and Kidman!","Almost all of Stanley Kubrick's movies are masterpieces and this is no exception. The most misunderstood movie of 1999 is actually quite good. As with all of Kubrick's films you can sense the 'perfectionism', Kidman and Cruise took big career risks with this film and I think it paid off. As usual with Kubrick; great cinematography, lighting, score and atmosphere. Great performances by almost all the cast, a little mis-casting may have hurt the film a bit. The film possesses a provocative subject matter that raises questions that are mostly left unanswered, but maybe it's better that way. Great for Kubrick fans, if you can not appreciate this film than you didn't really understand Kubrick. A worthy final chapter in the life of a genious. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!"
4,nwo,"if i remember correctly, this film had to do with mental erasure for the sake of profit.This rebounds on the main character and he has to reveal the betrayal of his friends."
2,Damaged case.,"The case was a little damaged, which for a movie collector was a little frustrating. However the DVD worked flawlessly and functionally everything was perfect."
2,incredibly slow,takes forever to get off the ground. overacted throughout and generally overwrought and tiresome. No wonder Tom and Nicole ended up divorced.
4,Watch the mirrors,"I see little need to convince the naysayers, but for those willing to give the time and concentration - the remarkable thing about Eyes Wide Shut is the astonishing parallels with another of Kubrick's works: The Shining. These two films have a strange, almost uncanny thematic kinship. The plot structures are also, yes, very similar - the male protagonists in both films rebel against their familial bonds and find themselves in the grip of more seductive - and dangerous - forces. Most enigmatic, the menace of Kubrick's ghostly elites at the Outlook and his masked elites at the orgy - a surreal, spectral treatment of class arrogance that binds these two films like distorted mirror images of one another -(incidentally, watch the way Kubrick uses mirrors in each film.) Kubrick has left us a wonderful puzzle. It is worth pursuing."
4,"I ordered a pair of large, but i need medium..","I bought a pair of large and when i got them they where to big.. Grr i actually need a pair of mediums, i guess i will go down to the autpparts store here in town and get the right size i need there..."
4,Great all around glove,"I bought this glove for tactical use.The thumb and fingertip reinforcements are durable yet supple enough to allow leader tasks like writing, paper sorting, and radio function.The wrist length cut works well with long sleeves.The micro hook and fastener used to close the glove functions really well under normal conditions but is susceptible to clogging when exposed to dirt and mud. A simple rinse restores closing function.The gloves are not rated as fire resistant and the palm material is not quick dry.These gloves are not waterproof or insulated.I have no problems with trigger feel or performing remedial action while wearing these gloves.I recommend these gloves for all around wear and function. I've been using this glove for a year without so much as a busted stitch or hole in the gloves. The value for the price is obvious when comparing these gloves to other tactical gloves priced many times more expensive."
5,Worth the high price,"I was skeptical about mechanix gloves, just couldn't see myself paying 25-30$ for gloves that usually last me a week or two. I work on steel doors and frames. Install is hell on your hands, and gloves. Dealing with sharp steel edges and holding screws normally tears new gloves within a day or two. I would just get the cheap 9$ HD brand ones. I decided to splurge this last November, and I'm glad i did. These are my new favorites. I have worked with a few other designs of mechanix but the mpact outlast them all. 1 pair will last me a month. For this design, be sure to order the size you would normally order,NOT a size smaller for a tight fit."
4,Mi tercer par,"Cuando compre el primero me pareciaron buenos, el segundo, tambien, pero en ambos casos lo primero que fallo fue el dedo indice, pues solo era la tela lo que cubria, lo mande a reparar. En este tercer me complace decir que ya cuenta con proteción para darle màs duración. No necesitas ser mecanico para tenerlos, cuando te acostumbres a usarlos los usaras casi para todo...Se pueden lavar en la lavadora...Mi esposa tiene los suyos y le encantan pues no se maltratan sus manos...los usa poco he de decir"
3,Found it at Walmart and cheaper,"After I paid for the product (including S&H) I found it at Walmart and cheaper. don't get me wrong; it is a good glove. my husband loves it, but i wished I knew this before paying for S&H."
4,excellent work gloves,"really like these gloves, very sharp looking, lots of useful features and a good fit! can do lots of tasks with them on that i would normally take a glove off to do! my only complaint is they offer very little warmth at all!"
5,m-pacted review,"these mechanix gloves are the best that i have bought and i have about 5 pair, i like to be prepared. even though the emphasis is the ""m-pact"" on the back of the hand the palm has the perfect amount of thickness as well. they fit great and work well."
2,"Average for impact, cammo fabric non resistant to glove velcro","I purchased this attracted by the ""impact protection"" thinking in paintball game, so this gloves are great keeping your fingers dry, not good for detail task, the fabric (camo part) will be destroyed by the original velcro of the glove if ever in contact(first use I sadly discover this) , and the protection is like 4mm high so they would not help much to ease direct impact of a paintball (talking about real impact). It has good looks, thats it, too high price for little impact protection & looks together, about sizing, I followed the instructions of their page to choose and get the ""long fingers"" problem. Go for Sup Grip is the Real deal for impact protectionSup Grip Armor Paintball Gloves (Regular - Black) Large - paintball gloves"
3,"Nice glove, big in the wrist, hook/loop closure separating","Purchased for mountain biking due to the great reviews on mtbr. Maybe I have skinny wrists, but there is just a little bit more room than I would like to make the glove feel secure. Rest of the fit is great. After less than two months of riding 4-6 times a week, the hook and loop on one glove is starting to separate. A bit disappointing as I usually wear holes in the palms of a glove before low stress areas like the closures begin to fail. Maybe I just got a bad pair. I do put them to work so will purchase one more pair before forming my final opinion and putting them on the NG list."
3,MMP Should be MVP,Great glove for Mechanics reduces the impact from the use of air tools. I love the color. Not good for turning wrenches made strictly for use with air tools. Long time wear causes restriction of blood flow the next size up is too large.
3,"Mechanix Wear MMP-72-008 M-Pact Glove, Coyote, Small","PROs:- Great overall protection for my hands during Airsoft games- Good Design- Awesome padded protections in critical areasCONs:- The color is in khaki and NOT Cayote Brown as advertise!!- Quality of the velcro is not MIL-SPEC in my opinion, doesn't provide a very secure lock.- The same size (8) ""Mechanix Original Glove"" fits my hands much better compare to this one."
2,"Great fit, poor quality","I had great usage of Mechanix gloves before, so I was looking forward to this new type; unfortunately, in less than 2 weeks of very light usage (carrying items and such) the plastic overlay is already coming off. I would not recommend this item to anyone who wants to use this gloves seriously."
5,i used it for scuba diving....,"i bought another for my extra...so happy with it, i used it for scuba diving here in our tropical country....it does the job.... it also fits well and it is pretty tough. im sure it will go a very long way with me."
5,I just couldn't put it down!!,I am not a big book reader by any means...as a matter of fact I don't think I have ever read a book front to back!! I was handed this book and was just wondering what it was about. The first chapter..then the next..then the next...well before I knew it I was done with the book..I couldn't put it down!! I found that there was so much that I could relate to in every day life and it just encouraged me to keep going.A truly honest and personal book!
4,Praise to the Idiots Guide,"Being a self proclaimed historian I figured that this book would be similar to reading an elementary school text. I was very suprised! The way the text is written keeps even knowledgeable historians engrossed. Instead of the typical ""eloquent"" texts filled with English ""fluff"" this book gets to the point and tells you what is important. The only thing that was a little uncomfortable was having it on my coffee table (the title makes people wonder about you!). A great read."
3,"Packed with information, lacking fascination","The line of ""Idiot's"" books seems to be aimed for the everyday reader. Unfortunately, this volume falls just short of drawing you in. Peppered with little known facts and anecdotes separated from the text by boxes, Axelrod fills this history book with information. Although this is less intimidating than most history tomes, this idiot wasn't able to read her way through, but found it useful for looking up facts in the index."
5,Sony Cybershot DSC-T50,"Awesome, compact camera that takes remarkably sharp pics- very easy to use touchscreen and (my favorite)reliable stabilization feature."
3,"Outdoor Pics = A+, Pics w/ Flash = D at best","I've had this camera for 2 years now and I absolutely love the touch screen interface. That was the main reason why I chose this camera. It takes excellent pictures outdoors. All my friends compliment the quality. However, when you take pictures at night with flash, almost every single picture has red eye even when the red eye reduction feature is on. Additionally, many pictures have white spots on them when the flash is on. I'm very disappointed that it isn't a good all around camera but I'm happy with the quality it takes outdoors.I do not recommend this camera unless you intend on taking the majority of your pictures outdoors."
2,No good,"Good design, very compact. Image quality outside in day light is ok. Thats pretty much it..........indoor this camera is almost unusable. 3x is not enough and wide angle lens is a must. Pretty much all T-Series are beginner/kids cameras"
4,"Very good, but...","The Camera has fullfilled mostly all the expectations. Only the anti blur system(super steady shot)was quite disapointing because most moving objects apears as blury as at my other, and oldest, Olympus digital camera. I really expected more from it."
1,No Docking Station even at this price???,"This is another example of how Sony is alienating its customer base. Not only will it not work with standard SD memory like everyone else, it does not include a docking station. You have to shell out more money for that option. I dont think so!"
3,AMAZON says that this DVD is in ENGLISH but it's not,"Having purchased the first two excellent Eastern Star GALAXY EXPRESS dubbed DVDs, I was really looking forward to this one. When I received it from AMAZON, however, it turned out to be in Japanese with no dub so I had to return it as my kids really don't watch non-English DVDs."
2,short life span,This will work for a while and the price is low. Good temporary item.If you have any plans of using it frequently or for more than a year get an all brass one. The plastic valve handle parts will break. Mine all have.
3,Just Okay,"Discovering the Waterfront was when I discovered this band. I loved them. I even enjoy most of When broken is easily fixed. However this is almost a complete change in sound. While it is not bad, it just doesnt seem to live up to Silverstein's potential. It just sounds not very well composed. Again, it isnt horrible, so it is still worth a listen, just dont expect anything better than Discovering the Waterfront."
3,Lacks heart..,"I was thrilled when I heard that Silverstein had released a new cd, seeing i liked much of their earlier material and ""Discovering the Waterfront"" is one of my all time favourite cd's.I've listened through the cd a few times.. I don't like the new guitar sound, it's alot more ""mainstream"" .. more similar to what bands like Yellowcard and etc use. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate anything just because it's ""mainstream"" .. but when you have something original going on i dont think its a good idea to abandon it.Also I think this cd lacks heart and the pure raw emotion Discovering the Waterfront had.. most of the songs just don't hit home for me.Standout tracks for me:If you could see into my soul (only song that reminds me of dtw)The sand will turn into glassVanity and GreedTrue Romance"
4,A rare punk rock gem,"This is the first two efforts, now out of print, by the band that formed out of the remains of the Subhumans in England. Culture shock carries the ska banner a bit further and has slightly more groove than the Subhumans did. Still, Go wild/All the time is loaded with plenty of the angst-addled, sing along choruses and the up tempo basslines that fans of this classic UK punk sound have come to know and love. I Have missed this record ever since my vinyl got thrashed back in the early 90's. Enjoy folks - Go wild!"
3,Not for gardening,"My 2 yr old loves this but you cannot use it in the garden. The tools are made of plastic, the gloves are for a larger child and the sunglasses broke the first time she wore them. If you really want to garden with your kids don't get this."
5,Bel Airs party,"Another great release of midwest swing blues from the Bel Airs. A very fine band that has been together for a long time creating a good tight groove. It's all about the sound, they have it. I hope that other areas of the world are becoming acquainted with this fine blues band. They are original and appear to copy no one. Great harmony, you'll like them."
5,Will not ruin your garden,"Wow, I can't believe all the harsh reviews of this album. I'm not a big Calexico fan by any stretch, but this was one of my favorite albums of 2006. It was one of those I had downloaded (legally) and kept listening to it so often that I bought a hard copy. Admittedly this does not sound anything like their previous work and it is a bit on the mellow country-rock tip, but anyone who likes say, Wilco, will have no trouble digging this."
2,slightly dull,"Its a shame when a band changes tact for the worse, but I cant help but give them credit for trying, what do you do when you've released 5 or 6 albums/ep's all along the same line and you start to get a touch bored with the style you've honed to perfection, you go in to the studio with a different producer and you experiment, this one ""I think"" fizzed and died soon after conception.you can only hope that the next one rises from the bland ashes of this release."
1,letdown,"I've played it many times and still can't recall a single tune. There just don't seem to be any memorable songs on it. A few nice moments, but mostly ""strum and mumble"" yawners."
2,"well crafted, bland pop music","This album shows the ability of Calexico to write an album full of beautiful, accessible pop songs. Most of their fans are probably not too interested in this talent, however. I think hanging out with Sam Beam has piqued their interest in crafting lyrically-driven tunes, but this album sadly leaves us fans with little of what we love about Calexico's soundscapes. I really wanted to like this album, but I find it boring and generic."
2,Scrap iron and Sour wine,"Gone is the evocative cinematic melancholy of their previous releases. Gone is the sound of a quiet sentence silenced in it's half, vanishing on the dusty horizon of the heart. Gone is their ability to make me say such things. Apparently motivated by their previous collaboration with Sam Beam yet lacking his actual vision what remains is your regular old sadness, like listening to a friend talk about some inconvenience that happened to them over coffee or on the cell phone. If you, like me, thought ""quattro"" represented a sort of pinnacle of the band's ability to express images and emotion through music and sound, you were right, as there's nothing like it here.In short, or rather shorter, they have managed to extract iron & wine's peculiar (and self-controversial) radio friendliness, leaving out what makes it self-controversial, it's artistic essence and vision."
3,Return to roots?,"Joey Burns grew up on the beach of Los Angeles California, so it's not surprising that some of the music he writes does not harken to the dusty desert border towns. That came later.This record actually sounds quite a bit like the music he was writing and playing in high school and college; To me, it brings back some memories of the old Palos Verdes days. It's kind of nice to hear Joey come back 'round to his old influences (r.e.m., etc..)So, Joey, how 'bout putting ""Purple Treehouse"" on your next album?"
4,I am enjoying this one,"I admit to being partial to the sound of Calexico's previous albums, and I would not have minded another one in the same vein. After a couple listens of Garden Ruin, however, I can say that this is a strong album and is laced with their former distinction. Recommended."
5,"more mystery than drama, but thoroughly enjoyable","David Zinman is constructing a Mahler cycle for the ages. His mastery is apparent in the second, where the passages breath, and every facet, from instrument sound to pacing to volume, is used to convey a musical story. Zinman lends an air of mystery to this work that I have not heard before; quite wondrous in places. Zinman's second is not dark and dangerous, as Mahler 2 is often portrayed, and so is a matter of taste as to interpretation. But the quality of sound and clarity is unsurpassed, as is the enjoyment of sheer musicality. Mahler's sophistication shines through under Zinman's baton.My other favorite Mahler 2s include Claudio Abbado (Chicago) and Bruno Walter (the benchmark); and when in the mood for more melodrama: Simon Rattle (Birmingham) and, naturally, Leonard Bernstein (New York / DG)."
3,A Guy's viewpoint,"It's not a bad book. The mathamatical formulas can be fun, and surprisingly interesting at how things get factored. This book looks like the kind of thing women could have fun working through at a ""Live Nude Girls""-esq type slumber party. Though the unmarried women may swear off looking after working through all the formulas. The revolting vagina test is probably the most important one. The suggestion for curing the Madonna-Whore complex was interestingly-simply get your man to spank you. Thus you swap roles. I did find it all too true about how to evaluate your man's porn collection & choice of prostitutes. Time & again I see the happily married guys on business trips select lap dancers & such that look like their wives. The non-happily married ones select women who look different, just like the book says."
4,The Soong Sisters,The Soong Sisters have an interesring background. They all appeared to marry well and were influential in their time.
3,Your general street guide,"I recommend buying this if you are moving to Pittsburgh. It's your basic street guide and a must have if you will be driving around. Pittsburgh is an interesting city to drive in and it's easy to potentially get lost. This city does not seem to have been built with a grid in mind, similar to Los Angeles but definitely different. I also found a missing street name on one of the pages and I just hope it was the only one."
5,Do not vote until you read his book!,"To the average Republican, this may read as a conspiracy theory book, but it's NOT. The author has thouroughly researched this book, and the result is a dubious description of the unconscionable activities of the Bush administration. From the elections in Florida right through April 2004 it gives example after examples of the administration lying to Congress and the American public. Topics covered are the Iraq, the economy, the environment (not mentioned is a single debate, much to my dismay), the Patriot Act, the treatment of the military, education (No Child Left Behind Act), and healt care, among others. It is amazing to me (though after all the bald-faced lying, not so much) how this administration has managed to hookwink so many Americans. Don't let yourself be one of them."
1,"Great story, poor condition of a book","The quality of the condition of this book was the polar opposite of the quality of this story. Had I known about the two pages ripped in half and taped together and the many pages with rips that were not repaired, I would not have bought the used book. Yes, I would have purchased a new book as my 21 kindergarteners liked the story. They were upset about the torn pages."
5,Great Cookware,"Best cookware that I have seen and used so far. I have been using Revere for around five years now and haven't a problem with them. They get used atleast once a week and trust me, I am not easy on them. lol"
4,"Nice set, but.","One of the pans has a warp in the side, so the lid doesn't fit right. Other than that, it's a nice set."
3,Wanted More,"I will be honest in my oversight. I originally purchased this book thinking that it contained the writings of Thomas More not Thomas Moore. Still, I decided to give this book a chance.While I was hoping for a collection of spiritually beneficial writings, I was disappointed to find a collection of anecdotes from inside the wall of a monastery. Even further to my disappointment, these anecdotes are too brief and fail to tell a complete story. Even when Moore is trying to give a lesson in his story, his point is often a stretch.Some of the stories had a peculiarity about them that made them enjoyable. These stories were too scattered for me to recommend that somebody spend their money on this book. Thomas Merton has collections of spiritual writings that are far superior to this one."
3,Hard to judge,"This is a rather short book. It gave a few insights here and there. Perhaps I didn't understand it as deeply as I should have, but I finished reading this book feeling a bit empty handed. Perhaps I read through it too quickly. Apparently, the publishers must have seen something about it that they thought worthy. As a book loving, yet frugal consumer, I would recommend borrowing this book from the library, if possible. Then, if you think it worthy of your possession, then you can buy it later."
1,Poor to deal with,The parts did not fit right. When I wanted to return them I did as I was asked to. I went online and filled out the form and submitted it. They never got back to me. I asked Amazon to contact them which they did. And still they didn't get to me.Very poor way to do business. I would caution anyone do business with this outfitDavid
2,I don't get it.,"Pico Iyer apparently has something of a cult following, and well, I guess his writing is an acquired taste. He's introspective, and on a first name basis with his old family friend, the Dalai Lama, and hangs out in the mountains above Los Angeles with Leonard Cohen and his Buddhist guru, but for all its potential, none of this was very interesting to me. Jet lag is a theme visited throughout the essays, and reading this book made me feel like I was suffering from it myself.You don't learn much about the places described (that is, when Iyer actually writes about a place), but you learn about what's going on inside Iyer's head, and frankly, I just didn't get it."
1,Poor quality DVD,"Perhaps the greatest TV series of all time. This season was the only one where the DVD quality was poor, hence the 1 star rating. Unless you want the whole series, I suggest you don't bother with season 1."
5,All In The Family - A Groundbreaker,"I love the All In The Family episodes. I enjoyed all of these shows on the first run starting in the 70's. The show explored a lot of subjects that were pretty much ""taboo"" when I was growing up. People only hear about Archie and his bigotry. I don't think that many people really sit down and watch the shows and realize that Archie was a product of the times. All that he learned was basically learned at home. Carroll O'Connor was a comic genius and he ""made"" Archie be the success that he was.I purchased Season Five to add to the first four seasons. My complaints are that after Season Two - the DVD's no longer have spanish subtitles. The other complaint is that it takes a long time for each season to be put out for purchase."
3,"Show is great, packaged poorly",Packaged poorly. An obvious 5 stars for the show. 3 star rating is for them cramming all three dvd's on top of one another on one spool. Resulting in dvd's easily being scratched.
5,All in the Family Fifth Season,"Another amazing addition to my collection. Archie, Edith, Mike and Gloria amaze me each time I watch this . Amazing memories of times long gone.One of my favorites."
4,Really Good,For the person who asked about how many episodes you geton All In The Family Season 5. I think It's 24 shows.Hope It Helps!!Jeff Zerban.
3,Good novel for a rainy day,"Roarke's Folly by Claire Delacroix is a good novel for a rainy day, just to get away from reality for a while. The story is about a knight, Roarke d'Aalgen, who bargains for his family's pride (unbeknownst to his family); he accepts a position with a cloth-maker to work off the debt, but is surprised when the owner's daughter ends up being the very maiden he tried (and failed) to seduce. Beautiful, innocent Adela catches Roarke off guard, and they find themselves growing very enamored of each other. Not a whole lot of action, but a nice get-away."
2,This could have been amazing.,"Normally I don't write reviews, but I'm writing this in hopes that the authors/publishers will read this. I bought this book as a textbook for an Anthropology class discussing globalization and change. While there is a lot of good information found in the text, the presentation is abhorrent. Most of the chapters read like research or book proposals; instead of simply presenting the information (which there is plenty of!) the authors also provided a lot of information that was not important to the context of the book. If the information were presented in a more coherent manner it would be a better read and more cohesive. This disjointed effort is a good attempt, but falls short of leaving a meaningful impact because of such a poor presentation."
3,Reality Check,"Ok, Chris and Jen's close pals or stalker-types have written long-winded sword-swallowing reviews of this album but it's time for the truth. The album is not very good. I gave it 3 stars on artistic merit alone and the fact that Chris Gunst is a terrific person (I know nothing of Jen but I'm sure she's wonderful). Not a single song will slay you in the way B-Sparks songs like ""Canyon Ride"" or ""Let it Run"" may. In fact, you don't even get a song as good as Strictly Ballroom's ""A Picture"". I am sure some will say I am nude and don't ""get it"" but except for a few tunes here (Sure, Bert being the best) this is a serious disappointment for me. Then again, I doubt they had me in mind during these sessions."
4,Next World,"Big BoA fan...her engrish is horrible, but it's fun to see the progression of her career."
5,yes but.. 42 fricken dollars?,for this cdit has about 13 songsthe cd on here available is used and they put it up for 42 dollarsits not worht that much!its worth your money but i need a reasonable price
4,Emotional,"I don't normally read novels based on history from World War II. It is so very emotional and challenging for me. However, I did feel this was warranted and very motivating. I'll make another time to read this as well."
3,It helps to keep an open mind,"My initial review of this book was less than favorable, due mostly to the introspective nature of the work. It was my feeling when I initially wrote my review that this served to detract from the larger issues with which Jehovah's witnesses are well versed.Upon further reflection, due in great part to an e-mail discussion with a friend, I have reevaluated my position regarding this. Yes, this book is very introspective, and this certainly does not appeal to my more analytic taste. However, ""wisdom is proved righteous by its works"", and I can not disregard the collective good that has been accomplished by the telling of Simone Liebster's very personal story.So, my apologies to anyone offended by my previous review. And if my review negatively influenced a buying decision on your part, I sincerely hope that you will reconsider your decision."
5,Simone is a real survivor,"This book is a first hand account of a young girl who had what it took to survive her horrible experience under the Nazi's. What she ""had"" was her religion. It is amazing to me that the large amount of Jehovah's Witnesses came through those war years able to cope with life after the war. So many others (in the camps) had no means of doing so. What J.W.'s have is nothing short of a miracle, as I have seen for myself. My 18 yr. old son and I met Simone and her husband at their home in France this past winter. The first thing Max did was to show us the number tattooed on his arm.Then he said to my son, ""young man, I watched a 1000 people being put to death every day"". Yet, here he stood, just out of the hospital the day before, still bright and full of life and love for his faith, at over 90 yrs. old. Next on my list is his book which I hear is just as inspiring as his wife's."
3,Mislabeled?,"this is listed as a gel pen. though i received my order quickly (2 days), this is a ballpoint pen, not gel, and as i prefer gel pens, i am terribly disappointed."
5,Nice Aerial View of Idaho,Good video -- I never knew that Idaho had so many different looking regions. I am looking forward to flying over much of it in my light plane.
4,Good book to use as part of your CNA study aids.,"I used this book and Foundations of Novell Networking: Netware 6.5 to pass the test. This book alone might not be enough, especially if you don't have hands on experience with managing Netware server. I thought this book did not have enough exercises to pass the test. It is still an excellent source to use as part of your exam preparation."
4,What we have lost,This is a very charming book. Captures a slice of life that is long gone but defined the present-- made Miami and the Grove into the special places they still are-- but in glimmers of what once was. Now these places are choked with traffic and condos. But this book allows you to go back to what once was.
2,Great idea but scratches too easily,"I really like the spout and the soft grip handle, but inside of my bowl is all scratched. I'm now looking for either stainless steal, glass, or stoneware."
1,Nice design Poof Functionality,"I bought this mouse while on the road when I forgot my Microsoft wireless mouse. I do not have the original packaging otherwise I would have taken in back. The USB receiver is hard to get out of its cradle in the back, I often have to pry it out with a coin or a credit card. After a week of use the mouse started to wig-out. Erratic movement etc. If the mouse is left unattended for any length of time I cannot seem to wake it up with any of the buttons. The ONLY thing that works is using the wheel to scroll. The really bad part is that it seems to behave this way until I unplug the receiver. I thought this was because I was using a Mac, I experienced the same behavior on my PC as well. I'm going to throw this away since I would not wish it on my enemy!"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I WISH I WOULD HAVE READ THE EARLIER REVIEWS ON THIS MOUSE. HAD I DONE SO, I WOULDN'T HAVE PURCHASED THIS ONE. NO SENCE IN KICKING A DEAD HORSE BUT I CONCUR WITH ANY AND ALL OF THE PREVIOUS COMPLAINTS. FRUSTRATION IS THE WORD"
1,Horrible use of battery power - PURCHASE NOT RECOMMENDED,"This would be a great wireless mouse if it weren't for it's battery usage. It runs on dual AAA batteries. They need replacing about every 2-3 weeks. I DO NOT recommend this mouse. Instead of adding to my large collection of AAA batteries, I'm purchasing another mouse that handles battery usage efficiently."
4,3 Cheers for Archie & Olivia,"This book rates 4 stars because Archie and Olivia are such good parents. But the book focuses more on Archie and Peyton than on Cooper and Eli. Inexplicably, the book has neither a table of context nor an index."
5,Definitely worth the read!,"What a great insight to the lives of a close-knit family, who never let fame or fortune change who they are! Excellent book!"
5,great product,this is one of the best products i have ever come across for real time picture ditortion
2,Awfully cute,"...matched by not very good sound. I wish I liked this better, but the sound is bad enough that I'm shopping as we speak for a replacement.Just to say something nice, it uses batteries sparingly."
4,Fine Shower Radio,Works fine and looks great in a beach home. The fin holder is a little difficult to hang up though.
4,It does the job.,"My only beef I have is that I ordered the blue fish and got the green and yellow one. Otherwise, I can't complain. The music comes in clearly and the batteries last for quite awhile. It's not fancy, but if all you're looking for is a shower radio, this is a good choice. Who wouldn't want a fish radio???"
2,Nice Design - Poor Reception,"I bought this a few years back and it was pretty well designed and actually pretty decent volume, though the speaker would distort with volume all the way up. The reason I didn't use it much is cause even in NJ with 30+ stations I could only tune 2 and they were ones I didn't want.Probably OK for a bath with a window on the outer side of a house, but my master bath was in the center of the house leaving me very poor reception."
2,"Old, almost used up.","The product itself is a fine product, when new. They have a limited life before the glow fades and goes away completely. These are all from 2004, meaning they only have a couple of years left in them. Pay a little more and get yourself a new pair from Kimber."
3,"Got white dot sights,thought I was getting green!","These white sights are better than the black iron sights, can't understand why Kimber put's black iron sights on their firearms for the price you pay for them!"
3,I have taken this product for many years and am glad that I can get it through this avenue.,"This has been a vitamin that I have consumed for years at the direction of a doctor. It has worked well for me. Thank you, Mozelle"
5,Z-BEC order,"My Z-BEC order was taken and processed perfectly, as usual. This seems to be a very beneficial vitamin supplement for me at my age, and it helps greatly being able to order and receive it as conveniently and as economically as I do thru Amazon.com."
5,Monster Cable,"huge guage, no kinks, and bullet proof, as expected. careful, though -- the picture shows an elbow connector but this listing is for a straight cable."
3,Half price elsewhere,"After buying one of these, I found them at half the price at another reputable seller. They work precisely as indicated. Stopped interference from my flat screen television and laptop power supply that were causing a real problem. Suggest you look elsewhere for a lower price."
4,Simple little winner,"This is a simple, straightforward travel clock. Thin and light. Easy to set the clock and alarm. The alarm on-off switch could be a little easier to find and use."
1,samsonite travel clock,"disappointed that the clock face does not show in the dark -- it was supposed to by the description of the item. I do like that it's analog, though."
1,Double Ugh.,"Call Joplin? You get the name of every person on the System except customer service. Why customer service? First GOG fell victim to one of the notorious Florida hurricanes: a big tree -- very big -- crushed it like a beer can. Second one -- the one with the seventy-five year warranty? Well hell, pilgrim, only 72 to go and it's self-destructing before my very eyes. Every cooking part including the ""Cast Brass"" burner is corroding such that the venturis no longer make contact with the burner, (an inch of tube has gone by way of rust; flames shot out and singed me eyebrows). Ah, but there is hope. The cabinet, top, and rollers are still good -- now if only I can buy a burner, venturis, an igniter, and drip pans, why hell, it'll be perfect.And the retailer? who sold it to me: told me to contact the manufacturer online. What the hell did we do before internet. We got to talk to someone but then what fun would that be. I think I'll go out for a hamburger."
5,Great Grill!,"I bought this for my husband as a birthday gift about 3 years ago, and he loves it! He did a lot of research on grills and found that this one had a great reputation and it has definatley lived up to all of our expectations. He now has become a Bar-B-Que grill snob. And my Dad liked it so much he went out and got him one too."
3,Return Of The Outlaws,"I've never seen the film, hence the 50/50 rating, but I have seen the clip from it featuring the Outlaws with Ritchie Blackmore, circa 1963. Buy it just for that."
4,Great book for earthquakes!,"When I was 12, My classroom needed a project of a volcano. And I went to the library in my school and found this book. I read it, And I was very sucessful in my science class!!! Buy this!! You'll learn about earthquakes/volcanoes. I highly recommend this for earth science classrooms."
4,Kind of creepy,But for some reason I just couldn't hate the guy in the movie. If the girl would have been a little more convincing actress I would 5 star it.
2,Flat and Dated.,"I commend Kubrick for first bring Nabokov's novel to the screen. However, I have to recommend director Adrian Lyne's version, with Jeremy Irons, Melanie Griffith, and the controversial debut of Dominique Swain as Lolita, over Kubrick's. This version reminds me of a Leave it to Beaver episode, no pun intended. For me, it had neither the poetic passion of Nabokov's novel or the sense of nervous guilt that Jeremy Iron's so perfectly displays in Lyne's version. Irons was perfect for the part of Humbert Humbert, you get the sense that he was obsessed by a true love for Lo. Humbert Humbert may be an anti-hero of sorts, but many people misinterpret the theme of Nabokov's novel and I can't really say that Kubrick's version did it any justice. I found it flat and dated. Nevertheless, it is worth a watch. However, I think true conesuers of Nabokov's work will find Lyne's version to be no less faithful and far more empathetic to Nabokov's vision."
2,"A great movie, but it won't play","Lolita (Amazon Exclusive) [Blu-ray] In my opinion, the original Lolita is one of the best movies ever made. The problem with this Blu-Ray version is that it hangs up in the opening menu and won't play. I've tried it on three machines and it hangs up in the same place on all three. It's a shame.Robert Groden"
1,"If you own DVD, don't bother.","Not up to Warner's usual high standard of Bluray transfer. No real difference from standard DVD. New transfer supposedly available next year. Wish I had known, would have waited."
1,Warner Brothers Gives Capitalism a Bad Name,"What a sleazy tactic: WB reissues the same lame DVD version of this magnificent film the same day that they release the Kubrick special edition box set. Yes...I know...there was nothing in the description of this DVD to mislead people into thinking that this was also a special edition. I remember thinking that when I preordered it. But I figured if WB is going through the trouble of reissuing Lolita on the same day as the special edition box set, then the DVD must be improved in some way (anamorphic, extras, SOMETHING!). But alas...I was duped into buying what I already had. Shame on me for giving WB the benefit of the doubt."
3,Sue Lyon Was Not Too Old to Play Lolita,"Sue Lyon was 14 when this film was made. Albeit Lolita is 12 in the book, but I don't think 14 is too much older. Some people seem to think she was 16 when the movie was made. I think that's because she was 16 when the movie premiered in America, but it was made when she was 14.That being said, I don't really care for the movie primarily because they're all such ugly characters. At least for the first half hour or so Shelly Winters makes things interesting, but once it's reduced to Lolita and Humbert riding around the country, it becomes so meandering it's really hard to care what becomes of them. It's not just because their characters are so unlikeable, but also because there's never an end to the road insight."
3,Nobakov: Lolita,"I got this because I remembered it from when it came out. It isn't as good as the original novel, partly because what is now viewed as child abuse is toned down, e.g. in the novel Lolita is about 12 years old, but in the film she's played by a post-pubescent 16 year old. And then there's the problem that the film fails to capture Nabokov's genius..."
2,Who is the manipulative one here?,"I haven't read the book, yet, but I always thought Lolita was the manipulative one. Her stepfather seems the be one forcing the issue -- manipulative, creepy, obsessive. He is the one driving all the action, & she rides along semi-passively for most part. I imagined her the experienced seductress. She's more of a teenybopper half-heartedly playing mind games because she can."
3,Bad copy?,The movie was deleved quickly. The quality was not great. There were a half dozen 1 second skips in one scene. No big deal. But the last 15 minutes had issues. The voice stopped matching the mouth movements. Like an old apanese horror flic bad voice over. Annoying.
3,"Slow, very slow",It's very close to the book but the movie could have added more. A younger girl than Sue Lyon would have been better even though she did a great job. Slow.
2,Test of time,"Although Kubrick was a master fim maker, this film was constrained too much by the moralistic taboos of the time &cinematic conventions. So, despite the courage in tackling pedophilia & incest ,Kubrick's film did not stand the testof time for me."
2,NOT ENHANCED FOR 16X9 TELEVISIONS,"As much as I appreciate a new release of this classic film, I am at a loss to understand why they would give it a widescreen treatment and not enhance it for widescreen televisions. All of the two-disc special editions in the new Kubrick boxed set are enhanced, and yet this one (not part of the set, but released at the same time) is not. If you're a Lolita fan you should stick with the original 1:33 version. This one will only frustrate you."
3,No extras whatsoever,"It baffles me why go to the effort to transfer these great films to Blu ray format and then include nothing with them. All this disc has is the film and the theatrical trailer. Such an important milestone picture should be packed with extras and commentaries.Not certain what Blu ray edition another reviewer received; I have the stand alone Blu ray version, and it is in 16 x 9 aspect ratio. However its important to note that like Dr. Strangelove, Kubrick played around with the aspect ratio on this film, varying it with shots and scenes. I believe the only edition that captures the multiple aspect ratio print correctly is the Criterion version."
3,SAW IT ON TV,"I saw this movie on TV on TCM a little while ago. It is without a doubt worth watching once, if not worth buying. The acting by James Mason and Peter Sellars is way more than you even have a right to expect from those two great performers. Not only that, but the plot is interesting and holds your attention right to the end. I only wish the DVD has more special features on it. But really, if the only problem with a movie is the fact that there aren't enough extras on the DVD, then that means the movie is one hell of a good one.A definite must see."
3,A Trip,"You know I have been hearing in most of these post how Humbert Humbert just ""loved"" Lolita so much, but not one time have I heard how Lolita felt about Humbert. Old Humbert was just another (...)to me; Why would he go and get with this woman looking for love(just as desperate as u please) just to get to the daughter? what does that look like to you? And if Kubrick had used a younger Lolita than Sue Lyons(one that was truly around 12 as the book said)I don't think that movie would have been made at that time; That would have been a bit profane and out of order; Then why lie to the child about her mother's death? going about the country acting like a bunch of lovesick controlling cows and having folk looking at you all cockeyed. Then having another man(...)follow you, even to come into your house to ""advise"" you on what to do; Uhh Uh;Just another (...)beating you to your own game;"
2,USE A 12 YEAR-OLD!!!!!,"First of all I want to say that i really loved the booklolita.But when i saw the movie it was a big dissapoitment,and thats a shame for such a beautifull story, lets startwith the main characteur 'lolita' of course, yeah suresue lyon is a beautifull girl in the movie ,but lets face itshe's just 2 old, she has 2 play a 12-year old, and whe all knowhow whe are when whe where 12 right?Her real age was fifteen!!allright i thought mabey she could play her part real good.But instead she plays the nymphet of 12!!!, she actslike a grown-up not only that....she even looked older than her real age, in spite of that they diddn't want to shock the worldwith giving the part to a real 12-year old girl, i think it was better that they did!!! IM 12 YEAR OLD MYSELF.if you want some advice from me watch lolita 1997 with jeremy irons."
4,Passionate romance leads to murder and lust !,"Excellent Stanley Kubrick film starring James Mason, Sue Lyon, Shelly Winters and Peter Sellers. Tweleve year old Lolita (Sue Lyon) becomes sexually involved with aged proffesor (James Mason). Outstanding performance by Shelly Winters as Lolita's sex-starved mother and Peter Sellers as the bizzare Claire Quilty. Unfortunately, Sue Lyon is misplaced ; she looks too old for her role. Based on the banned French novel by Vladimir Nabokov. Nicely remade in 1998 by Adrian Lyne."
5,"Little Lo, The Story Of A Nymphet","Kubrick's masterpiece of 1962 with James Mason & Shelley Winters. It far surpasses in every way the 1998 remake (although I loved Jeremy Iron's portrayal of Humbert). Sometimes the imagination is more graphic & shocking than what is able to be filmed (especially in 1962!).Plus, the B&W lends itself well to Nabokov's novel... Read the book! It is MOST EXCELLENT also!"
3,"""SHE'S AN EASY LOVER""","Probably the most controversial,""banned in Boston"" movie of 1962;the ban helped to send literally hundreds of thousands crashing through theater doors to see it.All the commotion was caused by young Sue Lyon, sunning herself in her back yard,very modestly clad by today's standards, being ogled by ""dirty old man"" James Mason. Mason wants her bigtime, and finally succeeds, but only after marrying Lyon's mother,who is quickly killed in an auto ""accident"".As Curly Howard might have said: ""he's supposed to be her father,now he's trying to be her husband"", Enter Peter Sellers, playing multiple roles, trying any and all schemes to drive Mason away, thus assuring Sellers an unfettered ""expressway"" to Lyon's heart. In the end everyone loses, especially the censors: today the film is unrated."
2,Not worth the time,"Having read the book, I naturally wanted to see the film. Unfortunatly, I have very few good things to say about the film adaptation. I was wholly disappointed with this film, especially since Nabokov wrote the screen treatment. I'm not a big Kubrick fan, but I have enjoyed most of his movies. This one, I'm afraid, is not worth bothering with. The direction is rather sketchy with odd black-outs denoting chapters or segments of the film. The sudden naration of Humbert's diary is ill-conceived and the acting is over the top too often.The characters are mere skeletons of what they were in the novel. What made the book so paralyzing was taken out. One is made to sympathize with Humbert rather than hate him. Lolita, on the other hand, is shawn to be a temptress and not as a child who is forced into Humberts cruel world.Unless one has read the book or is a die-hard Kubrick fan, stay away from this film."
1,Good if you haven't read the book before,"It's a Kubrick movie, so it just cant be a bad one. Nonetheless, Lolita-Sue Lyon- is supposed to be twelve and looks at least eighteen. Sellers is completly out of place. The most unapealling thing about this movie is that it has, basically, nothing to do with the book itself. And you just don't read Nabokov's Lolita. You LIVE it. So it's kinda desappointing. However, apart from that, Mason's excellent, Sue Lyon even more and Winters extraordinary. Sure, if you don't want to watch Nabokov's Lolita, this movie is one of the best inspirated and courageous of Kubrick."
3,excellent expression on feelings,"like I said, the movie expressed feelings of a human in a very realistic manner."
1,Running Time,"Hi,I have a copy of Lolita released by WarnerVideo. Its running time goes for only 147 minutes - the original goes for 152 minutes. Why has this movie of 1962 been cut in this way.How can I obtain a version of this movie that runs for the whole time.thanks."
4,A necessary correction,"Sometimes one simply must deny all decency and force a loaded fist down a fool's throat. The silly page-duster from New York - no doubt whisking pages of another great book with his feather of knowledge two woeful floors below me - has worked a misleading platitude into the impressive emphatics: ""LOLITA"", ""SATIRE"".""I can only repeat that I have neither the intent nor the temperament of a moral or social satirist."" -- V. Nabokov, Strong Opinions, pg. 22My movie review: Wonderful, brilliant, but the time was not right, the tiptoeing is obvious, a second and third viewing can be disappointing."
3,"Very good, but not Kubrick's best","Well, i think this film is very good, but i think kubrick wasted his time in making it. Kinky sex and some violence make this a film that only needs to be seen once."
3,Least Favorite Kubrick Film,"Stanley Kubrick is my all-time favorite director. Even with his less well regarded later works I have always found something to redeem them. ""Lolita"" is another story. I could care less if I never see this film again. It's nothing inherent in the production of this film. The movies tag-line asks the question,""Who would want to make a film of ""Lolita?"" That begs the question, ""Why would anyone want to make a film of ""Lolita?"" I found the film's source material, the novel by Vladimir Nabokov, to be perverse. Even with the restrictions laid down by the production code in 1962 this film still seems tawdry. I feel like I need a shower after watching it. That is not to dismiss the technical attributes of the film. Kubrick is still a master storyteller. Nor, the work of the main actors,James Mason, Peter Sellers, Shelley Winters, and Sue Lyon. It's just that so much enterprise was put into a project with so much talent and it just wasn't worth the effort."
2,"Shelly, Sellers, Song: ANNOYING!!!","captivated by how 1962 could adequately portray a sensitive pedophile with competition from a menacing one... Sue is perfect in her powerful role to seize the day via male manipulation.... if Stanley had his way, one wonders what scenes he envisioned, even by todays standards this is one of the creepiest attempts to evoke sympathy for a social deviant with limited consequences... even Quilty is laughing at his own demise, surprised he didn't impersonate a 12yo for Humbait... plot did leave me hanging with the vehicle stalking that was a different model than the one at the gas station and the unexpected U Turn, not sure I recommend this for anyone, Sellers is more appropriately showcased in Strangelove, Winters in Poseidon or Anne Frank, as for Mason, ANYTHING but this drivel...."
1,Will not play on the LG BD300 Blu-Ray Player,This Blu Ray Disc will not play on my LG BD300 Player. I have other Region Free discs that do. I just downloaded the latest Firmaware and no luck. It plays fine on my Sherwood BDP-5004 Blu-ray player. The film itself is a 5 star film.
5,Entertaining and controversial,"Lolita is a very entertaining and charming film. Sue Lyon is perfect as Lolita, as is the very talented James Mason in the role of Humbert Humbert. The book of the same name was very controversial back in the early 60's because it featured a middle aged man who was obsessed with the pre-teen daughter of his girlfriend. In the movie version, Lolita's age was increased by a few years, but even with this accomodation, the film still became cotroversial."
5,Excellent Product,Highly recommend this product. It has enable me to listen to my mp3 through my radio in the car.
5,Works!,"When I bought my e260, I knew somwhere, sometime, I was going to run the battery down in the middle of nowhere! Now that concern is gone - with this excellent Belkin charging kit, you can recharge the battery on the road, or at work, or..... This isn't my first Belkin product, and I guarantee it won't be my last. You even get a spare Sandisk brand USB cable, so you take one with you, and leave one at home/work/etc."
1,"Don't bother, broke immediately",Used it one time and it stopped working. Don't waste your money or time. USB cable still works but can't use it to charge in wall.Belkin Sandisk Sansa Charging Kit
4,worth it,"The Belkin Sandisk Sansa charging kit was inexpensive, and a pretty good buy. It seems to work just fine for my purposes. Durable enough to probably last the lifetime of the Sansa View that I use it with."
4,Great addition to my Sansa kit,"Sure, there are much cheaper options out there than the Belkin kit. I wanted an AC charger for my Sansa C250 but I didn't trust the cheaper ones (not that this was terribly expensive). Since it's modular, this kit provides a backup cable for transferring data to my MP3 player. I believe I can also use the AC and car adapters with other USB-charging devices, like my BlackBerry."
2,Poor performance if 20-30' from router,I found that if you place this device in a diferent room from the router the performance drops considerably. I have a new home so the wiring is good and I only got about 11% of my original speed by putting the second device about 20'+ from my office to the great room. I called Netgear CR and this is a common experience.
1,Bugs galore,I also ordered 2 cases of the almonds and gave a box to my mother. Both of us were unpleasantly surprised to find little bugs crawling on the inside of the packages. I am truly grateful that I noticed the bugs when I did.
1,If you like creepy crawlies...,"I received my order about 2 weeks ago. After sharing three bags with my 3 year old and husband and thinking these were so yummy, I realized that the 4th bag I opened was infested with bugs. Upon inspecting the remaining 20 bags, I could see little black bugs crawling over the nuts inside the bags. I will be requesting a refund. I hate thinking that the nuts we already ate probably had bugs as well."
1,BUGS! BUGS! BUGS!,"The nuts are great...if you like bugs in them! Unbelieveable! I did not notice them at first until I had opened up a bag and had poured the almonds out on to a plate when I noticed bugs crawling around. I broke open one of the nuts and there were bugs inside! Again, unbelieveable!Obviously, NOT RECOMMENDED!"
5,This has become our favorite Christmas CD,"And we have a collection of Christmas CD's that's easily over 30 discs. Every performance is a quality performance and there's a great mix of every genre of Christmas music - from the solemn hymns (O Holy Night, Silent Night) to classical (Nutcracker, Hallelujah Chorus) to pop songs (Sleighride, Jingle Bells). And there's a nice mix of instrumental vs. choir-sung vs. solo-sung. I guess it's why our family always gravitates to this CD over all the others - there's something here for everyone to enjoy. And at 25 songs for over an hour's worth of music, it's a bargain in terms of bang for your buck. You won't be disappointed."
3,"Exellent for quick reading, Exciting and fast paced.","Sam McCall reminds me of Lawrence Sanders, Archy McNally character. Without the promiscuity. The story is about contemporary western issues and had a surprising and satisfying ending. Not much obvious violence and no blatant sexual overtones. I'd recomend it for teenagers or anyone interested in environmental issues, politics and mystery."
3,"Important Subject, Charming Protagonist","Senate race, murder mystery, local color, and ecology fuel this intro into a new series. Nice that Sam, the viewpoint character, points gentle fun at his lack of super-hero abilities, and his attraction to female co-worker is not the usual sweat-inducing sheet-churning acrobatics. Good balance of the importance of the environment and local people making a living. I'll want to follow up with Evans."
5,what a great book for the birthing community!,"This is a lovely book! The author is NOT a midwife or a doctor, but a child bith educator which is why the book deals mainly with the psychological aspects of pregnancy and birth. In my opinion it is very well written, and there is some relevant information for anyone who is in the birthing community!"
3,"Very toxic, but nonetheless, effective.","We only had one carpet and one small couch to treat and we ended up using the whole can. It doesn't say to use a face mask when applying, but it definitely should! I have moderate asthma and even after vacuuming every speck of this powder up, I'm still wheezing two days later. My partner got a severe headache from it as well. Also, I don't know if other people have had this issue, but the powder does not vacuum up very easily. In order to get all of it off the carpet, I had use the vacuum hose on every square inch. Even after getting it all up, the smell is very overpowering. It's a very unpleasant lemon cleaner scent.But I give it 3 stars for working. I mean, it's been two days without a flea bite, so overall I'm happy with the product, although I don't think I'd buy it again because of the scent and the difficult mess."
1,doesnt work,"Used this product until it was completely gone, its either we had a really bad infestation or it is a horrible product. Either way it didn't work for the fleas at all"
4,Zodiac Carpet & Upholstery,This cleaner has a very sweet odor.Care must be taken around pets and children.Ihad to leave the house for 4 hours.The powder does work and must remain in placefor the 24hour period.Thank goodness I have no children or pets.
1,Avoid Voyetra Like the Plague!,"Voyetra is a terrible company to deal with!! T.M. Piano has very specific hardware requirements, and Voyetra will absolutely NOT help you figure out what components will satisfy those requirements. They refuse to list sound cards and MIDI keyboards that will enable the program to run properly, and when you try to ask them what hardware you can purchase, they refuse to tell you. And when you purchase hardware which will supposedly satisfy the program's requirements, Voyetra tells you it won't work. It is therefore a complete mystery to me how a customer can possibly determine what hardware to use. Save yourself the frustration and deal with a company that will actually give you proper customer service instead."
5,a wonderful collection,"This book is a total delight. I can't decide who I like more: the ""professional"" writers like Ron Carlson, Cynthia Ozick, Allegra Goodman, David Sedaris, etc., or the amateurs whose diaries are amazingly well written and moving. You certainly get a voyueristic sense from some of these--it is a guilty thrill to read someone's diary. But mostly you just get a ton of great writing. This is fabulous!"
1,"Unless you have other iGo stuff, don't get this","Igo went cheap on the design of this tip. It won't stay in the phone like the palm branded charger will. Works perfectly if you set the phone down, don't touch it and don't go over any bumps. I have other iGo stuff, so I live with it. If you need a charger just for your treo, stick with the oem one.UPDATE: After numerous complaints, iGo redesigned the tip. If you have an old one, they'll replace it. If you buy a new one, make sure it says rev.H, not rev.02. Not sure how H follows 2."
1,Tastes like a dead thing smells,"Noni 100 - 100% Pure Noni Juice - By Genesis Today - 32oz BottleI bought 6 bottles because you got one free at the time. Genesis should tell the public that Noni is nicknamed 'The vomit fruit'. There is a reason for that. My husband won't even help me choke down the other five bottles. I would only buy one bottle first to see if you can stand the taste. The company isn't the problem, fast delivery, nothing broken. The product tastes like a dead thing smells!"
3,Regional editions appear to be duplicates,"Be aware that all of the regional editions appear to be exactly the same except for covers and (strangely) the authors. Compare the table of contents and index from region to region and see if you dont see this. I compared the Northwest, Southwest, and this Great Plains edition, and the TOC and Index show no differences that I could see. Note that the guidance on selecting plants is general, not specific to the region covered by a particular edition."
3,"Adequate, but not Outstanding","Three and a half stars. This is a good, but not outstanding book on Christian approaches to sexual ethics. It is not heavily dogmatic, and actually reads much more like sociology than theology in most places. It integrates sociological, and psychological findings with their Biblical analysis, which seem fairly mainstream. They try to represent a diversity of opinions, and succeed modestly well enough, I should say. For those in need of a text that seems fairly middle-of-the-road and addressed the issue of Christian responses to the complex topic of human sexuality, this book should serve that purpose well. At some places they hold back too much on their own conclusions, and could have offered more. Students should find it a fair and comprehensive read, however."
5,Just be careful when picking up the shipment.,"Great product, I ordered from Amazon and like it so far. Each bottle is 200oz which is big and heavy probably not suitable if you live in an apartment. Be extra careful when picking up the box; Amazon packs the small box housing the two bottles in a big box that is 3-4x the size of the smaller box, so the weight is all shifted to one side, so it can be tricky when picking it up from your porch and you can easily hurt yourself."
5,Very Good Product for the Price,"I've used Dreft, Ivory Snow and Baby All. Baby All cleans very well and has a very light fragrance. It's a good deal!"
1,Start with Meat Puppets II....avoid this like the plague.,"This is considered to be a masterpiece by a small group of record snob hipsters. It will even tell you so in the liner notes of the re-issue. Fact of the matter is it's horrible. The Meat Puppets NEVER played these songs live after they recorded their next album because......that's right, it's horrible. The lyrics(which you'll have to read because you can't understand them) are nonsense. They didn't move on to a new style because they couldn't top this album like some people will tell you, they moved on because they started making much, much better music."
1,buy any other MP album instead,"The Meat Puppets are one of my favorite bands, but I started listening to them only with their second most recent album (Too High To Die). If you've heard any of their albums after this one, you are not prepared for the seemingly PCP-induced banshee shrieking which is at the center of this album and its bonus cuts. Even covers of songs like Niel Young's ""I Am a Child"" and the G. Dead's ""Franklin's Tower"" are just so manic it sounds like a huge mess. There's actually some good music going on underneath it, but the singing just can't be taken seriously. The Puppets totally reformed their sound for their second album and its successors, and it's a damn good thing. Instead of continuing to make this senseless music for crackheads, they made some of the most outstanding albums in Modern Rock. Check out MP II, Mirage, Too High to Die or No Joke instead!"
3,BWAAPA MAURHYTGHPPPPPTH,"BWAAA! JEKOLIMONYFHTPTHHTTPPTHHH....ZAKASOWERYU TIUN Y HUIY BWAAAAAAHHHHHPPPPHH!There's your prize for buying this little stinker. Completely incoherent jizzmajazz set to fast and squirrely music. The music's great. The vocals twist and squirm through mazes of mush. Make your own soundtrack! You get to decide what the hell's going on with the lyrics.Besides that, Meat Puppets struck a reverberating originality chord here. Get your friend to buy it first and then laugh and enjoy it together."
4,"good music, and you can chase people away with it","Beautiful guitar work and crazy unintelligible vocals. You really have to be in the mood for this one (or just put it on to chase away the uninitiated). It's not really ""hardcore,"" it actually sounds a lot like Meat Puppets II except for the vocals. My theory is Curt Kirkwood was trying to disguise the fact that he can't sing. On Meat Puppets II he just accepts it, and the result is a masterpiece."
3,Its okay,"Its not a bad watch, seems pretty sturdy. Would look better without printing on the crystal, and the movement is extremely loud. If it is near my bed it keeps me up at night. Seems like it will last a while though (for a mechanical anyway)"
5,Ak 4005,"I received my item very quickly. Great service and great quality! Thank you very much.delivery estimate: November 19, 2009 - December 7, 2009 - today 12.11.2009 just amazing,I am from Bulgaria,thank you again."
3,Buy Slim & Lean and To the Core seperately,"I really enjoy the Get Ripped Slim and Lean workout! It's really effective, although lacking a little on the ab work. Get Ripped to the Core is tough and has very different moves. The original Get Ripped is so much like the Slim and Lean workout, but not as tough. I never use it and wish I would have just bought the two I like seperately.All of these videos include cheesy new age type motivational comments by Jari which are really silly. No video is perfect, so I just roll my eyes and keep working out."
5,Great workout,Very much like the body pump at Gold's Gym. A wonderful and complete work out in your home. Not for the novice.
3,Okay,"I will still use these videos to build muscle, but Jari is VERY slow in these videos. My heart rate only occasionally gets up and I didn't burn nearly as many calories as I had hoped, given their name. Again, for an hour long DVD, very slow, but you'll still get results overtime."
3,My ripped review,I would say this dvd is for someone who does not need to burn fat and just needs to maintain. it does work your muscles pretty good however there is no cardio. i have to do 25 min. of cardio before this workout to sweat. there is way too much stretching and talking after each set which caused me to cool down and stop sweating so i just fast forward and stretch at the very end.
3,Great workout!,This is a great pack of videos that really did what they said they would do! I have not become bored nor have I found them quick to overcome....Jari is encouraging and the variety of modifications is very helpful! You will enjoy these!
3,More like 3 1/2- Good adv. workout but a bit dry,"I do not regret buying these videos but I just personally need more. Some say you do not workout to be entertained but a certain level of enthusiasm from the video's participants has to be there for me. It is hard enough getting motivated to workout...and I'm not talking about whopping and hollering like fools which can get old fast. I guess I am used to Cathe who has just the right amount of enthusiasm w/o being annoying. However, I will purchased Jarci's 1000 dvd because she really is a good instructor and variety is always good."
2,Boring and Easy,"I was disappointed with this DVD considering the title and how good Jeri Love looks. It would be good for beginners to weightlifting, but as an experienced weightlifter who is trying to build an at home routine, the DVD is really easy. Just to give an example, I think the routine includes maybe 8 push ups and 12 lunges on each leg. The DVD is well intentioned, but Jeri Love lacks enthusiasm, giving a few weird winks and smiles once in awhile. Oh, and even as a fan of techno music, the background beats in this video are really dull, bordering on annoying."
2,Boring!,"Granted, Jari looks great and she isn't the perky, annoying fitness instructor one often gets on a workout DVD. But, that being said, she's too slow & boring for me.The exercises itself might indeed work great and get you 'ripped' over time, but I find myself rather watching 'normal' tv 1 hour while lifting weights than popping in this DVD. To me, working out must be fun and I clearly don't enjoy this one! (Actually none of her workouts work for me, personally. I rather stick to the FIRM and Tae Bo!)"
4,Jari Love,These are good CDs. The best one is the Get Ripped 1000. It combines cardio and weights and is a good workout for men and women to do at home. My boyfriend was surprised how difficult it was how much he sweated and how high it got his heart rate!
3,Jari Love 4 Pack,"I put myself at an intermediate workout level. After saying that I would say that out of the 4 DVD's included that the Get Ripped is a mellow workout. I use that one if I don't want to break a sweat and am a little tired that day. Slim and Lean and Ripped to the Core are fairly good workouts. The Get Ripped 1000 is the one I really have problems with. First off there is no quick instruction on the exercise set coming up so by the time you watch it, you've lost a little time. But the worst thing is this workout uses the step bench and is being turned from one way to the other for each use. I don't have a lot of space and like I said it goes right into the set so I was constantly pausing the video to rearrange my step so I could see the TV to follow along. I will not use this DVD very often. If it had been better coordinated it would have been a good workout."
5,Love this set!,"One of the best workout set of DVD's I own, and trust me, I own A LOT. I like no nonsense, get the job done type workouts and this definitely provides those types of workouts. Yes, the dialogue can be a little boring and dry and the sets a little bland and cheesy but the workouts themselves is what carries these DVDs. Jari does a great job keeping things intense and varied. You aren't just going to do 3 sets of 8, you do three sets of 8 with pulses, holds, etc. The hour flies by and you definitely get a great workout. I actually look forward to putting in these DVD's, and that says a lot."
2,story was weak,"I tend to agree with reviewer, Margaret Ogilvie, about this book. I was interested in learning more about style icon, Babe Paley, and her family and although the author did tell the interesting story of her upbringing (father was famous brain surgeon, Henry Cushing) and subsequent marriages of the 3 sisters, I found the story lacked substance. I didn't really feel I left the book knowing anything more about Babe Paley or her sisters. I learned, for instance, that Betsy married to FDR's son and they had a troubled marriage but it (Grafton's story) seemed like distant heresay. I've read great biographies and this was not one - I felt I was, as Margaret Ogilvie said, reading a compilation of newsclippings. I read through this book, unimpressed and rather disappointed. I'm hoping there are other books available about the Cushing sisters, specifically Babe Paley."
3,its okay,i love that book very well written and caracheters are awsome it's okay for historical review very good company well
4,"Cafe society, politics, and scandals","I thought it was a good book, it kept immersed in the fabulous lives of the Cushing sisters."
5,The Most Accurate Hiking Book Ever,I bought this book prior to a trip to Oregon in hopes of finding some beautiful hikes. This book was a valuable tool in my search. Every hike was accurately described from details on finding the trailhead to distances traveled including the level of difficulty and points of interest along the way.
5,Treasure Oregon on your feet!,"This wonderful hiking guide does indeed disclose to the reader some almost unknown trails. I was born and raised in the Portland area and frequently made stops with family or friends while driving Oregon's highways. There are numerous unmarked trails heretofore quite unknown to the average person. This volume gives access to a number of those ""hidden"" gems. My all-time favorite Oregon hike is along the trails above Multnomah falls. If you run them, with the cool air there, you will experience the all time natural high! The Columbia Gorge is truly a miracle for the Oregon hiker. I hope you appreciate what you have there! For the most part, I just get to fantasize by looking at this volume. Be sure to check out trails on the way to the Oregon Coast. There are lots of hidden ones there!"
5,Best Black Flag Material,"Dear Gentle Eared People,While I do enjoy some of the Henry Rollins era Black Flag, those first EPs are pure punk rock masterpieces.Tastefully Yours,Master of Taste"
4,not bad for a first time listener,"I really liked this CD because it combined most of Black Flag's songs onto one CD. I'm a first time listener, and I definately liked it!"
5,The First Four Years and the First Four Singers,"This is a solid choice and show cases, in my opinion, the best that the Flag has to offer. I personally prefer Keith Morris and Ron Reyes (Chavo Pedarist)over Dez Cadena and Henry Rollins. Best songs; Nervous Break Down, Wasted, No Values, White Minority, Revenge, Jealous Again, You Bet I've got something Personal Against You, etc.."
3,Interesting,"This collection shows a pre-hardcore-legend-Black Flag that was still searching it's true musical identity. The songs here are essentially punk rather than hardcore, but you can hear the seeds for their glory days here."
3,The Embryonic Stage,"Regardless of the attestation by ardent punks with little scope- this was NOT Black Flag at its peak. This compilation instead illustrates a musical outfit with potential yet didn't fully separate itself from the rest of the pack and whose best work had yet to come. ""Jealous Again,"" ""Nervous Breakdown,"" ""Six Pack,"" and ""Wasted"" by and large lack the intesity of an embittered Henry Rollins but are still nonetheless well written gems by Greg Ginn which have aged rather well after almost thirty years! If you must restrict your collection to Black Flag only in its infancy- then at least purchase ""Damaged"" as well to accompany this."
4,fun,"I got it for my grandson. He likes strange stuff and he didn't complain about it, so I guess it was fine."
5,New Artist Radio ( NAR ),We here at Webzine have watched this new artist open on the charts at NAR at the #10 spot . Much to our supprise he was # 2 in 6 days. DJ's are the major voters representing the New Artist Radio Charts. We expect to be working with Kennie. In the future an artist that catches the ear of so many DJ's so soon we decides we should work with his talent.
5,Where is this guy ?,"Kennie is a real cuttie, and I love his style of music . I am a fan, and will be waiting for him to bring his show to my area. If you haven't heard the CD yet you are missing the making of a star. Mandie"
5,kennie's band Shattered Sun,"Hello Kennie fans! My name is Andrea and I sing in a band called Shattered Sun and we play for Kennie.We've been in the ""closet"" preparing our Live show.So we will be on tour very soon.Our tour will be called Roadhouse and Tearooms tour 2001.We are very excited!The show will be very energetic, so if you like to ""rock"" don't miss us!Thank you for picking up Kennie's c.d. he is a great guy and he has a big heart,it means a lot to him!As for us Shattered Sun ,we are appreciative to get this oppurtunity and we will make the best of it!WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YA'LL ON THE ROAD! Music is our passion our everything!CHECK US OUT WE WON'T LET YOU DOWN!! PEACE,ANDREA :)~"
2,Not as good as I'd hoped for...,"The cover was enticing, and I was hoping for some real advice from a newlywed when I was about to get married. I didn't realize this book was really more satire than anything. You get lots of anecdotes from the author on her married life - many of which I can't really relate to. Omigod! We have to learn how to pay the bills!(Huh?). There is a lot of ""why do men do what they do"" that can be really entertaining - some parts are definitely cute and funny, and the writer has a great voice. However overall the author comes across as just a bit naive for my taste."
5,Can't stop laughing,"Jenny Lee is either living my life or watching me, because this book is so perfect and funny. I keep reading excerpts to my husband because they are almost exact replicas of situations the two of us have had. This book to a quick and hilarious read. Can't wait for more from Jenny Lee."
1,Train Wreck of a Book,"I couldn't stop reading this book because it was so bad and I couldn't imagine it getting worse - and it did!! As a newlywed (and a New Yorker) myself, this book immediately caught my eye in the bookstore, but I was painfully bothered by the trite and superficial ""story"" that the author told. Who is Jenny Lee anyway and why does she think we want to hear what she has to say? I thought her anecdotal stories were irrelevant (if even true) and her insight was insulting. She portrayed herself as an immature (unemployed) whiner who happened to snag a hunky doctor for a husband. I mean really who reduces their happiness to proximity to Bergdorf Goodman??"
1,why get married?,"people are very divided on this book, but i wasn't into it. i guess the author is trying to be funny but she is so shallow, petty, and self centered, it seems to me that she wanted a wedding and not a marriage. last time i checked i enjoy hanging out with my husband, don't really care if he beats me at scrabble, or uses my shampoo. because those things don't matter. i guess if the book was funnier or more insightful i could have gotten beyond the whinning. but when you start the book basically complaining that you went to st. lucia, i can hardly relate."
2,disappointing,"I read this book on a plane, trapped with no other reading, and wished I'd brought more options. it is entertaining enough, with observations on newly married life, but every observation has been made before in much the same way. I am a newlywed, too, but Lee seems very proud of herself for being a newlywed and thnking about marriage a bit, and chapters like, ""who cooks dinner?"" just don't do it for me. Plus, her repeated comments about wanting to be a thin bride, wanting to be a thin wife, and how to not tell the truth to your husband because he may not ""like"" you if you do, disappoint the semi-liberated reader. This book feels like a throwback disguised as contemporary, and treats marriage like a manipulative game of deceit-and not in a funny, wry way, either."
2,Not as great as I thought it would be...,"This is a funny book, but didn't deliver on some of the cover promises, like help on finding other couples to double date with. I like anecdotes and stories as much as the next person, but most of her stories go on and on. There is some helpful advice for brides-to-be, though you have to really dig for it. If you want to read a book that may be more helpful to you, try ""What No One Tells the Bride""."
2,"Not funny, not helpful","My wife picked this up at a garage sale. Even though the seller said she didn't like it, my wife thought it might be funny. She put it down after a few chapters, saying it was stupid. I took a look at it, thinking I might learn something about the female mind. I don't know about the dude that said he liked it, but I can't name one guy who'd enjoy this book. There's just not a lot there. I disagree with the reviewer from L.A. who keeps writing glowing reviews about it. The book wasn't funny and it wasn't helpful - at least for us, and we got married last year."
3,Salinger minus the genius,"McInerney writes well, there's no doubt about that. But somehow one gets the feeling that he is trying to be the new Salinger, and falling far short of the mark. The characters are somehow too shallow, dont have any real or even imaginary issues, just drift mindlessly from one orgy to another, and in a few pages at the end they see the light. Good light read for a flight, and far superior to ""bestsellers"" - thats all I can say."
2,Why bother reading this book?,This is like a short story prepared for a creative writing class. The dialogue stinks and there is no plot. Really makes the author look unskilled.
4,Allison Poole character based on Rielle Hunter,"Jay McInerney has said that Rielle Hunter, suggested to be the paramour of John Edwards, was the inspiration for the Allison Poole lead character. Whoa! If the real Rielle Hunter/Lisa Druck is only half as messed up as Allison Poole, she's still a major league twit!The book is well-written and reads like a diary, especially impressive considering that the author is not a woman. It's an interesting, graphic time capsule of the greed and drug-influenced decade of the 1980s in New York.But I confess, I read it mostly to find out the Allison/Rielle connection. In that respect, it was very revealing."
1,What An Overrated Writer!,"A deeply cynical and thoroughly dishonest book, written by a smug man who obviously did not understand young women, even in New York City in the 1980s, and rendered them as sexual and social sociopaths. The book is a long and tiresome sketch with a few good one-liners. It's basically an anti-feminist rant."
5,Eighties Masterpiece,"Together with American Psycho, this is my favorite book of all time.Fantastic. Alison Poole is one of the great fictional characters of the 80s. No wonder Ellis uses her in his universe also.* s p e c t r e *"
4,a portrait of alison pool,"after reading ellis' glamorama, where alison pool plays a minor role, i was interested to see he 'borrowed' this character from mcInerney who writes in a similar style portraying this little 'post-modern girl' with perhaps a little more insight than Ellis gives into his characters everyday life and background. i don't know, i love all these books the way i love to pop a few xanax or codeine in the winter time and curl up on the couch and stare at the ceiling."
4,Throw away Bright Lights,"I read A LOT, and I would have to commend Jay for his ability to write through the eyes of the opposite sex. My only conplaint for the book is that there was very little conflict. I am a sucker for books about addicts. I love them. If you enjoyed this I would love to reccomend: Disco Bloodbath by: James St. James, Fuel-Injected Sreams by: James Robert Baker, Kiss me Judas By: Will Christopher Baer. If you have not read LORD VISHNU""S LOVE HANDLES By: Will Clark GET IT NOW!!!! It is the funniest book I have ever read. I had to hide when I was reading it becuase I kept cracking up while I was reading in public. You will thank me- get it- get it now!!!"
3,Must be good!,"This must be good....bought it for my wife and now she doesn't want to invest in more real estate.....as ""there are too many pitfalls!"""
4,"Informative, clear, and easy to understand","As a young investor, I found this an excellent read and I imagine I will be referring to it for years to come. It offers sound advice on investing - backed by facts in the form of graphics, articles, examples, and clear references. Opinions are clearly marked as such - opinions, and the authors aren't trying to sell you some other product. Aside from covering in detail the topic of active Real Estate investing, it also covers (to a lesser extent)passive real estate investing, tax issues, advice on personal financing, and finally - information on where to learn more.I love this book and I would gladly buy it again if given the choice."
3,How quickly the tide turns,This was all great advise for 2005-2006. Now here we are 2008 and everything is upside-down and the best and safest investments appear to be short-sales and various wholesale flipping stategies for investment. As I read the book I kept being reminded of how a changing market requires a changing approach to investing.
3,Not 2002-2005 anymore,"Not a bad book. I'm writing this review late in 2008, so many of the items the book talks about would probably be a HUGE money risk right now. Maybe pick it up when the real estate industry picks back up...ummm...maybe around 2012. Unless you have cash on hand now to invest in foreclosures or something along those lines. Good informative read nonetheless though."
4,Helpful for most,"This book is helpful for those considering real estate investment - whether to buy and hold, flip or lease. It offers some sound advice to evaluate and purchase. You will find helpful information regarding any one of the three ""methods"" of investment mentioned and more."
5,"Great Information, but with a verbal tick","This book is stupendous! It covers a tremendous amount of information to get you started in real estate investing. My wife and I are starting a real estate holding company and this book has been the foundation of our learning.The only strange thing about the book is that for some reason the authors decided to only use the feminine pronouns ""she"" or ""her"" when referring to general individuals, such as ""It's very difficult for an owner to lose her home and it's often even more difficult for her to...""At first this was just odd, but it became a real distraction and annoyance that they never use ""he or she"" or the common practice in English of using the male pronoun for such situations.Despite this sort of printed verbal tick, this is an excellent book with a lot of information."
3,mighty mini,"I had a hard time finding this product around my area, so ordering it online was about all I could do. I don't think it's so bad-it does move around a lot but it does the job. My arms, neck, and legs hurt when I only do 5minutes for legs and arms each. I believe it's working on the areas that I was needing it for. Thanks."
2,Just alright,"I got this dvd because Im still in the beginner's phase of yoga. Unfortunately, the instructor isn't soothing at all, nasaly voice and too instruction video like for what I feel a beginners yoga session should be like. Had us hold planks for twice as long as we should because he kept talking. I think even the girls on the video were getting annoyed. He would start a new scene without telling us we ended the last one. (So we would be in plank, cut to ""ok, we're standing here like this"".) Not a good beginners yoga video."
5,Perdo Uber Alles,"Short and sweet, just like their songs: The band on this record changed my life. They will change yours."
5,This album changed my life.,"Brilliant from beginning to end. Unfortunately, D died before I had the chance to see them live. Saw Firehose in Tempe after Ragin' Full On - I was the only person in the bar who knew who they were. RIP, D. My recommendation? Listen to this until your ears bleed - it will be worth it."
5,Everything I thought it would be....and then some.,"Cohesion and History Lesson Part 2, just by themselves, are worth the 899 pennies that this album costs. BUY THIS NOW."
5,this album is ESSENTIAL.,"fall in love with the minutemen. NOW. they were the best band in rock & roll, and D. Boon was the best poet EVER. Their music was Art without the pretentiousness. You'll find yourself quoting them - both musically and verbally - for the rest of your life."
4,One of the so called masterpieces of 80's indie,"Of all the grand albums of the the 80's. This was the one that alluded me. While Zen arcade blasted me with caustic hardcore, then smoothed out towards dark psychedelic pop and Meatpuppets II conquered me with its unique blend of psychedelia, country, punk, and Zepplenian classic rock. This record always was a mystery to me . It was like a diabolical hyprid of wire and CCR. For the first 2 listens, it bored me to the point where i wanted to strangle the crooning Boone. Then I listened to it again and I got through the jungle of boring Music and began enjoying it. Especially Corona, Dr. Wu, Dont look now, It aint no picnic and Love dance.Although I still think its a little overrated (Mainly due to the lack of coherenence in the beggining), I still enjoy the majority of the album and would recomend it to anyone looking for something new.Anarchy and peace"
5,Maybe Partying Will Help...,"Revolutionary, political, raw and mostly clocking in at a minute each. This is as funky and chaotic as anything else released by the trio. Watt, Hurley, and Boon have perfected their chemistry on this outing and it shows with the 74 magical minutes this release offers. This is actually a good place to start for those unfamiliar with the trio as it keeps your attention throughout. I might also recommend ""Introducing the Minutemen"" as a starter. Then again, you may find yourself spending a small fortune once you check this one out, in which case the ""Post Mersh Volumes 1-3"" would make an excellent anthology."
5,Good stuff,"This cd is great. It has a great blend of musical styles and Mike Watt is one of my favorite musicians and one of the greatest bassists around. The songs are short and don't really have any verses or choruses to speak of, the lyrics are usually delivered in a beatnik-ish spoken word way.Oh yeah, don't listen to the really lame review by Janitor-X. This guy only appreciates music that is pissed off and angry, anything remotely upbeat or melodic fails to get his stamp of approval."
1,Vastly Overrated,"This album contains 4 ""songs"" which consist of nothing more than the band members starting their car engines. I don't know about you, but this certainly does not qualify as worthwhile music to my ears.Numerous accolades aside, Double Nickels, for the most part, is self indulgent and lacking cohesion. The lyrics are so pedestrian, would you even guess that ""This Ain't No Picnic"" deals with racism?Meat Puppets II, Murmur, and Zen Arcade all blow this one away."
5,Finally bought one,"Finally bought a Minuteman CD. Never got them when they came out because Watt would always hand us a tape--and plus we saw them a million times and somehow their music got engraved on my DNA. This is nothing like seeing them live, NOTHING. But still great. You don't see George Hurley flopping his 'do, a different blue or red or blonde every week. You don't see Mike bopping. You don't see D in his cut off khakis quivering. 1!-2!-3!-4! the song's over and then another and another. What a troika. This CD doesn't capture that but nothing will."
3,Despite all the great material....,"3 1/2 stars....the parts seem to outweigh the whole on this one for me. While no one in their right mind could criticize this album for it's lack of punk ambition and fluidity amongst it's trio of players, the quite unique 43 song lineup does have some drawbacks. The songs are often catchy, and do vary in style-but through the album's continuously abrupt changes due to the material's one-versed nature, an audio pattern resulting in immersion apathy does in fact creep in towards this band's innovative sound. Do not let this less then perfect note convince you that this is not the innovative punk masterpiece it is generally perceived as being, because it is-albeit appreciated best(much like the band's format) in strong, short blasts."
5,Short guide to great music of the early 80's,"Take this, put it alongside Husker Du's Zen Arcade and REM's Murmer and you have an essential guide to American music of the early 80's."
5,"""twinkle, twinkle...blah, blah""","at a time where practically every single punk rock band of the moment were concentrating on who could go louder, play faster, and who could be the most (ahem)...punk rock. along came The Minutemen; a band of goofy guys who made the most perfect working class music that any intelligent, self-respecting ""punk rocker"" could possibly hope to call their own. oy vey. no matter which way yoiu slice it, or how you describe it, the music of The Minutemen remains as profound and sparked with brilliance as when it was first recorded and released upon the unsuspecting masses. elements of jazz, funk, folk, and yes, punk rock...all seemlessly meld into one unclassifiable mass. the sum equals it's parts, and it's beautiful, man."
5,"timeless classic of punk rock, without one punk song on it","True originals, as most of the reviews on here seem to get. This is their 'famous' record, a double lp seemingly made in response to Husker Du's Zen Arcade. Both bands would diverge from 'punk rock' and define it by creating their own sound.The minutemen were jazz inflected, a 3 part outrage. Each musician was so unique and seemed to carve their own song into the music. I am privileged to have seen them and 1-2 years later 'Firehose' without D Boon.'History lesson' is the story of the minutemen from D Boons eyes. Such a sad sweet song about loving their band and how their lives have turned out because of punk rock, made heartbreaking by D Boon's death. He could not have written a more perfect coda to his music and life, if had written this one from beyond the grave.It is not possible to listen to Storm in my House loud enough, I have tried."
5,classic,"o boy. this album is a classic. everything on this album rocks. from the cover to the production to the actual songs.. i love every song here. this cd has that start to finsh classic feel after listening to it. alot of people dont like this album or other rollins flag cds because it isnt punk enough. well obviously. they went in a little differnt direction,.. which i happened to like alot. this is my second favorite black flag cd. the first being my war. do yourself a favor and purchase this cd. if u dont appretiate this disk then i feel bad for you.peace people"
3,not as good as their earlier stuff,"its not bad, and it certainly has a few really good songs (the title track comes to mind), but this was the begining of the end for Black Flag, and it really shows. This is the last album of theirs I would reccommend anyone buy, and its really only for people who are already big fans. If you aren't a big fan, pick up ""Damedged"" or ""The First four years"" instead."
4,SLIP IT ON IN!!YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!,"A good Black Flag effort!! I love the instruments in this, Kira is an awesome bass player, what can I say about Greg, it's already known that he's one of the best. Of course Descendents leader Bill Stevenson is good on the skins! The angry singer Rollins too! But there are problems on this like, some songs just run too long. You have to be in the right mood to listen to the whole thing. I can see how Stephen Egerton(ALL,Descendents) really liked this album, he uses some of the styles of riffs Greg Ginn played on here."
4,Great Digital test book,This is a great book written from professionals in the materia. I personally took the class with Dr. Savir and he is not only a great professor but this book is well worth purchasing.
5,Loving Family Necklace,It looks very nice and as displayed on website. Customer Service both at Amazon and the company supplying the item was very nice.
4,no t.v. party ever again,"the version of ""t.v. party"" used here is good, but not as good as the one on ""damaged"". ""my rules"", however is another story. how this song never made it onto ""damaged"" is beyond me.the vocals are so intense its mind boggeling.the lyrics are my motto for life. ""ive got to run"" is another awesome song, but not good enough for ""damaged"".all in all, this is another good release from the flag."
2,interesting story - dry as toast,"I purchased this book at the recommendation of a Mexican friend and historian. This is written by a past president of Mexico. He said it was very good and for a historical novel, was factually correct and well written. Well the Spanish version might have been well written, but the language in the English version is dry, stilted and has no rhythm or artistry. I know that English and Spanish don't translate very exactly but I've read some beautiful translations (100 years of solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, for example and Aunt Julia and the Script Writer ). This translator appears to try and make this accurately translated instead of interesting. I have to wade my way through it. Because I'm interested in the subject matter, I am continuing to read it, but after 100 pages, I sometimes wonder why."
3,Good but there's a newer model,"Revision to older review - I liked this a lot when I got it, but it died after about a year.Just got a newer model to replace it - Liftmaster 976LM/977LM 390Mhz Wireless Keyless Entry Pad - it's quite a bit nicer than this one and costs the same amount. I would recommend buying that over this.Ordered this keypad to replace an older Craftsman keypad in the same style. WOW - what an improvement. The old keypad often required the code to be entered multiple times, and you had to press the enter button 2-3 times to get the door to open. This one is instant. Couldn't be happier. Changed over in less than 5 minutes. Works for Red/Orange learn button."
5,Got to have it,The Keypad is a must. It is very easy to use and install. Setting a temporary code is very useful when you grant someone access to your garage.
2,Wrong one and not clearly marked,I have a new Chamberlain garage door opener. No where in the description online does it say that this model is for OLD Chamberlain openers ONLY. Waste of time.
3,Had to return. Did not work with my garage door opener,"The packaging of this keypad shows that it does not work with newer garage openers, but the product description on Amazon did not say anything about this. So I had to return it and get the Chamberlain Clicker on Amazon for a little bit more money. That one worked fine."
1,misleading information,"I bought my house and need a remote garage door opener. I bought this one from Amazon and did not pay much attention in reviews. I was too busy to install it until now, but found this remote not only Requires A Red or Orange Program Button but also only for the old model. My garage door opener is Prodrive newer model. It took me much time to figure out the issue by searching web, finally found at [...] said its limitation. I think the seller could have informed everyone in front about this limitation to save buyers time. The worst is I purchased in December 2010, and now found the problem. I can do nothing about it. I am deeply disappointed at Amazon for this kind of practice to its customers.David HMarch 19, 2011"
5,Review,Very happy with the product. Shipping took only three days. Would order from this company again in the future.
5,Wireless Key pad for Chamberlin,Product was exactly what I needed. My old one was damaged from old batteries causing problems opening & closing garage door. This fixed my problem rite a way.Delivery & payment went very smoothly. Will shop here again.
4,Pretty easy to install,"Got the keypad programmed and installed in less than 15 minutes. Wish the product was a little bit more solidly constructed. The full thing is constructed out of (cheap) plastic - cover and base. While opening the package, I accidentally scratched on the side with the scissors and it left a nice mark - that pretty much says about the quality of the material."
2,Came up WAY short,"I loved some of the older TMNT games, but this one is really sad. The graphics are alright, but that's the only good thing to say about it. There is no multiplayer or co-op of any kind, which is unforgiveable. The really sad thing about this game is the near absence of fighting! Yes, its true. You spend most of your time climbing around and navigating the level, and occasionally--VERY occasionally-you get in a fight. But the fights are seriously lame. I just can't believe they released this game, there really isnt' anything to it. 15 levels of basically running around and beating up the occasional batch of punks. Easy achievements if that's important to you, but otherwise don't waste your time--or money."
4,A few nights of fun - Rent this one,The graphics of this one are worthy of the next generation platforms that it was designed for. It roughly follows the movie and is entertaining while you are playing it. There is little to no replay value on this one though and many of the later levels feel like you've already played them. This is a great game if you want to stack your achievement points and is definitely fun for a night or two.
1,tmnt xbox 360 game,"I had to return this game because it did not play, had to say I was a little disappointed and on the game it stated that the game was only $7.99 and they charged me $44.80 talk about highway robbery"
2,Meh,"Alright, I'll admit it right up front. I bought this game for the 1,000 gamerscore and no other reason. I knew it wasn't a very good game, but I also heard it wasn't complete crap. This is true, there are a couple fun sections, and some of the one liners are pretty great, but over all, you're not going to have much fun with this unless A) you're under 12, B) you absolutely love the turtles, C) you accidentally play some other game thinking it's this one. Technically, it works fine, the controls are pretty much fine, and graphically it doesn't look bad. So there's that.Basically, if you aren't buying it for a child, don't expect much. If you're in it for the gamerscore, devote an afternoon to it. The achievements are super easy so it won't take more than one playthrough."
3,Fun game but too short,I rented this game and beat the entire thing in under 6 hours. Some parts are pretty tricky but overall it's a pretty basic game. It is pretty fun but might be worth a rental first. The controls are easy and should be good for all ages.
3,Bought This Game Cause Of The Achievements,I Gotta Be Honest With All Of UI Ordered It & It Arived & The Main Reason I Bought It Cause The Achievements Are So Easy It's Just Like Taking A Candy From A Baby
3,Easiest 1000 achievements since King Kong,"Wasn't expecting much from this game which was good because graphics are sub par/ps2 even through hdmi out, story line is blah, I just skipped through all the cut scenes as they aren't needed to accomplish the game, it's just a liniar platforming/button mashing game, beat in about 7 hours getting all achievements is easy so it was worth the 1,000 points."
4,Ta vacano,"El juego ta bueno, sencillito, divertido para ninos, para nosotros adultos ta excelente para sacarle los logros, son 1.000 puntos facilicimos. lo unico malo es que no tenga live ni 2 players simultaneos.recomendado"
4,Heather's first release,"I just love this artist. I first purchased her latest cd ""woke up more"" and fell in love with her style. She is a wonderful singer who can really rock and I am amazed she is not more popular in the NW area. I have to say that I do like her second cd after this one more but, this one is also very good. I wish her much success!"
4,Better than some.,"This is a fairly standard collection, and better than some I've seen. Nonetheless, one should be aware of the following:* The entire Norse and Icelandic literature is omitted.* Anglo-Saxon poetry also omitted.* Welsh and Gaelic literature is MIA.* As with narrative textbooks on the Middle Ages in Europe, it basically omits Iberia and anything east of Venice (with a few exceptions from Constantinople). In other words, it omits most of the territory and most of the population of Europe in that period.* It follows the current Very Annoying custom of these readings collections: citing where the translations come from, but not the actual source document itself. At times one cannot know, from this text, who wrote what one is reading. I tell you truly, it is moronic to tell me who translated something, while not telling me what they translated it from. Moronic, despicable, and it teaches the students exactly the wrong thing about scholarship and citation."
2,A Mystery bogged down,"I usually love anything written by Patricia Sprinkle, especially her new geneology mystery series, but this one was bogged down in so much Southerness that I could easily have given up reading it before page 10.The fact it cost me more than a regular paperback kept me going.I lived near Atlanta for 10 years and they were a great 10 years meeting wonderful Southerners, but this novel never kept my interest. By the time the mystery got going and became interesting it was almost page 100.Borrow it from a library, but save yourself the money and get a mystery with a bit more punch to it early on that keeps the momentum going the whole way through."
3,Could be a great book.,"My biggest problem with this book is between chapters two and three which has a huge gap. Another chapter should be inserted to ease into the technical jargon of chapter three such as ""What is an embedded system?"" Also a glossary of technical terms and acronyms would not be a bad idea. The author does a good job of explaining the business aspects of being an embedded engineer."
