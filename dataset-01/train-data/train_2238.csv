2,didn't fit head bolts,this socket was too the wrong size for the head bolts on a 2002 1.8L VW engine. it was the correct style of socket but too large.
2,Not as good as the original,These are not as good as the original filters that came with the vacuum. Rather shallow in depth and [inexpensive]. But good enough.
5,Great Documentary,"AMAZING!!! Must watch. This is something we can change and its something that involves every human, not just Americans. We can learn from our mistakes."
2,Ethos,"A Christmas present for my son, whom said it was okay but nothing new. He had seen it all before."
3,Rehashes many topics in disjointed fashion,"This documentary is ok, not great. It attempts to create a grand, global conspiracy (which doesn't really exist) while making many valid points about problems with capitalism, democracy (or the lack thereof), the media, environment and the US government. It covers too much territory and ends up being disjointed, rather than a cohesive story. Less would have been more. While I agree with the solution if offers (i.e., consumers using their purchasing power to change corporate behavior), that solution has no impact on America's permanent war economy and defense spending. What do any of us buy from the defense industry? How can our purchasing decisions affect, for example, Boeing or the Carlyle Group? Answer: they can't."
1,Waste of Time,"This ""documentary"" is a complete waste of time. The piece tries to ""reveal"" so-called secrets about the American government, companies and institutions and how they are all working together at our expense. Some of this is common knowledge, like the Federal Reserve, some of it has no citation or has been taken out of context, such as the quotes it flashes on screen, and some of it is incorrect, such as the information about RFIDs.This is nothing more than blatant fear mongering, that is blissfully ignorant about many of the subjects it covers."
5,Very convenient!,"This is not an instant tea mix. This actually powdered green tea leaves. Hence the cloudiness. This product is convenient to mix into my water bottle that I take to the gym. The finest green tea from an antioxidant perspective is Matcha green tea. It's the tea used in scientific studies that touts green tea's antioxidant properties. It's very expensive but is grown in special areas in japan.I feel this is the next best thing. It dissolves easily and I can take it with me and add to water on the go. I use match a when I'm at home, but this beats buying bottled green tea in quality and it's much more economical."
3,okay,"not what I expected, but not bad. The taste is fine, just very cloudy in appearance. I was hoping to find a ""clear"" green tea....maybe it just isn't out there."
5,I like these,I am very impressed with the tongs. They look stylish and they work well with my ice bucket. I recommend
3,"Old ""Skool"" Kung Fu!!","I went into this one with an over inflated expectation,,,This flick turnd out not to be what I expected,,,however, I walked away entertained by Alexander Lo Rei!! It was just an o.k flick,,,many fight scenes and the choreography satisfactory. If you love you old school kung fun,,,you're safe with his one!!"
5,ONE HOT MIX,"IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY A CLUB CD THIS YR YOU BETTER MAKE ITTHE UNDERGROUND PARTY MIX VOL.4 ITS ""HOT""THE BEST MIX FROM SONG TO SONG THE ENERGY NEVER STOPSBADBOYJOE AND LOUIE DEVITO ARE THE HOTTEST DJ IN AMERICAI HAVE VOL.1,2,3,4 CANT WAIT FOR VOL. 5"
2,Save your money...,"I'd have to say im not to impressed by this cd. Why it has done so well here in the states I have know idea. Maybe its because it has the words NYC and Underground? Anyway for that English guy a couple of reviews down, just remember who created house music first. Hmmmm.. Also why is it that in Europe, American DJ's are highly sought after. Hmmmm... Thick of that while your sitting on your bum! HAHA.. Everyone else, go get a Kimball Collins CD."
2,Cheese anyone?,"Man, after having painfully listened to this entire album all I have to say is that it really ... for true fans of electronic music but would be great for people who are looking for a cd to hype them up before a cheesy ""meat-market"" type of clubnight.This cd would appeal to first time listeners of dance music or shallow clubbers looking to ""hook up"" rather that ""trance out"". I'm a fair individual so I'll give it 2 stars instead of one. We all have to start somewhere I guess.Fortunately this type of dance music is disposable. It doesn't have a ""timeless"" sound that only great dj's can display.If you kids out there are looking for something ""accessable"" that isn't too cheesy then listen to anything by Micro, Paul van Dyk, Oakenfold and Kimball collins. They are all great dj's that have killer skills and their style is not at all ""whacked out."" Eventually if you truly enjoy dance music then you will graduate to the sounds of djs like Mr. John Digweed, Chris Fortier and Dave Ralph."
5,Louie Devito is on some good shit,"This CD is crazy. All the songs are tight techno songs. I have just been starting to listen to more techno. Tonight I was introduced to Louie and his trippy skills. I had put on some skates, and like an hour later my friend asked if I wanted a light show, so I agreed. He put this CD in and then really screwed with my head. I really enjoyed the light show my friend did. He did it to the song Derb. This is really the only song I've heard cause I just got the CD, but that song was just nuts. So who ever likes LOVE, then I strongly recommend the Louie."
5,red cover,The red Palm faceplate looks very sharp with the contrasting black back and cover. I definitely recommend it for lovers of the red/black combo and/or for those who like adding a little spice to their otherwise-boring electronics.
5,"Fun, Distinctive and Ok for the Office","Once I knew there were faceplates, I knew I just had to have one. But given I use my m100 in the office as well, I couldn't go with the red (too bold) or the green mist (too artsy). The silver really isn't that much more exciting than the black, so I decided to go with the blue. I settled for Pacific Blue, though the Blue Mist would have been ok. The nice thing about the blues is that they go well with the Royal Blue PalmGlove. In case you're wondering: the faceplates REPLACE the black faceplate that the m100 comes with, which is easily removed. Once removed, the new faceplate just snaps on. If you want, you can then reinstall the cover the cover that comes with the m100."
4,"Best of the bunch, imho","The Green Mist looks a bit like metallic puke, the Red Mist reminds me of 1980's Lee press-on-nails, the Silver just looks like you are trying to emulate a PalmV, while the Blue mist and Pacific blue are fun yet distinctive. They've got that fashion factor going and yet won't draw guffaws in at the company meetings due to gaudiness. Now some hardcore techheads might snicker at the ""just a trendy toy"" factor of the m100 vs. a PalmV or higher but I think the product's appeal can extend beyond the trendoid-nokia-toting high schooler or the ""computer illiterate"". Frankly, some of just don't have $300+ to drop on the higher end models, and if you are a little crafty you can hack this thing up to approach the speed and memory of the more expensive models. It's great for entry level and the price minded. But I digress. This faceplate is my fave, but I too wish they'd bring the prices down to $10, which is what they are worth."
4,Great color but pricey,I love the color although I wish there was more selection available from PALM. I think the faceplates are a great idea and they're very fashionable however the prices still need to come down. Amazon does have the best prices so far but PALM really needs to sell these at something like [price]. If they did I'd probably buy 10 or more.
5,Very snazzy!,This makes my PalmM100 stand out in a crowd. It was easy to put on once I figured out the picture-instructions. Might have been easier with a little more words.
4,An Awesome New Look For Fall 2000!,"I have heard some say that this ""cheap"" plastic snap-on is ""chinsy"" or ""cheasy"", but I like it! I was narrowed down to the Handspring Visor Deluxe and the Palm m100, however, I chose the m100 because of this new feature. I love colorful accessories and found this to be attractive and the Palm m100 useful. The Pacific Blue Faceplate is one of my favorites and I can match it to many other items I have for school."
5,Adorable,this faceplate is so cute! its pretty and preppy and just a must have to make a dull looking PDA look fantastic! i just love it! the pink is so loveable you will not actually want to show your PDA off!!! MUST HAVE!
2,Not what I expected,"When this came in the mail, I was very disappointed because it looked like cheap plastic. I expected a shiny rich colored blue mist color (just like in the picture). Instead, what I got is this cheap looking blue mist plastic face plate. I gave it two stars because the price is cheap (but I still had to pay shipping and handling). Even so, I still probably would not use this because it's just too cheap looking!"
4,very nice,I like having the contrast of the blue faceplate. Nicely frames out the information on my screen. Easier on my eyes. I like it much better than the black. The faceplate changes easily. And it looks really neat with my blue Palm Glove!
1,Item no as described,These sensors are Universal. You have to cut wires on your used sensor and splice. I would recommend another sensor
2,Disappointed,"Been a fan for a while. True the first album is uniqueand no matter what this group pulls out of their hats,they'll never top it . It was shear perfection and one of a kind.Still la verdad of LA VERDAD is that it is not even worth buying asa bootleg in a corner of Jackson Heights for $3.00.I'm madley disappointed. I kept telling myself and others,they've been quiet, you'll see, they'll blow allthis recent crap out the water. I especially was expectingat least one Reggaeton anthem. MAN! What a let down.The boys got the skills! I hope they get wind of this and tryand get the flavor back. I'll be looking out for the real FULANITO comeback, till then peace and skip this one."
1,THIS BOOK SUCKS!!!!!!,"HOW DO YOU KNOW IF A BOY IS RIGHT JUST BY READING A PERSONALS COLUMN?? ANYBODY CAN SUBMIT THOSE THINGS AND I DON'T LIKE THEM BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW THE PEOPLE AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE REALLY LIKE. THIS BOOK WAS TOO FAR FETCHED. THE ONLY PART I LIKED IS THAT STACEY IS FROM NEW YORK, JUST LIKE ME!!! I AM 9 YEARS OLD AND IN THE 3RD GRADE AND THIS IS THE 17TH BABY-SITTERS CLUB BOOK I HAVE EVER READ AND IT IS THE WORST ONE EVER!!!! DON'T READ IT!!!!!!"
2,Avoid HP's Horrible Software,"The hardware is adequate for the price, with good, vibrant color.But the software is so terribly written, with a clunky, bizarre user interface, that it's a huge pain to get anything done. And woe betide you if you ever need to scan more than one slide at a time with the included transparency adapter. For each slide you must laboriously tell the import software to use the adapter, which you cannot do until it has made a useless preview scan with the flatbed.Avoid this product like the plague. Shame on HP!"
2,read below,"Naturally, the scanner creates good quality images. However, on some images there is an inner, lighter frame which, as I figured out, is the top portion of the flatbed being somehow reflected. I'm trying to find a dark book or something like that to scan those images and for the money I paid I should NOT be worried about this crap. Second, the software is idiotic: made by idiots with idiots in mind, you know one of those that assume you're 10 and just got your first computer ever."
5,A Good Scanner If You Are NOT Using Windows 7,"I bought this scanner used and found while it makes good scans, it's full potential is not realized with Windows's 7."
2,More trouble than it was worth.,Drivers have to be reinstalled repeatedly. Finally got it up and running only to have the lamp burn out.
1,This is Horrible!,I saw the back of the case and I said okay it looks cute and bought it ! Thank God i only spent ten bucks for this piece of trash. The Graphics were horrible and I mean horrible! I liked the idea of the game but I just couldn't get past the graphics!
2,I don't know...,"I don't own this game, but as this is a PlayStation game, it won't have any addons made by fans of the game, and after reading those other reviews, I believe that this sucks.I own the Creatures, Creatures2, Creatures3 and Creatures Adventures for PC, and they were the best games ever. But I just couldn't stand a creatures game without:a) ettinsb) addonsSo I say, only 2 stars.If you're going to buy this, I recommend to buy one of the PC creatures games, not this."
1,This game is really lame...,"I got this game thinking ""Oh wow! This looks really cute!"" but when I started to play the game it was really boring and just plain stupid. I only played this game once and I will never play it again. Don't waste your money on this."
1,horrible,This is the worst game I've ever played. You have to probably three years old or younger to enjoy it.
2,Be frugal with this one,"If you are interested in launching a buiness career, be warned that this is a text full of soft advice that is fairly commonsensical. The author's contacts et.al. do add some glint to her book, but it is only a surface shine. There is little here that most readers do not, honestly, already know. If you are a business insider, you may find this a pleasant soporific. If you are trying to get into this nexus, do not spend your hard-earned money on trifles like this one. It won't help, trust me."
5,Great Album!,"Gabby is undoubtedly one of the greatest, but also unfortunately perhaps one of the most overlooked, calypsonians of this era. His collection of songs spans the entire range within the soca/calypso genre - from social commentary to political satire to humor to plain ""jump up soca"" - Gabby has it all.Such impressive variety is surpassed only possibly by the depth of the composition and the clarity of the rendition.This album is fantastic. The selections adequately incorporates all of the elements alluded to above. I highly recommend this album to everyone - from the serious calypso connoisseur to the person seeking an introduction to the style, range and tempo of the calypso artform.I only wish it had a couple more of his songs. Nevertheless, as it is, it's great!"
3,angel2spawn corner of toys,this is mcfarlane greatest masterpiece yet. the detail on this spawn toy is ultimate. if your not into collecting spawn or just want to start i suggest you get this one.
3,Just a review,"I liked this toy, I originally bought it for my boyfriend back in February and he loves it. He keeps it in its box as a collector's piece, of course, and once I saw it I immediately wanted one for myself. Now his friend owns one as well after seeing it on display in his room. It is definitely tempting to remove it from the box, but it is just too nice of a box to take it out."
4,WORKS WELL,This product seems to work well. I use it twice a week and it does make my skin feel very smooth. I like it and will buy again.
4,Thumbs Up!,"Both family and frequent guests agree: This product, while not a miracle cure, has drastically improved the quality of our dog's breath.It DOES need to be used consistently. When it is, dog love and kisses are an attractive prospect once again.How it works, I have no idea. To be fair, we have also been dumping an anti-plaque in the water bowl, But! We did notice a big difference in the quality of dog breath around here for the month we used Dog Smog Remedy alone (prior to using the anti-plaque).It's good enough for our hippie, dog loving family. You don't know us, but we're scientists so you should trust us anyway! :p"
5,Have not used yet,This polespear is very well built with solid joints and very ligth to carry. It seems to be much more difficult to spearfish with this compared to regular spearguns. But this extra challenge is a good one. I really recommend this polespear for any spearfisher wanting a new experience in the sport!
3,JBL 6' 3-piece pole spear,"I am an avid pole spear fisherman. I bought this pole spear for a trip to Hawaii. I really like how it breaks down and can be stashed in a backpack. The rubber is descent. It has an power range of about the length of the spear. Power range in this case meaning able to penetrate a fish. Unfortunately after the first few shots I took with this spear, the tapered section bent after a glancing shot off a rock. I have also noticed some corrosion where the stainless thread rod joins the tapered section. This is after rinsing the spear well after every dive and only using it a dozen times. My advice, look for a breakdown fiberglass pole spear. This JBL won't last."
4,Hubby Loves It!,"Got this for Hubby's bday, he has been wanting one for a long time. Works great and stores away nicely. Highly recommended...and the price is very comparable to anywhere else."
5,Slick,"I use this on Ford Explorer rear disc kit installed on my Ford 9in rearend on my Jeep. I also use it on my Dana 44, which also has the Explorer kit. This kit has been improved since the first install I did back a few years ago. The cable seems to slide much better, and the hardware has changed at the mounting points for the cable. It has also improved. I just installed and tested this for my application, and it pulls and releases my e-brake with ease."
4,Romeo and Juliet for Young People,"An alternative to the same old Romeo and Juliet for young people! Certain classes seem to dive into Shakespeare, while others drift over him, never really sure what his most famous tragedy is truly about. This comic/manga version, is a useful tool for students struggling with the reading of Shakespeare's language, making the play accessible while still requiring the student to read key passages. The pictures capture the student's attention and often times get the hesitant student to read what they normally wouldn't. I used this version to teach last year and was amazed at the response! Very helpful and well done!"
5,Star Chaser lighted cat toy,A wonderful toy I would highly recommend. Once the cat realizes he cannot get the ball out of the track it drives him nuts trying. All my cats at one time or another try this toy and play with it often. The ball flashes while it is rolling creating an even more enticing playtime.
3,"Lasted for From Oct. 20, 2008 until Nov. 12, 2008.:(",I got the one box of Somat for $18.94 on 10-20-2008...was able to put the whole box into the Water Softener. I live in Fort Lauderdale and we have hard water...76/4.4 grains...with the Selector Position set to MED I only got 30 to 35 washes out of one box...this is going to be an expensive habit that I can not afford...I need to find a more economical way of finding the Special Salt...Help Me!
4,necessary for miele,"Well, the instructions for my Miele dishwasher were very specific: Fill the salt container with dishwasher salt. Without the salt, the dishes come out with a strange smell. Each box lasts about 2-3 months (we use our dishwasher 2-3 times a week). I know some people who use other salt substitutes, but since I already ponied up $2000 for my dishwasher, a few extra bucks for Somat seems worth it if it can prolong the life of my machine."
1,Product needs a detailed description before I buy it.,"The sleeve is listed with ID (interior diameter) numbers. I need OD (outside diameter) measurements (Duh..the sleeves fits on the outside, not the inside). ID numbers do absolutely no good. The Spectre products might be good, but I will never know if I can't get decent descriptions of their products. What a way NOT to run a company. A complete description, plus how to install, how not to install and potential installation pitfalls should be included on all Spectre products."
2,poor quality,"I bought two of these to organize my spices and am disappointed. They don't spin well when empty or full and they feel flimsy, especially compared to the OXO good grips turntables that I have. These will be going in the trash."
1,Does not Turn at all,"I bought it because this item was the only double turn-table for this size. However, the table does not turn smoothly at all. So, it should be OK to use just as a shelf, but you can hardly reach to the rear side of this table."
1,Need to go back to old design,"This turntable does not turn-as you attempt to make it turn, it slides across the shelf. The supports are now rectangular instead of the once thinner, round supports. It might be easier to assemble (and cheaper to make) but easy and cheap just doesn't work or appeal to me. Spend a little more and get something that works if you plan on using it more than a few months as this is a throw-away. Really disappointed, Rubbermaid!"
1,Poor Design,"I purchased this product to replace my spice rack lazy susan that I have had for over 20 years. The poor design doesn't allow for the turntable to work properly, I would not recommend this product."
5,Best Seller's Bound,"What a great storyline! I was impressed. It makes one think if this could really happen. I would recommend this novel to anyone looking for some excitement from fiction. ""1-4-3 Means I Love You"" will be on the best-seller's list within a matter of days. Jon Ballard has exceptional literary skills."
3,"Enticing photos, but too contrived","The photos are nice, but I found that they didn't resonate the true aura of bondage. i didn't get a feeling that the ladies were really into it, and that their bondage felt real. Instead, it felt a bit staged. And in the end, yes, they are staged, but I wish the photographer would have been able to present to the viewer at least some of the feelings and the general emotion a sub feels while tied up.Also, I was expecting a bigger book (in size of pages) although that was my mistake - it gives the dimensions on amazon."
5,"""Art of Rope"", an artists take on s&m","This book is a masterpiece! Edward Lee sheds new light on the underground world of bondage and S&M by presenting just the right blend of art and erotica to make this book sensual yet tasteful. A coffee table book for the alternative crowd, it features well-known bondage models such as Elkie Cooper and Julie Simone, as well as a host of other beauties. This book is a must-have for anyone interested in or fascinated by the world of BDSM."
2,Not what I expected,Do not order this book if you want to learn rope bondage. It is full of posed pictures with no instructional information.
2,Well-executed photographs of pooly-executed content,"A more appropriate title would be Erotic Bondage: The Art of Bondage. A very significant portion of the photos don't have any rope in them, and most of the photos that do involve rope are very lackluster. Ties are very simple, sometimes sloppy. Certainly not what was expected from a book that claims ""Art of Rope.""From a technical standpoint the photos are very well done. From a content perspective, the book never gets off the ground. Edward Lee certainly knows his way around a camera; how he just needs to expand his knowledge of artistic rope bondage."
3,Too personal to apply,"As a middle school teacher who focueses heavily on writing family history, I bought this book in hopes it would help guide me toward new exercises with my students.In general, that mission was accomplished, but the rest of the book was heavy with references to the author's own family.There were very few ""generic"" exercises that could apply to any student without having to photocopy half the book so kids would have an idea as to what the author was referring to.In that sense, the book was a great disappointment. I'm glad I purchased it, but I would not go back and buy it for the amount I did. (I'd spend five bucks, tops.)"
5,A MUST-READ for the newly initiated TS family.,"Mrs. Shimberg's candor and very readable style make you feel like you're not alone (and you're not!). A very wonderful treatment of a malady that is another aspect of the ""human condition."" Relax with this book and learn how to ""flow with the go."""
3,Careful with this one,"There are many helpful items in this book. But my one complaint is it is written by the mother of touretters. She is not a sufferer herself. Shimberg strays from the subject all too often and much of the book reads like a parent's manual for rearing any type of child. I am glad I read this book as a sufferer of tourrette syndrome but one must be aware that it is geared toward parents and teachers, not adults living with tourette syndrome."
3,helpful,i plan to become a special ed teacher to work with tourettes kids and other this was a very infortive book. i liked thAT THE AUTHOR HAD EXPIERNCE WITith tourette and was not just someone that had reasearch it and then wrote a book.
4,A Good Workout for the Imagination,I enjoyed the concept of the world that exists somewhere between the edge of reality and a magical world that evokes a time from years past. The book manages to tread this line and cross it from time to time throughout the course of the book without too much trouble. Mr. Rohan's writing is a good workout for the imagination and fills the mind with vivid imagery. A good book about a man that escapes his reality for a trip in a fantasy world where he's the hero and let's you come along for the ride. Worth the extra effort to try find this one. I'm ordering the sequel myself as soon as I'm done writing this.
4,Very good,"Well written, easy to read...the pages fly by. My only complaint is the total lack of photographs"
3,silent rage,"i was disapointed that there were no pictures in the book. i also felt that more detail should have gone in the ending such as last meal, who attended the execution, and interviews with families of the victims"
3,Not what is advertized,"I spend a lot of time on the road and I use a lot of different types of printers. The HP is over priced for what you get. Keeping in mind you can buy a pretty nice printer for $300 today. It is much slower that advertized at 9 PPM black. It is more like 1 minute per page. That is with 30% text on a page. This is NOT good. The duplex printing requires one to manually flip the pages over. What is up with that? Print quality is good. Portability is OK, but not as nice as the Cannon i70. Ink cartridge size is good, but expensive. Infrared printing is glitchy. Quality and syle is OK. Unfortunately when a company tags a printer as a portable then the price goes up by a multiple of 200%. This is a mediocre printer that is worth about $50.00."
1,Don't buy an HP 450,"I absolutely loved the printer HP 450 when it was working, perfect printing. After a while the paper gets jammed and then it gradually stops working. I tried to get it repaired - still didn't work. Then I looked on the internet and there are lots of people saying the same as me. The paper feed gets jammed its all very frustrating.So I have purchased CanoniP90 from Amazon it's good but not as good as as the HP when it worked well."
1,Ridiculous Waste of Art Supplies..,"Boring.Cheap.It makes no sense.Skip this mess, its not worth the effort.."
4,readable and concise,"Complete well organized text. Very readable with the exception of the sections on MRI physics (a little too much ""high-level"", mathematical physics for the everyday neuroradiologist). Good quality images and pathological correlation. Overall, very good reference text that is not too overly and unnecessarily encyclopedic and exhausting to read."
4,"Peaceful crane by nature, powerful warrior when provoked","When I first received Smokescreen I was a little disappointed, as most of the Armada toys had nifty features and lots of weaponry. Smokescreen didn't even come with a gun! But boy was I amazed when I discovered what featured his mini-con unlocked. His long crane actually conceals a HUGE! missile launcher which extends to about twice the length of the crane.Smokescreen is a heroic character in the cartoon series, and a really fun toy. It'd be a shame if he were overlooked because of his initial appearance - while Smokescreen is peace-loving, he can defend his Autobot comrades just as well as any other Cybertron warrior."
4,One of the decent toys of Armada,I like this toy and I'd like to say I haven't been to pleased with Armada with the lack of articulation or the cheesy gimicks.I would like to point out that smokescreen can actually stand when his crane is out all the way.Pros:-a gimmick that actually looks and works well.-a good looking vechile mode and robot mode-the basic points of articulation that I think toys should have (except knees)Cons:-no knees: I feel a toy should be able to sit downI would like to say that while it has no knees it's not a huge issue for me while normally it would be - it's not much of an issue for this toy since he's kinda stumpy anyhow.I'd recomend this toy.
2,The most disappointing Supercon,"With so many incredible Supercons on the shelf, Smokescreen here just doesn't stack up to the other bots. His vehicle mode is ok, and greatly enhanced by the fact that his boom crane converts to a massive missile launcher. His bot mode, on the other hand, is short, dumpy and ill-proportioned. His working winch is a nice idea in his vehicle mode, but it looks plain ugly on his bot mode's chest. To make matters worse, the massive crane just hangs off his shoulder and makes him very difficult to stand. It seems like it would have been easy enough to get this piece of kibble out of the way. The package is helped along by Liftor, who is an excellent Minicon. If you're going to get him... save him for last. There are tons of him on the shelves, so you aren't likely to miss out."
3,Great toy,"Smokescreen is a pretty good transformer. It easily transforms and is very durable. The only thing that I don't like about it is that they screwed up the head when you turn it. Except for that, this is a good toy to have. I recommomend getting other transformers such as Optimus, Galvatron and those other big guys. Well, that's all I gt to say."
5,Beautiful Book,"This book has alot of realy nice pictures and story. It's very beautifully done. I bought it for my father in law and he loved it. He said he had another John Wayne book but, this one was much nicer. I recieved it quickly. The book jacket was crinkled and the seller said I could exchange it after I gave it to my father in law. But my father in law said he could fix it so there was no need to do so. I would highly recomend this book to any John Wayne or western lover. Great coffee table book or addition to any personal library."
3,A NEAR HIT,"BEING AN AVID JOHN WAYNE FAN I AM COMPELLED TO KEEP THIS BOOK IN SPITE OF THE HAPHAZARD PRESENTATION OF HIS CAREER. THE QUALITY OF PAPER,PICTURES,AND PRINTING WERE EXCELLENT. IN MY OPINION THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN PRESENTED IN THE ORDER THEY OCCURRED.YOURS TRULY, ROBERT L. JORDAN"
5,John Wayne there rode a legend,I bought this for my father for a Christmas gift. He loves it the best book he has read on John Wayne! He is a die hard John fan!
4,1950's alive in your home,"We bought two Santas and two Pacconi christmas trees when they were on a steep discount at Amazon--they were the best gifts we gave, immediate hits with each couple, one in their late 50's, one in the mid-20's. In each case the response was the same: ""It's like my childhood; they are going in the living room each season.""Vivid but soft, these are superb decorations."
5,Worthwhile Social Psych Textbook,"This book was one of the required text books in a Social Psychology class I took. The requirement was only a selection of experiments, but because of the interesting collection, and the supurb organization I read the entire book. Very worthwhile!"
4,good gift for pre-teen,"delicate and simply crafted, was a great gift for my 11 year old. its thin, and the charms are not exactly made from the finest craftsman ship...it still is a good buy for the money and was a great casual gift for a little girl."
2,"Works, but little to no support for making it work!","After creating my first podcast using this program and going through a couple hoops to even get the upgrade for it, I went and bought another program with more options. I hated to waste the $40 on this program but there wasn't much I could really do when this was so glitchy when putting sound clips together. Not only that, but there was no support, and options, for the ITunes tags in the rss file. When I couldn't get this file uploaded the first time, I tried going to the website for help, and found NOTHING of use. They give you the option to contact them is all. I managed to get my files ready, but it took about an hour more than I wanted it to.If I were you, I'd buy something else if you're looking for an all-in-one program for podcasting."

5,Simply A Must Buy for Grey Bumpers,"""After going through all the reviews I bought this awesome product. I just bought a used car and the bumpers of the car had turned grey. Gave this black magic a try and boom it worked flawlessly for me. One thing I want to make sure is that while applying the dye please wait for it to dry so that you know the exact darkness of black that you want to see on your car. Highly recommend this."""
4,"Good, But...","The finished result is much better than before. My only complaint is that the cleaner they give you to clean off previous silicone dressings isn't quite strong enough. I used Mother's ""Back to black"" for about a year and kept having to re-apply it every time it rained. I wanted something more permanent, so I bought this product. However, even after scrubbing the trim for about 10 minutes with the solution, when I began applying the ink, it began to bead up on the trim instead of absorbing in. After repeated coats of the ink (like 8) it finally set in and and now it looks great. But my advice to anyone who used any silicone based products such as ""back to black"" previously , is to use a stronger cleaner than what they give you, to ensure the trim is really clean before applying the ink."
1,Avoid this stuff like the Plague,"After my experience with this product, I will NEVER again trust Amazon feedback ratings again. This stuff is the worst. I spent an hour applying and the next three hours trying to remove it. The Amazon Ad says it will not stick to your cars paint. Oh YES IT DOES stick to paint. There are no instructions. None. Had I known it was going to stick to the paint, I would have masked off painted areas. I had to use a Scotch pad to remove it. Nothing else would work. Wound up scratching the paint on my car. But I had no choice. It was either scratched paint of drip runs of this stuff all over my car. An absolute nightmare. Do not buy this product. ( FYI: I also noticed some of the so-called customers pics on the Amazon ad were the same pics on the product's box)"
4,It does what it says,Well if you desperately need to dye something black than this is probably your best choice. I wouldn't use this on something that is only a little bit faded as it is very messy and can leave streaks if you are not very very precise when putting it on. I have a black car from 2000 and used it to restore some of the pieces on the exterior that had faded dramatically to the point where they looked grey. It worked for its purpose.Not really sure of any other options in restoring faded pieces back to original look so I would have to recommend this to anyone that would like to get it back to some what new look.
2,4 coats and still looks awful,I used this product as instructed and after the first coat I was shocked at how awful it streaked. Three more coats and it looks a little better but still has streaks and still looks awful. I think I will have to have the bumper professionally repainted. The bumper looked bad before but now it looks like a hot mess. It was used on a 2001 Nissan Xterra.
5,Works as Advertised,"This stuff is fantastic. Reconditioned black trim on 1998 BMW. 15 year old plastic looks like new. If it streaks, put some more on. It's black. If you were unsure or had doubts about buying this stuff like I did, just buy it. It works."
5,forever black is the best i ever used for black plastic and tires,i have a 1985 corvette and it has a black bumper strip at the belt line and it was faded bad and the door handles and they are aluminum with a black finish i put it on the tires too i put forever black on and it looks brand new i put it on 5 years ago and it still looks like it did the day i put it on i recomend it to everyone i know now and they love forever black im a car guy i have 7 cars i put forever black on all the tires so i dont have to put tire black on them i hate getting over spray on the rims and if you take off all the tire black gets on the body now i wish they made it for gray plastic i have a 2002 avalanche its a pain putting trim shine on the plastic every month
3,Miracle product,Works as advertised. Would recommend using a foam paint brush to apply and putting on two coats. Trim looks darker then factory new. Not glossy or fake looking. Fantastic product
5,great stuff,This stuff worked great on my 01 xterra. It doesn't wash off either and seems like it will last a while. Just be sure to put it on very evenly because it will look very bad and streaky if you don't take your time.
3,It made the black parts black again!,"This product wasn't the exact one I thought it was, but I went ahead and used it anyway. I put 3 coats on my Dodge Ram, and it looks great from a distance of about 3-4 feet, but when you get closer, you can see darker/lighter spots, brush marks, etc. It didn't seem to get much better from the 2nd coat to the 3rd coat, so I stopped there. I didn't use the bottle applicator, but followed suggestions from other buyers to use a foam brush to apply, which is the way to go."
5,The ONLY PRODUCT that DELIVERS!,READ all the reviews - the tips are amazing - when I followed what other people wrote - I had an amazing successful experience. I have a HONDA ELEMENT (05) and I did EVERYTHING that was BLACK - and that means the entire lower part of the vehicle. It not only looks like NEW - but I can't stop looking at it. It has stayed on (now 2 months) - and it looks natural (not shiny). Please remember to TAKE YOUR TIME - I did one area a day - so that makes it easier to do an excellent job. A few times I had to go back over places when I saw small streaks - sometimes I used the larger foam throw away brushes. I even did my windshield wipers. I got so hooked on the look - that I couldn't stop. Clean well and let dry first. If you've got the patience - you'll have a beautiful look. PROMISE!
4,Can't complain,"The prep work was easy enough, nothing to strenuous. It handled the trim around my windows very well. I used the original applicator pad at first, but then after reading other reviews, I decided to take their advice and buy little foam brushes, and it worked much better. There were certain parts of my trim that were not so porous and in these pieces of trim smearing was a bit of an issue. After a second and third coat it looked a lot better, but still not completely smooth. Overall I would say I'm happy with it. Given the price and how easy it is to apply, I can overlook the fact that it has limitations when it comes to certain types of trim."
2,STREAKY,"This stuff is really streaky, even after multiple coats. It also runs easily and foams very easily. Does not last that long either. A bird crapped on the stuff a few days after I applied it and it completely removed the dye in the exact shape of the bird crap. Awesome. It works below average but seems to have some potential if the formula was adjusted."
2,Didn't like it,"The product wasn't really that good after while the paint start falling off, I repainted but still seeing the paint falling from the bumpers."
1,Don't waste your money,"I used this on the faded black door handles of a 2007 silverado truck. It went on and looked ok. It tended to run,so keep a clean cloth handy to wipe up the spills. After a car wash and a week or so in the hot sun, the fading began to reappear and the handles needed another application. If you are looking for something more permanent try a trim dye kit such as forever black. If you want something only temporary, you would be better off saving yourself some money and trying something containing peanut oil or simply armor all protectant."
1,Bad product and worse design,I wanted to darken the plastic trim on my 2006 Xterra and this product seemed to fit the bill. And it does darken the trim as long as you are looking from a passing car at 60 mph. Up close it is full of streaks and blotches. As bad as that is the design of the applicator is worse. You have to push it against the areawhich wish to treat but if that area is on the side of the car where most trim is then it run down in a black river all over the paint. RUnined a perfectly good towel in wiping it off before it dried.
4,Good purchase,Arrived very quickly. My bumpers were no longer black and it has restored them to black. I would suggest masking paint where being applied as well as applying heavy. I need to do touch up in areas but it looks great. I have a jeep I bought used and it no longer looks used!!!!! Going to recommend this to my buddy for his avalanche as well.Also the small trim sponge paint brushes for painting the home helped in a lot of areas. Againg clean well and let dry completely and apply heavy. Looks good in an hour great in a day.
1,This product sucked,I followed the directions completely and this stuff has left streaks and spots on my bumper that I can't rub out or wash off. It does not go on as smooth as the product leads you to believe and the coverage is horrible
1,more like shoe polish,"I put this on the panel that is under my windshield wipers, a vinyl part. It went on poorly and you can scratch it off with your fingernail. Does not revitalize your rubber/plastic/vinyl, gives it a shoe polish look."
1,Forever black dye kit,Got the product fast well package but the item did not work as promise i use the item as directed and did not work all i got from it was a black water like that only run down to the trim staining my car paint and my floor did not work at all maybe the product that i got was a defected one i don't know but for me it did not work at all the product is like shoe shine wax bottle dye.
4,Works well,"This did make my car and suv look a lot better. It is not perfect (it takes a few coats), but is a lot better than leaving the plastic areas looking like crap from the damage of the sun. It's not bad at all."
1,Potential rootkit installer with this CD,"Apologies that I'm not commenting on the music, but buyer beware. This EMI CD displayed the following message when I tried to copy it to the music library on my hard disk:""To listen to the CD a number of files need to be updated on your PC.""As another commentator on another EMI CD wrote: ""From the research I was able to do on the Internet, this is a rootkit which is attempting to install. It is what Sony got in trouble for at one time.""I believe that commentator was correct. These rootkits have big security and performance implications. At least the Sony one caused serious performance slow down, and was very difficult for a non-expert to uninstall. So I do not recommend ever agreeing to ""update a number of files"". That's an innocent term for a very harmful practice.It's a sad state of affairs that I cannot listen to this on my computer even though I paid for a legitimate CD."
2,Blair fans BEWARE,"Being a major Linda Blair fan, when I saw that she was credited with being in this movie I went ahead and purchased it. Bad move. The extent of Blairs performance is a black and white inset photo as Carrie Fisher tells the audience how she is sometimes mistaken for Linda. THAT'S IT !The movie itself isn't bad, just not the sort of movie one would watch over again, hence negating the need for purchase. The whole movie has an admirable student film feel about it, and has some surprising cameo's, and the performances by the leads are quite good, showing promise.There are no extra's on the DVD release, and my biggest piece of advice is ""Try before you buy"". Go out and rent this movie first !"
4,The best of the same,"Amr Diab does not waste any time and starts this album with Habibi (Ya Nour El Ain), the greatest hit in recent Middle East memory; its infectious rhythm and melody will put a hook into your brain good and firm once you hear it. The second song, Amarain, possibly my favourite on this album, is sort of the same thing... and so is the rest of the album. While newcomers to Arabic pop may find the whole lot exotic enough, for me it began to feel repetative enough after few songs. Khaled's contribution on the third track is cool but the whole song is uneven- his voice is way too good to be used in such a ditty. Overall, this is a good collection of Amr's songs, but not more than this. Western ears may need to adjust to the quarter tones scale and the sound of the strings, but it is well worth it. And once you're ready for a close to perfect album of this type of music, check out Mandam Aleyk by Nawal el-Zoghbi."
5,"Trucks and Tractors, Oh My!","This DVD has four great episodes that feature Bob the Builder and his friends. Each episode has some great lessons in it, including teamwork and following directions. My boys have watched this DVD numerous times and love it! There are also tractors and trucks which my boys go crazy for!"
1,this product is pointless,Ok you shouldn't by this product or anything like it. This is most likely knitted and you could do this your self for the price of the yarn and a pair of 2 dollar knitting needles. It would be easy so don't by this!!!!
2,"Poorly written, uninteresting","This book contains so many misspellings, poor grammar, and misuse of words that it is difficult to read. It is described as the history of a Black family, from slavery to the modern era, and reads like a teenager's version of events, juiced up with enough sex and violence to sell. I kept asking myself why anyone would want to provide a detailed account of her ancestors' illegal activities, infidelities, and sexual exploits....... It was free, and I got what I paid for. I don't recommend it."
5,Great read!!!,"Kim Robinson has done a wonderful job compiling her family's history in The Roux in the Gumbo. The events are well organized, her characters well described. The reader definitely gets to know Kim's family. You'll take an emotional rollercoaster ride reading this one! I was especially impressed with the diligence of all of her family...and the clear message is to not ever give up! I'm sure everyone who reads this book will be reminded of a ""Mother"" in his or her own life. I enjoyed this book very much, and look forward to reading more from this author."
3,moslys visual guide to massage essentials,Great book for massage beginners. Has a help section to do massage on yourself.
2,Full of information; drier than sand,"Yes, the information itself is great, but the presentation is awful. Very dry writing, huge paragraphs, rambling, and, sometimes, simply TOO MUCH information. Very difficult to read and get through."
2,Miserable writing and poor factual presentation,"I am at a loss to explain the five-star reviews of this book. It is one of the most poorly written history books I have ever read. Sentences and facts are constantly qualified, as if the author is afraid to state a fact or opinion. The thoughts and flow are poorly organized, which the author attempts to correct by using long compound sentences. Frequent reference is made to other works with nothing more, like ""the Slavs ate green cheese, although some of it wasn't green and one must consider the arguments of Miakovsky in that regard"".I was very excited to get a history of Russia, especially concerning the earlier periods, as I enjoy reading history and had just finished a good work on medieval Europe (@400 AD - 1200 AD). I really wanted to follow the connected tribal migrations and religious history to the east for the same period.I was sorely disappointed in my purchase and put it down after 100 pages. I suggest you look elsewhere for Russian history."
1,Mine lasted about five Minutes,"Ok, after about 5 minutes of use the first rock that I encountered broke it into about 5 pieces. Nowhere near as strong as a steel trowel."
3,Okay trowel,"This is 1 dollar at Walmart. I would not have spent more than that on it. That said, it has lasted where a more expensive three dollar Walmart metal fiskars trowel has broken into bits.. I am currently searching for a stronger trowel. This one is simply not broken because when it is under stress it bends slightly, letting you know to stop."
4,to expensive,"its a good product but a week after i bought this on amazon i saw the same tool at home depot for .99 cents. could have saved some money, live and learn."
1,"junk,sorry,my very first transplant,put the trowel in the ground,snap","this trowel stinks.It broke my very first transplant.Stick w/the old time steel ones if u can find them,my rating would be zero stars if it allowed it.paita"
4,Composite Trowel,This makes a lot of sense. How many times have you gotten something made of ferrous metal and have it just corrode and rust away in the shed. This little guy never rusts and will be as good as new many years down the road.
2,Not durable,Pretty cheap material. The composite blade isn't strong or durable. It cracked the first time it encountered any resistance and then it snapped in half. I should have just gotten a metal trowel.
3,ole lady in CO,This trowel is nice and light so when I pot a house plantI don't turn the bag of soil up make a mess... Nice
5,Just what I was looking for .....,"Really thrilled with this product ....I'd used both the Canon BJC 55 & 85 before and been constantly frustrated. The HP is much more 'solid', great design, yet small and compact. Best of all the print quality is superb - much higher res than the other models on the market, and the colours come out looking great. Sheet feeding is good ....no 'catcher'so you have to give it enough space. But overall, for those with limited space, who want the option to travel, but who want to produce good looking results - its a great buy."
2,Paper Feed,"I can echo the comments re the paper feed. I've been using the 450 since December 2004, and it worked great at first. Especially pleasing was the wireless bluetooth connection to my iPAQ. But, as others have indicated there is a problem with paper jams and feed in general. Sometimes it thinks it's out of paper when there are 4-5 sheets still in the tray. Lately, even though I've cleaned the cartridges, it has been dropping large ink blotches on the print-outs that I can get to feed. Frustrating! Had real possibilities..."
2,PAPER WON'T FEED,"I have now owned 2 of these printers and I thought they were very good at first. However, after a couple of months I started experiencing paper feed problems. The printer just won't grab the paper. You have to try all sorts of paper amounts in the feeder before you come up with a proper thickness where it grabs. My patience has run out on this second printer and I will go back to the Canon."
2,Frustrating,"It's a shame I have to give a low rating for this printer because I really had high hopes for it. And I thought since HP was (at one time) well-known for printers & since the price for this particular compact one was quite high that it would be good to go. Unfortunately I didn't realize how bad it was until it was too late to return it (& I bought it at Circuit City which is now gone). The main problem is the paper jamming, even with 1 page inserted, & that makes you have to readjust it, press the button, readjust...over & over & over. And I don't usually print a large number of pages (which is a good thing), but even when I do print out multiple pages it will still jam. Very annoying. I see a new compact HP model D1660 out now--it doesn't seem to be doing much better. Probably better to get a 3-in-1 type printer. Buyer beware--always read the Amazon reviews on ANY product FIRST! What happened to this HP company anyway?"
2,Very Frustrated!,It's just like everyone else has said. This printer worked great for about a year of limited use and then the paper jams started. It would not take card stock or other heavy weighed papers. I have to constantly push the paper in to get it to feed. I absolutely loved this printer at first and thought of getting another one just like it but after seeing these reviews--no way!!!
3,Average purchase,This is adequate for what I am needing it for. It was missing a battery and some other things but it's probably my fault for not reading it more thoroughly.It works and works fine once I got the missing things.
1,very disappointing product,"This product was a huge disappointment. First, it was not what it was represented to be: cow print was only on the front surfaces, and the remainder was cheap black stretch fabric of some kind. The seatcovers arrived in dusty, dirty boxes, and were soiled badly. One actually had a greasy, dirty footprint on the front! Attachment parts were missing, too.Pitiful product, and I can't imagine what the vendor was thinking when they sent out a product in dirty, unusable condition. They went right back to the vendor.Amazon did promptly refund my money, however. That was a good thing."
4,Excellent reference for beginners in M&A,"Easy to use reference, it helped me get the answer instantly."
1,Very dated material,"The Q&A approach adopted in this book is very useful. It would provide for a very useful reference manual on M&A if its content were not so dated. Its discussion of taxes, accounting, and deal structures does not reflect recent changes in rules and M&A practices. It would be helpful if the author would update the material. Other more current and more comprehensive books on the subject that I have found useful include Mergers, Acquisitions, and Other Restructuring activities by Depamphilis and Bruner's M&A book."
3,Ambivalent about this one...,"I think I had to spend too much time using my imagination to fill in spots Mr. Forbes left in his story-telling and smoothing over surface inconsistencies. He didn't draw many pictures for me, I had to do much of it myself.On the other hand, the story was gripping, fascinating - I got quite a bit of enjoyment out of racing virtually across the European continent with Newman, Tweed and the gang.I'd recommend for light-to-medium reading."
2,Lacking Content,"This is not a review book at all, but a collection of problems from the different topics covered under the civil examination. If you are interested in solving problems and being able to see the solution line by line, then I would recommend this book. However, for anyone who really needs to review the civil material, do not purchase this. For what it offers, this book is also overpriced at approximately $40."
3,Better than nothing....,"Ok, I agree with the other reviews that this book is very incomplete and shallow. If you have not learned many of the civi topics than this book is not for you. It will not teach you how to solve civil problems. I am still in school and this book was just what I needed to gain a basic review of already familiar civil topics. Also, I would never buy this book unless it was 10 dollars or less. I found someone to borrow it from. The book is thin! You can get all the way through it in a few hours!"
3,Small and needs more,"This book has fewer examples than actually needed, some solutions should have more explanation, you need to use the NCEES handbook along with it to understand the solutions, I do not know why the Author did not specify references and manuals needed to accompany the study of this book."
4,Dalgliesh looks on,"Some vacation ... Superintendent Adam Dalgliesh drives to his aunts in Suffolk with hope of rest and reflection on his own life. Soon he finds himself in the middle of it, with local inspector Reckless investigating the murder (or natural causes?) of a Maurice Seton, floating on a dinghy alone with his hands cut off, possibly by his aunt's hatchet. From here the mystery starts, and continues from a literary circle, to a strip tease artist. The conclusion was a shocker for me, although looking back, the clues and the character development fit! For the American birdwatcher, like myself, there is also delight in aunt Jane's identification of the curlew sandpiper, versus Adam's dunlin."
2,Not her best book,"Although the (logical) resolution to the Deborah subplot from the previous three books is quite welcome, the rest of this book is pretty substandard. The method of murder is ridiculously elaborate, and the murderer's ten-page confession is incredibly unbelievable. But Jane Dagliesh was a wonderful character, and deserved to be brought back in the later part of the series."
2,This One Was A Disappointment !,"I've recently discovered P.D.James (WHERE HAVE I BEEN? ), and I really enjoyed her other books.This one was a bomb. It has a convoluted plot, which in itself is not the worst thing, but none of the characters were the least bit likable (with the possible exception of Jane Dalgliesh), and I was hoping they'd all get murdered by the end of the book. I found the book difficult to finish, and the ending a letdown (a ten page taped confession! ) The book started out well - a body, with its hands cut off, floats to shore in a boat, and there are plenty of local suspects. I guessed the murderer right off the bat (it was the character I liked the least), so the final solution was no surprise - just a long time coming. P.D.James is a great writer, though, so I'll excuse this one clunker."
3,vaguely disappointed,"Mainly, it was the enigmatic, controversial Stan The Man Kenton I wanted to know more about. Didn't happen. Lots of name-dropping; but rather cold, all told."
2,Frustrating,"I am not new to step aerobics so I did not think following along with the instructor would be a problem. However, I was very wrong. She does not do a good job at explaining upcoming steps or even showing them in slow motion prior to working them into the routine. I gave this video 2 stars because I did enjoy the 'pump' section of the video."
3,Not enough instruction,"I haven't done step aerobics in years. So I am somewhat a loss when this video starts out with no review of the basic steps. I'm sure with time I'll get the hang of it but for now I am not getting the full work-out as I try to remember what ""L-step,"" ""over the top"", etc. means."
3,It's okay,"I think I just expected it to be a little more fun, but over all it's a good workout video."
4,I like this a lot!,This exercise DVD is a bargain in my opinion. It's a good workout that's not too complicated and gives you an all-around workout of all muscle groups.
3,hard to follow,I was very excited to get this product but when I attempted to use it I found it a bit difficult to do.
5,Best computer I've ever owned,This is my 11th computer and the best one I've ever owned. It's also the first one I've been excited to use in years. I can't recommend it highly enough.
1,The CD R/W is too slow,The 4x write on the CDR means it takes over 20 minute to create a CD! The standard these days on a entry level product like this is 16x. And because the CPU is so slow you can't do anything while it is creating the CD. I was not impressed.
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"I suppose I expected more from this book. After reading the introduction by editor Thomas Morris, I was expecting what he termed biographical essays ""from the heart"". Indeed there were several insightful essays from this slant discussing people's life experiences as they mingled reason and faith. Most of this book, however, was extremely disappointing to me. I found many authors drudging on regarding points that strayed very far from the stated ""thesis"" of the book and many of the essays were rehashings of the other essays in the book.I really struggled to find the motivation to finish this book and that is quite a strong statement coming from me."
3,Of God and the Philosophers,"This is not a bad book, but is not at all what we expected it to be. Most of the philosophers, whose essays are included, were such confirmed Christians in their early days that it is almost a given that they resumed their original life view after straying slightly afield for a while. We were hoping for stories of well known philosophers who moved from confirmed agnosticism or atheism to a firm belief in God, inspiring tales richly peppered with explanations of how and why they came to experience their transformations."
3,Mixed Bag,"This collection of essays is a mixed bag of good and not so good. Several of the authors obviously cling to Christianity because they grew up in it, have had a favourable experience with it and enjoy the sense of community that it brings. But these kinds of reasons could apply to any number of social organizations created by man.I agree that one of the better essays is by Peter van Inwagen. I am troubled somewhat by his remark on p.37 ""Nowadays I would say that I don't expect that the New Testament always gives an exact account of Jesus' words......."". (This comment was in reference to the Parousia (the second coming of Jesus)). So how exactly are we to know which words attributed to Jesus are authentic? If, on major points like this Sciprture is not demonstrably reliable then why believe any of it?"
2,Disappointing,"Weak philosophical analysis. I expected much more thoughtful discourse. All I found was ""I believe, so there""."
5,Amazing,Fascinating. Hearing this makes JB's tragic death even more so.Where would Coil have gone next?
2,Too Tight,"I ordered this shoe and thought it would fit. Nine West shoes used to be true to size. However, the peep-toe area makes the shoe extremely uncomfortable, therefore you will need a larger size not to have your toes squeezed into the small opening. Also- the edging is GOLD not white, as it appears in the picture."
4,show stopper,"i ordered this shoe in fuschia and i love it. it is a little wide, but i get a lot of complements."
1,Bo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ring!,"This book moves SO slowly. The whole thing could be fit into a book half the length. Steve Berry's writing style is repetitive, long winded and, frankly, boring."
1,Editor please!,"Who is this author? Who is his editor? It has been a long time since i have read anything this poorly plotted, written, and edited. Trite? Yes! Contrived? Oy vey! And the dialog... Who speaks like this? I hope the author considers asking a trusted friend for a read through and honest critique for future mqnuscripts."
2,I'm only up to Chapter Twelve,"...and wish it was over, already. The subject is pretty interesting, but this book leaves a lot to be desired. I could give a [...] about the characters and the writing! Oy vey.Please let me give but one example of a bit that grates upon my nerves:""...though the Muslims were defeated, their lands confiscated, their cities occupied, they'd not be vanquished."" (p. 60)It's really not the sentence itself grating upon my nerves; rather, it is the use of contractions, i.e. ""they'd not be."" Normally, this doesn't bother me, but when it seems a constant pattern of writing, it becomes contrived and affected.And annoying. Really annoying.And it does seem constant, but I'm not able (HA!) to find any of the other numerous examples I've found."
2,Formulaic Adventure,"If you've seen National Treasure, Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade, and read The DaVinci Code, then you can skip this book because you've seen/read it already.Greedy, ambitious villain who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Check.Mysterious Woman. Check.Hidden Treasure. Check.Templar Knights. Check.Retired spy dragged into adventure against his better judgment. Check.All the basic checkmarks are there for a formulaic adventure novel, but there is absolutely nothing at all that raises this beyond being predictable and pedestrian. No humour, limited mystery, few cliffhangers and characters that are just barely interesting. Even worse, the historical characters are presented in a way that keeps them from being memorable. As they are referenced in the novel, it becomes a bit of a slog to remember who they were (and why I should care). This has been done before many times and certainly there are better options out there in this genre."
2,Ho hum!,"Dan Brown's DA VINCI CODE did it first and, most definitely, did it best! Now the genre is overcrowded with wannabes, copycots and third-rate knock-offs! I'll keep this review short and sweet. If I hadn't read THE DA VINCI CODE several years ago, I might have enjoyed this one to the tune of 3 stars. As it is, I found it tedious, plodding, derivative and little more entertaining than a video game with an endless string of puzzles and undeveloped cardboard characters ... in short, 1 star at best. Since there are probably still a handful of people for whom this might be the first time they've encountered a masons and templars novel, I'll allow it 2 stars.Not particularly recommended.Paul Weiss"
2,Excruciating...,"I read this book a few months after reading Berry's ""The Third Secret"", which I enjoyed and gave a highly-rated review. Unfortunately, this book was nowhere near as enjoyable. I had to force my way through it after stopping a half-dozen times.Characters were inconsistent, exposition was superfluous, and the pacing was erratic. ""Templar Legacy"" was as bad as ""Third Secret"" was good.I gave it two stars because I still believe Berry put in much hard work in researching this book and I can appreciate that."
2,"Bloated, boring and bewildering...","This reads like an unedited, poorly planned attempt to make quick money from Da Vinci Code fans. The ""heroes"" are not even all that likeable, the plot is too convoluted and the climax not very credible. I stuck with it to the end, trying to get my money's worth, but by the time it got better I was no longer interested in how it came out. No one expects their historical thrillers to be totally plausible---after all, other than the discovery of King Tut's tomb in the 1920's, what hidden treasure has ever surfaced in the past 80 years? However, this book is full of implausibilities and unneccessary complications. Skip it."
3,"Similar to the Da Vinci Code, but not as exciting","Perhaps cashing in on the success of the Da Vinci Code, the author has written a decent thriller, but one that gets bogged down heavily in the minutea of the mystery to be solved. There are so many (made-up) historical details that supposedly interlock somehow or other, that I just gave up trying to keep track of them. The characters were decent but not terribly interesting or well-developed. I also weary of the basic editing goofs in recent books: Here for example, an antagonist has a ""revolver,"" from which he then fires a one-shot ""burst"" from his ""automatic."" Doesn't anyone read what he wrote any more?"
3,"fun read, silly ending","I'm not going to write an A-Z review--it is well covered by everyone else. I would like to focus just on one point, as I've recently read Dan Brown's Lost Symbol as well as this in quick succession---I'm weary of these inane endings where some stunning revelation is (or is not) made and then no one ever finds out about it. It is beyond belief that so many important things can happen--and then they are just covered up. If you can live with the inevitable ""HUH? You gotta be kidding..."" it is a fun read, and better written than Brown's book. (Berry's book has echoes of the Da Vinci Code rather than Lost Symbol...) But authors who bite off more than they can chew inevitably wind up disappointing in the end. Berry couldn't figure out how to end this; so he just abruptly copped out. If you can live with that, this is a lot of fun."
3,Held my interest...mostly,"I decided to read this book after finishing three really good books in a row, (Pillars of the Earth, Kite Runner, World Without End) and since I am interested in Templar history, religious history and a good book I decided to give this a try. To be honest, the only things keeping me going was the fact that I had no other good reading material and there was just enough suspense to keep me from throwing it away. Yes some parts were interesting, but overall I was not impressed with the quality of writing nor the blatant fiction that is neatly woven into enough facts to make you wonder. It's not all bad, as I did give it three stars, but there are better books out there."
1,terrible writing,"Forget the plot. Forget the questionable facts. Forget the wooden characters and stiff dialog. Forget the terrible copy editing.Forget all that and what remains is terrible writing. Confiscate this man's thesaurus!Here are a couple of excerpts to illustrate my point:""Rennes was clearly not a night place. Bolted doors and shuttered windows lined the way. The restaurant, bookstore, and kiosks were all closed. Darkness sheathed the lane in deep shadow. The wind murmured beyond the walls lke a soul in pain. The scene was like something from Dumas, as if life here spoke only in whispers.""or""They followed her inside and Malone took in the expensive Italian chests, rare armored knights, Spanish torch holders, Beauvais tapestries, and Femish paintings. Everything seemed a cavalcade for the connoisseur.""Maybe it's actually a comedy."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"The ending was so disappointing! I waded through just ""knowing"" that it would get better!! It did NOT. There are too many other great books out there to read one that is a waste of time!!"
2,Seemed to be a DiVinci Code wanna be,"I really wanted to like this book as it was the first book that I've read using the Kindle. Unfortunately, it just wasn't a very engaging story.I don't think that the author necessarily set out to piggy back on the success of Dan Brown's DaVinci Code, but the parallels that this book has to the best seller are pretty uncanny."
3,Okay Novel,"The Templar Legacy has an interesting premise, however it never excited me. There's mystery, historical information and lots of action . The story is flat. I did not care about any of the people in the story and Mark the good ""brother"" didn't seem to possess any kind of spirituality.I was entertained but the novel lacked spice."
4,Templar Legacy,This book was like a rollercoster it had ups with high excitement and quick page turning and then had its downs with slow overly discriptive sections that make you want to stop reading altogether but in the end i really enjoyed it and I look forward to the next one in the series. I just hope that the next is more story less description.
2,Should've been better,"Unfortunately, this book left a lot to be desired. Mediocre character development and almost obsessive overuse of ""big words"", almost to the exclusive point of proving the author can use them. For example, the word ensconse was used 2-3 times in the the course of 2 or 3 chapters, and then dissapeared completely from the author's vocabulary. And who uses the word eidetic in everyday conversation?Perhaps the biggest problem I had w/ the story was how the author conveniently ""forgot"" to reconcile the resolution of the story w/ the well described goal of Cassiopeia Vitt's desire to bring down Christianity. It was an incomplete story.For its good points, the author did develop some suspense and did hold my attention at times. He was able to create a very intricate story line and built-in mystery."
3,Just ok,"This definitely a ""genre book"" - a bit of a clunky attempt to duplicate Dan Brown's writing, almost as if the writer is a fan and decided to give it a try, too. The plot is interesting, although it does meander a LOT with meaningless episodes that don't contribute much to the story. At times it appears that he used the thesaurus on Microsoft Word to edit his writing - for some reason the characters never ""reply"" or ""say"" - they ""make clear"" as in ""It's time to go,"" Malone made clear"" - which is a really weird construct he uses over and over again. But the real problem is that this genre isn't so much writing as describing - the dialogue, pacing, and plot unfolds as if the author is trying to describe a movie rather than write a book. At any rate, its mildly entertaining, but feel free to skip over boring parts to get to the end. As this genre goes this book is amateurish."
4,a great thriller,"Cotton Malone, a retired US undercover operative is now a bookseller in Denmark. He goes to a coffee shop expecting to enjoy a coffee with his ex-supervisor, Stephanie Nelle when he sees a purse snatcher take her purse. He pursues and retrieves the purse and follows the man up a tower, only to have the man jump off the tower and slit his throat on the way down. A bit drastic for a purse snatcher!This sets Cotton off on a mystery to find the secret and treasure of the Templars who were thought to be exterminated in the fourteenth century. Cryptograms, headstones with wrong data and ancient ruins all figure into Berry's mystery. Throw in some really bad guys in the form of rogue Templars who have no problem eliminating people in the way and you have a thriller that is hard to put down.I could see some people getting upset about the questions about Christianity that are posed but I found they made me think about the issues. I thoroughly enjoyed the book."
2,As an avid reader for 14 years...,"I consider it a mark of honor to finish every book I pick up. The only two I can recall putting down without finishing (there have been a few more, but out of thousands read, I can't remember them all) have been Battlefield Earth and this one. Just too many leaps and too little plausibility. Dan Brown created a pseudo-intellectual monster with this sub-genre. Maybe it's time for it to quietly die."
2,A Dan Brown wannabe?,"Maybe it's the first book I read by this author. Maybe I've read too many Dan Brown books, but in all this book is quite slow in all areas: plot, character development and action.The idea is interesting, the mystery of the Templars(Knights who particpated in the crusades and who once held immense source of power up to the 14th century) and their lost treasure.However, I found no sympathy or really interest in the two main characters, Cotton and Stephanie. Maybe it was intentional by the author, but several times I hoped that Stephanie would just die.The action starts out well, but will almost bore you to sleep through the middle, but does pick up although, not fast enough, at the end.If you enjoyed Dan Brown espcially the Da Vinci code, you may be seriously disappointed in this book. Berry tries to emaluate the style and story but comes up well short.Best advice: don't buy it but borrow it from your local library."
2,Not Even Going To Finish It,"Well, my title says it all. I've plowed and plowed through the pages. After 335 pages, it has finally occurred to me that I'm not having fun reading this, don't care if the protagonists survive, and am no longer curious about the mystery of the Great Devise (the big mystery).I think that if you are really, really, really into Templar myth to the point that you don't care if the characters are 3D or not... it's still worthwhile. Steve Berry does do some things right. (And frankly, I know how hard authors work... so I hate to criticize. But... maybe next book will be better.)"
5,Made me want to read more,"This is the first in a series with the main character being Cotton Malone. I thought the book was good, and now I'm on the 4th book in the series."
3,"Ok, but not great","I think the Jesus-was-not-divine-church-conspiracy theory is a bit stale. Moreover, I could not for the life of me figure out why the characters went certain places in the book. Unfortunately, the plot was not captivating enough for me to suspend my disbelief - which for me, it its primary downfall. Also, as far as audio books go, I thought the reader was good and bad at times. Good for accents he provided to certain males characters (American, Danish, and French), but the voices his gave to the females made them all sound too weak for the strong women Berry portrays. The book was good for a library checkout, but I'm glad I didn't buy it."
4,"Slow start, excellent finish!","This ended up being a really good read. It started off a little slow and took a few chapters to really grab my attention but once it did I couldn't wait to read the conclusion.There have been a lot of reviewers calling this a Da Vinci Code ripoff, but I disagree. The only relations to Dan Brown here, I believe, is that it is about the Knights Templars. I think James Rollins Map of Bones was closer to the Da Vinci Code than this book here."
3,Hard to get into...,"Took to long to make a point, too all over the place. The hero doesnt make sense to the story. Good material, poor story."
2,Not that impressed,"The story was OK but I am not sure how much real ""history"" is there and how much of the story is ""story""."
3,"well, i finished it...","not bad, like most have posted already, more character developement would have really helped out the story,that being said, i did enjoy the book and will continue with the series."
4,Good Templar Tale,"A reasonably entertaining read for those who enjoyed The Da Vinci Code. For something more factual (& shocking), consider Brotherhood of the Sun. Secret Architecture of Our Nation's Capital is also worth investigating."
2,"Two stars plus -- okay, but not stellar.","I disagree with the one poster's assertion that it offers ""few facts"". For a work of fiction, it actually contains quite a number of facts (though I understand the quote often attributed to Pope Leo X both in this book and elsewhere is misattributed).If you're a gung-ho, believe it all (or most) Christian, you wouldn't like this kind of book anyway ... and could have guessed that you wouldn't by reading the description of the book."
5,great book,"if you liked the da vinci code you will like this book, its definately a good read, and will keep you interested"
3,Entertaining novel,"Sure this book was predictable at times and followed the Da Vinci Code playbook. However, I was entertained and enjoyed the story----something I cannot say about Dan Brown's latest. It won't win a Pulitzer but that was not what I was looking for."
4,Templar,A fascinating read especially if one is keeping up with the history of the Templars. Since no one book can provide all the insight into the Templars story from their beginning to their supposed end.
4,Good and Bad...,"As a christian I am irritated by his ""in the moment"" story line of debunking Jesus. I consider it an irrational and unfounded slam against my beliefs and principals, but as a reader I am enthralled by his quick paced writing, similar to James Rollins. I read his first book ""The Amber Room"" and loved it so I bought this one - and I will purchase more because his writing is excellent even if his beliefs are flawed. Don't hesitate to purchase and enjoy."
2,A Yawner,"Weak characters and plot. I found myself daydreaming while reading this book, which isn't good. There are better thiogns to spend your money on. Pass this one by."
5,Another well written novel from Berry,The Knights Templar have been subjects in many novels - First read about them in Ivanhoe - Berry deals with modern day Knights Templar and scholars on a quest similar to The DaVinci Code. But any story well handled and played is no problem for me regarding similarities - It is exciting and is a great read.That to me is worth the read.
1,could it get any worse...,i doubt it. truly one of the worst written books i have ever read. so bad i felt compelled totype this out on a kindle and you know what that is like. do not buy this under pain of intense boredom.
1,Really pathetic,"I bought this at the airport news stand, needing something to occupy me for the 6 hour flight across country. Instead, after a couple hundred pages I could not bear to turn another page and chose to watch clouds pass by out the window. My gosh, the ""research"" that went into this book could have been done better with a couple of google searches. The ""character development"" is unbelievably poor, and the plot can be predicted from reading the book jacket.Yes, the book is anti-christian, which may attract some readers, but the fact that it is boring should dissuade anyone from bothering with this tripe. The amount of cliche plot devices is astounding. Save your money & your time."
2,dan brown wannabe,all i can say is it is a good thing it was free. too much unnecessary detail and contrived puzzles....i cannot believe i even finished it
1,"Immature, Muslim Myths about Jesus","An atheist or Muslim may enjoy this fantasy but Catholic, Baptist or Protestant, all will find it offensive. The McGuffey herein are the bones of Jesus ""proving"" that he did not rise or appear after death in a glorified body.Poorly researched from the point of really basic Catholic beliefs, the book makes the timeworn, ignorant charge that Catholics pray to statues! Even the most uneducated detractor of Catholicism realizes that a statue or picture of Jesus is like a photo of a beloved family member which helps keep one's mind on the spiritual object of the prayer. And Catholics do not pray for saints to grant requests, but rather that the saint intercede on their behalf."
1,Really poor writing,"Wretched book--obvious plot, stilted dialog, thinnest charactor developement. Simply awful, and a waste of time and money. If curiosity is just too much, get this door stop of a novel from your local library."
3,DaVinci Templars,"The Templar Legacy is only a novel. The word is even part of its title. It isn't meant to be serious history, an anti-christian diatribe, or any of the other things so many readers seem bothered by. Yes, Cotton is a stupid name. No, the character devopment is rather poor. I read this book because of my interest in the Knights, Rennes, and the middle ages. But I expected it to be a light form of entertainment and that's what it is. Having read other Berry titles, I knew beforehand that he simply isn't a great writer. Dan Brown probably isn't either. Anyone who reads fiction hoping to learn real history will be mislead."
2,"Crash, Boom, Big Bang","This was my first experience with Mr. Berry's work and wheras I will say I enjoyed his writing style enough to keep turning pages, I would not recommend this book to anyone based on the plot.When it turns from being an enjoyable story into an agenda driven doctrine of (non) belief based on stuff the guy made up to tie together loose ends, that's when I know that I've had enough of the Da Vinci ""Mode"" for a while.I'm going back to DeMille."
2,"Good story, poorly written...","I won't rehash the many criticisms of this book... but fair warning to anyone who picks it up: the story is good, but a little cliched and dull in points. Characters are one dimensional and dialogue is contrived and wooden (tip for author - when characters ""shout"", try adding an exclamation point or anything other than a simple period.) Writing style is decent and the story contains fairly good dramatic elements, but there's nothing new here... a good vacation read, but nothing more. One cool thing - I like that the author highlighted his variations from actual history at the end of the book, and didn't try and pretend that the historical context was accurate - Dan Brown could take a queue from this."
2,More than a little disappointed,"I realize that not all books by the same author are going to be of the same quality, and I went into ""The Templar Legacy"" expecting a lot more.I was not interested in the characters, who didn't seem as though they would ever exist in real life and I really didn't care what their fates would turn out to be. Cotton, especially, seemed without a personality.The most unsettling aspect of this novel was that its ""secret"" was not based on any logic. It seems as though the ""theory"" came first and then all the jigsaw puzzle pieces were cut to fit. Where there were no puzzle pieces with which to play, another puzzle piece was miraculously found at the end.It's not unusual that Christians would be offended at the book's ""interpretation"" of a basic New Testament occurence.I also think that people who demand logic in the course of a novel, should be the ones most offended."
1,Blaaah. (Bland Characters=Bland Story),"I am right now reading this book, but I'm finding it a real struggle to get through. It's not that the plot confuses me at all. The problem I'm having is that I cannot bring myself to give a rat's a** what happens to any of the characters (and that always diminishes my interest in a novel!!) For me, characters that are so bland and flat and one dimensional (as Berry's are here) make for a very dull read. At this point, I'm merely persevering for the sake of finishing what I started.I'd not read any Steve Berry books before. . .just spied this in a used bookstore and was dazzled by the effusive cover blurbs, so I snatched it up. Is this book a fair representative of all of Berry's writings? If so, then I will mentally earmark him a ""one-to-skip"" author. But I pose the question, since I wouldn't want to write the guy off unfairly..."
2,"Idea OK, but pretty boring read",I liked The Amber room and thought I would try this. I love to read so I stuck with it. However it kept going over the same material with not much action. I would not recommend this to readers who like suspense and action. NOT in the league with Da Vinci Code.
4,Mainly Good,"A very credible account of imagined Templar behaviour. Steve Berry always strings a story together well but his main man, Cotton Malone is like Bill Smith from Muleshoe, Texas, in that he knows everyone and everyone knows him.I have yet to see him meet a stranger."
1,Avoid this audio unless you need a good nights sleep,"I listen to books on audio when I am making a long drive and want to be sure I stay alert. This CD definitely failed the test. I don't know what I found most irritating about this presentation.....the story itself or the tedious, monotonous voice of the reader. The book goes on and on with boring pseudo-facts that do not contribute much to the story, but do however lull the listener/reader into a stupor. After reading Berry's thoroughly enjoyable and compelling ""The Amber Room"", I was really looking forward to this tome. What a disappointment."
2,The Rev. Berry,"I purchased the audio book version for a road trip and around the 4th or 5th disc began fast forwarding chapters. The action and loose plot, along with mostly weak characters -- that whole cotton thing is pretty annoying-- were decent until Berry began preaching his disdain for the opium for the masses beliefs. Why do writers seem to have a need to ruin good stories with long periods of sticky shove-it-in-your-face beliefs, outlandish lies and false conclusions. Stick to action and mystery, and leave the religious ""education"" to those with an ounce of true knowledge, not an axe to grind."
4,Fun & thought provoking,"This book had many good historical points especially about the originationof the Gospels and the Templars.I enjoyed it very much. A little slow in the middle and one of the main characters lacks depth. Still it is fun & thought provoking.It was not quite as good as The Third Secret.I enjoy Berry's books - his research seems good, he ties together variousdiverse topics and has a more personal less fantastic perspective thanDan Brown. I am always excited to read his next book."
4,Interesting.,"The Templar Legacy by Steve Berry is an enjoyable read. The story covers all the same old Templar histories, but the author's added insights especially on the conflicts found in the gospels is refreshing. That truth is not the enemy of faith is once again proved out in this story of modern day Templars struggling between righting ancient wrongs and remaining true to the foundations of their order. The clues and puzzles that drive all the characters and the rights and wrongs of their own personal pasts add intrigue and scope. The story also has a small important part of modern life that most literature totally ignores, that of the divorced man who is living away from his children. What gives this story real worth is that the reader is left to weigh the value of truth, wealth, and knowledge against each other. This is a book of many puzzles some are blatant and others merely nuances."
2,More heapings of heresy,"I found the plot to be interesting in the very beginning. But it began to unravel very quickly for me. About three quarters through the book, I realized that this novel was written to piggyback the Dan Brown novel. Both the Dan Brown novel and Mr. Berry's share an aversion and dislike of orthodox Christianity. They avoid the entire New Testament in favor of gnostic writings or in the case of the Templar Legacy, create new books and sayings of Jesus that serve the purposes of the plot!. A more interesting book could have been written focusing on a surviving monastery of Templars. Do yourself a favor a skip this one and avoid the sour taste in your mouth after the reading the fantastical and highly unlikely ending."
1,Bloody terrible book!,"I read this book with the expectation that it was going to be a similar story to that of the DaVinci code or at least somewhat captivating. Wow, was I wrong, the book was extremely prolonged and I was amazed to find out that it never picked up. The whole book was a wretched BORE! Only the last two chapters were remotely interesting, don't buy this book you will regret wasting your time! I had to keep reading, because I could not believe that it was so bad all the way through!"
1,Out of box failure - Samsung will not stand by product,"This was a Christmas gift that was an out of the box failure. I have spent 4 weeks and countless hours trying to get Samsung to stand by their product or as a last resort, their customer..I have appealed through their Voice of the Customer System the employees of which do not get back to you and refuse to provide a replacement. They never fullfilled their obligation to provide a working product for the $170.00 we ultimately paid."
1,This One is a Dog,This player cannot load music from a Mac. It also cannot load music from a Linux computer. This player also will not load music from outside of the US. Buy something else.
3,Too much enphasis on WTO and less on other organizations,"The book is full of details on the WTO structure, legal framework of the Agreements and operation, but, although over 900 pages long, it lacks depth in other areas: OECD, IMF, World Bank, NGOs active in the field etc. As it too often happens with American authors, mostly monolingual, Lowenfeld does not include French and German doctrinal works, which is a pity, as International Law, in General, and International Economic Law, specifically, are well developed in countries such as France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Austria.If the title changed to something like ""The Role of WTO in the International Economic Society"" it would match more closely it true content.José Cretella Neto, Professor of International Law and corporate lawyer."
4,Juice Fasting and Detoxification: Use the Healing Power of Fresh Juice to Feel Young and Look Great,Juice Fasting and Detoxification: Use the Healing Power of Fresh Juice to Feel Young and Look Great tells you some of the stuff you need to know about the subject. no one book can tell it all!!
1,What????,"Is this a joke? I expected something with a little substance, but all this is is hype. No science, no studies, no real information backed up by anything other than opinions. Plus, there are very few recipes. I want to know what does what, not a just a lot of mumbo jumbo. Don't waste your money."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"When I opened this book at random, the first page I turned to told me that if I wanted to go on this juice fast it was strongly recommmended that one should give oneself frequent enemas and/or colonics as long as you were juice fasting. I was just looking for a few healthy juice recipes, this was clearly too extreme for me."
3,so so,this book is nice but is not what i was expecting to be... doesn't contain any pictures of the juice or recipes but the good thing is that you can really learn from it.
2,No recipes,"I was bummed there were hardly any recipes (like about 8 of them). It is more informational about fasting, the benefits of juice, etc.I would send it back but it is not worth the hassle."
3,"Interesting, but not the greatest","The book was interesting, but I was hoping for more ""to do"" things listed."
1,Juice Fast,"Unreal. Short term fasts are more realistic. Unless you're loaded with money and time to take 10+ days of vacation, you can't realistically do this, not in a job that deals with the public. Still, it's all talk, common sense -stop shoveling food in your face and get off your couch and exercise. There's no scientific data, no detailed info on how to fast effectively. The chapters are terribly repetitive and end in a promotion for juice machines. I am returning this book for a refund or exchange. I find nothing worth revisiting in this book."
3,To vague,Not enough on real recipes and strategies for detox. It's a start for someone introduced to juicing for the first time.
3,Not enough recipes,I was hoping for more specific juice recipes. And a specific regime for juice fasting for the purpose of cleansing. But I guess juicing is kind of a gestalt sort of thing. Put this and that together and see how you like it and do it a bit differently next time.
4,First time juicer,Very informative. Told me just what to expect as a first time juicer. The only reason I deducted a star was I would have liked to have seen more recipes.
3,Informative but I was expecting actual recipes!,"Title pretty much says It all, very informative book I was just hoping for some recipes as well. Looks like I'll be shopping for another book!"
5,Full of Great Info and Easy to Read,"Everyone is entitled to their opinion, of course, but I can't imagine why anyone would give this book a two star review and say that it does not contain enough information. This book is full of information. I have just finished reading this book, as well as the author's wheatgrass book (which I would also strongly recommend), and the amount of specific information that he packs into such a slim book is impressive. I can't think of a single question which was not answered for me somewhere in the book. Any concerns or questions you might have about this controversial subject are answered with real facts, not hype or new age mumbo jumbo. The author's writing style is also very easy to read. I have not tried a juice fast yet, but after reading this book I am getting ready to, and I know I'll be coming back to the book for consultation as I go."
4,Excellent overview of the juice fasting process.,"He doesn't give any recipes for juicing but does explain clearly and concisely the juice fast from start to finish. What to expect, how to encourage the detox process, personal motivation, and how to know when to stop as well as how to stop. Get a different book for recipes, but get this one for the confidence to do the fast safely."
4,Very informative book on detox with juicing,"What I love most about this book, other than the cornucopia of juicing recipes and suggestions, is that it is informative without being preachy. The author simply provides the necessary info and instructions for even a beginner to start juicing - kind of like sticking your toes into the water before jumping in. Costing under $10 on Amazon, it's definitely a handy little reference to have in the kitchen."
1,pushes to much more than juicing,to me a juicing book should give you juice diets not the strangereligious beliefs of the author. not a book for me or my house
2,Not enough details on how much of what to use.,There are not enough details in this book on how to actually go about juicing as a way to get healthy. The novice juicer will not get a clue from this book on how much of each ingredient to use to make the juices palatable and effective.
3,ET PHONE HOME????,"This book does contain some very useful nutrition based information and recipes. However, it leans predominantly in some sort of spiritual direction. The illustrations are somewhat bizaar to me, to include a figure sitting indian style surrounded by fourteen angels holding scripts with phrases on them, such as ""Eternal Life"" and ""The Earthly Mother"". Also some of the advice just didn't seem right to me, such as the recommendation on pg.85 to self induce vomitting if you have a persistent headache from fasting.Again, this book does contain very informitive nutritional advice, if you don't mind the bizaar drawings and highly spiritual base of this book."
1,Not a how-to...,This book does not explain how to do a proper juice fast/detox. It is page after page of why someone would want or need to fast/detox. There are no recipes or even a basic plan. A huge disappointment!
5,GREAT BOOK!,"I love this book! I reference it often for a quick reminder every now and then. It's written beautifully and succinctly. He avoids the jargon, and keeps it a simple to use, yet highly informative resource. It's one of those books, that once you start reading, you find it hard to put down. He communicates even the most scientific information in a matter-of-fact way, that keeps it practical. I found his writing style entertaining, and it's still one of my favorite health books to date. He demystifies the whole subject of detoxification, and makes it easy to practice without much ado.A great book.Elisha."
2,Just OK...,"I bought this book after researching juicing pretty extensively on the Web. This book was fine, but it really didn't add anything to the information I'd already gained for free."
4,Good book!,"A basic understanding of the power of juicing is what you will learn from this book. Simple read, and enjoyable."
3,dissapointed in this,"I know most people will discount this review but when I opened the book I was very excited about starting juicing. After turning a few pages there was a quote from some book ""Essene Gosple of Peace"" with a saying of Jesus. I've read the Bible and studied it and I've never read anything remotely like the quote. The first thing that popped into my mind was ""take not council from the ungodly"" after turning a few more pages there was an illistration with a guy in a yoga position and cherubs flying holding banners saying differant things. I'm sure the guy has good info, but I'm not willing to put this in my mind. I bought the ""Juice Lady Turbo Diet"" instead and am very pleased."
2,Disappointing...did not meet my needs,"If you are looking for a meaty book with lots of specific info on juicing and fasting regimens....this is not it. Okay I guess for the newbiest of newbies but if you have already done some fasting and want info on more advanced techniques and/or serious detoxing, etc. look elsewhere."
1,Juice Fasting,"Wasn't happy with this book, not at all what I was hopeing for, to much reading not enough receipes, sent this book back"
5,One of the most complete guides to fasting I've ever used,"Anyone new to fasting should check out this book. It walked me step by step through my first fast, so there were no 'surpises.' I was able to achieve a safe and very beneficial fast and I attribute that to this wonderful guide."
3,Not a Receipe Book,"This is an excellent resource on WHY fasting can be beneficial and how to best accomplish it - different types of fasing, the benefits and potential problems with each, and how to accomplish the fast. If, however, you're looking for a book with specific receipies to follow while on a juice fast, the book is light."
2,"Some good information, the rest is garbage","I bought this book to better help me in managing my Crohn's disease during flare-ups. I pretty much bought the book based on the title and thought it would be helpful.The author right off the bat says that if you are going to fast, you REALLY need to fast without ANY intake of food except water, but if you are going to juice fast, this is how you do it. He concentrated more on fasting than juice fasting, which seems to make this book title mis-leading.He also goes as far as saying that self-purging (finger down the throat) may be required to purge the body of inpurities. Whoa, time out, that is a bit extreme.I cannot give the book just one star, because there was some good information in there about fasting symptoms and other general tid-bits, but since this author has absolutely no credentials, I would seriously question anything he suggests to do."
5,"Excellent book, covers the topics very well","I'm new to fasting, and this book answered virtually all of my questions. He covers the aspects I am interested in - from the motivation to fast, how long to fast, water and juice fasting, a section I really enjoyed on detoxification, the psychology of fasting, and how to come off the fast. As an extra bonus, the book also discusses how to buy a juicing machine (I didn't know there are four different types!) and concludes with several pages of additional resources, including web sites and other organizations that can provide additional information. The text is well written, easy to follow, and I found it a joy to read.There is a lot more to fasting than just not eating. This book gives me the ideas and means to do an effective fast, and for that I am very grateful."
4,Informative!,This book was very easy to read and quite informative. It gave you reasons WHY things are bad for you instead of just saying they are bad. This book is a great motivator! I tried it myself for 2.5 days and I did lose weight. I recommend this to anyone who is looking to detox their body and lose weight!
4,Great for beginners.,"This book comes with recipe ideas throughout, as well as loads of information about how you will begin to feel during your juice fast, what warning signs to look out for, the spiritual implications of juicing, and how to diet pre-fast, as well as reintroduce food back into your system afterwards. A great read for anyone just learning how to get into juicing, especially if you have no idea what you're doing! It also discusses the differences between the types of juice-machines out there in case you don't have one yet."
2,Not good,"This is a great book on fasting, I was really looking for detail on juicing in particular and this missed the mark for me. Juice fasting is definitely mentioned, but did not appear to be the primary focus of the book. Depends on what you are looking for, I would not have gotten this if I had a better understanding of the content."
3,not what I thought,"bought two books on juicing,this one actually had more about water fasting,whats up with that,since it is a book about juice fasting"
3,Wanderer of the Wasteland Zane Gray,I am 86 and used to read these books as a child. I just wanted to bring back a memory. They are real Oaters.
3,Great Source Material for your next D&D Outing,"As with other reviewers, I can't describe this book as great literature. It's not. But it is great escapist fun in a fairly well developed little fantasy world. Of course the highlight of the book are the Hildebrandt sketches and color plates. These really breath life into the story and give this book something special that very few other books can provide.That said, the plot is completely predictable, but like any good B Movie, we are reading for the simple joy of a great fantasy ride.Now, I read this book back when creating the next dungeon setting for the weekend was my most important priority. This book was excellent for stirring the creative juices and putting together some memorable D&D; adventures.So I am in agreement with another reviewer, that this particular book is a great nostalgic ride to the time when collecting 20 sided die actually has some meaning in our lives."
3,Artwork redeems it...a bit,"I picked this book up because it was an illustrated novel, and I think that more authors should try to project their work into the visual realm in addition to the written.The actual story in Urshurak, while fast-paced, is painfully cliched. The bro's H put a lot more creativity into their artwork than the writing, although towards the end even the environmental artwork seems uninspired. It's pretty clearly a ""movie"" novel, though at the time of its writing I don't think they could have realized it very well on film.That being said, I still enjoyed the work, and I think it would be great reading material for younger readers. It's just disappointing that the story isn't up to par with the illustrations."
4,The Sword of Shannara's Step-Child,"Believe it or not, I still have a copy of this book, trade paperback format, dating from the late seventies, and I agree that the artwork is superb. I consider it as one of the prized books in my collection, along with the original hardback edition of Sword of Shannara with the Hildebrandt centerfold. The story is reminiscient of Shannara and Rings, but it is still enjoyable for anyone who loved those stories. What I'd like to know is whether the authors ever wrote any other stories, Urshurak-related or not."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Pretty enjoyable standard sort of fantasy novel, with some characters that actually seemed to be people."
3,"A original copy, or attempt at.","This was my first fantasy book I ever read. At the time I was 15 and looking for an escape in literature. When I fell upon this story I thought it great. Having completed it in only two seatings, I then bragged it to my friend a fellow fantasy vixon. He told me about Tolkien and the rest is history. While Urshurak is ""good"" reading, a beginners book to fantasy, of course Tolkien is the above all, the master. With Urshurak, I found that the pace was to quick, and the characters were not developed enough. Would I recommend it...yes. But I would also follow my recomendation with a nod to the above mentioned master. One needs to read what is pretended and what is real."
2,"Great Graphics, Lousy Story","I read this book twenty years ago. Although, I enjoyed the artwork by the Hildebrandt Brothers --the story is not compelling nor entertaining enough. Some of the characters and cultures are interesting. But the story is a predictable, anti-climactic, plodding mess. Still, great pictures! This is one of the few LORD OF THE RINGS imitations that came out during the Tolkien craze of the 1970's. THE SWORD OF SHANNARA is a far better book with a more powerful and climactic story. Also, URSHURAK is probably the first politically correct Tolkien-type fantasy novel (with its characters of strong women and black heroes -- nothing wrong with that, but it seems contrived and they're only secondary to the main character who is a blonde-haired, blue-eyed, Aryan-type White Elf prince)."
1,these bags are disasters!!,"I don't recommend these bags because they explode while using, I mean all of them. And the explosion totally messed up my home again and again. I will never buy this item from this seller. Defective items."
5,"Dee Zee DZ 86721 Universal Heavyweight Bed Mat 72"" X 98""","Dee Zee DZ 86721 Universal Heavyweight Bed Mat 72"" X 98""All I can say is WOW!!!! Sweet :0)Very very happy with the quality of this mat and the price point. After checking local pricing on a bed liner it became painfully obvious I could not afford to have someone do it for me.My 69 truck only had a couple options available and trimming was going to be required. This mat is heavy duty to say the least, Its built like a tire casing.I used a razor blade knife and cut as required. Measure twice, cut once.Including a couple pictures for your viewing pleasure.Buy with confidence.RagenRat"
5,Bed mat,"Recieved as advertised. Quality product. Fast shipping. Would definatly purchase again in the future. Was able to trim the mat to fit my older truck, because a custom fit was no longer available."
4,My first Apple product...,"Boy! this is very beautiful, and good capabilities. my iBook is the 14"" with 256 MB, and it runs quite ok. although there is slight down side with its speed while opening an app. or running a video. but rest its gorgoeus, and runs quite good, if you are in to looks and style this is perfect. its software integration is greate. and i absolutely love it. if its for personal use at home or studies this is perfect i gues."
2,"Sorry I bought it, but happy with newer material","Ok- first of all, when I heard the Devics on KCRW, I thought (and still think) they were amazing. I still have that podcast, and I bought Distant Radio. But MBSS is not really the same style. It was mostly depressing vocals with piano accompanyment- just not what I was hoping for. I like their newer stuff (more energy, both Sara and Dustin singing together, and some amazing guitar added) and am looking forward to the new cd."
4,Popular Japanese Teen Fashion Mag,"This was the first Japanese magazine I had ever perused and I was pretty impressed by all the pretty, yet conservative models. Some of the fashions are wacky and funny to the American reader, but that's what they go for. Some fashions, however, find their way into the US scene years later. Keep that in mind. The Japanese are, for the most part, trendsetters. Hong Kong and Taiwan just copy them. Most of the magazine is in color but the black and white section is probably just horoscopes, advice and interviews. I don't know. I can't read Japanese. It's alright because the pictures are entertaining enough. By the way, the Japanese have a ravenous obsession with shoes. Whatever nobody else is really wearing, they'll wear it. I hear that their fashion changes each week. I wonder how much money they spend on clothes..."
5,A glimpse of life,"Mr. Carroll has captured nature as it truly is. Like a fine craftsman he was one with the subject and as an artist he has accurately recorded what he observed and has presented the information coherently. I'm left with an indelible, poignant legacy."
4,Good book about New England wetlands,"I really liked this book. The book is a series of short stories, really, each focusing on one of the author's experiences in a different type of New England wetland. Together they make a great whole, but you could pick it up and enjoy reading the chapters in any order. The prose leans towards the poetic, so sometimes it was hard to pick it up and read, but once I did, I also had trouble putting it down! I liked the book so much it made me go out and look for frogs last week!"
4,Walk A Wetland With This Guy,"Well-written and an easy read. It made me want to do 2 things: Strap on my waders and head to the nearest wetland to see what I can find and order the other books in his ""wet sneaker"" trilogy. Enjoy."
4,No Comparison with Local Ground,"I have been an Altan fan for years, and without hesitation can say Local Ground is not only the best CD for Altan and its band members, but one of the very best Irish traditional music CDs in recent years. While there are a few tracks with simple guitar back up that got my full attention, I was much more fascinated with Ciaran's work with Altan and early Ciaran with solo (""naked"")fiddle on the Fiddlesticks CD, a lovely early recording of a fiddle festival at the College University Cork."
1,Don't pay more than $1 for this!,"My daughter likes this. But it's only 26 pages of low-quality paper, for $9.99. Don't buy it.Other cheaper products have hundreds of pages of coloring and educational material.This one is a waste of time."
4,Simple and effective,Simple and effective way to expose & teach young children about the Torah. Also can be helpful as preparation for Bar/Bat Mitzvah.
1,WOW ... the author must have needded the money ..,"because this book rates a 5 on the ho hummm scale of tedium .....I mean even the story is contrived. Jade Kimberly, a magazine writer decides to bit the bullet (thats what she actually should have done) and quit her work to write a romance novel. The editor thinks it stinks and says she has to sex it up ....Since Jade has no experience in sex.. having had only one boyfriend, who left her, she decides to start exploring to see what she could learn .... Problem is that she doesnt stra far and sticks to a local pick up guy at a bar, her boyfirend and her best girlsfreind(who conveniently happens to be a closet lesbian)It alsomst got to the point that hte story became a Penthouse letter !"
4,Old School Horror is the best!,"Best horror flick of all time. Not a lot of gore, like the useless so called horror films of today. The storyline was easy to follow, unlike horror films of today, which some of them can be very difficult to follow. You can watch the film two, three, times and it still doesn't make sense. Back in the seventies, creative writers were abundant and was good at the craft- making a good ol' scary flick. Horror films of today are just a waste of time and money, plain and simple."
1,one stinky piece of cheese,"there's one reason and one reason only to watch this and that is if you saw it when you were young and wish to re-live those feelings. nothing wrong with that but i beg you, do not become confused and imagine that anyone watching this for the first time now will in any way tolerate it. under no circumstances become sentimental and ask your children to watch it. after around 4 seconds of viewing time they will look at you in the same way as if they walked in on you and found you lying in your self-soiled bed."
1,Received JUNK,"This ""used"" video was unwatchable. Merchant promised to credit my credit card account. NEVER DID. Wasn't worth my headaches. Would not deal with this business again. Only company I've had a problem with through Amazon."
2,disappointed,"I was very disappointed by the lack of inclusion of the subjects, and article inclusion about latex allergy in the beginning that i didn't understand because it was there( i only want a commented guide, anything plus, and with the maximum of possible information). The comments are very good, but with relationship of the research of published subjects, definitively terrible!"
2,Misinformation in both of her books,"Although there are nice pictures and NICE overinflated prices,there is much information and labeling of yellow ware that is incorrect. It is obvious that this author doesn't know enough about pottery to be considered an authority on yellow ware. the only book that I know of that has the correct information for the begginer and the scholar is Gallo's book, a great reference. When is he going to do another one?"
1,Not for Mac,"I cant see my DVD, when it loads, freezes in the main menu. So you better dont buy. Get a book."
4,The new generation of Cuban emigrants,"Stalin Martinez is an accurate representation of the average current Cuban emigrant. He debates himself between running away from a society where decent working people barely survive and feeling guilty at the same time for ""betraying"" his countrymen, his family, his so called ""principles"". The damage suffered by the generations exposed to a constant brainwash since early childhood arises in this mature man, suffering now the humiliation of hiding on the top of some roof under inhuman conditions to get the tan and look of a rafter.Once again Jesus Diaz makes use of his magical mixture of sharp humor and deep seriousness -an extremely Cuban combination- to give us a brief look at the Cuban reality. No doubts, this is a good book about Cubans, here and there. Even though, being away from the island for some years now, leads him to make some mistakes. He is becoming more an exile writer that a Cuban writer. And that's a real shame."
4,Too short,"These are the worst covers in the world. The problem is that the book is too short. This is the kind of book that I don't want to end, but to keep going and going. From fingerless fiddlers to folks who can't count the five members in their group (The Master's Four), the worst is here. I know that there are more poor covers out there, find them and report back."
1,The worst vacuum we've had,"This is the worst vacuum we have ever used. It is very heavy to push and tips easily when you are using the hose. The belts break easily (we replaced it three times in less than two months). It is also very loud. I would not recommend it to anyone, it was a waste of money."
2,Not made well and too heavy. Picks up dirt and dust well.,The machine operates well. But I think it is poorly constructed and to heavy.
2,Dusty,"The 086930 sucks up dirt better than my last vacuum, but I don't like it. This was my first bagless vacuum & I was really excited about the canister. That canister turned out to be the most disgusting part. I have to take the vacuum outside to empty it because of the dust. Once I'm outsite, the big stuff doesn't even come out of the canister so I have to shake it over the garbage can. It's the messiest thing ever."
1,I hate this vacuum,Don't buy this thing. It's terrible. It's VERY noisy and heavy. It doesn't suck up even the smallest pieces of lint. I'm very frustrated with it. It tips over very easily. It's bashed into more than one wall in my house. You would be throwing your money away!!
1,The clog-o-matic,"This is the worst vacuum!! We bought this vacuum less than a year ago. The motor works great and so does the hose attachment. However, the hose from the floor to the canister clogs ALL THE TIME. It has been doing this with more and more frequency since 3mos after we bought it. No, we don't have a dog!! Nothing has ever been in there except for globs of dirt. We were going to buy a more expensive vacuum and now I wish we had. This is a piece of junk.This is the first time I didn't send in my warranty. Of course, it is a design flaw and not mechanical so a warranty wouldn't do me much good. We are throwing this one out and getting a new one!"
1,This is the worst vacuum we've ever had,we had this vacuum less than 1 year. The day I got it home the plastic thing that holdsthe cord broke off. I should have returned it. It cloggs almost daily. And it doesn't clean well. I will never buy a dirt devil again.
4,Skarsgard shows what he's made of,"Insomnia is quite an achievement for a first time feature director, Erik Skjoldbjrg. The photography is very good and the FEEL of the picture is top notch. Not a mystery with a gimmick ending, Insomnia instead is a moody, almost creepy portrait of a detective who's meager morality nearly rivals his prey. Skarsgard is brilliant, he is quite a presence on screen in contrast the small roles he has been limited to in Hollywood. While the Pacino remake is a good movie, the original is a darker, braver film."
3,"not that good, but better than the american version.","i'm not that experienced with norwegian independent films. but, on a whim, i rented this movie with my friends just prior to going to see the new version (Nolan, 2002) and found them both very enjoyable. However, in terms of characterisation and plot development, I found this version to be much more worthwhile. first of all, this makes the protagonist to seem much less ethical and moral in comparison to the 'heroic' al pacino in the new version. It was what it claimed to be : a straightforward psychological thriller, with the added quirk of the amorality - or seeming nature thereof - of the protagonist.Directorially, and cinematographically, however, it's nothing really new. If anything, it feels slightly dated in production and direction. For a crisper, more ""avant-garde"" touch, try the new version - and just don't watch the last fifteen minutes. That's what America (Hollywood) does to good, ambiguous plots like these."
4,Much better than remake,"The first time I saw Insomnia I was intrigued and disturbed. The second time I enjoyed the film more, but I didn't realize its beauty until I watched the remake by director Nolan. The protagonist in Nolan's version is much less of a morally ambiguous character,the cinematography is postcard beautiful and his ending very ""Hollywood."" The new version has helped me to see the greatness of Erik Skjoldbjaerg's film."
3,Very Good,an amazing looking film. beautifully shot. wonderfully acted. really superb. although i had hoped for (and expected) a little more... maybe the story just lacked a bit
3,Not Great But Better than the Cheap American Version,"This is a straight film that seems to be hidden in dilluted colors and although it is much improved over the American version, there is still something lacking which could have made it a great film. It deals with a detective who is possessed not so much as by guilt, but an inability to come to grips with his existence."
4,Very Good but...,"First off it should be mentioned that this is a very original film that should be viewed by anyone trying to find something other than the average ""Hollywood"" film. I personally picked up the disc because it sounded and intersting and was being released by Criterion (the later being more than enough reason for me to buy any disc). I think this is a great movie but I wish there was an English soundtrack. I recognize that it is in it's original language but I find it easier to watch a film the first time in English and the second time in the original language with subtitles. Though this film probably won't confuse many people, an English soundtrack would have been much appreciated. Overall, a very good film that could have used English dubbing and possibly some more in the way of extras."
2,not good,this starts off as a pretty good thriller...and then disintegrates into an angsty existential piece...which I was not in the mood for. what a let down
4,A striking psychological thriller... from Norway!,"Visually stylish character study of a distraught detective on a homicide case in the land of the midnight sun. What distinguishes this from American thrillers is that the focus is on the detective and not on the mystery aspects. Very well acted, directed and written but not terribly intense. Still, it's an ambitious and haunting film with a great electronic score.The Criterion DVD boasts an absolutely gorgeous anamorphic transfer... one of the best I've seen."
4,Little known Gem,"Thank you Criterion for making this little known gem of a film available for all to see, and a great big double thank you to the FLAWLESS 16x9 transfer and excellent sound for this tense,well paced, Scandinavian film."
4,A dark and exciting murder mystery from Norway.,"In a small (northern) Norwegian town an insomniatic policeman is on the case of a murdered teenager. With problems of his own the police man struggles to find a killer and motive. This movie stars the Swedish actor, Stellan Skarsgard known for his role in Good Will Hunting. This is a great movie for anyone who would like an unpredictable Scandinavian mystery. In Norwegian and Swedish with English subtitles."
3,... made me sleepy,"A strange film about a detective who makes the dubious decision to cover up a case of friendly fire in an incident where he chases down a killer. The killer is smart, but there's one serious problem with the story - which bullet from which gun killed whom? Yes, there's a serious mistake in it, at least as far as I can tell. Beautiful women, and some interesting sex scenes, in Norway's land of the midnight sun."
4,Colonial Kitchens,"This book is exactly what I wanted, and exactly what it was advertised to be. I am extremely satisfied, both with the book and with the seller"
4,Peltex,"Please, please change the info from 22"" wide to 20"" wide. The 2"" difference can really matter, especially when it's a large project. I might have given the fifth star if the product had either actually been 22"" wide - or - the size description had been accurate. This is not as heavy as the no longer available Timtex, but it does the job. Because the interfacing is rolled around a base (like fabric bolts), there is some curve, but this does flatten out when the Peltex is encased within the fabric. The Amazon price is the best around - even better than ordering directly from the store that ships the item out!"
4,"Great stuff, especially for VOEH fans","This is a pretty good collection of rare R&B from groups like the Harlem Bus Stop and some reggae from The Truth, but this collection is extra special for the inclusion of the rare tracks from the underrated Soul Choir the Voices of East Harlem. This includes the legendary and breathtaking ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" which did well in England and on Black American Radio stations circa 1973 and ""Little People,"" which is consistant with their message of empowerment. Hopefully, since the release of their spellbinding performance in the SOUL TO SOUL DVD, more CDs of the VOEH will be forthcoming, but in the meantime, this and RIGHT ON BE FREE are the next best things."
2,Small Disappointment,"Point In Time was a surprise to me in that it seemed repetitious and predictable. I was not especially drawn to Thorn, and contemplated putting this book down before finishing it. I was surprised also by the 5 star rating it had. I must say I have read better books."
5,Hypnotic yet primal,"This should appeal to fans of all rock in the broadest sense of the word. Elements of old U2, the Police, the Ramones, even a little Sunny Day Real Estate can be detected yet this is totally unique in its own right."
5,"Nearly Perfect Debut Release from 3-Piece ""The Exit""","Here it is 10 years past the release of ""New Beat"" and it is still a regular in my music rotation. Both releases by ""The Exit"" are fantastic in their own right. This albums reminds me of an early-80s power pop band playing pop punk. The guitar tones have lots of chorus and reverb for a sound that I can remember sounding unique compared to other similar bands of that era. The drummer is amazing, the bass is driving and the guitar work really stands out when it needs to and takes a back seat to let the bass and drums shine as well. Honestly, if I were in a 3-piece band, I would want it to sounds like ""The Exit"" ... regardless of what the ""Pitchfork"" reviewer says."
5,One of the best channeled books.,"Whatever happened to Divine Grace is behind Ramon Stevens other book Conscious Life one of the best channeled books I have ever read. The book gives support, faith and clearance. Things needed sometimes in these days."
2,"Dirt Devil' s ""Dust Devil Deluxe"" Fall Short","This product is not nearly as versatile as its competitor, the Hoover Dustbuster. The triangular ""crevice tool"" can hardly be described as adept at reaching into narrow spaces. Further, I don't recommend this product for asthmatics; the filter, at risk of tearing, is almost impossible to clean by hand without raising a dust storm, and the filters are not readily available in stores. I do like the retractable brush feature, and the suction is satisfactory. I guess some would consider the clear display of sucked up dirt a plus feature, but I find it rather distasteful. I'm on my way out to buy another Dustbuster!"
1,Don't Bother With This One,"I do not recommend this product.I have an older model, but the product seems about the same (IE recent reviews state similar problems).1. It hardly holds a charge. I don't find it convenient since it only works for a few minutes. I realize it's not supposed to replace a full vacuum, but I'd still like to be able to go around the baseboards of more than one room to pick up dust bunnies.2. It doesn't suck much. It picks up very light dust bunnies, but little else.3. The retractable brush is only about 1/8 inch deep, and mine got stuck in the out position.4. The attachements are of no value.5. The battery can not be replaced, so there is no opportunity to improve the poor ""5 minutes only"" charge.Forget this product. My parents have a similar product from a different manufacturer and it works MUCH better."
5,Great bars,This is a awesome four pack of pry bars. As a fabricator in a equipment manufacturing shop I use these bars daily to move steel pieces for welding and align holes for bolting. I have owned these bars for over a year now and have NOT broken or bent any of them. They are made out of great tool steel.
2,Good Story Line With The Lack Of Acting.,"This movie had a VERY good plot. The actors/actresses in the movie were rookies (and you could tell), but nevertheless some stood out. Dorian(much love) he had good camera appearence and new his part well, MUCH talent. OX he flowed with his part very well also, good job. The movie itself was untasteful for the nudity that it had in it. Big movie names (MONSTER BALL) don't even take it that far with nudity (HALLE BERRY).So the degrading of the females was obvious. It should've been rated X. The dialouge seemed as though they were just holding regular conversation rather then acting. Overall, the movie held a good story line with bad acting,with the exception of 3 charaters. The lack of acting, # of scenes and being unprofessional took away from the movie as a whole!"
3,This movie is a must if you........,"This movie is a must if you enjoy the thugish street type of movie. The plot is not the greastest but the nudity is something you will look forward too becasue of the story line. The camera work and direction was awsome and who ever those guys are who filmed it, I cant wait to see what else they will put out!!! BUY LOOTERS!!!!!! Its one of those movies youll watch and love when your drumk or high!"
2,Not a great toy,"I bought this toy at Toys R Us because it was on clearance for $7 (normally $15). I like the Peek-a-Blocks, and this one being so cheap, seemed like a good deal.Good points: it comes with four blocks (although by far not the most entertaining of the Peek-a-Blocks sets) and the music is soft and plays a very pleasant tune; it stores nicely, all 4 blocks fit inside and the unit is compact.Bad points: it is not very entertaining; my 6-month-old barely looks at it compared to her other toysThis is an okay toy for $7. For $15, there are much better toys out there."
2,Pass on this toy,"My daughter got this for her birthday. She doesn't even play with the fish. She likes the blocks, though, so we've put them in her other block toy and she plays with them.The blocks are too big for the fish and they don't come out easily. It's just not a fun toy."
2,Not so great,This was a bit of a disappointment. There is not enough space for very many blocks and the fish is difficult for a child to release the blocks. The best part of this toy is the music it plays when a block hits the sensor.
2,Tumblin' Sounds Goldfish,"I got this for my 2 yr old son, and he was not interested in it at all, now I have it in my toddler class age 1 to 3 yr olds and it is not a popular toy at all. Being kids they want to shove all the blocks into the fish at once, and due to this it gets blocked. I have noticed that kids get bored very quickly with this toy."
3,It's o.k.,"I agree with previous reviewers. It is hard to get all 4 blocks in the fish. It only plays music with the first block unless you are lucky. I also find it hard to push the fish to get the blocks out. It requires two hands or it tips over, which is a lot of coordination for babies. It is actually rated for 9 months and up (not 6 months as one reviewer said), but even so, it isn't the most interesting toy. I think the giraffe is better, though we don't own it. This toy is o.k., but it is not one of Fisher Price's best toys. Every child is different as far as what they like. This toy didn't hold my son's attention, but he also doesn't sit in one place for long!"
2,Not enough info,"The content is generally too ""theoretical"" to be of any help. It is more suited to a person who is evaluating sharepoint. A person looking for a reference to guide installation/development should look elsewhere. I expected at the very least a consolidation of the material at the MSDN, but I was wrong. The content is very shallow.I would have given it one star, but the CD contains useful web parts that one can use as templates to in creating your own."
3,Seemed like a good book,If you want ME style problems for the FE then this is good. Getting just the overall review book by the same author and doing the chapters is probably good enough. The test really isn't as hard as some of these reviews say. I have been out of school for 6 year and you can go through the review book in a couple weekends and some week nights.
3,Not the best...,"Several typo's and mistakes in the problems and solutions, but it is helpful to go through lots of practice problems before the exam. Just make sure you check for a typo before you get frustrated! Not sure if there is anything better, haven't looked."
2,Mostly Practice Problems,"Was expecting more review-type material, but instead the book was mostly practice problems. Good for testing your knowledge, but not very helpful if you needed to brush up on specific sections."
2,Disappointed,"After using the Morning exam prep by the author, I bought this book with big expectations, but I am very disappointed to see that it doesn't have any review material. This book has just 60 sample problems and 2 sample exams; not much for the money i paid for this book."
3,Poor Quality,"After reading a lot of reviews about the different 3 in 1 high back booster car seats, we decided to buy this one. The back's height/shoulder straps was very easy to adjust up or down. We liked that the arm rests made our 3 yr. old feel like a big kid in that they could be flipped up out of the way for her to climb in by herself. Our compaints are that the straps were very hard to tighten when our child was sitting in it - didn't feel safe (seemed like there was something wrong with the tightening mechanism) & the diamond shaped stitching in the seat was all coming loose after only a week of use. We returned it & bought the Graco - Nautilus 3 in 1 & am extremely happy with it! Would definitely recommend spending the little extra $ for it (best price for it was on-line at Wal-Mart)."
2,Not Impressed,"Our daughter outgrew her Britax Roundabout. We bought the Eddie Bauer seat as a replacement because it would saftely hold our tall child. The Britax seat is much higher quality in all aspects: the frabic, cushion, belt fastners, etc. We are just used to the extra niceties of our Britax seat and dislike the Eddie Bauer because it isn't as nice. I would definately spend the extra money on another Britax before buying an Eddie Bauer."
2,Vacuum cleaner bags not Royal Dirt Devil !!!!,"These bags are advertised as Dirt Devil with the name on the bag. THEY ARE NOT ROYAL DIRT DEVIL BAGS. They are reproduced by EnviroCare Technologies. The bag states that they are designed and developed in the USA, BUT in the end they are manufactured in China. Ripoff!!!!!!!!! It is only a guess so far if they will perform as they should.The only good thing is the ship time. I ordered on Monday and received them on Wednesday. Very Quick."
1,Horrible Not Even Funny,The first volume had a demented man talking and I thought it was the funniest thing ever. This album has nothing and it stinks. The music is also horrible quality.
4,One of the more reliable Donnelly books,"This is a good book to start with if you are interested in getting into the whole Donnelly thing. The Donnellys, for all of you not familiar with the story, were Irish immigrants who settled near Lucan, Ontario, which is situated near London, Ontario. On the night of February 3, 1880, after decades of feuding in the township, the Donnelly family was murdered by a vigilante group consisting of a number of locals. Ever since every aspect of the story has been mired in controversy and is still a hot-topic in that part of southern Ontario, so much so that a number of novels and dramas have been written about it."
3,Family history,"I purchased this with interest as a family member is decended from them. It proved to be interesting, if a little hard to follow at times."
4,Princess castle.,"My daughter received this for Christmas. She was very excited. This castle is huge!!! It wasnt that bad to put together, as it basically comes in one whole peice, just need to do a few little things. I was a little disappointed because a peice came broken, and the legs on the table are very wobbly and fall out, some of the other peices are loose too.All in all this is adorable and we all enjoy it!"
2,"Great Concept, Not So Great Quality","I was skeptical of making the purchase after reading the review about the quality and after receiving the produtct, I have to agree. I can't believe that Disney would allow their name to be put on such a cheaply made product.A few small parts were broken when we opened the box, the doors, the side wall and the table legs easily fall off during play.I just thank God that we didn't spend the $90-$100 that the stores were asking for or the $134 that Amazon has it listed for now!"
4,Fun Princess Doll House!,"I was fortunate enough to purchase this castle at a significant discount during the holiday season. With that discount, it was really a great value. The castle, like most of the plastic toys today, is not that durable but is pretty good when compared to similar products. It has many rooms and lots of furniture and is much larger than I expected. It has a bathroom with clawfoot tub, chandelier, two bedrooms, living room, and dining room as well as a working elevator. It also has a balacony and terrace on the top.My girls, 5 and 2, really love playing with it! They also like that they can close it up completely when they're no longer playing with it. It is our second Disney princess dollhouse and definitely better than the first (the Cinderella castle) since it is so much larger with so much more furniture.Even at the full retail price, I would have still been very pleased. It's a great doll house!"
4,a little disappointed,"I bought this castle for my 3 year daughter, for Christmas. I was so excited for her. When I opened it the floor was cracked in 2 places. The box didn't seem damaged at all. I almost returned it but, she was already so happy and she didn't notice so I kept it. I just never would expect this from a brand new toy, if it was used, okay, I wouldn't be suprised. Well, I will hesitate next time before I order something."
4,A Dubious Mom is Pleased,"Having purchased many Barbie related products that were not especially durable for the cost of the item, I was dubious when my daughter wanted the Enchanted Castle more than breath itself. After finding a discount on Amazon - I gave in - and was pleasently surprised. She is thrilled. It seems more durable and well made than most Barbie products and is has lots of possiblities for imaginative play. It came with lots of furniture & accessories to play with. There are lots of nooks & crannies to play in and it folds up to a reasonable size."
4,BAD Begining GREAT ENDING!,"It showed at my home and as my daughter and I walked up from the truck BAM it was right in front of her sitting in front of the front door....I was speachless...I tried to tell her it is the next door neighbors but I don't think she will buy it....She is only four 1/2 and she just asked Santa for it on the 9th of Dec. I was sooooooooo upset it was sent this way and That she seen it! I complained to amazon and got a full refund so now I have to find her something else and save this for her birthday in july!!!!!!UPDATE!I did not want to wait until her birthday in July to find out something was wrong with it after reading some of the reviews so I took it to my moms where we opened it up and put it all together ( It was PERFECT)!The fact that it comes with furniture is a huge plus,The doorbell rings, The clock chimes and the elevator plays music, Also NONE of the pieces were broken and everthing seemed to be there. I can hardly wait until her Birthday to give it to her!"
4,My daughter says it's her favorite...,"My daughter (3) absolutely loved this castle. She has played with it every day since Christmas. The fact that it comes with furniture is a huge plus. Also the doorbell rings, the clock chimes and the elevator plays music. She loves it. One of the pieces was broken, however, I just superglued it. I did not think that returning it for something that small was worth it, since I was lucky to get it at a sale price. If your daughter loves Disney princesses, she will love this house."
3,lots of fun but poor quality,"I purchased this castle for my daughter for christmas. She loves the castle despite the poor quality of the product. The castle came with the top edgings broken off and the elevator did not work. My daughter just thought it came from the misfit island so she still plays with it every day. Would not recommend paying full price but your little princess would still love playing with this castle,"
4,My twins love this castle,"I try to by all of my expensive toys at Amazon because if you look hard enough you can find a good deal. Despite the negative reviews, this toy is worth it just for the fun the girls have playing with it. Nothing came broken. For smaller children it is a good idea to glue all the small pieces together because they do come apart easily and then they don't get lost."
5,Mother Of a 3 Year Old,"I purchased 2 of these. One for my daughter and one for my niece. They both arrived in a timely fashion and the boxes were in good condition. This is huge. It does fold up for easy storage, but it's still pretty big. Comes with lots of accessories. My daughter and niece love this. They have had no problems at all. Everything is very sturdy and stays together. Very easy to put together. I would highly recommend this. Oh, like everyone else said it does ship in it's original box. So if this is to be a gift you will really need to watch for it so you can hide it."
3,UNIVERSAK HAMMOCK STAND,This stand appears to be sturdy and is super easy to set up. The hammock I originally had on it would cause the whole stand to tip over in a moderate wind (10 mph). It would probably be more suitable for a string/rope hammock that did not have so much wind resistance. The jury is still out on how it holds up being out in the damp southeast Texas weather.
1,Too small for a standard hammock,"This stand did not work with our single-person woven hammock (see pictures). The dimensions were too short and not long enough to support a person off the ground. (And are not listed on the product detail online.) The stand was also easy to accidentally tip backwards, and even side to side when getting into the hammock. Very sturdy construction, and very easy to put together, but it was a disappointing summer morning to climb in and wind up sitting on the ground in the hammock. It may work fine for other types of hammocks, but was a definite failure for ours."
1,Not what I expected...,"Pros-Really, really big (good if you have a giant hammock and/or are a bigger person)-GF had lots of fun watching me struggle with its assembly (had to get into many unorthodox positions to attempt this [unsuccessfully])Cons-Really, really, really big stand (much bigger than my standard size hammock)-Cheap, metal pieces did not fit together at all (some too loose, others too tight)-Experienced an array of frustration and rage in trying to put it together-Having to ship it back for a refund"
1,What a waste,"First they advertized no shipping then they added shipping. Second it is not level on a flat deck. It requires a 1"" under one of the 4 places it is supposed to hit the floor. And last it tips over in the event you get too high or low in the hammock. No, I never contacted the company. You asked, Thanks, Lloy"
1,Don't waste your money,"We bought this hammock to replace a hammock that we loved that had been munched on by mice. This hammock was reasonably priced, so we bought it - and after trying it w/ our young and very lightweight daughter - promptly threw it out. It's loosely constructed with very little support and not comfortable at all. Don't waste your money!"
1,very poor quality product & packaging--sent it back,"1. hammock stand couldn't be assembled--pipes were askew, so the pieces couldn't all be joined2. poor design--the connections lacked a locking feature(note the reviewer who said they come apart easily when moving the stand)3. box was filled with pulverized styrofoam pieces which made a huge mess(not packing peanuts; the tiny balls that come from disintegrated styrofoam--they got everywhere and were a pain to clean up)I was looking forward to using this product, and haven't been more disappointed with an Amazon purchase than this. I think this is my first product review, and I've been shopping Amazon for years. I returned it--which was easy, UPS picked it up and I was fully refunded--kudos to Amazon.I ended up with a different model:Bliss Small Hammock Stand. It was a breeze to assemble and had minimal and sufficient paper packing material. Save your time and energy for something you care about."
2,BUYERS BEWARE ON SIZE,"Bought this Texsport Padre Island Hammock stand for my in laws for Christmas. They were delightful to receive it as my mother in law has been wanting a hammock for a while. I chose this because of the size stated it's 136 inch long which would make a good match for a hammock we also bought for them.To our disappointment, the description was misleading. The size is indeed 136 inch long but what the description didn't tell me is that it will only FIT UP TO 120 inch hammock! The hammock we bought ended up too long and when you're on it, your behind will touch the floor.My father in law informed me that when they assembled this stand, some parts didn't match perfectly. Either too loose or too tight that he'd have to rig it to make it fit if they were to keep this hammock stand.Amazon was great at giving me a full refund though.Texsport, please update the description! I uploaded a picture so other customers wouldn't be fooled like I did."
3,Second Time is the Charm?,"After getting an entire kit that didn't go together (How can you make 6 poles that don't fit together?? That is all the kit is, for goodness sake!) Amazon sent a perfectly fine replacement and then picked up the old one. The one that fit together is just fine as that is all it is - 6 poles that can hold a hammock. It sounds flimsy, but it doesn't fall over if you sit in it correctly. Cheap price for a reason. Thank you Amazon support!"
1,Don't do it!,"This stand is chintzy at best. There is no hardware to hold the parts in place and it literally falls over when the wind blows. I have put it back together more times than I can count. The final straw is having is collapse underneath you. Right now it's being used just to hold my very nice hammock (folded over on itself, one side of the stand, because otherwise the wind would just blow it over and I'm sick of cleaning my nice hammock). In the week or so that I've had it ""stored"" as it is, the frame has literally bent under the weight of just the hammock. It's the worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon. I thought if I got a nice hammock and an ""ok"" frame, I'd still be making a good purchase. I was wrong. The stand is just as important (or more so)."
3,hard to find a fitting hammock,"Stand is fine, but it's hard to find a hammock that fits this stand. I've already bought 3 and had to send the first 2 back. I gave up after the third and kept it even though it sits 4 inches above the ground."
3,Final thought: Eh,"For the price I guess this thing is ok. Its kinda flimsy, a pain in the rear to setup by yourself and it won't for the life of ya have all 4 legs in the ground without weight on it. It will also only keep you about an inch off the ground at the highest."
1,protection....but no reception,"I got this case to protect my phone on the farm around the tractors and all....but the problem is that I get no reception using it. We live far enough out that I normally only get three bars or less without a case, but with this case on I can never get more then a bar and usually not even that. To answer a call I have to take it out of the case, and that is if I'm lucky and just touching it with the case on doesn't make it drop the call with the tiny bit of interference my hand makes."
5,Many of his best stories,"45 short stories by the brilliant satirist, famous in Russia but almost completely forgotten in his native country. Unfortunately, my favorite story of his, ""Watchbird"", is not there. I once stepped into a discussion in the Russophone blogosphere about whether the indigenous population of Kosovo are the Serbs or the Albanians. I noted that no anatomically modern humans are indigenous to Europe since we all came from Africa. The story ""Sarkanger"" makes it clear that wild cabbage predates both the Albanians and the Serbs."
3,Not what I expected,"This book was not what I expected when I read somebodies recommedation for it. It was presented to me as though Sheckley was an icon of early scifi. Maybe he was, but scifi in it's early stages must have been alot different. The collection of stories were all satirical and silly. They were like watching an episode of ""My Favorite Martian"" as far as seriousness. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy comedic stories, but I uess this just wasn't my style. Others may enjoy it though"
4,A good reference for contemporary projects,"Useful in assessing what styles should be considered and what it takes to create them. Also, the introduction is instrumental in deciding what window treatment should be selected based on certain criteria such as light, view, energy efficiency, etc. As noted by other reviewers, instructions are too vague to use as the only source of reference unless you have prior expereience in making window treatments. I would purchase this book again."
5,the worst book on the subject I've ever seen,"the instructions are so badly phrased and illustrated, it's next to useless. I am an experienced sewer, have made lots of draperies, just needed a refresher, and instructions on interlining. There are no instructions on interlining, and the language of instruction is so inexact I simply can't figure out what she's talking about. Same for the illustrations, and I'm a artist (painter) who reads engineering drawings as easily as written language. The least of the faults of this book is that it gives no basic overview of what's possible, and the esthetic exercised is ... well, irrelevant to mine. By the way, I have constructed clothing for fashion shows for pattern companies here in New York."
5,Old time fave!,"I ordered this Barbie because I thought it was different, boy oh boy was I surprised, another beautiful Barbie!"
4,Nice Doll,Very nice doll and detailed. Love the pearl necklace and 1920's style outfit. Really nice addition to my Barbie collection!
5,This text is invaluable,"I'm currently using this book as a supplemental text for my paramedic training. We've just finished cardiology, and I couldn't have done it without this text. I already owned Phalen, Dubin, and Huff; all are good, but the Huszar text is now the one I go to first when I have a question about ECG's. There are a multitude of practical illustrations, tables, and review questions. Best of all is the 200-and-some strips for practice in the appendix. Highly recommend!!"
5,Awesome,Came fast! A girl in my class ordered the same book waaaaay before me and I got mine before she did. It was exactly how it was described. Thanks!
4,Concise Introduction to Win32 System Programming,"I enjoyed reading this book. I liked the comparisons with Unix, and I especially liked the conciseness and value for money (too many Windows books are too thick and overpriced).The web page supporting the book is outstanding and the author is very responsive to feedback.Having said that I enjoyed the conciseness, I'm looking forward to a second edition with more detail and examples (on I/O completion ports, for instance).I thoroughly recommend this book as good value for money; I'm sure you'll find the time to read it from cover to cover."
5,Fits perfectly within a niche readership.,"A book that does not try to be a ""jack of all trades"" but sets out to give an experienced UNIX (system) programmer a good grounding in Win32 with enough detail to write useful code. I was very pleased to find this book after searching through the morass of GUI/OOP/""Hello world"" publications that had little or no real content."
5,Very pleased,"This item works great with easy setup and did I mention it works great. I guess if I have any questions, it would be can they make it a little smaller as it is kind of chunky."
5,Great remote,Works perfectly second one puurchased from this seller( one for each roommate) love them also they have a decent distance they work in
3,Wireless cameras,"Arrived in good time, in new condition. Unfortunately, this wireless set and my wireless N-router conflict with each each! Otherwise, this is a good set, I am sure I just need to work out the kinks. I like that you can hook up for 4 cameras to one monitor, and the receiver will cycle through the different cameras hooked up at short intervals. Cameras have sound as well, fairly clear picture."
4,Works fairly well,Pros - It works right away once you set up your code to match your receiver which is not hard to do. Just some pin switches. It is a little bulky which in my case is good so it won't get lost too easy. I get teased once in a while for having a garage door opener straight out of the 1980's. They should have upgraded the shell to look more modern.Cons - Seems to gradually lose range as the battery wears down. After about a year having to drive to about a car length away to open the door on the first attempt. Don't know if this is the case with all transmitters but wanted to point this out. I use an alkaline battery and open and close the door twice a day on average.
3,Works ok.,"I found myself having to find the signal between it and my gate controller, which sometimes took up to a minute of repeatedly clicking to get them to recognize each other. Could have been my batters but I doubt it, they were just regular batteries so it should've worked fine. All in all though, I was never in an emergency to get in or anything, so clicking a couple of times was no biggy, and the clip on the back of it allowed me to never lose it because I could just put it on my visor."
2,Misleading entry,"This CD only contains highlights of the original 2 CD album. If you look very carefully at the album picture you will see this, but the description doesn't make this very clear! The contents are ""The Eve of the War"", ""Horsell Common and the Heat Ray"", ""Forever Autumn"", ""The Fighting Machine"", ""The Red Weed"", ""The Spirit of Man"", ""Dead London"", ""Brave New World"" Bonus tracks are remixes of ""The Eve of the War"" and ""Forever Autumn""Comparing the times on this CD and the original it appears that pretty much every track has been edited.So beware if you are looking for a complete album; this is not it!"
2,Very poor text book,"I'm in a MSW program and this text book was part of the reading material. For a text book, its poorly written. The book jumps from topic to topic and does not have a clear flow from one subject to anouther. Items are misplaced and the information is difficult to find. In my class of 25 student there was no one who was happy with this book."
1,Needs an editor,"I had the misfortune of having to read this book in a Human Development course. This textbook is wordy, redundant, and overflowing with irrelevant detail. The writing is incomprehensible. There is a crippling lack of focus which defeats the purpose of any text--to guide a student through relevant material. A good editor would have rejected this book outright, or at least have gotten out a big pack of red pens!"
4,Needs Information,"I bought an old wood stove with the name SPENCE, BAGGS & CO. written at the back below and the words PRIZE FRANKLIN written at front. Anyone have knowledge about this?"
4,Cool little chair!,"This little chair may appear small, but the comfort is big. It is low to the ground which allows you to stretch your legs out without the need of an ottoman. I also found it ideal for sitting in when playing guitar. The assembly can be a bit awkward, but once you get it together, it's solid. My 5 year old daughter especially likes it, her own personal carousel,she just spins and spins. I got the black leather and chrome one, but they have other colors and materials too."
3,ok,"They were a little loose with our vaccuum, but they did work. I guess if they were a bette fit, even though it said it would fit our machine."
2,wrong size,"it didn't fit my machine . even though the instructions said it was the right size, got it somewhere else"
4,Met my needs.,The belts were delivered in the mail on time and in good shape. After installation the belt has functioned perfectly and I have a spare belt for future use.
2,Probably the last one...,"Sorry to say, this one really didn't make the cut (actually it did, I cut it out of my collection quick!). The first one was the best, the second one cool too, they at least concentrated on the mood and atmosphere more. This one? Got a couple of yawns, fast forwards, skips, and eject. OM is having writer's block."
4,Not bad at all,"To be sure, the only other Naked Music Recordings that I've listened to in their entirety are Nude Dimensions 2, Carte Blanche 2, and Carte Blanche 3 so any comparisons that I make will be to these mixes. I have trouble seeing where people find Nude Dimensions 2 to be a better compilation that ND3. Sure, no track on ND3 really touches Cooly's Hot Box's ""Could You Love Me"" or Aquanote's amazing ""True Love,"" but I feel this compliation does have it's own gems (Rain, Blue Six Tribute, Love Yourself). In addition, I feel this compliation features better track mixing than ND2 or Carte Blanche 3. This has become one of my favorite CD's for driving, in-house lounging, and guest-entertaining background music. Fans of ND2, CB2, or CB3 will be pretty happy with this purchase (in my opinion). Outstanding mix minus one star for a few semi-duds in between."
4,Get's you movn' then keeps you groovn',"I really do not understand the bad vibes this cd is getting. This cd by far is the bets out of the three. Just because it is not as predictable as the last two, does not make it a bad cd. I like cd's that are varied especially house cd's, as house can get really boring and repetitive. I found that out when i went and saw Mr. Migs live. This is as smooth as the last two, but with a greater edge, its dark and tribal with tracks like Ever after love and the Blue six tribute. It is able to hold its true ethos right through the compilation, whilst attempting to bring of the blinkers and expose its listner to new sounds. Is'nt that really what music and compilations all about, education and expositionto music. If you want a straight house cd, grab the first two, but if you like variations to a groove, you cannot go past this one.Also check out the Standard Room Service cd's for some education in groove."
3,"Good, but not the best compilation.","You have to give the Naked crew credit though for producing a very well mixed cd. If anything, buy it to listen to the transitions, they're solid! Sexy beats, sultry tracks...those descriptions, if you're familiar with them, will help you understand this cd. It's smooth deep house. Notable tracks:RainStep into the lightOnly 2? Well, I know, but those are the BEST according to my ears. The other tracks are good but the cd might sound a little repetitive once you get to the 9th or 10th track. Listen to the tracks and make up your own mind. All in all, I doubt you'll be disappointed."
1,Very Dissapointing!!!,"Wow,I hate to say it but I am Extremly Dissapointed with this CD. I have been a very big fan of the Nude Dimensions Series, however this new installment just dosen't measure up. I think anyone that has ever bought vols. 1 or 2 would be just as dissapointed. When you think of Nude Dimensions, you think of Deep, Soulfoul, Sensual and Exotic afterhours house music. This CD still has a little bit of the Sensuality, however whats missing is the Soulful Vocals as well as the Mesmerizing Deep Melodies that were on volumes 1 & 2. Naked Music says that they wanted to take a different direction with this volume and that they did........the highway to Distruction! If this is the new direction, they'll never have to worry about me buying anymore CD's from them because this CD really [is bad]....Big Time!"
5,Appalachian Traditions,"This book is as good as it gets!! Lesa Postell is an amazing lady, that shares her ancestors ways of preserving food. I use this book very often, and let me tell you, she is right on the money with what she tells you. She brings the ways out, in a way you can understand,and it makes you feel that you are,and were there. If you follow her advice, you can preserve food the way it use to be done, and the right way. Throw all of your other books on preserving food away!! You just struck gold with this lady!!!!"
5,Best Medical Micro Text Ever-Reads Like a Good Novel!,"I teach microbiology to nursing students, so I only use this book as a reference. It's a wonderful book; I take it to bed with me and don't fall asleep (really). The information is comprehensive without being unnecesarily difficult, and the organization and presentation are so intuitive, it seems to answer your next question before you even formulate it. My only gripe is WHERE IS THE NEW EDITION??? Even though this book is old, 1998, it's still worth the money, but it doesn't have the new emergent diseases like TSE and SARS."
4,Inspiring account of a man behind the scenes,"As a medical student at the Johsn Hopkins University School of Medicine, I found it absolutely facinating to peer into the life of a man who worked side by side with Dr. Blalock to help develop some of the most important advances in surgery of the 20th century. I have seen the portrait that Mr. Thomas describes in the book still hanging in the atrium of the Blalock elevators. I recommend this book to anyone interested in medical or surgical history."
5,Great movie,This HBO movie was very well done and the story of Vivien and his contribution to medicine is one that should be told much more often! I had never heard of him before this movie came out. That is such a shame!
5,Partners of the Heart,"I received this beautiful book from my husband as a birthday gift. I had bought the movie years ago and have shown it to so many people...it touches hearts (literally!). I am glad to have the book but have not started reading it yet...I will get back to you on it, but I know it will be a touching memoir."
3,Vivien Thomas,Book arrived quickly and in good shape. The book contains many highly technical surgical passages which do not lend themselves to easy reading. Unless you have a medical background these passages can be overwhelming. Most readers will probably end up skipping these passages which comprise a large portion of the book.
1,not usable,"This cd features very restrictive copy protection, rending me unable to access the tracks on it. At all. I cannot play this C.D. on any equipement I own."
1,Short Story of Morbid Fey Boy Drawn Out for 700 Extra Pages,"This is the worst thing Dostoevsky ever wrote. Prince Myushkin was an adorable figure, but without a plot, who cares? This book was obviously written for serial publication with Dostoevsky being paid by the word."
2,APPLE LOVER IN AGONY,"Stop, don't do it, don't get one. I waited two weeks and now in misery. If you are a manic Apple lover and obsessed with font clarity and spacing you will HATE this machine. The LCD screen makes all fonts under 12 a blur.Ten point is completely unreadable. Appleworks 6 makes each page 92% of its true size. NO MORE WYSIWYG. It's agony. All cute and sleek and fun, yes, it is. Fast too. AND YOU CAN'T USE IT if you do any real graphic design. DON'T GET ONE! And stock up on the old ones instead."
2,Missing a lot of the recipes from the restaurant,I got this book in the hopes to have some of the recipes for the restaurant. It had at most one or two.
5,Personal Favourite,"I always have this record stand by for any moment, it is great. It is diverse and stylish with some great and unlikely music choices. To me it also is a great companion to the sets of James Zabiela."
4,Very nice for the price,"I picked one of these up on closeout from BudK and found it to be very nice for the price. The heft felt good and the construction seemed solid. The mirror polishing was fair, certainly not the best I've seen. I would have like to have seen something in the end of the scabbard to steady the blade when inserted fully."
3,Handy to Carry,This is a very nice table top grill to have. I find that it can be a bit difficult to get the coals going. I guess it has to do with the design of the bottom as the airflow can be restricted if the coals is not strategically positioned in the bin.
4,An Important Piece to the Puzzle,"Don't let negative critics scare you from reading this book. Read this unique perspective to a complicated relationship involving religious dogma and secular factions within Israel and the US to assist your understanding of the larger picture. The author's research and opinions are not designed to support the proposition that settlements are collectively an ""empire"". His conclusion is simple: the settlements and the ideology supporting them are a significant aspect of Israeli politics and driving the scope of the relationship with the US, Pal Authority, etc."
3,A Rearly Discussed but Relevant Topic,"The Accidental Empire seeks to explain how Israeli settlements were created. The author uses a great deal of relevant sources, inclusding some archive sources. It is a well-written and easy to read book.I would, however, object its heavy ideological anti-Zionist leftist bias, present at almost every page. A main premise of this work is that Jewish presence in the West Bank is unjust/unjustifiable, and that settlements are an expression of imperialism. At the same time, the author, to his credit, does not omit historical, strategic, military and other aspects of Jewish connection to the land, which speak to the contrary of the mentioned premise.This book explores an issue rarely discussed in the historical studies of Israel and the Middle East. Its historical value is undiniable, but it should be red with caution, avoiding ideological traps."
4,Brief Look at Love and Transformation,"Jane Alison's novel, The Love Artist, takes a little that is known and a lot that is unknown concerning the writer Ovid and his banishment from ancient Rome and creates a beautifully written tale of love and transformations. The character of Xenia, a woman both from, but not of, the Black Sea area is the personality that the story revolves around. She is like Ovid's writing come to life and she inspires him to greater heights. The author makes this ancient world come alive and is successful in fashioning breathing personalities for both Ovid and Xenia. The story, though, at times feels like a novella and the fascinating character of Julia, the emperor's grand-daughter (who will share a fate with Ovid) sometimes seems lost behind the two major characters when she should have been given a little more space. That aside, this is a pleasant, sweetly-voiced novel about a man who will live forever."
2,"Beautiful writing, yet a bit confusing...","The book starts off with the poet Ovid's being sent to exile in the first century A.D. Rome. Why could this extremely popular poet have done to cause the Emperor to send him away? The author spins a tale of a man looking for inspiration, who believes he has found it in a woman named Xenia, whom he meets on holiday by the Black Sea. Xenia returns to Rome with Ovid, becoming his muse and lover. When Ovid gains the Emperor's granddaughter as a patron for his newest (and he believes best work), lies and jealous thoughts starts to tear Ovid and Xenia apart. The writing captures you and takes you straight to the streets of Rome and into the lives of Ovid and Xenia. Yet, a couple of times I felt a bit lost, for the writing was a bit vague, and left things to the reader's imagination."
2,A noble attempt at explaning a classical author..,"I wanted to like Jane Alison's ""Love Artist"". I really wanted to see if she could bring new life into the story of Ovid. Well, she didn't, and I was left feeling confused and a bit hallow. In this tale, Ovid meets an unusual ""sorceress"" named Xenia, and they fall in love, and he brings her back from the Black Sea coast to his Rome, where ""Metamorphosis"" has just came out. There, Ovid gains the patroonship of Augustus's only granddaughter, who dispises her grandfather so much she aborts a pregnancy, thus robbing him of heirs. Anyway, parts of the book are quite erotic, but I don't quite understand how it ended badly for them. Alison is too vague mostly, and this detracts from the story."
2,A Good Story,"I really enjoyed The Love-Artist. Well researched and beautifully written, it provides an entertaining look at the events that might have inspired Ovid's poetry and his exile, but it also falls short of being a great book. The mystery of Ovid's exile makes an enthralling narrative engine, and the language recreates Ancient Roman and the wonder and magic of the age. That's great, but it is also disappointing, as Ms. Alison seems to be capable of much more. Talented beyond story-telling, she is capable of creating great literature. Next time, I hope Alison aspires to do just that."
3,ummm. alright if you have a systum,Well it okay if you already have a system we did not so we heard no dial tone and we returned the company telephone king was very helpful.
5,Perfect Travel Mirror,"Perfect, lightweight, and easy to pack. Great for traveling with friends and family. It's like having an extra bathroom mirror."
2,meh... range is aweful.,"VERY poor range. They work, but I have to literally hold it up to the door window to get it to work, almost easier to just use manual key."
5,Colin hits the Big Time- Broadway,"Colin Quinn is arguably the greatest comic working today. This show is the culmination of all of his hard work and comic brilliance. Often dismissed as a has-been from his Remote Control days and Tough Crowd (hugely underrated and misunderstood show he hosted on Comedy Central; unique in every way), Long Story Short was his redemption. He started out in underground theater and then transferred it to Broadway with big production values (for a one-man show). Colin's grasp on various specific accents is incredible, not the typical, stock voices comics do to mimic certain races and ethnicities.Buy it."
5,Best Computer I have ever owned!,"I have never worked on a mac prior to purchasing my new iMac. I bought it primarily for converting home videos to dvd. I have attempted this on my pc and have failed miserably. Constant crashes and lockups. I have taken a chance on the iMac and boy am I impressed. I have, in a 4 days, created two dvd movies that play incredible on my big screen tv. This was just the begining. I receieve e-mail, fax, web browsing, quicken, ms office, mp3, the flat screen, ethernet port, 5 usb ports, 2 firewire ports, etc... The software is incredible and it runs beautifully.Also I am a web developer and creating java applications is awesome. I have now had my machine on for 3 straight weeks, it has only crashed once, when I put a program I wrote in an endless loop. I will never buy another windows based pc. If you used an iMac for a weekdend, you would never buy a windows pc either."
1,Love the imac hate the red dot in the middle of my screen,"I got my new iMac a week ago today. I am a long time PC user but I love the way this Mac looks and works. Yes it takes a little translation of terms and there is a learning curve to make things work but it all works really well -EXCEPT!!!!!! After three days of using the computer a little red dot showed up in the very middle of the screen as well as in the left hand corner, it is a pixel anomoly, meaning a sub pixel of a pixel is stuck on in red. I contacted Apple support immediately and had even purchased the Apple Care protection program. They emailed me a very vague document basically saying the that it was impossible to build a perfect LCD screen without it costing to much for consumer production and that mine did not even warrant an evaluation much less replacement or repair. In others words tough luck...."
4,WOW,"Have not used one yet but, WOW. The features are amazing. DVD burner, G4 Chip, and LCD screen. Why buy the G4 tower that costs so much more. New iMac does it all. Can't wait to try one out!"
1,"Too slow and too temperamental, finicky about hardware","I bought an IMAC (OS X version 10.1.4, power PC G4 processor)three months ago. The graphics are beautiful, the sound is good, but unless one wants to look at pictures and listen to music, it is probably the wrong machine. It is very, very slow to respond. And it has great difficulty with hardware. In fact, it is incompatible with much of the hardware with which it supposed to be compatible. I have tried two different printers--and because of review guidelines on Amazon I cannot mention their names, and if you have ever been frustrated by trying to get two machines to talk to each other, multiply that frustration by 100 or 1000 and you will have the IMAC experience. The IMAC also works very poorly with at least one very popular Internet server, and again, since I cannot mention the name because of Amazon review guidelines, you will have to make a good inference."
2,Nice computer but overpriced,"I am one of the few that doesn't think this computer is ugly. I do agree that it is overpriced for what you get. If the video card wasn't years out of date I would give it 3-4 stars. Sadly the GF2MX isn't powerful enough to run any of the new games in the store, so I can't reccomend this system. However I don't think any other computer looks as wild. I don't care if most people think its ugly, I love the whole retro 80's desk-lamp thing."
3,More for people that are familiar with the Language...,"I am currently using this book in my College French101 Class. The only problem that I have with this book is that the instructions (for the activities)are in french, so to know what you are supposed to do you must look up every word you don't know, which (if you are a beginner) is most of them!"
5,Smooth ride,"It comes to me as no surprise that Naked Music is in the forefront of Deep House music. Thier productions fill every respectable DJ's record bags. This CD takes you from sultry vocals to deeper, bootyshaking house tracks.Standout tracks ""The Limit"" and ""Got 2 B u"" All in all, this CD is beautiful all the way through. The grand finale is Lisa Shaw's ""Always,"" one of the best vocal house tracks, ever. Excellent job and a very smooth ride."
1,Mind Numbing Monotony,"I'm completely baffled by this disc. Every track (and I mean every track) has the exact same monotonous beat (thump thump thump). Almost no melody, very little vocals, maybe an occasional note from a bass. All the tracks are almost wholly indistinguishable. Without looking at the track number while playing you would think they cloned all the tracks from the same 5 minutes of drum machine beat. Were *any* artists involved with this or did they just turn on the drum machine for the length of the disc? I guess you could dance to this the same way you could dance to a metronome. I like chill, I like lounge, but this disc is just a bad joke (on the purchaser)."
1,a continuous mix of the same monotonous beat...,"...i tried, i really, really tried....(the good news is that every six or seven minutes they throw an interesting vocal in the mix...just enough to keep you from slammin your head into somethin blunt!!)"
5,Changes Your Life!,"Press repeat, spread your wings and fly away!!!(Use Headphones!). Deep as deep can get. Soulful, sexy, extremely recreational, groovy but not at all a stupid one. I'm afraid it's gonna take a while to find another one like this. Thanks to Bruno Ybarra from Naked Music and Mauricio Aviles for the Mixing."
4,Heavy rotation!,"I made out like a bandit with this cd. Until recently, the label and the dj (Mauricio Aviles) were unknown to me. However, any cd featuring 'Atjazz' in the lineup has got to flow. If you like deep, smooth house then you will relate to this mix! It is mellow but the beats are strong. The remix version of MJ Cole's 'Sincere' is as wicked as they come! It is always nice to have a good source of deep house mixes. I trust that the Nude Dimension series won't disappoint the masses!**Watson**"
4,Top Book - too focussed on kids,"I really like this book, and the others in this series that I have used.It's drawback though is that it is VERY aligned to writing reports for children and could have included more examples of adult reporting."
4,Essentials of Assessment Report Writing,"This book provides what it promises plus gives value for money. Like other titles in the series, it suits the approach of reading the entire text and then marking specific pages for later reference.I purchased it from Amazon.com after searching the tables of contents and several other pages. When it arrived I was pleased to find that all sections of the book contained sound professional advice, good writing, and in-depth coverage.The authors show an appreciation of differences in reporting styles that are linked to the type and purpose of an assessment. The book clarifies the over-riding need to present information clearly and concisely within sections that enable readers to access information and understand the assessor's interpretation of a client's scores, responses and behaviours."
5,Great book for you School Psych students,"Report writing after administering a test is tricky. The wording can be tricky. This books helps explain what parents want to hear and how to write it. Every test is different, therefore every report is different. This book explains how to write it properly, without skipping anything significant. Great book."
4,Okay Book,"To be honest I still haven't been able to really implement this book as I prepare assessments, but the book itself is full of good information to help with documentation."
1,False portrayal,"I ordered a blue pond spitter, the spitter was not blue but brown. The merchant said, when I spoke with him something like, ""well, that's the picture supplied by the supplier."" NOT true, the supplier's catalog, provided bt the merchant, shows the fish spitter brown. I asked for a refund of postage paid to deliver the misrepresented spitter. It was falsely presented. I'm out the postage to return the item, also out the postage I paid when I ordered the fish, $19 + another $11. I explained to them my bird bath concrete bowl is blue, the stand, concrete, is blue, which is why I ordered a BLUE SPITTER. The spitter is BROWN!!! THE BASIC ERROR, COLOR, WAS THEIR ERROR, NOT MINE!"
4,Not the most impressive Geotrax piece.,"My kids and I were pretty excited about this addition to the Geotrax set, at Christmas. It turns out, it's pretty frustrating.Like other reviewers have said, the turntable doesn't work all that well with multiple car trains. Then, when it's set for the train to drive on through without stopping, the trains sometimes get hung up on the ""climbing"" mechanism.This particular addition takes up ALOT of space. While it's still connected to our geotrax set, I'm just not impressed with it's function. We have lots of other sets that are much better additions. This one just frustrated my kids, with not being able to turn around once in the ""stall""."
3,looks very cute but not very functional,"I just got the whole set of geotrax and really think they look great and way cheaper than Thomas however the round housecan only hold one train at a time so it derails the train if you have more than one locomotive. they really need to add the reverse as well so they kids and me ( mom ) LOL can really make use of all the options. However, overall I really love this toy but yes I had to convert my office room into the Geotrax room. be ready to do this if not stick to the basic set up. Its very hard though since it all is so cool"
1,Not worth it,"I wish I hadn't paid the money for this one. It only works in certain directions, its more of a pain than it is fun. I don't recommend adding it to your collection. There are plenty of other FUN accessories that you could buy instead."
2,Geo Trax Round House,"While the concept of this item is cool, it is not very functional. It will turn with the train on it but not if the train has cars hooked to it. If you have cars hooked to the train then it is pointless and frustrating. Also the trains do not go in reverse so if you are using the remote control trains then it is really a waste."
2,Invest in a different GeoTrax set,"In general, I LOVE the GeoTrax trains, and rate them 5 stars, overall. But this Roundhouse is a major disappointment. Some details are listed in another review - but that reviewer didn't think the problems were such a big deal... I do. Major problems are:- They didn't make the modules interchangeable with other tracks. This means it is not nearly as versatile as other GeoTrax. You have no option to connect other tracks to the 'spokes' of the roundhouse.- You need to manually turn the trains around once they go in for their wash or gas.- Only one train car fits on the thing that goes around, so it doesn't work when cars are attached to the engine. This is the biggest and most frustrating problem. You need to unhoook your train engine from its cars and fool around with everything.- It is just TOO BIG and that makes it hard to store.We will be getting rid of ours..."
1,Useless product,"I bought the scoop and bags mostly for the bags being earth friendly. The bags are too small, sure they fit the scoop, but my cat pees all in one corner so the clump can get huge. Therefore won't fit in this narrow bag just wide enough for the scoop itself.The scoop itself is ok, but I still have my old scoop and I prefer it because the litter flows throw my old scoop better than this one.Bottom line: if you have a cat that makes just small to mediuim sized clumps, then this product might be ok. I personally find no value in having the bags inside the hande of the scoop. In fact I think the feel of the scoop is cumbresone."
4,good idea,"I like that these litter bags are a green product and will break down in the landfill. My only dislike is the bags are narrow in size. I use a bag lined coffee can to collect the soiled litter in. With two cats I have to scoop at least once, sometimes twice, a day. When it's full, I pull the bag and dispose in the garbage. These bags aren't wide enough to secure over the container. Otherwise, they are great."
4,"Prima's D. Crisis, another great Prima guide","prima hasnt let me down yet. i dont use strategy guides much(every 9th game or so), but when i do i use prima. they r great help in the ""impossible"" situations. go prima!"
4,Dining with Dinos,"Book is sweet as, with everything that you could possibly want to kno about the game in it. buy it and dont play without it and if you dont have the game, then get off your arse and get it fattys.......its a killer of a game and way better than resident evil"
2,Not layed out well,"It had the answers, but was not easy to follow. Getting all the endings were very difficult to follow. Average strategy guide."
5,Dino crisis official guide,"I got this guide book on amazon.com from a seller for a used book. so when i got the package on march 26, 2009 took look at book was in very good condition it has all pages and it have everything for what was include in guide book so thats very good but condition says like new. so i look at the front cover there was like the front cover was cut by little on the corner but that doesn't matter. i'm glad i got the book beause i miss playing dino crisis its a very good game..."
5,Linda Eder Beware- She's Back and Brillant,"If you don't like classical scores , then this is not the cd for you. But, if you do and you LOVE Linda Eder like I do, then you will be pleasantly surprised . You are in for a delightful treat as Eder takes on the role of Wendy.Though she only sings 5 songs, she make a tremendous impact on this recording.Her voice goes to new high as she shows off her lyrical soprano voice. You clearly hear the infulence of opera star Eileen Farrell in her register.This recording will showcase what a versatile performer she is."
5,pleasently suprised,i was unaware of this l. bernstein score. Linda eder is always wonderful so I ordered the CD. It is most enjoyable and I am happy to have it in my collection
4,Wonderful Rare Musical Theatre Gem,A beautiful little known musical theatre gem. Even Linda Eder haters will love this CD. She fortunately left her American Idol stylings at home...
1,nice to have.,"It completes my collection of Linda Eder cd's. It is nice to own, but I like her other (solocd's) better."
4,Great truck,"I bought this truck for my 3 1/2 year old for Christmas. My wife was skeptical that he'd enjoy it, considering his fixation on Thomas, Mickey and all the other characters dominating kids' tv. Despite receiving tons of other gifts, this is his favorite. It not only looks like the real thing, it also works like the real thing. Very impressive and pretty durable."
5,Great Truck - Cab is metal not plastic like trailer,"From the other reviews, I was a little concerned because most mention ""plastic"". I was happy to see that the cab is metal. And it's HUGE! The only downside is, for the price, you would think the doors would open or a little extra detail there. But, my 6yr old son loves it! I can't wait for the rest of the vehicles (xmas gifts) to arrive. I hope I can manage to keep myself from giving them to him before then, like, I ashamed to say...I did with this one. I ordered him the cement mixer, skid steer, and truck w/conveyor belt. I'm as excited about them as I know he will be. Worth the $$$."
4,I was pleasantly surprised,"Ordered the truck at the $27.99 price, it did not take long to get here and it is a good sized truck, somewhere around 34 in long. I think my son will be pleasantly surprised for Christmas. Glad I didn't pay $60 because I'm cheap like that but at $30 you could certainly do worse."
5,My Grandson loved this toy,I purchased the Bruder flatbed truck and bulldozer through Amazon for my three year old grandson. He was very pleased with it. It is right up there at the top of the list for favorite toys since his father has a dozer and his grandfather has a tractor trailer. The toy has great detailing and seems very durable for a plastic toy. I thought I got a great deal since I did not have to pay sales tax or shipping. Have always got great value shopping through Amazon. Rose Braun
5,3 Year Old Loves This Truck!,"We purchased this truck for our son who is just turning three. We had already purchased a backhoe and a forklift, but then saw this for a super price and got it, too. First impression: This toy is huge! The truck with trailer is almost three feet long. It's mostly plastic, but seems like good quality. Wheels are good and rubbery, and the trailer even has a pair of flip-down feet near the front to support it when detached from the truck. Although not recommended, our son (37 pounds) sat on the trailer over the axles and it held him fine. He's played with it every day we've had it.Very pleased that this is NOT made in China. No worry about what's in the plastics or dyes.I don't see any significant drawbacks, except that it is so big it may be hard to find a place to put it. If you start collecting a fleet of these things, they take up a lot of room!"
4,Great truck,"I got this for my 2 year old and he soo far loves it, he does have a hard time connecting the trailer and truck but it is holding up nicely to 3 boys."
5,Construction Truck & Dozer,I bought this for my grandson for his 3rd birthday. He just loved it. His brother loved it to and wanted it. They both just loved this item.
4,3 year old boy's Birthday gift,"This was the perfect gift for our 3 year old son for his Birthday. He loves playing with it. It is very durable. However, for a 3 year old boy, it needed to be a little more durable b/c he broke some little piece off within the first week of play. I am glad I got this for a great price. I definitely hope Amazon has more Bruder toys on sale like this one because I will be a return customer. I highly recommend this as a gift. It gets played with more than some battery toy."
3,Poor quality photography reproductions,"The quality of the color separations in this book are uneven at best. Many photographs have a reddish filter, whichindicates the level of printing expertise, or maybe just trying to save some money in the process. In many photographs the colors used in the room decor fail to match the descriptive copy on the opposite page. Unfortunate, because the homes selected are of uniformly historical interest."
1,not very good,my 3yr old still sucks her finger with this stuff on. Hot sauce would have been cheaper.
2,Sappy oater for nostalgists only,"B-westerns such as Paramount's 'The Light of the Western Stars' were cranked out in the '30s and '40s like Bosco. And although this particular picture boasts the cachet of having best-selling author Zane Grey and prolific film and TV director Lesley Selander attached to it, the result really isn't any better or worse than the hundreds of other oaters produced during the period (routine storyline, cornball dialog, overtheatrical performances, bland camerawork, etc.), making for little more than a fun and forgettable 65-minute trip down nostalgia lane. The print offered on this Lionsgate DVD, while not restored to any appreciable extent and showing signs of wear throughout, is still fair to good in terms of audio and video quality. 2 stars overall."
4,The Mirror,"I read this book many years ago and it was one of my favorites. I loaned out to someone and she never returned it. She became my ""ex""-sister-in-law, so I never pursued getting it back from her. I assumed she liked it as well.Glad to have it back in my collection."
3,Romantic Satire,"Madame Bovary, I must emphasize, is not a romantic work. In fact, it is quite the satire. Emma's romantic excesses are portrayed as a *bad* thing. It is interesting in its own way to observe the ways in which romanticism can be made fun of, but the novel tends to drag on and on somewhere near the middle chapter, after the move to Yonville. At the end, its almsot a delight to see Emma die already, and put herself out of her misery."
1,Could not finish it!!!,"We selected this book for our book club and I looked forward to reading a ""classic"". I felt bad quitting the book at around 100 pages. Then I found out one friend quit around 50 pages and another around 30!! Now, I pride myself on always finishing books, no matter how awful, especially ones that are for my book club. This one, no way!!. The other two are also avid readers).My undergraduate minor was English Literature so I have read a variety of classics from a multitude of cultures. Since I had heard that this was a rather ""naughty"" book for it's time, I thought it would be an interesting read. Instead, it's page after page of ongoing descriptions that don't move the story forward. It was just plain boring!! I would have rated it ""no stars"" but the computer would not let me."
3,Emotionally involved,"Although this book is considered a book during the romantic period, it is hardly romantic. It crushes the ideas of romantics and makes them look like a bunch of lazy ass people. Flaubert is telling the world to wake up."
4,Having read twice hating once and almost loving the next,"This novel is one of truth, a truth which is hard to confront. Societies make love to be a beautiful thing which can happen to anyone, but in reality it is a difficult trying thing. Flaubert's use of symbolism lends itself to a re-read or two. The scene at the aggie fair is one that requires a good deal of understanding, and it requires the readers utmost attention. Flaubert uses these scenes to accentuate the depth and reality of the novel. A good read but on the difficult side, excelent for discussion or anylization"
2,Prose style suffers in translation,"Flaubert worked slavishly for years to make this the masterpiece of French prose. If, however, like me, you must read it in English, you are at the mercy of the translator's prose style. Since the story is intentionally tawdry and mundane (to contrast with the supreme elegance of the language), a translation by anybody other than a master of English prose leaves the book pointless. That 's my story and I'm sticking to it. -- Steve Sailer"
2,Why is the Kindle edition more expensive than the book?,"Kindle has really let me down on Madam Bovary. There is a 'free' download whose translation is terrible. Then there is this version in paperback, but the Kindle version appears to be twice as expensive as the book itself.Go figure."
1,Very Disappointing,"My husband and I have in our possession seven cds done by this group.Probably two songs on each cd that are O.K. Music is poorly arranged, voices don't blend well at all and the disguised talking between songs is MOST annoying. Why seven? A dreadful mistake that's all!"
5,Sun Bear Books,"Interesting book; first read it a long time ago, and recently bought it for a friend.Good ""just in case"" advice."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR,This is no a review of the Timer/Printer but the deceptive practices of the vendor. The item was not properly identified by serial number as it prevented me from doing direct comparisans with other vendors. with such knowledge I would not have bought from Online Sports and would have dealt with a more reputable vendor. Who in their right mind charges $41.00 for shipping and handling for something that otherwise would cost $10-$15 to ship if they kney that once the customer was reeled in and would have second thoughts about returning it for a less expensive one. This stopwatch/printer was purchase to help kids with their splits and races. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR!!!
5,gets the job done,"this is an industrial strength tool that doesn't mess around. you can wail on this thing all day long and it never gets tired, if you have the space to get the tool on, its coming apart"
3,description could be more descriptive,"This kit contains the attachments shown but is not the cream/white color in the photo; the pieces that arrived are all black. Also the listing does not give sizes of any of the pieces and the extension wand was mostly what I was after - 11 inches wound up falling a little short of my expectations, literally!"
5,Great find!!!!,"Finding this attachment kit has been my best purchase yet! My old dirt devil was awesome until my husband broke the nozzle. It has sat for years; even after a new hand vac was purchase - I just could not give it up. Finding this kit; best purchase, great find!!"
4,"cheap route to 1-1/4"" hose and brush","I just wanted an inexpensive extension hose and brush for my standard Shop-Vac. This also fits OK with our Sharp standup vacuum.For the price of just a ShopVac brush attachment or 1/2 the price of a hose at Lowe's or Home Despot, you get some extension hose, brush and attachments.I happen to have this hose and brush from an old OLD Dust Devil, so I knew it would work for me. Not a perfect fit, but not bad.I may get another, before they not longer make them."
5,Great vacuum attachments!,"I have a DirtDevil upright, and the extension hoses and wands are not all that long. I couldn't find attachments for that vacuum, but these attachments designed for a hand vac fit it perfectly! Now my upright vacuum has extension hoses, wands, and attachments that let me reach cobwebs on the ceiling, clean the window blinds, and reach into corners without bending over. Great (and inexpensive) purchase to double the uses of my vacuum."
4,Dirt Devil parts,"These attachments work as they should- what else can I say?I lost the old parts years ago and rarely used the machine anymore.Now; I can, original parts are OK quality."
1,not pleased,"I've had fairly good luck with amazon products but this one didn't work out so well. I went to install a car stereo in my brothers' 1994 ford ranger and neither of the products that I ordered from amazon worked for his truck, even though the website said they fit. I triple checked to make sure they were compatible. This kit wasn't even needed. I just slipped the CD player in, it clicked and I was done. I hate wasting money."
1,needs more information,i got one of these little kits at walmart for my dad's 1996 f-150 xlt and there are no parts that fit it it only works for up to 91 f series trucks
4,Great Balls o' Fire,"My 7 month old son loves to play with the balls & he loves hearing the music play everytime he kicks it or reaches in. He's hasn't quite old enough to actually ""make a basket"" without help. The one complaint I have is that when you try to pick up the toy, from the top of basket, it falls apart. There is no way to lock the top & bottom parts together. That causes concern since my son could pick it up & have the bottom fall on him & he gets hurt."
2,Not the best,"We got this toy at Christmas when Ethan was 5 mos., he is now 10 mos. He likes to spin the side spinner but that's about all. I agree that the hoop falls off MUCH too easily and it was really hard to put the bottom pieces together. It seemed silly they weren't already connected. Ethan loves playing with the balls alone but not worth the money."
1,Not worth the money,"I received this toy for Easter for my Twins in thier baskets. I have to say that the nicest part of the toy is the three brightly colored balls. I am a big Fisher Price fan and I like the adjustable volume and the music is not too overbearing but the toy is not made well. The hoop attachement falls off way to easily (everytime) and having to re-assemble it each time its touched is annoying. With three small kids, I need a toy to hold up for play. It's not worth the money and I would not give this to anyone else."
3,Hard to put together and falls apart,"After spending an impossibly long time extricating this thing from the box, I discovered that the base had to be assembled. Unfortunately, the three mini Phillips head screws started getting stripped before I had them screwed in halfway. I don't know if this is just mine or a universal problem. At 6 months, my daughter still isn't very sturdy sitting up by herself and I had hoped that this would give her something to hold on to and support herself somewhat, but the bottom is rounded and falls over very easily. The three balls are NOT soft, they are hollow plastic and do hurt when you get hit with them. They are also too big for a 6 month old's hands. I also had the same problem as other reviewers where the top half comes unconnected from the base, causing the lights to stop working. I would recommend waiting until 8 months maybe before trying this one. Maybe by then it would be easier to play with."
2,Wouldn't reccomend this one,"I heard that at 8 months babies should be putting balls into things so I bought this toy for my 9 month old daughter. First, a screw head broke off. Second, the base isn't connected very well. and third my daughter likes the balls but shows no interest in the toy. I don't feel that it's age appropriate. maybe if I wait a month or so she'll like it."
5,Sexy and comfortable too!,I bought these on sale in red and they are fabulous. They do run a little bit big but with the ankle strap to adjust the fit doesn't seem to be a problem. These shoe have attention written all over them. I bought them for a photo shot; the photographer and everyone that has seen the pictures just raves about how sexy they are! Even with such a high heel they are surprisingly comfortable.
2,Does not have lemony flavor,"While the quality of the tea leaves are beyond reproach, I bought this particular item because it promises the natural lemon flavor that I would have loved. But, sadly, this tea did not live up to its promises."
5,great boots!,"I wanted a sheepskin boots with hard sole and I found this minnetonka one and its a great boots! I thought it might be tight with all the fur inside so I usually wear a size 6 but I chose size 7. I think its better to choose your regular size, because it was big for me. be careful of the color of your socks you wear! mine's turned black a little. My feet gets really cold in the winter but this boots keeps me warm!"
5,Better than any other!,I love my Minnetonka moccasins!!! I've had mine for 5 years and am about to purchase a new pair. I wear them almost every day during the cooler months!
4,Wonderul Boots!,"These boots are great. Not a bad thing to say about them. They are comfortable, fit beautifully and the sheepskin lining color is mixed with a light brown color that is unique and georgous."
2,Dissapointed,"I just got the package today. I bought this product cause i thought they're quite cheap and might be worth buying. The boots I recevied are quite different from the picture. Although it came with the minnetonka box and everything, i think the boots are fake. Also, when i look at the minnetonka real website, the boots are way nicer than the ones i got. So, i'm kind of dissapointed."
5,The Spice of Life!,"A brilliant compilation taking hold of the best sounds in underground music today with a truely sophisticated resurrection of the deep house beat. One could almost say that the soul of this release belongs to the masters of art form; Earth Wind and Fire, cica 1978. Every track is right on the mark of good style. Having come from San Francisco myself its nice to know the talent is still alive and well. Good Job Miguel!"
5,MJLLUCKA,"This is probably the best cd in the deep house/lounge genre(summer in paris might give it a run). The music flows with every song, no slowdowns or odd ball beats not matching the other songs. I'm a DJ and when I do wine tastings or late night parties, I throw this cd on and just about everyone will ask ""who is this, and whats the name of the CD, I love it""."
4,made in Germany...but ok!,"Micatone strange name for a group, but the music of this CD is something that don't need a name : is beautiful and relaxing.If you like turn off the light, drink a glass (maybe more) of red wine and ... This is your CD. A lot of influence (jazz, ambient,electronic) but with a style, probabily a Micatone style.Something good from the Europe."
3,Just a tad bit of a disapiontment.,"The book was just ok.. I wish I had seen it in a book store first... I might not have purchased it.I enjoy the frame games in the week-end news paper inserts and was a little dispointed.I didn't like the odd shape of the book or the way it was set up, with the puzzles and answers. I found the puzzles weren't of the same caliber as those I enjoy weekly."

5,Great book!,Well we all know Anna Franklin is a talented writer - but this is one of her books that I have that has made its way to my list of favorites. So many books on Fairies are full of fluffy stuff - with charms and spells using glitter and conjuring up images of giggling sprites. This book gives an in-dept description of what fairy magick is all about. If you are just starting out - this is a wonderful book to give you a solid base on the history of Fairies - the role they play in mythology and how you can incorporate them into your spellwork. No fluff - just good info. She also has a fairy oracle deck now that is excellent - a great companion to this book - Amazon sells both - so stock up!
3,ok but not very practical,"I've found that while this book has a lot of information, not much of it is practical enough to be put into practice. It's almost like reading a fiction novel. I am looking for real world experiences & advice. just very disappointed with this book. A book called working with fairies should have more information on actually working with them. Instead of more than half the book being on lore."
3,good book. but it's just stories,"anna presents fairies as if they actually exist, people should know better than to actually belive in this stuff.its like she is claiming it as a fact. this isnt the 12 century."
5,fits well,as soon as I unwrapped this item I installed them on my machine and the fit was precise and quality and workmanship as well as materials used are very good.
4,vacuum belt,"Got the belt within a week, installed and ran the vac... what more can I say, no fancy wrapper, just the belts in a manila envelope. no garbage!"
1,Good Belts -- VERY poor customer service,"It took FOREVER to get this vendor to realize that they had never told me how they were shipping and when I provided them with a PO BOX, they could not ship as they shipped UPS. When I received a call from them, they told me the belts kept coming back as undeliverable to a PO BOX. I gave them a street address and the belts were delivered OK. I fault them for not replying to MANY emails about the shipping. They just don't get it - everyone knows UPS will not ship to a PO BOX - they never told me how they were shipping and never posted on their website how they shipped. For such a small item, I thought USPS would do. Apparently not."
5,Dirt Devil Belts,Fit and perform as advertised Fast delivery. What can I say..I'm a happy camper with a hand vacuum that now works with these belts
4,"A little flimsy, but great space saver",Got 2. Had to supper glue one that the front clear plastic part broke off.Have 3 now and love the space-saving.
1,Useless,Doesn't suck anything in.Hard to change bags.Hair keeps tangled on the roller.Worst purchase I have ever done.
5,Nice little vacuum,We've used one of these for a couple of years and have been very pleased with it. Because it has it's own beater/brush it works great at removing pet hair from our furniture. It picks up hair that the suction hose from our floor vac just can't get. I also like the fact that it has a reusable bag.A very handy household appliance!
1,Vacuum That Doesn't,"Got stairs and pets and kids?? Better shop around.I wanted a powerful, portable vacuum to clean pet hair and dirt off the 2 flights of stairs in my home. Well, if that is what you are looking for....keep looking!There is close to no suction power through the beater brush and even less through the crevice tool. And if that wasn't bad enough you are almost guaranteed to be deaf by the end of the first three stairs!The only recommendation here is keep a receipt for a refund if you decide to buy anyway!!"
1,"Cute, but basically useless.",This would be nice to have if it had enough suction to pick up even light dirt. Unfortunately the suction is not even close to being sufficient. Even with the beater brush it is unable to clean anything but extremely light materials. I do not recommend buying one of these vacuums.
4,Not for ALBUMS. It is only for DVD/CDs,The case is great and it has a good look. Seems durable but it does not hold manuals/handbooks for videogames. Its pockets are only for CD/DVDs.
3,Nice lights but 2 of 12 DOA,"Two of these lights never lit up even after a full day of charging in direct sunlight. Replaced the batteries with fresh ones but still no light. I must say that this product is great looking and produces a beautiful bluish light. They do seem to require an ample sun exposure to give more than a few hours of light, so watch it if you plan to use them in shady areas. I would have given 5 stars if all the units had worked, but since that wasn't the case, I deducted 1 star for each defective light."
5,Yard Lighting,"These were excellent lights, fit and finish was very good. Three of 12 were slow to charge initially but seem to be fine now. 5 of them were damaged the next day after installation by 2"" hail....bent but still shining as we speak. That tells me the circuitry is very durable. Hail hit hard enough to knock the batteries loose and they are still working.Easy to assemble and install. Highly recommended and I will be being a replacement set due to the cosmetic hail damage to the brims."
2,"Looks Nice but breaks easy, weak solar cell",These look great. The problem is the plastic spike that holds it in the ground. The plastic is very fragile. They cannot handle the cold climate in MA. 4 out of 12 have broken in 3 months. When they are cold if you touch the light the plastic snaps. Some of them break all by themselves. Maybe just from the change in temperature. The plastic is too thin where the spike attaches to the collar that goes into the copper tube.I replaced a couple of old solar lights from a local hardware chain. The Strathmore light up for only 1/3 the amount of time as my old ones. Maybe if you have all day strong sun they may work for you. I was disappointed with their perfomance.
1,no light output,"While the fixtures look great and are nice and heavy (mostly metal), the light output is much less than the el-cheapo ones I used to have. Plus about 20% of them don't work at all. I will try buying new batteries for them - which is a hassle and more cost, to see if that helps matters. I would certainly not recommend anyone purchase them."
3,Copper solar light set,lamps are very nice. They light up beautifully. They do not work very well unless exposed to direct sunlight all day. Burning time not as long as described. Mildly disappointed with them but would probably be ok in a high sunlight location.
4,Solar Lights,Good construction and value for 12 lights. Batteries are poor so they need to be replaced. Lights under partial shade don't last long into the evening. 10 hours is a stretch ... 4-5 hours after a full day of sun is more like it.
5,Great buy,"These lights were better than I expected built tough and super bright, I'd recommend these lights to anyone with a tight budget."
1,Not happy.,"When I first started using these lights I was very happy. They are very nice looking, easy to assemble, and the lights that were in direct sunlight all day stayed lit for about 8 hours a night.Now, after using these lights for a little longer than a month, the lights in direct sunlight stay on barely 3 hours a night. I think all the positive reviews for this product must be from people that have been using their lights for a short time.Don't buy these lights, they aren't worth it at any price."
2,needs plenty of sun,"two of the lights did not work at all. You need to make sure the lights are positioned in direct sunlight. If you live in Oregon , forget it."
4,OK,"Have had these for about 3 months, when I got them 1 of them did not work at all, and know I have 2 more that are not working, so really you get 9 for that price, which is still a bargin."
1,very disappointing,"I bougth this product based in all the reviews I saw here before.The structure is very nice and elegant. However the solar system itself is very weak. In cloudly days they keep on for no more than 1 to 2 hours (maximum) and in sunny days it's very difficult to see any of them on after 4-5 hours.Besides this, the light itself isn't very strong. The first day I put them at the garden (by the way the only day they worked for several hours) my wife said: ""do we have now a landing strip at the garden""?Keep away!!"
4,Very bright. But 1 out of 12 had issue with batteries,These are the brightest LED landscape lights that I've seen. So far (3 weeks of use) watering hasn't effected them. They seem to hold a charge real well except for the one I mentioned. I put some sony re-chargeable batteries into that one and it works fine now. I would say this was a 4 and a half star purchase. Recommended.
4,Good Value!,"Can't beat the price, the look great and work great. One of the lights i received didn't work. It wasn't the battery either the solar sensor was busted so it came from the factory fully lit and wouldn't 'turn off' even in sunlight, so it doesn't work, but the other 11 work perfectly. I didn't try to replace the broken unit. Really the price for one less than a set is still worth it. The LED is a bit 'colder' than a traditional incandescent, it's not as warm looking but it lasts longer. Just be careful how you place them so they don't look like runway lights. *sly grin*"
2,not what I'd hoped for,"The first few days these lights came on bright at sundown and were still shining at sunrise the next day. That was in August. Now it's November and 4 of the lights never come on at all. Four of them come on for a couple of hours and the rest are dark before midnight. They still look nice in the landscape during the day, but at night they'd just as well not be there."
1,These stink,Dont waste your money on these. I got mine all intact no problems. I put them in the ground and everyday is a different story. Sometimes 3 are on sometimes 5 then sometimes just 1. I mean come on are they possessed or something. These lights are horrible I do not recommend them at all the cheaper ones I have work alot better.
1,"Not Ready for ""Prime Time""","I should have followed my wife's advice--""solar just doesn't work"".These lights look nice out of the box but skin deep beauty isn't followed by function. At best they ""glow"" for about 3 hours after dusk. On cloudy days they struggle to ""glow"" an hour. In addition, those that are not placed directly in the sun e.g. under a branch or behind a tree trunk, don't ""glow"" hardly at all--no matter whether the day was sunny or not.The price was right but the product wasn't...if you want shiny copper lamps for decoration, buy these. If you want a light that actually ""lights up"" for more than an hour or so--stay with a ""non-solar"" variety."
5,Great lights at a great price,I like the idea of solar light but I saw many of them are too dim. I took the chance when Amazon was having a sale. I could not be more happier. They are as bright as my 10 watt malibu lights in my backyard. I coundn't wait until the next time when these lights are on sale.
3,Where was his editor?,"I would like to give a glowing review to this book - but I can't. It has a number of important things to say about the history of the 20th century, contemporary and not so contemporary American and British intellectuals, government (especially the EU), and it could have been a very worthwhile book. But between the sesquipedalian vocabulary and the syntactical thickets, reading some of Conquest's chapters is, to borrow a simile, ""like kicking a dead whale down the beach""."
1,disappointing,"Robert has written some great books, but this is not one of them.. Disjointed and vaguely written... Save your money.."
2,Reflon skiblights face illuminator loose powder,The product is probably good. I just couldn't get the right shade. Didn't seem to match up with that same shade I purchased at another time.
4,"Great, if you see past the initial effort...","My ts360 is great; there are lots of features in the menus to customize your use and appearance of the guide. I use mine solely as an OTA receiver, and bought it second-hand. There were a few issues...The first was, since it was stored away for a while by original owner, it would not power up right away. There was a constant clicking noise; no display. After letting it click away for a few hours, it came back to life. Then a ""boot fail"" error on the display. You can still bypass this by pressing 'select' to get to the menu to choose ""no dish"". The receiver resets itself, then works like a charm. I was so happy to get all my local digital/hd channels. BTW, both problems were solved by a little 'googling.'The ts360 is easy to use, and the guide still provides you with almost all the info (times, descriptions, etc.) on programs found on the digital subchannels (18.1, 24.1, etc.). I've had no problems with it ever since I revived it."
2,Pretty Junky. Skip it.,"My particular unit was very unreliable. Would just restart periodically going through the whole ""BOOTING"" process, which takes 3 to 5 minutes. Finally it just stopped working altogether with a ""BOOT FAIL"" message. While it did work, I thought that the user interface was pretty lackluster on par with a cable box from 5 years ago. They should have put more time in making it work better than include ridiculous 'circa 1980' video games buried down in the menus (like the one where the snake grows with every dot it goes over). Lame. Find a different one than this underperformer."
2,HD Receiver,I wish I knew more about this product. It is old and very used. It seems to be working. I am yet to use this product.
3,"Perfect, but don't let kids use without supervision","This excercise machine is a good rendition of the old spring centered design for the same purpose of toning abs. I've used it with great success and happy, toned-abs but I miss the older model for a greater level of resistance. I figure someone redid the design after a few kids got their fingers pinched in the spring center.This model however still has a problem in the foam-overlay on foot supports. If you're not careful kids will use the foam-overlay AS the foot supports and rip them from the supports for a now ripped ab excerciser.. workable, but more bothersome.Bring Back the older Model!"
5,Great Father's Day gift,"I got this blender for my husband for Father's Day. He really likes its power for making Frappucinos. I like that it is so easy to clean, with no buttons to clean around and no rubber gasket to lose. Another nice thing: I ordered this with Amazon's gift wrapping option. This was the first thing I had ever ordered that way, and I was impressed. The blender came like this: Inside a larger plain shipping box was the boxed blender inside a blue velvet drawstring bag with gold ribbon ties and bows. The bows were a little crushed from riding in the UPS truck, but with a little fluffing, they looked very nice. What a nice way to get a package delivered so there is no sneaking or peaking allowed!"
2,Not sure it was worth the money,"I received this blender as a gift six years ago. Today, while making a smoothy, I discovered that all the rubber teeth that turn the blades have stripped. I noticed some ripping earlier, but now they are completely shredded. It has lasted for six years, amazingly. Reading on Epinions, this blender is LOADED with problems. This teeth-stripping flaw has happened to people in less than three years under regular use. We paid nearly $100 for this blender. I'd expect this poor quality and life expectancy in a cheapo blender. I maybe use my three times a month. So very sad. So few quality appliances anymore.Pros: lovely color, nice big pitcher, 5 speeds (all crushing ice)Cons: expensive for what you get, very messy, and very unreliable under heavy use. BTW, the ice never crushes very smoothly."
3,NOT a smoothie machine,"If you're looking for a blender to make your average blender-type stuff, this is the one. However, if you're looking for a frozen smoothie, look for a Blendtec. I've tried various ways of blending, either starting low and moving to high, and just starting on high. What this blender will do is toss the smoothie material up about an inch in the jar, creating an air pocket for the blade to spin freely. Then you have to shut it down, remove the jar, open the air pocket, and go back to doing what you're doing. Then, 3-5 seconds into the next cycle, it does it ALL OVER AGAIN! Blending sauces and crushing ice won't pose much of a challenge to this. However, if you even think of a smoothie, you're going to be seriously irritated with the performance (or lack thereof). I'm moving up to a Blendtec."
2,Very Disappointing,"What a disappointment! After 1 month this blender leaks from the bottom, and efforts to tighten the base have been useless."
3,Ok,"It's a good blender actually but has some design flaws... the blades and bearings are cast into the bottom plastic so remain in the bottom of the blender so cleaning the last bit out of the container is almost impossible. and clean up can only be done effectively in a dish machine, not by hand for the same reason."
3,Ok blender but wouldn't repurchase,"Had this blender for 4 years and it did reasonably well at making smoothies, etc.However, the jar started leaking and rather than replace I purchased the Blendtec blender.The Blendtec really blows the KithenAid away at smoothies and just about everything else."
1,2 self-destructed in less than 5 months,"The gears came completely apart, and the motor started smoking after 6 weeks. Replaced it, and 4 months later the same thing happened. No replacement again of this piece of junk!"
3,"works well so far, cleans easliy, concerned about product life tho..","I purchased this item a short time ago and wanted to try it out some before commenting. It has done a nice job so far, I've only make smoothies and soup. It cleans easily which is a plus. The only issue I have is that it smells hot when I use it on puree or liquify..I'm concerned about the life of this product due to this. Hope it's just because it's new."
1,Shouldn't it last more than 36 hours???,Carafe leaked during second use. Terrible. What else is there to say? Seems like a common problem after reading other reviews.
3,Lasts but holes allow leakage,"This blender has lasted for several years. The only complaint is the holes in the bottom of the pitcher allow fluid to leak out over the blender, making an extra step in clean up."
3,Broke after a few uses,"This blender had great reviews, so I bought it because we were looking for something that was powerful and dependable. We got the blender and used it immediately. After a few uses, the blades at the bottom broke! Good thing Amazon customer service was good enough to send us a new one.We have since not had any problems with the blender, but it does produce a burning smell if it blends for more than around 30 seconds.I do like the style of the blender though. The color looks retro and the plastic jar is awesome. I am not nervous about the jar breaking."
2,"Enjoyable book, but.....","Nice pictures, and enjoyable to read. But as an actual reference for restoration it is pretty lacking. It varies from being either too general, or in some instances specific to a particular model that you don't own. It either assumes you are a competent backyard mechanic, or that you are new to turning wrenches. The author has apparently never restored a tractor himself, but he has interviewed at least two hobby restorers, and apparently has watched them do a few.I would rate the book higher (at least 3 stars) if it wasn't titled as an ""ultimate restoration"" reference. It isn't."
2,Not much going on here,"Not much going on hereReviewer: Doug Kent from Sunnyvale, Ca USAThe subject of time, its psychological manifestation and the spiritual, mystical and occult insights has been a life long interest for me. This is not the first time I have been sadly disappointed by a book on time...If you have a real interest in time try ""Time,Space and Knowledge"" by Tartang Tulku this book goes directly into your experience of time, how to experience and manipulate it."
4,A Pure ADRENALINE RUSH from Beginning to End!,"I had not read a collection of horror stories in a long time. In fact, I don't care to even watch horror movies the way I used to - just too much real-life misery in the world. However, prompted by curiosity regarding the talents of a fellow writer, I started reading Mr. Reed's novel and ended up being reminded of how much enjoyment there is in reading a tale that offers a near perfect escape from the mundane concerns of everyday life. The stories that resonate strongly involve a woman who searches for love in the VERY WRONG place and a tale of love and obsession involving a twisted group of Vampires. I think Mr. Reed displays a brilliant talent for conveying the intensity of love - and offers a very fresh perspective on the emotional complexities involved. A few of the stories took a few pages to really get rolling - but overall, Mr. Reed does an excellent job at presenting the true diversity to be found in even the most horrific of relationships."
4,A Bizzarre Collection/Compulsively Readable,"If you're looking for something a little out of the ordinary, this collection of ""horror"" stories is for you. Although you'll find some of the usual suspects here (particularly vampires), Reed's horror is more of the stuff real-life nightmares are made of: a closeted gay man with an unusual empathy for Jeffrey Dahmer upon his arrest; a unique interpretation behind the motive for Lizzie Borden's infamous crimes; a rape victim finds help and vengeance from beyond the grave; a demented cook with a real taste for young men... There's a lot here, some of it nightmare-inducing, some of it laugh out loud funny (a 300-lb. vampire finds love in all the wrong places), but it's always a can't-put-down type of read...and one that leaves you thinking."
5,A PERFECT EDITION TO ANY HORROR ANTHOLOGY COLLECTION,"I've been a steady Rick Reed fan for several years now. I bought this short story anthology a few months ago right after publication, but saved it for October when I like to revisit my horror collection and spend a few nights with a blood-chilling book that might keep me awake a while longer. Hey, Christmas has its traditions of ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life."" I have mine during Halloween which include most of Stephen King's short story anthologies and a few movies like ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""Sleepy Hollow."" Let's just say I will definitely be pulling ""Twisted"" off the shelf year after year to enjoy. It's a twisted creepy span of Reed's work doing what he does best...scaring you to death!"
4,First step before de PMP test,"This book is like a spoken introductory course to get prepare for the PMP test. The positive side is that the book is organized in the phases of a project. It covers samples while explaining the content. The book can not be used alone for the PMP exam, but it is enough to start running project the right way. If you are not involved at all in project management, you might need to understand some term before reading the book. I will encourage you to read the book at least two times to memorize the most important issues in PM."
4,not the best but good,"If you like jbt this is a nice cd, though not their best for my understanding."
4,Air Purifier Review,"This product arrived at my door on time and in the exact condition the seller specified. It is working as described, is quiet and does not take up much room. The only thing I wish it had was the instruction booklet, but that was not necessary in learning how to operate the unit, as it is pretty self explanatory.I am happy with it."
3,not plasmacluster,this is very silent air cleaner and goob product per se. However this has no plasmacluster function. product descripton is apparently wrong.
3,Seller lies! Not a plama cutter or an ion generator,I don't know how good this product is because I never opened it. The amazon.com seller lied about it being a plasma cutter (it isn't) and then admitted it when asked. I was issued a refund minus a re-stocking fee and my own return shipping WHAT A FRAUD! I ended up having to take this to MasterCard to resolve. Boo for Amazon not making the seller update the description AFTER the dispute was resolved.
5,One of the top handful,"If I were possessed by a all-consuming passion to understand the Battle of the Little Bighorn and were limited to owning the number of books I could count on one hand, Michno's Lakota Noon would be one of those books. The author at times stretches his conjectures too far and he fails to compare the Lakota accounts with those of Custer's surviving Indian scouts. But Michno makes sense of what at first seem a confused mass of vague native accounts and demonstrates that they are accurate and valuable testimonies. For my money, this is the best Indian perspective book available on the great Lakota and Cheyenne victory."
4,Lacota Noon,"This book is excellent for those who are interested in a detailed history of the battle at Little Big Horn - ""Custer's Last Stand"" from the indian's point of view. The author painstakingly breaks the battle into 10 minute intervals from start to finish based on interviews with the various tribe members. His goal is not to ""De-Bunk"" all that we have read and studied about the battle but to give a well balanced narrative based on those who did survive it. It is well worth the time and effort of the reader."
5,The Best Ever!,I am a 20 yr professional chef and I have to say these are without a doubt the finest collection of pots and pans I have used! I bought this set for my daughter for Christmas and now I want a set. I can't find them anywhere!! :( The new version made by KitchenAid does not have the same handles!!
5,Native Brotherhood by Ruben Romero,"I first heard about this CD from one of my massage therapy magazines. Being a massage therapist, yoga instructor and an avid music lover, I am always looking for new music to add to my collection. It is a combination of soft flutes, sultry latin style rhythms, and at times, even an upbeat type of tempo. It is appropriate for yoga classes as well as massage therapy sessions, or simply for some easy type of listening."
4,Maybe it doesn't deserve the credit,"I started putting drops of this in my Diet Coke and lemonade a few weeks before taking yet another cholesterol test to see if I should go on medication. I didn't change my diet at all, thinking that it was inevitable that my cholesterol would be high since it's a family trait. While I can't say that the results were dramatic, my doctor did back down from putting me on medication because my cholesterol level had dropped and suggested a better diet and more exercise.Not scientific, I know, so I've given the a tentative 4 stars.FYI, I'm not sure it's in the product description, but this stuff is sweet, so you can't just put it in unsweetened green tea without noticing its presence."
1,Lacks a clear theoretical foundation,"Despite Bobbitt's excellent credentials, this book is a huge let-down. For a book supposedly covering vast swathes of history and offering keys to the future, the author's ontological and epistemological stance are never made clear. Like much political science that has pretensions to erudition, this is classic data-mining expedition into history to ""prove"" a pre-determined (and essentially untestable) narrative of the past."
3,verbose,"As a doctoral student in International Relations, with a Masters degree in Information Systems, I would like to make the following point to all my superiors: keep it simple. This book of 800 pages could have been written in 200 pages. The ideas are interesting but, because the book lacks structure, finding them is like bobbing for apples. The book, in fact, reads like some vast government report (reminding me of those old five-hour, Soviet-style speeches). Too bad, because there are some very sweet apples down below the water-line. An excellent first draft; please edit and republish."
3,Complementary readings to Bobbitt's book,"There are already some good reviews so I will only suggest reading the following books instead of, or in addition to, Bobbitt's peculiar work: a) ""War in human civilization"" by Azar Gat; b) ""War before Civilization. The Myth of the Peaceful Savage"", by Lawrence Keeley; c) ""How War Began"" by Keith F. Otterbein; d) ""War and Peace and War: The Rise and Fall of Empires"" by Peter Turchin; and e) ""War and the Law of Nations: A General History"" by Stephen Neff."
3,Not much about everything,"Just looking at the impressive table-of-content and its breadth makes you wonder about the size of this book. Unfortunately, the authors decided to briefly cover a large number of topics without going in-depth on any one of them. So, if you're looking for a technology/solutions overview, this is the right book for you. If you're interested in one of the hot new Cisco technologies and want to get the details from this book, you'll probably be disappointed."
1,What can I do when dealing with an irresponsible vendor??,"I bought two memory kits, one of which is DOA and never worked. I immediately sent an email to the vendor about it (and even offered to send back the bad unit to him), who promised to send me a replacement kit a week later. But since then, nothing happened, I did not receive anything from the vendor. I have sent the vendor many emails, all without receiving any response.I do not know what I should do at this point!"
5,great memory,I already had 4GB installed on my computer and ordered this to make it 8GB. This memory is very stable and I love the heat sync to help the memory run cooler. I have not had a problem of overheating with this memory. I'm running an Intel Quad core Q6600 processor 2.4 GHz FSB 1066MHz 8M Cache with dual ASUS 9600GT 512M video cards connected SLI on a ASUS P5N32-E SLI Motherboard in a Antec 900 air cooled case.
5,Excellent RAM,"Works very well. I replace my old 2 Gb module with these (along a 64-bit OS) and my computer runs like a charm, very stable.However, I was planning to use these modules together with my not-so-old 2 Gb modeule (by Corsair aswell) but I got a lot of unstability problems, but it was propabably the motherboards's fault.Anyways, this RAM is excellent."
3,Price has gone up at least 2 times.,"I bought this ram a couple years ago when it was less than $50 back in the day at compusa. Its still good, hasnt died on me yet and has been keeping my real fast. Its still good ram ive had it for about 2 years and planning on building a new micro atx with 2 5870 cards and im gona need some new ddr3 and its going to be so freaken expensive. The reason why im giving it 3 stars is how bad the price is."
2,Goodbye Corsair,I have 8 GB of this 4-4-4-12 ram. (4 x 1GB) and (2 x 2GB) that doesn't run well (if at all) at the advertised speed on my EVGA 680i motherboard. I read online that Corsair uses cheaper chips now. All I can say is my history with them stops here. On the up side the heatsinks are good installation handles.
3,Too easy,"I was fully finished with this in 40 minutes! Skip this model and go onto something that might be at least a LITTLE challenge. Even for beginners this type of model puts together almost by itself. Including the tiny bit of painting I did (just to add a modicum of authenticity) it was over in under an hour. Amazon, please make it clearer if models are to be ""snap-together"" type."
1,disappointed for Christmas,"The description does not say that this product is plastic. The Chrome tires rims are plastic the rubber for the wheels is rubber. I bought this for my father as he likes Antique vehicles but I can't give this as a Christmas gift, I can probably give it to my 4 year old because it looks cheap."
5,"Yes, very simple installation","The other review didn't really say what the problem was. The only thing that took more than 3 minutes for me was that I installed this on a brand new door and frame... since the mortise on the door flange and the latch were both rounded at the corners, I had to tap out the corners to be square with a chisel... took an extra two minutes. Two screws held the flange in place and two screws went through the door to hold the two halves together. The handles are great because I installed these for my mom and they allow her to go through the doors carrying laundry baskets or whatever and just open the door with an elbow or a finger. Couldn't ask for better, especially at this low price.All I can imagine for the other reviewer's problem would be that they thought they could install it on a blank door that wasn't mortised."
1,NOT A SIMPLE INSTALLATION!,"This might be a fine handle and lock, but do not believe the description that it is a ""simple installation, requiring only a screwdriver."""
4,one Knight In Venice,"This was the first book i have read by Tori Philips, and after reading this i would glady read others.Jessica and Francis are the main characters. I had to keep turning the pages to see what would happen next . This book gives u a glimpse into life in Venice in 1550 and the peoples beleifes, even though poor Jessica had to suffer for what others beleaved. I dont want to give up to much but Jessica was born with a birthmark on her face and she must keep her face covered. Thats all im gonna give away i will let u read for yourself."
2,One Knight In Venice,"Having read all the previous books in the Cavendish Chronicles, I have to say that this was my least favorite. There was not as much character developement as there were historical references, and very minimal appearance or reference of or about the family. I am also more fond of the setting of England rather than Venice.I still eagerly await Ms. Phillips' next book."
3,Obsessions Is Easily Forgotten........,"I like the size of this book filled with black and white photographs. One does not need 11 by 14 inch presentation books to present artistic photography. The title should have been bondage since the photographs are 90% this and not much more. So unless the world of bondage is your artistic pleasure, then look elsewhere for the fine artistic nudes. There are a few memorable photographs but the rest are forgotten quickly and thus obsession is the furthest thing from this reader's mind. Sure there have been worst collections but there are many more fantastic books on this subject which makes this one a nice view to expand one's knowledge of this black and white world which no one should ever be obsessed about."
3,Don't buy this book,In the GED test you only need to know maths and English. The rest is simply reading and understanding what you read. Save your money and only buy the complete version of this book for maths and English in one book.
3,"ok, but could have been better","You can learn alot from reading this book, about such things as The building of America, the law, and citizenship from a black perspective, but I wanted to learn more about the few inputs from the men that were interviwed for this book. Most of the book was written from the author's viewpoint instead of a lot of different men that I throught I was gonna be getting when I first brought this book."
4,This is a really gets to the heart of race relations.,This gets to the heart of it. This really seems to be a book from the heart. Learned a lot from it.
5,"D.Robitaille Warwick RI "" Oscar performances""","I caught this movie about 5 minutes into the beginning and I had to sit and see the entire movie. I, like many others have seen the Psycho's, the Silence of the lambs, and movies of this type of genre, but I found that this movie about the famous psychic was the most intriguing and best who done movie I have ever seen. The writers keep you running in many directions looking for killers and reasonings, and the actors, Danson, Steenbergen, Palance and other play their roles to what I would consider Oscar nominations. It makes me wonder why movies like this never get the acclaim they deserve and others because they go to Cannes get the Oscars when work like this is shelved, kind of like Gran Torino was in 2009. Best whodunit movie ever."
4,Huge James Van Praagh fan,I really liked this movie. At times it seemed to drag but overall I really enjoyed it.The cast was great and for what paid for the DVD you couldnt beat it.
5,Entering the Paranormal,"This movie was extremely LONG but worth the time spent watching it. The story was eerie but entertaining. I have always enjoyed ESP, the paranormal and the psychic worlds and as a result this movie was right up my alley. Ted Danson, Mary Steenburgen and Queen Latifa were wonderful. And the ending was a total surprise.I have watched this movie twice already and will probably watch it again."
3,Movie is Great but DVD Needs to be Redone,"I saw this on TV and loved it. I'm very hard of hearing and it was wonderful to have the closed captioning to go with it.When I bought the DVD, it didn't occur to me to check for closed captioning or English subtitles. I thought everyone put those on their DVDs now a days.To find one of my favorite movies is unwatchable and behind the times technically, really disappoints me. I feel I have lost money on the DVD."
1,Replacement sponge,The center of this sponge fell apart on it's first use. It appeared that it was old and the center material had dried out. I threw the whole unit in the trash.
5,Solid Sounds from Deep America,"Laid back ,folk/blues,just funky enough to entertain form begining to the end.Grayson Capps gets it right"
5,incredibly funny!!,"now THIS is a funny activitybook for kids! it looks unusual for a gaming book, and unusual it is! These games are so wacky, I laughed my socks of! My sons are playing 'Furniture Fuddle' all day, and they have great fun with it. Very innovative games. Even a game with a slice of cheese and a straw! You wonder how they came up with all this stuff. This gamebook beats all others. To be honest, I had a lot of fun with it myself, just reading it. The drawings look a bit strange, but well, let's say that fits with the book! don't hesitate to buy this one."
3,Can I have a resolution please?,"I tip my hat to Ms.Gibb for her convincing portrayal of Thelma, a girl abused into insanity. But after a classic build up, there is a common let down. The story ends with no real resolution. That alone took away 2 stars from an otherwise masterful literary piece."
5,mouthing the words,I thought the story was very impactful and meaningful! Her sense of emotion came across in each sentence / each word!
2,"Didn't inspire empathy, just a sad slog....","The main character in this story is sad and empty. And I found her story sad and empty.When reading a book I have to ask myself, ""Do I want to be where this has taken me?"" or ""Do I want to know more about this person, enough to keep reading?""The answer is no, no to this story. I don't care if she overcomes her misery, because, and I know this is monstrous, I don't like her. I can't feel her.One stylistically impressive thing; I'd never seen such apathy and humor fused into a story of abuse and neglect and growing madness. That I can appreciate, it was a mind-bending approach. Uncomfortable, but completely unique."
1,Huge diappointment,"A sad slog is right. Not however, for the sketchy plot. Sad because the prose is mundane. Sad because I couldn't care less about this character. Sad because she doesn't exist in any reality I could ever imagine. What a bore. Who wrote these reviews? Rarely do I see my own opinion differing so drastically from both professional and amateur accessments. The writing is infantile. The ""humor"" obvious, cliche, embarrassing and, well, just not humorous. No insights, no character development. Don't waste your time."
5,One of the best books of 2000,I couldn't put this book down. It depicted the feelings of a child in an unjust world in such a powerful and empathic way. Camilla Gibb has the ability to 'catch us up' in this child's life with her evocative and creative language. We really connect to this child. I highly recommend it.
2,Aladdin Sane-30th anniversary,"I've been a bowie fan right from the early stuff through to Lets Dance after that he lost it. This release had great potential but is a real let down. First the packaging - nice idea but the execution is not well done, it is difficult to turn pages, the inside cd holders are totally useless- eventually they will tear, (if you can get them out) the track listing on the inside sleeves don't relate to the cd (colour) track listing. As for the extra tracks, nothing of interest except the sax version of 'John..' as for the live versions, who cares. Why did'nt they make the second disc interesting like the T.Rex alternative album versions, this showed the tracks from Bolans early solo workings to full band workings. Check out The Slider and the 30th anniversary of Electric Warrior. I'm giving this 2 stars as the remastered sound is excellent. Did they mention that Mick Ronson played Bolans guitar part on the prettiest star note for note? that might have been of interest."
5,Ahh.. Got to Love Bowie,"I am Truely Insulted on what One man Said..."" To 1980..Then He is lost it"" First off that is NOT true at all. New Bowie Fans Out there... Don't listen to That Bull. This Cd... The music is Just Fantstic. Ziggy fans this is a Must Have Cd. It has a Great Extra Disk.. and it is Re-enhanced very well. I enjoyed it. Any Bowie Fan would as Well."
4,Great Discs Horrible Packaging,"This anniversary edition of one of Bowie's greatest albums contains an amazing bonus disc and a great booklet. However, I have a HUGE gripe and that is the packaging. The discs are jammed in to sleeves in the front and back of the package. They are stuffed in so tight that I had to use scissors to get them out. When I did, they were scuffed already from when the manufacturers shoved them in. Why put such effort into producing such a beautiful package and insert the CDs in such a careless way. I've found this sort of packaging before and it's really annoying. I personally like my CDs unscratched. Other than that the sound is awesome and the bonus tracks are fantastic."
3,Cheaper at Whole Foods,"This is really great tuna. But in Washington DC I pay $1.50 per can at Whole Foods. Here on Amazon it is $20.23 or 12 or $1.69 per can (on Feb 23, 2008). If I'm buying in bulk, shouldn't I be saving money?"
3,"Ok, but...",Same quality as the other products in the line...Not a favorite of mine though...I'll stick to the tomato based ones...MJL
5,"Like sand, but better","I have a California king snake, and I think he really likes this substrate. It feels kind of like sand, which is good because in the wild he would be living on sandy soil. But it is better than using actual sand, because it is more absorbent. I will definitely buy this product in the future, although it is relatively expensive, so unfortunately I can't line the cage with enough for him to dig through."
2,"Good price, left food bad perfomance","After a couple year using it, I can say the left pedal never works fine. The sensitive is so bad and it has a weird piece in the base of the pedal, that always crash when you hit it.I strongly recommend save more money and go for something else, perl Eliminator double pedal, tama speed or axis.Besides that, the right pedal is good enought"
1,Boooooring,"When I flipped thru it at the book store it looked interesting. When I started to read it at home my eyes glazed over. The subject is very interesting, too bad the book is so boring."
5,"Valuable method, that works","I have now been using PSP for over a year now, and as it says on the tin, it has improved how I develop software. My estimates are better, my code has fewer bugs and the others take less time to remove. I recommend following his instructions and don't worry about the theories. His instructions work and deserve 6 stars.A word or warning, TSP is not an optional extra for most people. PSP is hard to learn and most people give up without the support of a team."
4,The Sea,"Caught by the Sea is a very interesting book. This book is a true story based on Gary Paulsen's experiences of the sea. I found so many things out about the sea, like how to tell when there is going to be a big storm or how to set a sail. I learned about parts of a boat and what each part dose. The book was exciting when Gary Paulsen struggled to live in the most dangerous kinds of weather conditions. Overall this book was very intriguing. I think people who want to learn more about the sea should read this book."
4,Caught by the awesomeness,I decided to right this because it spoke to me. Gary Paulsen is my favorite favorite author. He wrote this so great a lot of detail. Also I rated this a four because I think it should have had a better ending.
5,Sailing Away on Words,I like this book. It's a great book .If you like sailboats you will like this book. It's about Gary Paulsen on his sailboats. Gary Paulsen is a great writer. I recommend this book for you.
5,How good can it get?,"I have owned many grills and the Weber is without a doubt the best. I have roasted Thanksgiving and Christmas turkeys on the grill and numerous cuts of pork (fresh hams,loins, butts etc.)and all were excellent. Don't get me started! I cannot think of anything I would change about this grill."
5,awesome paddle,i love this paddle. i use it all the time and recommend it to others. it is light-weight and the size is absolutely perfect for me (I am a girl) so it is not too heavy or big.
3,Not for beginners,"This racket is too stiff and does not have too much power. I would recommend it for adults or advanced players, who would really like to try something to control the ball"
3,Not perfect fit. Tighter than expected.,"Although these slides were Aerosoles and they generally have perfect fit and are comfortable, these were a bit tight. The elastic band on top did not provide enough space."
4,looks good,"I bought this shoe for my wife, I like the slip on wedges. She says it feels comfortable and she likes the look. nice to go out in the summer feel."
3,"pretty good...if you're a GA fan, you'll like it","Lovebox is typical to the std style and layout of GA cd's...they have upbeat tracks, they have downtempo tracks...sometimes you listen to one type, other times the other...this cd is no exception to that rule...some notable tracks:think twice -downtempofinal shakedown - upbeatlovebox - upbeatremember - downtempothe rest of the tracks I didn't like...maybe it was the poor reggae vocals or style of the track that didn't make sense to me....but how many cd's do you have where you can really stand behind EVERY track? So, it's good, but 'goodbye country' and 'vertigo' are better I think. See if you can find this on Amazon UK to listen to something and see for yourself?"
4,Their best Work Yet,"The GA boys are back again. They must be given credit for releasing a new album so soon after the last (Goodbye Country.....). This is GA's best work yet. A more varied album than previous and much better for it. There is a much more upbeat vibe going on. 3 great house tracks really lift the record (Final Shakedown,Easy,Lovebox). 2 rocking tracks (Purple Haze and Madder) show a new direction and both are executed brilliantly. Madder bounces along and will sound great live. 2 of the mellow tracks feature Neneh Cherry and are very laidback. The boys still know how to relax you. With pianos, strings, horns and a very live sound they work well. Overall a quality record and definitely check them out on tour."
3,The New Album,Sorry not impressed with this one. I love the fusion of different types of music and especially like tracks 11 & 12 but the rap in the first couple of songs were a real disappointment. God i hate rap/hip hop! Maybe i'll warm to it but i doubt it. Not half as good as the last GA.
3,Leaves a sooty residue and flavor,"The shallow grease collection pan/tray in the underside seems to be too close to the grill so that if you grill anything with even minimal fat, it flares up into a flame and leaves a decidedly sooty taste on the food. Adding to the sooty residue and flavor is the shape of the sides of the grill which slope inwards and bring the sides of the grill too close to the heat source which heat the drippings and catch fire. The electronic igniter was no better than the one on cheaper models - it broke before its first summer was over. After 30 years of grilling with gas/propane grills this is pretty unpleasant. I really wish I had not gotten this grill."
5,Jacks' A Star,"This is the 1st solo effort from the longtime Virgin Steele guitarist. With guest appearences by Riot lead singer Rhett Forrester on all songs (who since has passed on). Carl Canedy from the Rods on drums. This whole cd just rocks. Jack lets it all hang out on the first track ""Concrete Warrior"", and does not let up at all. My favorite song is ""Wild in the Streets"" a mid-tempo heavy riffed-up tune with an awesome solo. If you can find this cd pick it up, you will not regret it. His best to date."
5,Really spruces up the bare white walls of my apartment,"Cool vintage Guinness ad now makes my kitchen look sophisticated and cool. The ""My Goodness, My Guinness"" posters are cheaper (by a couple bucks) to the penny-pinchers but you shouldn't skimp on quality toucan. Goes great with the Guinness in my fridge, too. Now the centerpiece of my bachelor apartment, my friends often comment on how great it looks while we drink beer and watch Wes Anderson movies."
2,Poor Image Resolution,"Great price, but terrible image resolution. It looks fine from 10 feet away, any closer and you'll notice the blockiness of the scaled low-res image."
3,good,"Good u have too make like 20 holes on ur tailgate, or just use more double face tape. Or use tape and holes"
4,Soft Book for Little Ones,"I bought this book for my twin grandchildren (now 9 months old). The four pages for photos were just right for mommy, daddy, and one for each baby. Of course, the book goes in their mouths first. They do turn the pages and look at the photos. I think that they will discover how to remove the photos from under the plastic page soon."
3,XXX,"The music is strange but enjoyable and especially love the photos of Jenna Jameson, she is awesome!"
2,wrong one,i got the wrong ones. the size for the makita is good but the male threads didnt match the brushes. my error i think
4,Some memorable characters & an engaging plot! We loved it!,"The only problem we had with it is the main character, Bernard Fine, is just too wonderful to be true!"
2,Danielle Steele,"Forgot how D. Steele movies were so ""steamy"". There is some nudity and language that I didn't care to hear."
3,Great bag-will not fit Nikon d300 with 18-200vr,Very nice high quality bag-esp if great protection is what you are looking for. But like the previous reviewer this bag is smaller than the dimensions suggest. I could not use my Nikon d300 with 18-200vr in it.
2,If your 8-13yrs of age you might enjoy it...,"It's a VERY quick read 30-60 minutes depending on if you are a speed reader or an adult. I'm sure there are probably other books out there that go into more graphic detail about the haunting that are brought up in this book, but this one IS for children so I`m sure they`ve toned it down a lot. I've reread it now and gotten it out of my system, and see no reason for me to read it again, there just is no reread value to it. I can find better stories with better detailed experiences of ghosts and the supernatural then this one. So bottom line, its good for kids 8-13yrs of age, but not adults. If you want a more in-depth review, please visit my profile and visit my horror movie/book blog."
5,Excellent Example of a Variety of Stories,"I read this book as an elementary school student in California back in 1980 or 1981. I have been searching for it ever since with no avail. I was very impressed withe the content of the book as history as well as for it's value having to do with Ghosts themselves. In my adult life, I have recounted many of the stories from this book as historical information as a matter of discussion with other peers as well as with other children; inclusing my own step-children. I hope they have found these stories as entertaining and interesting as I did. They made a distinct mark on me as a child which I have never forgotten, and hopefully neither will they..."
2,Ultimately Just Dull,"This sounds like it could be really cool, in a David Lynch sort of way..., but strangely, after a couple of listens it becomes very irritating. The sound quality is pretty awful. Sometimes it comes across as exploitative (at least that's what I thought). This is one of those CD's you pull out when company comes over, but since it's nearly impossible to listen to an entire song you might want to save your money."
2,Not all it's been reported to be.,"I'm a rather hip elementary music teacher. I was hoping to be inspired by this cd and delve into penning arrangements of unusual choices. The cd was a big disappointment. Really. I tend to get excited by unusual things that are done well. This isn't done that well. I've been too bored to listen to this all the way through, and have tried a few times. I like the idea very much, but the execution just isn't there. Too bad. It really was a good idea. I'll still do some arrangements."
1,Something to Avoid,"I got this one after watching the VH1 documentary. I got it and listened to it and utterly hated it. Do yourself a favor and simply stick to the original artists. This is an oddity to be briefly listened to at parties and then wisely, and quickly forgotten."
1,"A Novelty item only. After 1 listen, it's lost its charm","Seriously, I challenge anyway to listen to this more than once. Cool concept, (I guess), but there's far better music out there. I'm sorry I spent $ on this. The only redeemable quality is the photos in the cd booklet; specifically, the 12-year oldish Charles Manson Family looking girl holding the oversized bass guitar."
1,The Brady Kids in Disguise,"Absolutely, positively, HORRIBLE! Just listen to the sound samples and hear for yourself. I had heard good things about this album. Someone obviously has a screw loose to think this was good enough for release.Bru-ther."
2,My wife hated it,"It looks like this has received nothing but raves and five stars from the listeners here so, for some balance and perspective, I am giving it two stars. Like you, I was all hyped up to get my hands on this cd, expecting the best/weirdest/some kind of musical miracle. By the third song or so my wife wasn't amused, or enchanted by this kid's choir doing Wings and Barry Manilow covers. As for me, I like it, it's okay, I appreciate what they were doing and find it charming that these children were singing their little hearts out and playing bass guitars bigger than they were, but, it's not that great. Even my toddler son seemed to lose interest, if you can imagine that, after the first song or so (he who is transfixed by the Beatles ""Because"" and the wonderful You are My Flower cd by the band Ida). I love the songs they cover and I must say they do a splendid job with Band on the Run. But I don't see listening to this all that much, at least not with my wife around."
2,this is the album you wish was good...,"the concept is great the execution is terrible...for one thing the acoustics are really bland and washed out. it sounds like someone taped it onto a cheap tape player. if the people who came up with the concept followed through with a little effort this could have been amazing... and that is what makes you grit your teeth, thinking that this could have been something...."
1,Innocent and Despairing,"OK, so the music teacher didn't really know what he was supposed to be teaching, the kids just sang what they wanted, a few instruments were provided, the recording facilities were rudimentary and...BIG HIT, GREAT SENSATION etc. etc. I got the album for Christmas and knew nothing about this supposed phenomenon as I live on another continent. Reading the blurbs, I got quite enthusiastic but listening was another story. Not exactly recommended music to digest your Christmas dinner! My son pleaded with me to turn it off, the dog left the room and I was left wincing. They call this ""outsider music"" because if you play it inside you do so at your own risk. Just because it's old doesn't mean it's good. And, it's not particularly old, either. It's pretty awful."
2,"Oh, how charming... not!","Because of all the laudatory, gushing comments from other reviewers, I gave this as a Christmas present to my 25-year-old daughter who now lives in Canada, and I was a bit embarrassed that I made such a poor choice. I've been to dozens of school chorus performances as my four daughters went through elementary school, and many of them were more creative and enjoyable than hearing these bewildered kids mumble through pop lyrics in an echo-y gym. Maybe it's touching and sweet to hear kids sing rock songs about anguish and lost love, or maybe it's a bit cynical and manipulative."
4,Beauty and Discipline.,"C'mon, drop the cynicism and faux-hipness long enough to listen to this reminder of a purer time. Remember when you were 9, 10, 11 years old? Kudos to the kids' teacher for drawing from them this wonderfully simple and nostalgic recording. Melodic, shy, off-key at times, earnest and fun, this gem of past-pop covers belongs on every collectors shelf. There's a wistful quality to most of the cuts. And you can tell the kids aren't American by their disciplined approach (you can actually distinguish the words), and they make an honest effort to sing in unison. What a find! It's impossible to listen to ""Desperado"" only once."
3,The title tells the story,"Innocence and Despair is an apt title for this cd. I personally think this is a five star album but only gave it three stars because it isn't for everyone. The lo-fi production and, at times, off key harmonies might turn a lot of people off. However, if you stick with it, this cd will get into your psyche. These kids sing without pretense and offer an illuminating take on some well known tunes from the seventies. The opening refrain of ""Band on the Run"" is so forlorn it's beautiful. Kinda like ""After the Goldrush"" era Neil Young."
4,Everything you've heard is true.,"This is a beautiful CD, at once humorous, and then desperate. A welcome addition to my collection of outsider music, but also fabulous in its own right.And yes, this may be *the* difinitive version of 'Desperado'."
2,"Love the Popcorn, but the bag burns","The small bag is a perfect size for when you're only sharing with one person or you just want a quick snack.The popcorn is a little greasy, but it's sooo delicious.The one (BIG) problem I have is that the bag tends to burn, I don't know if this is something I'm doing wrong, but I hate it.The first time I made it: bag super burnt and popcorn didn't make, bag did not even inflate. Second time I made it, worked fine. Third time, bag burnt, butter melted, big mess.My microwave works fine with other popcorn, so not sure what is wrong."
4,Great Size,I love the popcorn and even better is the size bag. Just enough for me and my two year old to share.
5,Great tasting pop corn,I like this so much I have it programed for auto delivery. You can't go wrong with Orville.
1,Grossly misunderstand / oversimplifies what therapy is- Unconvincing!,"In order to make their argument, the authors have grossly simplified and misrepresented the entire practice and philosophy of psychotherapy. The complexity of psychotherapy is reduced to a mere enemy who they relentlessly attack, sometimes without much rational arguments.I got the book hoping to read about something insightful regarding the pros and cons of psychotherapy. The premise, of course, is a thorough understanding of the whole concept of psychotherapy in the first place. But the book disappointed me greatly. It is more about right-winged, conservative ""American Creed"" sort of advocacy - highly politically-motivated - than about psychology or psychotherapy itself.If you are looking for an insightful analysis of the current facets of psychotherapy, this is NOT the book."
3,Pretending to be in the know,"The authors of this novel appear to be setting up straw arguments to knock them down and appear as if they have discovered some shamefully hidden secrets of the therapeutic profession. In reality, few professionals profess to the extreme points of view these authors present as mainstream and modern mental health care professionals would rarely allow these attitudes to persist in their patients for long without pointing out the need for personal responsibility to overcome whatever life probelms they are encountering."
3,Too polemical,"I generally agree with the thesis that there is an identifiably ideology that can be termed therapism, and that it is problematic. I take issue with the polemical approach the authors take, however. I enjoyed the great anecdotes, but the authors never get beyond anecdotal lines of argument. This was particularly evident in the chapter regarding the Catholic priests and child molestation. The authors present therapism as being singularly responsible for the church's anemic response towards their priests' misdeeds, while ignoring other ideologies or concepts that played a role. The insistence in mapping on therapism to every social ill, to the exclusion of every other cultural phenomena, became tiresome after a while."
1,What a Total Crock Is This,"God keep all Vietnam Vets away from these people. Oh, and Gulf War I vets. And current Gulf War II vets. And firemen and policemen and EMTs from 9/11 and Oklahoma City. Because these ladies don't have a CLUE about treating anyone for anything.Running only on the empty fumes of rightwing cant, this is pure polemic masquerading as professionalism. Feh.Save your money. Instead, buy ""Trauma & Recovery"" by Judith Lewis Herman, M.D., a clinician who actually knows what she's talking about, unlike these two loudmouth featherweight partisan hacks."
1,Bad and wrong in so many ways,"The ways in which the authors have come to the wrong conclusions in this book are almost too numerous to mention. Thankfully, many of the reviews here take a stab at enumerating some of them. I'll only add this: the authors seem to think that in order to be successful and accomplished, one must be competitive. Funny, I always thought that in order to be successful, you usually have to work hard and learn how to be good at what you do. You don't have to ""beat"" anybody else - you just need to be good at what you do and then do it. Yes, of course the world is a competitive place, but there's no reason for us to reinforce that in our children. Heaven forbid we could raise a generation of people who were sensitive and supportive! They might be less inclined to support a policy of killing people in other countries and where would THAT leave us?!"
4,Good service,"The book showed up in the promised condition. It did take a little longer to receive it than I anticipated, but it was still within the promised parameters for delivery."
5,Weber One-Touch Gold is a Terrific Grill,"We've been using Weber grills for years and the One-Touch Gold is the best yet. Cooks well, durable and easy to clean with the one touch/ash catcher combo. Cooks better than propane units and as easy, if not easier, to use. Start the charcoal with a chimmey unit (Weber makes a nice one for about $15)- No starter fluid or electric coils --, buy the charcoal (Kingsford) at warehouse clubs & home centers -- 48# for $10, and you're good to go. Weber has terrific customer service too -- phone and web."
1,Beware of the chipped Porcelain,"Listen I can't attest to the greatness of this grill as all the previous reviewers have claimed, sadly because I haven't been able to get to the grilling part. My first order arrived with chipped porcelain and a squashed handle and after I called back the customer service rep was quick to offer a replacement, but alas there were none in stock... An hour later the grill reappeared I called and Bam a replacement was sent. I got the new one and De;Javu, same chip same handle, different grill. I am not the first customer to get this. So beware of the defective grills in this series. I am going to go look for one in person instead of playing Russian roulette again with Amazon, if only they can personally check them before sending..."
1,Poor packaging,"I received this grill in damaged condition TWICE. One of the handles was bent and cracked and a large chunk was taken out of the ceramic on the lid on BOTH grills. So, either poor handling or poor packaging or a combination there of.I cannot rate the performance since I am yet to get one that is in good condition. I have ordered another color hoping that it is coming from a different distribution center. So we ill see.Amazon handled the issue poorly and required me to pay up front for the second time I re-ordered. They are processing a refund, but it seems an unnecessary hassle."
2,Disappointing damage,"This is at least the second time I have reviewed this product. The product, a Weber One Touch Gold was received badly damaged due to improper packaging. The product itself looked like it would have been good, but it would not have lasted any time due to the numerous chips in the porcelain enamel. I got a full refund, but I was disappointed. I had planned on using it that weekend."
3,Weber grill,"We love the ash removal system on this Weber, but miss the cover-hanger, thermometer, and wood handles of the older Weber 22 1/2"" one touch. I purchased my 1st. one in 1989, (which we use almost nightly and is still in pristine condition), and bought this one for our summer home, hoping for the same quality and features."
5,5 Stars,Love the ash catcher. Well worth the extra $50. The grill speaks for itself. My last surviver 10 years stored outdoors and used about three times a week for seven months a year.
4,Zero for 2,"This is my second Weber grill purchased from Amazon, the first was Weber 3721001 Spirit E-310 ordered May 12, 2008. The Spirit had a damaged part that prevented use of the grill and a ten day wait for the part and the new One Touch is missing a leg. This is poor quality control. Other than that the product works as promised."
1,Weber One Touch Gold - Blue BBQ grill,"I had to have my original item shipped back because of significant scratches/dings on the lid, which would have definitely rusted over time.When I received the 2nd/replacement shipment, there were no scratches, however the lid did not fit snug and tight.I didn't bother shipping the 2nd item I received back to you.I can deal with the lid being a little bit loose, but these items were posted as ""Brand New"" and I'm not sure that these really are new.My guess is that these may be factory blemished items."
2,"Looks good, but poor construction","We bought this as a gift for someone, and based on Weber's reputation, we were confident that this would be a top of the line gift. The color is cobalt blue that is extremely distinctive. The problem is that the wheels keep falling off. When the 1st wheel fell off, we thought it was assembler error. When the 2nd wheel fell off and then the 1st wheel fell off again, it became a concern. Keep in mind that the grill was just sitting there until we were ready to give it to the person. What would happen once the grill was being used? The bottom line is that we didn't have time to return the grill and get another, so before we gave the grill to the person, we bought caps for the back legs, and put the wheels inside. It was passable, but not up to Weber standards. I just hope that the rest of the grill holds together for the recipient.If you want a stationary grill that looks great......."
5,smokey joe grill,smokey joe grills from weber are all you need....use charcoal for the best flavor and are relatively inexpensive
2,Highly Disappointed,"This may be a great grill, but unfortunately I never had a chance to find out. I ordered one from Amazon and it arrived damaged. The porcelain was scaped off of the metal during transport and this was too expensive an item to keep with several inches of missing porcelain. Since I was able to see the unexposed metal, I can report that it looked like the sort of very cheap metal that would quickly rust if even a tiny chip was to develop.Amazon was good about returning it and they sent out another. Unfortunately the replacement was left by UPS in a major rainstorm and I came home to a major mess. I had them pick it up.I honestly don't know if I would have tried a third time. I was having a party later that week and went to a local store. They only had the Weber grill in black and so I ended up with a lesser charcoal grill in vibrant red. I really liked the looks of the blue porcelain, but ended up saving over $100...and the one I bought cooks great."
4,Nice Grill,"This is actually my 3rd purchase of this Weber model. I grill almost every night all year round so it gets a workout. Be aware that the packaging could be better. This one and the previous one I ordered from Amazon 3 years ago, both had minor damage to the grill lid."
5,Quality Grill,"I'm very happy with my new grill from Weber. Fit and finish are excellent and you can't beat the ash collector at the bottom. In a perfect world, the blue would be a little darker as it looks closer to purple. All in all, the guy's night out was a complete success as the steaks were perfect."
5,EXCELLENT MULTI-PURPOSE GRILL!,"Weber 758001 22-1/2-Inch One-Touch Gold Charcoal Grill, BlueI've had this grill for a couple of years now and I am still impressed with the excellent food that comes off of it. I can make some deliciousmedium rare fillets with this grill using charcoal offset to one side. Same with chicken. I just bought a Smokenator 1000 used exclusively for the 22.5 inch kettle. This device turns the grill into a low and slow water smoker. My first batch of ribs were fantastic. Just did a pork butt yesterday and it was also excellent. I highly recommend this product,the grill and smokenator 1000, buy it you won't regret it!!!"
3,"good item, image is wrong","This grill is great, easy to load, easy to clean up with the ash catcher. Attractive, but be warned the picture is very misleading, the actual blue color is much duller than shown here. Also, i must deduct a star for the tripod stand. It is a little too flimsy to be holding hot coals..."
1,Arrived damaged and it's not blue,"The original grill and its replacment were damaged. Both lids had large dents at the lip of the lid and were missing paint.BTW, the grill is a blue-violet...looked like periwinkle to me. Not the color I was expecting. I now know why I've never seen this model in a store."
4,"WEBER 22 1/2""","WEBER MAKES A FANTASTIC PRODUCT. I'VE HAD MANY OVER MY YEARS, BUT THE LARGE ONES SEEM TO HAVE THE SAME ISSUE. THEY HAVE NOT FIXED THE LEGS TO STAY ON. I RECENTLY WORE OUT AN 18"" WEBER, HENCE THE PURCHASE OF THIS 22 1/2"". ONCE TOGETHER,AND AFTER COALS WERE HOT, I TRIED TO ROLL B-B-Q OVER TO ANOTHER SPOT AND (2) LEGS FELL OFF. IMAGINE MY SHOCK, STANDING THERE HOLDING THE UNIT WITH ONE LEG, HOT, WHILE HUBBY TRIED TO REATTACH THESE LEGS. THIS TIME, BEFORE USE, WE SCREWED THE LEGS ON. TWO SIMPLE SCREWS DO THE TRICK. MAYBE WEBER WILL READ THIS REVIEW, HUH?"
4,Watch the focused heat.......,"Same amount of charcoal that I used on my Lodge Hibachi (which I still love, but now don't use) generates a much more intense focused heat. I guess it's because of the shape. The ash remover is a great feature and I use a wooden spoon to sweep out the ash into the receptacle. I am careful not to scratch the enamel because that would eventually be a rust spot. I still haven't tried my beer can chicken yet though. I need to see if there is enough room under the cover to stand my chicken up. THANK GOD IT'S MADE IN THE USA AND NOT CHINA......Quality right out of the box is great. I should have rated it 5 stars, but I think that I long for either cast iron or thick stainless steel, but then I am in the 600-1000 dollar range. I am very happy with this. It was my 54 birthday present to myself. GO AMAZON....!"
3,Not as good as it seems,"I have had the Weber grill all summer and I can honestly say it is one of the best on the market. Most of that because there isn't much competition. The Weber grill is VERY top heavy and the flimsy tripod stand will not allow you to move the grill only a few feet and it wants to tip or collapse upon itself. The legs just loose slip into some holes on the bottom of the grill. I didn't have the grill together for 5 minutes and it fell over and cracked part of the blue coating off the top. It chips like porcelain and is unfixable. The wheels are flimsy and useless also. The inside of the grill is painted with some kind of black paint that peels off and can get on your food. The cleanout feature on the bottom is nice. I like the side thing that will hold the lid and the utensil thing as well. Don't get a side shelf of any kind or you will be grilling on the ground. Overall, it cooks well and has a nice grill but I give -5 stars to the tripod."
1,"weber grill ,blue","I bought this item from Amazon. Big mistake, both handles bent, paint missing ,no assembly instuctions.I believe it was a return. I don`t think Weber would sell something like this to the public. If they would it is not good for pr. I would never pay this much for a weber product again. shop walmart it`s cheaper!!!"
3,Why change perfection?,"I thought my previous Weber Charcoal Grill was the best grill made. I lived by the temperature gauge and could make quick adjustments because the wooden handles never got hot. These 2 important features were left off this model and for the life of me, I can't understand why. My personal color preference was red but the blue will cook the same, just not as stylish."
5,Perfect!,"This is a great grill! I have cooked chicken, steaks, ribs, meatloaf, brats all with great results! This grill also cooks better in windy conditions than the One Touch Silver."
5,Birthday present to me...,"Bought this grill as a present to me as I was tired of a lack of taste on a gas grill. The Weber is easy to set up and use. What a difference grilling over mesquite charcoal, using wood chips to add smoky flavors. Weber air controls are easy to use to manage temperature and the bucket attached at the bottom makes cleanup easy. Great purchase."
2,definitely not the same,"This grill is not the same quality as the original made in US Weber grill that we had for years. Maybe that is an unfair standard (these are made in China), but we at least expected the parts to fit together correctly."
5,Phenomenal product,"This is a beautiful charcoal grill with a terrific cleaning system that will be heavily used in my home for many years to come. It arrived in perfect condition via Amazon with no scratches or dents, and it was very easy to put together. I wish it had a built-in thermometer in the lid, but I'll drill a hole and install one myself. Thank you, Weber! You've done it again."
5,Great grill...,"Weber 758001 22.5-Inch One-Touch Gold Charcoal Grill, BlueIt's well made, it's Weber, and it's blue. It was very easy to put together. There's not many parts in the box. The second day I had it I did a beer can chicken that came out great. It couldn't have been easier with this grill. One of the things that's great is that there is actually an aftermarket for Weber. You can buy iron grates and smoker contraptions like the smokenator so it's very flexible. Another thing is that it's a nice sized grill, but if you're cooking for a crowd, best to choose a bigger model. I made the right choice for me."
4,Enamel started chipping after a year,This was an awesome item for about a year. The blue paint started chipping (flaking) off due to the charcoal heat. I was very bummed. The product still worked but looked horrible. I contacted Weber and the customer service dept. was great! They sent out a replacement bowl within a few days. The enamel is not covered under the warranty but Weber took care of it anyway. I am thrilled at the great customer service I received. Long time fan of Weber product and will be for a long time!
5,First Father's Day :-),"I bought this grill as a Father's Day present for my husband. It came in perfect condition; no chips, dings or peeling enamel and is a fantastic color (he calls it ""Cubbie blue""). The assembly was quick and easy, together in about 10 minutes(with a few minor mistakes). We have been using it every weekend since and he couldn't be happier with it! Great grill, we both highly recommend it."
2,"No cover bracket, no thermometer","My husband will cook on no grill other than a Weber kettle, and we looked at this one versus the Performer. Just brought home the new 22.5"" one touch gold, since we decided we didn't need the gas starter, the attached table or charcoal bin. The two features I didn't realize we were losing from the 10-year old kettle we're replacing are the the cradle-bracket that holds the top when you take off the cover, and the thermometer which was part of the cover. I'm a little upset that we spent what we did, to have those features NOT INCLUDED. Will be returning it for the Performer, I guess, but we're not happy campers. I hate to support a company that makes you pay an ultra-premium price in a newer model just to have the features that you've always had."
5,How Good?,This is a great BBQ cooker. I had one 25 years ago and sold at a garage sale for $20.00 because I went gas. 5 Gas grills later I went back to the kettle cooker. I've had my kettle cooker for about 5 months now. Bought it here from Amazon. It is a all round great unit if you like to BBQ. You must love to BBQ. Indirect or direct cooking. I like to sear steaks with coals about a inch from meat for one minute then move to side and cover till done. Its pretty versatile any way you want to cook. The cleaning system works good. For long cooks or smokes the unit has to be tended. It's a skill. You have to like to BBQ for long cooks but that is OK a case of Bud ice cold works good for long cooks. In the end how good?. Five stars.
3,Slight damage,"Although the product arrived at my in-laws in an intact box, it was obvious the grill had been dropped at some point. The outer gray handle had paint chipping where it attached to the grill and on the inside of the grill, you could see an indention in the metal where the grill had been dropped on the handle."
1,"Size incorrect bag not 5"" D","This is a nice bag for the money. However if you are looking for a 5""D bag to fit on small airplanes, this bag is not the size advertized. It is at least 9""D."
2,Should have thought twice,"I should have done a little more research before buying. The unit does not come with the mounting brackets (there are two: one for existing, and one for new construction). The only seller I've found for the new construction is special order, requiring up to 30 days for delivery. I have yet to find the existing construction bracket for sale anywhere..... Looks like I'll have to waste time trying to fabricate something, I'm not going to wait 30 days to finish the install."
1,Not a DSLR Camera Bag,"I should have listened to the previous review. The bag is WAY too small for any digital SLR camera. Even though my camera is one of the smallest SLR's (Canon XTi), it didn't even come close to fitting in this bag."
3,Too small for SLR,"This would be a great bag, but it is much too small for the Nikon D80 and I am sure it is too small for most other DSLRs.Too bad really because it is well thought out except for the size."
1,good bag bad size,"this bag is much to small to hold an SLR camera. i was very disapointed. For the short while i used it i had to take apart my camera everytime i used it, and was unable to have a strap on it. it work well if you had a small camera, such as a click and shoot."
2,Too small for real DSLR cameras,"this wouldve been a great bag if the specs for its size were actually true.i wanted to travel light and carry just the camera and lens. after taking measurements from my Rebel XT + nifty fifty lens, and comparing several bags for size and looks, i figure this would be a great fit at a good price.well, the price is good, but the fit is horrible. it shouldnt be advertised as a DSLR bag at all, as it can barely fit the body, let alone body+lens as shown on their website, even after removing the little divider it comes with.i really dont know how they get their interior measurements, as its just very misleading. its not even worth the money to resell this, as the shipping will probably cost more than the bag is worth. i shouldve stayed with lowepro; at least their measurements were more accurate for when i owned an FZ18"
3,Not for the Mathmatically Challenged,"If you liked ""The Road to reality"" and have an understanding of the Mathmatics of Quantum Physics and Relativity then you will enjoy this book. Otherwise don't bother."
2,an incredible bore,"Lots of sui generis formulas, much more philosophy than science, and above all, old (1994).Get a nice science book from either author and you will be a lot better off, and learn much more.Formulas include expression as (over here) + (over there) . Not useful at all."
4,Sweet,"The complexity of space and time easily transcribed, though a more laymens terms kind of explaination would have been more interesting."
5,The best read I have had on network design in years!,"As a 15 year veteran of the computer industry specializing in networks and software development I have read more than my share of network design books. Eric's is the best I have come across and I whole heartedly recommend it to IS Managers and Network Designers. I especially liked the way Eric addressed the important topics of TCP/IP, SSL, Corba, COM, and some of my personal favorite topics such as ADO, ODBC and Transaction Server. Eric's experience as a pioneer in networks really shows in this comprehensive book. Well Done!"
3,Advanced Wicca,"Basic guidelines for personal goal setting by incorporating the qualities of the elements and Spirit and life's cycles into daily living. Once you understand his concepts of Expression and Envelopment, you're on the path to touching every aspect of Living Paganism, within and without."
5,Becoming connected to the cycles of life,"Shanddaramon's LIVING PAGANISM: AN ADVANCED GUIDE FOR THE SOLITARY PRACTITIONER tells practitioners how to use connecting spiritual practices to become more connected to cycles of life. From learning how to develop Pagan spiritual goals to becoming an active participant in cosmic cycles, LIVING PAGANISM continues Shanddaramon's teachings, begun in SELF-INITIATION FOR THE SOLITARY WITCH."
4,Had mine for a year now...,"I bought mine from Home Depot. They have the black usually in stock but I had them special order a blue one. There was no additional shipping charge. It took a while to get used to the amount of heat it puts out, so upon your first couple of cookouts, set the dial lower than you think. Setup was ok. One of the side-tables didn't go on right because the hole in the table didn't line up with the hole in the frame. I do have two major complaints: 1. The front of the grill gets HOT, so you'll still have to keep your small kids away (when is anyone going to design a grill with a heat guard???); 2. The lid makes a loud creaking noise when its openned and closed. The only other comment I have is, only get the Silver C if you REALLY need the side burner. I should have bought the Silver B for less."
4,A good read,"I'm having to read this book for a class, but I've found that it's really helpful. It talks about the structure of different Psalms and has information that I would have never seen on my own. I also didn't think it was too dense or academic to follow while still giving me good information."
4,The Psalms - Westermann,"the text was very easy to read and to fillow. Author presents a fine scholastice presentation. At the same time, it is very user friendly."
2,I don't speak spanish,"The VHS arrived in good condition. When I watched the video the spanish-language stubtitles were a major distraction. Unlike a dvd, I cannot remove the subtitles. I emailed the seller requesting a version without Spanish-language subtitles and heard nothing back. Never again will I use this seller."
1,not very good,"this was not what I expected. I found it to be uninspiring, slow, and ho hum. My kids were not engaged at all."
1,A disappointment - save $ and make up your own,"I'm listening to the songs as I type this, and trying to understand how anybody thought these were songs that children might enjoy. I feel relieved that I got it free in a Scholastic sale - but still... I can't help feeling ripped off. Scholastic has so many good resources, including CD-and-book combos, including Sing and Learn Around the Year, which I bought in the same sale, but still - avoid this CD. You can make up catchier songs than this, I promise."
5,definitive bio of 18th C English portrait painter,"The author has discovered the life behind the art during years of research. He consulted original documents and living descendents. Including one color and many b&w plates, the large format hard bound volume covers Highmore's prosperous and well educated youth, his art, his family, and his courage as a Christian freethinker."
5,Fish Lover,"It was perfect, it was easy to install. It is self explanatory, the bio-wheel just goes in the little grooves and then when you plug in the pump it twirls."
5,This book impacted my outlook.,"Compared to other sci-fi authors, Mac Tonnies ranks with P.K. Dick, William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, and Bruce Sterling. He is thought-pivotingly original. If you wallow in science fiction like I do, you'll eat this book up.In this short 133-page book, Tonnies' ethereal ideas strikingly contribute to the advance of science fiction.In the introductory story, ""Reflections of a Specimen,"" Tonnies wow-ed me with a new take on clique leaders. He launches into a seeming takeoff on William Gibson's style yet holds his own by injecting his own provoking vision. The other stories in this book are just as juicy. There's no way you can have a favorite because they're all so invitingly well-developed and original. Absolutely fantastic.This is a book come before its time."
5,More features than a mini ipod,"I bought this instead of a mini ipod. I used a friends mini for a while, but this is a better value. It comes with a radio, color screen, an internal microphone so you can record and you can download pics and text to it. It also comes with a protective cover that has a clip, which is great for music on the go. It comes in handy when I exercise. This is a fun little toy."
3,Oh dear God......!,"Every so often a movie is sooooooo bad that it almost becomes art. Think of Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". Iron Warrior is that bad. Or that good. Try to imagine a Conan the Barbarian clone made with a budget of $30. The ""plot"" consists of unrelated chase scenes (many, many chases), REALLY bad battle scenes, and (JOY!) gratuitous nudity. The thing is, this movie is so unbelieveably bad that it is unintentionally hilarious. I watched this at 2:00 AM one day and found myself laughing hystericaly. The hairstyles alone are worthy of a chuckle. This movie will NEVER see an academy award, but in spite of everything, it is entertaining. So, 3 stars for the laughs, and 1/2 a star for everything else."
2,Well...,"I'd give this some grief for being made in the late 80's >_< Well, it's basically a story....about...a warrior...that's protecting a princess called ""Jenna"" that for some reason manages to get her torso naked everytime someone tries to attack her...someone over the age of ten can figure out the plot and the ending after watching it for about twenty minutes. But as I said, it was made in the 80's so everything that we think would be a cliche today, wasn't back then. Anyway, I gave this a 2 star rating because I love Miles O'Keefe's armor design and the way his hair is set up...great for artistic values. This film dissapointed me and I wondered why I wasted money to rent it...but the setting's nice and the way the characters look (armor design, clothes...) are very artistic. Cheers."
1,I would rather die then watch this movie,This movie is so bad! I couldn't even watch it! If there is one thing you should do before you die it is not to watch this movie! This movie is a disgrace to the Ator series.
2,Way overpriced..........,A collection of way overpriced RW videos............that you can get in the bargin bins at Walmart for $5 each.
2,Great for New Users,"I expected more of this book and CD than they provided. If you're a new PowerPoint user, this is a good resource for the basics. If you're accustomed to using PowerPoint, and you've done presentations before, this book doesn't have much to offer beyond the usual recommendations, e.g., keep it brief, only so many lines per slide, etc. I would suggest you check this book out of the library rather than buy it."
5,point click wow,"As a university professor that gives lectures to a wide variety of audiences, in the USA and abroad, this book takes a step-by-step approach to becoming an even more effective speaker. It begins by helping you think through your strategy and provides even the most polished speaker with new tactics and small but so thoughtful tips about using PowerPoint and organizing slide shows. Given the importance of making persuasive presentations, this should be required reading for every manager. I would particularly recommend it for MBA students. They will learn how to give an effective, professional presentation to executives."
5,Great source!,"A pretty presentation does not mean it is a good presentation. This book does not just address look but also content and preparation. This is an excellent resoure for professionals (or students) who need to get their ideas across to an audience. It is very well laid out and does not just address how to create the look of a presentation. It does a great job on the importance of preparation, knowing your audience, and being prepared for all eventualities (expected and unexpected."
3,Walcott Part One,"Charles Doolittle Walcott was a great man... a hard working, self taught scientist and dedicated administrator. Unfortunately, in Yochelson's overblown biography we are subjected to detailed descriptions of every ailment suffered by Walcott and his immediate family and after 468 pages are abruptly told that the final 20 years of his life constitutes another story. The two decades that include Walcott's tenure as Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution represents a period that would certainly be of greater interest to most readers than the day-planner chronology that occurs here. At times, Yochelson had this reader captivated with accounts of Walcott's Cambrian discoveries with a fine presentation of the rigors of fieldwork in the remote west of the late 1890's. Most fossil collectors and armchair paleontologists will enjoy these sections. I only wish the bulk of this biography was equally compelling and completed the story of Walcott's remarkable life."
1,broken hammock,"The ropes on this hammock broke only after 2 weeks of use. Luckily, my husband is handy and googled how to restring a hammock. But, overall, it was a disappointing Father's Day present."
5,great product,I was very happy to find this replacement for my old hammock!! solid materials and construction for a reasonable price. the company was helpful in selecting the appropriate replacement for my old hammock frame.
1,Disappointed,"I needed this to replace my VHS copy as Leslie Sansone only released 3 workouts for her version of an exercise step & this was the best of the 3. However disc would not run at all & while Amazon was kind enough to refund my money past the 30 day period, I nevertheless still don't have this workout."
4,"Nice, but...","I ordered these diapers as burp rags and they really shrank. Although the website clearly states that they will shrink, I was just a little surprised at how much they shrank.The up side is that they are soft and absorbant for the use as a burp rag; albeit a little small for my taste.Spend the cash and by the largest size possible."
3,Varying validity,"Intriguing mechanizations combine textured white noise with perfunctory idm beats, offering a worthwhile sampler but a lesser version of more fully realized output."
3,Not the best Arovane release,"If you are considering this because you enjoy Arovane, or are curious, I believe this is their least moving release. Start with any of their other titles."
1,cute but breakable,I bought this toy for my 4 yr old grandaughter. She really liked it but where the house is hinged in the middle it won't stay together. She was very disappointed and doesn't like to play with toys that do not work like they are suppost to.
5,Price Toooooooooo HIGH!,"These are fine bar and chain combos but this particular one can be found at other sellers for around $35.00, I recommend looking elsewhere."
5,What is a Life?,"Sometimes when reading or thinking or, simply, being direct witness to the casual cruelty that God is so evidently fond of, we feel a small bubble become loosened in the vicinity of our inner soul and, rising and expanding, it reaches surface and our faces spontaneously contract and our eyes fill with tears and we must sit quietly for a moment and, in my case, wish that we could smash that God squarely in it's hellish face. But it passes and we are again back in the normal universe where we understand that things just are. The reader of this book has more than one opportunity for such experience. The slightly elitest tone of the author does not detract but, somehow, offers some hope that we may grow up. The translation, as well as I can judge having lived only four years in Hiroshima, is superb."

5,Entertaining and Informative,Worth watching. Very entertaining and informative. Lots of good interviews and very well put together. I really enjoyed this one.
1,Waste of time,It was not what I expected and narration was boring. I could hardly stay connected and was glad when it was over.
3,Too much talk - not enough information,The topic is interesting. But information given does not justify the time spent. Lot of talk about the past. Nothing much about the future of the industry.
4,Side by Side 4 Stars,"Interviews with the best directors in the movie business about using computer graphics in the movies. How these directors used computer graphics in there blockbuster movies, very informative. I give it 4 Stars."
2,side by side,"found this to be slow, needs a quicker start up to keep your interest. did not really care for it...I love keanu though which is why I was interested in the first place"
2,No substitute for the 2 oz mixing cup,"As a professional bartender, i buy lots of different things to try at the bar. O love the old OXO 2 oz mixing cups with the slanted measuring lines. I thought i'd try this as well. It's not very useful, hard to read when you are moving fast, and really just doesn't bring anythign new to the table. I wish OXO would just keep making the other ones."
1,didn't work on cat pee,"I have a cat who has decided to mark the world (i.e., my house) as his. All the furniture has been soaked, and I've already put zippers in the couch cushions and replaced the stuffing with pillows to make then easy to wash. I picked this up on impulse at Petsmart, along with a gallon of refill. I was excited because the package said you can use it in the laundry. Unfortunately, it not only doesn't remove cat pee smell, but leaves a nasty smell of it's own when it dries. I haven't noticed much difference in laundry, but this weekend he's been on a tear: walls, cushions, blankets. I've squirted almost the entire bottle on stuff to no avail. That's why I'm here on Amazon looking for something else. Once this dries, the smell comes back. Maybe it works better on barf or something, but not cat pee!"
1,Rotten eggs not in ingredients? Oh my...,"While I can't vouch if this product actually removes odors as it advertises, I can guarantee that it's one of the worst smelling ""odor destroyer"" products out there. I sprayed one mist and my wife and I were gagging. If you have a strong stomach and don't mind the smell of terrible rotten eggs, than this product is great for you. I, on the other hand, could not stand the smell of this product for even a second! There is no way I could spray this on my carpet let alone let it near my nostrils. Of course this spray is going to cover your pets odors! It could cover the stench of a garbage dump with its powerful chemical aroma."
2,Not so good,"I generally buy Natures Miracle at PETsMART and it works great. This item however leaves an odor and does not do a great job at removing pet urine. It will work a bit, but I would recommend other products."
5,Lifted stains and made carpet new again!,"My cat throws up food once in a while when she eats too fast. I bought this product randomly just because I wanted free shipping. I never really believe into the whole ""oxy"" hype but I am convinced after using this! I sprayed it on her vomit (the vomit was there for at least 1 or 2 days), came back to clean after 10 minutes and to my surprise when I saw that the solution had ""lifted"" the vomit off the carpet. It scrubbed off so easily and it looked like nothing was ever there!The only thing I would warn you about is to wear gloves when using this and old clothes. I'm not too familiar with the chemicals listed but it did burn a small hole on my kackis"
1,absolutely horrible!!!!!!!!!,I too was excited after reading all the positive reviews about this product. I was so disappointed after I used it and it did NOTHING AT ALL!
5,the best book ever,i think this book is the best. i have this one with Dont Get Caught In The Teachers Lounge. both are womderful!!!!!!!!!
4,Funny!,"The Book ""Don't Get Caught Wearing the Lunch Ladys Hairnet"" is one of the funniest books I've ever read. Wilson Dusty & Kyle are at in it again in this book, breaking the school rules & trying to get away from the lunch monitors. Definetly one of Todd's best"
1,Disapointment...,"Sorry guys... but quite a disapointing movie... many things in common with ""Ghost Ship"", which is not a good movie either. A lot of ""maritime"" inaccuracies... and nothing original really! The only good thing about the movie are the excelent shots of the ""Queen Mary"", but other than that nothing special.If you like well filmed mystery movies about the ""Triangle"", I do not recommend this one. Especially if you are in to ""maritime"" movies... steer clear!"
3,Fafi,This book was not well organized and had very little finished artwork.I love fafi but she needs to get more finished worked collected and then I would consider buying something from her again.
5,Instrumental fiddle music as good as it gets.,"This is an excellent collection of great Irish classics.It is totally instrumental,so don't expect any ballads or rebel songs.Although there are 26 listings ,there are in fact many more tunes,since there are several different tunes under the same listing.Many of the tunes are very familiar ones,but just as many are less well known.It is simply a large collection ,without any break or announcements ; when one tune finishes and another begins;they just follow one after the other.There is no information given as to who the musicians are on each tune.I suspect the same are on each one;but I really don't know.It is an excellent collection that you'll just want to ""put on"" and sit back and enjoy,as background music,where every once in a while,you'll recognize a familiar tune."
1,Ideal Sweetener Packets,"To me, this company was in a rush to market and did very little, or no, testing nor did they seem to conduct any quality control. To spite being stored in an air-tight container, this sweetener is always ""stuck to the sides of the packet"" and will not flow into the coffee mug or other goblet. To get to the goods, one will have to tear open the paper sachet. Because of the in-ability of the envelope's contents to easily flow, they are worthless and I would not recommend it to anyone."
4,Great Little Purse,"This is a great little purse to carry only my essentials: wallet, keys, cell phone and glasses. Keeps me from filling my bag with too much junk. I've received lots of positive comments on it."
5,Real Prada,"I have owned a lot of Prada bags... and ordered a few online that were not real, so I had to send them back. This is the real thing, thankfully. It's big enough for keys, a cell phone, and a few other items. Definitely a great fun bag."
2,There are better books on the topic,"Really between 2.5 and 3 stars. I struggled a bit with this book, as the writing style did not seem to flow as easily for me as some other accounts of the Convention did. I did like the succinct delegates summary at the end of the book. And including the Articles along with the Constitution was nice.I don't really hold anything against this book, but I prefer others, such as the books by Drinker Bowen, Peters and Stewart"
4,The US Constitution,"It turned out, indeed, to be ""A Brilliant Solution,"" but the process of fashioning our Constitution seemed less brilliant than plodding, cumbersome, and bogged down by parochial fears and suspicions. Nevertheless, it worked! And although it included elements we needed to eliminate or alter over the years (and some we'd still like to change!), it's still a wondrous document! Dan Fischel"
3,"Interesting, though lacking a bit","The most interesting parts of this book are the personal descriptions of the men who drafted the Constitution and the comments on the mood of the country at the time. The author makes an interesting observation: The American Revolution was not one revolution; rather, it was 13 revolutions, one for each of the colonies. However, post-1776 it became clear that a stronger form of Federal government was required. This book does a good job describing the varying opinions of state vs. federal responsibilities, as viewed by the founding fathers.It's a relatively short book, though some of the descriptions drag a bit. And I would have liked to see a description of how the Bill of Rights came to be. Perhaps that was not part of the original Constitution, but it was added shortly thereafter and seems to be an integral part of this important document."
2,A Brilliant Solution,"The book was in great condition when i received it, and it came very promptly so i had time to read it before school started, but i did not like the book. it was assigned reading after all and i did not want to do it."
2,Not recommended,"Decent book as a popular history but for anyone who wishes to go further...Berkin cites absolutely no sources in the text! She could be making this stuff up for all we know. There is a 3 page ""Note on Sources"" towards the end of the book but it is just a short bibliography, not a list of citations. Not recommended."
4,Well-written Account of the Constitutional Process,"I enjoyed reading this well-written book, which gives information about the process that resulted in the Constitution of the United States, and about the delegates to the Constitutional Convention who participated."
4,Cute and Comfortable,I love these shoes!!! They are very comfortable true to size and stylish one of my favorites!!!
5,GREAT PRODUCT,This product works very well. I live and Texas and I haven't sweat while using this product. I will continue using it.
5,Only product that works!,"I've been using this for 5 days now and it's been working better than anything I've tried before plus it doesn't burn or itch like Maxim or Certain Dri!! In the shower in the morning I scrib my pits using a wash cloth and Suave Daily Cleansing shampoo, then I use a Clearasil pad. I let that dry, then use a 5 day pad, let that dry. Then use Tom's Apricot scented deodorant. I was amazed the first night I used this and woke up in the morning with no wetness and no smell! That hasn't happened to me in over 15 years! I did sweat a bit yesterday and had just a tiny amount of smell but overall this stuff is amazing. Hopefully my local drugstore will keep on carrying it. I would order it if I had to."
2,"2 millimeters too big, also, plastic tip broke off after 6 days","This cigarette tube was a nice one, but I had to wrap my cigarettes in a small slip of paper for them to stay in, and the tip broke off with NO means of repairing it myself."
3,Looks kinda like a toy,"We bought two of these as Christmas presents. The packaging is absurd and we had to throw it away, it looked like the wrappings for those cheap little toys you would find in a dollar store. The cigarette holder is okay (as long as you put it in a nice box if it's a gift.)"
2,Not too dureable after a little play time,very undecided about this toy. I think it was a good bet initially but my son lost interest in it after very little playtime.. like 1-2 months. Not too easy to put together and not too easy to stay together!
4,"Flimsy plastc, but overall it works well!","These take some trickery to install, but once they're on they aren't going anywhere. The corners on some of mine have folded a little because the plastic is rather flimsy. My only real complaint is that there needs to be some way to keep the spout in the UP position. Even a gentle breeze will not allow them to stay up, as they'll blow right down again due to their light weight. My solution was to use small bungee cords and wrap them around the downspout so I can mow around them. Other than that, they work exactly as designed, so since that's what I bought them for, they get 4 stars."
1,Pathetic!,"This product did nothing at all to stop the leakage around two sky lights for our storage shed. Obviously, what I always thought about infomercials is completely true. Just words and false presentation of an obvious useless product!!"
5,One of the best Rave/Techno compilations of the early 90's,"XL Recordings had a lot of great artists, the early 90's was the explosion of rave/techno and this compilation (and its series) is one of the best ever released. Filled with only the most kickin and full length versions of each of the tracks, it is truely a Hardcore, you know the Score release."
2,Poor technical assistance for product,"We have been unable to obtain adequate and expedient technical assistance for this product so that the cards print at an acceptable speed. We are limited to email assistance, which has so far referred us to another email address."
5,A DELIGHTFUL SOFTWARE PRODUCT,I bought this after a recommendation from a friend and wasn't disappointed. My 5-year-old grandson loves it and plays with it frequently. It's a great learning experience for him in addition to being a lot of fun. There's a cute story which he can read (or have read to him by the computer) and lots of objects to click on to reveal funny objects behind them. A real winner!
5,"Tough dog, Tuff Balls","Our dog can destroy any toy (except Kongs) so it is normally just a matter of time before they are shredded. These Tuff Balls are no differert in the sense that she can destroy them if left alone with them. BUT they do last longer than anything else we've had so that's a good thing. I was very happy with the price to quality to quantity of these balls. I've bought two sets of them already. She loves them. Just FYI though, they are a bit harder then a tennis ball so if you are expecting that squishy tennis ball feel, these are not for you. I still bounce them off the wall though, so they are not ""hard"" but they are a lot more firm then a regular tennis ball."
2,Tuff? I think not!,"Hello people. My name is Ivan and I am a eight year old german shepard. For christmas my humans gave me three tuff balls in my stocking. Once I opened this, I was so happy to find a tennis ball I could not pop, for they are industrial strength! It took me fifteen minutes at most to break the big ball. Give me ten more and I bet I will break the two little ones. I suggest for atleast other german shepards, do not get your hopes up and buy these balls, for I am now having a sad christmas. :("
2,NOT TOUGH,I bought these because my one dog loves to play with balls and my other dog loves to eat balls. I was hoping that these would stand up to the chewing and stay in one piece so that I could play with my other dog. THESE BALLS LAST ABOUT 30 SECONDS LONGER THAN REGULAR TENNIS BALLS. I was very disappointed.
2,"This book isn't scary, its silly","Okay, the first few chapters had a creepie feel maybe but this novel lands with a big thud halfway through. The so-called suspense attempts to build up throughout 3/4 worth of the book only to reveal a dissapointing ending that didn't have any chills whatsoever. I don't understand the high ratings this book has recieved. If you want a better ""cold weather"" horror novel to read, try After Sundown by Randall Boyll."
5,AWESOME!,"This wisk is exactly what I needed. I whip up my hot cocoa, cappuccino and shakes, in a cup and only have to clean one item instead of two. It works very good."
3,it served its purpose,product was delivered as promised and in new condition. it served its purpose in installing my daughters stereo in her car.
5,Works great,"This product does exactly what it's supposed to do. I used it to install a new head unit in my 97 Accord and it worked perfectly. The wires are good quality and have a decent amount of length so they're easy to solder up. The packaging has a table that tells you which color wire has what function, but the wires themselves are also marked with their function so even if you lose the packaging you're still fine. This is a nice bonus - I guess if I decide to replace my head unit down the road I could reuse this harness without guessing."
1,Complaint,"I blame the person who wrote the product description, i have the same model car and it didn't match up like i expected.It made me do double the work by making me disasemble the dash board the first time with no completion. So i ended up buying two wiring harnesses, not jus one."
4,Great if you dont mind connecting a ton of wires,This product was great but I would look for a different type of connector. One that goes from a Honda/Acura 86-98 to the specific type of stereo you have it saves a ton of work and is normally cheaper.
5,Works great and is super easy to use,So simple and so much better than cutting up your factory harness. The colors even matched up on the install and it was basic.
1,never recived my product.,its a week after it says i should hve gooten my products and nothing is here. i am not sure who has it but its not me so i am a little upset. well i take that back i very upset. :((
1,go with fleece,"I bought a TON of these for my baby girl. Not knowing what in the heck to get for cloth diapers. They worked OK for the first couple of months. But when she started sleeping more through the night she began getting rashes. She would be sitting in a soaking, sopping wet diaper for hours. The only alternative was to change her multiple times at night. This created a sleepless night for me, as every time I changed her she would fully wake up and need to be rocked, lulled, walked and cradled back to sleep, sometimes taking over an hour.I finally switched to Pocket diapers with fleece lining and they worked MUCH better. A bigger initial investment but worth it in the long run."
2,Thick but too narrow,"These prefolds are nice and thick, but they're too long and not wide enough. These have never fit around my baby, but I do use them folded in a cover. My baby was a little larger than average when born (8lbs, 3oz), but they definitely should have fit around her stomach. If you're looking for a diaper to fold and set in a cover, this one is fine, but if you want a diaper that you can pin or close with a snappi, I suggest another company."
4,fine,"these diapers are just fine. nothing great, nothing bad. For the price, they are a good option and work as well as any of the other more expensive kind.The only draw back I have is that they took over a week to ship. This was still within the expected delivery time but other diapers I ordered at the same time came within two days."
2,Great burp rag,"After washing these according to the instructions they do become billowy and soft. However I tried these once or twice and didn't like that the pee stays close to her skin in the cotton. I saw the beginnings of a rash so I switched to an AIO but since I had so many of these I looked for other ways to use them. They're the perfect size for burp rags. I always have 2 or 3 in my diaper bag, 2 on the arm rest of our couch for spills but even with those jobs after you're done cleaning it up you have to get a new one out. It takes a while for the fluids to absorb into the cloth (which is probably why I switched to another kind of diaper). I still like them but not as diapers."
3,not bad,"this coloring book is not bad. i would say it's geared more for an adult or a more serious art student. the layout is fine and i do like many of the designs, but would have to say it's a bit overpriced for what i think you get."
5,Helps my Dad,"My elderly Dad occasionally suffers from mild edema which presents as swelling in his ankles. A couple of days of Kidney Care always seems to help clear it up. He, of course, receives regular medical attention but this product seems to help with minor issues."
3,hammock,"The hammock is not as big as pictured, it's actually much smaller, I would say two very short people could fit like the people shown. It's made very durable but only not very large so only one person can use it and they have to use it sideways."
1,They lie!,"It took me forever to get my hammock set up because the hammock stand I have was too low for it because it sags so much. After altering my stand to get it to work, it rained for a week. I finally got on it today for the first time, and it broke within 10 minutes. The cords started snapping one by one and I fell to the ground. I was on it alone, and do not weigh anywhere near the 500 lbs. limit. What a waste, and now they say it is too late to send it back. Jipped!"
1,don't bother,"Bought it from and returned it to Gander MTN. Put it up and hit the ground. Very, very saggy, wide open spaces. I wish I had taken a bit more care of the one I had--over 30 years old and passed to my husband and I from his parents. Unfortunately, left it up too late into the winter and an animal got ahold of it."
1,Lasted less than two years!,"Was relaxing on the hammock today and it just gave way dropping me down on the floor (which is what prompted me to write this review immediately). On close inspection the ropes were all frayed, especially near the wooden bars. This hammock lasted less than two years but then again you get what you pay for I guess. I just didn't like getting thrown to the ground unexpectedly.But while it lasted it was very comfortable. A little difficult to get onto especially for two people but once you are on it is quite relaxing. So if you prefer to try out a different hammock every year or so then you can certainly go for this hammock. If you are looking for something that will last a few years you are better off looking elsewhere."
1,Very poor quality,"This hammock was priced great but the quality proved to be terrible. Upon first inspection and use, it seemed to be sturdy, but in 4 months time it was completely shredded. The ropes tore in numerous places making it impossible to use. I am not exagerating when I say it tore in at least 30 places. This was not from use, simply from being outdoors. It seems when it got wet, it tore like wet paper, even with no weight on it. There was never more than 150 pounds in the hammock at once.I suppose this might be a good product if it is kept under a roof, but do not buy it if you plan to hang it outdoors or even under a tree. It was a complete waste of money!"
2,2 person hammock - hah,"I received this hammock as a gift and it's going back.1. I already had a hammock stand and when I attached this to the stand (extending our chains to the very end it looks like its for children. Seems rather short.2. Box says up to 500 pounds, open up the packaging and roll out the hammock and the little piece of paper packed with it says maximum weight 350 pounds.3. It sags - I had it streched so I almost needed a step stool to sit on it it was so high on our large hammock stand, then sat it in and just barely cleared the concrete patio. Can't imagine what would happen if I layed in it for 30 minutes.The only good thing is it wasn't that expensive and it would be okay for 2 kids."
1,"""Welcome to the Ice House"" by Jane Yolen","Owning wonderful ""Alphabeastiary"" and ""Owl Moon"" by Yolen mistakenly led us to this book. Text is barely verbal and vacant, certainly not any great addition to our science collection, as Booklist review tends to indicate. Splitting a sentence between four pages is not our idea of reading. Any parents who are reading for literary enhancement should find something else. The star we give is for illustrations, nothing more. The illustrator should have put as much effort into the interior as she did the cover. Too bad, overall disappointment."
1,Very disappointed,I received my order yesterday and am very disappointed in the way it looked. It is so fake looking. I did not even receive an invoice to return it. I ordered 4 plants and they were all terrible. Will not order anything else.
4,Is This Book As Good As It Seems,"Very different in style from almost anything you have read before. At times it's difficult to determine who the book is about and who the ""narrator"", who keeps putting in long notes, actually is (or R-G wants you to think he is). The great thing about the story is that it keeps repeating but always changing. It like an illusion, viewed through a dirty window. Each layer of dirt you remove gives you a new perspective.Read it and decide for yourself whether it is a great belle-lettre or just the musing of an old master."
5,PHAT,"Finally, a hardcore Christian hip-hop artist who knows how to express Salvation in another level. True Hip hop at it's orignal purpose. This CD a must add to the collection."
3,Tough glove but not as tough as indicated,"This glove is pretty tough and it provides for fairly sensitive touch. However, even a small rose thorn will puncture the nitrile palm portion of the glove. It is good for handling rough boards and doing some construction. I do like the fairly tight fit and associated touch sensitivity. If you're handling something fragile you can really feel how much pressure you're putting on the item."
4,Good Value,"I love this MP3 Player. I recently bought a red iRiver H10 20GB MP3 Player/Recorder because the RCA Lyra that I had stopped working on me. I bought this one refurbished because it was cheaper, but I don't have any major problems with it. It holds a lot of songs and I love the radio and recorder feautures. The only big problem is you CAN'T skip to the next song. You either have to keep fast forwarding, or go back a screen and actually click on the next song. This is especially annoying if you have it on shuffle mode and want to quickly get through your songs. A minor problem is the size. I know this isn't the newest model, and it is pretty bulky. It isn't really pocket size, so I'm constantly using the belt clip. If you have a lot of songs and only need a couple of basic functions, this iRiver H10 is perfect for you."
3,H10 iRiver,Problem with this unit is it would not hold a charge. You have to keep it docked which I found very inconvenient. I purchased the Creative zen in place of it and love it!
2,"Great, but crashes alot, support non existant","Bought this for the wife at christmas, loaded up around 1k songs quick enough, but some songs would suddenly just not play, eventually you wouldnt be able to play any and i would have to ""recover"" the drive (i.e. wipe it and re-sync the music). This happens like every week now.Have emailed to IRIVER 3 times now over 10 day period. No reply. They provide no telephone number that i can find.Going to try and return it to Amazon now, at least they give good customer service.It may well be that i just have a bad drive, but Iriver dont seem to care about it."
2,"Didn't Keep this iRiver, but Plan on Buying iRiver Clix","I'd read a great review rating this as a Best Buy and a very good rating. Set up was easy and I had my brother in law help with loading tunes. But the H10 kept freezing. Could only load a few songs and the system froze. And I couldn't shut it off, only with a toothpick on the reset button. It was very frustrating. So I returned it to the company and sent a letter asking either for an exchange, refund or instructions on how to fix. I received a very prompt refund for the full amount. I have an iRiver Clix 2GB on order now. My sister and brother-in-law both have several and highly recommended that I don't give up on iRiver and get another. So I will as I trust their judgement and CR."
1,Plays 4 Sure?,"Just be warned that this and any device that is branded with the PlaysforSure stuff is bound to Microsoft 4ever. If you ever decide to use an Apple or any other operating system Microsoft has decided not to allow this device to function anymore thereby forcing you to use their products.While there's nothing wrong with using products ""designed"" for Microsoft Windows just be aware that playsforsure means plays forsure in Windows only, and even then if Microsoft updates Windows will it still work?Be careful before spending your money!"
2,"There's good and bad, mine was bad.","I have had this Iriver 20GB for 1 week, in that time I have run with it 4 times. Out of the 4 times it locked up 3 times after playing about 3-4 songs. I heard good and bad about this player but I'm a benefit of the doubt kind of guy. Unfortunately mine was bad. What sold me was the size 20 GB WOW. Well I know better now. Usb dongle is inconvenient and the pictures don't look that great. The player itself looks pretty slick, and the radio seems to work well. I recommend that if you just want to listen to music or exercise this may not be what you want. The novelty of having my whole collection with me is what got me. But if you're like me there's only several artists that I can tolerate to listen to all the time so rotating files does not seem to bad to me NOW. Last thing, They should include a paperclip in the box as often as you have to reset the unit."
4,IRiver H10-20 Product Review,I purchased this unit for my daughter for her birthday. So far she is very happy with the unit. It appears to be excellent quality and a wonderful sound.
1,Bad design,Only works with Windows media player for transfersNot easy to workBad sound (IAudio is better)
3,Not very good first impression,"I just bought my iRiver H10 20GB red last week, and received it yesterday. The very first disappointment is1. It does not look as good as it looks in pictures2. slightly bigger than expected3. The very bad thing is it has a rubber case, which does not even fit properly. After pushing-pulling from here there, i could put it on H10, and it is just like potato in a polythene bag. Looks really ugly.Now i am looking for a decent case for my h10 20gb, and i can't find it in this big world. I wish i would have made a decision to buy a ipod instead of this crappy iRiver, my bad.Sound quality is good, but first impression is very bad."
4,"Fine for music, not audiobooks","The iRiver series has some great advantages for music. It offers gapless playback, avoiding two-second pauses when listening to a complete album (which can ruin continguous transitions on albums such as Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon). And many reviews suggest it offers higher fidelity for complex sound.One downside: This is one of the only players not supported (at least explicitly) by audible.com, favored as having the largest library of downloadable audiobooks/ebooks. There are some ways around that, such as third-party software that requires being a bit more tech savvy than you might be. But if audiobooks are your thing, an alternative (such as the Creative Zen line, or the industry-leading iPod) may be preferable."
4,TERRIFIC!,"Awesome MP3 player, only compaints are battery life and speed. The player is slow to load songs (i have 20 GB version with 11 GB used so far). The sound is rich, has great features, blah blah blahI use it with Napster-to-Go. Works fine. Just make sure you take advantage of the firmware upgrades, and as long you take care of it, it will take care of you."
4,Reliable and easy to use,"I purchased this player after returning a Sony Network Walkman due to the limitations of the software - you're only able to utilise the software on the first PC you install it to which is ... frustrating.The iriver H10 is very easy to navigate and doesn't require the use of a proprietry platform (such as iTunes or Sonic Stage). Being able to do everything through Windows Media Player is just so much easier. The sound quality is really very good (Sony probably just a little better in this regard) and battery life is great. (I dig my red case too.)Unlike some other reviewers, I have had very positive customer service experiences including a phone call within 12 hours of emailing iriver Australia with a query about the USB. I understand US customers haven't had such great support, however.Overall, I'm extremely happy with my purchase and glad I decided to go with 20GB. 6GB just doesn't go a long way - at all - if you want to move your music collection onto your player."
3,ok at first,"I first bought this mp3 player because it was cheaper than an ipod for the same size capacity.After 2yrs. it may be time to buy a new mp3 player. The iriver will no longer sync up to add new songs, locks up very often, battery life has truly lessened and I cant scroll past a certain point on my music list. I dont think i would buy another iriver because of the problems that I have encountered and also I have friends that have ipods and have not had any such problem as I have.At the time I thought it was a good deal,but having to spend another 200 plus for a new mp3 kinda sux and my friends are still on thier 1st ipod. Good luck with your purchases."
3,Pleasant enough,"Of all the Celaeno books I've read so far it's left the least positive impression.I'm not sure whether it was the order I read it in, it's a pretty much direct prequel to Temple at Landfall, and having read that, I knew how it was going to end. That in itself is not necessarily a problem if it's filled with enough meat besides the obvious parts of the stories and here I just didn't feel there was. Heavy on romance, a murder mystery and information about the Ranger characters from Landfall, the only thing I felt added to my knowledge of Celaeno was the in depth look at life at the Rangers, and that was good and interesting.Not a bad read by far, I just didn't connect with it as much as with the others."
3,Not the Best and Not the Worst,"A helpful book for first-time writers. Gives the basics, but not the best book currently out on the subject."
1,READER BEWARE,"Beware of Theses and Dissertations Press, which is just a cover for Holocaust negationists. Germar Rudolf is a notorious example. A 42-year-old German neo-Nazi who claims the Holocaust never happened was jailed for 30 months by a court in the south-western city of Mannheim in March 2007. At the start of his trial in November, Germar Rudolf had called the Holocaust 'a gigantic fraud.' He was last year expelled from the United States to Germany, which charged him with incitement to racial hatred. A chemist, Rudolf has published pseudo-scientific claims that it was impossible that Zyklon-B poison was used in the gas chambers at the Nazis' Auschwitz death camp. Denial of the Holocaust is punishable in Germany with up to five years in jail. Last month, another US-based German neo-Nazi, Ernst Zuendel, was sentenced to five years in jail for his books and websites which contained fulsome praise of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler and abuse towards Jews.[...]."
1,Breaking the Law in Germany,"It will interest some that taking the advice of one of the reviewers and putting this book in your luggage when you go to Germany will get you arrested. It is illegal to deny the Holocaust in Germany, where thousands of Germans are still dealing with the guilt of being part of this horror. Showing this book to people will not be concidered ""free speach""- Germanny denies itself any right to water-down what happened.And while you're at it, try check out primary sources for the evidence of the Holocaust - ""The Commandant of Auwschwits,"" a autobiography, is a good place to start."
1,"Worthless, basic old anti-Semitism","Dissecting the Holocaust is just a new spin on anti-Semitism.What's next, denying slavery in America, denying the Red Sox won the series in 2004.Some call this a scholarly work, it is not scholarly, rather phony intellectualism, which is a pure lie."
5,Keeps paint off the wood floors!!,My son received theMelissa & Doug Deluxe Standing Easelfor Christmas but I did not want to open it until we had a drop cloth. Our whole house is wood floors so I needed something to protect them. This drop cloth works perfectly!! It's big enough to fit under the easel and then some but it's not so huge that it's an eyesore. Paint wipes off the drop cloth very easily and it is very durable when walked on or things are dropped on it. Very happy with this product!!
2,Flimsy,"Not worth the money; poor quality, too lightweight. I thought it would be a lot nicer because I like the company."
3,Durable but sticky,"My daughter loves art projects so I order this drop cloth to protect the carpet from paint and marker stains. It does what it's supposed to do. There are no spills that seep through the plastic and it has held up well. However, since it is plastic, when folded, it kind of sticks together a bit (even when clean and dry), and if she's not wearing shoes/socks, her feet stick a bit as she walks over it.For a toddler, the size seems right though I wouldn't use it for more than one child at a time. It's not big enough for collaborative art projects. I'm not a fan of the appearance since it's busy and that distracts from any art projects, but that's just my opinion as the adult not my daughter's opinion as the primary person actually using the drop cloth. Overall, it's a good value for the price and quality though I've been considering putting a canvas paint cloth over it for less stick when we're painting barefoot in the summer."
5,Great for Young Artists!,These are great for use with arts and crafts kits and kids who have a tendency to be a little messy. Works really well withMelissa & Doug Deluxe Standing Easel.
4,good multi purpose drop cloth,"I bought 2 of these - one for under my daughter's art easel and one for under her kid size table & chair set. They work great. At the table she has dropped playdough, food, spilled drinks, and dripped bubbles on it. The drop cloth does a great job saving our carpet!"
5,Alexia's Drop Cloth,"My Grand-daughter Alexia says this drop cloth was just what she needed to save her mom from clean up after her hours of drawing, etc."
3,Alex Toy Drop Cloth 36x48,"The quality of the drop cloth is great. My Grandaugher loved the bright colors. The only way to improve on the useability of this product would be to make it larger. The 36x48 size DOES NOT cover the ""danger zone"" when a young child paints. If lager this would be a 5 STAR!"
5,Easel's Companion,"We purchased this drop cloth to accompany the Melissa and Doug art easel. It catches the paint splaters and provides a designated space for our budding artist. My daughter is only two, so this is a necessary accessory."
2,Kind of small...,Bought this to go under my daughter's new Melissa and Doug Easel. It's way smaller than I thought it'd be. Seems kind of useless... I probably could have just put a couple of garbage bags under the easel and it would have worked just as well.
4,Great product,"serves it's purpose. Very happy with drop cloth. Our child uses it for projects, play dough, etc. easy to pick up and clean up, better then on the floor. Very satisfied."
3,"Okay, but....","This is a great concept, and they are very hard to find, but it's not quite big enough. It's pretty durable, but will rip if you catch it on a chair or table. I just wish it was double the size! We use them for play-doh and other crafts, and inevitably stuff ends up all over the floor anyway. As for painting, by the time you put it under an easel, there is no slack on the sides for the paint which splatters off the side. I guess you could buy two and tape them together, but then it's not cost effective. Use a tarp instead."
3,Great size drop cloth,We bought this for our 4yo to use with her Melissa and Doug Deluxe Standing Easel. It fits great under it and catches any mess that might occur.
3,Drop Cloth,"This drop cloth is a present for my son. He is getting an easel for Christmas and I got this to go under it. It has not been opened yet but it appears to be just as I expected. It also arrived on time, when I expected it to."
1,SMELL !!!,This drop clothe has one of the worst toxic smell.I am surprise that so much people give it to their kids without thinking of the chemical smell.Returned just after I open the package.
1,ITEM IS NOT A BOOK!!! This is a PC program.,"PC game was very disappointing. Activities were limited (6) and did not increase in difficulty at the child progresses. The stories were nice, but were too few. This could have been a great product but creators fell short. Very disappointed."
5,Wonderful resource for all ages,"This Bible was a tremendous hit with our school's young people. They would carry it around and read whenever they could. Some parents came back to purchase another one for a sibling. The religion teacher highly recommended it and with good reason. It has no specific ""agenda"" except to put the biblical stories into easier bites for the readers and has attractive illustrations to accompany each story. Adults have said it has been of value to them also in their study and use with their families."
1,upset,"was very upset with this buy. it did not look like the picture, had a totally differnet cover. I wanted the one that was shown in the picture specifically for a reason."
3,Of Beetles & Angels,"Of Beetles & AngelsI think the book, Of Beetles & Angels is a good book for reading, and so I recommend it for teachers that teach reading, and read it to students, because students from other regions can learn that people that are not from America can go far in their studies and have a successful life.This book is about a family that lived well in Ethiopia, but then the father had some problems, and they moved to America. America wasn't like Ethiopia; they had a little trouble when they got here, but with time life treats them better. Selamawi the main character get support from his parents to learn. Selamawi learns English and studies very hard and because of that he goes to study at Harvard.I'm Hispanic I'm from Baja California, Mexico I go to Roosevelt High School and I read this book in my English class."
4,From a Refugee to a Harvard grad,"Selamawi ""Mawi"" Asgedom tells of his journey from an Ethipoian/Eritrean refugee to a harvard graduate in his poignant memoir, Of Beetles and Angels. Driven by his family's tireless encouragement, this miracle man faced the challenges of leaving a culture, a homeland, and a way of life behind. Finding angels in the most unlikely places, Mawi reteaches the reader the golden rule through his and his family's acceptance of others, and genuine willingness to help those in need.I was moved by the recounting of the Asgedoms' trials and triumphs.This is truly an example of what family should mean; encouraging one another, pushing each other to do their best, and most strikingly, the cohesion that American families sometimes lack. Reading more like a collection of short stories than a work of non-fiction, Of Beetles and Angels captures the reader's attention, emotions, and heart throughout.Reviewed by CandaceK"
5,Read this book,"this is a beautiful book. mawi's courage,integrity and perserverance inspired me. i encourage everyone to read this book and be moved by this story."
2,Poor writing,"This book seems to be required reading at most inner city schools. It's a typical poor boy from a third world country makes it big story. Sound familiar? It's a shame the poor writing takes away from the story though. I agree that most childen should be taught never to give up on dreams, but there are much better written books out there."
4,Helping children learn about bullying,"""Betty Stops the Bully"" deals with ways people bully other people and what you can do about it. It also provides some insight for the child to determine if they are engaged in bullying or teasing someone else as well as a No More Bullies Pledge. The writing style provides many opportunities to openly discuss the subject with your child. This is one of the Emotional Literacy Series and can be purchased as part of a three books set on dealing with Bullying, Anger, and Fear."
1,Horrible!!!,This book is horrible. I am an elementary school counselor and I tried to read this book to the kids. They were bored and I was even more bored. There is nothing in it that makes it fun or engaging for students. I didn't even finish the book. I closed it and told them we would just talk about bullying instead.
2,cool features BAD PHONE,"I loved the features for this phone, I mean how fun ringtones, faceplates, flashing antena's. Its a cell phone lovers dream. But unfortuantely like a cell phone it isn't a clear call maker. It makes a popping , yes I read the reviews before purchasing and I thought it was just their faulty phone, I was wrong. Were not just talking one popping noise it happens through the whole time you are on the phone about every 10-15 sec. It sounds like someone keeps pressing flash and swithching lines. It got so frustrating that I finally gave up my cool features and went for a phone that just worked. I guess we will have to wait for them to work out the quirks and try again in a year."
2,Gave it 2 chances......,"I bought the gz2456 phone because my sister and brother in law have a Vtech phone that they said they were happy with. Unfortunately, the handset couldn't connect to the base after charging. I returned it for another gz2456, and the second one worked, but within a week, the sound quality went downhill. There was a lot of static, and sometimes the sound would go out altogether for a second or two. I also tried to upload midi files for ringtones with the included software, but perfectly good sounding midi songs sounded terrible and extremely choppy once they were transferred to the phone. I decided to take the second one back and get a completely different phone. The static may have been interference with my wireless LAN, but the phone just wasn't very good overall anyway."
2,Unreliable and obnoxious phone,"This phone worked fine, for awhile. But after shortly over a year, the battery barely holds a charge. The phone dies after a very short time (I can only assume this has something to do with the complex ringtones, and the fact that the volume must be turned up all the way if we are to hear the phone ringing from across the house.) Unfortunately, we are stuck listening to the Rocky theme when our phone rings, because the ""normal"" ringing phone sounds this thing produces are shrill and obnoxious. My stepdaughter may like the Christina Aguilera songs the phone plays, but my husband and I are less than thrilled with the ring selections. I cannot recommend this phone, at least not for an adult's use."
1,What a Phone,"I bought this phone from staples and its like free after mail in rebate. Everything works fine, ring tone is great... lights on phone is nice and cool when it rings. But....... the phone dont ring if it's on a cradle for charging. What a waste ... who the hell in this world can make a phone like this which doesnt ring when its charging on a cradle."
4,"The ""greenest"" shampoo we could find","We found this wonderful shampoo via the Skin Deep database - its ingredients have lower toxicity than many common liquid brands. We came to appreciate the bar for the fact that it is light to ship as it contains no water. This improves its ""embodied energy"" (represents what it takes to bring the product to the consumer). It smells wonderful when used and leaves only a very light natural scent in our hair. We give it one less than perfect stars because it tends to leave residue in our slow-to-drain shower, but the clean up is easy."
2,Bad first impression,"I have never used a shampoo bar before and was excited to try it! I have thick dark hair just past my shoulders. I have only been using this product for a week, but it seems to leave a funny greasy-ish texture to my hair. I normally have very dry scalp and hair, so I was very surprised! I'm definitely rinsing it out very well, so I wonder if it's stripping the natural oils and forcing my scalp to over-produce to compensate? Or maybe it's not mixing well with my conditioner? Any ideas?"
3,after 2 years it failed,"after 2 years of owning this tv, i went on holiday for a few days. i turned off everything. on my return i switched the tv on and it wouldnt stay on. it goes on for about 3 seconds and then turns off. kreisen's phone number is disconnected, im still waiting for the email reply. i paid a lot of money for this tv and i feel it should have lasted a bit longer like another 5 years. another item to mention, when i used it for the comp as a monitor , the icons leave a shadow on the screen. i would stay away from this tv."
3,"Good microphone, No cable","Especially for the price, this seems like a very good microphone. The sound quality seemed excellent for voice and piano and it has a lot of weight to it and seems durable.However, not having bought studio microphones before, it was a surprise that it did not include a cable--which costs more than the microphone itself. I paid $20 for the microphone and $25 for the cable at radio shack. The item description should include the name of the 3-prong-to-1/4"" jack required."
1,Product was expired and they were bad at responding,"I received expired vitamins and they were not very responsive when I emailed them asking about a refund. They kept taking days to respond and then said I needed to show them receipts, etc etc. I ended up letting them win and eating 40 bucks because I was sick of dealing with them.I will NEVER buy from them again. The whole point in buying LIVE vitamins is to have them fresh."
5,Great product,These multi vitamins are the best I've ever taken. They are the only vitamin I've taken where I (1) actually feel a difference after taking and (2) can take on an empty stomach with no discomfort. I will continue to take these vitamins.
3,It's OK but dated,"First let me start by saying I'm new to firewalls, but have been a computer systems builder for years and configuring Windows operating systems for the past 5 years. I was looking for a primer book.. The book covers fundamentals and the authors give in-depth examples for UNIX systems. About a third of the way through the book it remarked about the Windows 95 and their new NT technology (which has been around since about 2000). i finished reading the book, allot about UNIX and non existent on Microsoft products. Not a total waste of money but I finished the book feeling like i sat down for a dinner and was only served a side salad. Back to Amazon book list for me!"
5,The book on firewalls,"This is THE book on firewalls.If you want information from the authoritative sources, this is the book to get.If you can tolerate the anti-Microsoft aspect, read on!"
4,Great Performance for the price!!,"This is my first home theater system and I think the sound is great. I didn't expect the booming bass from its passive woofers. The speakers are nice looking and a cool feature about them is that you can mount them directly onto the wall without any extra parts. It's very innovative. One drawback is that you have to use the speaker wires provided. You can extend the range by adding wire but you need the provided wire to make the connection to the back of the unit. Also while operating the receiver it takes a bit of time to switch between modes, ie going from dvd to aux or from tuner to dvd, etc.Overall I am happy with this unit, it rocks the house!!"
1,"Great Sound, No DVD video","I bought two units thinking the first one was defective. They both produced the same problem. When in DVD mode, the image on my TV is on for 2 seconds, followed by black for two seconds. This loop is continuous but sound is constant. Called Samsung, and they think its a software (firmware) issue which is not compatible with my Toshiba TV. I found on a few other websites reviews from people who have the same problem. Samsung cannot fix the problem until enough people complain. I returned the system. Too Bad it looked great and sounded great."
5,A Great Read!,"I found this book to be a fascinating read. It is beautifully, poetically written, and takes you along on Gary Ferguson's journey to one of our country's most special wilderness areas. Although the story is not always a happy one, I finished the book with a sense of hope. It is a must read if you cherish the backcountry."
3,Disappointing,"I visited Yellowstone a few months ago and picked up Hawks Rest at a local bookstore. I was thoroughly awed by the beauty and majesty of the park but was disappointed by the crowds that I just couldn't get away from. I was hoping that Hawks Rest would give me insights into the ""real"" world of Yellowstone.Given these expectations, the book truly did satisfy my purposes and I was pleased. But it also turned into a political screed. Although I very much believe in Ferguson's cause of alerting the public to the abuses of the elite hunting culture in Yellowstone, I feel that he devoted too much of this book to this cause. Hawks Nest is subtitled A Season in the Remote Heart of Yellowstone. I wish this, rather than promoting a political agenda, had been the focus of the book."
3,Elk Hunting in the Remote Heart of Yellowstone,"I bought this book hoping to gain insite to the ""Real"" yellowstone wilderness. There are real tibits and treasures of this experience in this book that I thoroughly enjoyed. The major part of the book was devoted to the political rallying that goes on with the government and NPS and elk hunters. I believe that the hunting and salting issue deserve to be brought to the publics attention, but do not believe that so much of a book supposedly about a summer on Hawk's Rest should have been devoted to it.Gary Ferguson is a very engaging writer and always delivers the goods on wonderful story writing and this book it no different. I just wish he had focused more on the wildlife and wilderness experience with short interjections on guiding and elk hunting."
5,Great for what it is!,"This book is awesome. I've lived near Yellowstone all my life and worked for the NPS for the past 5 years in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.This book is not a flowery fun romp through the summer of yellowstone, its more political and thoughtful than that. Though there is some simple summer fun in there as well.Other reviews have criticized this book for being to political... don't critique a book for what you wish it was, critique it for what it is. And for what it is, its awesome.Well written and researched. Not to heavy and very interesting. I recommend to all who have an interest in the area."
4,Good adventure read with some politics thrown in,"I read this book a couple years ago during a fishing trip to the southeast arm of Yellowstone Lake. The Hawk's Rest area intrigues me because it is the headwaters of the Yellowstone River. The hiking adventures and bits about the history of the area are great to read. I wasn't expecting the opinions about outfitters and all the politics of the area, but it was interesting to learn about that side and realize how important the area is in more ways than just the wilderness. Pick it up and read it while you travel to and in the area. [...]"
3,Not bad but still predictable.,"Only my second Hunter/Mcbain book and it is obvious that he is an excellent author. Still with the foreshadowing and the titles of the sections and characterization, you pretty much knew what was going to happen. Still, an interesting and short book to read."
3,Size issues,"I wear an 8.5M in nearly everything but not these...They pinch my toes and feel narrower than they should. I love the color and I love how they look, but I'm going to have to return them and try a bigger size. I would try the wide size too if they had one. My other Bronx shoes are an 8.5M and they are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. Sadly, this is not the case with these"
5,Entertaining,This game was for my 7 year old niece. I kept her busy for hours. It was well worth the money!
2,Comic Mania,"I have read this story in its normal content and felt the story wasn't too bad. However, I guess the comic version is not quite the same. I little too hard to get used to."
4,great grill,"Just the down and dirty. This a great quality grill which I have been using frequently over the past year or so. I've been very pleased with its performance and really have nothing negative to say. Four out of five stars because you always have room for improvement. For those of you that can afford the price, it is a solid investment in a dependable grill."
4,"Haiti, A Nightmare You Can Sleep Through","This is one of the most compelling book that I ever read about Haiti. Mr. Gold is funny and objective. One could feel his love for Haiti popping out of the pages; he is not just another foreigner out to make a quick buck. Although his experiences in the book were limited to the capital, he gave a vivid account because he was in the thick of things. When I checked with family and friends on the veracity of some of Mr. Gold's claims, he seemed to have hit right on the money. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Haiti."
2,Haiti is better than what the author had writen in his book.,"First of all your ideas are not well founded since you did not live in Haiti long enough to place a judgement or an opinion.Your grounds are very weak when you see only one part of Haiti. Being like a horse on a race track, the author is only focusing on what you may consider the worst, I would like to know when writters are going to start publishing the right stuff about a third world country."
5,BUY THIS GAME!,"My kids say, ""We have played every Nancy Drew game. This is by far our favorite one. It was challenging but not frustrating. It even had spooky moments! Graphics were awesome, never ending sluthing, and excellent ending climax. Overall PERFECT game!""WE BOTH RECOMEND IT"
4,Good game!,"I bought this game as a gift for a relative's birthday. She and her little sister are captivated by it (they are 10 & 7). It may be a little too difficult for them, even in the Jr. detective mode, but they love to play when I come over to help them. They are not however video game aficionados, so perhaps that accounts for being slow to solve the mystery. Good story line, interesting rooms and clues.I would recommend it for girls age 10 only if they are very familiar with video games, if not, it may be a little frustrating or they may need quite a bit of help. Otherwise it is a great game for girls over 10."
5,Nancy Drew CD game- Message in a Haunted Mansion #4,This is a great game that will have you on the edges of your seats. Lots of times I found myself startled by the spooky sounds and clues in this game. The important clues are well hidden and hard to find at times. I enjoyed this thrilling game.
4,Spooky and Extremely Fun!,"This was the first Nancy Drew game I played. I played it with my older sister and it took us 7 days to complete it. It freaked me out several times but not enough to give me nightmares or anything (besides I wasn't THAT young at the time). It's extremely fun and it exercises a child's mind well. It also teaches them some educational things. The graphics are great, much better than the first one (Secrets Can Kill). Buy this game!"
5,Great Fun!!!,I've just recently started playing pc games and wanted to give the Nancy Drew Mysteries a try. Message in a Haunted Mansion was my first Nancy Drew game and I was immediately hooked! I wish they had these types of games when I was much younger it was so much fun and so addicting. This game is one of the earlier ones and I'm looking forward to see how the Nancy Drew Mysteries have evolved. I plan on playing them all! I think Message in a Haunted Mansion is the perfect game it buy for first time players of the Nancy Drew Mysteries!
4,Fantastic!,"Message in a Haunted Mansion was a great game! With real looking people and everyone having a motive you get hooked. With clues, and puzzles everywhere you look you will never get bored playing the game. But be careful if you get caught snooping in someone's room you will need to go to second chance. Overall this is a wonderfull game you will never want to end."
4,Freaky and Fun Game!,"This was a very fun, yet challenging game. I loved the spooky surprises along the way! The only problem was that you had to find all the lines of the poem before you could get to a certain point. Oh yes, and the puzzles were hard. Otherwise, this is great but if you really want an AWESOME Nancy Drew game, check out Treasure in the Royal Tower.GO NANCY! Please tell me if my review is helpful or not. Thank you very much. : )"
3,just ok...,"MY kids are 8, and this game just did not keep their interest. Although as an adult, I thought it looked interesting."
2,Enjoyable game but buggy software,"My daughter loves this game but I would warn parents to load it only on the child's computer. The software is very buggy and it's difficult to shut it down. I find that when my daughter finishes playing, my laptop becomes very unstable and I have to shut it down before continuing with my work."
4,Spooky,"This game is very good and it has realistic looking people, but it's really freaky. As soon as you get near the end you start seeing shadows running across the hall, and creepy noises. This game right is right for you if you like spooky things."
4,A Great Game!,Message in a Haunted Mansion was one of the best Nancy Drew games. I recommend it to people who think out of the box and come up with clever ideas. Try this one without cheating- or use only small hints. I rated this game 4 stars because the events that happened weren't as exciting as the very last one. The last one was the most exciting part of the whole game!Thank you for reading my review.
4,Nancy Drew Fan,"This game is very exciting, but not exactly easy. For instance, you have to know your piano keys. ( I don't so i had my sister help me with that!) Some things are confusing, but I just wait an hour then come back, then some things stand out that didn't before. It certainly spookey! Especially the seance and ghostly moans....I am even a little afraid to play it at night! I really look forward to getting more Nancy Drew games and books for my Birthday though, i just love the suspense! You must buy this game!"
4,Message in a Haunted Mansion review by Christina,"I thought this game was pretty good. I thought the stuff about the seance, ghosts, and ""spirit of Valdez"" was kind of goofy, becuase I don't believe in the occult or anything. But other than that it was a good game, although easy to solve."
1,Damaged,Arrived damaged in plastic. Tag looked chewed up (if you care about such things) and one of the feet was ripped almost all the way through. Sent back immediately.
2,"ok, 2 and 1/2 stars really...",i got through about half of this. i've read many outlines/paraphrases in this biblical vien. don't read this poorly written book.
2,Was Opened!,"the watch came without battery, went to a store to replace it and the manager informed me that the watch had been opened because the gasket was totally ride with the top"
1,Sorry excuse for a watch,"Sorry I bought this. Got it in Nov for a Christmas present. It is very difficult to set, buttons don't work like the instructions say they should. Took me 1/2 hr to set the time. Wrapped it and when it was opened at Christmas the battery was dead. Had a new battery put in and the light doesn't work now. Would never buy it again. Sticking with Timex."
5,love the fragrance,Wonderful salts to relax in after a tough day in the office. Definitely will purchase more as this was an awesome value.
3,"Enjoyable, but not as good as I had hoped","These are perfectly enjoyable bath salts, but you need to use a lot more of them then I am used to requiring to get a good scent and soft water. This makes the jumbo size much less jumbo, thus less of a good value. The peppermint scent overpowers the tea-tree, but that is not really a problem for me, as I enjoy the minty smell. There are a few small stones in the mix, not really a big deal. I would be happy to use this product again if I find it on sale, but at this price I probably won't buy it again."
4,Set up info for this great produce,"I ordered this Weber grill. It took about 2 weeks for free delivery. I wanted to have everything in place to quickly hook up the grill to the natural gas line when it arrived, but I could not find anywhere on the internet what fittings were needed to hook this grill up. The only information out there from one post turned out to be incorrect in noting that ""a 1/2 pipe fitting"" is needed.So now, in order that everyone else will be prepared and have the information needed on this grill, IT TAKES A 3/8 INCH PIPE FITTING which hooks directly to the quick disconnect hose. For those not experienced in pipe fittings, this is a regular pipe fitting, and not a flared or compression fitting.Wish I had known this when my arrived, but hopefully this will save everyone else a trip to Home Depot on the day the grill arrives.Continued good grilling on this great product from Weber."
2,Nice Ti set but with manufacturing defect,"I have been looking for nice Ti set for camping, and finally found it in Amazon at very cheap price! The Ti set is really light and good for backpackers. Unfortunately, I found one my of set (I bought 2 sets) got manufacturing defects, the fork is bent at a smaller angle, which looks quite weird when I stack them together.Hope Brunton should do better QA on their products.Apart from this, the Ti set is quite nice! But buy with your own risk (you never know the angle problem if you buy 1 set only!)."
5,Less expensive than identical Optimus Titanium Cutlery Set,"This is an excellent product. It is absolutely identical to the Optimus Titanium 3-Piece Cutlery Set (fork, knife, spoon) by Optimus, with one significant difference:it sells for $6.15 less. Need I say more?"
1,Leaks,"Bought this for the girl scout leaders and the first time they tried to use it, it leaked! Lesson here is to check items as soon as you receive them!"
1,I sent mine back,"I used it to heat water for tea and instant coffee. The first time I used it, I filled it about 1/3 full, and there was horrible brown stuff up to the water line. I washed it very well and used it again, filling it a little higher this time. The discoloration was bad, but not quite as bad - you could see both lines. After calling the company and being told I should return it to the ""store"", I went online and Amazon immediately sent me the shipping label and it was returned for free. I love Amazon. I would not buy this again. Now I have to find a proper pot for keeping water hot for a whole day."
5,Weest Bend 58030 Automatic Perk,"I owned this product before, and the power cord wore out over the years. I was pleased to be able to find an identical replacement. I use this percolator for brewing tea and other hot beverages for large groups, and have found it to be a wonderful time saver. If you've got the need and space, I highly recommend this product."
4,I use a lot of hot water,"It has almost become traditional in our family to get me this item, new, for more years than I can remember. It works 24/7 at our house, but at just about 1 year of age, it starts dripping water either around the spout, or actually just dripping. I guess it would be a worn out washer perhaps?In any case, this years urn didn't make it a year, but fell short by 3 months.I'm shopping again for another, but can't give 5 stars.. quite."
5,Great Coffee Maker,"Brews one cup every minute. Excellent tasting coffee, great for a crowd. Highly recommend."
5,Senior Citizens Love Their Coffee!!!!!!!!!.,"I purchased this item for Vintage, a senior citizen facility in Pittsburgh. It's great. The coffee is easy to make, stays hot. Thanks Amazon.com for the ease in facilitating my purchase."
4,West Bend Coffee Maker,This coffee maker worked very well...the coffee tasted great...it stayed very hot! The price was great too...Love it!
3,Basic,Its good for what it is but there could be improvements like you dont know when the coffee is done and it keeps perking until you remove the center stem. But it does what it was built to do and that is make coffee enmasse.
5,West Bend Coffee Pot,The product arrived in a timely manner and worked beautifully. I was very pleased with both the product and the service. Thank You.
2,Read carefully- it is made of aluminum,"It says it right there- polished aluminum. I did not pay attention when I read the description. I purchased if for my office, but several people did not want to drink from it for fear of aluminum poisoning (which is reputed to cause damage to your nervous system). I can't say if this fear is well founded, but I didn't want to drink from it either. Now it just sits there and we purchased a Kurig cup at a time maker that we use daily. (The Kurig gets 5-starts btw.)"
3,More plastic than I appreciate,"After using a friend's 30-cup WestBend coffee maker that was a few years old, I was excited to get my own. This one has plastic handles, plastic top, and plastic grounds tray. This is all new for this latest iteration, but far too much plastic for my preference. It doesn't even look as good. On top of this, the spout was bent at the hilt when this unit arrived. Since it's not leaking, I'm going to end up keeping it because it's really the best of poor choices out there for 30-cups."
4,coffee for a crowd,"I ordered this percolator because I was tired of making multiple pots of coffee at family gatherings. Now we can all have coffee, at the same time, without having various carafes with varying temperatures of coffee! Well made and it does exactly what it's suppose to - make a lot of good coffee."
4,Good Coffee Maker,I purchased this coffee maker for my church. It works really well. Just be careful because the coffee it makes is really hot!
4,It's great but needs a paper filter..,"I bought this coffee maker for our small office of 11 people. We love it! There is only one thing they could do to make this coffee maker even better, make paper filters for it. We find that the filter doesn't work well enough so we create a paper towel filter every day and that seems to do the trick. Otherwise it's a great coffee maker."
5,Coffee Maker,Been using West Bend for meetings of 10 to 70 people for a number of years. They last and deliver. Have tried other brands and none came close to the cost/performance of the West Bend products.Truly satisfied.
2,Coffee flavor not as good as my auto drip/fliter maker.,"I was hoping for a larger batch coffee maker so I wouldn't be making two pots with my auto drip/filter maker each morning. This unit produced coffee that had a 'burnt' flavor.The coffee was at a much higher temperature when done than my auto drip/filter maker. Also, the exterior of this maker gets dangerously hot."
1,"Maybe I did something wrong, but...","Everyone else seems happy with this thing, but I have been very dissappointed. No matter how I scour and wash the inside of this urn, I am always left with a gritty, oily deposit on the bottom. When I refill the urn with water and heat it (I use it only for hot water, not coffee), I get an oily film on the water. It is unuseable and I will have to replace it. For what it's worth, I do not get these deposits or oily surface on the same tap water when boiled in a regular kettle. Avoid this product!"
4,Enjoy the rythm!,"Love this CD and gifted it to relatives. It's different, but if you like African music, you'll love this one."
4,Exceptional value.,"I don't like all of these recordings. The 1st is brutal and the 9th is poorly recorded. But Szell's Eroica is the best (I mean it) and the 2nd, 5th, 7th, and 8th are very solid, particularly the 7th. I don't think much of Beethoven's 4th and 6th so I can't comment, but I am greatful to have solid recordings of the Egmont and Coriolan overtures. This set is certainly better than any of Karajan's. I recommend that you suppliment it with Norrington's 2nd and especially Reiner's 9th. You don't need to buy the famous Kleiber 5th and 7th because these are on the whole just as good."
5,At LAST... The REAL Version of the Robin & Marian Score is Released!,Taken from a remaining/surviving Safety-Master this is the original source material for the original John Barry score.Don't bother with any of the the other versions -- including Barry's own re-recording with The City of Prague philharmonic -- this is The Real One and no one has ever been able to reproduce it so well.A must have for any John Barry score and/or fine film score collector!
4,Chara de Rie review,"A nice selection of songs by the great idol/voice actress Tanaka Rie. This CD contains her some of her famous works from Chobits and Mobile Suit Gundam SEED, as well as some original work. A good buy for anyone who is a fan of Tanaka Rie, or of anime songs in general."
5,This book is one I loved! Please help me find a copy!,"I'm trying to find a book that I read years ago. I thought the name was ""the disappearance"". The premise was that in an instant men were in one realm and women were in another. Two parallel time frames. I would love to find a copy of this book. Can anyone help me? A Lady in Red"
1,Ken Burns does not know anything about JAZZ!,"I don't understand... Why do people love this film so much? You get a bunch old clips and pictures then some really meaningless comment repeatly throughout the whole thing. Is this call documentary? Is this really what people want? There's no discussion about the evolution of the Jazz... There's no discussion about the true spirit of Jazz... All I hear is ""This guy is great, that guy is a genius"" and bunch of meaningless comments! And they totally ignore and trashed one of the most important period in Jazz history. If you are a true Jazz fan, you know exactly what I am talking about. If you are not a Jazz fan yet, avoid this at all cost! This film will mislead you to the history of Jazz!A good jazz documentary film I recommend: Ron Mann -- Imagining the Sound"
5,The Real Deal!!,"Musicians, jazz lovers, and historians will be greatly inspired by this series. Finally, someone tells the true story!!"
4,"It's not perfect, but its pretty much all we have","I will admit that this series has its shortcomings, however no one else has even attempted to produce anything better. I'm no great lover of Ken Burns, but he did at least attempt to bring the history of Jazz to the masses in some form or another. It's not perfect by any means, but if it can spur the interest of even one person to delve into the music itself then the doc and Burns have done their job. To all the naysayer's I propose that you shut your traps unless you yourselves are planning to raise the money, do the research, conduct the interviews, edit the material and produce a ""more definitive"" documentary on the history of America's only original art form? And to those morons that claim that this doc is somehow ""racist"" towards whites, you should all just shut the f*** up!"
1,stupid,"Jazz documentaries usually fumble regarding the past 40 years, but at least they try. Ken Burns doesn't even bother. He leads the jazz hungry masses down a long, boring and twisted road.9 out of 10 people will say, ""Sure, I love jazz, I just don't know much about it."" Is this documentary is supposed to guide them?What a flop!All of the ""products"" that go along are even worse."
1,A disappointment,"This story of jazz relies on Wynton Marsalis, Ossie Davis, Gerald Early, Albert Murray, Gary Giddins and Branford Marsalis to give a cliched notion of jazz and blues that steers clear of scholarship. A metaphor for the whole production is the segment when Ossie Davis is describing the blues as a 12-bar form when none of the examples being played are in the 12-bar format."
2,Highly slanted history of Jazz,"I've watched this twice now on PBS, and I'll give it two stars for production values and covering Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. It doesn't get any additional stars, as it virtually ignores too many pivotal jazz fiqures from the 50's to the present. Three episodes on swing is too much. Spend your money on cd's, the Jazz Icon series of live performances on DVD, the Jazz 101 book, the movie Round Midnight, or the Legends of Jazz DVD set instead.It's not that I don't like Ken Burns either, as I bought the Civil War VHS set when it first was available in the early 90's and then the DVD set when it became available. Had Burns done as good of job on Jazz as he did on The Civil War, then I would have given Jazz five stars."
2,"All heat, no light","They say that a professional football game has 22 minutes worth of action spread out over three yours. In ""Jazz"" they spread it out over 17 1/2 hours. Whoever it was that actually made this film... should do a documentary on talking heads ... because you get enough hot air to refill the Goodyear blimp. If you're stuck for $140... watch it... but keep your finger on the fast-foward button."
2,Wasn't there when it happened,"Being somewhat wobbly in the knees at my age has some advantages. The superficiality of two young men, neither of whom knows much about jazz or was alive when the major movements took place (Burns and Marsalis) set me back. The overwhelming emphasis on black musicians should be a little less whelming...for example, where are Pete Fountain and Al Hirt when discussing the New Orleans style(s) and the role of the black funeral tradition? I rate it two stars at best."
4,Jazz from the Heart,"Ken Burns' Jazz is not a complete, detailed history of jazz. Nor is it an academic survey of jazz. It isn't even a review of jazz meant for a jazz aficionado. It is rather a glimpse into the feeling of jazz, the creativity of its greatest artists, the emergence of a native American art form interwoven with the history of 20th century America. It's a glimpse at toe-tapping music, soul-searching music, plaintive music. Most of all, it's about joy (Louis Armstrong) and love (Duke Ellington) and human resilience. I recommend it to all who would like to learn more about jazz or to anyone who yearns for a positive look at our people and our life. I hope that our nation's youth - many of whom do not receive many messages of joy, love and resilience - are inspired to carry on the tradiiton of great jazz creators and appreciators."
2,Where are the Guitars?,"I enjoyed the history of the horn based jazz moment thru the '30s. But Burns hires talking heads who do not think that ""real"" jazz ever used electric instruments or goes beyond horns and piano.When the guitar of Charlie Christian arrived as a lead instrument in jazz in the late '30s, it needed and had a small electric pickup. Thus it is completely ignored as being relevant in jazz, to Burns and his stooges. All the wonderful guitarists since Christian are also ignored, acoustic and electric.No wonder Burns thinks jazz is dead."
4,Great Study on Black History,"The best thing I like about this documentary is that it is a great study on black History. But it needed to deliver more on what it was supposed to be Jazz Music. I can't believe he left out the great jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery. Left out Roland Kirk and Keith Jarrett. very little on dave Brubeck. Should have talked about classic Jazz Albums like Kind of blue, Time out (with the song Take Five) A Love Supreme, My favourite things, bitches Brew etc. Also nothing on Milt Jackson and the great Modern Jazz Quartet. Ken burns must realize there's is more to jazz than just the big band swing era. But still a great study on black history which makes it worthwhile just for that alone. and nothing on jazz hip hop. songs like doo bop song(miles Davis) and Jazz thing (gang Starr)"
1,Rating the DVD not the Series,"I am not going to contradict the reviewers that have raved about the series, I think that as a Television series it's very good. But if Ken Burns considers himself a filmmaker then he should be using the full video and audio range available to filmmakers. The Full-screen format and the flat sound were very disappointing. The sound recordings of the music weren't even stereo. Let alone worthy of the reproduction capable to DVD.And a note to PBS, I really really really Hate, the forced commercials at the beginning that went on and on and on. With, of course, the fast forward and skip buttons disabled. I'll think twice in the future before I buy a DVD associated with PBS."
1,Buy jazz CDs instead,"If you are interested in learning about jazz,buy (1) a decent jazz history, such as Ted Gioia's A History of Jazz, and (2) eight or ten representative recordings: Louis Armstrong's Hot Fives and Sevens, Duke Ellington, Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, Miles Davis are all good places to start. Or buy the Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz (is that still available?). Burns' bloated product, while containing plenty of nuggets, is too unreliable and biased to be worth your money. Rent it if you must, glean it for what it's worth, but please, there are better ways to spend that kind of dough."
1,Ken Burns: Jazz (which to him is big band popular dance music of the 20s and 30s),"After seeing this poor, one dimensional account of ""Jazz"" known as ""Ken Burns: Jazz"" - an approximately 20 hour documentary devoted almost entirely to Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman, with only grudging mentions of later artists like Charlie Parker and John Coltrane - I look forward to ""Ken Burns: Rock"" which will undoubtedly be 20 hours of Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley with cursory mentions of artists like Elvis, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and Jimi Hendrix.This should have been called ""Ken Burns: An Obsession with Middle of the Road Pop/Swing of the 20s and 30s and His Distain for the Real Spirit of Jazz found in Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, and Ornette Coleman."""
3,A Survey of Jazz according to Wynton Marsalis.....,"The subtitle of this documentary should read Jazz according to Wynton Marsalis or more appropriately A Survey of Jazz ( according to Wynton Marsalis). It is interesting to see Ken Burns own discovery of Jazz, but you can't help noticing that the musicians were chosen were all picked by Wynton Marsalis. This bias hurts the validity of the film that is called ""Jazz"".I am trained a jazz pianist and I have been a jazz fan for almost 10 years. I was surprised at how many jazz musicians, Wynton Marsalis left out talking about (Django, Stan Kenton, a section on the Latin influence in Jazz, Bill Evans, Chick Corea, Keith Jarrett etc).I still enjoyed watching this for the artists they did include talking about. The footage and the music chosen was really good."
4,"Well-made and interesting, but I didn't need to buy it","I really enjoyed watching this documentary all the way through. It's very interesting and I learned a lot about jazz figures I only had a vague idea about in the past. However, I don't think anyone but hard-core jazz fans needs to OWN this documentary. I bought the series, thinking I'd probably return to it again and, as I have to the Ric Burns ""New York"" documentary, but I don't feel that level of connection to it. It's certainly worth seeing for everyone interested in jazz, history, race relations, or larger-than-life personalities but I'd make it a rental."
3,Engaging but massively flawed,"This series played a major role in turning me into a ardent lover of jazz: the sights and sounds you'll encounter are truly memorable and moving, whetting your appetite for more. But as so many other jazz fans have noted, vast swathes of the music (like the last four decades) are brazenly and inexcusably ignored in favor of portraying the ultra-narrow, retrograde Wynton Marsalis/Stanley Crouch version of jazz history--a perspective most jazz fans and musicians vehemently disagree with. If you'd like more balanced, less biased, more insightful histories of jazz, check out the books Jazz 101 by John F. Szwed and The History of Jazz by Ted Gioia, for starters."
1,CIVIL RIGHTS DOCUMENTARY,"Ken Burns made his fame and fortune by being politically correct. Every documentary he makes is basicaly a Civil Rights documentary and a BAD one at that. He knows NOTHING about Jazz. This is going to do MORE damage to peoples concept of what jazz is, than the radio station CD 101.9 in NYC did for twenty years until it FINALLY went away."
3,Where is Fats Waller?,"Maybe I've missed something but in the narrative on Louis Armstrong's rendition of ""Black and Blue"" there is no mention of the song's great composer. I've not seen all the tapes but I think that any mention of great black composers that doesn't put Fats up there with Duke, or maybe even ahead of him, is a terrible oversight. Would like to hear comments from anyone else that has noticed this."
3,It's all in the details,"If Ken Burns attributes rock and roll to Elvis Presley (disc 9), then how many other facts did he get wrong? When will white Americans stop taking credit for what an impoverished and disenfranchised group have created. I understand that not everything can be covered in an 18-hour documentary. However, when you start changing the facts, then how can your research be taken seriously. If Elvis DID create rock and roll, then I guess Chubby Checker, Bo Diddly, and Little Richard ripped him off before he got on wax himself. It's a very entertaining series, but please, give credit where credit is do. The series also touts jazz as being THE only American music form. What about rock, rhythm and blues, and rap? They weren't created in France, Germany, or England. They were created right here, in the great US of A by its black citizens."
1,Burns' most-flawed work,"I highly agree with several others on Amazon - much is left to be desired in this documentary. FIVE MINUTES were spent on Armstrong's ""Hello, Dolly,"" (which has as much to do with Jazz as Britney Spears), while Zawinul, Pastorius and other giant figures were given no mention whatsoever. I believe that Burns felt comfortable with being W. Marsalis' ""ventriloquist dummy...""The good news is: There is plenty of room and time for someone else to produce a more inclusive and comprehensive history of this music."
5,Great Series,"If you like music you'll love Ken Burns' Jazz. It is very thorough, thought provoking, and well worth the time it takes to watch."
5,Best history of jazz,"Emphasis is on early history of jazz. Musical performances are long enough to be enjoyed, not just samples. This is a treasure."
4,Jazz by Burns OK,This is a good but not great documentary. Objectiveness seemed to be lacking because nearly all the interviewed experts were somewhat enamored with the art form. The observer may feel the documentary too narrow in its scope. More artists should have been included. The ending did not measure up to the rest of the film.Ken Burns does show the rise and decline of a unique art form. Jazz starts as a peoples music that was especially embraced when it became a dance music. The decline of jazz started when it became too cerebral and introverted. The heavy use of drugs among the performers at the same time added even more distance between them and the audience.The film duly shows why performers like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington were earth shakers felt round world. It does also bring up things not usually discussed in American History like the race riots during WW2. It's well worth watching.Jazz : A Film By Ken Burns
2,Jazz with a Straightjacket,"Ken Burns-Jazz is something of an oxymoron, if you associate the term jazz with expressive freedom and experimentation. Specifically, by the way that Mr. Burns ignores and even denigrates the brilliant work of the sixties and seventies, he seems to pigeonhole the music into a rather narrow format of musicians improvising on mainly traditional european song construction. He can't understand Mile's brilliant manipulation of blues and African influences, and so labels what was perhaps that last great burst of jazz innovation as ""selling out"". Lord knows what he would have thought if he had ever had the nerve to attend one of Sun Ra's rapturous sessions. I mention these two artists because during this time of stagnation and purified recreation the re-issues and release of concert performances of the two stir more fan enthusiasm than anything going on right now. Give this a couple of stars for its discussion of the early history."
1,Burn's at his worst,"I love all the works of Ken Burns, but this one falls way short of all his efforts to date. So much time is devoted to Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington that I feel much more could have been told. Also was the feeling that this was more the Afro-American history of Jazz and so many greats of jazz were sadly left out. To much commentary from Wynton Marsalis and not enough from other great jazz musicianwho have been inspired by the greats of Jazz. Sorry, but it just could have been done a bit better."
1,One of the worst documentaries about jazz I've ever seen.,"This film is horrible. As many reviewers have pointed out already, the subject matter, which is about jazz music, is not complete. There were very key movements in jazz that were not even discussed. The documentary ends in the early 1960s when the jazz style of bebop was still being played. This is incomplete and a waste of film, because everyone who loves jazz like I do, knows that jazz didn't end in the 60s.This film was a total waste of time and effort. Also, why do I want to listen to Wynton Marsalis ramble on about his views of what jazz music is or should be? He's a bad representation of the music. There are thousands of great jazz musicians that should've been interviewed or at least discussed for that matter.I also want to complain about the price. You're going to have to take out a loan to buy this piece of crap. Absolutely ridiculous price for a ridiculous documentary."
5,"Jazz, a winner from any perspective","Beyond entertaiment, that there was plenty of, it gave us history, knowledge, and valuable information about the scourge of racism."
2,incomplete and skewed with some nice sections,"Burns clearly is not an expert in Jazz and is relying heavily on Marsalis, who has picked and chosen his favorites. This is good for Marsalis as an artist, but bad for historians. I hate to say it but White and Latino jazz musicians get very little due. (Marsalis again). Buddy Rich, Benny Goodman, Joe Pass, Bill Evans, Chick Corea, Larendo Almieda, all of the Latino players discovered by Dizzy, etc. Way too much time is spent on a handful of his favorite, albiet great artists. The worst part is there are no complete performances. To learn the most about jazz you have to as Miles Davis said ""Go back and sit down and listen"""
3,broke quickly but worked well,"the quality of the parts is not the highest, but for the price... while putting this into my sump, two pieces broke off which i was able to glue back together, once in and running took a while to work up but once operating worked well removed a large amount of material."
4,Solid product - decent fit,"This is my 2nd sunshade. While the first one fits like a glove in my 2012 VW Tiguan, this one for a Nissan Frontier while well cut didn't seem as exact. It is still by far the best sunshade I've ever owned and it significantly reduces heat in the car and on the dash, especially during long hot Georgia summer days. The one for the VW is a 5 star purchase (PERFECT), I had to knock one star off this one for the fit."
3,"She is very feminine, you are a bit effeminate and I am effete","Very useful and highly entertaining book. Good explanations, clear examples and well written.However, it has two problems that should cost a star each:- The layout of the pages is quite bad. A reference book like this cannot afford this type of blunder. In all cases it is very difficult to quickly find the actual definition of the words under study. You need to read the whole thing to be able to find it.- Some of the pitfalls are a bit ludicrous. Do people really confuse Libertarian with Libertine? Industrial with Industrious? Livid with Lurid? Ad hoc with Ad lib? De facto with de jure? In cases like this the author just shows examples of correct usage--perhaps because it would be very difficult to find examples of incorrect usage."
1,Didn't fit!,"This didn't even fit in my door. Luckily, I was able to save the old hardware from my previous door and use that instead. It stated for mobile homes, but something just wasn't quite right..."
5,Former Boy Scout,Was very pleased with this item. I learned a lot that I never knew before about the early years of Boy Scouting.
5,Scouting for Boys,Something I was looking for to give as a gift for adult scouters. It was a great item and they all enjoy it.
5,Caution,"The only thing I wish to add to these reviews for this edition, is, please exercise caution. It depends of course if you are after a true facsimile (or the real thing if one comes up) or a reprint where licence has been used, either courtesy of the BP estate or without their permission seeing as there is only until Jan 1 2012 before all editions pre 1942 are out of copyright. This edition has not been replicated 'as is', it almost is, but not quite, there are many corrections and shiftings. If you are just after the flavour of the times and the spirit of BP, then this is fine for that. But it cannot be called a true facsimile, for that I would expect scanned pages and any new type to only be added where the original pages are too poor to be used."
3,Fair read,"As a Tami Hoag fan, I was a bit disappointed in this book. It didn't have the suspense or tension she put into most of her other books. I'm not a love story fan and this book seemed to be all love story and sex. If you're into that stuff, read it. You'll love it.I would recommend these two book by Ms. Hoag if you want adventure and suspense mixed with some romance. Kill the Messenger had no love story, but it's an excellent read.Kill the MessengerStill Waters"
4,love story,Fairly predictable story. But still entertaining.Gives hope to all adults that there is someone foreach of us.
3,Hoaky Title,"This is the first Tami Hoag novel that I have read. It was very similar to a Sandra Brown romance novel. Very formula, with less sizzle than Brown's stuff for me. Not awful, not wonderful just ok. Some of the writing style, especially in the beginning was very hoaky and cliche.The story is about a counselor for wayward girls who fall for a Congressman (AKA the White knight). The ending dragged for me. It was a stretch with a typical plot --heroine is not good enough for the hero.Overall just okay."
3,The White Knight,"I enjoyed The White Knight by Tami Hoag. It was well written, yet totally different from her other books. This book dealt with a home for troubled girls fitting into a neighbor, where the neighbors did not want them there; especially one individual. A politician steps in to help. The story twists and turns around events that start to happen around the neighbor once the girls move into the neighborhood. As time goes on the politician and the counselor become involved with each other and who is doing the all the vandelism. Will good conquer evil? Will love prevail? What do you think? It was a light reading book that I enjoyed. Lynn Sharrott did an excellent job reading the book. I had not ever listened to her before but I enjoyed her reading tremendously."
1,boring,This book was not at all like her other books. This one was boring and predictable. It felt like a first-time romance writing experience.
2,"love Tami Hoag, hate this","I really like Tami Hoag's writing, even her romances but I couldn't even finish this one. Boring, characters were forgettable."
2,keep your money,"Tami Hoag should have stuck to mystery and suspense...leave this kind of crap to Danielle Steele. The word cheesy doesnt even begin to cover it. Hard to believe she used to write romance, because thats what this book is. And not a good romance at that. Buy one of her mystery books."
2,Couldn't Believe My Ears,"I honestly couldn't believe my ears as I listened to this disappointing performance. It seemed to me that what we have here is Messiah-as-soap-opera, that is to say gobs of drama--much of it unconvincing--along with considerable unintended comedy. The tempos are simply too extreme, to the point that singers and instrumentalists are frequently unable to articulate. Mind you, there are some good moments, and several of the soloists are excellent. Finally, though, the person seking a dramatic version of Messiah would be better with McCreesh's. And my basic recommendation would remain with Hickox."
2,disappointing,"Another disappointing recording from Marc Minkowski (although his older recordings were not this bad). The tempi are just out of order even for an authentic performance. The recording itself is excellent, and so are the performers. The only problem is in Minkowski's approach and interpretation. Too bad!! Not recommended unless you are a collector of Handel's Messiah CDs."
2,"Radical is one thing, freakish is another","I admire Marc Minkowski and his excellent Louvre ensemble, but what was he thinking here? Except for a few numbers taken slower thn usual, his tempos race madly, to the point of freahishness. If you don't know what you're getting in for, every number will make you blink tiwce--it doesn't seem conceivable that a good musician would commit this kind of bizarre distortion on Handel, even in the name of authenticity. I guess the amazon reviewer considers 'radical' a word of praise, but not in this case. It's a shame that Minkowski's chorus and soloists are generally superior since they are asked to sing while chasing after a fire truck.I doubt that my opinion will be popular here, but newcomers might welcome the warning. To my ears, this Messiah is unlistenable."
3,This book should be more concised.,"Too many blabbings. After 50 pages still going nowhere. If Mr. Ing tried to portray some of the ""old farts"" as he continuously reminded us, he himself should not become one of them by blabbing so much digressive and irrelevant contents. I've read Mr. Ing's other books, but this one seems to come of age too much"
3,"Not quite the final album I'd hoped for, but lyrically strong","Lucky Dube was one of my favorite artists, reggae or otherwise. But I found Respect to be somewhat of a disappointment, without the standout tracks of Prisoner or The Other Side, and without the wonderfully moving variations of Soul Taker. The pace never really changes.The lyrics are top notch, however, and enough to make you hurt for the loss of a great man. In Celebrate Life, he sings ""Some people don't know what life is worth, some people have the front row seat at the gates of hell, you could be having problems right now, but there's no problem worth your life. People fight to stay alive every day, cause they know, life is worth more than worries. So you got take what you can when you can, make the best of it."" So true."
5,Respect,"I have my copy from South Africa since the album release (2006) This album is worth the buy, it's contain great music that I'm sure you will enjoy; my favorites songs are respect, shembe, changing the world, shut up and monster. There is a song ""dedicated"" to politicians (political games); it's always good to have somebody ( Lucky Dube) to stand and speak truth in behalf of his people. It's really sad to know that now he is gone.I don't think in my lifetime to see someone to make music like Lucky Dube did since Peter Tosh and Bob Maley ever again. Thanks Lucky for leaving us your great music. Enjoy this great album."
5,Excellent Interview resource,THis book is an easy read and clearly explains how to conduct interviews. The book helps the reader progress from the proposal and questions to the actual interviews. As a PhD student beginning to do quali research I have found this to be a very helpful resource.
4,Interveiwing made easy,"This book makes interveiwing easy and simple, especially for qualitative research. This book will make my research and qualitative course that much more enjoyable."
2,Design is ok. Quality is very very bad.,"The quality of this product is bad.Cord is too long and brown, while the lamp is black.The cord was also half cut in one place. Had to use electrical tape to fix it.The threads connecting the parts of the lamp are bad. You will need to be very careful otherwise the lamp will not be strait.And the most ineresting fact: If you use regular light bulbs as recommended for the side lamps the bulbs stick out from the lamp! It looks bad. You will need to find 3 inch long PAR20 bulb and then it might be ok.I put 2 stars only because if you will overcome all the quality problems the lamp looks ok. Otherwise it is like zero stars."
5,A ChessCentral winner,"This is another fine tournament travel set offering from ChessCentral. The zippered bag is especially nice for carrying the pieces, and there's enough room left over to put a scorebook and some pens insisde, too. The extra pair of Queens is also a handy addition to the package."
1,Redi tabs were flimsy,This is a great idea but the tabs are flimsy. We went back to the regular tabs.I also had a hard time getting the tabs to stay upright.
2,muy rapido,"Compre este video para regalar y decidi verlo y saber si podia hacerlo yo misma, pero me resulto muy rapido y largo. Esta disenado como para entrenadores no para gente ordinaria porque el lenguaje que ella usa es un poco confuso."
5,Finesty talc ever made!,"This is the same talc used at my barbershop. Everytime I use this it reminds me of the very end of my haircut and the barber finishing it off with a dash of Clubman Pinaud Talc. Great product especially for athletes because it absorbs moisture that may cause athletes foot, plus you don't have that miserable, wet feeling all the time when you use this! Buy it!"
5,Exactly what I expected.,The best I've used. I'm so glad I bought my first order a year ago and I just placed another order.
2,its pink,"the smell is the one you remember from the barber shop, but dont think that this can be used to control moisture. it will stain things pink."
3,i like it.,smells just about as good as the riginal that the 1970's barber that i remember used. not bad. i would buy it again.
2,Clubman Pinaud Talc,The item received is not as pictured or advertised. Smells similar but contents not the same. Comes in a white container with a generic white label that says Pinaud bath talc.
4,Classic Mens Talc,This hard to find Talc reminds me of my first barber. Ordered and received quickly.
5,Classic,"I use this talc after shaving my face and head. Using this on the hairline on the back of your neck and over the top of your ears seems to help soothe the skin a bit after I buzz my hair off. I love the smell and it reminds me of the barbershop visits from when I was younger. Great product, great smell."
4,FLESH COLOURED!,"Talc is talc after all. And although this type is NOT medicated, it IS flesh coloured! Neat indeed, unless God blessed you with a complexion other than light tan...in which case you're apt to come off lookin' like a Michael Jackson impersonator."
1,Foul Stench,"I have never liked the stench of talcum powder. The odor of talcum makes me queasy.Even though I can't stand the smell, this product does a lot for preventing moisture accumulation.The smell alone made this product not worth it to me. I found other products that serve this purpose that don't smell bad.While it may have helpful properties, the smell alone drove me from it. I hate the stench of talcum."
1,Cancerific!,"Bought it, loved it, then threw it in the trash when I found out Talc is as toxic as asbestos.[...]"
5,The best!,"The best investment into BBQ cooking you can make. These grills last forever, on the rare ocation something fails it is easy to get replacement parts. These grills outlast the cheap ones by at least 5 fold. If you do the math, 5 x $200 ($1000), you can see what the real worth of this grill is. Oh, excellent cooking too. You can not go wrong. I bought mine 2 years ago and do not anticipate buting another grill for 20 years."
2,This model has sheet metal grates!,"One would think Weber would follow their own advice. On their web site, they clearly state they make the best grills out there, and they also state the best grills should have stainless steel or cast iron grates. Guess what they have in this model? Stamped sheet metal grates, porcelain coated! About the cheapest quality one can think of.I got my grill yesterday from Amazon, and discovered this fact only during assembly. A call to Weber revealed a few interesting facts: They sell several variations of the Genesis Silver A, but dont call out the differences. They dont reveal this cheap little trick on their web site. Only the Silver A sold at the big Home improvement store has the Cast Iron porcelain grates. Price: the same, no matter where you buy it.Advice: if you want the good stuff, that Home improvement store is the place. If you are willing to fork over the list price but settle for cheap sheet metal grates, go to Amazon.Tacky tacky tacky..."
1,Needs improvement,"After our cat walked through one time we have had to tape the door open or he will refuse to walk through again. The door closed (rather hard) on his tail. I felt really bad for him, as I encouraged him to walk through this thing. It didn't hurt him enough to upset him, only enough to irritate him. (He didn't yeowl or hiss, etc. but he did turn around and glare at the door, and then at me.)If that fuzzy stuff on the plexiglass part (between the plexiglass and the frame) were longer, or fuzzier, maybe it would be gentler on cats' tails.I feel that this door was made for dogs. Cats have longer tails, and their tails are sensitive. So, this product is probably OK for a dog, but not for a cat."
3,poor customer service,"I bought this grill. Its very nicely made of quality materials.The problem I am having is with getting a pressure regulator replaced. Sometimes it has low heat, othertimes it burns up dinner when set on low. Weber told me that it would be 3-8 weeks to have a tech sent to look at the problem! Amazon says they can do nothing! Weber will not resolve by overnighting the part, just wait 3-8 weeks and we look at it.My 15 year old BBQ gave me less grief, wish I would never had bought it online........"
5,My first Weber!,"Well, as others have said, the packaging was great and set up was a snap. You do need two people to put the Grill on the base. It took about 15 min to put together. It started on the first try. It gets hot very fast. I pegged out my thermometer in about 5 min. The first meal was chicken wings and asparagus. It was Fantastic. Tonight we are grilling more asparagus, Portabello Mushrooms, Corn, a few other veggies and Brats! The cookbook that comes with the grill looks pretty good too. I also bought Weber's Big Grill Book. I guess the biggest difference in this grill and previous grills (charbroil's, sunbeams etc.) is that I now plan on really grilling. Not just doing hamburgers, chicken breast and hot dogs. I plan on making the sauces and using the grill to make really good meals.******One Month Follow Up******Still love the grill. Cooking out about 4 nights a week. Had a great July 4th BBQ for 15 people."
5,A beautiful grill,"I ordered this grill for my husband for Father's Day and it arrived today. I was pleasantly surprised that my son and I assembled it in 15 minutes! The stainless cover and grids looked fabulous and expensive. I hope never to see rust again! We grilled sausage for dinner tonight and it turned out great, with nice grid marks. It was very safe to ignite the grill, no bursts of flames like my old grill use to do. The Weber grill is very easy to use, we barely read the instructions at all. the only instructions that I had to read was the gas connections. I love the burner because I can now pan fry vegetables while I am grilling.I shopped around before deciding to buy it on-line. ... I also saved money on shipping and taxes as well.My friends love their Genesis Silver B, but they really love my Genesis Gold C grill because it looks nicer and the burner is a wonderful addition. Hope you will enjoy yours."
5,Can't wait to fire it up!!,"After reading every single review on Amazon about the Weber's, we finally decided to buy one. We had the cheapo grill for a few years now and the old grill is pretty much fried. Amazon has the best deal around. Pretty much everywhere you go it's the same price...Assembly was a snap. It took, in total, no more than 30 minutes. Everything just fits right. No hammering to make things fit. The shipping service was awesome. Especially because it was free. In stead of the 2 weeks it estimated, it came in 4 days; ordered on Sunday, and it was here on Thursday. They called ahead of time to set up an appointment and they were right on time. Not bad for a freebie.We have not had a chance to fire it up yet, but everything just looks and feel right. You pay a little more, but I think you get so much more.Can't wait to fire it up!"
3,Overall good. Handset volume not enough.,"Overall, the phone is good for its price. You get a decent amount of features. The only drawback is that volume on the handset is not loud enough, even if I have the handset volume set to the highest level. I have a noisy house and I need to hide in a closet to speak to someone. Other phones that I have owned do not have this problem."
2,A waste of money at half the price,"I bought this phone at a major retail store on clearance for $25, and I was initially pleased because I like AT&T phones, and I don't need lots of bells and whistles. All the features it describes are there and the speakerphone works well, hence my generous 2 star rating. But the extremely frustrating low volume from the handset is inexcusable, and I DON'T have a noisy house. I'd developed cauliflower ear from trying to hear what the person on the other end is saying. There's also an annoying flashing red light at the top that blinks after each new message (separate from the New Message flashing lighted button) that can only be halted by hitting the last incoming call CID check button- I see no reason for this feature. Trust me, buy anything else."
5,Very fine Partnership,"This is one of the finest examples of the beauty of this music, Szell and Cleveland play like angels with super tone and excellent support of the soloist...to me it does not get better than this!"
1,"A book about art, not an art book.","I just received what I thought was the ultimate tome of Howard Pyle's work, but was extremely disappointed by the content. This is something of a catalog of his work that pays very little regard to the value of actually seeing the work. Encapsulated in two thick heavy volumes is a wealth of data about Pyles career his pieces. But the entirity of the pictures are contained in half of one of the volumes, and ALL of the pictures are about 2.5 inches tall- nothing larger. For someone interested in cataloging and mindlessly auctioneering, this is acceptable, but for those of us who want to look at art it is completely useless!"
3,Good while it lasted...,"This was a nice little percolator while it lasted. My only issue was - it rusted out and had to be thrown away after less than 2 years. I'm not sure what the life span of one of these things should be, but I would think longer than 2 years?"
4,It was a gift for my mother.,My mother really liked this program and now she can share it with her college students.
4,A look into the Criminal Mind,"Anyone familiar with criminal profiling or forensic behavorial science will find this A&E documentary insightful. This documentary gives a brief historical perspective on how the FBI's BSU became such an intricate tool for law enforcement in solving serial homicide cases. It also documents the cases of some of the world's most notorious serial killers like: Gacy, Dahmer and the psychopath, Charles Manson. This is a great starting point for the criminalogist- but for deeper insights, explore the pioneering research works of Douglass and Ressler."
5,Excellent boook!!!,Excellent boook!!! Excellent boook!!! Excellent boook!! !Excellent boook !!!Excellent boook!!! Excellent boook!!! There is nothing more to say! Excellent boook!!!
4,Useful reference for system engineering,The product is in unused and well condition. There are some scratches on the hardcover only. The contents of the products are very useful for system engineers and the system engineering process.
5,Still working after 20 years,"We installed our door in 1991 and I estimate our dogs have used it something like 100,000 times. The door closing springs are beginning to show their age, and we've had to replace the weatherstripping a time or two, but overall we've found the Plexidor a very solid product that's well worth the price."
3,Know When to Stop Writing,"This book was gripping and intelligent for almost 250 pages. It reminded me very much of Gorky Park, one of my favoritie novels, in the way it blended politics, murder, mayhem and foreign concepts of crime detection. But then the author's late 20th century political agenda intruded, destroying a well crafted novel. After a book filled with numerous bumbling errors by the detective, many of them fatal, the detective decides to join the communist forces reestablishing a Czech state. The last line of the book informs us that this is the detective's worst mistake. Really? In the era of word processors, the biggest challenge is often knowing when to stop writing."
4,Disturbing and compelling,"I have read this novel twice. Both times I was disturbed and fascinated. The interplay between the German ""mole"" and the Czech policeman is dynamic, especially since they have their eyes on the same girl. I also enjoyed the descriptions of Prague. I must confess the ending of the novel left me with a sick feeling, both for the horrendous murder and the political disaster which was to come. Overall, a compelling read."
4,Riveting!,"Set in Prague, during World War II, this novel blurs the genre line between historical fiction and literary mystery into a quite pleasurable read. The richly described setting revolves around a quite interesting murder case. Kohout manages to bring together characters from opposite sides of the War, and makes them both surprisingly sympathetic as they work together to solve this string of ghastly murders. The tension - from both the murders and the War - mounts with more tragic events and a few too many Homeward Bound-style near misses, making the book hard to put down.As well as entertaining, I found the book to be somewhat educational as well. While I knew many of the generalities of Prague's WWII history, this book really opened up a lot of the details. And for a translated novel, the fast pace and use of language all flowed naturally and kept me completely engrossed in the story. It really felt like a flawless translation - and a thoroughly enjoyable read!"
1,No Stars Cuz No Star Wars Figure,I too was a victim of never receiving the figure. My son and I ordered this way back in April and never received it-what's the deal with that???
1,What is taking so long.,"I ordered this figure back in May. I says on the web site, item to be delivered July 25-28. But the status is not yet shipped. I have seen this figure in retail stores and I am wondering is Amazon ever going to ship my figure."
3,Be careful,This is a very cool figure for collectors. It sits on my shelf and looks great. You have to be careful though as a friend of mine got one of these off eBay and somewhere along the way Vaders helmet fell out of the thing that makes it go up and down. So now he either has to open the figure and fix it or keep it as is with the helmet rolling all over the place inside the package. So if you cant find one in a store and chose to order one online just keep this in mind.
1,Star Wars 500th Figure Darth Vader,"I am very displeased with my package. I am a collector and the package the figure is in is damaged. I did not plan to open the package just leave it in the original package because it would be more valuable. It is so crushed, that I am unable to do that. I am not pleased at all."
1,where's my figure!!!!,"I ordered this way in advance and still do not have it! It was anticipated for June 7th delivery. Thought there was just a back up but if you check over at E-bay, people are selling it. How did Toys R Us not get it?"
1,Has anyone seen Darth Vader?,"I wouldn't know how I can rate this because I still have not received this. I ordered this way back in Apr and it is no where to be seen. Either the release dates (Star Wars Battlepacks/Evolution) keeps getting pushed back, other sites have it though, or it all of a sudden becomes unavailable (after I already ordered it). I have been a loyal Amazon.com user and this has me questioning my loyalty."
5,"You are in command now, ADMIRAL Piett","This item is a cross between a toy and a collecters item. The pics. online dont show the detailed scars on the back of vaders head. The capes are made from fabric, not plastic. Inside the meditation chamber, there are stickers but , thankfully, you dont have to put them all on. Darth vader himself is very accurate, but i havent changed his hands for fear of breaking him. It is a little pricely though. i would have expected to pay about $10. Pssst- the crane that puts his helmet on can rotate 360 degrees! Overall this diorama/figure will serve whatever purpose you choose for it well."
2,A Little Small,"I should have looked at the specs on this, but I thought the figure was a little SMALL, and I am going to have to open it up, as ole Darth's helmet fell off and is rolling around in the box. Other than that ... it looks pretty sweet!"
3,... due to the sound quality,"They're all great... except the sound quality!Giuseppe Taddei is as wonderful an actor as he is a singer... All the ladies are gorgeous (and I do have a special affection to Christa Ludwig... her ""reverenza""s are lovely... almost sexy). Karajan's direction, though on the slow side, is never dull. Except for the orchestra (VPO v/s BPO) there is no mahor difference between this and the Philips / DG recording, except that this is hampered by a very poor sound quality and a too audible a hiss. How come Sony did not re-master this recording?At any case, try the La Scala / Muti or Giulini... Both deserve a 5-star + !!!"
4,Karajan DID have a sense of humor,"I bought this for Giuseppe Taddei, one of the all-time great Italian baritones. And he is clearly one ofthe great Falstaffs. Many have praised Renato Bruson's take on the title character, but for me is abit too dignified and even solemn. I'll take Taddei's Falstaff any day. (Although I really likedPaul Plishka's interpretation.) The other great performance here is Panerai's Ford, which couldhardly be better. The ladies and young lovers are good but not outstanding. I don't know whyChista Ludwig took so much criticism - this great mezzo is perfectly fine as Quickly. And for meit is a major bonus to have two of the best comprimario tenors, Piero de Palma and Heinz Zednik,as Caius and Bardolfo. Karajan's production is not the best but is more than adequate. At thisprice, this is well worth purchasing."
3,Every things works - but for the age of the re-production,"Accordingly, it is for a colelctor and not a first choice...its an all star cast and conductor....and is as acheivable as is reasonable given the age of the production and the reproduction techniques."
5,Publish Again in the US!,"I love this book. For it's size and story I would consider it an easy and enjoyable read. This book is the true life story of the Lennox sisters. This story is beautifully put together by Stella Tillyard who compiled the sisters' letters to piece their lives together. Although the sisters lived a life considered ordinary for aristocrats, their life was anything but ordinary. Two elope, one was the object of a King and one extended family member led the Irish revolution. This story is almost too good to be true, but it's amazingly true"
5,Excellent,This book is great for teachers as well as parents to help them understand how a boy with a disability thinks and feels. A must read for teachers who have students with dysgraphia.
5,' Happy ',"This CD totally seduced me! A mix of highly sophisticated music with extreme naivety.Here is my favorite thing about it: the band plays this weird JAPANESE POST-DISCO CLUB MUSIC, which is totally unique! Their style is so true, authentic, it fills my head with stories and images of an 80's Japan, and fills my heart with naive happiness.Then, without being the major thing (but still essential to their charm), the music is also very rich in content. The rythmns are complex, the songs hold dynamic structures, the band members interact with each other on intensity, and so on. The result is creative, but very clean, even though the organ is tuned in this weird tonality (octave splitted in 43 or something).Give it a try! Everyone falls for Syzygys!"
5,An Authentic and Well Researched Book,"This book was filled with history and information about the various holidays and special occasions celebrated by Italians and Italian Americans past and present. It included traditions related to Christmas, Easter, Saints' Days, and so much more. There was clearly a lot of reserach that went into this book. I also loved the inclusion of stories and shared recipes from real people, which gave it a personal touch. I highly recommend this classic, charming, info-rich book."
3,good,"You gotta like these guys. They sure know their records. Most of their covers are knock-offs, this one being King Crimson's Earthbound.Acid Mothers have a firm grasp of acid/art and space rock, and they glory in the tradition. In their music and their cover art, they reference Can, King Crimson, Zappa, Amon Dull, most of the heavyweights we know and digest as gospal.Most of this album is free form jamming. The band is very genuine about this and have a genuine love for the music they affectionately pillage. It certianly is not for the fame and sports cars.So if you have all the classic albums and want more, Acid Mother's is the band to hear. They may be musical pirates, but they have absolutely robbed all the right ships."
4,I think this book was very good.,"I bought this book after I had already beaten the game. I only bought it because I am a Star Wars collecter, I wouldn't normally have bought a game guide. I was reading through it, and to my surprise it was written basically in the form of a first person novel. I really enjoyed the fresh perspective of a civilian worker (Maarek Stele) on a Star Destroyer, and this book is well worth reading."
1,Broke in one day...a total waste!,"This toy was great for the 5 minutes it worked. Literally, by the second day it was broken and wouldn't work at all. I tried to return it to Amazon and their vendor (eToys where the toy came from) and they never responded. This was a total waste of money and I can't believe the incredilby bad service I received from Amazon. I have been a loyal customer for a long time but they never even responded to one of my emails. The toy is a terrible. Don't waste your money. If you insist on getting it make sure you get it at a brick n' mortor store where you can physically return it because Amazon won't help you."
3,Well built... for the most part,"This track and train set seems very durable. My one year old seems to enjoy it. As a few others have mentioned, we have had problems with the train making one of the turns on the figure eight. It ends up off track and stuck. But, my kids really don't seem to care about that flaw."
5,Beautiful! Touching!,"This is a wonderful read. It's the loving story of two sisters journey through life and death. It will touch your heart - make you laugh - make you cry. The author's style of writing is engaging...Oprah, are you listening? this would be a perfect choice! It makes a great gift for you and everyone you love."
5,Fred and Jan Yager Hit the Mark Once More,"In their latest suspense-filled yarn, ""Just Your Everyday People"", the Yagers have gone beyond the crime novel genre to create a work with a literary theme that should challenge any modern reader. That theme is fidelity and how the lack thereof can undermine the stability of the best of marriages or the fondest of friendships. Which is not to say that the book isn't a good read. It's real page-turner too!"
1,Defective battery charger,"I ordered this battery charger to replace one that stopped working. This charger stopped working within 2 weeks of getting it and after less than using it 10 times. It overheated enough to melt the plastic near the metal connections. The store said they would replace it immediately and said not to return the charger. My first charger worked for several years and it is possible the problem could be with my original battery causing the charger to go bad, so I am purchasing a new battery."
5,Black and Decker 12v charger,This charger is to replace the original one that came with the drill. The original one sust stopped working leaving me with 2 batteries that I could not charge. charger matches the original one in all aspects except for one. This one works.
1,using dewalt charger,I am so glad I read these reviews! My husband had a Dewalt charger DW9108 for 9.6-18 volt batteries and my batteries charged up in no time!! I really did not want to buy a third charger! So thank-you all for taking time to write these reviews!
1,Crap,Junk as well as being dangerous. Throw this away immediately. Black & Decker should be ashamed to include this chargerwith the drill.Buy: Black & Decker PS1MVC 8.4-Volt to 14.4-Volt charger[ [ASIN:B0001YVYEG Black & Decker PS1MVC 8.4-Volt to 14.4-Volt 1 Hour Pod Style Battery Charger]]
4,Perfect,"I have had my drill for years (so many I can not remember how long it has been), I have not been able to use it in over five years because the original charger has a break in the wire somewhere. I purchased a replacement battery at the same time. I plugged the charger in, the charge light came on, worked great. I went with this charger because it fits in the original case and it is not some bulky device that I will have to keep up with. Even though this charger is light and is seems cheaply made, if it is stored properly in the drill-case (which I did not do with the original one) I feel it will last quite a while. It is so good to have my drill back, it works great."
1,Not Good,"This product pictured was purchased for a specific battery and tool. When it arrived, it was the wrong product, it did not fit the battery. We sent the battery back to the place of purchase, were called and advised the correct one was being shipped out, and to date, we still have not received the correct battery charger. We were called over 2 weeks ago. Needless to say, if the item purchased has indeed been for the tool it said it was for, we would be using the tool this date."
1,PS160 12 Volt Charger #418352-01,"This is a piece of CRAP ! It lasted about 30 mins. and did the same thing as the orignal charger, I wasted money on sending it back"
2,It will work for now.,"Next time I'll get the more expensive model that shows the state of charge, if the battery is no good, and shuts itself off when the charge is complete. If you put a bad battery in this , the circuit board inside melts and you have wasted your momey. This model doesn' shut off when the charge is complete and overheats the battery."
1,Do Not Bother. Waste of your money.,"What a waste of money that was...As soon a battery with possibly one ""bad"" cell (somethingcommon as most rechargable batteries have several cells)is inserted for charge, within minutes the charger goes out.Dead. for the trash... There is also a letter enclosed bythe shipper with every order that in order to replace the chargeryou will have to ship to them your batteries for examinationby their experts.. (that's because the know that they are sellinga bad product and most buyers try to return). DON'T BUY IT.I gave it 1 star because review will not allow to continue with 0."
1,made in china,Product became hot and started to melt. Gotta love the smell of burning plastic. Fortunately I was there so the house didn't burn down. And fortunately I bought this on amazon so I got my money back...promtly.
5,Prompt delivery,I was pleased with prompt delivery of charging unit. My husband is enjoying his Black and Decker tools. This was a very hard item to find with the battery being even more difficult to find.
4,Charger,I liked it very much. I don't like the requiement the I need to have a number of words to complete this review. Pain in the but.
1,Poor quality,Bought two of these products over the past year as replacements to the failed product that came with the drill and each of the replacements failed after only a couple of uses. Replaced it with the B&D PS1MVC and have had no problems so far. Perhaps the better solution would have been to stay away from B&D altogether.
3,"Disatisfied with seller, too late to leave feedback, hope people will see it here!","I don't have a problem with Black and Decker products, but the seller performed poorly. I waited too long to post feedback, so I am posting my commnents about the seller here.I ordered this B&D; charger base from the Buy-it-now-store in November of 2010. When I found the part did not fit my battery powered drill, I wrote to the seller requesting return authorization.To this day I have not heard back from them. The item came with no return address, thus I was unable to return it and receive a refund.Seller rating: 1 Star Seller: Buy-it-now-store"
1,battery charger,"I purchased this after my original one failed after several years use. This replacement only lasted 2 months. I subsequently bought a Black and Decker unit that was more flexible and could be used with other batteries, and it is working well. I would not buy this again"
1,starting Melting,Used once and noticed a burning smell. After realizing the light wouldn't stay on to show a connection to battery I noticed the plastic around the light was melting.
1,B&D PS160 Charger,"The PS160 Black & Decker charger arrived on time and in good condition. The supplier fulfilled their obligation perfectly. BUT, this charger has some kind of design flaw and began to fail on the first use. The original charger had also failed when the circuitry overheated, melting the plastic housing. Thinking this was an isolated occurrence I ordered a new charger. The new charger got so hot that the same heat caused distortion of the plastic housing began within an hour of use. Black & Decker should supply a re-designed charger that works properly. I would NOT recommend purchasing this item."
3,junk,"works good it your battery has any kind of charge on it, but if it's completly dead don't plug it into the charger or it will damage your charger and you can then throw it away!"
1,Bad batt. charger,"Received charger on time as promised. burned up the first day. will have no futher busines with this vender and yes, the batt was charged with another charger from another vender"
1,bad choice,Unless you have a good battery this is not the one you want. Stay away form it if there is any question whither the battery is good or not.
5,just right for my 12yr old drill & 4yr battery-----thanks,"a-1 b/d has been my tool choice for 30 yrs. hadthis drtill for 10plus, works fine and love it. it will probably outlive me"
1,DANGEROUS!! FIRE HAZARD!!!!,"This is my 1ST (of 2) purchase of a replacement charger (FROM 2 SEPARATE SUPPLIERS) for my Black and Decker PS130 battery...BOTH of which started MELTING after 15 MINS of use! After comparing these with my original damaged charger, it becomes obvious that these are NOT OEM from Black and Decker...BE WARNED!!"
1,didn't work,When I tried the charger it would not charge either battery for the drill. It seemed not to work since the units normally get warm during a charge and a light comes on. Nothing like this happened.
2,No built in protection,Product Fried as I was charging second battery. Charger does not have auto shut off or a way to signal the battery being charged is a bad battery. I need a 51ohm resistor to fix it. Waiting for Radio Shack to order me one. My Sears charger for my other tool set tells when a battery is no good any more.
1,Do not buy this!,"Do not buy this charger. This is a classic example of getting what you pay for. I purchased this and it burnt out after charging 1 battery. After reading additional reviews it is very apparent that it can't handle charging a completely drained battery. Instead, buy the slightly more expensive (but higher quality) Black and Decker PS1MVC multi-charger."
5,Great buy,"great buy at a great price, if you want a replacement at a low cost this unit is for you. love it and I love the low cost"
1,No good,"This charger is waste of money. I placed my battery on the charger it work for about 5 minutes. Then I started to smell smoke coming from charger. Not only my charger was burn up but it now had killed my battery forever. I am electrical engineer so all the specs were right for my battery. I open charger up and circuit board was fried(faulty board). Now I can't send back and need to buy new battery,charger and drill. Still MAD."
1,Do not purchase charger,"The battery charger arrived on time, (kudos to the Amazon site), but the charger quit working in one day. It didn't even charge the battery. I now have two B&D chargers that do not work. I am afraid to order new batteries and another new charger. (If they do not work, then I would have spent more than I would purchasing a new drill). I guess I will buy a new drill, but not a Black & Decker."
1,Avoid like the plague !!,Bought one of these when my original one quit working. It worked maybe 3 months and then died. Don't buy it -- get a Dewalt one (from eBay) that works fine and doesn't burn out like this one.
5,PS160 12 Volt Drill Battery Charger,My drill had not been used for 3 plus years because the charger would not work. After sitting that long I took a chance and ordered a new charger. I had two batteries one of them would not charge but the other one charged and is holding a charge. I have not had the occasion to use it a lot but it seems ok.
1,TERRIBLE,WENT THROUGH TOO MANY..NO MORE. USED COMPLETELY AS INSTRUCTED BUT THEY MAKE THE BATTERY SEEM TO GO BAD. EITHER WAY IT DOES NOT WORK WELL.
1,never again...,"this charger burned out within less than 10 uses, would get extremely hot. it also burned out 1 of the original batteries for the drill. I thought it was an original black & decker product but by the looks of it, it was a cheap knock off that ruined my battery"
5,Black & Decker Charger,"I,ve been using mine since the late 1980's!! still working--just replaced the weak battery last week.---Excellent Product for me."
1,Awful product,"This was a complete and utter RIPOFF. The product does not work and never has. I am very disappointed and would not buy anything from this merchant again. I want to give zero stars but apparently I cannot give less than one.Thank you,MJL"
2,"Not their fault, but it only worked for an hour","Their instructions said to check the battery before using. We did and it was supposed to be fine. After it charged for one hour, the light went out and it stopped working. My father, who is an electrician, said that the battery had shorted out the charger."
5,The greatest ballad singer around today...,"Carol Sloane is one of the greatest jazz ballad singers around today, she doesn't have to scat to improvise(not that she can't, she just doesn't very often), however she does take one number very hot on this gem of a cd, Ellington's ""Cotton Tail"" which she does as a vocalese(yes, the Lambert, Hendricks & Ross version). Most of the tunes are taken at slower tempos which is fine with me, for no other singer makes ballad tempo songs sound so interesting, and full of so much variety, particularaly ""I'll Buy You A Star"",&""I Never Went Away"", although this cd is a classic all the way through, there are no duds here. So support one of our last great jazz balladeers and you'll be doing yourself a favor too!"
4,almost perfect,"In a bad and crazy world, the voice of Carol Sloane is the ideal antidote to every sort of anxiety. She is simply the finest singer of ballads today. The album opens with the beautifully understated ""I See A Million People"", with guitar accompaniementby Paul Bollenback. There are sweet surprises like the rarely heard Billy Strayhorn tune""Maybe"", and a song callled You're Not So Easy to Forget"" with its alluring verse intact. Invariably the arrangements for voice and guitar are the most succesful. I was eager to hear what Carol would do with Bart Howard's wistful ""I'llBe Easy To Find"", but pianist Norman Simmons' wayward accompaniment put a dent in the proceedings--indeed his piano on Deep Purple and I Never Went Away seemed to put Carol Sloane at a disadvantage. In the past she has been supported by pianist Mike Rienzi (Romantic Ellington) or the brilliant young Bill Charlap, so maybe it's a simple case of a listener being spoiled by perfection."
1,DO NOT BUY A WORM LIGHT,"Save yourself the trouble of having to return it. The worm light puts out very little light, and you have to try to position it so the light doesn't just reflect off the screen. The price is right, but these lights wear out very quickly. You would be much better off buying a light magnifier for your system."
2,"Don't waste your money --- and your batteries,","The Wormlight sounds good, doesn't it? ""You can play your Game Boy Color in the Dark! Isn't that cool!"" Yes, my friends, it is cool. That is, if it didn't use your GBA's batteries. No big deal, you say? What would your impression be if a drunk came up to your door and freeloaded off you for the rest of your life? There. Now that we share the same point of view, DO NOT BUY THIS LIGHT. IT WILL DESTROY YOUR BATTERIES' LIFE, AND TRUST ME YOU DON'T WANT THAT."
2,Poor Connection,"The light itself is a great enhancement tool for playing the games, but the connection to the Gameboy is very poor. After only a few uses, the light would not stay attached and my son became very frustrated while attempting to use it."
