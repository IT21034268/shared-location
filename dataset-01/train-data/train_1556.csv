4,I really don't know what to think,"I have to be honest and say that I find the reviews of this book a whole lot more interesting than the book. However, without commenting subjectively on the content of the book, I must concede that the author wrote from her heart and how can anyone question her feelings.Still, I find the reviews almost ""bloggish"" and will return to this page just to continue reading the reviews. This is rather exciting."
2,Martha Beck fails in this tome,"Martha Beck, notwithstanding being the daugther of the late Hugh Nibley, perhaps the most well-known Mormon apologist and scholar, not only lies downright about being molested by her father (her siblings, some who even shared the same room with her when such abuse allegedly occured, deny this, alongside her mother), shows a complete lack of understanding about the Book of Mormon and Mormonism in general. Moreover, her etnocentric criticism of Oliver Cowdery's proclaimation on the snake-figure on one of the Joseph Smith papyri just shows how this book is not aimed at knowledgeable Latter-day Saints, but those who are utterly ignorant of Mormonism, and so forth."
1,Good story telling,"But that's it. I am so disappointed in Martha - I loved Expecting Adam, though I thought some of it to be a bit far fetched, I took her at her word. I've recommended that book to so many people. Now I feel I was really taken for a ride with Expecting Adam. I suprised myself how let down I feel over that. I might have fallen for her story in Leaving the Saints but her ""lights"", her ""special feelings"", blah, blah, blah are a bit too much. Now I read that after bringing three children into this world both parents at this late date decide they're homsexuals? Where did that come from? And that's a stable environment for her children? Not in my opinion.I, too, have spent years searching for God and have never been blessed with all the lights, etc. as Martha. Seems odd to me. She doesn't seem that special."
1,Anyone who knows the two of them . . .,Anyone who knows both Hugh Nibley and Martha Beck knows who is telling the truth--it isn't Mrs. Beck.
2,Bad motor,The pump was delivered with a bad motor and wouldn't run. The manufacturer sent a service person who replaced the motor but damaged another pump and the pool controller. The cost for these repairs will far exceed the cost of the Pentair pump.
2,A lot louder then I expected,"Pump was very easy to install, direct replacement for out AO Smith. It seems to work well or at least a lot better then our 20 year old pump it replaced however it is quite a bit louder! I was suprised at the noise especially since the description promoted how quiet it was supposed to be! Good price at $278, local stores were almost twice that."
4,Very happy with my purchase,"When the package arrived I was happy with the way it was packaged. Shipping it was easy. I had it installed and the installer said it was very easy to complete., Once it started I could not beliepurchaseve how clean my pool was.. Far better than my past pool pump (Hayward) it was an older pool pump but WOW.. the new once is amazing. Very quiet.Very happy with my purchase."
5,Works well,"I installed the pump a week ago and all is well, it works great. I replaced a 16 year old American Products pump that was originally installed when the pool was built that finally quit, it has since been discontinued so parts were hard to find. I hope I get the same longevity from this one. FWI the label on the motor shows 6.6 amps at 230 volts, not the 7.1 the description shows, I'm not complaining. It seems just as noisy as my old one."
4,Perfect Pump - Easy Installation,"This was exactly what I needed and installation was a breeze - as long as you have some plumbing experience.Keep in mind - these motors are shipped from the factory set to the 220volt setting so be sure to switch it for a 110volt install. Also, this pump is actually attached to a removable base which is awesome. I separated the pump from the base and installed the base first so I could line it up with my existing mounting bolts. After that, the pump slipped right into the base and screwed down. Good job, Pentair."
4,Sometimes you can be SURPRISED!,I was hesitant about this entire transaction. But the pump arrived promptly and well packed. Then the installation was a no brainer. Now my pool runs quietly again! Thank you for a fabulous experience.
1,Didn't last a year.,I bought this pump in May and it worked beautifully for a few months. I turned it off for a vacation in August and all it ever did after was hum. The cost of repair (labor) was more than a replacement of different brand. Suggest staying away for this brand as they do not provide a warranty worht the paper it is wrriten on.
4,Pentair Inground Pool pump,"-Service from Amazon was fast.-Received order in less then a week!-Great price. Local pool store wanted twice the prce for half the motor.-Motor is strong and quiet. Works as intended.Cons - If you are replacing this pump as a do-it-yourself project: be warned that the wireing instructions are vague. You will need an electrition or a moderate degree of electrical knowledge to install the pump. I am not a big fan of the twist off design used to access the filter basket.I have not had good luck with the hayward super pump line. I have replaced 2 in the last 5 years. the overall ""feel"" of this pump is that it is a higher quality. Time will tell."
5,Salad Dressing Helper,"I bought this salad dressing mixer last year in Paris and have been delighted with how well it mixes oil and vinegar dressings before I put them on salads. Because olive oil can be stored at room temperature for a year and to keep the oil liquid, I store any leftover salad dressing in this mixer in the pantry. The efficient design appeals to guys, too."
1,What wus cisco smoke'n,"I applaud the women to try. However, I am truely not knowing what cisco was smoke'n to publish this book. It is better to have no documentation than wrong documentation. This book is filled with wrong'isms. I made two points when hitting the round file with this one."
1,This book is filled with technical errors,"There are so many gross technical errors in this book that I came away convinced that it had never received a serious technical review within Cisco. If so, it would never have been published.Examples:On page. 60, the book shows an IGMP join being propagated all the way back to a video server. This isn't how IGMP works; the only feedback a video server receives is RTCP reports. It is routing protocols that handle setup of multicast routing paths within the network, not IGMP.On page 164, the authors talk about 10-megabyte and 100-megabyte Ethernet. Throughout the book, they confuse bits and bytes so often that it appears that the authors don't know the difference themselves.Looking at the author qualifications, one author is a technical writer, and the other is a marketing person. Not the kind of qualifications you'd expect from authors of a Cisco Press book."
2,Poorly Written,I thought the book would get good after I got through the Chapter 2 ARP mistake. I have read other Cisco Press books and I have found them to be written very well. This book was a big exception. The examples are painfully dull and barely scratch the surface of the issues involved with the problem. I would not recommend this book.
3,"easy to follow, well illustrated, major error on ARP","The book is easy to read and has lots of current information. However, a major technical error that I saw near the beginning leads me to mistrust the whole rest of the book. The author goes into great detail to explain ARP in the section on Broadcasts, but she has it backwards, according to my understanding and the explanation in several other technical references where I looked it up to double-check."
2,"Well-written, but basic, and includes many errors.","The ARP mistakes are the obvious problem. But there are quite a few other technical mistakes also. I questioned the likelihood of a network having 10,000 broadcasts per second. If each frame was 128 bytes, this would be more than 10 Mbps Ethernet. Also, IGMP stuff is bogus. And all mentions of calculating bandwidth usage are strange because they say things like 7 Mbytes instead of 7Mbytes/sec."
3,"Intermediate level info, easy reading and diagrams.","Yes, the expample she gives to demonstrate ARP and broadcast packets is actually RARP. Major Error."
5,moon is rising,another incredible cd----the picture on the cover is better than the music on most blues cd's...buy this and all earl hooker albums--or be a mook----
5,FILM AS ART....,"If ever there were an firmer example of film as art and art as a means to better the world, define humanity and transcend a medium, then this is it. Every film-maker eventually comes to terms with the actuality that only when a film provokes not merely an ideological or emotional attachment ,but an emotional change within the viewer, can it truely be asserted that said film has served its true purpose as an artform. Grave of the Fireflies acheives this and easily becomes one of the grand contemporary masterworks, not merely of anime, but of modern cinema. It should be required viewing for any university film course..."
2,Be warned,"This is THE most depressing movie I have ever seen. Please do not let little kids watch this. This is a heavy movie. I might be mistaken, but I think I heard it is based on real life, which makes it even more sad."
2,"...but, on the other hand",though this anime is well done it dwells upon and drags out every opportunity for pathos. Doing so it degenerates from a potentially powerful statement into soap opera. My suggestion is to get one of Mizuguchi's other works.
2,Didn't care for it,"Yes it was horrible that the bombs were dropped. I think we can all agree to that. However, the Japanese during the war were NOT angels. There were tales of horrible cruelty perpetrated on prisoners and any who lived under them as invaders. I found this movie dark and depressing. THe voicing was eh. My family and I didn't care for it."
4,"It could be a five star release, but...","""Truly, an animation materpiece"".An entire review would be made with just those 4 words.""So, why did you rate it with 4 stars?""The first time I saw this movie was a few years ago on a VHS one friend lend me. With the arrival of DVD, it was logical to get the DVD release instead.But...When I was watching the introduction, something didn't seemed right, but I couldn't recall what until I get to the ending of the movie, then, it just hit me: In the Central Park Media release, the ending is choped and never shown, but at the beginning of the movie.Maybe they didn't wanted to show the original credits in Japanese.I just keep wondering how they dared to mutilate this wonderful movie."
5,Heart breaking,"This is the best animated movie I have ever seen, yet I will not watch it again. I am a huge fan of Hayao Miyazaki's art (also known for Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away). The story was so heart wrenching and well told that I felt myself drawn into the movie completely. After the movie was finished I was sobbing for hours and my husband had a hard time calming me down. I found myself thinking about this movie for days after I had seen it.I have cried durring movies before, but I felt I actually mourned while watching this one.I feel it is almost essential for people to watch movies like this in a society that totally glorifies war. Movies like this, Shindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, The Pianist, Life is beautiful, really wake you up and make you see the underbelly of war and its effects. Though profound, I will not watch this again. It's not the type of movie one would want to watch over and over"
5,Beautifully tragic,"I have been a fan of Miyazaki's work for a long time. He never fails to disapoint his viewers when he makes a movie, and Grave of the Fireflies is no exception. I have seen it more times than I can count, always with the same outcome, I'm in tears and utterly depressed for three days straight. The animation is fantastic, not even Akira can compare to this and rarely does that occure. Miyazaki is a true genious and his work will hopefully continue to be appreciated."
1,Not for Grandchildren,"I have watched Totoro, Ponyo, Spirited Away and other Japanese anime movies. This movie was so depressing my grandchildren where frightened and in tears when it was over. There were many scenes of dying and dead people. Also many of the war injuries depicted were quite graphic for children. I thought I was getting something I could watch with my grandchildren at a Friday night sleepover and was extremely dissapointed. I would not recommend this movie to anyone younger than twelve."
1,It is hard to feel sad for people who caused their own situation,"I had wanted to see this movies forever, then I saw it. At first I was sad by the story of the kids losing their mother. Then they move in with their aunt who at first is nice, but gets annoyed that the boy won't do anything to help bring resources to the family. Annoyed that shw won't leave them be, he takes his sister out into the wilderness where she starves to death. It bothered me that he just let it happen."
1,The most depressing anime I have ever seen. Absolutely dreadful.,"Man, I have never been so depressed after seeing an anime in my life. I know it is a depiction of the real tragic events on the citizens of Japan during the tail end of WWII, but come on. Were the citizens of Japan that heartless? Kids left to fend for themselves and die like vermin? If you were expecting a movie with the redemption of people while overcoming daily struggle, forget about watching this movie. I turned away from this wanting to scream. It was like watching ""Nobody Knows"", another Japanese downer."
4,Sad but Good,"Though this is a very sad movie, its a great story. Its interesting to see history being told from another perspective, not the usual US point of view, instead the ""enemy"" point of view.I recommend if you like good stories, good animation and WWII theme. Not recommended to young kids though."
5,A Must See,"This is perhaps the animated equivalent of John Ford's ""The Grapes Of Wrath"".Like all great art it transends the limitations of it's genre. The fact that it is animated is incidental -- it is simply an extrodinary film, fully of extrodinary performances, images, and emotions.But it's definitely not for the suicidal."
5,A truly moving movie,This movie is far too good to be described in such a plain text. Buy this DVD or buy the VHS-tape. Although the DVD's picture is quite bad it definitely is worth its price... The story of a boy who has to care for his 4-year-old sister in times of war and destruction is so emotional and so frightening that you want this film to stop making you cry... Everybody should watch this movie. Even if you don't like anime WATCH IT! Parents should show this movie to their children.
4,Very Depressing War Story,"This was one of the most depressing films I have ever seen. The setting is Japan during WWII. A boy and his young sister are forced to survive on their own because their mother dies and their father is off fighting in the war. Food is scarce in the village, and the boy does everything he can to provide for himself and his hungry sister. This movie will make you smile and have you in tears."
1,...,"horrid movie. i can't believe how disappointed i am in this anime. i had heard so much about it and how it is a story that is at the same time most touching and sad. but it's not. the little girl annoyed me so much. i just can't stand spoilt kids like that and seita probably would not have died if it had not been for her. omg she just annoyed me so much throughout the whole movie. can't stop ranting yeah... for those who haven't seen it, you might like it like everybody seems to but... i would not recommend it at all"
1,And now for a disappointing review,"to tell you guys the truth i fell asleep after the americans bombed the japanese and their mom died. woot! this show was so boring. the first time i saw it and hopefully the last was when i was in history class my teacher was teaching us about world war 2 and a student brought in this movie and everybody hated it including the teacher we ended up not finishing it and watched something alot better. i have watched some animes like Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away and cant say im impressed mostly likely because they are unrealistic. i have been a big fan of anime since i was like 6 if your looking for something better i recommend trigun, r.o.d., samurai champloo, appleseed, gunslinger girl, cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, and inu yasha."
5,there should be a warning label,"wow. first off i have to say this is an exellent movie. superb animation, exellent soundtrack, just really good all around.now that that's out of the way i have to say that this movie is totally not for the feint of heart. it said on the box that it was for ages 3 and up. that almost doesn't make sence. the film is very very negative. you get to watch two orphaned children die slowly, with an indifferent society that turns away and doesn't look too close.if you like sad movies, this is definatley for you. if you can't handle extreme negativity, then stay away. if sad songs and stories that make you cry feel good to you when you're in the mood, than give this flick a try. i really liked it, even though it was so negative."
2,Beware the item description!,"First of all I just want to say that this is an amazing movie. I give it 5 stars for that. The 2 star rating is for the item description. According to Amazon this version of Grave of the Fireflies should comes with 2 discs. But I only received one. I checked the Sentai Filmworks website and their item description shows that this DVD does indeed only come with 1 disc. Either I have a different version which is not Studio 23 or Amazon has posted incorrect information. As far as special features go, there are none. Basically in the special features menu there are previews of other DVDs you can buy from Sentai and Credits for this DVD. So if you ordering this thinking that it comes with a second special features disc you're probably going to be very disappointed."
2,"Grim, very grim","To describe this movie, I would say it is both grim and depressing. There's no joy and no possibility of joy since joy left for another planet the minute I began playing this movie. If you want to ruin your night and make your children feel really bad, go ahead and get this movie. Otherwise, pick something else that has even the smallest iota of something positive in it."
2,Ok Movie.,"This is a good movie and i do reccomend you to watch once in your lifetime, would i watch it again? probably not, honestly id rather watch The Pianist."
5,The truth of war,I was blown away when i saw this movie for the first time. It is a true masterpiece. Although the story takes place during WW2 in Japan there is no real reference to americans being the enemy making it a movie that still gets the message across without political undertones. Grave of the Fireflies shows you what suffering goes on during war times and makes you ask the question Why? Studio Ghibli's movies may all have life lessons and messages in them but this one was the strongest. It was a real tearjerker but a total classic.
5,Powerful,"To those of us from US and the West, this may look like a cartoon, but is very sad and powerful. A classic."
5,One of the most emotional movies i've ever seen.,"Actually, this IS the MOST emotional movie i've ever seen to date. It brought so many tears to my eyes. It's incredible. After watching the movie, I couldn't stop thinking about it. It haunts you for a while. If I could give this more than 5 stars, I could!"
5,Powerful,When I first saw this anime I thought it was a bit depressing but it offered me a strong message of how horrible and devistating war can be.The movie is bassically about a 14 year old boy and his little sister who have to live on their own because of the war.Their mother gets killed. This movie is great for any age their is nothing bad int it. This is a must see.Any one should add this to their anime or dvd collection. By the way this is a great DVD too. If you want to see some more great movies see Akira and Spirited Away!!
5,Incredible,"Although it's been several years since I last saw this movie, I still remember it as vividly as if I had seen it yesterday. This story will touch heart, and if it doesn't, then you possibly have no heart to touch. And even though I watched the Japanese version, the animation was so astounding that the expressions on the charactcers' faces was enough to tell me what was going on.This film relates the tragedies sustained by Japan during WWII, and in no way portrays Japan as an attacker. Everyone is in a pitiful state, and the main chracters, Seita and his little sister Setsuko asre probabaly th emost pititful of all.The ending wrenches at your heart, and the more faint hearted of you will be reduced to tears, both at the poignant ending, and the pure mastery of the story."
5,Most Heart Drenching Anime you'll ever see,"I would give this movie six stars if I could. It was excellent. For any one who still thinks Animation is just for kids.... just look at this movie and you'll see how wrong such an assumption that can be.This movie was heart drenching. I practicly brought me to tears - a very hard task, I mind you. One of the most horrifiying thing I find about movies like this is the fact events like these really happened. That war does kill. I find it sad that the people of a nation, on both sides, suffer becuase of the goverment's actions.An excellent movie; should be shown in schools, so that it might be known what horror a war can raviage."
5,Excellent Story and Animation,"A movie by Studio Ghibli, animated by Isao Takahata. The Film company is the same that made My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service and The Princess Mononoke(coming to America this year from Japan). Central Park Media have release this classic on DVD and Video. A Sad story about Seito(brother 14yrs old) and Setsuko(sister 4 yrs old), who are in japan during WW2 and the American air raids. Having lost everything, mother and home, they must find a way to survive the horrors of war. Father in the Navy, they don't know if hes dead or alive, Relatives in Tokyo and nearby town, they don't know how to contact them. A story that won the 1994 Chicago Childrens film festival award. Sure to win your hearts."
2,English Version is a disaster,"The voice of the little girl is awful. Just awful. It sounds like someones grandma pretending to be a kid. It reminds of the low budget Godzilla films that are dubbed into English. The children are always voiced by adult women. This little girl has the creepiest voice I have ever heard.Not only did I not cry during this film, I couldn't stop laughing at that girls ridiculous voice. The voice of the girl is said to be done by one Rhoda Chrosite. However, a quick search on google turns up no such person. It's very odd.I recommend watching the film in Japanese with subtitles."
3,caution,ok were do i start. this is a good film if you wont to be depressed. (spoiler) it opens with the mane character dieing of starvation! i'm not saying this is a bad film but this is not i repeat NOT a kids film. this is not your typical Ghibli film either. it is a very sad film that will take you in to the ugliest sides of human nature. if you watched Valley of the Wind or Mononoke and you think this will be one like them it's not. you will cry(you wouldn't be crying if they did a bad job on the movie). again i'm not saying this is a bad movie but don't show it to your kids.
4,"A very sad, but powerful movie","This movie is very sad and is too realistic. It is so real, it is scary. It has a very sad ending, and it is a movie I will not see again. It is not worth it. But don't get me wrong, the quality of this movie is superb. This movie is not really appropriate for the little ones, 8 and under, but that is my opinion."
5,Amazing movie,One of the best wartime movies I have ever seen. Beautiful story. Makes me cry every time I watch it.
5,Truly Great,"To sum up how great this film is to me, I have only this to say: The first five minutes and the last twenty minutes will forever make me cry."
5,I Loved Grave of the Fireflies!,Oh my god! This is one of the best Japanese animated movies I have ever seen! Two fragile children trying to surive in postwar Japan. The older brother does everything to keep his sister alive and well. I shed many tears for this one. This proves that all wars lead to is despair.
5,"Great movie, but very sad","I agree with the other reviews of this movie. It's set in WWII Japan, towards the end when American bombers were wrecking havoc on Japan. Much death and sadness. I cried. I don't recommend preteens watch this just because it's so sad. But it is a must see movie."
3,Cute but depressing and it just get more depressing...,"This movie has the usual beautiful animation of so many Japanese animae films. The characters and their struggles are very endearing. Its a sad story, and it doesn't get better. No Hollywood endings. :("
2,A sad movie about kids too proud to ask for help,"Grave of the Fireflies is a well-made movie, and it does have many emotional moments. However, I was left with a feeling that all the suffering in the movie was for nothing. Basically, the boy and his sister are starving because they are too proud to ask for help from the family member they were staying with. And when they were staying with them, the boy did not make any effort to work and earn money, which made the family resent them. It was difficult to feel sorry for the needless suffering of a boy who wasn't willing to work and earn some money."
2,cheap,"I have seen the movie many times, and it was as good as I remember it being.However, when I received the DVD the casing and the disk itself was made really cheap. I first thought that I had ordered someone's illegal copy that they had hand made. There were a couple language options, one of which was the original Japanese, as a native speaker, I appreciated this option. However, when the movie plays in Japanese there is no option of not having English subtitles, which was really irritating.I recommend this movie to everyone, but spend the little extra and buy a better copy of it."
2,"Great animation, cannot relate to such an inability for a lack of common sense","First of all i would have to say i love animations and this one was beautifully done. Good now that that's over with, i cannot see how a 16 year old boy has such little common sense as this one. I stayed dried eyed through out the whole film because i was waiting for the main character to do something with sense. He did nothing. I was remotely sad when they both died, but honestly i saw it coming a mile away from when they left the aunts house. Emotional distress or not that is not an excuse for being so naively blind or indifferent. The movie made me more mad at the main character than sad to be honest so u watch it and enjoy."
5,A movie that almost made me shed a tear,"I'm new to amazon reviews...so i'll start with this one, which i recently bought. To start off, I'm a 21 yr old college student that doesn't really cry when watching movies, but this one startled me, especially when is it just an anime that made me almost shed tears.It's about an older brother and a younger sister who tried really hard to survive a war against the americans when they bomb'd japan. It's a very mela-dramatic movie based on the japan vs american war. The two had to endure man days of mal nurished and tried really hard to stay alive during the war, but the body can only do so much, espeically when you're only 12 and 4 yr old.Ppl, give this movie a try"
5,Hits you like a train,"A wonderful movie.At first it's sad when at the beginning both of the children die,but it becomes sadder as the movie progresses you see just how special the relationship of Seita and Setsuko was.It gets sadder still when you see that Setsuko is to sweet a little girl to die the way she did,horribly. Even though the movie's music and animation was incredible so was the silence.The silence after the sequence of flashback scenes that showed Setsuko playing around the shelter after she died was mind numbing.The music is wonderful I've gotta buy the C.D. When you buy this video you have to realize that it will effect you.You will think about this video this video will change you and your kids but all for the better.And just a little note. Buy the subtitled version,it's so much more meaningful.Grave of the fireflies is more then just 2 hours of hollywood tragedy.It's a story beyond words"
5,Stunning,"This movie was an absolute masterpiece, worth anyones collection. It transcends both animation and acting, becoming a story of innocence - and lives - lost in the midst of a brutal war."
5,the ranking isn't fair for this movie,"They should let us put a 6 stars for movies like this one. Actually there isn't much I can say that has not already been said. I just want to be one more to share my admire for this movie. It is a must for all human beings. As another person wrote, I also found myself crying several days after I saw this movie."
5,Never,"Simply put, I will never watch this movie again. If you aren't moved or feel for these kids....then you don't have a heart.I don't know how I can give this movie 5 stars yet never want to watch it again. You'll have to see it to understand what I'm talking about."
5,beautifully heartbreaking,"I have been a big fan of anime for many years now, but nothing could have prepared me for the emotional rollercoaster this movie was to take me on. I originally saw this movie about five or six years ago, and have seen it about 10 or 12 times in total. Although the experience is now much less powerful than it was the first time, i still find myself caught up in it. It has the power to make you feel happy when Setsuko and Seita feel happy, and when things finally take a turn for the worst, it dumps you right down there with them."
4,Haunting anime,"This should serve as an antidote to anyone who cheered when the Americans were bombing Tokyo at the end of ""Pearl Harbor."" This animated film tells the story of Seita and Setsuko, whose mother is killed during the bombing of Kobe during WWII. The two children struggle to survive and even find a little happiness in a country that is undergoing extreme privation. It is heartbreaking to watch Seita trying to protect his little sister. The film is apolitical; rather than taking sides and laying blame, it strives to depict the complex ways in which human nature expresses itself under impossible circumstances. Thankfully, it mostly avoids the Japanese penchant for terminal cuteness."
5,The only movie to make me cry,"This movie is a classic that should be viewed by any movie fan, old and young. This film is not only entertaining, but touching and beautiful as it shows the very real world that war can create. This movie, as indicated in the title, is the only movie yet that has been able to make me cry so far. So, I recommend this for any movie fan. You will not be sorry."
3,Good story but...,"Great, if depressing, story line and truly an anti-war movie. It was extremely emotional for me and the animation was good. I just couldn't tolerate the little girl's voice in the movie! It definitely sounded like an adult woman trying to imitate a child's voice and it was so incredibly irritating."
5,Grave of the Firefliies,"This is possibly the saddest movie I've ever seen. It is beautiful visually, but it is haunting and will stay with you long after. It breaks your heart. War is horrible for people; even though this film is animated, it still manages to expose the painful tragedy of the innocents, and leaves you with stark barren reality."
3,I've got mixed emotions about this one!,"I have REAL mixed emotions!!! I am giving it a 3 but really I would like to give it a 2 1/2. It really bothered me how Josh practically stalked Megan during the first of the book- he was REAL pushy too-constantly sneeking kisses, forcing kisses. I kept thinking ""where is the respect for her?"" The sex is very explicit, too. It's constant. Megan was too silly at times for me, too. Like her thinking of ruining Josh's reputation? The story is sweet- love (or was it lust?) at first sight, though Megan was faithful to her first husband. I can see where other reviews would rate it high because of the story line- Josh loving Megan sooo much and it being a dream come true for him to have the opportunity to seek her due to the unfortunate death of his friend, Megan's husband. But I really don't think I feel comfortable in suggesting this book."
2,Not worth the effort,"unless one likes reticient women who are constantly in denial, this book can prove frustrating. I am a die-hard Sandra Brown fan, but Megan really startedto annoy me as she had a man who would do anything for her and put up with a lot of rubbish from her. Somewhat reminicent of Linda Howard's All that Glitters which also had an annoying heroine."
1,Lame story and very boring.,"It was a waste of time reading this book. I've read both the Witness and Fat Tuesday and totally enjoyed them but this book was so lame, the story never took off, I could not wait to finish it (only because I had started it and it was a very short book) so I could move onto another book. I am very grateful that I borrowed this book and did not spend one cent on it."
4,Awesome book!,The library at my school has that book. It's been favorite book since I read it for the first time. I love the plot and characters. I also think the love scenes are excellent. Sandra Brown is truly an amazing writer.
3,Christmas gift,I bought this product to give as a Xmas gift. I was very happy with the service and the ease of purchasing from my home.
3,YOU SHOULD AWAYS FOLLOW YOUR HEART,I WISH SANDRA BROWN WOULD MAKE HER FEMALE CHARACTERS A LOT STRONGER. THEY ARE ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT RUNNING AWAY AND NOT FACING SOMETHING HEAD ON. SHE TRIED TO MAKE MEGAN SEEM VERY STRONG WHEN IT CAME TO HER JOB BUT THEN YOU THROW IN A MAN AND THEY JUST FALL APART. I GUESS IF YOU DIDNT HAVE THAT THE BOOK WOULD SEEM A LOT SHORTER. JUDGE FOR YOURSELF.
3,Tenptations kiss,I expected more from sandra brown. This was just a romance novel and very predictable. not exciting at all as most of her books are.
2,Sandra Brown,I've read almost all of Sandra Brown books and this was by far the worst one I've ever read. No substance to the book.
3,Ho-Hum,"This book was okay. I picked it up because I was bored one day and it looked relatively short and it was by Sandra Brown so I figured I couldn't go too wrong. And I didn't. This book moved along pretty quickly, it wasn't a heavy read so I was able to put it down and do things as I went along.The plot isn't too heavy. The characters were pretty interesting. This one I'd save for a slow day."
1,Methinks...,"the lady doth protest too much. I read this book because I thought it would offer, at least somewhat, a rational approach to this topic. However, her whole argument just sounds increasingly more shrill and sadly ends up being unsupported. She is a journalist and relies on emotional appeal which makes her argument all the more suspect. That readers are so ready to jump on her bandwagon shows that there is very little thoughtful, intelligent dialogue about this subject today."
2,An elitist viewpoint on self-help and recovery,"I wanted to read Ms. Kaminer's book with an open mind, which is exactly how I started after picking it up from my local library. However, in her introductory comments she refers to an author as ""Beverly DeAngelis.""It's Barbara DeAngelis, by the way, and she has a PhD.If Ms. Kaminer can't be bothered to fact-check her work, then I really shouldn't be bothered reading it."
1,1 star,"For many months now, i've tried to post a fair and honest review of this stinky book.The author has no expertise in her subject matter, and clearly has not actually read the books she claims to critique.so why won't my review get posted ?"
1,I found the assertions BOGUS and UNSUPPORTED.,"For just one example, The author makes assertions such as Napolean Hill's secret of success in ""Think and Grow Rich"" are based upon the success formula of 'believe in God'. Maybe belief in God is good or bad, but, to my view, it is NOT the bases of Hill's success formula.I've read Hill's books. I think I understand them somewhat. I don't think the author of this book read Hill's books, and certainly does not understand them.SO, If you haven't really read the material, and you don't understand it, and you're not educated on the subject--- How can you write a criticism ?"
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS WAS NOT THE TYPE BOOK I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING. I STRONGLY DISAGREE WHITH EVERYTHING THIS BOOK REPRESENTS.
4,Great message,"Great message! This exposes twelve-step programs for what they are--a mechanism through which others, in the guise of being helpful, attempt to manipulate and control your life. The author takes the position that the best way to overcome addiction--alcohol, drugs, sex, etc.--is to decide that you will take power over that thing instead of resigning yourself to powerlessness and substituting something else--usually the man upstairs or some religeous organization--to control you. Taking control of one's own life makes sense to me, but it may only work for ornery, independent cusses like me who refuse to let others have power over them. Sadly, I have observed that the majority of persons would rather have someone else think for them and make all their decisions for them--the type for whom faith is their only refuge. Perhaps that is why this book was out of print the last time I checked. How unfortunate!"
5,book review,"I loved it! It was a great book; I read it for a class on Freud and his influence on modern self help movements and it was extremely insightful, arrived on time and just wonderful"
4,A Valuable Jeremiad,"This is not a comprehensive history or critique of the self-help movement, nor the last word on the culture of victimhood. It is a very well-written, short, entertaining ""jeremiad"" against that culture, however. I wish everyone would read it--our culture might gain some sense!"
2,"Interesting Subject, but ......","A fascinating story, as Special Forces operations tend to be. However, the author is obviously no professional writer, as the text is disjointed and difficult. Written as a history of each of the reconaissance regiments, some unit receive more attention than others. The actions of various individuals are highlighted, but there is little continuity or development of a consistant thread or theme throughout. Not so much a unit history, as a collection of anecdotes - which is a real pity."
5,"If this doesn't make you feel good, check your pulse.",The blending of classical and metal musics is superb. Tilo and Anne's vocals bring forth a myriad of overwhelming emotions. This is a must buy!!
3,Great and Boring,"This book is a collections of essays by Richard Lederer. I have a casual interest in language and wordplay, but I found some of the essays rather boring. For instance, reading the chapter on fadspeak was just painful for me. It was one long string of catchphrases and slang. On the other hand, some of the essays were very entertaining. Either way there is enough in this book that you are bound to like some of the chapters."
4,A Man of My Word: Reflections on the English Language,"Richard Lederer always entertains while he's teaching you. Years ago,I was given ""Anguished English"" to read on an airplane trip. I got so involved and laughing so hard, I forgot where I was. Everyone was asking me what I was reading. It's been a long time since I read ""A Man of My Words"" but it was typical Lederer. You get an English lesson while laughing. I would recommend all but one of his books."
2,Where's George Kennedy when you need him?,"This movie steals SO much footage from Airport 1975 and especially Airport 77, I kept expecting George Kennedy or Charlton Heston to stroll in at any minute. The footage is so messed up, you can tell it's a different plane in the flying scenes and another one in the submerged airplane scenes!!! For all you Coolio fans, he gets top billing, but is only in the movie for about 40 minutes!"
3,Typical of late Steven Seagal,"This is not a bad movie - it just lacks from a large enough budget to add some frills. One reviewer mentioned the Seagal's voice being so different but if he had really been watching he would have seen that Seagal's lines were dubbed in for some reason. Not all of them, but some. But it is a typical Seagal movie and worth watching."
4,It Ok but not perfect,"The Rev has no weapons but comes with blades.It is shown in both the morning and afternoon series.In the morning series the zoid is used by the Imperiles.In the afternoon series this zoid is used by the backdraft group in mostly unsenchint battles.On land the main pilot would be Polta but he also pilot many others as well as this one.The Rev is small and is not that strong by the looks of it.It needs more weapons then what it has now in the box.I figure if you put the weapons from the Imperior on it it could be stronger,but right now it wouldn't help.It's an ok zoid but it could have been better."
4,Blade Raptor ( rev raptor ),This zoid is awsome. It is my only wind up zoid but it is so cool. This zoid has been in many episodes and has been used by the back draft group. So I usualy have it fight alongside my elephander. The two blades are awsome as well as the movable claws. It may have no weapons but it has spots for them. That is if you have any lying around. I can't wait to make him fight against my blade liger or jager 0 when I get them. This zoid is a must have.
4,rev raptor,"The rev raptor is fast and is basically the same model as the gun snipper but faster it is Quite faster,it doesnt have any where the amount of guns as the snipper does but it does have two slicing blades on its back."
3,Rev Raptor !,"The Rev Raptor is very cool looking and i saw when i saw it in the store 2 day i figured it would be fun to have for and extra Empire zoid. I have for the Republic, the Command Wolf AC and the Cannon Tortoise. For the Empire i have the Rev Raptor and my favorite, a Dark Horn, ...BR>Anyway, the Rev Raptor is horrible at walking but while it does, its claws and blades move, it looks great.I rate this a 3 for fun..due to walking4 for educational...good hands on work....5 for durability because its alrady fallen off my bed and a coffee table."
5,The Rev Raptor,"The Rev Raptor is a cool model. He has 2 blades on his sides and some cool claws. He has no guns, but he does have places to put them if you have any spares. He has a stick you have to place onto his side to wind him up, and he walks very nicely. I highly sugest this zoids to beginners and experts."
5,Rev Raptor,"This is, in my opinoin of course, the best of the basic size zoids, or well, actually, one of THE best Zoids. The Rev Raptor, along with the Helldigunner, are both brand new never before seen Zoids. (Wow, Zoids sure have evolved a lot, if youve seen the first Zoids you'd know what I mean) I heard the Rev Raptor wasn't coming until April and the Helldigunner wasn't coming until May but I'm glad it came early! Does this mean the Helldigunner is coming early too? I can't wait! The Rev Raptor has two big hooked blades on its back. It is a small wind up Zoid. And in response to someone saying this is the Guylos Empire's Gun Sniper, no its not. The Gun Sniper, and the Snipe Master (a better version of Gunsniper) are Sniper Zoids. They specialize in sniping people. The sniper rifle on their tail is its main weapon. The Rev Raptor's main weapons are the two curved blades on its back."
4,Rev Raptor Rules,"The Rev Raptor is one cool zoid. Easy to put together, and very cool looking. Its about the same saize as the gun sniper, but has awesome blades instead of guns; good for close in combat. Its a fast walker, but tends to wobble like most two legged zoids, but it is still a great addition to my team. I highly recomend it."
1,"A rewritten review of ""this is the worst Zoid in existence""","I wrote (okay typed) a review called ""this is the worst Zoid in existence"" indeed it is.This is a better one (meaning worse ya know).Okay I said how it was useless so I used the GunSniper in replacement.I took the RevRaptor apart for spare.Now I recently looked at the instructions I saved and I noticed I had built it wrong.So I put it back together.And it was worse than before.I mean it this Zoid is so horrible.And the stickers cant go on right,and this Zoid is not worth half it's price.The ammoless RevRaptor (that can't do anything) is.............kind a stupid,no wait the very stupidess,they should make it so that it comes with guns,a head that can move,better plastic,make the stickers fit,and make the sythes stay still.But since it isn't that way this really is ""the worst Zoid in existence."""
4,zoids review,"zoids are awesome. when you finish snaping them together they are ready to battle. if you collect more than one you can have competitions, or whatever else you want to do with them."
4,The Awesome Rev Raptor By a 10 year old kid,"To start off it's a very durable zoid.It fell off. my 3 ft. high desk and only the gun popped off.It only took me 30 minutes to build this zoid.The Rev Raptor supplies hours of fun!!I think it was very educational because it shows you how to build things.This is not my favorite zoid.The only guns that fit on the arms are the arm guns of the Gun Sniper and the tail blasters of the Dark Horn(that's the down side ).BUY THIS ZOID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MY LIST OF ZOIDS FROM MOST FAV TO LEAST FAV:Bezerk Fury,Dark Horn,Command Wolf,and Rev Raptor."
2,Rev Raptors,"Rev Raptors are a disgrace to the zoidian world.It has 2scythes and a few claws but not a single round of ammo in its system. i hated it. But get the gun sniper. i have the gun sniper, rev raptor, gojulas, raynos, storm sworder, spino sapper, pteras, geno saurer, geno breaker, berserk fureher,etc. all those dinos. Look at my review for the raynos to see how i got them. Titled I am the Wild Eagle"
3,Kinda unimpressed,"Why only 3 stars? Well, too many inaccuracies. Trust me, I compared it to how it appears in the show. Plenty of places for guns, but has none! The blades are in a fixed position and only move as it walks. This Zoid also requires a ""key"" to wind up, a pet peeve of mine.Ever build a Zoid before? Notice the instruction manual says ""colors may vary""? Mine definite varies. The top of the head is a lot darker than the picture. The rest of the maroon colored body is also tremendously darker than the picture.However it was easy enough to build. Couldn't help but notice a similarity to the Gun Sniper.Buy it you're collecting all Zoid models, don't if you're just starting out."
2,Terrible...just terrible.,"Nothing but the best from the king of highbrow, techno babble. If you really want to foray into the world of nonlinear editing stay away from this book. Read mine...my name is Dwight Camerron and you'll find my book by May 1998, Nonlinear Editing is 'da Bomb."
4,"A fun variety of stories, characters and creators!","While reading ESSENTIAL TEAM-UP volume 1 it dawned on me that the scripts for these comics would be perfect for adaptations into a cartoon series aimed at kids. The stories are mostly of the one-and-done, self-contained variety with very little fat; the heroes meet, a villain does something dastardly...and let the action begin! Spider-Man is one of the co-stars in all but two of the 24 stories collected here which also features appearances by The Human Torch, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Ka-Zar, Captain America and more! In addition to the variety of guest-stars and villains, you also get a rotating cast of comic creators including Gil Kane, Ross Andru, Sal Buscema, Jim Mooney, Len Wein, Gerry Conway and many more great talents from the 1970s era of Marvel Comics!"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Fun, completely disposable Marvel fare, apart from one slightly longer storyline that was a little deeper. Generic formula comics. Superheroes meet, have a misunderstanding, and start to beat the crud out of each other. Then they kiss and make up and go and beat the crud out of the bad guy, generally after someone, or everyone gets captured in the process."
1,waste of money,"Not worth buying it. Poor quality and defective material , many patches of moulds growing ! Would not recommend it to anyone."
4,I serves the purpose.,Great product. Gave it 4 stars as it could use a snap or strap to keep it closed. I use a rubber band and it works. It's one of the necessary items in my bag.
2,Stiff cape,"Even in 1995 the stiff cape on this figure really bothered me. This version of Lando was never able to stand up. Fortunately, the 2004Lando Calrissianrelease is much better."
4,Great film about bullying for any educator.,I enjoyed the film. I appreciate the screenwriters willingness to be upfront with how the boys were reacting to life and it made it real for me. I think this film is great for educators who are needing to see examples of what bullying is all about around the world.
5,"""Pulsates with Excitement""","I was very reluctant to view this subtitled film due to a misconception that it was an overly preachy, overidealized paean to pacificism. Truth be told, it is much more complex, and provides a sensitive examination of human nature and the competing urges toward bravery, cowardice, evil and humankindness. To the viewer, it pulsates with excitement and danger. By design, a number of scenes are emotionally overwhelming and excruciating to watch--but without artifice, special effects or superficiality. Highly recommended without any reservation."
1,unable to stream video,i spent 30 minutes looking at the tv trying to load this movie and when it came on it just kept stopping every 30 seconds - i rebooted the router twice to no avail - i have no problem streaming hd video from netflix - i won't use amazon again - waste of money
4,Twisted,"This storyline is a bit of a departure for Matt Damon. His character starts off super nerdy, but gradually becomes really twisted and dark. I hated this movie the first time I saw it, but after watching it a second time I realized the story is really interesting. I don't want to be a spoiler, but Matt Damon's character has to do some pretty fast thinking to pull off his deception. If you don't like it, wait a few months then give it another chance."
3,Unsettling,"If there were separate categories, I'd give this movie five stars for acting and cinematography, three stars for writing, and one star for how it made me feel. I think I was expecting something more along the lines of Matt Damon's ""Bourne"" films ... and I got something very different. I don't want to ruin it for anyone who wants to watch the film, but it starts out strange in the sense of mysterious and intriguing, and ends up strange in the sense of weird and kind of grotesque. When I finished watching it, I was left in an odd emotional state: kind of shocked, kind of awed, kind of sick to my stomach, and kind of sad. Like I said, though, the acting and cinematography were amazing."
2,I lost patience early on.,"Well before the end of the first hour, I found myself checking the clock and hoping this dull travesty of a story was almost over. The beginning was intrigueing, but it went downhill fast from there. I didn't care about any of the characters enough to give a damn what happened to any of them (with the exception of the final victim, who was the only likable character in the story - making me dislike this film all the more when he was killed). This is a story about empty shells - walking, talking personas with nothing inside. Oh, I have no doubt there are lots of real people like this. The characters are realistic, to be sure. But I don't want to spend 2 hours with them. In its defense, I will say that this film had some good lines of dialogue and great scenery, and the acting was good - but the characters and the story simply weren't engaging."
1,Awful! Just plain awful!,"The Talented Mr. Ripley starts off with tremendous potential and quickly plumetts into the bowls of the movie world. It seemed as though the writers were simply making things up to ad on as the movie went along. Even more shameful than the desperate attempt at a plot or consistent story line, was the unusually poor acting performances of Mr. Damon and Ms. Paltrow. The only redeaming feature of the movie is the wonderful performance of Jude Law, without which I would have vomitted on myself several time from the sheer pain of watching this film. Watch this movie ONLY if you wish to feel as though you were just robbed of a small piece of your life!"
1,A shocker in more ways than one,"I was expecting Matt Daman to be a bit more like he was in ""Private Ryan"". However, if you are expecting to find out anything about M,r.Ripley that is incredible, I can save you a few Dollars. Unless you are of this flavor Mr. Ripley is a talented, psychopathic, homosexual murderer. I wish that was on the back of the box when I purchased this movie. With no offense intended against this particular community it would be nice if they would inform us before we spend the long drawn out moments trying to endure to the end ont this film."
1,"Boring, Pointless, Stupid","The entire time that I watched this movie, I thought, ""what is this getting to?"" The end FINALLY came, and I thought, ""Oh, it came to nothing."" There was no point to the Talented Mr. Ripley. The entire film was boring, giving the viewer little to no excitement. I couldn't get into it. I didn't really know what was going to happen next, but I didn't really care! The performances were fine, and the visual design was excellent. It was a very colorful movie. It was just stupid. Matt Damon portrayed Mr. Ripley, a gay con artist, murdering psychopath who tried to live several identities and got himself into some serious trouble. Let that sentence be enough, because that pretty much sums up a waste of two hours and twenty minutes. Don't see this movie expecting thrills. Expect yawns. The R rating is not the heaviest of them all. Mostly for some violence. There was also a meager amount of profanity, and some brief nudity. I wouldn't recommend The Talented Mr. Ripley to anybody."
1,no talent here,"Bad movie. Not even worth the five bucks to rent. I had to force myself to sit through the whole thing -- hoping for some redeeming quality to come forth. Very disappointing. Story line is shaky, at best."
2,The Personalityless Mr. Ripley,"Okay, true ... so I didn't watch the entire movie. I understand that the quality of the plot varies from person to person, depending on how well you understood the film, but there was one thing that really bothered me about the characters. I don't know if it was the script, the acting, but all the characters seem so fake. From Dickie's moodswings to Marge's happy-go-lucky disconcern for her bf's affairs, to Tom's spontaneous aggressive personality. All in all, if you're looking for a movie featuring real human characters you can relate to, skip out on this one."
3,JUDE LAW STEALS EVERY SCENE HE`S IN...,"A thriller which is not thrilling. The Italian policeforce are portrayed like idiots when the character of Matt Damon is far from clever and HELPED by 2 fantastic solutions...The actors and the Italian landscape are a joy; Jude Law steals every scene he`s in. The film has a strong gay overtone, but as with the story, it doesn`t deliver into a catharsis and the last 30 minutes are full of stupid people who doesn`t seem 2 understand that Mr Ripley is a ""wacko""..."
2,"Boring, beautiful scenery","The scenery and the people were beautiful. But, the plot moves along at a painfully slow clip and the characters are pretty much unlikeable. I couldn't wait for this movie to be over but made myself watch until the end because I kept hoping it would get better."
1,What a waste of talent!,"Utterly ridiculous movie with one of the most contrived stories I've seen in a long time. There are far too many things that don't make sense and exist only to provide later plot points. And to top it off the movie stops at the most contrived points as if to stand up and shout ""Look how clever I am!"". Complete waste of a very talented cast."
1,God Awful!,"This may be a well directed and photographed movie, but that doesn't overcome the serious and obvious flaws it contains.First, the story is BORING! The characters are grating and as the title character bumps each off, you sigh with relief and chalk them up. The only thing ""thrilling"" about this movie is the end credits. I couldn't believe I wasted two and a half hours of my time on this dog. It's one of those movies that you watch because you hope it will get better. Be warned- it never does!The ending is nothing but a loose end and you feel cheated by it.Maybe Mr. Ripley is talented- but you would never know it from watching this waste of film!"
1,I would rather shoove a spoon down my throat,This film was simple awful. While i watched it in theatre i was debating if i should shoove my spoon that i had gotten with my icee down my throat so that i would be entertained. This was a sick movie that someone would have to pay me to go see. If you buy this movie then you must also like to stick needles in your body because both are painfully stupid. Thanks for your time. I hope you found this review helpful.
4,I liked it!,Damon is great in this movie. He seems to play very witty types of roles. This is one of them.
4,"""Talented"" cast of ""Mr. Ripley""","I'm actually really not sure whether I liked this movie or not. Some parts were funny, some were suspenseful, some were weird and other parts were just plain boring. One thing I know I did like were the characters. I found Jude Law's character Dickie to be really interesting. I mean why did he just take this guy in who he didn't even know and how he continued being best friends with him without even knowing who he really is. Also Phillip Seymour Hoffman is great again at what he does best. Really interesting supporting roles. I like him in small roles like this and Magnolia and Boogie Nights, but I can't stand him in entire movies like Flawless. He can annoy me after a while. Matt Damon was obviously good too, but the supporting is what makes the main character and story better. Just at least rent this one for an intersting and twisted story."
3,OK to Occupy Your Time,"The movie takes its sweet time in getting to the point. There's lush scenery, but the story falters. Maybe this is because Damon is not that belivable in his role. I would not buy it, but I would rent it for the Italian landscape."
3,Still trying to get it.,"Don't get me wrong I got the story, but the one ? I have is why. Why is this man making it his life to be someone else. The story just went on and on. From one lover to the next. I was surprised that he never got caught. Got close, but no luck, because I really wanted him to get caught, because he thought he was good. Matt Damon did a good job of acting and so did Gwenth Palthrow (excuse the spelling). The set was boring and the town was dull. But if you like crazy movies that make you say Huh! Then you will enjoy this movie."
3,Enjoyable....but,The movie did run too long and could have ended several times without impacting the plot which had become pretty humdrum during the last 1/3 of the film. Even psychopath's deserve some character development but we just get a continuous flood of Ripley feeling bad about himself after establishing his psycho credentials early on and then having to kill someone - so the movie wasnt very clever about this - but overall was a fun film too watch.
4,The Talented Mr. Ripley,Ok - The plot is deep. This is a well-thought thriller and could have been far more successful than it was...with a few alterations. Jude Law & Gwenyth Paltrow shine (as ever) Philip-Seymour...whoever also played a good part as the slightly freakish friend of Law's character. The big let down was Matt Damon - Now I am not a fan of his...I think someone else should have been cast in his place as for me Damon has no sparkle in films whatsoever. Blanchett was wasted in her role - for such a high profile actress it was a shame not to see that much of her (especially after watching her light up Elizabeth!).Overall this is definately worth watching - if you like well-thought thrillers with real depth then this is for you...if on the other hand you like shallow flicks then I would advise you don't watch.
4,Good,"This is a tight thriller. Matt Damon once again proves that he can act and is no real fluke. So does Gwyneth Paltrow. On top of that you have a cast rounded out by Jude Law and Philip Seymore Hoffman, and excellent directing by Anthony Minghella."
3,"Not only talented, also demented Mr. Ripley","A psychological thriller that has a great climax but the ending is usatisfactory. I admit, I never read the book, but I can only bet the book had a better ending, usually does. Matt Damon gives an amazing performance as the lead, Tom Ripley. What makes Mr. Ripley so talented his natural ability to learn about people, so well, that he can copycat their voices and looks. So, when he meets Jude Law's character, Dickie Greenleaf, he would like nothing else than to live life as he does. Mr. Ripley will stop at nothing to obtain that kind of life. The only one who realizes Ripley is up to no good is Paltrow, who plays Jude Law's wife. Others who find out, end up silenced, if you know what I mean. While the story builds and builds to a well done climax, it fails to resolve the story at the end. GRADE: C"
3,Split personality--or no personality?,"I like good psychodramas, and this is one of the few I've seen that's even remotely accurate in the psychological aspect. Beyond that, I thought it was a very well done film. I will admit, I'm not a big Paltrow fan--but Jude Law, especially, was fantastic."
1,Cool title; wasted on a horrible movie!!,"This movie was HORRIBLE!! You know when you sit thru a movie waiting for something... anything to happen... well, you'll be waiting a LONG time w/this movie. I was HIGHLY disappointed! Matt Damon was spectacular as usual. The man has a million faces and emotions.... brilliant. However, why he chose to do a piece of trash movie as this is beyond me. Oh and as a shocker <a touch of sarcasm there> Gwenyth Paltrow played a nieve, fragile, ""so-called"" victim. PLEASE!!!! How virtuous can one be in a scummy, sadistic, twisted plot. Moreover... this movie lacked humor, action, drama, dynamics, characters w/depth and basically a plot. HOW did this flick get made???? Every time I here the name ripley I shutter... what a waste of TIME!!! I wish someone would have warned me before I sat down and wasted 120 minutes of my life... which consequently felt like an eternity!!"
2,Too Long and Too Uppity,"What do you get when you cross a Merchant and Ivory Film with the typical hollywood serial killer flick? You get the Talented Mr. Ripley. The two do not mix well.Filled with great actors and wonderful scenery the film is too long and too talky. I think they tried very hard to make a ""sophisticated"" thriller and I they DID NOT pull it off successfully.Interesting at times, the film is ultimately too long with long streches of no real action.The DVD has some cool extra features but in the end I do not recommend owning this one. It is worth a rental if nothing else is in, but certainly not worth buying and watching again."
3,So So,This movie did not get grate reviews but it was still high up there. I was suprised this movie was not very good at all. It seemed like the acting was the only good thing about it but the story and the plot was just a big joke. I say you can pass this movie up you wont be missing a thing.
2,Pretty Average,"I Didn't get the Fuss over this Picture.I Just Rented it&I Didn't get what The 50's,Jazz,Italy,Homosexuality,etc.. had to do with this Picture.I watched this Film&I Discovered that they Showed a Miles Davis Album Called Tutu that was Released in 1986 not the 50's? also a John Coltrane Album that was Put out in the 60's.but the film Ended so Fake.Nobody put Matt Damon as The Killer.it was Too Slick&Shallow.Gwyneth Paltrow was alright but nothing Special.this Film lacked Tension it was Boring from the middle to the End.Will Smith's 6 degree's of Seperation was far more COnvincing than this Film."
4,Interesting,"I really didn't know what the make of this movie; so, I gave it a 4. Simlpy for the fact, that it was interesting to see Matt Damon play such a dark role."
4,Great Movie,Really enjoyed this movie. I had seen it years ago but wanted to see if it stood the test of time. It did. To watch the decline of Matt Damon's character is wonderful.
4,Matt Damon keeps you guessing,"Who's the good guy and who's the bad guy in this film? It's hard to tell at first. Dickie (Jude Law) is the wild child in the first half, while Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) seems like a nerd. It's at half-time that Dickie calls Tom ""boring"" and drops off screen, and we're left with the impression that the movie is going to drag through the 2nd half. But it's not true -- the 2nd half of the movie is the real thriller, and it flies by. We ought to know better - most of us have followed Matt Damon through Bourne after Bourne and never got bored. I wasn't too thrilled with the ending though - would have liked something a little more cheery. It sets Ripley up for his coming career, in films such as Ripley's Game (starring John Malkovich) in which he's completely polished up his fiendish act. Both films are based on a book series, but I just recently found out about this, to my surprise. ""Talented"" is an interesting if uneasy introduction to this disturbing character."
5,"Great cast, beautiful location = one fantastic film!",I absolutely love the acting in this film and the location is a feast for the eyes! This is a good watch anytime!
2,The Talantless Mr Ripley,"I have to admit I was looking forward to this movie from the previews. The idea of someone taking over another person's life is an interesting premise. Too bad this movie wastes it completely. Mr. Ripley is as Dickie so elegently explains: is boring. His character is unlikable and not too smart. During the entire second half of the movies, I kept expecting his lies to indict him but no one (except Maude) ever figure out his crimes. The ending is completly anti-climatic, it never explains Ripley's motives and is a completly senseless murder. Why is it all these 'culturally signifgant films' seem toi be set in Europe and filled of vapid characters?"
4,"Yes, he's the great pretender!","Writer-director Anthony Minghella (""The English Patient"") builds the suspense slowly and stealthily in his handsome adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's classic thriller. Set in the most picturesque parts of Italy during the late 1950s, the movie focuses on Tom Ripley (Matt Damon), a resourceful young American who's hired by a wealthy New York shipbuilder to bring the older man's playboy son (Jude Law) back to America. Unfortunately, the son doesn't want to go home. Even more unfortunately, neither does Ripley. As an ingratiating nobody who becomes dangerously addicted to lifestyles of the rich and fatuous, Damon somehow manages to remain sympathetic even when he behaves like a sociopath. Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett make the most of secondary roles, while Jude Law (""Gattica,"" ""Wilde"") makes a serious bid for stardom with his breakthrough performance as a fatally careless voluptuary."
3,Nothing compared to the Original!,"Its an old story based on Patricia Highsmiths Novel, with some nice pictures and a good Soundtrack but not as good actors as in the original! Matt Damon is a good actor but he could never reach Allain Delon thats for sure!Mr.Ripley job is to bring Dicki from Itally back to America, Ripley kills Dicki and takes his Identification than the real trubble beginn! At least Ms.Paltrow played well for the first time! Its a quit good movie with beautifull pictures!"
1,Ugh,"What a horrible movie! I can believe Matt Damon was in this. There were only a few elements which were tolerable, the rest was pure garbage."
2,This is NOT suspense!,"I prefer to call this movie The Boring Mr. Ripley, because it certainly is. Beautifully filmed, aptly acted, long? Yes! Suspenseful (as claimed)? NO! This movie is 2.5 hours that seems to drag on for 5 hours. Thomas Ripley is about as threatening and imposing as my niece. But to each his own I guess."
4,"Like it or not, it is well-made","In a way, I liked it. A careful elaboration of the character of an accomplished evil, an exploration how deep the vice and the greed can lead."
3,The Talented Mr. Ripley,"It's as suffocating as it is breathtaking. The direction is tight and enchanting; it's as if Minghella were filming each shot to make up an artsy slide show about his vacation to Italy. Damon plays a psychotic so realistically that he forgets he's an actor playing a part... It's almost too convincing, and there's no room in the script to compensate for it. It's not a bad movie, it can't possibly be -- everything is handled so meticulously and obsessively that it would score perfectly on an aesthetics exam -- but it ends of draining the film of some of it's mystery. Jude Law, Phillip-Seymore Hoffman, and Gwyneth Paltrow all give the performance of their careers. And pay close attention to the scenes inside a night club, it's a true triumph in contemporary cinema."
2,"Bloated, meandering and overall boring","Two stars only for the perfect pitch casting. Because space is limited, let me just toss out the most egregious elements of the movie:* God this movie was long;* no Americans except people who think movies are art (these are the people who drink espresso and hold the semi demitasse cups with a thumb and index finger) care to see a movie about class tensions;* the protagonist should not be markedly stupider than the audience. Anyone who wasn't yelling ""Get the hell out of Rome"" after Tom runs into Meredith is probably dumb enough to think this is a great movie;* Exactly why should the movie end after Tom's third murder, as opposed to the second, or even the first? There's no rhyme or reason to that particular place to end the movie."
5,One of Patricia Highsmith's Best,One of my favorite films. You will find no redemption for TomRipley in this film which allows a range of acting that knows no boundry.Ripley always wins...or does he>See all the Ripley series on DVD!
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though Matt Damon's Tom Ripley is not nearly as interesting as every other actor/character around him, the movie succeeds in being interesting for 135 minutes and is a worthy thriller."
5,Amazing performances,"One of my favorite movies. Matt Damon's performance is perfect, Jude Law is wonderful and Gwyneth Paltrow is luminescent. It is mysterious, haunting, and thought provoking. The acting is intense and masterful and you cannot help but be drawn into the story. The complex layers of the characters are slowly revealed and wonderfully portrayed."
4,"Dillon or DiCaprio, not Damon","A great movie - taut screenplay, astounding cinematography. The beauty of Mediterranean Europe & the period have been captured beautifully. Jude Law is amazing. He is so expressive... every look, every gesture!If there is a flaw, I think it is Matt Damon. A little too wooden for my liking. Matt Dillon would have been a better choice as the sinister Mr. Ripley. Or Leonardo DiCaprio. But still, a great film."
2,Confused,"The director (who is also the screenwriter, so he gets all the blame) has sanitized Ripley to make him more ""sympathetic."" Tom Ripley is only interesting when he is not sympathetic! The whole homoeroticism was wayyyyyy overplayed in the media; there's nothing here that will make a literate, half-sophisticated person sit up and be shocked or even intrigued. Put Matt Damon in an ................. scene and THEN you have him really trashing his All-American image. The movie completely lost me when Tom supposedly kills Dickie out of frustrated ""love"" and then in the next scene has him coldly trying to pass himself off as Dickie. Apparently the novel has Tom killing Dickie in cold blood; now THAT would be more interesting. In terms of acting, Gwyneth Paltrow was annoying. Only Cate Blanchett I got excited to seeing whenever she came on screen. I think Minghella needs to stop making these bloated, cinematography-driven allegories and focus on character, character, character."
2,"Stylish, but predictible and slowly paced.","This film was one of those on the list of movies I SHOULD like. However, I found the pace of the film slow and plodding and the story less than intriguing. I was not surprised by any plot twist or supposedly ""hidden"" motive. I disliked all the characters and thus had no one to identify with. I was yawning all the way through - and THIS review is coming from someone who LOVED ""My Dinner with Andre."""
1,Wasted Talent,"I'm usually a fan of Matt Damon's, but this movie goes beyond his ability to help. This movie has nothing enjoyable in it. It is just a closet manic-depressive bordering on psychotic committing crimes of necessity to continually cover up his crime of passion. At no point does the movie throw any real twists or interest in. I suppose it is somewhat of a decent commentary on how even a seemingly normal person can become a monstrosity of conscience, but as that it is well beyond my generous capability to enjoy.Read Crime and Punishment if you want a story that really explores the depths of the dark side of human nature. I didn't enjoy that one either, but at least it was intelligent. This just gives you the darkness without the psychological exploration."
1,WHat movie did you guys watch?,"So many positive reviews for this film. it was one of the worstmovies I have ever had the displeasure of seeing, Matt Damon ... did an ok acting job. thats as far as the positives goes.. The plot is just ridulas everyone else looked more like fools trying to act. by the way did I mention how Horribal that Plot was.. Normally I'd say rent this movie before buying it, But dont even bother, its not worth the 4 bucks for one viewing let alone multiple ones."
1,A shocker in more ways than one,"I was expecting Matt Daman to be a bit more like he was in ""Private Ryan"". However, if you are expecting to find out anything about Mr.Ripley that is incredible, I can save you a few Dollars. Unless you are of this flavor Mr. Ripley is a talented, psychopathic, homosexual murderer. I wish that was on the back of the box when I purchased this movie. With no offense intended against this particular community it would be nice if they would inform us before we spend the long drawn out moments trying to endure to the end ont this film."
4,A Tale of Change,"This is a wonderful story of a strange salvation of a young man who seeks one thing: himself. I loved the movie...it has just enough suspense to keep your eyes glued to the movie while Ripley weaves his genius plan in and out of the plot. You get a sense that Tom and Dickie were just somehow cosmically meant to be together, yet in the end Tom must find his own way. Tom is left with a dilemma of massive proportions...he must deal with the police, two separate identities, the press, and countless numbers of others who are after him. You get a sense that he is just doing only what he knows how to do...protect himself. In the end though, you get a feeling that Tom just gives up...and that giving up is what finally I believe sets him free. Perhaps the real Tom is just beginning to live his life as the movie closes with Tom sitting, staring, and just thinking."
3,So-So (minor spoilers),"I have to say... this movie was... er... interesting. The movie started off great... and continued to be great until... oh... say... 2/3 of the way into the movie, where the movie started self-destructing. Not to mention the horribly ambiguous ending... Not to mention many questions left unanswered... (I.E. What happened to Tom? Why the hell was Cate Blanchett's character even IN the movie? etc.) The performances were great, and Italy looked beautiful... but there's still something missing.... like an actual ENDING?"
1,Two hours of my life I'll never get back!,I watached this movie with three other people and at the end the verdict was unanimous - it was awful! If you are looking for a suspense packed thriller of a movie - keep on looking. This is definitely not it. I was hugely disappointed. While the plot definitely kept you waiting for something to happen - it never did! You get to the end wondering what in heaven's name was the point. It was a big let down!
3,JUDE LAW STEALS EVERY SCENE HE`S IN,This i s over-the-top and on the stupid side. The plot and the gaytheme never reach catharisis; it`s only helped by the Italian landscape and the ever impressive Jude Law...
1,Horrible beyond words.,"I hated it, simply hated it. It was one of those experiences where you just keep asking yourself when it's going to be over.This movie is billed as a thriller. But what is thrilling about it? The pace is excruciatingly slow and Damon's acting is so dead-pan as to be painful. Is there a likable character in this whole tedious story? Perhaps Paltrow's character is, but you see so little of her that the movie is beyond her saving.Who cares who gets killed or whether he gets away with it? You feel nothing for any one of these characters, hoping beyond hope that the killing is swift and the credits begin. And when they finally come there are so many unanswered questions that you wonder what the point was to suffering to the end of this miserable film. This goes on my list of all-time worst movies."
1,Good idea - poor implementation...,"This movie excited me very much from what few glimpses we were given as previews - so I rushed to see it, and was thoroughly disappointed. The premise is great - a very original entertaining idea - a star is earned here, and that's it. This movie dragged on and on and on... Nothing was resolved or accomplished at all. Sure it had nice scenery, but I don't watch movies for the scenery, I watch them for plots and entertainment - and this movie unfortunately had neither. I highly recommend it be avoided..."
5,Great Movie!,I've seen this movie a bunch of times... One of my very favorites and I highly recommend it. Matt Damon is great!
5,Talented Mr Ripley,"Love this movie. it's great seeing Matt Damon, Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow again in this beautifullyset movie. Arrived in good shape and in a very timely manner."
5,A Different Slant,"The DVD of The Talented Mr. Ripley works as well on small sreen as the spacious film did in the theaters. Somehow the character development seems more fleshed out, probably due to the fact that the Theater version lavished us with the visual wonders of Italy. But here we are allowed inside the minds of each of the sterling cast of five: Minghella has drawn both individual moments and fine ensemble acting from Damon, Law, Palltrow, Blanchett and Hoffman. The music score is mesmerizing and assists in seducing us into fallling in love with people who share their evil side while masking their whole being beneath the facade of The Upper Class. I think the reason Tom Ripley wins us over inspite of his deeds is the fact that he is trying so hard to capture ""The American Dream""...and all the shallowness that can at times represent. Worth owning."
4,Mini vacation,"I have seen this movie twice before buying it and when I need a mini vacation from daily life, the colors and sights transport you to another place and time--like leaving your living room without actually leaving it."
1,ugh and copy cat,"I heard so many good reviews I went to see this movie. I was sick. If anybody likes this movie, they should check with psychologist.It is one of those:""tell me if you like this movie, and I will tell you what kind of person you are.""The worst was that I found the same movie in foreign section--Made in Italy. So on the top of it, it was just copied."
4,Mr. Ripley is insane!,"I recommend The Talented Mr. Ripley to those Matt Damon fans all over the world. Matt does a wonderful job as Mr. Ripley making him as evil and mischevious as he was in the novel. Matt bring Mr. Ripley to life as soon as the first brudal muder is commited. This movie is definatly one of the best thrillers ever. The story is great, but gets a little confusing at times. Pay attention and keep focus, and you will enjoy it as much as I did."
4,Certainly worth buying,"What differs this movie from the others is that Mr.Ripley is an anti-hero, though you want him to win. I think this movie will be something different for those, who are tired of watching Mr.nice guys all the time. I have read the book years ago and and I think it is a very good adaptation but could have also been better. That's why I rated it with 4 stars whereas i'd rate the book with 5. The acting by Matt Damon is also very impressive, he is just like the Ripley I had in mind as i was reading the book. I hope they also shoot the other Ripley books soon."
4,TU VUO' FA L'AMERICANO!!,"A magnificient film with great music!! Anthony Minghella is a visual master and one of the best adapters of fiction today. His adaptations are great because he isn't afraid to add new things to the original. Even if you've read the original material you are still surprised by the plot turns. There is some great acting as well by Jude Law, Matt DAmon, Gweneth Paltrow, and Cate Blanchette. And Tu Vuo' Fa L'Americano is one catchy tune!!"
1,It has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen!,If you like a movie which has no story line and drags on for ages then this is the film for you. Honestly I have to say it was the longest 2 and half hours i have spent watching a film. All it is about is a young boy who wants to be something he's not. He will willingly kill to get what he wants and thats about it. Exciting? no way!
1,see and compare,"Have you seen the version of this film played by Alain Delon (in the role of Mr. Ripley)? Do and compare. Matt Damon may be good at plain tear jerkers, but he is incapable of playing a psychologically multilayered character."
2,Good acting/BAD movie,"The acting in this movie is very good, but thats all you can say about it. The movie does drag a bit and as another reviewer said you don't care if the characters get killed or not. The ending has to be one of the worst I've seen in years."
3,UNNECESSARY REMAKE,"The 1960 FRENCH movie with ALAIN DELON was perhaps not perfect,but it had a great atmospheric feeling to it.This remake simply doesn't ring true ,with MATT DAMON miscast as RIPLEY.The homosexual overtones in PATRICIA HIGHSMITH's novels were often disturbing in her time.The ITALIAN locations are obviously nice to look at,but can carry a movie by itself.Don't waste your precious time watching this pretentious movie.If you want to hear MY FUNNY VALENTINE,buy FRANK SINATRA's SONGS FOR YOUNG LOVERS-SWING EASY.When are they going to stop making those unnecessary remakes that HOLLYWOOD is so fond of between more important projects?"
2,Neverending movie,"I must agree with another reviewer in saying, ""I couldn't wait for it to end."" While I liked Jude Law in the role of Dickie, once he gets axed the movie begins to plunge past the level of mediocrity and keeps going until the end. Honestly, I didn't find Matt Damon's performances subtle -- I don't fault him as an actor, I just think the role wasn't really suited for him, not to mention there really wasn't anything compelling about the character to begin with. Not only is the movie needlessly long, it is in fact painfully long. The only reason I watched it to the end is because I figured -- ""ok it has to be over soon"" (this went on for at least an hour). By the end I didn't care if Ripley was caught or not, confessed, went on a bloody rampage, or moved to Kentucky, as long as it happened soon so that the movie would finally be over."
2,Not good.,"I just finished reading this book and really enjoyed it. I dashed out to rent this DVD and had to stop halfway through for the sheer irritation of it all. I finished it this morningI didn't like this movie for two reasons. The gay card was used too fast and sends a odd message. Ripley's character is more complex and making repressed homosexuality the motive for his actions is slow pitch. It's an easy solution and dumbs him down. I'm not comfortable with the message it sends of gays being psychotics and murderers. Oh well, that's Hollywood.The acting was over the top. It's too ham fisted and the actors were cast more for their star power instead of their actual acting ability. Oh well, that's Hollywood.Rent this movie if you must but do not buy it. Read the book. Patricia Highsmith is a great writer and this movie doesn't do her justice. I think I just made a pun."
2,Not So Talented Adaptation,A meandering wandering venture that transforms Ms. Highsmith's novel into a homosexual parady. See Ripley's Game for the proper feel of the character Ms. Highsmith created. A disappointing movie cursed by a bad screenplay and a waste of so many talented actors.
3,"Well made, but........","The complex issue of identity is a good place to start a screenplay. Everyone trying to be someone else is an interesting human trait, but.... As Mr. Ripley attempts to become someone else I found that I didn't especially feel any empathy for his character, nor did I feel any for any of the others! As people start dying, it was no big deal because I didn't care for their characters any more than Ripley! As the movie progressed it had already made its point early on and the last 45 minutes seemed like hours. This is a beautifully filmed effort, but if you don't care about the characters and their plight, then the movie ultimately fails. The screenplay, it seems to me, is extremely and falsely praised by critics."
1,An exploration into the pathetic,"Although the acting is good, the premise is utterly despicable. Why would I want to watch a movie about a character with no redeeming values? Just to elevate myself? It's hard to believe that Ripley was a popular enough character to garner five books and multiple movies. Jude Law and Matt Damon were excellent actors but I could never get over the poor storyline. I would definitely not recommend."
2,the not so talented mr. ripley,"Good looking film reminescent of the fifties and sixties films when budgets allowed for exotic location shooting. It takes much too long to get to the spice ultimately what could have been a very good film comes away as just okay. the scene in the jazz bar is a direct ripoff of the scene with the really wonderful ""It started in Naples"" with the wonderful sophia loren and clark gable funny i havent heard anyone mention that. Paltrow gets a little too sickening trying to locate her beau jude law who gets off teasing damon."
2,Read the book instead!,"This movie was such a poor adaption of Patricia Highsmith's fine and chilling novel, that it's laughable! The characters in the screenplay have none of the complexities in the novel; rather, they are all two dimensional, shallow and boring. I found that I did not care what happened to these characters, where I couldn't put the book down. The reason I gave it two stars, rather than one was because the filming was beautiful. Take my advice, spend the money on the novel, don't waste it on this film!"
3,Boring but somewhat interesting film,"I literally fell asleep the first time I tried watching this DVD. It has some interesting aspects to it, but overall it reminded me of the Spanish Prisoner without any of the mystery that made that bad movie almost good.The Director's commentary contains much too much droning on and on about the story, where he explains, TELLS you the story you have just seen. I prefer commentary that gives me the story BEHIND the story - there is some discussion about filming difficulties at the Spanish Steps for example, but not enough. I still wonder how they got that long shot of an empty Via Veneto for example (I suppose it was touched up by computer)."
5,"Don't let the art fool you, this one's a keeper!","Perhaps one of the best manga series out there overall. The artwork may put a few off, but once you get past that, it's such a witty and intelligent read. You find yourself laughing with the characters and wondering what they'll do next.Mind you, the worse volume out of the series is vol. 1, but once you get past it, it's ALL goldmine after that."
3,Wasn't a fave but still good.,"I didn't really enjoy this Manga Series though I bought it. It was sweet and funny but didn't float my boat. The art is one thing that always throws me off - and believe me if your the same don't go for this book. The main character looks to much like a chick for my liking but still he always seems to prove he is male. The only 'older' Shonen Ai - Yaoi Manga I go for is Kizuna. Trust me, go for Kizuna. But it's totally your decision."
4,Great working with John Lennon + David Peel,"You see back in the summer of 1971 is when it all begin ,I was with my friend Tommy Doyle, Billy Mineli and myself Frank (Lance) Lanci. We were doing sessions for The Pope Smokes Dope when in Dec. 1971 John Lennon became the producer and started recording at Record Plant in NYC. Well David and John hit it off , and turned some heads around with the content of the record I guess thats why it took over 35 years to become somewhat avaiable. So as you listen to it think of the ground breaking impact it could have had if it was not banned , and also the demand for a copy in the future. By the way we had a great time making this record that includes David,John+Yoko."
5,Wonderful book - highly recommend it!,"This book is very beautiful and if you like these little earth creatures you are definitively in for a treat! This book is read almost every day at our house; besides ""Pico the Gnome"" this is our favorite gnome book! I wish there would be more books like this one out there!The illustrations are just lovely and the poems are met with giggles every time we read them...and not just from the children!A definite must have on your bookshelf if you like to engage your child's imagination."
5,Inspirational,"This probably is the most profound recorded material I have heard.Although it's themed in Africa, its messages relate to everyone, everywhere. I can't describe this work in a way that would do it justice, except to say Ms. Mortifee makes a superb statement, in terms of musicality, poetry and a spiritual message that takes root in the heart."
4,The Rich Sound of Ann Mortifee,"I've been a fan of Ann Mortifee for 30 years. Her voice weaves a rich tapestry of African sound and culture. While some of the tracks are duplicated on other albums, I've found it very enjoyable."
4,"A riveting, poignant story !","The novel written by Ms. Marlowe was more unpredictable than I expected when I first started reading it. You never know what the heroine, who was brought to Montana from the city to bail her sister out of jail. Her sister served a 10 day sentence, and she herself was sentenced to ""do time"" with the owner of a ranch at his ranch. What goes from there will surprise you."
4,Handy with An Ugly Cord,"We purchased this item approximately one month ago. It is our first toaster oven. All features perform as promised. You need to fine tune the toasting selection to your liking. It took a few trial and errors to stop burning/under cooking frozen waffles. I like the cool exterior for safety reasons. I debated purchasing this unit versus the Cuisinart. This unit has a front crumb tray. Cuisinart has back loading tray and no cool exterior. I cannot imagine how troublesome it would be to take out crumb tray from back, as I do this daily to clean up from messy teenagers. The only thing I hate is the darn ugly cord that comes with this unit. One would think that a white appliance would have a WHITE cord but this cord is one ugly black snake that I had to work very hard to hide on my white countertop. Regardless, I am still happy with our purchase."
5,Preserving the Past From the Vandals of History,"See my review in the National Catholic Reporter of May 20, 2005:http://www.natcath.com/NCR_Online/archives2/2005b/052005/052005ssg.php"
1,Never Got This Item,"I'm not sure how to rate Eidolon's ""Coma Nation"" album, since I never got this item. I bought it on November 1st and it was supposed to arrived after November 28. I contacted the seller and even gave my address in an email to them. I won't ever purchase anything else from this seller again."
4,In the art of metal,"This guys have a lot of great melodies, i can be sure that if you buy this album won't be disapointed.The openin trak ""nemesis"" is a very beautiful guitar based instrumental song. Then after the agresion of a Thrash/power metal band comes into scene. Track after track the bands take you into a world of darkness and pain, but this album is not a concept album, reason why that is so brilliant every song is a him to melancholy and sadness or even strenght and courage to live.This album has everything you would want in a good metal album, exelent musicianship and anger, pain, sadness and hope.Don't think it to much it worth the money."
3,Review of The Diversity Of Life,"The Diversity Of Life is a very interesting book. The author, Edward O. Wilson, discusses many different aspects of diversity in the world. He gives many examples from microbacteria to the wather around the world. Wilson argues against destruction of rainforests and proposes more scientists to discover more species in the world. And Wilson talks about how without human destruction in nature, nature can recover from destruction on her own. Wilson wants to save all organisms on Earth and wants to perserve nature as it should be."
3,The Diversity of Life,"To begin with, I would like to say that this book was fairly good. The book started talking about early life on this planet, the various pioneering species of early Earth, etc. The book then goes into detail about the eolutionary paths of some of these pioneer species and of evolution in general, and of how the biodiversity on Earth has grown both in size and complexity. Towards the end, the book goes into the human influence on the environment; mostly the negative effects of human activity on theenvironment. I read this book for an AP Environmental Science class, and although this book is not the best, it had many colorful graphics and was fairly interesting and not dull like many of the books you are forced to read in school."
2,The Diversity of Life,"Although this book was well written, with sophisticated language, it was quite dry. It greatly resembled a biology textbook, which causes the reader to lose interest. A lot of imagery and vivid description was used, to help depict the theme of the novel. The book explores the many diverse organisms prevalent in the world, as well as the ones that were presend throughout the course of history. Wilson starts his adventure off in the Amazon River Basin, where he encounters many not widely known species. He explains throughout the novel, the importance of the diversity of life, as well as how nataural disasters do not neccesarily harm diversity. This book is recommended to those who enjoy biology, and would like to explore the theories and examples of biological concepts."
1,Did we read the same book?,"I hated this ""book"" more than most. Firstly, I thought it was a whole lot of examples prooving very few points, like a bad essay. He also seemed to rely on his cumbersome vocabulary as a way of asserting his role as the knowledgeable professor; who does he think he impresses? The value of his words ought to be enough, though he doesn't seem to know this. A writer he is not, and it takes one to be a mainstream author. Also, his biases towards his and Darwin's work was sheer denial of the opposing facts. Even worse, his prejudice on the Leaver tribes in the places he stayed at was ghastly. The whole thing made me retch. Why would anyone read this out of free will? The people who think they enjoyed it probably didn't understand it!"
4,"Well Written, and Informative","The book's strongest point, in my opinion, is its ease of reading. Wilson doesn't try to impress you with overly sophisticated vocabulary, or complex passages that only college professors can comprehend. Instead, he chooses to represent the material in an easy to follow, easy to understand format. He covers a wide variety of topics, from geology to evolution, and brilliantly ties them together to give you a thorough understanding of how diversity amongst organisms came about. A great buy, you certainly will not be disappointed!"
5,Beautiful little table.,"The table is dark brown, well made, very sturdy. I love the little drawer. It was easy to assemble and arrived in perfect shape."
1,Ughh! What a hassle to assemble!,"Not as advertised- Poorly made assembly line item imported from China. If it wasn't such a hassle to send back, I would have. Buy Gorilla Wood Glue as the funky screw assembly units for the lower shelf are a trip. I eventually got this hunk of junk put together properly but not without the help of the glue I mentioned and a few bungee cords to act as clamps holding the legs tightly together. I would recommend you find a better table and avoid this one."
4,Really nice Cherry finish and a cheap but nice piece of furniture,"Easy to Assemble. Flimsy? A bit. Problems with the dowel and the drawer described by other reviewers? Not really. Maybe overpriced. Put it this way: it is a really cheap piece of furniture, but it does not LOOK that way. It actually looks great and with both a shelf and a drawer I don't think you can find one like it - certainly not for the price. We're pretty darn happy with it. Now we just need other stuff to go with it to match. We used it for a Halloween pumpkin and candy and put it outside - did great."
1,terrible instructions wrecked product,"The table comes dissassembled: no problem, if you can decode the impossible to follow 2-step instructions for a 10 step process, AND if you have the power tools needed to drive screws into holes that are bored too small for the screws. Within 15 minutes of attempting to assemble this table I had ruined it. Shoddy instructions. You get what you pay for!"
5,A Mirror of This World,"Eerie is one way to describe this marvel of a book. The suspense of Jake coming over to Rolands world kept me turning the page night after night. The plaster man in the haunted mansion was so realistic,I could have been there reaching for the key to open the door to the other side. I cannot wait for number 4 so I can see how their fates are sealed. All in all an excellent book. I would highly recommend it for all you thrill seekers out there"
2,And the series hits a wall..,"My girlfriend got me hooked on this series about a year ago, soon after I had finished trekking through the Harry Potter series. The first book, I finished within 2 or 3 days and loved it, it was fresh and flowed beautifully. The second I enjoyed as much, if not more. However, I'm nearly the end of this one (it's been over a year since I started it) and it's taking every ounce of concentration just to keep up with the story and push through it. I feel the ideas for this book were lacking and Stephen King was pooling from a very short list of ideas. My advice to anyone new to the series, be prepared for a droning and hard to read book."
5,Many stories all in one book,"In the third book of the Dark Tower series, King takes you through many different journeys. You will meet the large Shardik the bear, make friends with the old people, venture into the ruins of the city of Lud, meet Gasher (an extremely repulsive individual) and ride on the eerie mono called Blaine. An excited adventure for sure. This is one my favorite series and this book is the best out of this series in my opinion."
3,Great book - terrible Kindle formatting.,"This is a great book, part of a great series. The Dark Tower story begins to crystallize in this volume.But...The Kindle formatting is atrocious. Random misplaced punctuation, mis-spellings, and even random letters inserted in the text are becoming infuriating. They take the reader out of the story. It gets worse as the book progresses. And on top of this, it is the only book in the series that does not include the original illustrations. Someone seriously half-assed this Kindle edition. We deserve a new, corrected version, and this book deserves to be done right."
3,not all is wasted,Stories within stories. The city of lud was interesting and blaine was a pain. A story of how the old folk believed in the gentrified gunslinger set a background
4,First half - 3 stars; second half - 5 stars!,"Yes, Stephen King's epic Dark Tower series is worth continuing, although The Wasteland isn't without shortcomings! King gives us a distinctly different style with each book, and has succeeded thusfar with the exception of the first half of this book. After the cryptic and mysterious Gunslinger and the rip-roaring Drawing of the Three, King hits a little bit of a rut trying to reintroduce Jake, the boy you should recognize from The Gunslinger. The first half is a bit of a drag, plodding through a lot of half-baked, formulaic filler before returning to the real meat of the story - Roland's quest. Fortunately, King makes up for it with a memorable and exciting second half, wherein the weary travelers brave a Mad-Max like post-apocolyptic city with some VERY unfriendly inhabitants. A worthy, if flawed read."
4,I'm in love...,"I fell in love with Roland by the end of The Gunslinger. I read Drawing in 2 days and needed more... The Wastelands was really engrossing, and by then I was completely smitten with Roland..... BUT! If you love the first 3 books, you HAVE to read #4 Wizard and Glass!!! I am obsessed with Roland. However, other than my fantasies of finding a beautiful, strong, and brave gunslinger of my own, the books are a break from straight ""horror"" writing, and offer a deeper perspective on life and the interconnectedness of all things...."
1,Thanks Amazon I'll just type it all out myself.,"I bought your Kindle crap. I'm down with the e-books.FOR A YEAR NOW YOU CAN'T FIX THIS EBOOK/PROVIDE A NEW VERSION?!?Pathetic. It's not like Amazon's exactly a small player in the e-commerce game.Maybe I'll buy a paperback version (somewhere else), then just type the whole damn thing into my Kindle so I can read it conveniently."
3,Blaine the Pain,"After an amazing second book, the Dark Tower Series takes a nose dive back down. The adventure continues, but the action in this book is dismal. We find that Jake returns, finds a friend, gets captured, and then is saved. Blaine the Mono throws out his version of the Hobbit riddles. Then, in the end; wait, there isn't an ending. You know how you hate it when a weekly TV series throws ""To be continued"" on the screen. Well, expect to feel that way at the end of this book."
4,Fun Fun fun!,"This book has the most action of all the books and is super fun! Nothing like mixing together of old west stuff, fantasy stuff and our world. It is greatness."
3,Only Three Stars for Number Three,"This installment of the series is a bit disappointing. In places, the action and plotting seem a bit too much like a comic book, and the character development is a little weak. Roland, Eddie and Susannah don't come off as three-dimensional as in the last book, and the character of Jake has gone from a mysterious, compelling young man to an innocent schoolboy who makes us fear for his safety. The haunted house section was way out of place in this tale, and threw the whole story out of whack. King could have invented a better plot device here. Still, in parts the story is still strong and hypnotic, and I plan to continue along the journey to the Tower."
1,how he became a best selling author is beyond me,"king may have a few good books and movies, the dark tower books are not among them. i have wasted my time and money trying to like them. the more i read the more i would like to punch king in the face."
5,Dark Tower Book 3 on CD,"Very good. I am now on Book 4, which is not as good, but still addictive to continue on through Rolands' journey."
4,3rd of a 7 book series,"If the Drawing of the Three is where the story of the Dark Tower fills out, this book is where it gets teeth. Now that the series is done, the cliffhanger ending isn't so bad, but I'll tell ya, I was pretty put out the first time I read it and then had to wait 4 years for the next installment. Now, though, all seven are finished and you will transition smoothly to the next book."
2,The Waste Lands (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition),"I loved the book! Stephen King is my favorite author of all time but the binding and the size of this edition was uncomfortable to hold while reading and the print was intensely small. I didn't really research what this particular type of binding was and now I wish I had.The story is still great, but next time I will not purchase anything in School and Library binding."
4,I Kill With My Heart,"I do not aim with my hand.He who aims with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.I aim with my Eye.I do not shoot with my hand.He who shoots with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.I shoot with my Mind.I do not kill with my hand.He who kills with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.I kill with my Heart.---------The major thing I don't understand is why in every version of the cover art, Blane is depicted as an old-west style train, when he's a ultramodern monorail in the book? Five star writing quality, but I have to take something off for the incongruity of the artwork."
4,Wastelands,"The first half takes a lot to get through and does not get explained in this book of the story, but eventually does. The second half more than makes up for it though."
5,"Wizard and the Glass, absolutely amazing","This is by far, one of my favorite books I have ever read. The Dark Tower series seems to suck you in and keep you entranced even after they are read. Although this book doesn't seem to go forward in time, I think the insight into his past was exactly what needed to happen. Alain, Susan, and Cuthbert were pleasant additions to this series as was Rhea and the Big Coffin Hunters. This book is definately the kind that can get you into trouble. Late nights, four hour reading marathons, and put-off chores certainly won't win you admiration from friends and family. But trust me, it is most definately worth it. This series changes you somehow and even after weeks of finishing you still find yourself incorporating elements of this book into your everyday life. Thank you Mr. King for many hours of enchantment. ""The Man in Black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed."" Roland, I'll be with you every step of the way."
5,One of the best books of all time,As a fan of the Dark Tower series I've read all the books at least twice. Wastelands I've read 7 times. It is one of my all time favorite books and the best of the dark tower series. It is the breakthrough book in which you really discover Roland's world and its links to ours. It is also a great adventure with SK's excellent character development.
3,Not bad,I just finished my second reading of The Waste lands and it just doesn't engage like it did the first time I read it years ago. I've been heavily into hard sci-fi stuff like Baxter lately and going back to King feels like taking a step back to high-school level reading. I don't say that trying to be snobbish but its just the way it feels.The ideas are still lots of fun though and King still manages to surprise occasionally. It's still worth reading the series if only for those reasons.
4,Cliff Hanger Endiing May Annoy Some,"In this third volume of 'The Dark Tower' series I found the narrative to meander a bit towards the cliff hanger climax. Jake, from 'The Gunslinger'is drawn to Roland, joining Susannah, and Eddie. As they begin to discover how their various lives are linked, their quest draws them to the descimated city of Lud, where he brings the tale to an abrupt halt. Luckily fans won't have to wait to see what happens to the fab four since 'Wizard & Glass'is already published. Still quite intriguing if not as much as the previous book, it still makes for good escapist reading."
3,Stephen King book order,"It took a while for the book to reach me, it seemed like, and when I got it, it didn't look like the ""very good"" quality that was tagged to it. I am now wishing I had looked for and/or purchased a cheaper copy. Even though, I was happy when I finally got the book. It's worn, and looks like something I would be owning anyways. I just am afraid to see what the ""poor"" quality would be like. The items should be tagged correctly with the quality. Other than that, I love the book, and am glad that I bought it...except I got another book for a penny (+$3.99 shipping) and the quality was better. Oh well, still happy with purchase, I guess."
3,Stephen King appears to be running out of ideas...,"After the stunning originality of the first two 'Dark Tower' books, Stephen King appears to be running out of inspiration and ideas. There is nothing new in this book, with regard to characters, plots, or even the background. As a result, he appears to be throwing in lots of cliches borrowed from 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Peter Pan'. In the author's end-note, King basically admits that he didn't know how to end this book, so he just did. The characters in the book also are now basically saying 'Let's get to the Dark Tower so that we can get this tiresome journey over with' - I can't agree with them more."
2,King in the 90's,"King's quality of writing dropped off substantially in the beginning of the nineties, his last great book being Needful Things. None of his later creations can compare in either substance or richness of style to the books he had written in the 70's and 80's - be it Bag of Bones, Gerald's Game, or, for that matter, The Waste Lands. The latter is easily the worst SK book I have read. For the first time I found myself skipping through entire chapters without losing the thread of the narration. The story could be as well fit in a third of the volume. May be a worthy read to the dedicated fans of the Gunslinger series, but definitely not a start for those who want to just familiarize themselves with SK."
3,Least favorite so far,"So far, this is my least favorite of the series. Not bad at all, just lacking some of the interesting things and action that the other have had. It was just kind of slow... maybe just too many pages for the content. I feel like I need a break from the series to read something a little easier before I start again!"
5,Dark Tower Series - Stephen King's BEST!,"I recently read the latest in the series, then decided to read all eight books again. This is the second time I've read them, and am enjoying more than the first time!"
1,Amazon has dropped the ball,"Amazon has skipped book 3 on the kindle. You can get the entire series EXCEPT for book III on your kindle.Very painful to find out at the last minute while on a vacation.The Waste Lands (The Dark Tower, Book 3)"
3,Terrible formatting in the Kindle edition,"March 19 2012 and the Kindle edition is still full of typos, random periods and other formatting errors. If the Kindle book sold for ninety-nine cents, I would be OK, sort of, with this sloppy editing but for $8.99 I expect much more. The Kindle edition is almost unreadable. Very annoying and the errors completely change the flow of the story. Somebody was standing too near the Beam when they proofed the Kindle book.I've read many Kindle books and this. book is by far the worst as. far as these types of. errors go."
3,i still remember waiting....,"The waste lands is the 3rd book in the dark tower series and the main thing i remember was the waiting after finishing it. It ends on a horrible cliffhanger. However, now that the whole series is finished any new readers won't have to wait. It is overall a good book and a good entry in the series but it does tend to drag a bit in the middle. Anyway it's a must read for those trying to reach the end and the Tower."
4,Great service and product!,"My son just loved it, he is a big fan and took this to an actual game. Thank you."
4,Works fine for me,I use this primarily for lug nuts and it has not failed yet. I have had considerable torque on this socket and it has held up well.
5,Outstanding music from rare Spanish and Italian 16th C. harpists,"This is an incredible selection of music which is masterfully presented by Andrew Lawrence-King. Mr. Lawrence-King has selected works from Spanish 16th century harpists and then traces the movement of these influences to Naples and Southern Italy in the works of 5 Italian harpists.Whereas the title refers to Luduvico, all 7 of these harpists were followers of Ludovico, ending with the works of Frescobaldi, a renouned harpists in Rome.The works are superb, complex, meditative, uplifting, and captivating. Andrew Lawrence-King built or had built wooden harps with non-metal strings to try to capture the sound of these original compositions. The effect is fantastic, with a warmth akin to the lute, with none of the metalic twang of some modern orchestral harpists.I have owned this CD for around 15 years and I often pull it out to absorb its radiance one more time."
3,A Little Weak For A Human Drama Album,"I am a long standing H.D. fan and couldn't wait to get my hands on Solemn Sun Setting! After listening to it many times since receiving it (thru Amazon of course) I hate to admit only a few songs touched my soul as so many other H.D. songs have done before. It is a good CD, especially if you admire the truth telling of Human Drama, but alas, it is not one of their best. I highly recommend Songs of Betrayal and thier live CD 14,384 Days Later. Unfortunately, Solemn Sun Setting leaves much to be desired for a true fan."
1,These raw cashews were BAD!,I eat a lot of raw cashews (mainly when I'm trying to diet) and thought I'd save myself some money by ordering these in bulk. Unfortunately they were no good. I read the reviews on Amazon for this item and one person felt the same as I do but another review pawned the first dissapointed review off on the fact that of course raw cashews aren't as good as roasted ones. I'm here to tell you that I know what raw cashews taste like and these were no good!!
1,Stale Nuts,"The cashews were cheap enough and that is what I got. They were stale and mushy, not very crunchy I wouldn't feed them to the birds, hopefully they'll get a quality control person to taste their nuts."
3,ok but not great,seemed to be an odd tasting nut....not just because no salt(I hate salt) my wife did like them...I didnt
1,THIS BOOK SUCKS,"Aight, i got this book not too long ago, and read it in one night, and now i'm going to vent. It's terrible. This woman obviously does NOT know them at all. She has probably never even heard of them. She gives Scott ALL the credit. She gets Bob Clint and Dave mixed up so many times, it's not even funny. Well, I'm done...but i'm just warnin ya...don't waste your mula!!"
1,"Please, do some research!","I found this book very frustrating because the author of this book abiously didn't do her homework. I know this is an unauthorized book, but still, she could have found out more info without much trouble. She made several errors, like Dave and Clint being identical twins. I thought the 8 pages of pictures were very cool, and definatly the high point of the book. I would suggest getting The Moffatts: Backstage Pass-which is authorized whith lots of pictures-instead."
1,Awful............,"Now, I got this booke because it was on the Moffatts and I'm like a crazed fan so ya know.....Anyways, the errors in this book were horrible. Yes it is an unathorized book, but there could have been some research involved. The sentence structure, terrible. This is supposed to be an author writing this, it sure didn't sound like one. If you're a fan, you'll most likely want to get this book, great pictures just bad info."
5,A poignant and powerful tale for all ages,"Set in the prehistoric Southwestern United States circa 900 A.D., Under A Standstill Moon is the novel of a girl born during a ""lucky month""; as she becomes a woman, her good fortune becomes a cruel destiny, as she is forced to leave the village and the man she truly love to be given to the High Priest, Sun Watcher. The magic and power of the Sun Watcher frightens the people of her village; and so a young woman must dig deep inside herself to conquer her fear and take control of her destiny. A poignant and powerful tale for all ages, that draws deeply upon what archaeology tells us today of how the native population in the Southwest once lived."
5,how the Anasazi lived,"Rebeccasreads highly recommends UNDER A STAND STILL MOON as a vivid, lyrical recreation of one girl's coming of age during terrifying times when her people, the mysterious & vanished Anasazi, who have lived on the mesas & plains of America's Southwest for generations, are threatened by their gods & the weather they control.A great read for lovers of pre-history how daily lives once were lived."
2,Sure to win a prize,"Under A Stand Still Moon is one of the very best young adult, historical fiction books that I have read in a long time. The attention to detail and historical accuracy woven into a ""can't put down"" story line is exceptional. Creel deftly captures the lives of the Anasazi civilization during its final days. The reader is at once swept back in time and learns about an America that existed well before 1492. I am sure that this book will find itself in the hands of many middle school students and teachers who want to learn more about this period of history-and read a book that is of the same quality as Scott O'Dell's great novel Island of the Blue Dolphins."
4,I'm not sure if I loved it or hated it; I won't forget it,"This book is haunting. Parts of me want to say it was outrageous, too many ideas that don't fully work, too long, and basically absurd. On the other hand, why didn't I put the book down? Why did I read the whole thing over two days (it takes a longer time than you might expect)? Why can't I stop thinking about the book and the ending? Don't worry, I won't dare reveal the ending. The book has, turns and twists and turns and twists. Some questions are never answered. The book pounds away at the imagery of the shadows it becomes far too much. Still, you read this book and search for ethical answers and find none. I think that confusion and frustration is intentional. So either the book is a work of genius, a mediocore hack job, or something in between. Still, I gave it four stars and you should probably decide for yourself."
3,Mystery or Morality Judgment?,"Mystery or Morality Judgment?I have to say that I liked this book, almost. It had mystery, science fact and fiction intertwined with believable and likable characters. I am not going to sum up the story line as many reviewers before me have done an excellent job. My biggest complaint was the final realization that the author was painting religious people as right winged zealots that commit murder in the name of God. The rest of us, are no more than sum of our biological parts treading a preordained path without the possibility of change. All in all a pretty dismal summation of the human condition. The author shows promise, a little humanity might be helpful, Justin deserved more!"
2,Silly,"Entertaining, but ultimately very silly. The conceit behind this novel is intruiging, but ultimately falls prey to banal and trite ""thriller"" novel concepts. The entirety of the ""Shadow World"" idea is laughable."
2,Plot flaw? Too much dumb luck,"The writing is ok, the premise is interesting. There are one too many coincidences in the book. Even adjusting for that, the book has a fatal flaw which is only apparent near the end. Unfortunately I can't say much more without spoiling the plot.The only way to resolve this flaw is to say that ""sheer dumb luck sometimes happens."" Either that or a loosely tied sequel in which the mistake is discovered. The weakness starts with the DNA sample and ends with finding the serial killer. It becomes just too serendipitious, all for the sake of forcing in the twist in the end.Additionally, the author would have been better off with a more tightly written and ultimately satisfying main plot rather than veering off into subplots and extraneous characters."
5,Stylish and Imaginative,"The playing is stylish and imaginative, the ""clock"" movement is beautifully paced and the balance of instruments is excellent. (Classic CD)"
2,Where is the faith in Faithcare?,This book says it will show you how to care for people from a Biblical perspective. What it truly does is gives you a program of social minsitry that ministers very little to the spiritual needs of individuals. Aleshire wants to convey Christlike principles but I feel that he spends too much time on practicality and not enough on meeting the true need which is spiritual.
3,It's a good tamil movie,"After Mohan (Nagesh) kills his jilted sister's ex-boyfriend, he turns to the blind Major Chandrakanth (Sundarrajan) for sanctuary. But when the major's own policeman son is assigned to the case, will he arrest his own father for harboring a fugitive?... After Mohan (Nagesh) kills his jilted sister's ex-boyfriend, he turns to the blind Major Chandrakanth (Sundarrajan) for sanctuary. But when the major's own policeman son is assigned to the case, will he arrest his own father for harboring a fugitive? Directed by K. Balachander, this compelling tale of trust, loyalty and betrayal also stars Jayalalitha J., A.V.M. Rajan and Muthuraman."
3,Great first 2 films but...,"I loved the first two Angel films but I hated Angel III and felt very cheated Anchor Bay had to make this a 3 pack so we all get suckered into buying the third awful film. I really doubt this 3 pack will be a big seller for Anchor Bay. They should have released the films on their own,at least Angel would have sold very well,and probably Avenging Angel too. The third flick is a complete waste. As for the deleted scenes on the DVD,the audio was lost so it's all subtitles. Nothing really that good either."
4,"Fascinating ideas, but one true jewel...","There's one way to describe Lethem's writing: inventive. Reminiscent of Vonnegut and Philip K. Dick at their best, Lethem's stories are some of the most creative works of fiction you'll ever read. Unfortunately, ""creativity"" doesn't always equal ""entertaining."" While none of the stories in this book will bore you, some of them are kind of pointless. You'll get done reading them, and you'll be like, that's it? There is one story in here that's worth the price of the book alone, though: Vanilla Dunk. If you are a sports fan, buy this book, ignore the other stories, and read this one. It's about a futuristic basketball league in which players can have the skills and playing abilities of all the great players of history. It's one of the best sports stories I've ever read. Outstanding. I could pass on the other stories, though."
3,Not Lethem's best.,"Only a few of the stories are worth the effort - Happy Man, Vanilla Dunk & Sleepy People. Lethem knows how to write but these come across as stories written to fill a publishing commitment rather than ones he really worked on.If you are a Lethem fan, this is OK to fill out a collection. If you haven't read him before, give this one a pass and read ""Gun, with Occasional Music"" instead. Four stars for the goodies, two (at best) for the rest - so three star rating."
1,Charlatan,"I'm sorry, can't understand the hype about Lethem. While I do give him credit for his creativity in crafting imaginary worlds, I think his skill when it comes to using language is underdeveloped. His narrative style is banal and utterly unimaginative. Not everyone with a few novel ideas in his head is necessarily a good writer. Give me William Gibson instead any time."
3,Great writing without much plot,"I loved _Gun with Occasional Music_ and _Amnesia Moon_ but this collection didn't really do it for me. _The Happy Man_ was great, I liked _And Forever, said the Duck_, _Vanilla Dunk_ was fun even though I hate sports. But like another reviewer said, no real conclusions, more like story fragments. His quirky style is great, he just needs more room to develop it."
2,"As a huge Lethem fan, I hated this book","After reading Gun With Occasional Music, Amnesia Moon and Motherless Brooklyn and thoroughly enjoying all 3, I consider myself to be a Lethem fan--DESPITE this book.I have not read any other short stories by Lethem, but I didn't enjoy ANY of the stories in this book. They all start with really interesting and promising (""lethemesque"") premesis and then either go somewhere too wierd in what is apparently an attempt to be provocative, or go nowhere. Each could probably be a great novel if flushed out. Instead, they either gross you out, put you to sleep, or bore you to death."
4,Cain - The Biography of James M. Cain,"Roy Hoopes makes ""Jamie"" Cain come alive. Hedelves into his drinking, womanizing, four marriages,his struggles with writing, money, and health. Stillhe was one of the most successful writers of the ""GoldenAge"" of American Literature (1925-1940). One should readone of his three best-selling novels, ""The Postman AlwaysRings Twice"", ""Double Indemnity"" or ""Mildred Pierce beforetaking on this biography."
3,"3.5 stars--cute, satirical little film","A heart-warming story about friendship where one of the friends would really rather hang out with that guy who beat him up for being gay after they had sex. So, yeah, you might find it depressing instead.I didn't think it was laugh-out-loud funny, but it had a lot of dark, absurd little twists. It gets to a happy ending, but unlike some movies where the happiness seems grafted onto a movie that was going in a much darker direction, this movie holds a convincing mix of hope and resignation throughout. Oh, and it's about 75 minutes--not long enough to get tiresome.Overall, it's a clever satire but definitely not a must-see."
3,Ummmmm....Okay!!!,"Okay so its not like the movie was totally horrible. It just lacked that extra umph that it needed to gain my attention. Its really bad that Will Wheaton is the first actor listed in the movie considering that he appeared in one scene only with limited lines. I dont care if he was friends with the writer/director, he should have played the main male role no matter what. It did have its moments though when I was just on the floor laughing about the lines that they gave these people. The quality is a little ""home movie"" but if your extremely bored and dont mind wasting some time in your life to see this then get the stale popcorn and enjoy."
2,"I love JCO, but this was too difficult","This is not the kind of book you should read when you're tired. It was difficult to follow. There were many characters, and sometimes they were the narrators, sometimes a narrator dealt with them, with little transition or indication. The whole novel is divided into a myriad of vignettes, at times way apart from one another. Also, maybe because i was so frustrated with it, the end is confusing and other than the veiled allusions of catastrophe, i couldn't make too much sense of it."
3,Pretty Good,"After reading the first two blockbusting Steig Larsson books I went in search of anything similar. One of the reviews on the back of Never End said the last 50 pages was the most incredible ever mystery writing blah blah, so I bought it. Let me say that there is no comparison to the phenomenal Larsson books that have taken the world by storm. This book is not in that league but is worth the read. It is a good, dark and sexually creepy mystery."
5,"When you read the last sentence, you can breathe again.","Never End begins slowly. The reader struggles to make a coherent story from the details gathered by the detectives, who are also trying to make sense of confusing clues. As the story continues, however, the pace picks up. It left me breathless at the end. I love the Nordic style of Scandinavian authors."
2,"Indeed, Never End","I've been reading this mystery on and off. It gets on my nerves. It is never ending. I go back and then stop. It is never ending, the same over and over, with no relief. The detectives plod their way along. I am an enthusiastic reader of mysteries from all countries. But swedish mysteries are getting on my nerves; the swedes can't get over their heat or their cold [I am scandinavian, by the way]- and this permeates their writing. I will finish this novel. I have taken a pledge. I kept up to page 100 and it appeared to pick up; but, alas, I put it down only to pick up again and so on and so on - will it ever end!!! And if there is some kind of solution, will I care??? Alas!"
3,Buy this CD cheap,They still have copies at tower online... Pay 3.99 for this instead of the exorbitant rates these people are charging...
4,"Solid, if brief, overview","There are a number of 'Music In Review' DVDs, or similar UK-based rock docs, floating around and I enjoy them all quite a bit. While they were obviously filmed on a low-budget (usually it is live takes, demos or alternate takes that are played as the albums are being discussed) and seem to feature the same cast of UK rock critics (Geoff Barton, Dom Lawson, Malcolm Dome, etc.), I still think they are pretty informative and entertaining. These are not in-depth career overviews but they cover the essential albums (if not all of them) and the critics obviously know their stuff. This is not an band-authorized release but those aren't always truthful anyway, are they?For die-hards, I think this is worth watching."
1,No Defenders Of The Faith Review?,"No Defenders Of The Faith review? What a joke! Defenders is my personal favorite Priest release. Freewheel Burning, Love Bites, The Sentinal... are some of their finest work in the whole catalogue. Defenders is a metal masterpiece from start to finish. The fact every release is mentioned, except Defenders makes this a 1 star rating at best and loses all crediblity for the hardcore Priest fan. Malcome Dome is an idiot! See my Van Halen book review by this dolt.Rock Hard Ride Free"
4,I can't hear my computer any more.,"After replacing my power supply and cpu cooler with units with quieter fans, my video card cooling fan was the noisiest thing in the box.This Zalman cooler keeps my MSI6600GT/AGP video card 5C degrees cooler than the stock cooler. And it's quiet too. Zalman's website has information on whether or not the cooler will fit in your case on your card.Make sure you have all of the old thermal paste off of your ram chips or the sticky taped ram chip heat sinks won't stay on. On my video card I had to apply some of them after I got the main cooler attached. They may fit rather tightly next to the cooler."
5,Exact Replacement,"This product was ordered to replace a 25 year old unit that had finally given up. It arrived promptly, was in good condition and was a direct replacement for the old one. It only took about 15 minutes to install.I would recommend this product to anyone who has the experience to install it or a licensed electrician available."
3,If i could give it 3 1/2 stars i would,"this missy album is very hip-hop. hip-hop the fullest, from the lyrics to the beats. but this album didn't just catch me as her best works. i would say that i have listened to the album all the way through but most times i never get past a certain point, just because the beats aren't really what i like and the intrest isnt' there. i purchased this album because of my great intrest in missy and because of the single 'gossip folks' i don't regret buying this album its just not up to par as i expected. i would say though that if you are a hardcore missy fan cop this album. but even if you aren't you might become one...so i would say get it. big props to missy..."
4,I'm a Missy Fan,"This album is not mind blowing, but I like it. Go to the Floor, Gossip Folks (Luda is the man!!!), Funcky Fresh Dressed, and Slide are some of my favorite cuts."
4,A big fan,"I have been a fan of missys since she first came out with 'supa dupa fly' in '97 and I have all of her cds and most of the work she has done with Tweet, Aaliyah and Trina. I can honestly say that this is the best cd she has done. Her other three cds have been good with usually 3 or 4 stand out tracks and the rest mostly filler showing off her producer Timbalands beats. This cd however you can run start to finish and enjoy the whole thing (except for maybe her speeches in between her songs). A lot of people that I know who havent really been big fans of hers have been running out and buying this cd fast, showing its broad appeal to a lot of different crowds. If you dont have this cd already I would definitely advise you to get it, or download songs like ""slide"" and ""pussycat"" as well as the current singles."
3,Still Under Construction...,"Missy Elliott's albums have always proved successful, as herself and her music grows with the every changing style of urban music. ""Under Construction"", while some believe it lacks in several areas, is acutally an album that takes urban music and crams it all into one 13 track disc. Missy Elliott, not only represents the rap genre, but she also moves into more the R&B style, which can be heard in the song ""Can You Hear Me"" a tribute to Lisa ""Left-Eye"" Lopes, and Aaliyah, which features the likes of TLC (T-Boz and Chilli). Elliott, switches her style from the gangsta rap, into a more slow R&B style which proves successful, as it is probably one of the top 3 tracks on the album."
2,Under Construction,"Missy 'Misdemenor' Elliott can be credited with being one of the most inovative writers & producers in the industry, however her own material does little to reflect her incredible talents. After penning huge singles for the likes of Ginuwine, Aaliyah, Destiny's Child & 702, one might expect Missy to hold on to a tune or two that she can use on her own to her advantage. No such luck.The only hot things on this record are ""Bring the Pain"" with Method Man, ""Gossip Folks"" with Ludacris, ""PussyCat"" & ""Funky Fresh Dressed"" with Ms Jade. The rest of the album is pure garbage and makes fans urn for her to finish the construction next time before releasing it."
3,ITS AIIIIIIIIGHT,"OK 3 1/2 STARS.....This isnt one of my fav Missy cds although it does have some good tracks on it...My favorite track would have to be ...cats but other standouts are Go To The Floor, Nothing Out There, and Bring The Pain. I like how she incorporated some old school feel to this album.. My only problem is the constant ""This is a Missy Elliot exclusive"" on every last song..and I can also do without the talking between songs but other than that, I think its worth the buy. Holla at it."
4,"Not as good as so Addictive, but entertaining","First Off, I love So Addictive better than this. But this is just as entertaining. On the album Missy, obviously, misses the 80's stlye and way. personally, I don't blame her. One thing I don't like is at the begining of almost all the song she says ""The is a Missy one time exclusive"" which gets annoying. But anyway it is worth the money, she shows she still has the most orginal beat in the biz.Fave tracks:Gossip FolkWork ItPussycatNothing Out There For Meall the others are very good also"
5,Best Missy Ever--Hands Down!!!,"This album is full of classic Missy, but with many extra somethings. The Ol'School sound is great and the slick productions are expected. The guests are great, the rhymes are even better.Standout tracks:Gossip FolksFunky fresh Dressed"
2,Too Old School,"I'm a big fan of Missy, but this album is too old school. I listened to the album on one of my friend's headphone sets and felt like throwing it in the garbage. Most of the tracks are old school, and I'm not feeling that. The only song I like on the album is Gossip Folks, the rest is corny. If you like old school, I suggest you buy it, but this is definately not Missy's best album. The Missy album you should go cop is Da Real World or Supa Dupa Fly. Those are Missy's two best albums."
2,So So,Missy has had better albums. I heard her say in an interview that Timberland thinks this was her best album yet. I totally disagree.Please hurry up and give us the next album.
5,P***Y!!!!,I LOVE THIS CD JUST BECAUSE OF ONE SONG P***Y BECAUSE IT IS ALL ABOUT WELL.... HER F***ING P***Y.
2,Definitely the worst of Missy....,"Every now and then major artists take a step in thw wrong direction, that's the case with Missy Elliott on her fourth set ""Under Construction"". Often Missy has found herself changing the face of hip hop and r&b with singles like ""Da Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)"", ""Hot Boyz"", and last years smash ""Get Ur Freak On"", but songs like this just don't seem to exist on ""Under Constructtion"". The first single ""Work It"", with beats by Timbaland and some catchy rhymes, is already climbing up the charts, but you won't find any more radio hits for Elliott on this album. ""Play Dat Beat"" and ""P***ycat"" would be good radio singles for some artists, but are beneath Elliott, and often times on the album other artists like Ms. Jade overpower Elliott (""Funky Fresh Dressed""). All in all, Missy Elliott has definitely took a step in the wrong direction, some advice for Missy is to go back to ""Miss E...So Addictve"", her best set as far as i'm concerned, and get back on the right path."
2,"needs a little more ""construction""","Honestly, i would not recommend buying this album because the only good songs on it are ""Work it"" and ""Pussycat"". i have never been a very big fan of hip hop and this album reminded me why. Your money is probably better spent elsewhere, this album has pretty stupid lyrics,and awful beats.I think i'll go back to the alternative section."
2,"Sorry, just not diggin it......","Missy Elliott is definitely a refreshing presence in the hip-hop scene as, ever since day one, she's always been individualistic. When Missy and Timbaland put their heads together, they usually come up with something wild, off-the-wall, and blazin, but this time around, I just wasn't feeling ""Under Construction."" It was cool how she considered trying to lace every track on her record with an old-school feel, but in her case, I saw it as a waste of time. She tried to change hip-hop classic beats with her own wicked style and it all failed to me. The only cut off this album that I thought was dope was ""Can You Hear Me"" featuring TLC, which is dedicated to the memory of Aaliyah and ""Left Eye""...the beat was mellow and the lyrics were from the heart. Other than that, my advice would be to pass on this Missy album and to check out her older stuff (that's when she was dope)."
5,One of Missy's Best Albums,"""under Construction"" is one of the best Missy Elliott albums I've ever heard. It is also the first one recorded after the deaths of Aaliyah And Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes. It is full of great rhymes and touching goodbyes. One good song on the album is ""Bring The Pain"" with Method Man. It is an adaptation of method man's song (Same name from ""Tical"" in 1994) abd that is a Method Man Classic. The Best Song on the album is ""Can You Here Me?"" featuring T-Boz And Chili. It is a heart-touching goodbye to Aaliyah, Left Eye (for most of the song), Tupac, BIG, Big pun, and all the other greats who's lives were taken. Anyways, This should be in everyone's Rap/Hip-Hop Collection"
3,BACK IN THE DAY AND BACK TO THE PRESENT,"Missy's fourth music delivery is not far to be labeled from tasting like the first three. What makes ""Under Construction"" different from the rest, is the fact, that ""Work It"" made Missy an International Music Star, and established her as a main force in the top 40. But this album is really in touch with the old school Missy, many tracks find themselves lost in that early 80's oblivion, for someone who doesn't understand this, would find this record anoying and boring. But if we focus in the first two singles ""Work It"" and ""Gossip Folks"" I can asure there is no more delightful Pop-Rap-Hip Hop tracks around today, pretty music gems of the new millenium that will stand the test of time."
4,Work it girl,"I rushed out to buy this one after getting hooked on Work It. This album is fun and it has a positive message running through it. Two things prevented this from getting 5 stars. First, some of the words ain't so clear. Does anyone know what she is saying in Work It, when she asks if ?????is wet yet? The other thing which really made me crazy is that at the beginning of nearly every song she says, this is a Missy exclusive. This is annoying. Why didn't anyone edit this out?"
5,a good cd!!,"missy has a good work here...i mean some of the lyrics are out there so don't get it if you can't HANDLE THE TRUTH :-) seriously, it's a fun upbeat cd w/ so good collabo's w/ beyonce, method man and ludacrious. it's going to be jamming in my car and before i go out for a while. and by the way...missy looks GOOD!! her skin is great and her weight loss really suits her. i'm proud of her. i know she was effected by aliyah and left eye but she's going to be alright!!"
5,MISSY IS DA QUEEN OF HIP HOP-SLAMIN CD!!!,What can I say about missy`s new album than great.why great well you know that the `dream team` Timbaland and Missy can`t go wrong `cause everyting they do is great. I supouse you allready heard Work it well the hole album is one come back to old school with a lot of guests like Ludacris Methodman Beyonce and Tlc that are also back with their new album.So you know what you got to do if you like HIP HOP/R&B-buy; it!!!!!!HIP HOP RULEZ 4EVER
1,not much going on,"""Work It"" is a Funny trip out track& the Video is even better that kind of Corky vibe keeps Missy rolling but it's more novelty than something She should roll with for a whole album.the cameos are pretty boring as well.while She is known for being behind the scenes as a featured artist she just doesn't cut it for me.the lyrics are as Bad as anything that is out here nowadays.alot of Acts these days can't write themselves out of a paperbag&Missy falls into that group.without Beats there isn't much going on."
1,Don't Believe the HYPE!!!!,"The term ""Don't believe the hype"" never applied as much. Are the people who are giving this album 5 stars smokin' *?!! This is by far one of the worst hip-hop albums ever made!! The entire album doesn't flow, beats are lame, (numerous samples including RUN-DMC tunes) lyrics have very little meaning and seem to have been only put together to annoy. This album will make one want to go out and buy Rupaul albums!! Except, even they were better than this!!"
1,Oh no not again...,After 'get your freak on' i didnt think any music could be so bad. Now we have 'work it'. I have listened to several songs of this album 'courtesy' of one of my friends. I could not stick it. This isnt the kind of thing you buy in order to acheive a high IQ.
1,This is proof that looking for good music is a lost cause.,"As if it wasn't bad enough that I had to hear ""Work it"" on the radio every five seconds, someone thought it would be a cruel idea to let Missy Elliot release an entire CD full of similar garbage. If I ever need assistance in committing suicide I might actually buy this album (or maybe if I ran out of coasters to put my drinks on). Missy ""Misdemeanor"" Elliot commits a true crime with the release of this musical atrocity.If you want an example of a truly good hip-hop album check out ""Illmatic"" by Nas."
4,Old skool's aiight!,"Missy Elliott's fourth wonderful appearance has once again amazed me! Her level of music is always very good. She keeps it real with what she does. I think that my favorite tracks are (in no order)Nothing Out There For Me - it's a nice jam of the smooth R&B of the yester year. Beyonce sings beautifully, Missy rap-talks tightly. Oh and I luv their rap arguement at the end!Back In The Day - reminds me of back in the good of days of Hip-Hop when Run D.M.C still were the kings! Jay-Z does a good rap.Funky Fresh Dressed - wow! it's hot. Ms. Jade gives a good appearance here and Missy raps out to a tight beat on this one!Bring The Pain - Method Man sample track, but I just gotta say PARTY! PARTY! PARTY!Can You Hear Me? - I hope Lisa can hear me, dang, I miss Left Eye. Aaliyah, B.I.G, Big Pun, Big L, 2Pac so many peeps gone!Oh well this album is hot if you enjoyed the good old dayz of Hip-Hop when ""no one came through with a gun..."""
4,Would've given 5 stars but...,"Missy E. talks too much on this cd, interrupting the flow. I love the songs and the beats are so cool, I just wish she hadn't decided to talk so much."
4,A True Innovator,"Missy isn't scared to try new things. This woman can sing, rap, dance and produce. Her video's are always fire and refreshing. This album has tight beats and the vocals are typical Missy...doing her thing.."
4,okay she's still here ain't she,not a bad cd coming from missy her and timbaland has done it again nuff said.
1,Holy crap,"I swear, hip hop is going downhill. With idiots like Missy Elliot trying their hand at rapping and succeeding, there's no telling what other talentless f***ers will show up to 'change the game'. She is by far the worst rapper to ever release an album into the hip hop culture and should be banned from releasing anymore (but it's too late for that, i.e. This Is Not A Test). Her lyrics are just f***ing stupid and sexed out, and how she got rappers and singers with actual skill to participate in this crap is a mystery. Someone needs to kill her before she releases anymore crap like this into the world."
1,Good for a coaster,Under construction? Maybe she should finish what she started. The CD is incomplete. The beats are awful. This girl has no talent. She should seriously retire.
1,Yet another untalented female rapper.,"While listening to some of the songs on this album I am absolutely perplexed at how she is famous and rich.She has no real talent of her own so she gets jay z,aaliyah,beyonce and a million other people to be featured on her album.How original is that.She makes cheesy beats which obviously requires no musical skill and she couldnt sing if her life depended on it.All she talks about is bling bling, how she thinks she's better than everyone and how she hates men.How original is that.People need to wake up and realise how unoriginal and untalented she really is."
2,Buy with cautions,The knobs on the lids are loose and fall off easily. The handle of the frying pan is also coming off.I'm replacing this set.
5,My Son's Favorite Book,My son just loves this book and I can see why...the pictures are extremely detailed and the story is simple but amusing. I was glad I bought it used...the book was in like-new condition for about a quarter of the new-book price. I would order this again.
2,Not what was described,"We got this book for our one-year-old daughter who fell in love with it when we checked it out of the library. We couldn't find it new, so went with a merchant on Amazon. It was described as 'like new' condition, but when we received it, someone else's name was written inside the cover and there were pages that were ripped and wrinkled. I would not have been as disappointed if the condition had been described as 'gently used' or something similar."
5,Great for Speech/Language Therapy for Toddlers and Above,"My 2 1/2 yr old daughter has the Autism Spectrum Disorder PDD-NOS. Her Speech Therapist used this book with her and she loves it. It is a wonderful way to help children practice speaking in the most natural way possible.As a mom, I am always looking for ways to reinforce what the therapists do to help my daughter. This book allows me to do that."
2,Bonaparte Family,This family is very interesting but the writing doesn't convey it. The author rambles back and forth throughout the years. He includes French poems but doesn't the translation in English. I'm about half way through and don't know if I will finish this dreary book
2,Not for tall people,"Got 2 of them, but unfortunately had to return them. Still too short for a guy of 6.3'. The fabric doesn't go down far enough, i.e. there is no support for the lower leg/heel. In other words not comfortable unless you're willing to put a cushion over the lower bar, which is a hazzle."
4,Shop around,"This is a nice chair. It was listed as a special sale price, but, one week after buying, I saw it for thirty dollars less in a catalog with free shipping. So, buy the chair, but, look around unless money is no issue."
5,MORE CONNIE!!!! - MORE CONNIE!!!! - PLEASE!!!!,I just can't get enough of this CD! Connie's voice and extremely sensitive emotional interp retation brings to mind a divine combination of Streisand and Jane Oliver.The collection of material is a mix of old Broadway standards and wonderful original material. In particular the track 'Shadows and Air' (Written by Pachl and her artistic collaborator Michael Brill) combines an unforgetable melody and message with lush orchestrations. The net result is a truely inspirational piece of music that gives me chills every time I hear it. Then there's 'The Little Goat Herd' from 'The Sound of Music' swooping in to provide some comic relief while still allowing Connie to dazzle us with her remarkable voice.I WANT MORE CONNIE!
4,"Both Intimate and Bold, Connie Sings Us Her Heart","With musical moods ranging from jaunty to tender, giddy to introspective, Connie has a remarkable ability to present material which is deeply personal without a trace of maudlin sentiment. Her voice displays a lovely, warm intimacy, both with her lyrical topics, and towards her audience, and every word shines as clear as glass. This CD offers up a satisfying blend of comfortable old chestnuts and beautifully crafted new songs, most notably by musician's musician, Michael Brill. All in all, a lovely album from a lovely singer, unafraid to sing us her heart."
3,zipnet,"Pretty cool product, but can't really call it 'adjustable'. I could not see how it should adjust.Also, we came across country with it and it snapped the ends off in two places. We did have a large odd load but I would have hoped it could have been stronger for the price."
4,Very Sweet,"Have you you ever had to make a decision that would determine the rest of your life? In Leo's debut novel, the main character Lucy is thrown into a whirlwind of confusion that sends her into a mad dash to make a choice between stability or passion. What will be her final decision? Read on to find out and don't forget to pick up a copy of her second novel entitled ""For Better or Cursed"".Mary Leo is an excellent writer and I look forward to seeing more books in the future. I also recommend her because I am a proud niece!"
2,Dull book,I wasn't overly thrilled with this novel. It was a strange story and didn't hold my interest.
1,Disappointing,"Not a good book AT ALL, and I'm sorry I bought it. I've actually donated it without even finishing it."
3,"Nice, pricey and not so compatible","I bought this product to be on a PC/MAC network. Documentation is scarce even on the Lacie site. Although it does not say, it is programable from a MAC without installing any software if you know its IP address. Its mayor problem is that it will not accept backing up long name files, and this is an issue Lacie should work on.I was even able to upgrade its firmware from a MAC browser.Lacie should offer more user info and MAC compatibility on this product."
5,Es una obra maestra (A Master piece.....),Sam Mangwana posee una de las mejores voces de la música popular congolesa (y eso es mucho decir porque una de las características de esa música es que tiene muchas buenas voces). Este disco compacto contiene todas las canciones de dos LP's que fueron grabados entre 1978 y 1979. Los arreglos musicales son exquisitos. Toda persona que quiera tener ejemplos de música africana con fuerte influencia caribeña debe escuchar este disco.
3,Great Excercises But REPEATS!!!,"The video was great, but the exercises are repeats. Both models do the same exercises as the first. Only two guys are shown naked throughout the video. Only one seems to get a good partial erection. There was several opportunities in the Behind the Scenes and Out Takes to show a guy with a full erection, but each time he covered himself and no effort was put forth to show it.The videos were good entertaining and informative. One guy was much cuter than the other one. I feel insulted when they cut out the erection scenes so i would not recommend the video unless you have ot buy an exercise video anyway. It is good just don't look for anything special at all."
2,Terrible work out video,It is obvious that this was not meant to be a serious exercise video. It looks like it was filmed in someone's garage. The exercises are not very good and the models do not look like they are familiar or comfortable doing them. Even as eye candy the models are questionable. The concept if fun but the quality is poor. The try to keep the models in a state of arousal for the viewer's enjoyment however only one of the two models is up to the task.
3,Good preparation but errors in explanations are frustrating,"I found the descriptions and guided examples of the various types of logic problems quite good. However, when dealing with the practice problems, it is extremely frustrating to find errors in the problem explanations! Most of the errors I have encountered are careless typos, but enough to make the explanation of that particular problem question useless. I think someone needs to go back and proof-read and print an errata sheet. Otherwise, the practice is very helpful."
5,"Muskhil Gusha, a storey of transformation","The story itself is magical, in the practical sense. I have been telling the story either to myself or sharing the story of Muskhil Gusha with others over the years and every time I learn something new. This particular commentary on this story is very helpful to understand the wide penetration and implications of this wonderful web called LIFE."
1,For what ??,"Buy this whole weak album, one of MEgadeth's worst, just for the sake of a single bonus track ??? You must be kidding ...."
3,Risk.. was it worth it?,"Although Risk is a great example of fine musicanship and quality, this is a great example of ""newer style"" metal. There are 4 fairly heavier type songs on this album, the others are somewhat light compaired to older style Deth. By having this variety it lets you listen to the album eldlessly without boredom. A great buy indeed. Megadeth takes a risk and succeeds, congrats Megadeth on the style change, they did it extremely well."
3,the first disco metal album.,"This is very different from dave 'metal pioneer' mustaine and the band. if you a huge fan of their old stuff don't buy it but is you a music lover and want to hear something new, listen to this. maybe the correct concept album of this risk album is disco metal, yes the first disco metal album in the world."
2,Maybe I'm Missing Something...,"I read this book in a day- very short and very vague. This is the first I've read of this author so I don't know if this is his style or a different feel than his other books. It is basically filled with characters that hate their Jewishness. However, these characters are one dimensional, boring sketches that failed to interest me. I kept trying to ponder this book after finishing for some worthy or powerful statement of Anything! All I discovered is that I'm GLAD some books are really short."
2,Cards Are Not Included With This Item,"The book is a wonderful addition to my library. Unfortunately, the item details specify the inclusion of a small 78 card Thoth card deck. This is not the case. No cards are included. An excellent purchase if you do not expect to get the Thoth deck with your order."
5,Great companion to Tarot deck,"The Angeles book is good but a bit too happy in its interpretations. This one is more real, less fluff."
5,Perfect fit for beach cruiser!,285 mm kickstand fit my 27 year old Earth Cruiser perfectly! No trimming necessary. I used the long bolt but the short on would also have worked fine. The foot is great on the beach sand!
1,Angle all wrong for a tall bike,"Don't buy this kickstand if you have a tall bike. I have a 20 inch framed 26 inch wheel bike. The angle on this stand is too slanted, it makes the bike just fall right over with the slightest touch. And as R. Hall says, it does damage the paint, but that wasn't a large concern for me."
4,Nice...and no need to buy a rubber foot!!,Definitely a nice high quality kickstand. Don't believe the Amazon suggested product of the rubber foot!! You don't need it because this package already comes with one.
4,Good quality but may not fit,"This is a heavy duty kickstand with positive movement and the construction just feels good. I also appreciate the fact that it's made in the USA. The black finish is nice looking and the design is simple and clean. However, it does not fit on my particular bike (Nashbar Hounder). There's no mount on the frame for a kickstand and there isn't enough clearance to use the top bracket and included bolt either. I'll have to try out a rear mounted kickstand. That's too bad because this really does seem like a great stand."
5,Awesome black kickstand,"Ordered the 285mm length. Fit with no issues on my son's 18"" bike. No cutting involved. Also very easy for my 8 year old to use. No struggling with the kickstand to put it up or down. Great buy! (Only wish the rubber boot was included, but hey, I should be happy for paying less than 10 bucks.)"
5,"lightweight, nice looking, sturdy, inexpensive","I went from bike shop to bike shop trying to find this style of kick-stand in glossy black to go on my new bike (silver would have looked stupid and that's all I could find at half a dozen bike shops). I got this one and it is great.I have a pretty large bike since I'm pretty tall and I assumed the shorter version would be just about the right size, or perhaps only slightly too small. I went ahead and got it because it had Prime shipping as an option and was a bit cheaper... It was too long! I used a hacksaw and trimmed it about 3/4"" and now it's perfect. It includes a rubber foot for the tip of the stand, so you can't tell it's been shortened."
3,Nice product but not as universal as they claim.,"Nice product but I am restoring a 1998 Judy Rock TREK 8000SL mountain Bike and converting it into a commuter with higher handlebars, less shock, street tires, lunch rack and a lot more comfort. I'm tool old to go slamming down hills anymore and the bike is quite the looker for a 98. Alas there was no mount for this stand so a nice kid in the neighborhood got it."
3,Beware: Wrong Color Sent,"Ordered what was listed as a black bike kickstand, but was sent a chrome one. Sturdy stand though, and I figured that buying a can of spray paint would be cheaper than the postage in sending it back."
1,Definitely not as advertised,"Never fit my bicycle, unlike they advertised. Totally useless, totally a liar and complete wasting of my money. Also almost no instruction on how to adopt it. Extremely poor product."
3,Even the small one is too long for my bike.,"I'm about 5' 8"" and ride a ""medium"" sized hybrid (Specialized Sirrus). Even the smaller of these two kickstands is FAR too long for my bike. I've wound up leaving the thing off for now while I figure out what I want to do with it.The finish and included mounting hardware are pretty nice."
4,Works fine,"I put this on my 700cc bike. I had to grind off about 3/8"". and not use the rubber foot that it comes with. Full length kept my bike almost straight up and down and if facing the right way in the wind would blow over. So far does not rattle."
4,works fine on Jamis Exile,I have a 17 inch Jamis Exile mtn bike and the kickstand mounted easily and works just fine - really like the black color
3,Doesn't fit,This kickstand does not fit my Diamondback Trace Comp. Since the package had been opened I couldn't return it to the vendor so it's gone to the Salvation Army. Some reviewers have said it comes with a rubber tip ... mine did not.
2,Doesn't fit,The specification should give some indication of the size of bolt hole (diameter) required to fit generic bikes. The new Diamondback we just bought has a smaller diameter hole where the kickstand should fit. Frustrating.I wish I'd read through all the reviews; if so I'd have found that a reviewer also had a Diamondback bike and it didn't fit...It's not Greenfield's fault that they don't make a stand that fits every bike ever made but the description should give an indication of the hole diameter so people don't order an item that will never fit.
1,Poorly cut down from TV script,"It's clear that the book is an attempt to fit a whole TV special into a book. It's done poorly, and there even are characters who appear without explaination in the last few pages! I'd skip this book and buy others from the Arthur series."
1,NOT MARC BROWN'S BEST WORK,"my 3 year old is the biggest arthur fan and we have way too many of the books. we bought him this book for christmas and i was so disappointed in the way it was written. it jumps from character to character and there isn't a very good plot. why can't christmas be christmas, i felt that marc brown spent way to much time trying to cram every other winter holiday into a christmas book that he missed the ""marc"""
3,A Great Christmas,"This is a great book about Christmas! In the book Arthur wanted everything to beperfect. Arthur decorated the tree. He also got a present for his mom anddad. Unfortunately, the present broke. Arthur learned what the best thing aboutChristmas really is. Read this book to find out what the best thing about Christmas is!"
5,Star Trek dvd: Brought Back memories,"I Loved these 2 episodes, color and definition Great!!! I can't wait to order more Star Trek:Original Series DVDs!!LIVE LONG AND PROSPER!!!!"
1,boring,"The scenery was almost all colorless, Winter landscapes. There were lengthy concentrations on dull colored grasses, up and down them, back and forth on them, in and out of them. I was very disappointed. Don't buy this if you are looking for beautiful mountain scenery with variety or relaxing music. The music was sharp toned and distracting although I have to say the boring aspect of it all did make me sleepy."
1,waste of money,i should have paid attention to the negative review. the video quality is horrible. looks like someone copied it from the screen it was being projected. i would not purchase this. save your money
4,A great riff on Ruth...,"Yes, as the previous reviewer notes, this is an interpretation of the classic monologues by Patricia Norcia, rather than by Ruth Draper herself.That said, this cd is a delight in itself, a beautifully nuanced tribute to the ""Divine Miss Truth"", and a must-listen for all of us who love these amazing and mind-bendingly funny views of the human comedy. A great riff on a classic work!"
1,Hilarious to the 1000th Degree,"This had to have been the worst ""Alien"" space movie ever made. Yes it is the early 80's and the special effects are not meant to be great. But the ""alien"" was hilarious. Killer/Religious/Buddy.And he looked like someone sneezed and left it on the wall. And the end theme song was ear bleedingly bad. Watch for pure laughter not for any other reason because there isn't any other reason to watch it."
1,TOTALLY AGE INAPPROPRIATE,"This book is totally age inappropriate. I agree with some of the other comments about the book being too ""dark"" for children. Not only is the book too ""dark"" for children, it is teaching our children negative ways to display themselves. Whatever happened to teaching our children wrong from right and trying to help them make the ""correct"" decisions. I did not find one part of this book that had positive in it. Why would we even put these things in our children's minds. There are plenty of bad things in this world, but none of which I would like to sit & read my 5 year old a book about. I'm sorry, but there is no way this book could receive a good review from me or my husband. I know that this world is not all milk and cookies, but I wish there WAS more of that. Maybe then, we would see less violence and more love and respect for humankind."
1,VERY INAPPROPRIATE FOR ELEMENTARY-AGED CHILDREN!!!,"Oh my gosh! I got to the Dr. X page (in the beginning) and couldn't believe my eyes! I was reading this to my kindergartner who checked it out of the school library! I believe, as do all of my friends and husband, that this book is not appropriate for children! I took it into the school librarian and she totally agreed. She is going to point it out to the school's media specialist tomorrow. I can't believe so many positive reviews are listed here! Why even put the idea of voodoo, x-ray vision to see your bra and underpants, h-e double hockey sticks, etc., into a six-year old's head!? You parents should be ashamed of yourselves for supporting and reading this book to your small children! I HIGHLY discourage any responsible parent from buying or reading this book to their children!"
1,Bad News,This book is not appropriate for children. It has Poems pertaining to a scientist with x ray vision looking at bras and underpants. A hypnotist that hypnotizes women so that he can kiss them and the devil in Hell buying souls.
4,Great First Effort,"I know that this isn't a perfect game, not by a longshot. The truth is, this is the best soccer game on a handheld I've ever played, and a ton of fun to boot. The amazing thing is how they've managed to pack a full console game's worth of options and features into a small, handheld game. Create-a-player? Check. Season mode? Check. The list goes on. There are some gripes, namely the stuttery animation when the ball goes out of bounds, or the sketchy controls (no secondary analog stick means... it's really hard to control the freestyle moves), but the truth is, it's still a blast to play."
3,Fifa has had better.,"This is a good game but it is not the best one i have played. It has bad graphics and the game is very hard. It has some good music on it but most of it is annoying. It is fun but it takes forever to beat the game and after u beat it it is just like any other fifa games, u just do quick games. It is really annoying when the game freezes after the ball goes out or u score a goal. Sometimes it unfreezes but it takes like five miniutes to do so. This game is really old and was made before the psp even came out but it still has really bad graphics and game play. I would buy a newer one if i were u."
5,Wonderful purchase,My son like the FIFA soccer and he is having fun with this item. It has over 50 soccer games.
2,Lots of replay value...unfortunate gameplay lags.,"While this game is lots of fun, you'll find some almost-unacceptable gameplay lags.When you take a shot on goal, if you score, no lag. If it ends up deing deflected or shot out of bounds (which happens more than scoring, of course), there's about a 2-second lag while the game processes the out-of-bounds. Also, when pausing, there's about a 4 second lag before the pause screen appears. Sometimes *gasp* you have to press it twice to get the pause. Like I said, the game is enjoyable and I play it a lot, but these little lags make you feel like you're playing something that was rushed out of the door to make the PSP launch.I've heard the newer Fifa 06 for PSP fixes these little annoyances, but that's not firsthand knowledge."
3,Just an average game,"This game is just an average game. The graphics are decent, gameplay is good, and load times are bad. The reaction time is poor, and there are some pauses that slow down the game (like when the ball goes out of bounds). There really aren't any special features, EA should have added mini games, franchise, and online play.Buy it if you like Fifa, save your money if you don't."
3,Definitely not a professional quality iron,"This iron feels light and cheap. There is no weight to the barrell at all, making it extremely hot and prone to burning hair, even on lower settings. For professional use, the ""stay cool tip"" does nothing more than get in the way. Definitely wishing I had shopped around a bit more for an iron. Not the worst iron I've ever used, but far from the best. However, I paid $32 for this iron in a store, but I see it sells here for around twenty which, for me, would buffer the disappointment in this being such a cheesy product."
1,Ugh,"This book may well have been filled with great writing, however, as a dog owner and lover, I was disgusted and depressed reading these stories. The reviews on the book cover give little indication as to the repeated ugliness within. If you are a parent, imagine reading story after detached story of babies being killed, lost and neglected. For me, any great writing was overshadowed by my sympathies for the dogs. Not what I expected and very sad."
5,"Memorable, indeed unforgettable stories.","Watson's using Dogdom as a point of reference for human yearnings and frustrations is a master stroke. Though his blending of hilarity and pathos might be called a characteristic of Southern Lit., his voice and his insights are unique. This book is a ""keeper."""
3,"Wonderful writing, some very ugly characters","This is a collection of 8 short stories, each one with a dog involved, its behaviors and relationship with the people driving the story. There is no doubt that Brad Watson is a talented writer. His characters jump off the page presenting themselves to you forcefully. Some of his metaphors and similes left me shaking my head mumbling, 'how did he come up with that?'Having said that, I didn't enjoy Last Days entirely. This is a sad, ugly book. I had no problem with the melancholy characters and the beautiful way Watson presented their lives. But some of these stories are inhabited by ugly people doing cruel things, both to other people and to the dogs in their lives. If you are a dog lover as I am, be forewarned that dogs die in this book at the hands of selfish, arrogant characters."
2,NOT FROM THE 'MOVIE' ! ! !,"May be a good dog's short story book, but if you were looking for the book from the movie, 'Last of the Dogmen', this is NOT IT! The cover art may lead you to think so, but not even clorse!"
4,A True Friend in the Editing Room,This book helped me to put aside all doubt and really get a product. It made the process very easy and was a constant help throughout the whole editing experience. I feel a more competent and able editor thanks to this book. I hope everyone considers it when making their next purchase!
1,Size not correct.,"Returning this one. I got it in red and it is not what it is supposed to be (size wise). I am using the same size (and brand) at my PT/Chiro office and I thought I am getting it cheaper here at Amazon so I decided to buy it here. I am just going to buy it directly from my PT so I can get started doing my exercises using the ball at home.Not sure why the sizing is not correct. If not for that issue, I would have kept it."
4,Thera-Band Exercise Ball,The ball has worked great and I have never had to add air to it since inflation.
5,great ball,The ball is made of heavy material so you don't feel you have to be careful with it. Holds air well.
1,Ball was slimy,When I opened the box and pulled the ball apart my hands became covered in a thin layer of an oil like substance. I returned the product because I didn't expect to have to spend my time degreasing it before my first use.
1,nothing in package but the exercise ball,"Once I opened the package, I realized that the only thing in there was the ball itself. It was supposed to also include an air compressor adapter, inflation plugs, and a plug remover. However, I did not open the package until a month or so after receiving it so I cannot return it now. It was my fault for trusting that everything I needed was in there. Now, I cannot use the ball now since I cannot inflate it! Be wary and take my advice: do not trust that everything is in the package. Open it immediately so you can return it if need be."
4,Good Product,"This ball is a good product, however, I didn't recieve my exercise poster that was supposed to come with the ball. For me this is no big deal as I just went online to download a ball exercise program. I still feel that I was ripped off by not getting my poster with my purchase. Big hassel to return for just a poster. The ball for some reason comes with a greasey substance on it. I had to wash it before I could use it. Other then that, it is a good product."
2,exercise ball,"For the price, I guess it was worth it. I did not like the material or feel of the ball. It did blow up just fine and is definitely for short people. I am 5'5"" and I should have got the 65 CM ball. If you don't want to pay more for your 1st ball, I would recommend this. Other than that I would pay more for a better material. The material was thick and no problems with it bursting or holding the weight."
4,This item is a BALL!,delivered on time as promised with a liberal exchange policy that I took advantage of
1,Extremely disappointed - How can I return,"Was supposed to be a 45 cm ball. I don't see how. Even when I inflate it to as much as it seems to hold, it still does not measure 45 cm. But, even if it is (and I am doing something wrong), it is certainly not functional. The ball is hard as a rock. So, given it's size, makes it impossible to lay on unless you want to feel like you are pressing your abdomen against a rock. Worthless."
3,Good Sex,Its goood to practice sex on. Thats it. I also poked a hole on it because me and my girlfriend were having sex and it popped so good for a while.
2,ball good service bad,"We ordered the RED size ball, received a GREEN. Called and was promised the RED size would be shipped express and we'd have the next day. Couple of days later called again and was told they forgot to ship the replacement ball express and we'd have in a few more days. Sorry. Finaly received correct ball and return mail tag for wrong size. Finaly got what we ordered and it is as ordered. Not much to say about a red ball."
4,Well-made but diminutive,"As many of the reviews state, the Thera-band exercise ball is of good quality and comes with an excellent booklet of exercises and activities. After the ball finished outgassing (it smelled like vinyl flooring for about 12 hours) I came across a longer-term problem: size. I'm 6' so I ordered the suggested 65 cm/26"" ball. Unfortunately the ball is closer to 20"" in height. I thought I'd confused diameter and circumfrence, but after reviewing my geometry realized that wasn't the problem. These are small balls, no way around it. I recommend ordering a larger ball than suggested by the manufacturer."
4,I've Got a Thera-Band....For You!,"This is a great product, well-made. However, my son who is under 5' is nearly too big for this ball. We will have to buy the next size sooner than I'd thought. So if you are over 4'10"", I'd recommend going straight to the next size."
1,false advertising,"The 75 cm ball I ordered was way smaller than that. When free standing and inflated to where it was hard, it measured only 60 cm in diameter. I used a level and yardstick to get an accurate measurement."
1,ball too small,"I fit the size th at the 45inch ball said it was for. Yet,the ball was too small. It also has a sticky feel to it. i researched this a lot and this was the only one that said it closely fit my height."
5,"Good quality, I'm using it as an office chair","A good product, seems quite thick and durable. I'm sitting on it now. I like that it's made in USA. I'm 6-2 and the 75 cm ball seems to be the right height for sitting at my computer desk. I'm still working up to using the ball exclusively."
3,Not real impressed.,"I thought the instructions for the ball really sucked as far as inflatingwas concerned, but I finally figured it out. I'm not real thrilled withthe product."
1,Exercise Ball,There wasn't a pump included in shipment to blow up the exercise ball. I still don't have it blown up because I have to purchase a pump even though a pump was to be included in shipment! I have another ball I got from a store and I love it! I probably will not use the one I got from here because it is more of a hassle than fun!
1,not happy,"The ball I ordered was for height 4' 7""- 5'. I am 4'11"". It was too small I cannot sit on it and exercise. It is however not their fault, I should have investigated further. But when I tried to return the ball they would not pay for postage as it was free shipping. The ball itself was $16.75 and postage was $8.95. So I kept the ball.I am unhappy."
4,As Presented,The exercise ball was as presented in the Amazon listing. Delivery was prompt. We are happy in all regards.
1,Theraband exercise ball quality has fallen dramatically.,"The company that sells Theraband products has been very helpful and replaced the ball when I complained. Unfortunately, the second ball wasn't much better than the first - both were not spherical but more oblong like an egg. This makes it difficult to do some of my exercises. Seems like a new cheap Chinese model versus the model I bought several years ago which is very round and works well."
2,Sizing is WRONG on the exercise ball,"Six years ago, I bought a Thera-band 65cm ball to use at the office. It was the perfect height for my 5'7"" frame and it has lasted beautifully. I recently splurged and bought a 2nd 65cm Thera-band ball for home. Same brand, same 65cm size, however it turns out that it is SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER than my original 65cm Thera-band ball. I emailed them and did not get a satisfactory response. I don't know if they went to a cheaper supplier or what the problem is, but it is really unfortunate. Their current 65cm ball is too small for someone who is 5'7""."
4,just as described... love it!,"item works as described, I got the suggested hand air pump with it and filled it in (took a while, expected with such a small pump) have used the ball for a week and still firm; although i bought for my size (5'7 - 6'1) i had my husband (6'3) tried it, like a resistance test and it passed!!!"
2,not anti-burst warning label on box.,"it would've been nice if the description was listed prior purchasing. I had no idea that this ball is not anti-burst. so this ball can't do a lot of positions except for situps and stretching my upper back. I'm also not that heavy so i imagine that it will not burst on me but still, it would have been nice to get an anti-burst ball since all the gyms have it, too. therabands products just don't supply enough information or instructions on their website too. not reliable company."
4,"This is an inspiring cd, please listen",On this cd Marty does a pretty good job of mixing it up. He uses multi sounds on this project. He even throughs in a vocal track that works real well.Marty seems to be very versatile and it shows with this cd. He gives some superb performances on this outing.The songs being performed seemed to be a lot of my favorites. It's been a while since I have heard a lot of these tunes. I don't believe the songs offered here have ever sounded better.Do yourself a favor and buy this cd to see for yourself. It's that good.
1,Don't waste your money!,"Jacket looks good on-line but is truly not quality product.The first day I had it the pockets came seperated and the buttons fell off.Captian Daves offered to replace it, but was not worth the hassle of returning.I stitched it up and gave it away!"
5,N3B Snorkel Parka Flight Jacket,Parka came in promptly and was exactly what I thought it would be. I was updated regularly via EMail as to the status of my order and am very satisfied with the product and the service.
2,coat,the coat has a zipper that isn't long enough I can't stay warm in it good looking coat but can't stay warm in Maine
4,Great parka,"Exactly as described, very light, but warm parka. It's big, so you'll have to order at least one size smaller you normally wear. The only issue is that buttons are poorly stitched and fell off by the end of the first day. I restitched them all, so all good now. Not a big deal, otherwise it's a great product."
3,Good jacket,"The biggest problem with this jacket is it is DRY CLEAN ONLY!!!! I returned it, never wore it, but it did look like a nice warm jacket."
3,WARM COAT!,"A warm coat for freezing winter days - it's like wearing your duvet. Quality is not brilliant, it is made in China and has a lot of loose threads, and the snap fasteners and the zip are not the best quality, but for this price its not bad value. A top quality parka would cost you at least double the price. Order at least one size too small as in the description! Maybe 2 sizes smaller for some."
4,Quieter then expected,"Bought and installed on a Tyan Tempest i5000VF in a pedastal case with 2 Xeon 5130's. Even though the the Xeon's are only clocked at 2Ghz, and the PWM fans are controlled by the BIOS, there's enough copper and mass with these that they barely register as warm to the touch."
3,Skip track 10 (Breeze ... should be Cheese ...),"This CD starts off with real potential to be a must have, but never really builds on a good start. Track 10, ruins the whole CD for me, a really cheesey tune with terrible lyrics and awful schoolgirl singing ... why on a dub CD, I ask ?. Buy it if you like dubtribe or want to annoy the neighbours with track 10."
2,"Good writing, but not my cup of tea","Okay, while this is a well written book, I did not like all of the Christian elements of it. I understand it is part of the story, but it just took me out of it.If you are Christian or enjoying reading about their faith, I say pick it up, because the writing of Joel Rosenberg is always superb."
2,Not his best work,"I love Joel, but I would skip this book, and did skip the sequel. I guess even a great writer sometimes misses."
2,Not up to Rosenberg's standards,"I have read several of J.R.'s books with satisfaction. This book is much more ponderous than anything I have read by him to date. The book attempts to be the light hearted adventure of his previous series (Guardians of the Flame) but falls way short. The basic story and premise are interesting, but the story itself is lackadaisically written requiring me to make a concerted effort to finish the book. It feels as though the characters are going in circles and the story randomly jumps from one character to the other, making it very tiresome to read. Typically I would rate Rosenberg's work as B to B+, this one is a D-."
1,Boring,"On my bookshelves I have 11 hardcover books by Joel Rosenberg plus several paperbacks. I thoroughly enjoyed all of them. Rosenberg has few equals when it comes to action and adventure mixed with humor and an assortment of interesting and likable characters. That is why Paladins is such a huge disappointment. The book is totally devoid of humor. There is some action, but the scenes are interspersed with numerous pages of dullness. The characters must set a record for pomposity. Few of them are interesting or likable. The word that comes to mind that most describes this book is BORING. The book jacket says this is the beginning of a new series. I sincerely hope not. Mr. Rosenberg, as a favor to your loyal readers, go back to what you do so well, and give up on this abomination."
5,A great read,I loved Marcus in the first book and was excited to read the book about him. I especially liked how the message (about whether God really answers prayers) didn't overshadow the plot. I enjoyed what she had to say and enjoyed being entertained while reading it.
2,A big disappointment,"This book is written like the script for a USA Networks movie - corny, predictable and slow. It is not a page turner, so if you must read it, set your expectations low."
5,TOTALLY AWESOME!,This book is the best that I've read in the series. You can't go wrong reading any of the books in the O'Malley Series but I thought this one was the best. I related to Shari well and fell in love with Marcus. It's suspensful and romantic and Dee Henderson did an AWESOME job on this one!
2,NOT MY CUP OF TEA,"I am aware that this novel falls into the Christian literature classification, however the spiritual conflict as well as the romantic aspect of the story falls short and the family dynamic is improbable. As for the ""she saw the killer and now she's at risk, so let's send in Mr. Wonderful to protect her"", the story has been done to death.This could, however, be a perfect vehicle for the WE (women's entertainment) cable network to purchase and produce. (All of their shows seem to be of this caliber). The story is sugary, Marcus O'Malley comes across as a combination of Clint Eastwood and Robert Young, and the women in the story are generally portrayed as helpless, in need of a man's love and protection in order to survive. All in all, there isn't a really believable character in the book. (1 1/2 stars)"
5,The Quardian,I love the books by this author and would recommend them whole heartedly to others. This book was excellent. Thans
4,Excellent story,I thoroughly enjoyed reading the entire 'O Malley series. The story of Marcus' struggles was completely engrossing and made it hard to put down
4,The Guardian,Exciting book. Dee Henderson knows how to stark your interest in her books. You don't want to put them down.
5,the bratz dolls have a camping fever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,"the bratz are still in style when they go camping.i would recommend this toy to be bought.if any,and i mean any,person say that they hate this playset,i would say that they are crazy.sorry you have to hear it like that. by Talia Garrett"
4,KINDA COOL???,Why would the bratz want to go camping anyway???I Love the outfits there wearing but how can you go camping in that?????I kinda like the campfire tent idea but looks like a ripoff.I LOVE BRATZ!!!!! BYE
5,Beautiful camping tent for the Bratz campfire dolls.,I think this tent is sooooo adurable.It`s so beautiful.I think the small accissories are soooo cute.SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*
1,"Concept is good, support is not","Aviator seems to have everything, but getting it to work is not easy.Support from Saitek is non-existant. I sent several emails requesting support and received no replies. Would NOT recommend purchase."
5,Works great with x-plane on a mac,"I bought this for my son, who has a new macbook with x-plane installed. We couldn't get other joysticks to work, but this worked perfectly. All the buttons and switches were easily programmed in the x-=plane program. A great joystick for the money."
4,Almost perfect,"This is a great joystick to use with any flight simulator. I personally use it with MSFSX, so the fire buttons do not make much sense for me, but it is ok. It is awesome, mainly because of the double throttles which can be configured for two engines or engine/mixture or whatever you want. However, there is a BIG issue which would make me think twice before buying it: it does not have any vacuum rubber or velcro to stick it on the table. As a consequence, frequently you have to use the other hand to hold its base. What I did was to buy those velcro strips with stickers, which helped me to keep it steady on the table. But my question is: did not Saitek Designers tested their own product? Should not those velcros come with this product, as they did with their rudder pedals? In spite of that, I am satisfied and would definitely recommend it."
3,"good in Win 7, not so good in Win XP","Overall I like this joy stick, good feel and lots of features. Unfortunately, I can't use many of the programmable features in XP SP3 because the profile editor will not run, it shuts down with a ""need to close"" message. This happened with the latest 32 bit download (the one that came with the joystick was worse, instead of shutting down the profile editor, it would blue screen). Deleting and reinstalling multiple times has not cured the problem, and none of the suggestions on the Saitek forum has helped. In the Win 7 64 bit install, the installation went smoothly except, as others have noted, if you are installing on a laptop using the touchpad, the installation turns off the touchpad and I needed to dig up a USB mouse to turn it back on.So, absolutely download the newest install files from Saitek, and if you are running 64 bit Win 7, this joystick is a very good choice. If you are still in XP, not so good unless you can live without the profile editor."
1,aviator crashes and burns,"Checked with the Apple Store and Best Buy to get the precise product needed. Amazon never mentioned PC only, Macs need not apply. Once again, holiday time with a toy that's incompatible. Mac users beware! Amazon is not Mac friendly."
4,Get mor ebang for half the price,"I bought this controller few weeks ago to replace my old sidewinder. I like the design of the controller, decent number of programmable buttons and the mode switch feature is really useful. I used this contoller to play Falcon 4.0 AF and I really dig the flip cover of the the missile/bomb button and the red illumination feature of the button is an added bonus. The flip cover adds realism to the game especially when I have my target on-lock. I also play MS Flight Sim 2004, and the dual throttle is surprisingly easy to use to and to get used to.I only found 2 flaws with the Aviator, one is the weight, I agree with some reviewers that it is too light. suction cups at the bottom could've been added. And the support platform is hard to put, move, and remove. Despite the flaws, I enjoy the Aviator and I'm gonna use the heck out of till I can afford the Cougar or X52 pro. I recommended this controller if you dont have the money to buy the best ones out there."
3,Good Joystick for everyday gamer,"This joystick is perfectly fine for those not to serious gamers. If you are a true Flight Simmer you need a yoke, rudder pedals, and a throttle. Or you could a step less than that and get a joystick and separate throttle. BUT for the average, not to rich, and maybe not flight simming gamer this is the BEST JOYSTICK ON THE MARKET. I use it for BF 2, 2142, and FSX. It is a dream and the 24 switches make memorization a pain but every feature at your finger tips (you may see 4 switches but each one goes up and down and the switch in the middle changes the mutton 3 times so each switch plays triple duty). Independent throttles for left and right engines put a whole other axis of movement and control into your aircraft, it is also something the Saitek separate throttle models don't offer."
2,not what I expected,I had many problems with this joystick. It would not calibrate or respond to key designations. I do not recommend.
3,Enjoyable for Older Children,"I watched this yesterday with my sons, ages 3 and 6. Older children might enjoy it (age 5-10), or fans of Celtic music (in particular, Enya). It was not that good for my younger son. Half the time, the animation was too quick to follow. There were many quick ""camera"" changes during action sequences. The second half was very slow moving, and the 3 year old and I both almost fell asleep. The only thing keeping me awake was the haunting music.The music was excellent, but I was surprised that the package and credits didn't give more detail. Two of the melodies are well-known Enya songs. For example, one song has an identical melody to Marble Halls (from the album Shepherd Moons), but with different lyrics. So it seems wrong or incomplete to simply say that Phil Cunningham wrote the music for this DVD.Overall, this was a unique Christmas DVD that made for an enjoyable 24 minutes on a cold Sunday afternoon. But I doubt we will go back and watch it again."
5,Wonderful Christmas Gift,"This was a delightful DVD, full of fun and the wonderful music of Scotland's Phil Cunningham. We bought several to give out as gifts this Christmas season and kept one for our house. Creative, charming, and worth watching for all ages. There are a lot of laughs and a charming monster. We wondered why someone as well known as musician Phil Cunningham was not mentioned on the Amazon description of this DVD.Leistners, Valley Stream, NY"
1,This has many things wrong,"I am sorry to say this, usually I rate dvs and books 4-5 stars cause I have bought very nice, fun and instructive items until I bought this book. I am not a professional drummer, but I am advanced, and there were many subjects I already knew about this. Anyway, it has many WRONG things!!! What made me buy this was the pretty neat title: The Drummer's Bible. Play from afr-cuban to Zydeco... screw this... thats the name of the book just to sell... but is not worth since this guys are wrong in many stuff.. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY IN THIS BOOK... Many concepts are wrong!"
3,"Good Book, Just Not His Style","When my son recently decided to get back into drumming this was one of the recommended books by his teacher. It is well-written and an excellent tool, however it's a little abstract for him---he would prefer to stick with good ol' rock and roll!"
4,useful book!,i've been enjoying using this book with my students. it's a nice go-to source for illustrations of many popular beats and feels. it has some interesting historical text as well describing the various styles at the top of each chapter.a fun and practical read-dcst louis MO
5,Most tensive of all TOS episodes,Doomsday mashine is my favourite TOS episode. Wolf in the Fold is also very exciting. TOS at its best - I recommend it!
4,Star Trek Episodes 35 & 36 ; Classic Melodrama,"If you are a Star Trek fan, you can't get much better than the two episodes placed on this disc. I was only really interested in getting the Doomsday Machine episode (arguably one of the best melodramatic episodes of the series) but was pleasantly surprised to find it packaged with the over-the-top ""suspense"" of ""Wolf in the Fold"". I think it favorably compares to buying the 45 of KISS's ""Beth"" only to find ""Detroit Rock City"" on the flip side!"
5,Classic Trek,The Doomsday machine is one of the greatest episodes of classic Star Trek and Wolf in the Fold is pretty good in its own right. Even though there are a few glitches in the sound track this disc is a perfect addition to the collection for any and all trekkies.
5,Top Notch remaster from Paramount,"I've always considered ""The Doomsday Machine"" to be my favorite Trek episode, and when I received the DVD and played it, I was thoroughly happy with the picture quality, color, and sound. Paramount did a first rate job with this episode. You can hear background sounds that were not there on the video release, and the stereo remaster is excellent. There is one ""omission"" of music in the last act which was surprising, but I felt it was an actual improvement in the episode. Very good DVD to buy...."
3,City of Men,"Of course, after seeing ""City of God"" , one the greatest movies ever made, I decided to buy the series ""City of Men"". In all, it was very good. I would like to say excellent but I think that the directors spoiled 2 of the episodes by showing lewd acts of dogs mating. This was an extreme turn off to me .I don't even know why they would spoil such a good how by adding something like that into the story. To me , this stupid act on the part of the directors to a great series from a 5 star rating to a 3 star rating. I know that they are trying to depict life in the favela but some things are unnecessary. Overall, not counting those 2 bad episodes, I enjoyed the other episodes in the series. Unfortunately, I would be able to buy this DVD as a gift as I intended in the begininng because of the offensive scenes in those two episodes."
4,BRILLIANT!!!,"I love love loved the series! It was so heartwarming, heartbreaking and insightful to see how people from Rio's favelas live. Each episode is about half an hour long and will take you on an emotional journey. I laughed, cried, got scared and was at the edge of my seat pretty much for every single episode. Douglas Silva and Darlan Cunha are brilliant actors!The only problem I had with the product is that it folds out so that each dvd is on its own 'page' but there is no ""case"" or ""cover"" as with box sets.Amazon's free shipping was fast and extremely efficient!Enjoy it!"
5,A well-told story of a little-known event.,"Frances Cogan's meticulous study of American civilians interned in the Philippines by the Japanese during World War II presents fascinating material written in elegant prose. She vividly recounts what it was like for these people to live in a confined area with increasingly dwindling food supplies as the war in the Pacific raged around them. Anyone interested in World War II should read this book.Similar books of interest include Elizabeth Norman's ""We Band of Angels,"" Theresa Kaminski's ""Prisoners in Paradise,"" and E. Barlett Kerr's ""Surrender and Survival."""
1,you will never never know,"Yeah, handsome Lebanese abductors of the male Westerners express some sexual curiosity and no even vogue abduction goals, kindly look after their captives exhibiting their flash time by time and mutually comprehending their own biologically motivated politics-related delusions, good food and clean undies provided on a regular basis.If it was a show point, I regret owning this DVD."
1,bratz camping?,i mean realy if bratz wint camping thay will say this i boke a nail! and if you realy wint camping you would not go in boots? p.s if i boke a nail i would not care!
3,Fairly average,"Fairly Legal is a fairly predictable, semi comic legal drama. The lead character, however is not a lawyer but a negotiator who uses her skills and sexiness to arbitrate all kinds of disputes both legal and personal. Not a bad premise, but the plots are tired and somewhat sexist as the negotiator will use her cutesiness and cleavage rather than her brain to win her case."
2,Love Sarah--but the show is 'dumb fluff',"The other reviewer of this show said it perfect; Sarah Shahi gets to 'shine' in this show as opposed to her rather 'dour' character presentation in her cop show ""Life"". And her 'shine' is awesome--she is gorgeous, sexy and has a spunky character to work with, but...the show seems to say ""Mediation"" is the second coming and that just didn't 'win' me over. Sarah's relationship with her ex-husband the DA is ok and I like how she interacts with the other characters in her short skirts but the 'meat' of the program that Mediation results in a 'win,win' situation for folks headed to Court with lawyers is just not that interesting or believeable. So I found Sarah a '10' and hope she finds another series that matches her dazzling beauty and personality, but I found this show just too 'dumb' and 'light' to continue watching after about 6 episodes. And for some reason, I got this show at Target a month ago 6 weeks before you could buy it on Amazon."
5,Excellent!,"Saw this pilot on Amazon Unbox and loved it. I'll be watching the show on TV now. It is a skillful combination of funny and serious scenes, with the indomitable and endlessly busy Sarah Shahi as Kate demonstrating how to be a mediator in even the most trying situations. The show would be worth watching just to learn how to mediate skillfully, but Kate is so much more than a mediator, and her on-again/off-again relationship with her ex-husband adds interest. The show moves quickly, and its variety of situations and characters keeps it fresh every minute. Recommend."
5,Fairly Legal Season 1,"Today I was at Target looking for season one of the killing (which is a really good show by the way) and next to it I saw this very item next to it. I was shocked and happy because from the minute I saw the title I know I would love it. I was happy and was confused until I saw the little ""Only at Target"" seal. Anyway I bought it for $29.00. The set contains 3 discs and has all ten episodes of season one special features include, exclusive scene comparisons with commentary, deleted scenes, and a gag real. I think anyone should buy this from target simply because it's cheaper. and by the way if anyone's looking for In Plain Sight Season 4 it's target exclusive as well."
2,not at all interesting for me,I only watched the free pilot and did not really enjoy it so I cannot comment on the whole season.
4,Very Entertaining,It is great to see another Arabic person in a good presentation.This is a real woman to me and I have been in contact with many.The TV shows were done well. The blonde in the show is alsoperfect for the show.
4,OKaayy,This show is ok. It's nothing superrr amazing but Leo and Kate's relationship is really amusing! Someone should give Baron his own show... he's a real treasure! I started watching this because of Sarah Shahi looked to be worth watching and I was right but maybe she needs better material
5,Good Series to Watch,I caught just a few episodes on the TV and really enjoyed it so I wanted to catch up on the entire season.
4,Fairly Legal Season One,It was different from alot of shows and Sarah Shahi's acting was really goodFairly Legal Season One I would recommend
4,Color Not Guaranteed,"This is a well made gown and am very happy with the purchase. Based on the picture used to describe the gown, I thought I was going to receive a BLUE gown but instead ended up with a PINK one. For that I had to give it 4 stars instead of 5."
5,Porcupine Tree - Coma Divine (2 CDs),The Porcupine Tree shows the excellent work on this album the band on stage also. High quality recording and flawless presentation. This version with two remastered CDs and only came to appreciate the work. I already had the version with only one CD and I am extremely pleased with the exchange. The version with a booklet DigiBook beautiful and well done also values ''the work. The band's fans can not fail to have Coma Divine. Very good!
5,PHENOMENON - PHILODENDRON,"One of the best live recordings that i've heard in a long time.A painting of sounds that just want to make you create your own work of art. If this band was to be given the production that Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes, were given they would blow them away. Pure Narcotic with a twist of lemon and a shot of tequila. Buy it and support real talent."
3,Not Really a Facsimile Edition,"The Harvard 1964 paperback ""facsimile"" edition of 1st, 1859, edition of Origin [ISBN 0-674-63752-6(pbk)]is not really a FACSIMILE. It retains pagination of original but does NOT reproduce drawings, diagrams, or footnotes."
2,Poor Format,"The book itself isn't going to change- this isn't a review of the contents, but of how they are presented in this book. Since it is a 'facsimile' of the first edition (written in bold yellow on the spine) it is the same- page numbers, language, everything. What I found immediately odd was that the text is centered into a small portion, there is at least an inch all the way around of blank paper. Leading me to the conclusion that the book could be of smaller dimension. Also the binding seems to be too tight (this may just be my copy). The book doesn't lay flat, it opens up toward the outside, as if it needs more space. It kind of looks like a well worn paperback, but this is a hardcover. Also, because of the tightness, it's hard to read. The book always wants to close on me, quite a lot of pressure is needed to keep it open. I bought a different book and will be donating this copy."
5,Kirby Bags,"Great price for 15 bags!! In my city, I would have paid $10.00 for 3, that is like getting 6 bags for free. Shipped in a timely fashion."
1,Not Genuine,"I have been using my Kirby for 10 years. I was even a Kirby sales person for a short time. I received my bags and immediately realized there were made differently. they are not the fibrous material that my previous ""micron Magic"" bags were made with. They are paper on the outside and a thin layer of filter on the inside. I bought a large order and I am returning them all. The very reason I have the Kirby is for my kids allergies and Asthma. Without the true hepa filtration, I may as well throw dust in the air. These should be removed since they certainly appear to be falsely represented."
5,Unreal!,"This is without a doubt one of the finest pieces of sound art I have ever heard. Andrew Chalk is the only artist I know of who is on par with the Hafler Trio when it comes to producing mind-bending drone ""music"". There is no way to describe this ""music"" but if your a fan of other drone/sound artists such as Hafler Trio, Nurse With Wound, Organum, Mirror etc. get this while you can."
1,Want a challenge?,"This book was a pretty tough read, and most of the concepts about women starting out in medicine were fairly obvious. Some things, though, were new to me. I did not, however, learn enough to really give this book a lot of credit. It would have been easier to just look this particular subject up on the web or in an encyclopedia. Enjoy!"
4,Pretty good.,"The only thing I don't really like about this book is the categorization. It discusses Napoleon, then skips to the industrial revolution, but then comes back to Napoleon again and the Bourbon restoration. In my opinion, history books should follow the chronology of history, and include everything from one time period in one section."
5,AMAZING.,"This lube works great! It's healthy and can be used with condoms since it's water based. The viscosity is good (a little lighter than hair gel), and it lasts a decent amount of time. It also doesn't feel grimy. Love it. ;)"
2,Meh,"I only purchased this because a friend suggested it. I now have a bone to pick with them..Pro:Pump bottle?! Heck yea~No odor!No Dyes.Works great at first.Gel-ish. Doesn't drip easilyCon:Because its first ingredient is water, it evaporates and leaves everything else behind Very quickly.Not Pretty! Peels and pills like white glue. So not sexy..I suppose if you keep a bowl of water next to you to keep rehydrating this product... it would work...."
2,Not good with toys,"I got this lube because my Fleshlight requires a water-based lubricant, and the reviews made this look promising. While it does take a long while to dry up, unfortunately it just doesn't provide the same amount of lubrication as other lubes I've tried, like Wet and Astroglide. I've yet to try it out with a partner, but I'm going to have to find something else to use with my toy."
1,Sticky,"I ordered this because it was so highly rated, but I find it unbearably sticky. I'm looking elsewhere for a water-based lube."
2,Meh.,"Dry and sticky at the same time, like glue. I'm glad I haven't had to bust this out with a partner. Bad container causes build up on the pump. Once using, I find a little spit keeps it from becoming so sticky. My search for a great affordable lube does not stop here."
3,Same as Others,"Like all water based lubes, this dries out quickly. For a male personal lubricant, I would get a different product."
2,"It's OK, but just that","It's got a good viscosity, but if you use it for a while like an ""edging"" excercise, your tool of choice sort of gets a feeling of maybe being in the water for 12 hours...sorta weird, not like any other lube I've tried."
3,similar to KY,I think this lube is suitable for tight b... and so bad for loose one.my wife did not like it
3,"Slick, but a little painful","My partner and I purchased this lube intending to use it for anal sex. It is a very slick, high-quality lube. The only problem with it is that both my partner and I feel pain when using it. It burns a little for my partner, but he says that it's not too bad, but I really can't use this lube without excessive amounts of pain,which is too bad because it is very lubricating. So be careful."
2,Unusable for anal (for me)!!,"While this lube may work fine for you, I found it to be unusable anally. I experienced a burning sensation when I applied it, rendering completely unusable. The reason I purchased this lube was because of its good reputation for anal, so it was a shame I could not use it. If you think you might be sensitive to parabens (which I have determined as the cause of the discomfort), I would suggest trying a different brand. ID glide gave me no problems."
5,Best I've used,"This product is excellent if you're looking for something thicker and longer lasting than what you've used. I've read the reviews that claim it can be gummy, but at least for my use (anal) that hasn't been the case. It has cleaned up easily and has allowed for larger toys to enter more easily than lubes I've used in the past.If I can answer any questions, let me know because I highly recommend this over the many other brands out there."
5,Product is the very best I ever used,"It is very slick, not oily, water based and lubricates without running .And not messy at all.Highly recommend !!!!!"
1,I Suppose it Depends What You Use it For,I don’t understand all the other reviews on here unless I just got a bad batch. If you get it anywhere where other than where your body is helping in the moisture process it gets sticky pretty fast. Not only that it kind of balls up in to a soft gel type substance. Gross and a not a mess I want to deal with and defiantly not sexy. I like trying new things but I’ll be going back to Liquid Silk. Look it up and thank me later. ;)
1,Burning love...ew.,"This is a terrible lube. The parabens in it cause bad burning sensation, and it's far too expensive for such a bad product. Try Sliquid's Sassy or Gel formula instead!"
5,Great product,"Great product, very good quality stainless steel plate and moat. Plate is removable so it's very easy to clean and maintain. Now I won't have to deal with those pesky ants anymore! Little River Pet Shop sent my order SUPER fast, would definitely buy from again. I'm a very satisfied customer, thank you very much indeed."
2,Wayne wst30 3/10 submersible pump,I purchased this product in august 2011 . For use in a pond . After six months of infrequent use it stopped working.
5,This C.D. is HOTT!!!!!,I Love Dru Hill and all of their song and this is their best song yet.....i love it!!!!!!!
1,BEST SONG IN MY LIFE . TOUCH MY HEART,I LIKE TO SAY TO DRU HILL THAT THIS SONG IS THE BEST SONG I LIKE SINCE THEY HAVE STARTED TO REALES ALBUMS.I WANT TO SAY GUYS KEEP IT UP YOU ARE PLAYING NICE MUSIC.I WISH YOU THE BEST
5,Robust and comfortable,"It's very comfortable, and strong enough. It does not creak or sway at all, whether I, a 170-pound person, sit on it or lie on it in the 'zero-gravity' posture. It's stable, so it's more comfortable.It may depend on your luck. My previous Faulker recliner, which was black paded, did creak.I would like to mention that the wooden armrests and blue jeans pad are more comfortable than plastic armrests and black pad. It's a little more expensive than the black padded one, but it is worthy of its price"
2,"Man, i thought it was cooler.","Dont be fooled, the box looks cool but you might be dissapointed with this toy. So be careful, i'd rather buy a set than this! But thanks for reading my review, i hope it helps. =)"
3,Mixed feelings,"I have somewhat mixed feelings about this book. Unlike other books by the author, this book is quite short and intended to be a workbook with a step-by-step guide.It also containts lots of worksheets to fill out. The ideas of cognitive behavior therapy are clearly presented, their possible applications are considered.That's for the positive side.On the negative side, there are too many references to other books. The book contains not enough actual demonstrations of cognitive therapy principles. I doubt whether clients without an accompanying (group) therapy can greatly benefit from this book.If you are looking for a real self-help book withoug being in therapy, I refer the reader to the book ""feeling good"" or ""the feeling good handbook"". If you are a client currently in therapy, then this book can be an interesting supplement."
3,this book is okay,i found this book to be just okay except for one thing. the charts are extremely helpful and i would buy the book knowing that in advance. i do recommend it but primarily for the charts and logs.
3,it could be better,"I as expecting a workbook that was much more user friendly. The questions are tedious, time-consuming, and not very clear to the reader."
2,Didn't work for me,"There were some insightful points about how I think negatively thus perpetuating my negative view of myself... but I just couldn't get into the exercises. Very specific, action-oriented exercises, but inner visualization works better for me. I think this book could work for some people; it just didn't for me."
5,Ten days to self esteem,"This is a great book. Large print makes for easy reading, work sheets for easy learning."
3,Ten days to self-esteem,"This book has a lot of repetetion material from his previous best seller ""feeling good: a new mood therapy"". I recommend buying the book ""feeling good"" instead of this one."
1,We all have off days,"Burns is terrific: see his Feeling Good books, but this is a crashing bore of no sustained interest.I would be interested to know if anyone bought it, worked it hard, and felt their self-esteem surge. My own thinking on self-esteem is much different than what's here (possible bias alert!) and I think since the model and thinking are less developed that the book is obsolete. No disrespect intended, but this one is like many junky self-help books."
3,I am sure it is good,I am sure this is a good book but there is quite a lot of work to be done. So I believe it is for only the serious readers who also want to be interactive because there are a lot of exercises in this book. I haven't started the exercise but it looks very good.
2,Not What I Had Hoped,"This book was recommended to me by a professional. For someone who struggles with depression and low self-esteem, I found the book difficult to trudge through. On several occasions, I found it condescending. I feel the most utilizable parts to this book are the Checklists, which I have found helpful in keeping track of how my depression and anxiety are/aren't improving. For this reason only do I give it two stars."
1,"An overly simplistic, childish approach","This book came to me from a highly educated and professional person. I was astonished as I tried to find my way through this. Dr. Burns treats this subject as if it were ""self-esteem for dummies"". Stick figures and bubble conversations to identify your feelings appear to be geared to children. It is almost as if the expectation is that well educated professional people don't have this problem. I tried several times to disregard this and plow through the book -- to no avail. The writing treats the subject much too lightly. I am appalled that a credible Dr would put something like this in the market! If I could give this less than a full star I would."
1,IS THIS A JOKE? IT'S NOT VERY FUNNY!,"Books like this one are very damaging to those who really suffer from low self-esteem. After reading it, they are even more discouraged because the book trivializes their problems and as well as the seriousness of low self-esteem. Anyone who truly understands what low self-esteem is, knows you cannot recover from it in a few days, weeks, or even months. This book should be for people who are merely temporarily or situationally discouraged--it really has nothing to do with self-esteem.I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE DR. BURNS WROTE THIS BOOK!"
5,The best short story collection I've yet encountered.,"Wolfe is rightly considered a master (if not THE master) of the science-fiction/fantasy novel, and yet I believe his greatest strength lies in writing short stories. This collection is his best. I've read collections by Borges, Tolstoy, Babel, Hemingway, Joyce, and on. This one tops them all, regardless of genre.Wolfe's writing is a miracle to behold. His characterizations are always disarming, and his language is unparalleled. Other reviews have given some clue as to the stories in this collection, which are all speculative and challenging. Although the concept is now overused, this would be the one book I would take with me to the desert island to read for pure pleasure."
4,"""The old woman closed the notebook...""","Amazing - thank you Frank! Somewhere between the best science fiction earthbound and DeLint's secrets inside of our cities ... is how Wolfe reads to me. When I smack into his funny twists of phrase and timing - the worlds lost - the technology overrunning - the psychosis - the human side of all the changes the world can imagine for itself. I stop still at some phrases: ""We are all sketches, as it were, of the same set of pastels."" 'Eyeflash Miracles', 'Seven American Nights' - and the circular patterns of Doctor Death / Death of Doctor Island... etc. I am hunting up more Wolfe for future reads."
4,A superb collection,"""The Island of Doctor Death and other stories,"" ""The Death of Doctor Island""; ""Tracking Song""; ""The Eyeflash Miracles""; ""Seven American Nights"" are all worth the price of the book alone. The only problem is I didn't get some stories like ""Paper Tigers"" or ""Three Fingers"". Aside from that I really enjoyed this collection."
4,Island doctors and their deaths,"These being the first short stories I've read by Gene Wolfe I went into the read curious, hopeful and genuinely unsure how they'd turn out. I'll be upfront w/my bias; I think Gene Wolfe is an amazing author.The good news: I'm even more impressed by his writing and stories than I was before.The bad news: Not every story is amazing; such is reading short fiction collections.Overall, I rate this as an excellent collection of short fiction, and unless you simply have an aversion to the fantastic, I would highly recommend it. And if you already like Gene Wolfe? Look for familiar devices, such as memory and sense perception. He winds such nice paths..."
1,What light adjustment?,"Let me start by saying I love Wiley X goggles and have been riding with them for a decade. Decided to spring for these light adjusting goggles to avoid having to switch out the dark lenses for clear when riding at night.Now for the bad, there's hardly any light adjustment from these lenses. Left them in direct sunlight for an extended period of time just in case and useless. They fade to a light gray and serve no purpose for someone who would be riding into direct sunlight at various times during the day.You can buy two sets of SG1's with both clear and dark lenses for the same price as this single set of what could be considered night time googles only. Then you'll have a set of each and spares for when the lenses get tore up after extended use. Don't waste your money here."
4,Book reveals life of Bruce & Brandon Lee,"This is a very well written book: straight to the point, with lots of interesting facts. This book also has pictures of Bruce & Brandon Lee (& others) that I had never seen before. A great book for fans of Bruce & Brandon Lee."
3,Nyko Wireless Headset Review,I was rather impressed by the idea of going full wireless with my Logitech Wireless Controller and Nyko Wireless headset for Xbox Live. WARNING: I could not use it unless I already had an Xbox live communicator. It will not connect unless it is plugged into the com part of the xbox communicator. Which means I had to spend an additional 30$ for a communicator. If you can get a cheap communicator then its definetely worth it.
2,Disappointed,"For the price, I expected more than I got. It works alright. The sound quality is as good as the headset that came free with the Xbox Live subscription. Too bad you can't keep the earpiece in your ear so you can hear it. The hook that holds it on your ear is so soft that the headset just flops around on the side of your head. You have to keep your head tilted to the side to keep it in your ear! Also, the rechargeable battery dies very fast. It's a good idea, not very well executed."
4,Good buy,"This is a quality product with the only caveat being that over time a larger dog (mine is 60 pounds -Alaskan sled) that lunges on the lead, even with an in-line spring attached, will break the snap. It took four months but it finally broke. I like the thin cable that is light for the dog to have to move. I'll still get them as a broken lead is no problem where I live."
3,It rub burned my leg!,"It worked well to keep my dog contained, but every time she ran past me and rubbed my legs with the cable, it burned my leg and left a black scar that lasted a long time!Please make sure your dog always has shelter and fresh water available at all times. Preferably, only use it for short periods of time and make sure your dog gets adequate exercise daily."
4,A walk down memory lane,"Like most people, this reviewer remembers Bing Crosby for his ""road"" movies with Bob Hope, a few other flicks, and the song ""White Christmas. I also remember Bing riding the Aqueduct Special ... better from Manhattan to Queens after he was a legend. However, apparently, Gary Giddins states that Bing was a very popular jazz singer during the 1920s and 1930s when non-Blacks were not just a rarity, but nonexistent in the music.This biography is very interesting as it provides insight into Bing before he becomes a Hollywood icon. This book is for more than just Hollywood buffs, as Jazz fans will enjoy Bing's influence on the entertainment industry with emphasis on his jazz days. This is a well-written biography that will add to a legendary American hero.Harriet Klausner"
3,"Bing Crosby, Pocketful of Dreams",600 pages packed with unnecessary trivia. Would have been much more interesting if this bio was boiled down into about 300 worthwhile pages.
4,sweet,"this item has become a old school thing can be used for all types of things, but dose music great...."
3,Good Product,"It took a little bit to get it to work with my Motorola V551, I had to install the software twice, install the drive twice, then it finally worked.It is nice to be able to make your own ringtones and wallpapers to upload to the phone and edit the address book by actually typing!I would have gave it 5 stars but for the difficulty in installing."
1,False advertising,Does not work with V300. V323/V330 were the closest but neither worked for me. No drivers for Win7. Wasted my money.
4,Works as advertised,Works as advertised. You will have to go to the vendor website to get upgrades depending on your cell phone model. There are some ringtones and graphics included on the CD with the software which was a pleasant suprise.
1,Just call me easy money!,"From now on I promise I will read the reviews before buying the advertisements... My new MA-8860C cable arrived about noon today. It is 10:30pm and still no data transfered. Okay, maybe it's me. It surely isn't my Motorola v300, my new Dell computer, or the fact that I've been working with computers for the past 15 years! I agree with the other reviewer who says spend a little extra and save! This product does not support Motorola v300."
3,"Nice, but disappointing","Several reviews have noted that the interpretation here is feminine. I might suggest another way of saying this is she doesn't play with authority. Certainly, parts are meant to be delicate, but there are parts which are much more successful played with some force. Granted, this may be a matter of taste, but the music doesn't grab me here where it does in the Gould and Perahia CDs. It's almost as if she is playing the music but isn't really into it. My wife, a Bach nut, didn't immediately recognize it, which is extremely unusual and telling. She is one who comes up with a BWV number after hearing about eight bars.To my ears the engineering leaves something to be desired, not bad, but I found myself wondering if something was wrong with my system. There is very little presence.So, one star off for the interpretation/playing and one star off for the recording quality.Disappointingly, this CD likely won't be seeing much play in my house/auto."
2,THIS ALBUM HAS NO AFFILIATION WITH HUMSTING RECORDS,THIS ALBUM HAS NO ABSOLUTELY AFFILIATION WITH HUMSTING RECORDS!!!
5,what i've been waiting for,"This is a great CD. I love Filter's music. Take A Picture is the best song that that I have heard in years. You really need to buy this if you are looking for quality. No need to look elsewhere, Filter is wonderful!"
5,Great song,"This is a great song.The lead singer's voice finds its way perfectly through a beautiful haze of guitars,percussion,and synthesizer."
4,Funny.,A very listenable dittie. I found myself humming the tune over and over again. That's what convinced me that I really liked the song.
1,$11 for ONE ROLL OF FLOOS,"First, my bad for assuming that no way can someone charge $11 for A SINGLE ROLL of floss. I was mistaken.So, this is $11 for ONE ROLL OF FLOSS. be warned."
3,Not for everyone,"This book might be a fun and interesting read for the general buyer, but if you truly want to learn about what Hasidic life is like, it won't help you much. The author is not an Orthodox Jew, and the finished book just doesn't have much insight into the reality of the life. I do give it credit for including lots of extra basic information to educate the non-Jewish reader."
4,Holy Days: The World of the Hasidic Family,The book was interesting but the vocabulary was above my understanding. This does not include theHebrew words. I also found the history confusing. Overhall it was a learning piece. The focus was on this onefamily and the history of Hasidim.
5,There's a FIFTH book in the series!,"Zack Emerson (actually Ellen Emerson White) is one of the finest young adult author's around. What a realistic view of Vietnam! Her gritty style makes you care about the characters...and guess what? THERE IS A SEQUEL/COMPANION BOOK TO THIS SERIES! ""The Road Home"", written as Ellen Emerson White continues the saga of ECHO COMPANY. If you loved this series like I did, I'm sure you'll be thrilled to read more. White ties up a lot of loose ends with this 450 page novel!"
5,This book Ruled!! I've read it about 6 times already,"This book was the best. I got to copies of it, one I keep for myself, and the other i let my friends barrow so they have read it, this book ruled, But I had no idea on tell I looked up the author that it was the 4th part of aserios, I must have the first 3 parts!!!"
4,A Tiny Book of Valuable Information,"It is a small volume of explanations to successful breadmaking from an owner of a Provencal bakery, written by an adept enthusiast. The author is witty and the baker is skillful and sharing. Along with useful breadmaking customs are anecdotes on origins, for example, the invention of croissants. Also included are cultural beliefs. A brief lesson in bread-related French words could also be obtained. It concludes with a wine suggestion for each type of bread. The recipes are easy to follow. A lot of practice might be required for best results and this little book proves handy."
3,Small n Tasty,"This small, compact book offers a bit of everything - it's a travel log, a recipe book, and an inside view of a family business. The topic of breadmaking is interesting and the opening chapters are especially fun to read because of Mayle's descriptions. The book feels 'warm' and inviting, even if you don't necessarily want to bake bread. The first few chapters are an introduction to cafe Auzet and the Auzet family, and the subsequent chapters include ways to recreate their famous loaves. The book also includes a chapter on choosing the appropriate wine for each bread type. The book was an easy and quick read. I miss Mayle's travel-fiction work and, although the book is cute, it doesn't have broad appeal."
2,Buy it only as a gift,"Peter Mayle's ""Confessions of a French Baker,"" is a slim, cute little book that spans 89 pages and with its compact pages, extremely wide margins, and larger typeface can easily be read from cover to cover within 10 - 15 pages (and no, i'm not exaggerating).While the title of this book suggests deep insight into the secret methodology of a world-class French bakery what Mayle provides is an extremely limited and basic examination of Gerard Auzet's boulangerie - Chet Auzet. While this book does provide a handful of bread recipes and suggested wine pairings for particular style of loaves - the actual narrative content could easily be crammed into a pamphlet.This book will certainly appeal to fans of Mayle as well as Francophiles or bread/bakery afficionados and due to its elegant design would be well suited as a gift item as well. If you are puchasing for yourself in hopes of gaining further insight into baking technique you may be somewhat disappointed however."
4,"LIGHT, PLEASANT READING",PETER MAYLE TAKES A FUN SUBJECT AND TREATS IT WITH FLAIR OF JOY AND HUMOR. YOU ARE TRANSPORTED TO FRANCE ON A LIGHTHEARTED TRIP. EVERY PAGE CONTINUES THE JOURNEY MAKING YOU WANT TO TURN THE PAGE.
3,Good but Great Deceiver much better.,"This set suffers both from being too short AND a good chunk of the material being nearly (if not completely) identical to the tracks on Starless and Bible Black, trimming the value of this set down to the wonderful Lark's tongues pieces alone.If you have the great deceiver set there is of course no reason at all to purchase this set--however given the price and very limited availability, you might be stuck with this rather luke warm effort. On the other hand, my 3/5 rating isn't for quality which is of course outstanding but for the faults (short length, repitition of material) which keep this from being a 5/5."
4,"i love KC, but but but...","Starless And Bible Black has always been one of the KC albums I appreciated the least (not sure why), so that would explain why I don't like this as much as many others (a great deal of the 2-disc set is from that album). But get it if you dig KC, particularly this era. Good stuff, just not as good as B'Boom or Thrakattak (heh)"
3,More of the same from live Crimson set.,"Do we really need yet another example of the live power of this particular Crimson lineup? The Great Deceiver box set pretty much covered it all. It's not that this particular performance isn't as strong as the others, but another live CD set of mostly similar material merely makes it all redundant. Crimson heads would much rather have a digitally remastered, sonically enhanced CD of Earthbound. Or BBC performances of the various Crimson lineups. But please, Mr. Fripp, no more live CDs of this lineup. It's not that we don't love it, but we've heard it already."
2,Tabs are small,I bought these tabs to replace a zipper tab that had broken in the washing machine on a hooded sweatshirt. They appear much bigger than they are. I was unable to use them. Too small and flimsy.
1,Dritz Zipper Replacement,Too small for much of anything. Over priced for product use. Perhaps my own fault. Should have paid more attention to description.
1,Not what I expected,"I returned these because they are not ""heavy duty"". The only thing I might use them on is a baby garment. Not at all what I expected."
3,average,Given the price I paid I feel quality was sub par. I understand that everybody has to make money but they were alot cheap than in quality department than I expected.
5,Celentano Artista!,"Yes, it is another Celentano classic, created during his golden years of collaboration with Toto Cutugno between 1977 and 1980. Coming on the heels of his brilliant album 'Soli', Celentano captured his fans' hearts with a number of hits, such as the title song ""Un Po' Artista Un Po' No"" with great pace shifts and trademarked voice. Fast ""L'orologia"" is a great track to dance or just listen to. I personally liked ""Il Tempo Se Ne Va"" - it should be included in every compilation of his music. And ""Se Non E Amore"" flows in the same rythm with others, creating a feeling of concept album even though it is not."
4,Vistas Book,These vistas book was good in price and helpful in the class room as well. Where everyone in my class spend $280 for there book I paid $23 for my book. In all this book was good in price and to study from. I would tell my friends and classmates that if that need books try amazon before you go to somewhere.
2,Frustration,"The book in itself is fine for learning. The issues I am coming up with are the online applications for the book. Not only do you have to have the supersite code, but you also have to have a WebSam code as well. They just keep charging and charging...."
2,Scum Publisher....,"Do we really need a ""revised"" book for introductory Spanish every year? What are the revolutionary changes that are happening in the language that require American high school/college kids to take notice? Last time I checked, the past and future tense aren't being changed often.Additionally, does the 200 dollar price tag justify a group of generally ridiculous on-line exercises? And here, I thought the technological advertising gimmick of a CD+Website had died in the late 90s, after it was proven utterly worthless.This book is bought on the back of poor students for around 200 dollars, and is obsolete as soon as the purchase is completed. I will be recouping about 10% of the original purchase price, which only highlights the massive profit that the publisher must make from pillaging student's savings accounts."
1,Do not buy used!,"Don't buy this book used. To use this book you need an online code that costs 50.00, if you buy used you don't get the code. It's a total rip off. Book basically refers you to the webpage for instructions and class lessons, book is waste of time. Teachers that assign this book are sadistic."
3,Great but incredibly buggy--our class dropped the online part for grading,"After paying a GAULING 150$ for this book, I would have to say that first impressions were not too good. Over the first few chapters I came to appreciate the quality of the material. It is interesting and quite complete. I actually enjoy the textbook as well as the videos.The online component is another matter. The servers are OFTEN OVERLOADED while you are trying to get homework done for a deadline. In addition, the online grading is POOR. No one took the time to carefully create multiple alternative answers to sentences.For 150$ the online material is brutally not ready for primetime. My instructor made all the graded material credit/no credit because it was so unreliable."
3,Good but at a hidden price.,Good book to learn Spanish in college from. Annoying if you buy it online that you have to pay an extra 50 bucks for the online text.
2,This one is only in spanish?,"I think you should list your product inVistas, 4th Editionbetter explain... I speak english and need to lern spanish so. I do need the spanish version but with englis explanations... Also, what about the codes for the supersite or the workbook? Specify! I would need a used one its cheaper and sometimes its better than the new ones! Because someone took the time to make notes that will help a fellow lernerBetter buy from.Vistas, 4th Edition"
3,VISTAS,"I am happy that Stephen Carr mailed the book I purchased in time for my son to have it for school. The only thing that we did not know is the fact that the book had a passcode, which was already used by Stephen, therefore my son could not utilize it in order to complete his online assignments. We had to spend additional money to purchase a passcode for my son to do his online assignments. It would have been helpful to know that piece of information during the time of purchase."
2,Internet code not included with book listed under NEW!,"Bought book listed under NEW. NEW books include a code for the internet portion of the class. Seller did state book was paper back with three hole punch but no mention that code not included - all used books stated whether included or not. Price was less than other new, but thought I was paying less for the style of book, not missing code. Seller offered return if unopened, but we had to open to find that code was not included."
2,confused,did not meet the requirements for my online class therefore i had to driop with no cdrom it was an oversight on my part i guess
1,Wrong book,"The book was purchased assuming it was the same as the ISBN, I put into the search. It was not. It was also labled as near new, but showed considerable wear and highlights."
3,Caveat Emptor - Know What You're Buying,"This version of the book includes the textbook and the ""supersite"" code. Used editions of the book usually DO NOT INCLUDE the website code. If you purchase a used copy of the book, you can choose to purchase the code separately. The supersite code is now $69 at the publisher's website ([...]), which is the only place to buy it.If your instructor requires it, a WebSAM upgrade costs an additional $50 beyond the price of the supersite code and is available at the publisher's website above. (Note, the version of the textbook on the publisher's site that includes the WebSAM code is actually $6.40 more expensive than buying the regular book and buying the upgrade separately.)"
1,Worst textbook in 6 years of college,"This textbook is the new way schools are trying to farm out language studies instead of paying teachers to teach. My class was guided by a TA and all learning was to be taught via the horrible book and even more atrocious online curriculum. The homework is online and well over half the time you type in the correct word, it will tell you you got it wrong creating an unbelievably confusing situation. My class of 30 was down to 11 with 3 weeks left in the semester. It is also designed so that you can't return it. The book come with a pass code that can only be used once thus making your book useless at the end of the semester unless you buy a new passcode. My school ripped me off $170 for this piece of garbage and offered me $5 for it back."
1,DON'T BUY USED!!!!,I purchased Vistas 3rd Edition used for my Spanish Class I take at college. What I didn't know is that the book comes with a website that you need to use--the book is not complete without it. Apparently once the password that comes with the book is used it can't be used again. So you need to purchase an additional password. It is not worth the money!!! My advice is to just buy the book new and don't waste your time and money. I am very disappointed with the whole experience of getting this book.
4,I like it,This is a good product. The book was almost new upon opening the package. This book does not include an access code. I would recommend others to buy.
5,Money Well Spent!,"The book was exactly what I needed and I was surprised by how quickly it arrived. It has been a handy, hardcover text for my online class. Thanks!"
3,Ok,I wish I would have known it didnt come with the codes i need to do my homework i had to pay twice as much for the book and the codes i should have just bought it new and the bookstore.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"The publisher sells the book with an access code for less. Don't buy it here. ESPECIALLY DO NOT BUY IT USED!! A new access code for the book is $80, and you can buy the book new with an access code for $154.80 at the publishers website, less than what a used book and new access code will cost you.DON'T GET BURNED, AND DON'T BUY THIS BOOK HERE!!!"
4,Great tebook; bad website!,"This textbook (and its supplemental materials) are required for my Spanish 1 course at The Evergreen State College. The book and workbook are written clearly and easy to understand. However, I've heard enough from my classmates to agree with ""A Customer."" It would be better to buy this textbook as a set from the website [...] or from your university bookstore. Also the website doubles as a study/assignment center but the site is still being worked on so if you have problems, find another computer!"
3,"tips for buying this book, and other books in general.","This book is ok. The only useful material in it ate the sections titled ""estructura"". Now, for buying the book. Do not purchase this book brand new. Ever. In fact, you should never buy a book brand new. When you sell it back, it does not matter how many people have owned it. For this book specifically, I can tell you that a guy who sat next to me had the 3rd edition and the only difference is that about 3/4 of the way through the page numbering goes off. Most classes don't require you to use the dvds and extra crap; however, you will most likely need the online homework component. Here is what you should do: buy the online code either from your bookstore or directly from the vhl site and then look for the 3rd edition on the Amazon marketplace. You can usually find old edition for 75."
1,hIGHWAY rOBBERY,"This is by far the worst fleecing I have ever experienced as a student. I suppose math and science majors are used to this type of extortion, but as a history major this was the first textbook that made me seriously consider dropping the class, ne, dropping out of college. this college textbook racket has existed for decades and until the student and professors work together to stop this mindless price gouging, then it will continue to be that way. Would you ever pay over 100 dollars for a dvd? A cd? a spanish book? I wonder if the scumbags who publish this book sleep well at night. Well, maybe if there's a God he'll allow these pirates to pass this mortal coil from the safety of sleep, cause if I ever meet one...boy howdy."
4,Amazing Mud mask,it's really good. It minimizes your pores instantly. it is pricey but I got it cheaper at marshalls for only 12.99
3,Meh not that great....,"Well I would like to say this Flute is good for beginners it plays OK once warmed up. I have noticed a horrible smell coming from the case and flute it smells like gasoline. The mouth piece is already showing signs of the ""sliver"" rubbing off, and there where tiny scratch's along the body. The Case doesn't hold the flute tightly it moves around inside, which will cause damage. I will be returning it which is a shame :( I decided to play again after 8 years if it wasn't for that smell I would keep it."
2,No carrying handle,Two issues:1. No handle on the carrying case - I cannot believe someone actually designed this! How would a kid carry this around?2. My daughter also complained that the high notes were much harder to produce compared to the more expensive rental flute she used for 2 years - we switched to the Signature Music 2810N Closed 16-hole Flute (it HAS the handle on the carrying case). Now she is happy (at least for now)
4,Perfect for my daugth,My daugth it's happy whit this item. Perfect sound and very easy to play.Something problem with the brushed in the bottom.
1,awful,"After a few weeks of band practice my daughter was still having a hard time getting a good sound out of this flute. Then it needed what seemed like a small repair, one of the keys wasn't coming back up the way it should, so I asked the music repair guy at my daughter's school to do the repair, and he told me the case is worth more than the flute itself and that she would probably get so frustrated trying to learn to play on this instrument that she would end up giving up. According to him a ""good"" (not top of the line) flute would cost between $750 and $950, but luckily most of these places sell used ones for between $350 and $450, so I guess the lesson here is that you get what you pay for! which in this case was a total waste of money."
1,a few thoughts about buying a flute...,"I just wanted to say that the only way to buy a new instrument if you are not an expert, is to research thoroughly the matter. I have been playing the flute for over 40 years and the following website, (not mine) is one of the most helpful, down to earth, with thorough information I have seen yet. ( I am always on the lookout for a good flute!) So check this site out[...]"
4,Good product for the price,"My daughter owned a Yamaha student flute (which she lost). Not wanting to pay that kind of money again, I searched and searched the internet for a better deal than this. Silver plated, great sound, and overall quality for the price makes this a great deal."
5,Great experience!,"This is one of the best purchases of musical instruments I've made in a long time. From the very beginning, I contacted The Instrument Store with some questions. The customer service was nothing short of immaculate. They answered all my questions with professionalism, friendliness, and respect. The flute came promptly, and I had no problems. The flute was exactly what I was looking for. Plays and sounds GREAT! I highly recommend this flute and the Instrument Store!"
3,Interesting read,"Having read Blackwater, I bought this book eagerly. I enjoyed it, but the fact that this is an early work shines through. Some of the plot structure seemed clumsy, although it was not clear to me whether this was the fault of the translation. I was not keen on Torsson's side-kick - he was a very immature character and deserved a good slap at times!!!However, the north of Sweden and the land of the Arctic Circle is a fascinating location for a crime novel. The story is engrossing and different and I doubt any reader will be overly disappointed. If you are a fan of the author, you will find the development of her skills quite fascinating - nearly 30 years separates this novel and Blackwater. I for one am intrigued and want to read more of this author - let us hope she is translated more often."
4,interesting tale,"A man is dead and the police are called in to investigate a small isolated Lapland community. The police have to use all their wits to sift through the information they are given from the local people and come to their conclusion. All the locals have something or someone to hide.It is a very atmospheric novel, with the scent of the birches as glaring as the crunch of snow underfoot. Great to read snuggled up somewhere warm!"
3,Interesting Read,"There is no doubt that Ekman is adept at creating a simple-but-intricate story, but much of the strength of the novel harbours within the exoticism of its characters and Sweden. Her style epitomizes the ""more is less"" saying, infusing degrees of complexity in seemingly simple prose that warrants a second read. The novel is richly atmospheric, invoking Sweden and its coldness in relation to the characters; however, the characters are not as well developed as to make the reader care too much about the dead young man, Matti, nor any of the other characters (perhaps with the exception of David, the artist, whose witty lines are some of the highlights of the novel). Not a flawless read, but probably worth a read when the weather's cold and you're snuggling under some blankets."
2,Don't Get Excited Over This...,"Contrary to the other reviews I browsed, I did not find this book particularly exciting. And I found the ending somewhat anti-climatic.I bought it with the hope it would be better. I told my husband not to waste his time reading it."
4,"Ninjas and Superspies, oh my!","The game Ninjas and Superspies by Palladium Books is one of the most fun games I've ever played. The system is fast and easy to learn, but can take some time to truly master. The character types can be used for almost any Spy or Martial Arts type game. The characters can choose from over 40 martial arts, each with it's own moves and subtle differences. Overall, a very enjoyable game, especially if combined with Mystic China, also by Palladium Books."
4,Kung Fu Fighting,"This is one of the must have splat books if you want to play Rifts, or any palladium game. The different fighting styles are a blast.The game itself is quite nice for its time, the only problem is the lack of actual ""gizmos"" and the question ""Who'd want to be james bond when you can be a ninja?"""
2,Old,Not tremendously helpful...outdated and too simplified. I would not recommend this to another twin survivor for purchase. I have found other resources much more helpful in my fight to understand the impact of losing a twin sister to death.
2,In need of an update and better graphics,"The material is a bit dated. Can you say Two Forks dam~! I was greatly disappointed in the minimal discussion on the specific sections of the river. His discussion on the flies and such was quite good, but I really wanted something with a bit more depth talking about the various stretches and the different type of entomology."
2,Buy latest model with 20GB disk,This one is old model. iRiver has already released new model with 20GB harddisk. Do not buy this one.
3,Beware new Nutrition Facts - Sodium Content Has Changed,"I love this broth. I just ran out and purchased a new supply. I happen to re-read the nutrition lable and discovered that the sodium content has gone from 54 mg (2% daily) to 430 mg (18% daily). If you use this because of the low sodium content, please be aware"
5,love it with pan fried potatoes,"We eat this often as a seasoning on pan fried potatoes, as well as other dishes. Love it."
4,"Morga not available, so we are hoping for next best.....","My vegetarian wife has used Morga Vegetable Broth for years. But suddenly it disappeared and no easily accessible shop seems to carry it anymore. Your product item, Seitenbacher, seemed to be similar and we were hoping better - however, we're Morga nuts, and pretty hard to satisfy!"
4,Tastes good and helps for Gluten free cooking,Handy to keep around as a seasoning for gluten free cooking-a littl saltier than I would prefer.
5,Vegetable soup flavoring,"This is a really super flavor, and a totally different addition to most any dish."
5,Delicious for Many Soups!,"I use this soup base for several of my vegetable soup recipes. It is particularly awesome for chickenless chicken soup. You add it and magic happens! If you find your soups lacking flavor, here is the answer!"
5,Suer Yummy broth,"My family loves this stuff. I use this in just about all of my cooking its a great base for many things(rice, soups, stews, omlets, beans, herb bread, sandwich seasoning popcorn seasoning etc). I visit two different grocery stores (my fav. Gorcery store does not carry it) just to buy this stuff. Also great to take camping. Also last for a long time considering how often I use it."
3,De Gustebus Non Disputandum Est,Food products are a matter of taste.I do not acare for this rather salty product.It is better thanyour off the shelf grocery item but I will not be purchasing it again.I gave away as much as I could
2,Beware of high sodium!,"The product information misses the following important piece of information - the high sodium content in this product. According to the information on the can, 1 tbs contains 420 mg of sodium, which is equivalent to 17% of the recommended daily value. Note that 1 tbs is actually very little, and most people would end up using more than that."
3,"serviceable, but there are better out there.","I use a lot of veggie broth powder as a staple of my cooking, and love being able to buy several jars at once here on Amazon. Sadly, the last time I came for broth my favorite brand (Rapunzel) was out of stock, with no ETA on offering it again. I bought the Seitenbacher sight unseen as it were (have never seen it offered locally so I couldn't taste test) based on all the positive reviews. I guess it's okay but frankly I don't like it as much. It doesn't dissolve as easily and the flavor is pretty drab in my opinion. Fortunately [sic] I have to use a lot more of it to even get a flavor so I'll be done with this case before too long. It's certainly better than MSG-ridden fakes and would be very handy to have if one is allergic to many things, being an entirely *acceptable* vegetarian broth. But barring necessity, I would not choose this one first."
3,Good IF....,"This has the reputation of being a great product. Maybe it is. But it doesn't come with any useful instructions, so unless you know someone who is willing to teach you how to use it, it's pretty much useless. I own it and understand that its use is very simple. But I have to say, it hasn't been any use to me. A few instructions might solve this problem, but sadly they are lacking. A common problem with computer applications and equipment."
4,DISKWARRIOR 4.0 WDD105,"WORKS WONDERS ON THE DIRECTORY REBUILD.ONLY SHORT COMING SO FAR IS PROBLEMS RE-MOUNTING ONE DRIVE OF 7WORKED ON, PROBLEM NOT FIXED HAD TO RE-INSTALL OS X 10.5"
5,Great Recovery Tool,Great recovery tool for mac computers. Recovers data by creating a disc image file of the erased disc. More reliable with complete recovery without effecting individual files. Slick.
1,Didn't Work For Me.,"Didn't Work. Disk Unavailable on desktop, No? Really? That's what the problem that this program was supposed to fix.If i were you u, take it to a professional."
5,DiskWarrior,DiskWarrior keeps my hard drives running smoothly and prevents potential problems. I highly reccomend it.
2,Nothing Accomplished,"DiskWarrior failed to find anything that I was looking for on my amnesiac software RAID array. Data Rescue 3 proved to be far, far more useful. DiskWarrior promised the moon and delivered nothing. A waste of $90."
1,Don't bother if HD fried,"DW could not repair my HD. The only thing it did was show some of my files were still present on the HD. Took a long time to determine inability to repair and was not very user-friendly in the process of repair/scanning, perhaps because it's not designed well to id why it can't repair a HD. I ended up buying a new HD (wish I saved the $ spent on DW) and moving my old files to it using my HD enclosure."
2,TIGER=5 STARS / LEOPARD = 0 STARS AVG=2.5,"When my Powerbook was running Apple's Tiger O/S, Disk Warrior was my best friend and rescued me from two near-fatal hardware issues. However, when I upgraded to Leopard and experienced issues from the gate, I figured Disk Warrior would remedy the situation. First off, it didn't and secondly, it made things worse. My permissions were so corrupt that I couldn't overwrite existing files. Adobe InDesign would crash repeatedly, Photoshop would not save any of the actions I created, my Address book wouldn't allow me to add or edit entries, Apple Keynote would not allow me to import images and Mail stopped remembering sender addresses for future autofill. I finally had to wipe my entire hard drive and clean install Leopard. Everything is running fine now.Bottom line, DO NOT USE DISK WARRIOR 4 WITH LEOPARD UNTIL ALSOFT RELEASES AN UPDATE - even though their website claims that it will work if you boot from the CD (which is what I did)"
4,"Slow, but does the job","Disk Warrior operates meticulously but very slowly to recover damaged disk directories. It was able to rescue data from a crashed 120 Gb external hard drive of mine. Once I figured out the options, and gave it an overnight task (7 hours!) to do, it accomplished it very effectively."
3,I expected more,"So I pay $100 for a software, comes in a cheap box and even the cd/dvd is cheap, it's one of those u buy at a retailer and burn ( with the blue area ). I was pretty disappointed that it looks as if someone made it in his mom's basement.Then insalling it, everything fine.. but again I feel disappointed, it felt empty.. I thought it would do a lot more than what it did, I feel that it does not do enough to be worth $100. Does it do the job right ? I have no idea, I can't really tell much difference on my laptop."
1,"Is this version 4, or version 3?",Nothing on this page indicates whether the product being sold here is version 3 or version 4. Which is it?
3,some funtional issues,"I ordered this banjo as a gift last year, 12/2011. It arrived quickly, but was missing the bridge and the tools to tune the thing. Amazon did give me a credit for a portion of the purchase price for the inconvinece, but I still had work to do. I contacted the company directly, they kindly sent the missing pieces free of charge. The banjo was ""set up"" for playing by an experienced banjo enthusiast only to find out that the 5th string peg would not hold, causing the 5 string to slack. I was dismayed that a $200 + banjo could not have been manufactured and sent out without multiple issues. I ended up sending the banjo to Dean to have the 5th string peg fixed, they could not have been nicer about helping me. Now there is a buzzing on the 3rd string, due to the construction of the banjo neck. This is a nice banjo overall, especially for a beginner. Too bad Dean does not have better quality control on the manufacturing line."
5,very good and inspiring stories,"i hope today's high school would teach material like this. no need to enforce exams on this subject. just enjoy some good story telling. when kids are young, these are great stories to read about. and more related to their daily life than reading anicient deceased people."
5,A must read!,"This is an important book for all women - from all walks of life. The most important message: Stay in control of your own destiny! And key to taking control is to have a clear understanding of who you are, what you have accomplished (or want to accomplish), and what strengths as well as weaknesses you possess. With such a clear view of oneself, and regardless of your life goals, this is the true strategy for success. Will you make a million? Maybe not - but the journey will be worth it! (Reviewed by Marion E. Gold - author of the ""Personal Publicity Planner: A Guide to Marketing YOU"" and ""TOP COPS: Profiles of Women in Command)"
4,good transaction,"Item arrived intact, on time and as described. I would order from this source again."
1,Don't buy this The rating doesn't accept a frowny face,"If you are interested in ""Strange New Religions,"" go down to your library and get the librarian to find you something scholarly on the religion of your interest. I spent several days annotating my copy with all the factual errors in it and then took it along to the Padre who was using it as a text book. Very intelligent man. The book was never used again."
3,Too light,"Great songwriting once again but, as this is not really my preferred genre, I feel the need of something darker. His first album gave me a bit of that and seemed a little more experimental. Albeit part of its charm was the amazing 'Oxygen', the kind of song that may along come around once in a while.I have nothing against this or him but it just seems to have lost a bit of edge. Perhaps I need to listen to it more."
4,Music like the soul of old Cape Cod,This album is cleaner and more refined than his debut. The lyrics are more mature and the songs are more melodic but manage to stay soulful and gritty. They also play a good live show and its only a matter of before they are the headliners. Willys deep voice is complimented by Nina Violets voice and viola. Its the soul of old Cape Cod. Every song on the album is good. Buy this album!
4,Love this,"We Can Be Strong is the reason I bought this CD. The rest of it will not disappoint. I heard the song on WFUV and every time it came on I would wonder who the artist was and try to get the name. I liked it so much, I tried to find it on line by typing in the lyrics I could remember. I even went to WFUV's website and looked at their current favorite cd list and tried to find it that way. That will give you an idea of how much I liked that song. I wouldn't have cared if it was the only one that was good on the cd, but far from it."
4,Good book on Periodization,"This is a very good book on strength training in that it relates specifically to many different sports. The only problem is that there are complicated terms, abbreviations, and vocabulary that are constantly used (with definitions and explanations upon first reference only). A glossary in the back would be a big help. Overall, this covers a lot of sport specific training methods which allows the reader to more or less pick and choose the best practices for his or her own training program. It's been a big help for me, although I recommend staying away from the plyometrics section."
4,A good resource,"This book is not for beginner's but is a good resource when considering how to train and a direction to take. It describes various methods of training, gives numerous examples and clearly shows that research was done. The author informs you of advantages and drawbacks of various training regimes. I refer back to this on a regular basis and I would recommend it highly."
2,So 1983 it hurts my eyes!,"I bought a used copy of this book from a library for 25 cents and that's about the right price for it. While Michael Maron undeniably had the technical know-how to wield his make-up tools, all makeovers are a clear proof that beauty is not only in the eye of the beholder but also highly dependent on the current era's view of beauty. Almost all ""after"" pictures are examples of strong, often garish 80's make up. My husband said, ""They look better in their before pictures!"" Besides, all pictures are black and white anyway so the effect of the color will be left to your imagination. Buy this book if you are into the 80's - it's not much use as a modern makeover tome."
3,Traveler's choice?,"I know that you can't expect a high quality set for just $100, but this was for my daughters (10 and 3) and thought it would be good. I used two of the larger for a trip recently. The suitcases were filthy and crushed considerably. On the return trip home, they came off the baggage claim a dingy grey and no longer lavender. So, they didn't take man handling very well.If you travel by car this would be great!! Otherwise, I was dissapointed in the quality."
5,Great Product. Set It and Forget It.,"I have used these for years. Many, many features that I do not use, but they are there if needed. Once setup they work great. I have only had to reset the configuration after a big lightning storm. Other than that it does a great job communicating over a exposed port on my router to the internet, back to my office a mile away. Allows me to remotely update and monitor the system. I have tried other lower price units, so far none have worked as well."
4,Excelent tradional music,I listened to this CD at a friend's house and find pure to the core and excellent for those interested in early african traditional singers. I highly recommend it.
4,Giving the Gift of Red Hot Monogamy,I gave this to a couple for their anniversary and they have said nothing but good things about it. The husband hasn't read it but has said that he is glad that his wife has.
5,Best Book on Intimacy I have read,"I saw Bill and Pam speak on Red Hot Monogamy at a Hearts at Home conference and consequently bought the book. I'm so glad I did. It is one of the best books on intimacy I have read. The Farrel's have a down-to-earth style of writing, that can make a sometimes difficult topic very readable and relatable.The book is filled with ""Red Hot Romance Ideas"" and has ""hands on"" homework at the end of each chapter making it a very practical read. I would highly recommend this resource to anyone who desires to have the title, ""Red Hot Monogamy"" be a descriptor of their marriage."
4,Spiritual Sexuality,"Bill and Pam Farrel believe that the most satisfying sex occurs in a monogamous, committed marriage. ""Red Hot Monogamy"" is written with Christian couples in mind. Sexuality and spirituality are intertwined in a unique way. This book is not just about sex it is more about developing a strong relationship that fosters intimacy. A lot of the ideas seem natural for newlyweds so reading this as a refresher course is a good option. There are over 200 creative romantic ideas and special sections for ""Hands-on Homework."" I liked the ideas about redecorating the bedroom to fit your fantasy location. Many of the ideas will also work for ""romance on a budget."" Making up code words, leaving secret notes and surprising your partner with romantic outings will make your love life hotter than before. I can recommend this book to Christian couples who are also interested in knowing what the Bible has to say about sexuality.~The Rebecca Review"
5,"Try the ""Hands-on Homework"" What fun!","My husband and I have been married for many years but learned A LOT from this book! I wish we'd had it when we were newlyweds. (It would make a great wedding shower gift)Bill and Pam Farrel know what they're talking about and share their knowledge with humor and encouragement. Red Hot Monogamy showed us how to relax, reconnect, and rediscover our romance!"
5,Red-Hot Monogamy: Making Your Marriage Sizzle,We used this book in our family and marriage class at church. It was such a wonderful opportunity to discuss intimate issues and God's blessing upon marital intimacy!!I would HIGHLY recommend this book to all Christian married couples!!
5,Great 60's music,Give credit where credit is due! Ignore the sarcastic remarks and put downs others have made of the group ( and show) and just listen. Some of the era's best songwriters wrote the songs and the Monkees performed better than they were ever given credit for.
2,Sound is way off,"Have to agree with some of the other reviewers. The main vocals sound flat, the background vocals are by far too prominent, and the whole things sounds badly remixed. I know the show was on eons ago, and my record player didn't necessarily get the best out of the albums, but this is not the quality from the albums."
3,"Re ""Pleasant Valley Sunday""","I suppose this compilation omits the album version of ""Pleasant Valley"" and includes the hideously off-key single version. Rhino also did us the service of yanking the album version from their reissue of the ""original"" ""Capricorn Pisces"" album, substituting said atrocious single version. Thank you ever so much, Rhino.Does anyone know where one can find the album version of ""Pleasant Valley Sunday"" on CD?"
4,Memories of guilty pleasures,"When I was in my teens it would have been a death wish in most conversations to admit I liked the Monkeys. Thankfully those days are long gone and now I can speak freely about things I really did enjoy. I was my younger sisters who ""bought"" the Monkey's albums and I would spirit them off to my room to play them and sing along. This collection offers the big chart records and lesser titles like Look Out, Here Comes Tomorrow that reached a pinnacle of what made for good Pop music. It also demonstrates that by luck of the draw, the network put together four talented musicians who could change speeds and style and write their own stuff. Perhaps this isn't The Beatles, The Stones, The Eagles, etc, but thanks to top notch production values and studio work it is some of the best of popular music during the mid to late 60s. And it also features the studio style of recording without multiple effects and overdubs that slowly robbed the character of music in later years. Enjoy!"
4,best of the monkeys,if you liked the old TV show the Monkees then you will like this cd there are only a few songs on the lp records that are not on this cd.I totaly recommend buying.
4,Great pop tunes that stand the test of time,"The Monkees recorded some really decent pop music, and there isn't much in the way of a klunker in this bunch. Having a bunch of great song writers of the day feeding them material helped, but they eventually ended up recording their own material, too. Listening to these tracks brings back some memories of watching their show as a kid, but the songs hold up all these years later - at least for me. Ironically, one of my least favorite songs is their Theme... but oh well, go ""Listen to the Band"" and enjoy this release!"
3,Tinny sounding,"Love the songs, of course, but the quality was very disappointing. Sounds very very tinny - glad I got it on sale - don't waste your money otherwise."
5,Excellent one-stop Monkees collection,"Sure there are way too many Monkees' anthologies out there, but this one is now the best single-CD one available : 25 tracks including many fave LP tracks, excellent remastered sound, and, for whatever reason, a five-track ""karaoke"" bonus CD. If you're one of the 6 or 7 people who doesn't yet own a Monkees CD, this is a great package. If you're a collector, you might want to pass, but it sure is hard to resist."
3,some Catchy Songs,"I dig some of the Monkeys Songs&this is a Cool Set of there's to get.""I'm a Believer"" among a few songs here are alright.I had a Friend who turned me on to some of there stuff&it's alright still with me."
3,Could do without,I thought I needed this...I listened to it...decided that I was wrong. Not as I remembered.
1,Terrible!,"First of all why were ""Pleasant Valley Sunday,"" ""Daydream Believer"" and ""Words"" excluded from this album? They were very popular and were well done and I am disappointed they are not included. Secondly, why was Peter Tork allowed to sing when his obnoxious song ""Auntie Grizelda"" was added and he sounds like he is struggling with the notes? He never had a voice. Mike Nesmith's ""You Just May Be The One"" is too country & western and is so out of place with this mix. Lastly, why did they rock up ""I Wanna Be Free"" when it was originally an slow acoustic version sung so sweetly by Davy Jones? Whoever made the song selections and did the engineering needs to attend a Rock 101 class. I will have to go to the library to borrow the Monkees Greatest Hits to fill in the missing songs and for sure I will be making a few deletions to my playlist."
2,No Thanks,"When I saw this album available as a $5 download, I thought it might be nice to add to my collection. The selection included all their biggest hits and I enjoyed the show when it was on. After listening to the samples, however, I have to pass. The songs sounded much better in memory. Listening to the samples here.the music seems weak, the quality of the recording poor. I can't imagine why I remember enjoying these songs because most of them sound horrible now. With a ~10,000 song collection, I can't imagine this album getting any play time at all. Maybe it was just the quality of this recording but even 2 stars is kind."
1,This simply can't be...,"Saying ""Best of the Monkees"" is like saying ""military intelligence"" or ""political honesty"". It simply makes no sense and has no meaning.The Monkees were not musicians (other people played for them in the studio, including Rod Prince of Bubble Puppy, etc.). The band was a fake, one of the first bands that was put together to cash in on the popular culture of the then present moment. If you ever see a video or their live performances or had to sit through the same you will know how true this is. Why do you think none of them has a sustainable solo career either before or after the Monkees?Buy this or any Monkees album at your own risk."
5,5 Stars...,"These tracks are remastered to optimum soynd quality! Essential to any Monkees fan. This mix also comes with rare B-sides, not included on their regular LP's."
4,GOOD PRODUCT BUT EXPENSIVE,"Product is excellent but seems to be expensive compared to others on the market. I used it for planting annuals, perennials, and shrubs."
3,Worth it for The Initiation,"This is worth buying for the 1984 slasher film, The Initiation, forget the other movie.The Initiation features a few good scares and is well worth a look, it's not fantastic horror though."
3,silly movie,"Not bad movies, the Initiation was the better of the two. The second one was really low budget, not much of a story plot"
2,If you buy this.. know what your getting.,"Two cheesy ultra low-budget B-movies. Hey, there isn't anything wrong with low-budget movies. It's just that neither of these choices are anything to recommend. The reason is simple, some may not even watch the films all the way through the first time. Most others will never desire to see the two films a second time for sure. So why buy a DVD that you'll never watch again? This review was written for those that haven't made a purchase of this double feature. In hopes that dollars are saved. However, if your like me you've already bought it. I happens to the best of us."
2,THE HUMILIATION!,"And yet another by the numbers slasher with moresorority girls stalked by yet another CRAZED mysterymurderer(like..do we even care anymore who it is?)Thebest thing this one has going is the killings are in a malland not the flippen woods...Still the acting,plottingand direction are pretty standard. Better than The PreyMUTILATOR and HUMONGOUS but than GLITTER 2:I'M BRIGHTis also!"
4,2 good movies on 1 disk,These are pretty good slasher flics. Montaintop Motel Massacre is about an escaped mental patient who goes on a murderous rampage in a secluded hotel in the mountaintops. She hides beneath the floors and hacks people up with a hand sythe. Pretty good. Initiation is a classic film about 2 identical ladies. One's good and one's evil. The evil one wants to go back to the good one's family and take her place. You get the picture.
2,Not one of the best!,"This is a 1980's teen-slasher flick that is pretty ordinary and bland. A college girl who is plagued by a repressed nightmare from when she was young is pledging to a sorority. She meets a doctoral candidate for psychology who is attempting to help her with her nightmare. It turns out her parents are complicit in repressing the nightmare and meanwhile a slasher is going around the town and the college campus slaughtering people.An interesting premise is helped by the fact that the film will hold your attention but in the end if you want a good slasher, there are many better ones."
3,Fairly Good B movie!,This is quite a good movie. It could be better but for the time it was quite good. Watch out for some appearances of now famous people like Deborah Morehart now Hunter Tylo on the Bold and the Beautiful. She looked stunning even then!
2,Initiation,1980's teen-slasher flick that is pretty ordinary fare.The only novelty values in this film are a young pre-fame Daphne Zuniga (Melrose Place) and a young pre-fame Hunter Tylo (The Bold and the Beautiful).While the film is probabaly a forgotten past on the ladder up for both ladies it is Hunter Tylo who now campaigns for christian values who desperately tries to forget the film more.Hunter has the all-important vital role of - The pretty girl who takes off all her clothes in front of the cameraman takes a shower in front of him and then gets out and dries herself in front of him just in case the eager teen male moviegoer missed her completely nude body the first times around - .Oh the joy of hollywood!!
2,cheesey,"I got this because I'm a big fan of Hunter Tylo and Daphne Zuniga. Hunter Tylo looks completely different (did she have surgery?) so it's fun and camp to see her here. If you like B grade stuff, this is for you!"
2,Disappointing Flick Overall,The Initiation is very slow and dreadful movie. The first 40 minutes are wasted with flashbacks and talking but the end in the shopping mall is decently done. The ending plot twist was a nice surpise but other than that this movie is strictly rental material.
2,The Initiation? Watching this could be considered hazing!,"So the name Daphne Zuniga caught my eye while scrolling through the horror section and I thought. Damn, I love Spaceballs! So I gave this one a shot and somehow made it all the way to the end despite my wife's pleading. An unmistakenly 80's horror as you will laugh FAR more than jump!So the plot is, a college girl is having re-occurring nightmares about her childhood and then people start dying. Along the way we are introduced to her sorority sisters, parents and her 'dreamy' psychology professor. Ha, ya see what I did there! That pretty much sums it up. Oh yeah, it takes place in a mall or something.So here's what you can expect, bad FX, bad writing, bad (but hysterical) acting..... Catching on here? So if you feel the need for a horror movie, rent something else. Looking for a comedy, this could fit the bill."
4,A Bargain,"The Initiation is one of the top ten 80s slasher movies. It stars Daphne Zuniga of Spaceballs fame. Good T&A plus gore, it satisfies the slasher flick formula. Mountaintop Motel Massacre is certainly watchable. Overall it is a pretty good deal to get both for the price of one."
5,Worth it for Rockin the Rockies alone,"Somehow Rockies was off my radar all these years but it's the closest thing to a feature film actually starring Moe, Larry & Curly that there ever was.The Shemp shorts made me much more of a Shemp fan than I was. And since I never bought the Shemp Stooges volumes, for the price of the set I completed my collection and got a backup set of Curly shorts basically for free."
1,Rip Off,What a rip off by Sony. Make us buy all the volumes then sell a box set. Typical corporate rip off. The rest of you can keep supporting these crooks but i'm done.
5,Outstanding!,"The video and audio quality are excellent, any episode you would want is here, and the packaging & pictures are very well-done. All discs and episodes are in chronological order with great liner notes. You can't go wrong with this collection - it was made with Stooges fans in mind."
5,Great collection at a great price.,"The entire 3 stooges collection in a single box was fantastic as I was VCRing them off TV anyway. I didn't realize how many shows they had and the time that was taking. The only issue is the sheer volume of stuff they did and how, after only a few hours (OK, maybe more than a few), I had my ""fix"" of stooges stuff and they don't get watched that much any more. At least my grandson now does the ""Curly shuffle"" from the boxing ring and does the ""a-woo-woo-woo-woo"" that Curly did. That alone is worth the little I spent on this!"
5,This Collection have a audio Spanish??,"I need to buy this collection to my wife but i need it's have a audio spanish because she dont speak english i need a collection with total audio spanish please tell if that it's collection to buy, thanks..."
4,What about the extra discs?,"On June 5, SONY will be releasing ""The Three Stooges: The Ultimate Collection"" on DVD. This will include everything that has already been released on DVD PLUS the long awaited features ""Rockin' in the Rockies"" and ""Have Rocket, Will Travel"" and numerous shorts from future stooge solo careers: 14 with Shemp Howard, 10 with Joe Besser and 4 with Joe de Rita. So far this disc is not slated for release on its own. The question is WHY? Why must I repurchase the entire collection just to get this disc or discs? This is extremely unfair and it makes all Stooges fans extremely angry. This is wrong. I very much want to complete my collection.One reviewer states that the 3 discs will be released separately. If this is true, any idea when this will be?The one problem I had with the various individual volumes concerns the 2 shorts in 3D. The glasses included makes it difficult to watch because the images are not lined up. I wonder if the Ultimate Collection corrected this shortfall."
5,Ultimate Stooges,"What a great item at an incredibly low price. Watch solo shorts, they are all funny. This is for all the Stooges fans out there a must buy."
4,The Three Stooges: The Ultimate Collection,The Three Stooges: The Ultimate CollectionMuchas gracias por sus comentarios. Les agradecería también que expresen algún al respecto del error de la página del producto sobre los subtítulos.
2,Problem,"The detail of the product, says that it brings subtitles in Spanish, when in reality, 8 190 short films DVD packs do not come with subtitles in any language, as long as the DVD extras, only comes with subtitles in English.You publish this product with Spanish subtitles and this is not real.I have purchased several products from Amazon and I never had problems with none. This is the first time that I am disappointed by the purchase, since it is not what I expected.There is the possibility that can fix this error?I would appreciate a prompt response to leogreco1969@yahoo.com.ar.Thanks a lot"
3,Great but....,"This is great that all 190 shorts are all together in one package. and especially to have the movie ""Have Rocket Will Travel"" included in this. But for the price they offer, it would be better if they included ALL of the three stooges movies included to hard to find movies like ""Soup to Nuts"" & ""Snow White & The Three Stooges."" But that's just a personal opinion."
3,Giving it 2 extra stars.,"I called Sony, they confirmed that the 3 bonus discs will NOT be sold separately. Although, I do see that some outside sellers have the bonus set for around $45 on here.Being a life-long fan of The Six Stooges, I had to have the bonus features. I ended up selling my 8 individual sets and making enough off of them to pick up this set...I'm glad I did. I'm still angry that Sony has screwed us over with these bonus discs, I'm hoping they will eventually do the right thing and release them.If you're a casual fan, the bonus discs might not be a big deal. I consider myself a rabid fan...from Healy to De Rita, I want to see it all...especially the Shemp Howard solo shorts!It's a great set if you haven't picked up the others...if you have, you might want to do what I did, or give your individual sets to a friend who might be in need of a good laugh."
3,WTF...Another Mystery...FRAK :(,"Doesn't the bonus features package include three disks ???I will order the bonus features package as soon as Amazon allows customers the ability to pre-order it (hopefully sooner than later). I will not order the repackaged shorts volumes (as I bought them when originally released). This will always hold true in my buying habbits SONY, I do not double dip on my home entertainment, but I will buy new material as it is released onto standard DVD.I look forward to ""NEW"" (not old) stuff in the future...NUK...NUK...NUK :)Have fun !!!"
1,Thanks for thanks!,"Thanks to Sony for the giant kick in the rear! After buying all the volumes, they're now re-releasing them in their original packages along with a bonus set of DVD's. What a rip-off for the fans that already bought all the volumes and just want the bonus discs. Hopefully they'll listen to their fans and release the bonus set seperately. Also, the shorts that were released in the original volumes that were presented in the ""widescreen"" format weren't actually filmed that way. Columbia, or Sony, simply cropped the tops and bottoms of the later shorts to have them appear to have been filmed in widescreen. Why was this done? The only thing I can think is that they released these shorts to theaters that were showing full length features that were in the widescreen format, which was new to that era. If these shorts would be released in their original full screen format and remastered, I'd gladly buy them again. Not holding my breath, though!"
3,non-lasting product,"it worked well in the beginning, but now the rubber which holds the plastic bars snapped or broke. so i'm back to old ways - hand squeezer :("
1,Total waste of money!,This product is two pieces of plastic held together by a weak rubber band. It is not effective in squeezing a tube of toothpaste.
1,Not worth it,I was disappointed int his product. The quality ws good enough; but it does not work well for squeezing the tube. I do not recommend this product.
4,Great product,This simple product is great and everyone I give one too loves it and wants more for their kids. Great stocking stuffer. Little fixes like this really help to not be wasteful and save a bit of time every day.
4,Made for larger tubes.,"Good item but you need to know that it is not really made for smaller tubes. For things like regular-size toothpaste it is fine but not good for smaller tubes like ointments, creams, etc."
2,"Okay, but","just old stories in a new wrapper. Invites comparison to Mario Puzo: Breslin's is an Irish take on the human condition-- sarcasm like Puck, ""what fools these mortals be;"" Puzo does grand opera--Italian melodrama of the human condition, waste and loss. Both are narrative, but Puzo's characters are rounder; neither is dramatic.Breslin is fun when he writes about those who connive against interest. But characters here are thin; interactions between lovers are haptic--flat AND thin, like cartoons. His gift is tapping memory for an image, a smell, a habit; and making just-in-time connections--gangster trading cards undoing the mob. But zip in his prose has gone missing. Maybe New York has changed for him, too, and his point, that the world of the mob was its own undoing, applies to him. The Gotham he loved is gone, and he mourns like Damon Runyon."
2,A DISSAPOINTMENT,"I am not a fan of the Political Breslin but I admire and like the literary Breslin. He is a good story teller. However, this book is not up to his standards. I know there are kernals of information, truth behind the fiction that I would not have known. I just expected Breslin to put these truths in a more consistent storyline. I think he could have written a better book."
4,"Funny, but hard to follow at times.","If your a fan of mob stuff, this book will entertain you. It's obviously about Vinny the Chin, you realize that right away (if you've done your mob homework). Jimmy Breslin has a strange style of writing that can be hard to follow at times. Your not sure what tense you are in at times, present or past, he jumps around, and it gets a little annoying. Well, he was a columinst anyway. This is my first Breslin read. I hear the Gang That Couldnt Shoot Straight is much better. This book pokes fun at the stupidity and contradictions that is a mobsters life. But it entertains! Very street. Sometimes a description of an inflection in a characters tone might have helped, i had to go over some passages more than once. But all in all, this is a humorous look at a sad world. Enjoy!"
2,"Nice try, but no cigar.","Night after night, I just couldn't put the book down. That's because I kept hoping to come across the laughs promised by the blurbs on the book's jacket. I never found any; maybe you just had to be there. Nevertheless, I can't insult the author by giving the book just one star, because writing is hard work. So, two stars it is."
2,Huge Disappointment,"I grew up within 25 miles on New York City in the 60s and 70s when Breslin was king. The Daily News and the New York Post were staples in our home; my blue collar father brought them home religiously daily. Reading about the Mafia was almost a hobby for me, real life soap opera; Breslin was always there, commenting, following, allowing me into their world through tabloid print. In this book, it seems like Breslin struggles in creating historic fiction. His story telling is uneven and sporadic, akin to sitting around with a reminiscing Grandpa, waiting impatiently through the slow and disjointed anecdotes, wondering if the chuckle was worth the wait. The characters, hyperboles providing targets of convenience for uprorious laughter, are underutilized as Breslin scores low, many circles away from the bull's eye.Big dissappointment. You can never go home again."
1,NEVER BUY THIS,"This has very bad side effects. This is not like the one ""Yohimbe Bark"" Swanson used to sell before. I couldn't sleep because of this for more than two day just for a tablet."
3,Maybe 500 mg is too high?,"I ordered Maca, Red Ginseng and Yohimbe like I did the last time but this time I had to order them separately, no three-pack deal. One weekend I took all three just to see what would happen. Well, not good news. I was wired. Then, I took one pill a day at a time to figure out which one had the side effects and it's this one. I took one of these by itself and my blood pressure shot up, I felt anxious and a little overheated. It does work below the waist(!) but, I won't take another full capsule again. Similar effects as Viagra to me."
5,my kids love them,"i bought this 2 years ago,the stickers are colorful and cute. we have used them for everything. my girls have a reading worm hanging on their bedroom wall. they put a sticker for ever book they read. it has encouraged them to read more and make their worm longer. we have just peeled our 2008 worm off and started a new 2009 one, i have 2 pages left in the old sticker book so i'm ordering another one now."
4,Prompt Delivery,I ordered this necktie just days before our wedding and they came in promptly and I was happy with the color and it coordinated well with the rest of our wedding colors. Appreciate the prompt delivery.
2,Wanted to give 2.5 starts,"I bought this book because it seemed like it would be a good resource to learn how to teach basic tumbling to my athletes and clients (I am a strength coach and own a gym). The book does not do a great job explaining these movements to the lay person.For the price, I am very underwhelmed. The illustrations are very poor. Just stick figures doing rough approximations of the movements. The tips and instructions are not very clear, and it seems you need a background in tumbling to fully understand it.To be fair, I haven't thoroughly read it. When I do, and if my first impression is wrong I will update this. But as it stands, do not buy this book if you want a resource to teach beginners how to tumble if you do not have a tumbling background."
4,I'm a big fan of Mary-Kate and Ashley!!!,This cassette is neat. It has lot's of great songs. I'm an Olsen Twin fan and I'm 15. It's a bummer that this cassette isn't available in New Zealand. I had to order it from America. It's definitely worth it though!
4,Best C.D They Made,"The twins have NEVER made a c.d. better! the songs are so fun to sing along with & its really a good c.d. to lisen over & over with. Its a shame, I didnt find it at ANY store in my area intill I ordered it!Thank you Mary-Kate & Ashley for all your talents & brightning my day!"
3,"Good, but coulda been better","I bought this CD because of the song ""Take Me"", which is probably the best song on the album. I think Lari White is a great singer - and I agree that she is underrated - but this album seemed ""too much"". I can't explain this exactly, but it just seems like she's trying to please everyone by the songs she chooses for this album. ""On A Night Like This"" is good, but the lyrics are too cliche - same with ""That's What You Do"". I also didn't see the point in the duet with Toby Keith ""Only God Could Stop Me Loving You"". I agree that they try to overpower each other - no emotion in this ""love"" song! I also didn't see the purpose behind ""You Can't Go Home Again"". The best songs on this album are ""Take Me"", ""Stepping Stone"", and ""This Is Love"" - which could have been a hit if it had been released as a single. As a piece of advice, listen to Lari on the radio - don't spend money on the actual CD."
5,Smashing Good Read,"In a well-written first book, Nick Sarantakes gives us an impressive account of the years when Americans governed the island of Okinawa. If you lived or were stationed on ""the rock"" from 1945 to 1972 you will find this bringing back all sorts of memories. The argument Sarantakes makes about Okinawa being the center of a ""double containment"" aimed at protecting the U.S. and its allies from either the Communists or a resurgent and angry remilitarized Japan is thought provoking and well-supported. Sarantakes also does a good job of giving us perceptive character sketches of the major players that shaped U.S. foreign policy towards Japan during this period. My favorite was General Paul Caraway who wore his cover too tight on his head. This book would make a good Christmas gift for any Air Force or Marine Corps currently on the island."
2,Limited but useful,"Sarantakes' book is useful as a study of the politics of occupation of Okinawa among the American constituencies involved, particularly the policy debates between the State and Defense Departments. It's of less use for a sense of the ""U.S.-Japanese relations"" part of the subtitle, principally because the author has no facility with Japanese sources. It's of even less use for a sense of the Okinawan side of things for the same reason. This is a very limited and one-sided study, but if you read it with that caveat, it contains a good deal of fascinating material on policy debates among Americans."
5,Excellent Pads and easy to Install,"I bought these for my 2000 BMW 740iL and they're excellent. Not nearly as much brake dust, no squeaking and the brake jobs on these BMW's are just as easy to do as any other car. Be sure to purchase a new Sensor wire when you're replacing the pads. It only goes on the drivers side and clips onto the pad. They're usually around $12 at any BMW online parts store. Get it before installing the brakes to save you the time of doing it later. Without it, your brake light will stay on."
5,Outstanding,"I saw this movie on TV and decided to send for it.. I am very pleased with the quality, story line and theme of movie. I will send for more movies through Amazon."
5,Very good video.,The Christmas Choir. Have watched it on TV several times and plan to watch it every year. Good Christmas viewing.
2,Bad acting,"I watched the entire movie although I almost stopped several times. It could've been great with better acting, but the main star didn't seem to be into it very much."
3,Good Movie Night,I thought Ive done a review on this movie.It was a good movie I gave it to my best friend for Christmas.This movie really makes you stop and think about your life and many blessings God gives you so you need to try and do the same to help those in need.
3,Good Christmas movie.,"A good story to remind us what we could do if we just opened our eyes and heart. A real lesson/reminder movie that leaves you warm inside. I've added this one (The Christmas Choir) to my Christmas librarie of movies. It reminds me to look beyond the husle, hastle, and push of life to see what it truely important."
5,Christmas Choir,"Arrived on time in perfect condition. This movie touched me deeply, and I was so happy to be able to get it for my Christmas Collection. Excellent movie, must see."
1,Pathetic,"The worst pile of contrived drivel I've ever read. The stories have little, if anything to do with the Knights Templar. Most take place in the present, or in ""alternate realities."" Kurtz even has the audacity to plug another of her books WITHIN the pages of this one. Third- and fourth-rate stories by authors out for a quick buck.If you still want to read it, you can have mine. Please don't waste money on it. Wish I could give it zero stars."
4,A good read,"The stories in this collection captured the feel of the Templars. If you're looking for a serious, scholarly work about the Order's history, don't bother. On the other hand, if you love tales of Chivalry built upon a foundation of Templar myth, this is an excellent collection."
3,Moderately Entertaining Speculation,"This book is ""entertaining"" in that it provides ""real facts"" liberally laced with a decent amount of plausible ""speculation."" Unfortunately, the quality of the stories is uneven. Some stories are well-conceived and well-written but others are not. The book was worth the purchase price to me solely because it includes a Time Patrol story by Poul Anderson which I never knew existed. If you are an avid Time Patrol fan, you probably want to add this book to your collection."
4,An entertaining flight of fancy.,"Not a bad collection of fiction, with a decent bit of historic overview by Kurtz. While not a serious piece of historical fiction, it is an entertaining escape for those with Templar interests."
1,Don't Waste the Money,"I used to look forward to Coulter's works, but the last few have been a huge disappointment. I swear this is the last one of hers I will buy. Stupid characters, inane dialogue, boring plot and ridiculously overdone sex scenes. Enough said."
2,Not very captivating,"I have enjoyed this author for years, but this just didn't seem to flow. I was excited to see an actual new book on the shelf and not just another book in ""new clothes"" as she likes to put it."
5,In My Opinion,"I look forward to books by Catherine, Her herones do not ""wimp"" out after having sex. Which I find in alot of other writers books. When a strong female heroine has sex they seem to be weak and get a case of the ""stupids"". The characters in The Courtship are refreshing. I enjoyed re-visiting some of the characters from previous books. I enjoy reading Catherine Coulter and look forward to her books. When I read a book and can't put it down like Catherine Coulter's books it is because she draws me in as if I were there. I don't disect what an author writes. But if an Author can draw you in and you are totally invovled in the story and characters then to me the book is a KEEPER. And yes I have ALL she has written and re-read them."
1,An embarrassment to print,"I understand that historical accuracy in a romance novel may seem like an oxymoron, but could we please try for a little. I used to read Ms. Coulter's books with fascination until I went to college. Now I know better (and more). Her characters are trite and the rough sex is more disturbing than titillating. Also, her grasp of the English language is weak--a picture is ""hung"" and a man is ""hanged."" Helen Mayberry had enormous potential as a character that she ceased to realize by the middle of the book. The suspenseful treasure hunt degenerated into nonsense by the end and was randomly complicated by the introduction of the former husband. Why must every woman in her novels receive a beating? I highly recommend spending money on worthier authors, such as Lisa Kleypas, Maggie Osborne, and Pamela Morsi."
1,"Ms. Coulter, Don't do us any favors...","Ms. Coulter has been writing contemporary novels lately, and this seems to be the author's attempt to pacify her historical romance fans. By drawing out a minimal plot and resurrecting old characters to provide secondary action (and not adding anything new to them), she's technically given us what we've been asking for, but it is nowhere near the caliber of previous efforts (ALL of which I have read). Please, Ms. Coulter, don't do us any favors. We can wait a little longer for the real thing. And, readers, if this was your first Coulter novel, don't judge this author by this book. Pick ANY other one and be delighted!"
3,Not up to her usual standards,"I found the storyline to be incompletely developed and weak. The characters were predictable and the frequent mentions of ""discipline"" were tiring and then revolting."
2,Not Her Best Work,"This was an enjoyable read, but only average in terms of Catherine Coulter's total output. The discipline was an interesting twist, but still didn't exactly rivet me to my chair. The story does add more detail about the Sherbrookes (the Bride trilogy), and caught up a few other characters from earlier books, and these were what kept my interest. One very good thing was that she has stopped using ""thus"" so frequently in the characters' conversations, which was very annoying in her previous Regency books. I recommend it as a light read. Keeper? Probably not."
2,This book needs to be whipped into shape,I agree with the first reviewer. All of the discipline talk did not give me a thrill. It was strange to have characters standing around at balls having open group discussions on male/female sexual domination techniques. The subject matter did not take the place of solid characterization and plot.
2,A disappointing effort!,"I'd rather these mega-star authors write few quality books rather than a hastily put together book. The characters had no depth, and I only finished it to see what exactly would happen. The entire novel dragged, and was not at all like Coulter's other efforts. I'd get this one from the library if you have to read all her efforts."
1,Terrible !,"The plot was interesting, but the characters were silly and the dialog was ridiculous. In a word: TerribleP.S. all that prattle about discipline, champagne, and Teeny Flock... give me a break!"
1,BoOOoOoOoOooring!!,"I am a fan of Catherine Coulter and I LOVED all the Bride series books, and Mad Jack. I was excited to see that there was another book with tie ins to the other books. Where I really liked the characters in the Brides books, Spencer and Helen were VERY underdeveloped. There was all this sex and weird discipline, and the plot itself was weak. The villians seemed to be just thrown in as after thoughts. The supporting characters barely supported and the main characters were, well, boring. I usually read Ms. Coulters books in a matter of a day or two. It took me well over a week to get through this one. I kept thinking maybe this will get better.. it has to get better... but it never did. I forced myself to finish it. It is definitely NOT a keeper!"
2,Had promise but was Disappointing,"I was looking forward to this book. It had a lot of potential. The beginning scene was very exciting and then......Well, somethings are just too good to be true. I have always been a great Coulter fan (I think I own every book), but I will think twice before I purchase her next book."
1,"Catherine, What happen!","What a terrible and boring book. I can't believe Catherine Coulter wrote this. She must have been in a big hurry to meet a deadline. We got a book here were every character is eccentric. We have pages wasted on characters that go nowhere, their story line is just dropped.We have character such Douglas and Alex Sherbrooke returning and acting odder then ever. And of course Catherine's back on the magical treasure hunt. I already knew how the story was going to end. All her books are running the same story, different treasure. I don't know what happen, but I use to love discovering a new Catherine Coulter book and spending all my free time devouring it. I won't be in a hurry next time to waste my time or money. I was very disappointed. If you want to read a good book, Look elsewhere."
1,Ms. Coulter's Publisher Deserves Discipline For This,"This book is just terrible. It has inspired me to take up romance novel writing because I know that any attempt I would make would be better than this. Speaking of romance, Ms. Coulter, where was the romance in this novel? There was a lot of f-ing but I missed the part where Spenser and Helen fall in love. The discipline sub-plot was just absurd. I want my money back."
2,I must be missing something.,"This is the first Coulter book I have read, and I was surprised at how disappointed I was. I found the characters thinly drawn and the dialogue so artificial that at times I felt as though I were watching auditions for a high school play. The period characters' fascination with erotic discipline was contrived to the point of a farce, but it did make for some giggles. In fact, at times I thought the author might be doing just that - teasing us with an absurd comedy. I've heard that Ms. Coulter's other books are excellent, and the story line did capture my imagination (even though the characters got in the way at times!), so I will give her another try in the future. However, this one will go into my give-away bag."
5,Totally Delightful!,"This book was different than most of this period, and a complete blast! I loved it, from the overheard and deliciously sinful conversation that started it out, to the very end. It was a hilarious romp with two extraordinary characters that kept me giggling throughout. And bringing the Sherbrookes into the mix was wonderful, not only into the mystery, but into the 'discipline' as well made the story that much funnier! A MUST for all Catherine Coulter fans!"
1,Not up to Coulter standards!,"For a long-standing Coulter fan, I found this to be a disappointment. The plot dragged, and the characters were too much like previous heros and heroines from her other books. The Sherbrookes did not keep in character, and there was too much discussion about ""discipline"" without the reader finding out what was actually meant. I felt Ms. Coulter was bored with the manuscript and the period. She has certainly shown her amazing talents in her latest contemporary novels, but those abilities are not showcased in this work."
2,What a disappointment!,"Catherine Coulter's books have been on the decline for the past few years. They used to be wonderful, witty, and fun. Now, the story lines are slow and silly, the sex scenes uninspired (does everyone single one of her male characters have the same ""problem""?) and the conversations strange (odd half thoughts inserted in a lame attempt at humor end up just being confusing). I had hopes that this book would be a return to her earlier style and for the first 3 pages, it was. It quickly went downhill, however. I couldn't even finish it. Please get a new editor, Miss Coulter, your's isn't doing her job!"
1,boring even with all the sex...,"Wow - what inane characters! With Helen, or Helen of Troy, teasing the womanizing Lord Beechman early on, one understands that the author has designated Helen as the supposedly ""spunky"" gal who can handle a man early on. I had no real issue with the sex scenes. I like sex. But she went over the top re. the domination bit. It got really boring. Also, what the heck happened to Alexnadra and Douglas - are they middle aged already? Also, Lord Beechman was a bit of a bore being so fascinated with such a tease as Helen. Got old...."
3,Could be better,I have read all of Ms Coulter's books generally I love the characters and the story. This just missed the boat somehow. At times the dynamic between our characters seems to be going strong and then suddenly falls flat. If you are a fan you would probably be able to enjoy it for the most part. But if this is your first one of her books or you are not a big fan you should probably skip this one.
2,Disappointed!,"I have read every book by Coulter. I thought they couldn't get any worse than Mad Jack, but I was wrong. I have been trying to read this book for 2 weeks, and I finally made it to page 73 before I gave up. It rambles on and on with no sense of purpose. I definitely will read reviews before I buy another Coulter book. I was very disappointed with this one."
1,Disappointing!,"Having read all of the previous efforts, I found the plot weak, the characters uninteresting, and the effort not worth the price.The story line was boring, this book is a renter, not a keeper."
2,Porn movie?,"Reading this book is like watching a porn movie: all sex and no plotline.Another thing I found unbelievable is that Helen took back her maiden name and became a ""Miss"" again. From what I know of the period, women loved to be a widow because that status granted them more freedom. Coulter could not come up with a good explanation why Helen would take back her maiden name after her first husband died."
1,Disappointing is the only word that fits,"I've read and liked Catherine Coulter's novels in the past, so when I saw this at the library, I picked it up eagerly. Wow, was I disappointed! The sex was ridiculous to the point of annoying, and the whole attitude of the characters was very...""modern."" I don't think this should be categorized as an historical novel, and certainly not as a romance. The only reason I finished the book was the lamp plotline, and that was also a letdown. The dialogue seemed unlikely, the narrative careless. While I don't expect or even want romances to always be realistic, this was just not enjoyable me as a regency lover and a writer."
3,it could have been a great book,"on a good note, this book brings a wealth of information about business cycles--historic-, economic-, academic-, and even trader-perspectives.however, the information does not stand together--ideas jump all over the place, not connected nor well developed. careless editing--some numbers are wrong. all these make the reader long for a more careful approach.all in all, this could be a spring-board to other titles/authors. at about half the price it could be a different story."
3,DOA,"This item was purchased from amazon and was DOA. Amazon shipped a replacement via next day air (in reality it didn't arrive for three days as the day following my call was a holiday) and the replacement works fine. Even though this item is designed for musical equipment, I use it as a computer workstation surge protector and I like the metal housing and sturdy appearance."
5,Powerful,It works like it should. It is a great balance between a raw outlet and a universal power supply. Heavy duty too
5,Just What I Needed,"This power strip is exactly what I need on my gigs. 6 outlets, heavy duty with a 15 ft. cord attached. Now I have the powerstrip that I need & no longer need to carry the (bright orange) 80 ft. extension cord that I use in my yard in the trunk (just in case it's needed). I read some reviews where people claimed this strip improved the sound of their pa system. I cant say I noticed any difference in my sound (only used it once so far), but it fits the bill for me. I would recommend this."
5,Great product!,"This power strip has a great cord length, and is solid strong construction. This is definitely a buy if you need a cord that can go from a wall to a desk with no problem."
5,Great power strip for a great price.,Furman always makes good stuff. I have several of their rack mount units and they have yet to fail me. I liked it so much I bought 3 more. Highly recommended.
3,"Heavy, not ready for duty","This is not a power conditioner. Furthermore, the plugs are quite close together and all face the same way, so it can be difficult to use all six plugs on this power strip. It seems to be solid, because it is metal, but otherwise, it doesn't seem much better than an ordinary power strip."
4,tough and uniform,"I picked these up this summer at GC and I am glad I did. I also use the rack mounted version and along with making it possible to organize plugs, cables and power distribution they add a neat/organized look to my setup."
5,Works and looks good,"A steel power strip with a 15' cord makes for a nice built-in power connector for a mobile media cabinet. Everything in the cabinet gets plugged into this. A nice black color helps hide everything. I'm not sure about the power conditioning. Without some proper equipment, how would you test that?"
5,Very sturdy!,Bought those to provide outlets for laptop computers for our undergraduate students.Who work in a room with lots of tables but few outlets.Heavy use.Holding up very well :-)
5,Built like a brick you-know-what house.,What do you expect from Furman besides rock solid reliability when it comes to your power? This is an essential part of my gig bag now. The cable is very generous and can always get power to my rig from anywhere in the clubs that I play. Even if they only have one outlet on stage and the guitar player needs it for all his pedals. I haven't had a chance to test how it handles power problems but so far I haven't had any issues to speak of.It is SOLID. Well worth the money. This is a no brainer. Every gigging musician should have one in their kit.
5,Swift postage!,"I ordered this book because it was 75% cheaper than in the bookstores in Norway. I received it before it was supposed to arrive, and it was in perfect condition. I've got nothing to complain about! All good!"
1,Global Garbage,"This collection of articles is a poorly edited collection of lesser known writings by academic authors, most of which border on incoherence. The articles contained in this edition reveal that the authors and their editors are sorely out of touch with the dynamics of the pop music industry in their naive view of global trends and styles. The articles are largely unremarkable, labourious to slog through, and filled with useless jargon that renders it neither suitable for academic nor lay readers. Save your money, as this volume is not worth the exhorbitant purchase price. I hate to offer even one star's endorsement of this sad excuse for a book."
3,Bobh,An interesting book. It certainly was different from any I had read before. I would read another of his just to see how another would compare.
3,A Mixed blessing,"I can't say all of this for Hellraiser fans who might disown this movie due to the storyline and the appearence of Pinhead. However i was disappointed but i did enjoy the movie, after all the acting, the script, and some of the fx were good. It involves a corrupt cop (Craig Sheffer) who realizes after he solved the Lamont Confriguation (The Puzzle Box)he meets tragic deaths and he dosen't understand why. It turns out that he was in helland he didn't know it until he faced his own demons and his judge Pinhead (Doug Bradely) who well damn his soul forever. The storyline was interesting in a unique way because it had some suspense in it. Now what I didn't like about Hellraiser: Inferno is that Pinhead was in it about 2-3minutes and that was it. The DVD features a interesting interview with Doug Bradley (Pinhead) which is about 5 mins or so and Secrets of Hellraiser revealed. Over all a good movie but should have been better."
1,Not a Good Choice!,I have seen all the other Hellraiser movies and I liked them all. The first two were the best and the other two were pretty good. However this movie is very bad! It is not a Hellraiser movie at all. You only see Pinhead for about 2 min in the whole movie and the movie doesnt even make sense... Total waist of time and money...
4,A new start in the Hellraiser series,"Hellraiser Inferno starts with a detective who is being haunted by a serial killer called the Enginer. The Enginer is setting the detective up. We see the puzzle box earlier in the film, and there are a few clues the detective finds out while trying to prove his innocense.This movie shows the Cynobites a little less than the 1st Hellraiser. Pinhead is only on there a few seconds himself, so this mainly focuses on the detective and his life. I still like the new focus of the main character finding out why his reality is coming apart slowly, then Pinhead just showing up killing so often; like parts 3-5."
3,"Different from the last few sequels, but still good","Direct-to-video offshoot of the series is different than the other sequels. It's done in a Jacob's Ladder/Angel Heart vein and now has Pinhead back as more of a referee rather than the main character. The story surrounds a corrupt cop who stumbles onto the puzzle box, opens it, and then goes through his own personal hell with Pinhead popping up every once in a while to confuse and scare him more. It's actually very engrossing. Fans may be disappointed with the lack of Pinhead onscreen, but anyone who's been to film school knows that sometimes ""less is more."" Inferno was a treat."
1,WAIT,"I have heard two different reviews, one: pinhead wasn't in it, therefore it......... two: this is a great ""film"" that ""makes you think"". HA! i laugh at both. this movie ...... but not because of the absence of pinhead. ..............., and for those of you that think its a great throwback to the book, its not. This is the worst representation of the book i've ever seen. Also, I have seen a lot of horror movies and this one was cheap, predictable and DEPRESSING. At least .................... wasn't quite so depressing. damn. this was complete crap! CLIVE BARKER RULES!"
1,Horrible,"I must say that I did expect a certain kind of movie when i went to rent Hellraiser:Inferno. But wouldn't we all?? You watch Halloween to see Myers, not a buch of candy toting, bug-headed kids! I watch Friday the 13th for Jason, and Elm Street for Freddy!! Why should I expect any less for the Hellraiser series?? It's hard to get into any movie that doesn't have a plot. The effects were shoddy, the story was lame and long-paced, not even a 2 minute appearance of Pinhead himself could revive the decrepid storyline. Even though the acting was somewhat acceptable, not even the Nightbreed guy could save this movie. Please, Hollywood, give us one last Hellraiser, fill it with blood and ripping bodies, and end this series on a good note, not some made for video fiasco."
3,Better Than Bloodline .... 3 Stars.,"Bloodline [stunk]. This one will not please the diehard cenobite Hellraiser fans of the 1st three releases. More pinhead and torn flesh was needed here. However, this one has a little spin on it, weaving it into a pretty cool 'Horror/Mystery' if you will.The cocaine addicted detective in search of the engineer (Pinhead), and all his mental torment, made for a decent Hellraiser. No Jesus wept lines here, or memorable Pinhead lines like, ""We'll tear your soul apart!"", but it beat Bloodline free and clear.Don't buy or rent if you loved the flesh tearing cenobites from the first three, but check it out if you want a cool thriller twist on the Hellraiser series.3 STAR RATING FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB OF HORROR DVD'S, USA."
1,I don't understand everyone...,"I bought this hellraiser film, because of the huge 5 star ratings everyone was giving it. I will never again trust amazon ratings. This movie went no where. The first 3 movies had a good pace and plenty of things happening throughout them. Great stories and wonderfully messed up ideas.That was not to be in this film. Nothing worthwhile happened on until the last 15 minutes. I'm sorry but if I wanna waste an hour and a half for things to pick up I'll watch the Ring. This movie was incredibly dull, and at no point did I care for the characters, and I wished the whole time for that man's death.Watch Hellraiser 1, 2 ,3, 4 and 6 for good hellraiser movies. I wish I could get that time that I lost."
2,Plot's gone to HELL!,"...The effects are brilliant, I liked the occasional 'made-yer-jump' bits, but it does not feel like a 'Hellraiser' film. The direction is well done and made rather trippy and Pinhead became a background-baddie (as in the first film) but the plot loses itself in confusion. The characters are unlikable, and even Doug Bradley didn't put much effort into his much under-exposed role as Pinhead. Perhaps he's had enough, I know I have, this once brilliant saga of films has now become tiresome and empty, I think this could be the final nail in the coffin. It seemed so good, but failed to live up to my hopes. A shame.'Hellraiser': 1987-2000 (R.I.P. Pinhead)"
1,idk,"i did not like this movie because i guess im a die hard slasher fan like jason,freddy,michael myers and so on i did like the first 3 installments and and bloodline wasnt very good but i didnt hate it.I loved hellraiser 3 hell on earth because through my eyes it was a slasher flick with lots of gore which i like.But i did not like this movie because plainly didnt understand it.Maybe you did but i did not I did not get the end at all and i didnt like that pinhead was in the movie for like 2 MINUTES!!But whatever maybe you will have better luck im more of a slasher movie lover..."
1,WORST HELLRAISER YET!,"Trying to put a pop-culture spin on Hellraiser....just WASN'T Hellraiser! NYPD Blue meets Hellraiser- NOT what I had in mind! Do yerself a favor and pass on this flick! I'm glad I rented it, and didn't just buy it like I'd originally planned to. Oh, and for those who are wondering how Pinhead could return after having been killed in Hellraiser IV- Bloodline took place in the FUTURE, that's how- which made PLENTY of room for more sequels."
1,A horrible movie not even directed by the original director,"This movie is horrible, the legacy of the whole hellraiser series is left behind int his movie, everytime someone opens the box the cenobites have to be sent back to hell or else they remain on earth, this movie never shows you what happens after the box is opened, instead something stupid happens, and suddenly pinhead is just interested with one person for no reason at all, my advice, whoever directed this movie, you should stop right now..."
2,Outer Limits Maybe..,"This was totally not in the realm of the previous Hellraiser movies! What little screen time the cenobites got was devoted mostly to a pair of ""twins"" that look more like residents of Who-ville than demons. Pinhead only makes a cameo and could have been replaced with Rod Serling [and the story would make a lot more sense]. There was nothing shocking, scary or even the least bit engrossing in the whole movie. The characters talk about the ""carnage"" at murder scenes and then we see a blood-spattered body. So? We can see that on the news. That is not carnage. The entire story is better explained by the main character's drug abuse rather than the puzzle box & cenobites.This would have been an okay episode of the Outer Limits or Twilight Zone, but it is not a Hellraiser."
3,empty,"so after bloodline, i'm left wondering how they are going to resurrect pinhead this time. Like all horror franchises, at some point we must abandon previous plotlines and just pretend the other films do not exist. Hence we have inferno. I suppose this was meant to be somewhat of a new beginning or departure for the series but it does not deliver the goods. Reminds me of Coke and New Coke. We all know what happened to New Coke. The DVD format at least makes the film look nice visually. Im not saying Inferno does not have its moments. It does. Theres one scene where a character is flogged and tortured while his buddy watches from a window across the street. This is classic cenobite punishment. However, these moments cannot make up for the sense that something is missing here. The lack of cenobite mytholgy here is disheartening. This film could have been a whole lot better if it had some soul. As it is, its simply average."
1,A disgrace to Hellraiser fans!,"I'm having a hard time describing the disgust i felt when I was through with this film, not because of the usual gore, but because they totally ruined a perfect series!!! Pinhead appears but 5 minutes at the end, and then with the morals of a catholic priest!! I am lost for words to describe my disappointment..."
1,snore-raiser,"i'm not against stylish, thought-provoking, gore-implied horror movies. this however, isn't one. it's a dull rehashing of ideas that were better executed by other directors in other films.while it could've been an interesting premise, this film is just dull. you don't really care about the characters (not to mention that craig sheeffer must've pissed off the director of photography as i couldn't imagine more unflattering shots) or what is happening to them. the film's approach seems to be driven more by budget constraints vs. intent. and worse, you can figure out what's going to happen fairly early on. you just don't care.my original interst in the hellraiser series has been the psycho-sexual undertones (and overtones) in it's approach to sex, evil, hell, etc. without any involvement from clive barker, this seems to be a 2nd rate effort from 2nd rate talent.rent it if you must. don't bother buying."
2,Stupid movie,"First off, I have to give this film credit for not trying to be Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th like Hellraiser 3 and 4, its good to see the series take a new approach to the story of the box thats the gateway to hell.But, this film has every stupid cliche you can think of for a POLICE THRILLER. And that horrible actor they got for the lead part is um, horrible.I don't even recommend renting this one."
1,Not Hellraiser at all.....,"Terrible installment to the Hellraiser series. This movie not only lacked a story line that stayed together, it lacked the ""charm"" of the previous Hellraiser movies. Why was Pinhead ""counsiling"" this guy? He is to be the pain and torturer not the philisophical metaphoic therapist. I can't believe they called this a Hellraiser movie. Ignores the facts laid out in previous installments and goes off on a ridiculous tangent about nothing. Should not have been called Hellraiser, in fact should not have been made at all, it didn't even intrest me enough to be able to watch it as a movie mutually exclusive to the Hellraiser series....lousy, boring, and pathetic."
3,not much,"okay, if your a hellraiser fan prepare to be disapointed. this one is way better than that awful boring hellraiser:bloodline,it has a great story to it but not much hellraiser action. the ending is the most stupidest ending of all and the gore is pretty week and the new cenibites are bogus,the story is very good and pinhead was quite amusing but you only see him for five minutes.the conclusion is quite boring and tastless,so if your a die hard fan, don't expect much."
1,THIS MOVIE [stinks] LIKE NO OTHER HAS [stunk] BEFORE!!!,"I would like to invite the director/writer of this ""movie"" to tell us just what the [heck] they were thinking. This has no business being called a""Hellraiser""sequel. You could cut out the two minutes of Pinhead footage and no one would notice....because he doesn't even really figure into the incredibly stupid storyline!! Why would anyone sign on to direct a ""sequel,"" and then show such comtempt for the fans?? Even worse, this movie has the look of a cheap porno...no wait, most pornos have better lighting and even better storylines!!! This movie is just a big stinking pile of [stuff]!!! Ignore the other reviews, because it must be the director and his family trying to trick people into buying this really BAD, BAD movie!!!"
2,The worst of the Hellraiser movies,"This my friends is quite a let down. I'am a huge Hellraiser fan, infact I consider the Hellraiser films to be the best horror movies on the market. I even have a tattoo of pinhead on my arm!But the truth is that Inferno was a huge disappointment. It was almost as if the director had a super limited budget, and Doug Bradley only had 2 days to be on the set. You barely get to see pinhead! I don't know if anyone else noticed, but in the first Hellraiser pinhead has a cool powerful and deep voice.Over time it seems to get higher and more raspy. I personally liked his voice in the first Hellraiser a lot better than his voice now.All and all this movie is a Hellraiser movie, but it could have been much much better.Parts 1-4 are great, try those out if you haven't seen them."
5,One of the Best,My name is Cody and I just got through watching Hellraiser 5 Inferno. I think that this movie is one of the best films in the series. One and Two where the best of all time. Three was alright and the four one was like Halloween 3. Not really a point to it. In this one they confuse you so bad. I hated it until I finally realized what was going on. You just have to see it with an open mind to know what I'm talking about. Pinhead goes back to being a total mystery to the audience. When he is in though he is the old Pinhead that we have come to love. Even though the other Cenobites suck they were still good. Out of five points I give this one a five.Cody D. Seaton
1,"Ummm, Did someone say this is a Hellraiser Movie?","Okay, I've watched this movie twice now, and although I don't think it is bad....I just don't get the feel of this being a Hellraiser movie, I think the positive reviews on this movie are misleading to people who haven't seen it. I'm sorry, when the name is Hellraiser I DO expect to see Pinhead more than just a few minutes. This is NOT a hellraiser movie, nor will it ever be. They should have called it ""The Finger Killer"" with a special guest appearence by Doug Bradley as Pinhead. If you haven't seen this movie, I'll gladly let you borrow mine, don't even rent it...I'm sorry I bought it."
1,Hellraiser Inferno or Infernal?,"Hellraiser - InfernoIf you are looking for a continuation from the fantastic Clive Barker films, then think again. I watched to the end only to see if something exciting would happen, only to be disappointed. The acting was wooden at best. The star of the show - Pinhead - was great as always, but only in it for a total of a couple of minutes. The format was completely different than the original Hellraiser films, with little to do with the box. Would not recommend!"
4,"Its good, but is it Hellraiser?","After seeing the mixed blessings ... , I decided I would watch the film for myself. The storyline is good, but if, like others have said, you take out the 5 odd minutes of Pinhead, then this wouldn't necessarily be a Hellraiser movie. Although Pinhead didn't have a large role in the first 2 movies, the other characters held it together well. The same can't really be said here.If you're a diehard fan of the saga, then you may want to consider this a 3 or 2 star, as the Hellraiser theme is weak. But as a horror movie, it is a 4 star, because the story is intelligent and effective, but the characters are not as well acted as in other horror movies."
3,"Over 100 reviews for this film? Eh, its OK","Ever since Clive Barker stopped manning the helm for these films, the horror elements have gotten more ""psychological"" (lower budget). I am waiting for the inevitable ""PG-13"" Hellraiser film - the true death of this series.This straight-to-video-stores film about a puzzle-loving corrupt cop who stumbles upon the naughty puzzle-box has some gruesome horror elements, thank goodness, but I miss the old stuff: the plot where the main character out-tricks the cenobites, Pinhead in the forefront giving his speeches (ahh, the good old days).Inferno does manage to be watchable due to the use of key Hellraiser themes: examinations of the true nature of good and evil and some in-your-face horror.Its OK"
5,"""Welcome to Hell"" - Pinhead",This is the best film in the series besides the first 2 films! I rate this five stars out of 5
4,Has 'Hellraiser' gone to Hell?,"I decided to watch this movie because I was so mad at Dimension Films for lying about ""Bloodline"" being the last Hellraiser. I did a huge article on it for the school paper and got many good comments. Anyhoo, I liked this film for its simplicity. Nothing that took 3 or so years to make. Something simple and likeable. Dispite the fact that Pinhead is only in it for 4 minutes is nothing to be ashamed of. It's still a good film. But, no offense to Clive Barker, but, I would much rather not see Hellraiser or Pinhead come back ever again, unless of course Barker decides to take it back to where it was the first 4 movies. Otherwise, you lost a fan. I'm out."
5,"Not the best, but still excellent...","The first four Hellraiser movies were made by the original creator of hellraiser, Clive Barker. This one was not, as the next one isn't either. When I watched Hellraiser: Inferno, I have to admit I was impressed. This movie is much better than it is credited for, maybe even better than the first installment. It may not compare to 2,3,and 4 in the series, but this movie is worth buying. Do This movie takes an interesting twist on the series, making it different from the first four.not skip Hellraiser Inferno when buying the Hellraiser Series, because you will be missing a good movie."
4,Not bad at all...,"First of all, I am a huge Barker and Hellraiser fan ( excluding the atrocious Hellraiser 3 and 4). I had really low expectation regarding the fifth one so I was really surprised that I liked it! It may have Pinhead for a little while, and less gore and maybe be a little blasphemous to the original myth, but personally I forgive all these because this movie is well directed, very moody and atmospheric, nice photography and lighting, and tries to show you something new. How many horror sequels dare to do that??? This approach reminds a little of Lynch, Fincher and Jacobs Ladder and that was fine by me. Despite the myth and story flaws I believe that Clive should reconsider on his negative comments because of all it's other merits! On another note I really cannot see why to frown so much upon the way the Cenobites are treated here when on the previous sequels there were so many inventive ways that they were ridiculed !!"
2,different verison,"I would not advise anyone buying this film for more then five dollars. I do not think wrothy of first film at all, but it is my view."
3,A Different Kind Of Hellraiser Movie,"Hellraiser: Inferno is really more of a Pinhead film than a Hellraiser film in touch with the Clive Barker classics. The apprerance of Pinhead in the last five mintues was great. But thinking back to the first film and viewing this once again these films were inteneded to be about someone who sins and the price the have to pay. While the first two Hellraiser films were kinda about that, Part 3 & 4 were Pinhead's back this film stand own it one. While the film could have used some T& A it still makes one think"
2,Inferno,"I have seen all the Hellraiser from the real good first and second, to the mediocre third and fourth, but the fifth is by far the worst of the lot.. The story is confusing and not very interesting, in fact it is down right dull.."
2,Worst of the bunch!,"This film was such a bore. Ugh! What were they thinking? If I had bothered to really care I could tell you the plot, but it really does not matter. I'll give it 2 stars though for the Wire Twin cenobites and Torso. Even Pinhead cannot save this one."
3,Pinhead in a cowboy outfit? Say it isnt so,"After Hellraiser: Bloodline, Pinhead died or did he? This movie is good but it doesnt explain how Pinhead returns after he is killed off in Part 4. That was one major flaw with the film; It made the series into what I thought it couldnt-a cliched, horror film. Then Pinhead showed up in a cowboy outfit, and I wanted to cry. Im surprised they didnt have him cracking jokes like Freddy Kruger would. The movie is the worst of the series in my opinion. Well made thriller, but it shouldnt have been called Hellraiser."
1,Clive dissowned this movie as did Doug Bradley (pinhead),"Boring and trite the pointless tale follows a corrupt cop exploring the murder of a prostitute he was having sex with while in possession of the box. Some one thought they'd be clever by telling us at the end the that he was in hell the entire time and is doomed to repeat the event for eternity. Well, perhaps his M. Knight Shyamalan had written it, but alas no such luck.Pinhead appears for about 3 minutes at the close of the movie, if your still awake for it Doug Bradly certainly is the only thing worth watching here.It's finally happened, Hellraiser has fallen into the bin of made for video trash. DON'T BUY IT, DON'T RENT IT!"
1,What the Hell..........,"I would have rather watched grass grow or watch paint dry than to watch this movie ever again! Words cannot describe how bad this movie really is!!! This had to be a direct to video release because who would have paid to see this in the theater? If anyone paid more than$1.00 on this really wasted their money. This movie should'nt even be associated with the ""Hellraiser"" series.Pinhesd didn't even have to appear in this one because I was already in ""HELL"" just watching this!!!!!"
2,"An OK Movie, not the greatest","I am a HUGE fan of the Hellraiser series, but after seeing this film I was very let down. There were a few good moments in this movie, but it left me bored and wishing it would hurry up and end. This is prob. my least favorite out of the first five movies. I recommend you rent before you buy."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE PREVIOUS INSTALLMENTS.,"Over all,I thought this wasnt a good or bad movie.It was just mediocre and didnt do much for me.The story was alright but I thought the character of pin head shouldnt of been in the movie.Some people may like this movie and thats fine by me."
3,"Decent, but not really a Hellraiser film","I honestly think this film would have been recieved better if the Hellraiser title been taken off, and Pinhead removed (he is hardly in the film as is). As the film stands now, it is a good little horror film with a lot of nice twists. The acting is pretty good, and the production values are decent for a direct to video film. I would recomend this more as a rental, but don't expect Hellraiser, but still something freaky."
3,"Extreme Lack of series, but a decent movie","I caught the advanced version of this as I work at a video store. The storyline is weak and confusing, and the overall following of the Hellraiser series isn't that great either. This movie would be a great start for a Hellraiser television series but all in all not a great movie. If you have to see it either rent it or get the DVD. It's definately not worth $100 you can wait"
3,Pretty good!,"I really love The Moffatts, so I buy everything of thiers. This was a pretty good book, more photo's than information. If you are a Moffatt fan, I'd say, BUY IT!"
5,This Rocks! Buy it now! Don't wait get it!,"It is practically written by them and they look amazing in the pics. if you are a obbessed fan or just like them alot GET IT! The pictures are so cute! It gives great info, and it's a must have. I already recomended it to one of my friends. You will NOT regret buying this. Come on Buy it do it for the moffatts!"
2,Total rip-off....don't buy it.,This book is full of garbage. The pictures are old and the so-called facts are all lies. It's a pathetic attempt at an autobiography.
5,Totally kickin'!,This is a really awesome book with great pics. A definite MUST for any Moffatt fan. Lots of info on these four fab guys from Canada.
5,rollovers and buttons,I was looking for more examples about how buttons and rollovers work in Fireworks and this book helped. I like the screenshots to help follow steps in examples.
3,Itasca Searay,"This shoe was very tight when first worn. It has stretched a bit as I have worn it, but I would have returned it immediately if the next size up had been available. I had purchased the previous year's version of this shoe which was snug initially and stretched quickly as wornto become an extremely comfortable shoe. I have high hopes for this model as I continue to wear it for short spans hoping to stretch it and have it conform to the same comfortable style as the previous shoe I purchased."
3,Historically Informative.,The Welsh Terrier Lead The Way has a good handle on the historical aspects of the dog. However the lack of quality photos distracts from the beauty of the breed and the many wonderful characteristics are blurred by the black and white photos. The book contains many old photos from past champions and breeders but does not contain the in depth information that many people who are interested in the breed are looking for. If you are interested primarily in the dogs history then this is a good book for you.
5,A poetic & hilarious homage.,"A poetic & hilarious homage to silent German expressionist cinema.Well worth watching every five years. If you can see a fresh B&W print at a decent public movie theater, do so. Wonderful photography. Until then, video is OK. And keep a good dictionary (ie ""Bible"") by your side. It's a dark world; you'll need it."
1,Ultimate film for quintessential pseudos,"A silly, ugly, pretentious, inept, embarrassing, shallow, dreary film that was dated the day it was made."
2,Zeroville,"Lemmy says it best when he tells Natascha ""This is Zeroville."" I had looked forward to seeing this film after the glowing reviews by those who claimed it ""tackled"" tough topics, and ""sent critics running."" Well, I guess I am among the critics. There's nothing mysterious about this venture, except the worship of it. It's a windy tale of love versus technology. Love wins. Yay! In between, a computer who sounds like Sartre after a tracheotomy narrates weak poetry. What an overblown sack of hash."
2,J.L.Godard is a FALSE PROPHET in cinemathography!,"I like some of the Godard movies (Breathless,Contempt).But most of them I don't like at all,and he made a lot of them.To my mind he is one of the most overated film makers in the history of cinema.""Alphaville"" is the best proof of this.Except some nice B/W pfotography it has nothing in it.It's like an ungifted amateur's first try.It may sound funny to his devotees but to me TINTO BRASS IS A MUCH SUPERIOR DIRECTOR than this French pseudo-intellectual of cinema.I read that Ingmar Bergman despised him and after watching many of Godard's movies I can really understand why.I.Bergman is right for 100%."
1,Raised eyebrow,"Archetypal Godard with strange, symbolic behavior substituting for a plot, and cryptic, philosophical declarations substituting for dialog.This one starts out like a spy thriller but by the 30 minute mark, it had declared it's dystopian theme. Beneath the confusion there's a message that would make Capt Kirk happy -- that emotions are superior to analytical thought. And love is the best of all.Spock would have raised his eyebrow at this one."
1,Overrated,"For those that but purely on reading reviews - be warned. Watch it before buying. I found this to be a hyped-up pretentious mess. Exceedingly dull and frankly, annoying."
1,"Beware, this movie is unwatchably dull","This movie is rated 5 stars because a small following of fans clearly think it is cool -- or think they are cool for watching these self-indulgent French art films. But beware! Chances are you will find this film unwatchably dull. It looks like it was made for about $1000, with actors hired off the street. Special effects include long scenes of people walking thru steam tunnels, and an evil supercomputer consisting of a lamp set behind a slowly turning electric fan."
1,One the century's ten worst movies!,"I do not understand why all those other reviews are so positive about this movie, because it has to be the most boring movie I have ever seen. It is slow, the story does not make any sense whatsoever, and contains countless conversations about the meaning of life. Just Plain Stupid. This would only appeal to Hardcore French movies lovers, i.e. 1% of the population at best (I happen to be French, by the way). If you enjoy US Sci-Fi movies, then do not watch this because it is so different that you will probably stop watching after 10 minutes. I almost did, and afterwards I wish I had. This was a waste of my time."
2,A Review,"I rented this movie and thought my TV was not working because the color was all faded and I turned the knobs and the dials but I still could not get the color to work. So I think this movie has real bad color. At any rate it has a guy named Lemmy who says, ""Lemme tell you this and lemme tell you that!"" and he was always telling me things even when his lips were not moving. And then he meets a pretty girl but she just kind of walks around in the movie really bored until Mister Lemmy says, ""Lemme introduce you to the director. He is French!""And then Lemmy talks to a light bulb. A really big light bulb. And the light bulb talks back.Well Lemmy tell you this! One star for the pretty girl. One star for the talking light bulb.But zero stars for the color."
3,a weird film and quite interesting,This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.This film which is one of several involving the character Lemmy Caution remains popular to this day as one of the few science fiction films with no special effects. It is a good view of a technocratic society an has elements which at the time seemed like fantasy but in our computer age seems more feasible.The film also has a voice over that is really deep and raspy that sounds very interesting.The DVD does not have any special features but still is a good one to buy.
1,Wrong Item,The item that was received was not even close to what I ordered. I was sent an adapter with a female plug instead of a male plug. This style is NOT compatible with the Atari 2600. It is also not what is pictured.
4,Terrific progressive acoustic Jazz,"Is it just me, or are women taking over Jazz? Maybe it's about time. Myra Melford is a formidable pianist with interesting ideas. Like a TRUE Jazz player, she understands the tradition without apeing it. She has worked with some greats, including Henry Threadgill, and you can hear his influence on her work. I also hear a fair bit of Cecil Taylor in her playing, but her style is more lyrical and less percussive, and I dare say she has better chops than the old master.I like her as a clever composer and a leader as well as a pianist, and the other players on this eclectic album acquit themselves very well, but it is principally for the beautiful flow of her playing that I listen to it. That said, she does a fine job of balancing improvisation and structure, and that is non trivial (John Zorn does this extremely well, as does Threadgill), and so the ensemble aspects of this album are well worth a listen."
5,Intensity,"The intensity of the musicians makes this necessary music...Myra has digested Cecil Taylor (among others!), and it's nice to hear someone besides Matthew Shipp who has done so. Great music, acknowledging the past while pushing into the future."
1,"the bad software , dont try it","i have bought this test software from amazon and beleive me i dont advice anyone to buy it because it is not user friendly first compared to gelim second it doenst have enough questions to practive , question are limited and not in a good standing ,..."
2,Pretty Useless,"I'm glad this is the first review of this book. It probably means that not too many have been sold. That's a good thing!I guess this is intended to be more of a history book of canning rather than a practical guide. The receipes are interesting, but then you get these useless instructions to pack in sterilized jars and seal.There are no instructions for sealing! Should it be 15 minutes in a boiling water bath? or 10 minutes in a pressure canner at 10 lbs or 15 lbs? Oh, maybe we should use paraffin or rubber rings.Basically, this is a charming book about preserving, but is not intended for practical use."
5,Malo Box Set,"I have been waiting for the CD version of Malo's LPs released back in the 70's. For those into Malo and Jorge Santana, this is a must have collection. My favorite album is Ascension, all the songs are nice and ""No Matter"" stands out with Jorge's quite lengthy & melodic guitar solo. This is a good example that the man has a good feel to express his guitar solo backed by great line up of musicians and horns section as well. Viva Malo!"
1,Not much for the money,"I'm surprised this book got any positive reviews. For $20, it sold me information I can get anywhere else. It should have been a $3 pamphlet or a free giveaway. I can get a real decorating book with color photos and tips for $20. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this rundown of decorator terms. As a Gen Y new homeowner, I'm pretty careful with my money. Unfortunately, I blew it on this one."
1,I'm angry that I bought this,"I buy a lot of decorating books, but this one doesn't even live up to its name. I thought I was buying a handy little decorating book to take with me when I shop, but that isn't what I received. This book is an encyclopedia of decorating and furniture terms. That's all it is. There is nothing in here that is helpful to me as I shop for decorating products. If I need a listing of terms, I can go to the dictionary, for heaven's sake. So, this isn't a Pocket Decorating Guide but a Pocket Dictionary. How that is supposed to help me decorate my home, I can't imagine."
1,"No color photos, no advice, just an illustrated glossary","I just bought a gorgeous hard-back color book on The New Cottage Home, and I'm in love with it. Great photography, lots of good information. It's dreamy, and I know I'll use it a lot as we plan our new home. It cost a little over $20. On the other hand, with that new home in mind I also bought this Pocket Decorator, and I was so disappointed with it. For about the same money, the Pocket Decorator is small and has only a few no-color illustrations of furniture pieces in it. It's a kind of illustrated glossary of furnishings. How can one publisher afford to give me so much for my money while another one gives me what amounts to a glossary for about the same money? I truly believe I was cheated by the Pocket Decorator, and now I understand why some amazon book buyers are angry about having purchased it."
1,Doesn't do what it promises,"If this were a Pocket Decorator, as its title says, I would be thrilled. But it is a pocket dictionary of decorating terms. Hardly the same thing. I can't find anything that is practical or helpful in this book. Other decorating books I have name and define terms as part of their writing about how to decorate. This book doesn't help me decorate. It only names the terms. I feel cheated. This book goes into the next local charity book sale. I'll never pick it up again myself."
1,A Pocket Dictionary for Those Who Know Nothing,"This book is nothing more than definitions of basic items. I mean basic. The part of the book on ceilings gives short ( a couple sentences) definitions for 4 different types of ceilings - cathedral, tin, tray, and wood-beam. The rest of the book is equally basic. A better title for the book would be ""A Pocket Dictionary for Those Who Know Nothing about Decorating"". And don't let the ""illustrated"" part mislead you. Only half the items in the book are illustrated. The chapter on fabric has not a single illustration!! Don't let the other positive reviews fool you like they did me."
1,Fake positive reviews? I think so,"I have to concur with a reader who questioned whether the authors were writing their own positive reviews. One positive review of this thin little book says refers to his or her often-used, ""dog-eared"" copy of the book. The book only came out in mid- to late June of this year -- a few days ago. How could it be well-used and dog-eared already? I picked this up at the book store and put it back after leafing through it. I can get this info from the encyclopedia that's built into my computer. I don't need to pay $20 for it."
1,I am sorry I bought this,"I couldn't believe how little I got for my money on this book. If I were studying decorating, then I believe that I might like to have this little ""cheat sheet"" (for that is all it is) of design terms and what they mean. After I thumbed through this a few times and kicked myself for having bought it, I found information about the authors in the back. They aren't writers but decorators, which explains a lot. It explains the dull prose, and it also explains why they put their decorators' blinders on and assumed that those of us not in that line of work might actually be interested in this drab rundown of arcane decorating terms. I'm into decorating, but do I really care about the difference between a bergere and a fauteuil? Absolutely not."
5,This is what it seems--and that's good!,"To all the people on here who are complaining this book is ""not what it seems,"" did you not read the product description? This is an encylcopedia, it says so itself. And it is a good one at that. It's got all the terms, many illustrations, and is a great tool to refer to for quick answers. It's very helpful when learning about the basics. No, it's not going to show you how to decorate your living room--it gives you information for you to do that yourself.There are many many decorating books that have full page glossy pictures of other people's designs. This is not one, nor does it claim to be. This is something to help individuals make educated choices about their OWN styles.It's an extremely good book and shouldn't be judged against things that are not in the same category."
5,Great Design Tool!!,"I already have a few books that show different ideas, glossy photos of dream houses. But I needed a tool to help me put together MY dream house-- and this is it. It helped me locate the exact finish for the floor, and find the title for the chairs that I saw in one of the other books. Its to help you make your own house exactly how you want it."
2,I wanted it to be better,"I wanted to really like this book--it had a great sounding premise, that's why I bought it without checking with other book readers first. I had to force myself to read until the end. I found the way the characters went from one reality to the next to be unbelievable. Also, I didn't get to know and care about the characters."
4,Very Interesting Concept,"This book was very interesting and it made me want to keep reading. However, I thought that the author introduced too many plot points that were unresolved by the end of the book. The ending was still good, but it left me with some questions. I did not realize until I began to write this review that this is the first book in a trilogy, so maybe these questions will be resolved in the next two books. When I finished the book, I was not looking for a sequel; I just wanted a few plot points wrapped up a bit. Now that I know there are two more books, I am not sure how I feel, and I am not sure if I will read them.I also wanted to note this book has a decent amount of language. Most of it is British swear words (Actually, that is how I figured out that the story was taking place in the UK. Is that sad?), so I was not particularly offended by it because I, as an American, have not been conditioned to do so, but I know that others might be."
5,AWESOME!,This is one of the best books ever written. Period. I read it in two days flat. It's that good. There is enough suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end!
2,These don't last,We have had two of these... bought one and it stopped working within the first two weeks. We exchanged it and we have had the second one for about 9 months and it also has stopped working... Don't buy this machine... it is not reliable.
1,Works in fits and starts,"We bought this to replace a DVD player and a VCR that were destroyed in a flood. It worked fine for the first 9 months, but since then has gone downhill steadily. While playing a DVD, it will stop as if reading the disk and then jump ahead--and the longer you view the DVD, the more frequent and the longer the interruptions. I'm very disappointed with this and feel it was a waste of money."
4,Quite useful to have when playing,This is a good guide to have if there is a race that you would like help with. I recommend that those who are going to want to play the game get this guide as it does help and it has very nice maps of the races. I thought that the guide should have more info on the various vehicles though.
5,Creamy milk chocolate fudge with fresh walnuts... delicious!,Creamy milk chocolate fudge loaded with fresh walnuts! Perfect for any occasion... order yours today!
5,A Beutiful Little Story,"This little story paralleled my little 3-yr. old daughter's daily routine, right down to her helping daddy stir the oatmeal for breakfast and spinning around in the yard!We've come to cherish this story that has been a quiet reminder to both my daughter and myself to remember all the little things for which to thank our Heavenly Father.Thank you."
5,Comfortable and ligtweight,"The matress is rather light, and the sleeping bag goes over it without a problem. The zippers are strong, and even though the pump is not silent, it's still very quiet. Unlike other models, the pump can not be used to fine tune the firmness of the matress, and it must be removed while using the bed.Makes for a fine sleeping arrangement for a guest, or while waiting for a new matress to be delivered."
2,not at all what i expect from disch,"Let me just say that I really like Tom Disch's work. Most of the time. But this collection isn't at all what I expect out of Disch, quality-wise. Section one contained a charming poem about the Nativity and then a dense, confusing masque. Section three was just baffling and I'm not exactly sure what Disch was trying to pull off there. The regular poems were in sections two and four and they weren't up to what I'm used to seeing out of this poet. While I like the poet, I didn't like teh book."
4,good remixes............... i need help,hello people music lovers....the pop version is really good but i'd rather the sander kleinenberg's remix off course i'm a dj so that's the reason why i liked it so much. and the oakenfold version is good too but it is juts like another style of him. it look's like break beat or somethig like that.i really need help with something i want to konw ho's the artist who made the original disco version i think is of chic but i really coudn't find it please help me people thank all of you.
3,"Good mixes, but not enough of them","This is a good set of remixes. First there's the album version. The Sander Kleinenberg mix is a little funky, a little, trancy, a little housey. Different feel, but good...but TOO short! It's just the ""radio edit."" The Paul Oakenfold mix is a little longer, but still short. It feels more like the original version, with a slightly different bassline (I've been hearing this version on the radio). And finally there's an instrumental of the album version that does retains Justin's beat box vocal part.There are more mixes of this song to be had...and they should be released on CD single...the video version alone is longer than the LP version and should have been on here!"
2,"Not too good, annoying","Alright, i listen mostly to rock, rap, and reggae but i do like several other kinds of music. I admit to likeing a couple of NSYNC songs and i liked Justin Timberlakes first two singles, ""Like I Love You"", and ""Cry Me A River"". This does not excuse Justin from this annoying garbage. It was played out on Fitness commercials! its horrible, with on redeeming quality, its somehwat catchy chorus. other then that the song is boring and annoying. get his other singles instead or the whole ""Justified"" album."
2,"Take ""Rock With You"" By MJ And Add ""Too Close"" By Next...","and u get ""Rock Your Body"" by Michael Jack-...I mean Justin Timberlake who went from frizzy haired male pop tart to bald MJ impersonator. ""Rock Your Body"" and is just too similar to too many other songs, yet it's become hit only bucuz he's Justin. I gave it two stars though due to the fact that I have some fond memories connected to it involving friends of mine. If you MUST buy a Justin song, go with ""Cry Me A River."" Justin....go away. Take your music with you."
2,still having those michael jackson fantasies are we not,if only michael jackson did these songs oh well keep trying justin maybe one day you'll outsell thriller.
1,"Cranky Reveiwer, how old are you?","That's right, Justin has one star from me and here's why. In your rating on this God-awful sing;e you said that Micheal Jackson, Stevie Wonder, and a few others influenced from Justin Timberlake? I believe you are wrong sweetie! For the simple fact that when Stevie released his first single, Justin wasn't even a seed in his fathers t*st*cles, when MJ came out with his debut, Justin was still wetting his diapers. And to say he invented soul is like saying Jay-Z invented Rock & Roll with the Rolling Stones! It's like my mother always said, ""Only fools speak foolish things."" And you Cranky Reviewer are by far the biggest fool. Pick up a Stevie Wonder cd and educate yourself!"
2,"Sorry, Bebo.","I own all of Bebo Norman's CDs, and I LOVE all of them, except for this one. I bought it and listened to it once, and I hated it. It does not sound like Bebo. This sounds like Steven Curtis Chapman or Michael W. Smith or any of the other mass produced Christian/pop music artists. On all of his previous albums, even though he changed his sound slightly, it was still generally very acoustic and Bebo-ish. This album sounds nothing like his previous music. I was disappointed."
5,My favorite song is on this album...,"When I hear the words, ""Your beloved needs you now"" I feel as if that song was written directly for the needs of my heart. Thank you, Bebo Norman, for uplifting me. You have a beautiful voice with a beautiful message. God bless."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"I love contemporary christian music, especially praise and worship, but I was a little disappointed in this CD. I've heard Bebo Norman before and like some of his music, but I had only heard one song on this CD. Besides that one song, there was only one other that I liked. It probably just isn't my kind of music."
5,A story you won't be able to put down.....,"A vivid account of the Brannon family swept up in the choas of a war on the horizon. James Reasoner is a gifted writer with a knack for making you care deeply for his characters. Reasoner always holds a special place in his heart for the common man caught up in extraordinary events and times! His books will grab you by the throat and not let you go until all the way through. While there is just a little on the battle of Manassas at the end of the book, the events leading up to it will keep you turning the pages. My only complaint is there were really no good stopping points where I could put it down! I was compelled to keep on reading and found to my dismay that the book ended long before I was ready! I am now reading the second book and encourage James to write faster. I'm going to need that third book pretty soon and I have to know what is going to happen next to these well crafted characters. Don't miss out on this exciting series if you love to read!"
4,A good fun read. Leaves the reader waiting for more.,"Manassas was a fun book to read. Wish there had been a little more focus on the battle of Manassas as the title indicated, but the story leading up to the battle is well written and enjoyable. The characters are fairly vivid and one really gets into their lives. The end of the book is spectacular and made me want to order the next in the series, Shiloh, right away. I am now half way through and find it even better than Manassas, but would not want to read it without having read Manassas first. I am looking forward to the rest of the series."
2,Manassas (The Civil War Battle Series Book 1),To me the book was a complete disappointment. Maybe I expected too much. I didn't realize when I purchased the book that it was a novel. The book is 336 pages long and the only part about the Battle of Manassa was in the last 30 pages. I was interested in some historical background on the Battle of Manassas and not the dealings of a southern farming family.
3,Slow reading,Haven't finished this book yet and may never finish it. Slow moving and much to much conversation. So there you have it!
5,Very pleased with this Seller.,"The book was new as listed, great price and it came very quickly. I am very pleased with this seller!"
1,What a disappointment !,"I had high hopes for this series but Book 1 was pretty much a waste of time and I won't even look at the next. Mr. Reasoner needs to stay with his westerns. Obviuosly he knows little or nothing about Virginia and little about the Civil War. Culpepper didn't have several ""saloons"" in the 1860's, maybe a tavern or two, there weren't gun fights between the sheriff and bad guys, Confederate flags didn't appear the first day Culpepper heard about the war, abolishinist gangs didn't attack or threaten Southern rallys in Richmond, etc. He also needs an editor to correct the story lines."
5,Have Tissues Ready!,This is a very touching story. I was surprised that a child's book would have me in tears LOL! Carmen Deedy is an excellent author and once again she has written a brilliant book! Beautifully written with gorgeous illustrations.
2,This book was not very helpful.,"One good thing about the book: it doesn't take long to get through it. Out of 125 pages, only 25 contain helpful content. The rest consists of 2 practice tests and answers. There all also very generous margins and wide spacing. Overall, there just isn't a lot of book here. During those 25 pages, the author explains the solutions to the ""before"" test, which does make it likely that you'll do better on the ""after"" test. I was hoping for generalized rules and strategies that would show one how to attack the sort of problems that crop up in an IQ test. There were some, but not as many as I had hoped. Also, I don't know how representative these questions were. Overall, I found the book somewhat helpful, but disappointing."
3,"""Clearly the answer is...???""","Q: 2 is to 4 as 4 is to ? (16, 30, 8, 12)A: ""Clearly the answer is 8.""The above is taken as an excerpt from the book. But isn't 2 the squareroot of 4? And therefore with 4 being the squareroot of 16, isn't 2 is to 4 as 4 is to 16? Clearly the answer is not ""Clearly 8"". I am searching for a book filled with true logic challenges, not frustrating assumption and ignorance. Can somebody please recommend?"
1,Confusing?,I had trouble understanding this book. I'm not sure exactly what was going on. What was real and what was imaginary. I'm not sure what the author was trying to say either. I felt like I was missing the message but I'd have trouble reading it again. The plot (?) started well and the story kept me interested simply by the fact that I was hoping I would figure out what was going on. The ending still left me confused and wondering.
1,boring,"I started reading Jonathan Lethem with _As She Climbed Across the Table_ which I thought was funny, sharp, tho small . I've sense read ALL Jonathan Lethem books in hopes to finding an equal or better book. I found nothing but acid trip/opiate dream garbage/drivel. All overly detailed and quite boring, lacking in story. Stupid stuff. The only book of Jonathan Lethems I'd recommend is _As She Climbed Across the Table."
2,HUH???,"This book IS going to have a sequel, right? Right??? It makes absolutely no sense otherwise!!!"
2,"readable, not fulfilling","I would have put this book down early into it if I had known how poorly it concluded. Forgive my need for closure, but I think its almost universally appreciated. The denouement wasn't the only aspect lacking; the writing was sub-par. Granted, the characters were interesting, and some of the ideas were original, but not everything original is worth putting to paper. Lethem lacked flow. This novel was selected for what looked to be promising escapism literature, a world that I could be sucked into to forget my own for a little while. However, it wasn't much of a world, and was difficult to hold onto. Other reviewers have praised the dream-like structure of it, claiming that its lack of flow was in keeping with the characters' fragmented dream-like state. Less than dream-like, it was more like a poor night's sleep. I rarely give poor reviews, but I just want others to be forwarned. If your time is valuable, then spend it looking for a different book."
3,One of the strangest books I have ever read,"'Amnesia Moon' is confusing, at times it is hard to tell whether it is talking in metaphors or the actual scene. But overall it is satisfieng."
2,ultimately unsatisfying,"When I started reading this book, it seemed really interesting to me. I thought the ideas that were being dimly outlined were intriguing, and I wanted to delve into them. Unfortunately, the longer I read this book, the more frustrating it became.The actions of the main charcter, Everett Chaos Moon, were nonsensical at best. He is perpetually confused, but barely manages to ever muster up any interest in really figuring things out. He comes off as a someone who doesn't make sense, because on the one hand he's trying to understand himself and the world, and on the other hand he's never making any effort to do just that. He just kinda floats along in the incoherent world pointlessly.By the end of the book, I was disgusted and irritated with the whole thing, and I felt like the ending gave me absolutely nothing for me efforts. This is the only Lethem book I've read, and it seriously discourages me from wanting to read any others."
2,"Good ideas, but VERY loose ends...sigh.","It is a shame really. I picked up this book for a single dollar at a discount bookstore, and although I thought that the read was quick, interesting, and sucked you into the lives of the characters, I really would *not* recommend this book to anyone. The book, hardcover, is a stunted 247 pages. What it needed was an ENDING. I was in the last 50 pages wondering, like I usually do, ""Okay...here's where it all comes together...where he/she/it/they do such-and-such to cure the ills of the world, or at least to escape."" But no such escape is possible, for the ending not only left EVERY character hanging on by some macabre silken string from a tapestry poorly woven, but also never really concluded. It was like Lethem fell asleep, and never bothered to write the last chapter. Well, I fell asleep, too. Sorry, Jonathan, but no more reading your work for me until you wake up."
2,"disappointment after ""Motherless Brooklyn""","Lethem had me in stitches with ""Motherless Brooklyn."" After reading this, I found I had two more Lethem on the basement bookshelves. Chose to read ""Amnesia Moon"" next. Quite a disappointment! While I do get into sci-fi, this was a major let- down. The characters were not interesting to me, the situation was not novel, and I found myself drifting off to the other book I was reading (tending to put off this one). I'm going to give him one more chance ""As She Climbed Across the Table"" hoping that he redeems himself. I want to like him. Maybe then I can buy ""Gun with Occasional Music."" I am a novice at sci-fi (Neil Gaiman is my hero) so maybe I am not a trustworthy reviewer."
4,"Amazing, Vertiginous Tour de Force","What an amazing accomplishment is this book. It is simultaneously funny and sad, familiar yet very strange, and it moves along with a predictable rhythm while never actually going where you expect. Ever.Lethem has written some of the most inventive novels I've ever read -- ""Girl in Landscape,"" ""As She Climbed Across The Table,"" ""Motherless Brooklyn"" -- and he's just as creative here. His characters and the situations he puts them in ride the knife-edge between absolute believability and (some kind of) science fiction outlandishness, but it's to Lethem's credit that you never lose your attachments to his cast.The twists in this book -- which if you've read it you know about, and if not I couldn't BEGIN to explain them to you -- rank it right up with ""Girl"" for audacity. I was reminded of the movie ""Being John Malkovich"" or some of Fellini's work perhaps. Definitely the work of a major talent, both in scope and skill. His writing is so good it gave me vertigo."
3,Weak for a lethem novel,"Having devoured most of the lethem novels, i found this to be his weakest - the tops being Gun, with occasional music and Motherless Brooklyn. Yes, it's interesting and fantastical but if you are looking for any hidden meaning as people reading it have been i think you are out of luck. The ending explains the point of the novel and that is the annoying part as it is weak and sappy. I gave it a 3 as it wasn't a complete waste of time as he is such a talented writer and maybe the ending won't bother some people. However, if you haven't read American Gods by Neil Gaiman i would suggest spending the time reading it instead."
1,3 short stories loosely knit together,This is little more than 3 loosely associated stories cobbled together with an unreasonably unexplained set of circumstances and a hasty bad ending with too many unanswered questions.Hope the author isn't banking on selling the movie rights....Pass on this one - wouldn't waste my time on it.
2,fair cartoon,"This movie remided me of how great the film ""The incrediable Mr. Limpet"" is. This is basically the same thing, but a poor copy. It is about a boy, or in this care two boys and a girl, turning into fish. The rest of the story is about how they try to get the potion back from the evil fish so they can turn back to humans. All before the potion makes the evil fish more human and more evil. This movie has a weak story, jumps all over the place, is filled with sterotypical charaeters and horrible songs. I saw it when i was on a cruise, and basically in the room with the choice of only three movie channels which each ran the same 3 movies over and over."
1,Great movie just bad disc,I ordered this as a christmas gift for my mother cause she loves this movie. It was delivered on time and everything but when I opened up the box and picked up the dvd case you could hear the disc moving inside. Once i shook it and heard the disc moving around I knew it was going to be scratched. Contacted Amazon that day and was refunded within an hour. Opened the disc after and it was all scratched up. Such a dissappointment cause I really wanted to get my mom this movie.Great Movie 4.5 starsRuined disc 1 star
5,great movie,i first saw this movie on hallmark ch and wait for december to get here to see it now i can watch it any time i want to.i cant wait to order more of the hallmark holiday movies.
4,Enjoyable Christmas Sentimentality!,"When the mood strikes, I can require Christmas any time of year! Moonlight and Mistletoe is perfect for just those moments, because as obvious as the plot twists are -- there's a great deal here to renew your spirits and belief in happy times ahead. In a rough economy when so many people are feeling the economic pinch, we can relate to this enjoyable story of a Christmas wonderland that has fallen on hard times.Can Santaland be saved by the hard-nosed businesswoman, her father's dreams of renewal... and what about the dastardly villain looking to gain control by any trickery possible? There's even a little romance thrown in for good measure!Moonlight and Mistletoe has just enough going for it to make it a worthy addition to your DVD collection."
2,Golden Lies not so golden,"I downloaded this for the free cost and the storyline had some promise, but overall the writing was so pedestrian and overdone that I couldn't enjoy it. Each character's motivations and feelings were so over described and each character's viewpoint was identical in tone, phrasing, grammar, etc.I did like the San Francisco setting and some attempt to look at interracial issues, but none of the characters was more than the usual romance fiction stereotype. I will definitely pass up on any more books by Barbara Freethy."
4,Light and fluffy,"The plot is ridiculous, but it's an enjoyable escape from reality. A well written romance with a tinge of mystery. Absolutely worth a couple of dollars!"
2,I got what I paid for. . .,"I was looking for a cheapie book for my kindle and this one had an interesting recap and mostly positive reviews, so I spent the big bucks (less than 2 of them) to download this. It is not horrible, I did actually finish the whole book. But in my opinion, it is just not written very well. When I am reading a really good book, I get wrapped up in the story, the characters come to life. When I read this book, I noticed every painstakingly pointless description of what characters looked like and what they were wearing, and how sexy they looked in whatever they had on. Yes, I know that character description is important, but it should be seamlessly written into the story - I shouldn't cringe while I am reading it. It was awkward writing - just not very good. Nothing I would recommend or read again, and I most certainly would not read anything else this author wrote."
3,Golden Lies,"I have read a couple of Barbara Freethy books and found them to be ok but nothing I would rave about. There are parts of the book that really holds my interest but there are many that I feel I have to drudge through to get to the meaty parts. I don't feel like I really get to know the characters like I do with some other authors, such as Diane Chamberlain. They're just names on a page and easily forgotten. As I said, it was ok and the price was good."
5,excellent story,could not put this book down. wondering what the characters are up to now that i have finished the book. barbara freethy i love your writing and thank you
4,Quite enjoyable,"She cares for her characters. I see from some of the other reviews that she's written more involving stories, which I'm sure is probably true."
3,Only Just OK,"It was free. It was well-reviewed and popular in the lists. The look-inside was promising but the story was a let down.Flat characters and a plot that just faded out after the first few chapters. It took me ages to get through it because I kept losing interest.The setting worked well, however and the premise was quite interesting - at least to start with - but it hasn't made me want to read any more from this writer, sadly. If I'm honest, it's a bit of a stretch to give it 3*."
3,Involved,"This was an interesting story. Though not my usual style of story, I did read through to the end. Happy I did."
4,"Good, tight mystery","For months, I have been hearing plaintive squeaks from my kindle: ""Read me! Read ME!"" It took awhile to work out where they were coming from but I am so glad I finally realised which novel was being so noisy!A strong plot and good, tight writing made it a great read. The three main characters are strong, but do not over power each other, ensuring a cohesive unit. As with so many mysteries, the answer lies in a past which involves family, culture and many secrets, of which the outcome is near tragedy.I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and read it in one night. Couldn't put it down, in fact :)"
5,Enjoyed Reading,"Golden Lies got my attention at the beginning and kept it all through the story. Trying to figure out the ""who done it"" and why kept me reading on and on. I am a long time Barbara Freethy reader and thoroughly enjoy her books."
1,"Long, Painful Slog through San Francisco","I'm glad I picked this up for free, because I'd be kicking myself if I'd paid for it. The author focuses more on an unconvincing mystery than on characterization, everyone is shrouded and ""complicated"", but sort of cardboard, and the romance between the two couples is forced and boring.According to my Kindle I am 64% through the story, and I STILL couldn't care any less what happens to any of the characters, or what the ultimate answer to the mystery is. I kind of hope they ARE all cursed, because I am that bored and irritated with the entire story. I doubt I'll bother to finish this."
2,Golden Lies,"Your typical harlequin romance, with a little deeper plot. It was OK for entertainment. The mystery kept me reading this one."
3,Quite a sweet story,I read to the end without feeling desperately keen on it but still enjoyed my time. It felt like a good script for a B grade movie. Some may say a good holiday book.
3,Golden Lies Review,"This is an entreating novel, good passing the time reading.Not too much to learn but entertaining and fun to read."
4,Romantic Mystery,Golden Lies kept my interest. It was fun trying to solve the mystery and adding a romance to it made it a bit more interesting. A good book just to pick up and read at my leisure. The characters were well defined and I didn't have to constantly go back to see who I was reading about. Interesting plot.
4,Wonderful read,"Barbara Freethy does a great job of hooking you in to her stories immediately in the beginning and keeping you hooked throughout the whole story. Fast moving from beginning to end. I'm learning a great deal about northern California and the San Francisco area where she sets a lot of her books. Her characters are flawed human beings in many ways but always interesting. I gave this book four stars only because it didn't have the emotional depth of her Daniel's Gift. It was also inexpensive to purchase for my Kindle, which I really liked.Kindle Wireless Reading Device, Wi-Fi, Graphite, 6"" Display with New E Ink Pearl Technology"
2,obvious mystery. Boring romance.,"Golden LiesThis was an ok read. The mystery was kind of obvious. The romance was forced. I'm not sure why the characters thought they loved each other when they really didn't like esch other. Every one of them had so many issues and resentment with the other, it was hard to find them likable."
4,Golden Lies,This is the first book I have read by this author. It was an enjoyable read with a good dose of romance and intrigue. The tug of war between the two main characters and the suspense keeps you reading to the end. I will definately read another of her books.
3,ok read,"I like Barbara Freethy. I've read ""Ryan's return"" and ""Love will find a way"" and I thought they were better. I like the plot of this one but it seemed to drag on. I just didn't connect with the main characters enough to make it a page turner."
1,Boring,"This book is borderline awful. Unrealistic characters, predictable beyond belief, and not compelling at all. The preview may look ok, but it is downhill from there. Don't waste your money."
3,Golden Lies,"Golden Lies has an interesting Chinese plot with good character descriptions. The main male ""Reilly"" is however an arrogant jerk throughout the entire book, not intended by the author. Like so many novels too many pages droned on an on with no interesting or significant information. The ending had a rather surprise even though very complicated. Everyone always go to bed immediately. Fornication is the accepted norm with no consequences ever revealed. Lynn Berntson"
3,Unsettled but poignant,"This is a revealing look at San Francisco and some very interesting characters. But it wasn't satisfying the way a romance novel should be. Loose ends and pat answers left me with more questions than I'm comfortable having after reading good fiction. I hoped for more resolution but the artwork was intriguing, the characters believable, and the geographic descriptions made me feel like I was in San Francisco."
3,"very soap opera-y, like ""dynasty""- but in a good way....","a real page turner, as they say. and soapy as can be....it's all here: drama, games between family members, loyalty, pain, suspicion, doubt, and all kinds of love- romantic, familial, love for art and the mysterious joy it can bring.....i did enjoy it and this could actually be considered a ""beach read"". at the end of the book, i started to think more about the plot and said to myself, ""hey, wait a minute"".....no matter- it's involving, and the characters are pretty well drawn. it's not ""pride and prejudice"", but it does keep your interest. really 3 & 1/2 stars, if amazon would one day allow 1/2 stars to the ratings."
4,Another great story by Freethy,Golden Lies is another great read by Freethy. It's a fast read that is filled with mystery and suspense to keep it going. I got it on my husband's nook and he even read it and liked it.
4,Must Read,"What a great story line. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and hope that the author considers a sequel. Full of action, mystery, and romance. I recommend it highly and I will be checking out more from this author."
4,A Good Read,This is the first book I have read by this author. I would read more by this author. Loved the San Franscisco local where the story takes place.
1,a good book on a bad story,"I shall not discuss Ms Lynn's writing skills: one page melts into the other and her style is always smooth, delicate, sober; her phrasing deceivingly simple, sometimes even lyrical.It is a writing made of small touches, light shades, always convincing if not always moving.The problem here lies with the story: hard as I tried I could not get involved nor get to love her characters.We have here a love sick young artist, doomed by cancer to die early in a world where an intimidating science nearly always guarantees a healthy, long lasting life. This device, if a bit cerebral, could in itself be touching but in this case it left me cold.I wanted to feel for the main hero, his lost lover being another man should have helped me identifying, but I simply could not.It seems to me that Ms Lynn was absent minded while writing this story: while retaining her usual skill she was not and could not move."
4,A Christian Reader's View,"What I found riveting was Mr. Pennino's ability to plot a plausible sequence of events, that would correlate to what is written in the Bible regarding the tribulation period. The book of Revelations is difficult to read and comprehend, but Mr. Pennino does a good job of relating God's Word to a scenario that is for the most part, realistic and interesting to read. I was disappointed that Mr. Pennino did not expound or speculate on the role that the United States would have during the tribulation. The ending reminded me of O. Henry, though I would have preferred a different ending. Nevertheless, the book is a very credible job for a first time author."
4,David Bowie's voice in the best song of Placebo,"Without you I'm nothing is the best song of Placebo.The single includes 4 versions of the song.From the first track (sinlge mix),which I think is the best, you can listen to that strange and gifted being called David Bowie. And I think that it is not accidental the fact that David Bowie participates in that emotional song.His voice gives to the song another dimension ,it becomes seductive and heartbreaking.The second track (unkle remix) gives more beat and rhythm.The third track (the flexirol mix) I can't say that I liked it althoug it is a little bit of a trip-hop version (which is one of my favorite styles).The fourth track (brothers in rhythm club mix) is a dynamite,a club version that you can't listen to it without dancing. If anyone of you has felt the emotion ""without you I'm nothing"" definitily must buy this single and you'll find out what I mean."
3,"Teens? Well, maybe.","The stories in this compilation are very juvenile. I would not suggest this book for anyone over the age of 15, and yet some of the subject material and swearing would not be suitable for children, either. This book suffers (in most cases) from the incongruity of decent stories and poor writing, lacking literary merit. While some of the language is passable, overall, I would not recomend this book to serious readers, unless you are just looking for some light pleasure reading. (Some very very light, not too terribly pleasurable pleasure reading.)"
4,The Year's Best Science Fiction and Fantasy for Teens: First Annual Collection (Year's Best Science Fiction & Fantasy for Teens),An excellent cross section of materials for the YA reader. I would recommend this to any instructor looking for a Reader that covers most of the pedagogy for YA literature.
5,Chillout Sessions - Vol. 4,"Great set for some smooth ambient music. The first disc is a lot more laid back than the second, but both are good. If you've heard the other chillout sessions (or are looking for a good intro), this is a great pick up."
1,Useless,"I ordered this book from Amazon and just finished reading it. The book has no useful value. It starts as a basic manual on Fundamental Analysis of companies, but quickly devolves into an unsystematic pile-up of various facts and opinions about investing, which have nothing to do with the topic of Fundamental Analysis. It is does not fit any specific level of the investment expertise. ""Useless"" pretty well sums it up."
3,I like the product and the soft light,"I like the product, and a great price. I ordered two packages. A bulb in one of the packages was broken. I can't return or get a refund unless I ship back the entire package. That's why the 3 stars. They aren't useful unless they aren't broken. The replacement pack was entirely broken. I wish it was packed better. I liked the convience of buying through Amazon"
4,Awesome Bulb!,I recently purchased the bulb and they arrived in perfect condition contrary to past reviews. I installed them immediately and absolutely LOVED the light. I would definitely buy these again!
5,Same Brightness,"Globe fluorescent spiral bulbs yield the same brightness as ordinary 100 watt bulbs. The light from these energy saving bulbs is nice and bright, and I like the fact that they last a lot longer than ordinary bulbs."
2,Could be better.,"These could have been better. I found that they don't fit into regular light sockets (such as those on wall sconces), and they noticeably flicker a bit. I think the GE ones are much better.I got mine shipped from Amazon, and half of them arrived broken as well."
3,OK. You get what you pay for,"These did not last me that long and are not as bright as the other brands available. I have several brands that have outlasted these by years.The other types you may want to look at are LED lights. They consume even less, but may not be sutable for all lighting."
1,Bulbs break in shipment,"Amazon packs the bulbs loosely in a medium sized box, so when they ship they break. Other than that, the ones that survive the trip to your door at least work."
2,"Worked well, but not very long -- less than a year","I ordered a pack of these -- they're okay. They worked, I had no problems at all with their brightness, but they didn't even last a year, and that's with far from 24-7 usage."
1,Bulbs were broken,Unfortunately I had to send back two boxes of bulbs because almost all of them were broken. They were packed very badly with plenty of room to slide around in the shipping box and very few air bags to prevent that from happening. This could possibly be a one time glich and the packing was done by someone new.
2,Misleading name,"These are physically much bigger than their 60W bretheren so don't know why they're ""mini compact"".""supersized monster"" bulb would have been more accurate.Works fine but sticks about an inch out of my vertical light fixture"
3,Satisfied Despite Some Broken Bulbs,"I ordered two 4-packs of these bulbs to replace a couple of 40 watt bulbs and a 60 watt bulb. By that comparison, the new light is HUGE and I am very satisfied with it. I don't know how well these would would work for actually replacing 100 watt bulbs. I was a bit disappointed that only six of the eight bulbs arrived in working condition."
3,Arrived in Pieces,This is the first item in over 100 that I have had to return from Amazon. I received a package of 4 and the 2 bulbs facing the outer sides of the package were broken. You could hear the glass rattling before opening the package.I've ordered a lot of small electronic gizmos and they tend to be packaged in air-filled plastic. These glass bulbs were sliding around in the package and only had a small piece of brown paper outside the OEM container which of course did not do the job of absorbing handling shock.I got a package of 8 Globe 13W bulbs (60W equivalent) and they work great and were securely packaged. These bulbs would have been great too if whomever packaged them had been a bit more careful with a fragile shipment.
2,No good for the environment,I would rather take the extra energy use than deal with the poisonous mercury in these bulbs. Most will be thrown away and make their way to our landfills where they will leak mercury into the ground. If enough of them end up there they could leak this mercury into underground water sources. Lets come up with another alternative to conventional bulbs.
1,Great Bulb If You Can Get It,"Like it's 60 Watt equivalent from the same manufacturer, the bulbs themselves are a great buy for the price. Unfortunately, just as others have noted, you may need some luck on your side to get these to arrive without being in pieces. The 4 bulbs get packaged in a carton and along the way, it is likely they smash into each other. I ordered 3 boxes and two of them were completely smashed on arrival. I had also ordered the 60 watt variant, but the packaging on those is the vacuum plastic type and those survived without problems. I would think twice about ordering these with the sole reason that they will likely arrive destroyed."
2,Buy them at a store,"I have no problem with the bulbs, but they were shipped loose in a box with some Fill-Air on top. Needless to say, many of them showed up in pieces. Broken glass was falling out of the boxes as I picked them up. Not good. I assumed they would be in clam shell packaging like the ones you would buy at Home Depot or Lowes, but that's not the case. It'd be easier to just go to Home Depot or Lowes and pick them up. That way you'll know they're intact when you get them."
1,3 burned out less than 1 year,"they burb out quickly at least when used in an upside down lamp, 3 burned out so far sylvanias keep going"
2,Don't buy these...,"These are inferior to the OEM filters. The photo displayed is totally inaccurate; they don't look like this. They have only about 1/3 as much folded filter surface as the OEMs and are encased in cardboard honeycomb frame that covers not just the edges but much of the surface. For just a little extra, you can get the real thing. Wish I hadn't wasted my money on these."
3,paper filter,Unfortunately this filter is almost an endangered species. The air filter that uses it works fine but the filters are hard to find anywhere. I now use a foam cut to size that can be rewashed over and over now. One gets only about four months out of one paper filter.
1,Did not fit,"I bought several of these, but they did not fit. I failed to notice the word ""Aftermarket"" in title, which apparently means that they are not really FAPF01/FAPF02 3M filters, but instead a filter made by someone else. They did not fit in my filters, and do not contain the same quality of filter materials as the original 3M Filters."
2,????????????????,I ordered black frames and brown frames where shipped!!!!!!! THE ITEM DESCRIPTION STATED BLACK FRAMES!!!!!!!!!!
2,Did nothing for me,I work with computers everyday. I really hoped that these glasses would help with the eyestrain.Been using them for three weeks and noticed no benefits.Too bad.
4,Computer Glasses A OK,"I bought these glasses after a trip to the eye doctor, where my vision scored perfect. I was still having eye fatigue (I am on the computer 8+ hours a day) and decided to give these a try. I used the glasses religiously for the first couple of days and didn't notice a huge difference; although I do think they helped. I would probably be apt to wear them more often, but I think they look pretty cheap."
2,works well but flimsy casing,"First off, I bought this particular pendrive cuz I thought it looked unique and pretty. What can I say, I'm shallow. But boy was I disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it was still cute. Just looks like a toy you'd give a five year-old. Cheap plastic casing with cartoon-like graphics. I've had it for about a month and the paint's already chipping off. The device is longer and thinner than normal pendrives, so I always feel like it might snap in half or something at the slightest provocation. And I don't find it to be any faster or more reliable than other regular ol' pendrives. So bottom line, you could probably get the same quality flash with better sturdier casing at a similar price elsewhere."
3,I like hole saws better,"I bought this to make 18 4"" holes to install AC HV duct outlets. Basically it is two spinning blades that grind away up more Sheetrock than a plain RIDGE brand (has small teeth) hole saw. Yes it has plastic tray to catch the dust but it make more dust than just the plain old hole saw. If you have an odd size hole to make than this product is OK, otherwise a regular hole saw with fine teeth seems to be better. I made one test hole with this and went out an bought a 4"" hole saw. There are light can hole saws if that is what you are looking for. The thick blades of this product scrapping the circle into the Sheetrock was not for me."
5,Great Movie,"I loved this movie. I have already watched it 3 times since September. I start Christmas a little early :)Romantic comedy, love Henry Winkler, and great little romantic tension in the story line."
5,The Most Wonderful Time Of Year,"Excellent movie!! My wife and I love Henry Winkler, loved the movie a year ago when it was on HallMark and glad that it came out in DVD??"
5,Just Perfect for the Christmas Season,"I just happened upon this during the holiday movie showings on Hallmark and just fell in love with it. It is, plain and simple, a nice story. My eight-year-old son enjoyed it as well, and didn't pick up on the child not believing in Santa, and in fact, though it hilarious when Morgan fell off the roof, and his ""fight"" scene with the toy store owner. Henry Winkler is outstanding as are the rest of the cast. A little gem."
2,DVD VS BLU-RAY format,"The BLU-RAY version of ""The Most Wonderful TIme of the Year"" is the 16:9 ratio. The drawback was that the movie, I think the term is called grainy, looked bad. The DVD version aspect ration 4:3 was far better looking but does not fill up the screen like a wide screen movie.. I don't know if the Blu-ray version can be adjusted somehow. All my other Blu-Ray movies are great so I'm not sure why it turned out this way. If anyone has any ideas I'd like to know what they are."
3,IT COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT,"The Most Wonderful Time of the Year-This movie sounded great, something I'd really like. And though the plot was good, the acting of the heroine ruined it for me. Not sure if it was the actress or just the way she performed her part. Either way, I was not impressed with her acting and it totally took away from the story. I got what her character was suppose represent but it was almost like she was a spoiled, snotty brat...with a smile on her face and in her voice. It just didn't it. It seemed forced and unnatural.On the other hand, the actor that played the hero was great. I liked his character and felt his acting was done well. Smooth, natural, a character you can fall in love with. Which is really too bad that one character/actress had to ruin it for the entire movie.Good thing I'd purchased this movie in a two pack, along with ""Moonlight & Mistletoe"" Now that's a movie I could watch over and over."
4,"Henry Winkler always is good, great moral value to this story.","Very entertaining, good example of how ""judgements from dress and first impressions"" can be so wrong, loved the moral of the story overall, and Henry Winkler so very good."
5,Sweet and Romantic,"Perfect movie for Christmas. Loved the movie when I saw it on TV, I love it more, now that it's mine. Love all of the actors and it had just the right amount of spice and humor. I can't get enough of Henry Winkler and his humor. I hope he is used it more movies, Warren Christie is simply too handsome and Booke Burns is gorgeous."
1,Never bad used dvds.,"Bad dvd had a new dvd player, the rating was listed as very good, not true, will not buy a used tape again."
4,Seasonal Great,Love Christmas stories and as technologies change this is a good movie to hav available to watch several times on our schedule.
5,GREAT MOVIE FOR ALL.,"I have always liked Henry Winkler. His portrayal of the ""Fonz"" in ""Happy Days"" has made him a favorite with me.He does a great job in this movie also. A great movie to watch around Christmas every year."
5,Great movie!,"Another one of my favorites,I watched this movie many times this season.Actors are very good I love happy endings and a little comedy made it better."
5,Perfect Family Movie!!,The Most Wonderful Time of the Year is about woman named Jennifer Cullen (Brooke Burns) who is a successful businesswoman and a single mother to her six year old son Brain (Connor Levins). Jennifer is a scroogette when it come to Christmas. Because of this Brain a six year old boy does not believe in Santa either. When Jennifer's favorite Uncle Ralph (Henry Winkler) comes to town to visit the family he brings a fellow passenger/new friend from his flight named Morgan Derby (Warren Christie) who is chef. Morgan stays with the family for a few days while he waits for his flight to Denver to take off because of being delayed because of bad weather. At first Jennifer can not wait for the day Morgan leaves her house. Morgan and Brain gets along really well. Morgan talks Brain into believing in something that kids should believe in. Something changes in Jennifer about Morgan. Watch this movie to see what happens to these characters in the end! YOU WILL BE SURPRISED WHAT HAPPENS!
5,Great Christmas Movie For Kids And Adults!,"One of my favorite modern Christmas movies. Henry Winkler, Brooke Burns & Warren Christie are really good. Great gift for anyone!"
5,Fun & Humorous Christmas Holiday Movie for the Whole Family!,"Another of my all-time comedy favorites for the Christmas/Holiday Season! Henry Winkler is a widower and retired law enforcement officer who is on his way to visit and stay with his niece for the holiday season. His niece is a single mom with a young son who is involved with a rich man who seems to be on the ""cold"" material side but successful and whom she feels is the right man for her. Meanwhile, Henry Winkler meets a handsome single man at the airport who he takes a liking to and whom is stranded at the airport due to a snow storm. Without asking first, he invites this young man to stay with him at his niece's home much to her disapproval. She feels this person is below her standards and can't wait for him to leave. As the story progresses she tends to finally realize that her boyfriend is a snob (along with his family) and finds the true meaning of Christmas along with the ""Right"" man of her dreams."
5,Henry Winkler is brilliant!,"I'm a huge fan of easy-going Christmas movies with a romantic twist, matching up people who were destined to know each other all along, despite previous match ups. And, quite frankly, The Most Wonderful Time of the Year is pure holiday gold! Henry Winkler is beyond adorable as a meddeling uncle, bringing about the unlikely romance that was certainly written in the stars.I highly recommend adding this DVD to your collection. The Most Wonderful Time of the Year is great to watch any time you need a romantic lift, and a lot of laughs!"
4,Great story,"Wonderful spin on how nice people can be during the holidays, kind of drags you into wanting to be helpful all year.Love Henry he's great and the story is special - great for all ages.A great holiday movie to add to your collection [if you have one]"
5,great,"Love this movie,love all the main characters,I thought it was a good story,I watch even when it isn't Christmes time."
5,Lovely Christmas Movie!,"We fell in love with this made for TV movie and recommend it for great family viewing! Enjoy the show ... it's a ""feel good"" movie for the holiday season."
1,THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR (Blu-ray),"This product was packaged well.This product didn't even work. It was stuck on play. I tried troubleshooting several times, it still didn't work.Very dissappointed.Will never order from this company again."
5,The Most Wonderful Time of the Year.,"Love this movie. I have watched it for several years on the Hallmark Channel and wanted it for my classic collection. Henry Winkler as Uncle Ralph, makes the movie funny and entertaining with his crusty wit and great match making ability."
5,"One of the most moving, rewarding books I have read","I am a psychotherapist who works with children so this book had particular interest for me. With that said, Mira writes about her unconventional, absolutely brilliantly creative approach to working with ""disturbed"" children in ways that will deeply touch anyone reading her book. She could care less about diagnostic labels and her work with each child is geared strictly to that child - and these are children that most practitioners and doctors considered untreatable. Mira is an extremely genuine, direct and honest person who treated these children with respect. An amazing book."
1,not so good,"I bought this and tried it on my winXP PC and the mouse would not work with IE to select items unless I would enable active X and I don't normaly surf with active x enabled. The problem with the mouse is major to me since I use my mouse a lot on the internet and otherwise. The logitech mouse I have would not work at all when I had this tablet installed and with the tablet mouse being basically useless for me I feel that this is a major flaw. I have a wide screen monitor and the tablet did not work well with it, it would not reach all areas of the screen and would default back to the side of the screen every time I lifted the pen. I can do better using my logitec mouse thatn with this so I sent it back for a refund."
3,Review,"I bought this tablet to use with Photoshop but found the pen too sensitive for my heavy hand. You don't need to actually touch the pad with the pen, you can just hover over a file and then tap it to open. This seems ideal for some but for me I found stresful for holding the pen since I seem to be constantly opening files by mistake. Then I began to use the mouse with the pad but the pad is so small I had trouble coordinating my movements to my 22"" screen. So this was the first product I ever returned to Amazon for a refund which they quickly processed in full. Thank you Amazon."
4,perfect size and useability,"Wacom Intuos3 4 x 6-Inch Wide Format Pen Tablet (PTZ431W)I think the tablet and pen are a perfect desk size, it's so much easier to be precise with a pen rather then a mouse. I think the mouse that comes with it is far better than previous versions but I still prefer the one button apple wireless mouse as far as usabilty goes."
3,Where's the software,"The product works great. However, there was no imaging software included (Adobe PhotoElements...etc). I could have missed that disclaimer though prior to ordering."
2,Too Small,My son wanted this as a birthday gift but it was just too small for an artist to use. It is a very nice set though and the delivery was perfect. I was refunded the purchase price almost immediately.
4,pen tablet,"The pen and tablet are excellent. They work perfectly with Photoshop.My complaint is with the mouse; it has a terrible feel, it's not smooth, meaning that it drags on the tablet surface. Wacom say's it will break-in;i've got a 100 hours on mine and it still hasn't broke in.I'm now using a separate wireless mouse."
3,Handy with Reservations,"It works as advertised. I purchased the product to cut areas out of photographs. I had no intent to draw with it.My problem with it is that one cannot control the ""speed/sensitivity"" of the cursor. If it could be slowed, it would be easier to outline and area in photoshop."
4,"Cool idea, but not as good as a mouse",I have tried using this many times and just can't fall in love with it. The pen starts to move the mouse before you even make contact with the tablet. This makes it hard to draw or pin point an exact place because the pen starts moving your cursor or crosshairs in Illustrator before you even make contact with the tablet. I find it hard to control and not very precise. I like it though and hope that I get better at using this product for as much as I paid for it.
4,Don't shy away from the small tablet,"I got this tablet b/c I was experiencing RSI. I'm an interactive designer, I was used to the larger tablets and I thought this one might be too small. NOT TRUE. This little guy is just as accurate on a large display as the bigger models. What's even better is that you don't ""move the pain to your shoulder"" which is common for the larger tablets."
4,"Excellent tablet, but Win 7-64 bit compatability issue unresolved","I've been very happy with the function of the tablet. Very responsive, and worth the expense. However, Win 7 won't load when I restart my computer with the tablet plugged in. The Wacom tech support crew has been politely flummoxed, and could only suggest I wait for a new driver release to resolve this previously unknown issue. In the process of my troubleshooting, I found numberous complaints from Win 7, 64-bit users about the drivers crashing or disappearing. So be prepared for the possibility.I'd still buy this tablet again, even with the inconvenience of unplugging before each restart.The mouse is slower and less accurate than my Logitech m215, but it still functions well and is comfortable."
4,Wacom Tablet Intuos,"The tablet itself works like a charm. It comes with a photoshop thing that is often uncooperative and prone freezing, though. You will need a lot of patience if you intend to use the photoshop attachment."
4,Great for Notebooks,"Got it for the graphics editing capabilities, but found that the pad with notebook make a great combo for travel or home use. No more working off desk tops that the mouse doesn't work on or just the touch pad to use. Makes working alot easier to use both or just one."
3,Betty Brings in Readers - Still,"This book is a good read if you want something fast with not a lot of details about the Broderick case. It does not compare with Bella Stumbo's ""Until the Twelfth of Never"", which should be top choice if you want a very thorough (but not in the least boring) read on it. The author gives a good representation of Betty's point of view, while at the same time stressing the total wrongness of her acts. With a double murder, high society, and the intriguing character of Betty Broderick you can't go too wrong picking this up. Can we ever get enough of this one?"
2,Overly biased toward Broderick and the defense,"After reading another book about this case and recently watching the Court TV rerun of the 1991 second trial, I was hoping for some additional insight (objective) into the background of Betty, Dan, and Linda Broderick. There was a little of that, but overall this was a disappointing book because of its strong bias toward the defense's theory of the case. Taubman apparently bought into the idea that the venom-spewing woman on the stand was ""emotionally abused"" by her ex-husband and his new wife to an extent that made murder expected and understandable. While she agrees that Betty Broderick deserved punishment, the author seems to think Broderick's actions made sense in the context of the bitter divorce. They didn't, they don't, and nothing I read in this book convinced me of this position."
3,"One of The Lighter Books,Another Quick Read","I feel like a professional as far as this case goes. LOL I have stated before that after seeing the totally pro Dan and Linda movie (The Betty Broderick Story) I started reading and watching everything about this case, including the court tv show, A&E Justice Story, MNCBS Headliners etc...While I will grant that Betty murdering them was over the top, some of the stunts of Dan and Linda were over the top too. You also have to keep in mind that Dan was the one whose ""friends"" were the lawyers and judges, not Betty. In spite of friends saying she could have gone to another county to find a lawyer, it really was not as easy as all that. The woman was completly blind-sided by this man she had worked so hard for. It truly was a sad, sad story.This book was quick, but did not have many details and certainly not reserched as the book by Bella Stumbo was. It was okay and added maybe a little more insight to the case but not much."
2,Betty,This book was ok but not near as good as until the twelfth of never. that book really gives you more of an inside look into the life of Dan and Betty Broderick. This book is a quick read if you are looking for a light read on the story and not a lot of details.
4,HD sheets,"The sheets were as described. My queen mattress is a bit oversized and they tend to slip off at times during the night but besides that , they are what I expected .Thanks"
1,Over rated,I returned this recliner because the bungi broke. I weigh 225 lbs and this XL recliner was rated for 350 lbs. If it's made in China don't buy it. I only had the recliner for 2 weeks when it failed.
2,Sturdy chair but crucial parts made of plastic??,"Just got my Faulkner chair yesterday and was so happy with how good it felt. Then I discovered that a crucial locking device to hold the position in place did not work at all. The part is made of cheap plastic! I closed the lock facing in, I tried closing it facing out. Nothing held the chair in place. Very annoying. I am not a big heavy fattie, I am a 5'5"" 108 lb 65 year old woman and it doesn't matter a bit. Why does the chair seem good overall yet with the key parts they are so poorly made? I just wrote an email to the company but based on other comments here I see the attention I get may be next to nil. I hope for the best."
4,Faulkner XL Recliner,The recliner arrived on time and in great condition. Another reviewer recommended that you buy an XL size and I am glad I did. My only negative comment is that it does not tilt back quite as far as I would like. It is well built and works fine. I bought it in black and it looks nice.
5,Wonderful chair,I have had this chair for about a month. I actually use it in my house. It is so comfortable and whenever I have company they fight to sit in this chair. It does fold up flat which makes it portable to take places too. You will love this chair!!!!
1,Does Not Perform as Rated - Falls Apart,"I purchased this 11 months ago at Amazon and it was very comfortable but did not hold up to ratings, I weigh ~ 270 and 1st the lacings for the cloth part of the seat started breaking, then the cloth itself tore. Such a shame."
3,Could have been better,"This chair is comfortable for a big person. My gripe is the locking mechanism. It simply sucks. It's not durable at all. I would lock it in position and if it wasn't fully reclined it would slide down regardless. I honestly would have returned this chair if my husband hadn't thrown the box away. I was hoping for more, but I'm settling for less."
4,Nice but not great,"These are nice chairs but not as long/tall as I had hoped. For someone 6 feet or under, they are fine. But I am 6'3"" and my ankles hit the crossbar at the foot. They seem nicely made and the black is very nice looking. The width is fine and they are comfortable (except as noted above). Clearly, they are overpriced for what they are, probably by $50. I bought them for a new TV room and they will be fine for that. I like the fact that the pillow can be used as a lumbar support which makes them more comfortable."
3,"It is what is says it is, but not what I was looking for","This is a low-production cost recording of the Rosary. There are teachings during some of the tracks that if you skip, you end up skipping some of the prayers. This may be nice for learning more about the Rosary, but not for listening to and praying day-in and day-out which is what I was after. I was looking for something I could listen to in the car on the way to work. There is not a lot of replay value due to this reason. Please note that in no way am I challenging the the content or the sincerity of Monsignor Champion. I just wish I had a better idea what I was getting before I bought this recording. Again without the intent of offending anyone, the Monsignor's voice was not equalized well either."
3,"kind of boring, actually","I really like Mirror, and especially Andrew Chalk, and good ambient in general, but this one was: quiet and long, with static and drone going on, broken occasionally (not very often) by nice bell chiming. Really went nowhere, not one of my favorites, although I hoped it would be. 40 minutes later, however....any one want to buy my copy?"
1,Unreliable and Unrepairable,"When it works it's quite a nice pump but it's very prone to overheating that not only shuts off the motor - good - but results in the flexible impeller vanes going through a self destruct routine in short order.Replacement impellers are very, very expensive for what they are.And even when they are replaced, the pump doesn't last very long - my pump quit working at all, some kind of internal motor failure after less than ten hours use.The design and construction makes repair impractical - even brush replacement is difficult, the design is so poor, so no matter what technical skills and patience you may possess, they will be of little avail applied to this product.It's not quite garbage level, although that's where mine is now, but if you want a unit you can rely on this pump should definitely be avoided."
4,Very good,"This is a rugged little pump. The garden hose connections were important to me as we are pumping the water from a rainwater collection system. I pumped through two 50 foot hoses and had pressure equal to that of the house, (we have our own well, so pressure is not equal to that of a city system, but is comparable to the 40-60# typical on a well). I was pleased to see that I could use sprayer nozzle and deadhead the pump with no problem. It's a little loud, but most universal motors are. Good build quality, good pressure, and spare parts in the box. It's worth the money."
4,Great little pump.,"The pump came nicely packed with suction hose and spare parts kit. Comparable price with others on the market. Stainless steel pump body. Worked flawlessly. Noted one minor problem - vinyl sleeve on handle slips off - either remove it of fasten with tape, etc. Pump actually dropped out of my hand while carrying it. Reported the problem to Wayne customer service. No satisfaction from initial call. Emailed the company and received a callback from a Supervisor who followed up on problem. Great service once I got past the Customer Service Rep.geosinner101@verizon.net"
4,Very useful pump,"I bought this pump to remove water from the winter cover of my swimming pool. It did the job fatanstically. The only problem is the water suction attachment is very easy to suck and sealed with my plastic swimming pool cover. I need to put a flat plastic plate (a dustpan) beneath the sucking head. Other than that, the pump is really what I need and very robustic."
1,Pump lasted 5 months,"We used this pump about 6 times over a five month period and now it is no longer working. We were very pleased with it when it was working, but certainly expected more use out of it."
2,"It's small, cute and good priced but...","It is certainly portable but it definitely can not pump 340 GPH for sure. I ran it for more than half hour it did not even pump 50 G. I have 200G rain tank filled with rain water, more than half hour later the water level did not even reduce 1/4 tank. Also the psi is not high enough to drive a ordinary garden sprinkler (swing type)."
2,Good for very small jobs,"Nice size, but pumps very slow and unsteady, wish i had bought a different one.Will not pump 340 GPH as stated."
4,"Simple and concise, yet effective text for basic sampling needs","I had the rare chance to attend a survey sampling short course conducted by the author of this book back in 2005. The book was given to course participants as course text, thus I had known the book since then. Whenever I have needed to design simple samples, I consulted the book finding it very useful to refresh my memory about the subject. Recently, after I must have lent the book to somebody I do not remember, I needed to consult it and I felt I could not accept not having it at hand, thus I bought it again! I would suggest it to either those who need to quickly and easily refresh their memory about the basics of survey sampling or to those who wish to become educated users of services provided by statisticians."
5,Must Read Church Planting Classic,"Next to the Bible, this book is the classic ""how to"" for church planting. Avoid the pitfalls of ""excess baggage"" and start churches even where money is tight! Using Brock's plan, our Baptist Association has started several churches in California that would have otherwise not gotten off the ground."
4,Hit the spot,"Scott Cohen wrote not only funny things, but things most of us have ran across or experienced in our lives. Recommended read for a chuckle or two...or three... :)"
5,"I Just Love ""Don't You Just Hate That""","Extremely entertaining read, the author's really hit the mark on so many of the daily trivial things that happen to all of us. There were so many lines in Mr. Cohen's book that gave me that ""eureka"" moment inside my brain. I highly recommend this book to anyone in search of a good laugh."
5,A great gift for yourself and your friends,This is a great little book that will amuse you whenever you have 5 or 10 minutes to spare or for even longer attention spans. I bought it when I saw the toilet paper roll on the cover and knew it would make the perfect bathroom book. Most of my friends who have used my bathroom have come out laughing and want a copy of this book. This book will have you thinking the following about each of life's annoyances:1. That is really funny2. What possessed this author to think of that.Get this book while you can. Good luck finding it. I already bought out the book store in my town so I can give copies to people that don't annoy me.
5,Clandestino,"Manu Chao's Clandestino was the biggest musical discovery for me in 1999. This CD is a musical journey full of surprises that will make you play it over and over again. It seems to me Clandestino came straight from Manu Chao's heart, mind and soul and that truly shows. The music paints very vivid pitcures and can not leave listener passive and uninterested. Intriguing and powerful, it is full of life and pleasent sounds, it is full of that special ""universal language"" that we so often forget, but crave in today's commercialized world. It will bring you up when you are down; it will cool you off when you need it; it will enrich you in every way music can do."
5,One of the greatest albums of all time.,"This is quite simply one of the best albums of all time. I have never met anyone who does not love this album. It is perfectly suited for every possible use. Party, car or home, it fits perfectly. It is so great that it has made me study Spanish so that I can understand it better. Simply a must-buy. The fact that it came out in 1998 and is still second-place on the French rock list says something of its quality. But do not buy it expecting to be immediately blown away by it. No, it is an album that grows on every listen. Every song is a classic. It is just absoloutley, stunningly, superbly, genuinely great. Just buy it now. You will not be disappointed. Guaranteed."
5,bienvenidos a tijuana!,"CLANDESTINO is one of the best albuns i've ever heard! totally pure and different from the usual stuff every artist plays - manu's got his own unique style, and yes, repeating rythms and lyrics during the whole cd. the fact is that we get into his mood, we feel we're elsewhere when we listen to this beauty. I highly recomend it to those who do not have limited heads! p.s.: and please, he does NOT sing in italian, but in brazilian PORTUGUESE, as one of the reviewers said... he's also FRENCH, and not mexican, as the same person wrote!"
5,Manu Chao- excellent,This album is most excellent. There are lovely sounds and the he sings well in every language. The variety of languages is also a plus. I recommend this album to anyone with taste and those who consider themselves part of the international community.
4,Para mi esposo,"A el le gusta mucho este grupo y esta produccion le gusto tambien, no lo escucha muy frecuente porque dice que es un poco triste, pero en general esta muy bien."
5,Unbelievable...Amazing...This is Music.,"Though I've been an Amazon customer since the beginning, i've never been compelled to write a review until now. This is simply one of the best CD's I've ever heard. I hope it generates a new genre here in the US. If you haven't listened to this CD yet, you have no idea what you're missing out on."
3,"Nice, although it gets tiring!!","I had previously given it 5 stars but, after 2 years I own it, 3 stars is the max I can give him.The record is good, all the songs are consistent, if slightly ripetitive. However, what brings it to a good level is one, single, hugely brilliant song. Yes, you can guess, it's Bongo bong, also known as king of bongo, in a much better version (on the Mano Negra record this song was completely different and much less interesting). That song, and the fllowing ""je ne t'aime plus"" are a masterpiece. However, the whole record is pretty good, although some songs are a bit too similar between them. I must say i did not quite like the mano negra records, but this is really much more mature and with a better inspiration, probably due to the fact that Manu Chao took quite a lot of time to produce it.All in all a decent record, maybe a bit overvalued now that I know it well."
4,Chido por clandestino,"Sin duda Mano Negra es uno de grupos que encierran un contexto verdaderamente profundo de la realidad y me parece que seria un excelente representante de la globalizacion que se esta viviendo. La fusion de culturas y formas de ver el mundo que estos muchachos encierran en su musica hacen que no pueda haber posibilidad de otro grupo igual. En cuanto el disco deManu Chao, llego en el momento exacto de mi vida. adem[as los destiempos que maneja y en general todos los ritmos son extraordinarios. Nadamas me resta comentar que aqui se espera pacientemente que se digne venir a tocar."
5,chapeau CHAO,"I was (and still am) a big fan of La Mano Negra (Chao's former band) and I can tell you with this solo album Manu Chao is at his best!!! Of course the style is much more intimate than that of Mano Negra but have you listened to this guitar melody on 'el desaparecido'?... simply fantastic! I've never been to Tijuana but I guess 'welcome to Tijuana' give us a pretty good picture of the city... Anyway... all the tracks are just great...buy this CD, you will not regret it"
5,Un disco kojonudo!,"Manu chao es, sin duda, uno de los musicos mas con mas talento de los años noventa. Primero con Mano Negra, y ahora en solitario, Manu nos obsequia con esta pieza de ""periodismo musical"", una reflexion clara, sobre la cruda realidad."
4,more great music by Manu Chao,"This is a great album that I recommend to anyone looking for Latin, punk, or ska. Most of the album consists of catchy and rhythmic music, but there are a few tracks that get a bit repetitive, hence the imperfect rating. I would suggest an album by La Mano Negra, Manu Chao's former band, before you look into his solo career. While his solo work had some amazing music, it was less inspired and less original. If you're strictly looking for Manu Chao, this is definitely the best of his solo work. Enjoy!"
5,An album that grows and grows and grows and.....,"Being a big fan of Mano Negra I was excited to hear that Manu Chao had a solo album out. Coming home with the cd I was ready for that high energy music that I was used to hear from him. I was surprised and a little disappointed to find that the entire album was pretty mellow. Now, 3 months later I love every second of it. The high energy is there, just in a different form. The way he has caught the sense of travelling and being somewhere away from home is chilling and fantastic. You can almost smell the new places. The songs are simple, but layered and dense so that there are always more to find. The beautiful harmonies. I agree with what I read somewhere: This is definitely a cd for the 21st century. Although it includes the entire world in the picture, not only the rich, western one."
5,Amazing!,"Manu Chao sings, speaks, and raps, while constantly switching languages... the rhythm keeps changing, too, taking the listener on a kind of journey to Manu Chao's world. The second track - ""King of the Bongo"" is worth the price alone."
5,a refreshing change from tired musical times...,"As you can see... it's gotten great reviews. believe them, it's true.maravilloso.there is such a blend of styles... of languages/idiomas... it reflects the way i feel times are... a blending of a world culture. it is good... and this is one of it's fruits.I had never heard of Manu Chao until last week when I visited some friends in Lyon, France. Within a minute the music had me intrigued. ...by the end of the album I knew I had found something I had been searching for... something refreshing.Español... Francais... English... sad at times... and yet, not unhappy. you'll enjoy it."
2,Very Average,"I really enjoyed his live album (Radio Bemba Sound System) and was hoping to enjoy the studio version of some of the songs off that album. Sad to say I couldn't even listen to the entire album. The recording quality was so poor it became annoying.I get the impression he is a great live act, but studio-wise it's difficult to emulate the same energy. Perhaps his later albums are better, but I'm afraid not game to risk any more purchases based on my experience with this album. I guess I'm just not that much of a fan."
5,Enchanting...,"It's like looking at a Monet, enjoying a piece of your favorite fruit in the beach at night, or backpacking through Latin America. Sorry for this explanation, but you just can't put in words the feelings and places this CD can take you to. It's definitely an experience, a compilation of melodies and flavors from different countries. Enjoy!"
3,From... Argentina,"The product took weeks to get here, but it got here fine... I wouldn't have ordered it if I knew beforehand that it ships from ARGENTINA! I will be indebted for the rest of my life with the greenhouse gases that it took to get here, but nothing wrong with the product. Location seller gives is misleading.TENGA CUIDADO - LOS PRODUCTOS SON DE ARGENTINA!!"
4,Easy listening,If you wanna relax after work with some cold drink or hot for that matter. Just put on this record and close your eyes.....
2,Not as good as I expected,"I ADORE anything related to Pekingese, so I bought this book with great anticipation. Unfortunately, it turned out to be vastly different from what I had expected. The writing style is not very coherent, there's not really a ""story"" - if you want to read the story, the description of the book on Amazon tells it all. And that's the only interesting part.The pictures are all in black and white, and the book itself was not bound very well.Even if you love dog stories, this one would be very hard to ""get into"". Sorry, but I simply cannot recommend this book for anyone but the most die-hard dog-story lovers."
4,good role model for all ages,i have a 6 year old daughter and she loves to listen to hilary duff even tries to act and look like her which i really don't mind because she has good self image and even in her musc videos she lets you know you don't need to bare all just to get noticed it takes alot of heart.2 thumbs up to you hil way to go.
3,Weatherstripping,It's pretty much like every other weatherstripping I've used in the past. I have no idea what an excellent for would look like
5,Excellent layout and approach to Transact SQL,"This book is fantastic! It's by far the best Transact SQL book I have ever read! It covers even the latest procedures and functions up to ASE 12.5.2 If you are working with Transact SQL, this book is an absolute must have!"
2,Looking for more,"I would characterize this book as 95% verbatim from the already existing Sybase ASE manuals, and 5% of a somewhat meandering, undetailed, and quite vague description of some important topics. Take for instance a 2 page ""chapter"" on sort buffers. Nothing there helps me to tune that part of the server. It's also full of some of the long known myths to performance, such as the 80% ""rule"" the optimizer uses to determine when to use an index. The chapter on fragmentation is also somewhat incoherent, and incomplete and includes algorithms for determining fragmentation that are not sound.All in all, I like that there is some movement in the ASE publishing ranks, but I was hoping for much more from this publication."
1,beware Tally/Genicom printer cartridges,"I'd never bought anything other than HP cartridges until I bought a cheaper Tally Genicom on Amazon. It worked okay for a while, but then a black bar began marring the pages. No matter how persistantly I cleaned the printer, the black bar persisted.There's a reason why this cartridge is cheaper than the HP."
3,Vampire vs. Silly plot devices....,"This is another film in the long line of ""Mr. Vampire"" Hong Kong horror & action films, however it wasn't quite as entertaining. In this film one-eyebrow-priest and his two bumbling disciples are raising a baby vampire (!) and struggling to discover the cause of poisoned river in their home town. Their quest is complicated by the arrival of a group of nuns and the ghost of a dead prostitute.While the plot synopsis might sound amusing, instead, I found it to be silly. Some gags were good...But they went too far with the 'baby vampire' whose slapstick gags, strange makeup and weird 'dolphin sounds' were annoying and strange rather than 'cute and endearing.'Ching-Ying Lam directs and stars in this lackluster sequel to this Classic Hong Kong comedy series."
4,Awesome that this even exists!,"I had no idea until today that this soundtrack even exists! While I have to admit that I *never* liked the modernized/recorded music from the 11th Hour (it reminds me of cheesy updates of classical songs) I do like much of the music from the 7th Guest (in fact, I was *just* thinking of setting up a DOS box and playing the game again) and will enjoy this album. Even though I have some midi hardware from the era (MT-32 and SC-55mkII, the latter is, I believe, what the music was composed for) and all of the midi files, this is still a treat. I often hum the tune that I now learn is called ""The Foyer"" quite regularly and it will be nice to have it at my fingertips when it bores its way into my ear!"
2,Disappointed,This is not a cardio workout. I bought this dvd hoping for a pilates cardio workout similar to Ellen Barrett's but without all the squats and lunges. I was disappointed. This workout is done at a faster pace than most pilates workouts but using my heart rate monitor my heart rate never reached even the low cardio rate.In my opinion this workout moves too quickly to allow you tofocus on good form and not quickly enough to be a cardio workout. The best I can say is you get a lot done in 30 minutes.
5,Philosophy,"This is a great collection of philosophical theory from Lao-Tzu to Alice Walker. I love that it has sections dedicated to feminism, war, death; it is broken up into easy to follow categories with easy to understand introductions. This makes it even nicer to compare readings and do what philosophy is meant to do...wonder."
2,nearly gets there,"I could only stand just over an hour of this series. More a love than an espionage story, it attempts to emulate the intricate world of disinformation but misses out. The plot is confused but my main gripe is the constant music in the background which changes with every scene - and they change often. To begin with I thought the constant 'music' (reminiscent of what might come across in an elevator) would go away as the introduction developed into the plot, which I could not follow as the background noises were so distracting. I reckoniIf you want to have a deep spy plot at least give the viewer the chance to follow it!So this is a confused product: it wants to appeal to the average viewer who does not want to think too much about what is going on, and the viewer who wants something more. I would guess the end product appeals to neither. They should go back to 'Tinker, tailor, soldier, spy' to see how it is done.Such a pity as I was looking forward to this one."
5,Keaton is GREAT,Michael Keaton steals the show in this great drama that is based on true events. I recommend this to anybody that is a fan of fact and fiction revolving around the cold war spy game. This is an excellent companion piece to The Good Sheperd and to any John Le Carre' books. Also if you have read the book Mole Hunt by David Wise you will like this movie. And if you haven't read it and have seen this movie check that book out. Alfred Molina is also very good. Very compelling and a superior drama for a made for TV mini series.
4,The Company,"it is a miniseries about the CIA (which is always called the ""company"") If one likes insider type intrigue. It has excellent actors and a very good story...as miniseries go...this is a really good one."
3,chris o'donnells hairpiece distracts,"Just finished watching last night; the mini-series was okay. I liked the Budapest street fights with tanks and the house to house. The Bay of Pigs deal was done pretty good. I also like the small training in Guatemala. However, most of these events were minimized and seemed choppy. Alfred Molina is great in all of his scenes, sure of himself and relxed. I didn't like the way Micheal Keaton subdued his character. Finally, Chris O'Donnells hairpiece kept distracting me in each of his scenes; in both decades. Is he really going bald in real life? That smirk of his was also annoying. Maybe if he would have grown a real mustache later in the series(not fake), his natural aging would have not been an issue. All in all, a good rental, but not for purchase. I got it free for accumulating Coke Reward points: 45 and you get a free Blockbuster movie rental. Since I drink a lot of coke I, it's just a bonus."
5,The Best CIA Movie Ever!!!!!!,"This movie is outstanding. The cast, the locations, direction, and story line come together and produce magic. Not too much action rather like ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"". A thinking man's spy movie. Let's face facts, most movies now are all computer generated massive special effects with little or no substance. Some people will not like this movie because it makes you think. I for one, have not given up this process and enjoy movies that encourage one to take a hard look at ourselves."
4,Interesting & Well Acted,"I Enjoyed This Mini-Series, Even Though It Was A Bit Slow To Start, The Acting Was Superb By The Entire Cast, I Recommend It To All Amazonian's"
5,The Cold War Company,"It looked original in the package as advertised. My wife and I haven't watched it yet but have fond memories of an excellent TV production. Mr. Angleton was right about the mole. However, the mole was in the FBI and elsewhere."
4,"great drama, great ""mole"" twist","Though I have not yet read the book, I do intend to after seeing this mini-series. I agree with some other customer reviewers that many significant events in the time period covered are omitted or glossed over, esp. the assassination of JFK a year after the Bay of Pigs, but the overall tone and mood of the mini-series is realism. I kept gagging everytime I saw Michael Keaton as Angleton puffing away at his cigarettes. The suspense of detecting the mole, and the twist when the mole's identity is revealed, was well-done. It was hard to believe, however, that Chris O'Donnell as McAuliffe and the English woman he befriended in Hungary could heal so completely and relatively blemish-free after the brutal torture and beating they sustained at the hands of the Hungarian secret police. All in all, it's a drama worth watching, and the activities of Yvgeny as a runner for the CIA mole has relevance in today's post-9/11 world."
4,Impressive...very impressive.,"I didn't roll into this one with high expectations, even though I love all three of the major actors.There are three parts to this, and while the first one is a bit slow, the 2nd and 3rd are terrific.Keaton is a bit annoying at first, but really comes into his own in later episodes. Any of the three show why they are excellent ACTORS.Great pic (on Blu Ray), first rate production. A lot of care went into this, with having to age the actors across 3 decades. You won't be disappointed."
2,The Company,"Dear Amazon Review:)The DVD ""The Company"" is a good spy/espionage movie with a good story. However, the movie is very slow and drags on making it a little boring. I am surprised due to the quality of actors in the moview, but it all depends on the way the script is written.A bit to slow for my taste is the bottom line.Sincerely,Mario F. CeballosConcord, CA."
4,Good reference. already out of date . . .,"this is a great reference, and the portion on custom functions is great for someone learning more about this wonderful feature of filemaker. the text has a few typos which will have you scratching your head while trying to make your functions work. be careful - some functions are mis-named in the bubblesort section. otherwise this is a great book, but if you have a copy of ""Special Edition: using Filemaker"", then you don't need this book. just check on Cleveland Consulting and Brian Dunning's websites for your custom function fun."
5,Good USB 1.1 extender,"EDIT: Now I using this USB extender for 1 year, and it is working is should. I'm using it with a 15 m length CAT5 cable, with an USB Infra reveiver, sometimes I use it with an USB 1.1 Soundcard, both working without any issues. Excellent little gadget, works nicely!"
5,does what it's supposed to do,"This product comes out of the box needing minimal assembly, I know previous reviewer have had problems with some quality issues but I haven't had any problems myself. Does what it's supposed to do, is well built and sturdy. Jack stands are well made and have a good feel to them - the build on everything feels solid.Only issue is clearance...It's a jack that probably is best for trucks, SUV's and full size sedans - your going to need at least 6-7"" of clearance to get this jack under your car. I solved that issue with getting a ramp then jacking it up the rest of the way. An extra step that wouldn't be necessary with a lower profile jack."
4,A great collection of Bad Brains material,"This collection spans the best of the career of these DC/NYC reggae/hardcore musicans. Later stuff is OK....but Bad Brains aren't the same without HR's ""throat"".If you have never heard the band before this makes a good primer, to get you into them (and they are counted as influences by lots of bands: Beastie Boys to Living Colour & No Doubt (the last two have covered Bad Brains songs both live and in the studio). So if you like what you hear on this disc....make the purchases to get yourself the rest of their library (especially the early stuff) !My only complaint with this compilation would be that I prefer the SST label recordings versions of the ""I Against I"" era material. I am sure not having them on here is more a result of label infighting, so at least recordings from that era are still here for inclusion.Other than that.....great, great stuff !!!"
1,NOBODY'S ANGEL WON'T LAST LONG!,"NOBODY'S ANGEL, IF YOUR READING THIS GET A LIFE AND STOP TRYING TO ACT LIKE YOUR'RE SO FAMOUS. YOUR'RE NEVER GOING TO SO GIVE IT UP. YOUR MUSIC IS VERY POINTLESS AND UNORIGINAL. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT WASTING YOUR MONEY ON THIS! ZERO STARS"
3,"Pretty Good Light-Hearted Pop, Definitly Spicy",If you like the Spice Girls--or have little children who do--you really need to give this a listening to. This is a deadringer for them. Their hit single: If You Wanna Dance has got a hook that will make you wanna do just that and some catchy lyrics to go along with it.
3,somwhere between good and mediocre,"This album wasn't too bad. Nobody's Angel is just another all-girl group that is hardly distinguishable from such acts as the Spice Girls and TLC, but they make their mark with this album that contains such fun songs as If you Wanna Dance and We Are Family. As long as you don't take it too seriously and think of how fun it is, you might actually enjoy this album"
1,NOBODYS ANGEL WON'T BE GOING TO HEAVEN ANYTIME SOON.,"This album is another formulated girl band with formulated pop songs that are produced from the same old cookie cutter pop music factory.None of these songs are original....Can we please have Deborah (Debbie) Gibson show them how to write true candy pop. Her ""Out of the Blue"" debut was a refreshing turn in teen pop candy, showing that a 16 year old can write and produce some good cotton candy pop.These girls just flash their physical beauty around, trying to sing with the end result no talent.Songs that are at their worst are ""Next Stop Heaven""; ""Cherry Crush"", and the worst rendition of a 70s disco classic- Sister Sledges ""We Are Family""....they retitled it ""We Are Family"" (Angels Style)....and it has their style written all over it. JUNK!!!!!!This album has only two good uses: 1. The jewel box can be used for one of your better CDs and 2. The inside jacket can be used for underneath your pet birds cage."
2,"okay, a little too like the spice girls",These girls are okay but I mean total spice girls wanna be's. I think they were okay in model behavior but just look at the cover of their cd they even look like the spice girls!
1,Boring and Stupid!!!!,"I bought this CD thinking that it would be good. I was SOO wrong. Don't get me wrong, I likegood pop music, but this is NOT good music. Every single song on here sounds the same. If you buy this, you will be sorry!!!!!!!!!"
2,"well, at least they were truthful in stating what they were.","They were truthful, they are -Nobody's- Angel ... the problem with this CD is I think I may have lost a few IQ points listening to it. I can't knock it completely, they almost had a song with ""Keep Me Away"" ... almost... but it's not, because ... well ... the truth? Their voices bite the big one. I'm ok with Britney, I'm okay with Mel C., and I'm ok with B*Witched, or at least I was when I was twelve... but these voices could make a grown man scream, an apocolypse happen, or a pair of poor worn out bought in 1995 speakers to explode.I wouldn't suggest that you buy this CD ... unless you'd like something to make fun of. But I warn you, even with those noble purposes, you might ralph up those poptarts you had this morning on the case..."
5,Forget the old music,I think the album is excellent. There are so many different beats and types of songs. The girls were brave also to get out their on their own and accomplish so much so fast. Their songs appeal to many people and their tunes are very catchy. The CD is excellent. I think these girls will be around for awhile!
2,Uggghhhhh,I saw Nobody's Angel preforming at a mall and they were totally lip-syncing to there music. They were too much into their dancing to actually sing a few songs. N-E-Ways I dont like this album and these girls wont last long.
5,great cd,"My mom got me this cd for me cause she knew one of their songs. When I got it, i was a little skepical, but i threw it in and next thing i knew i was tappin my foot to the beat all the way through the cd. All the songs have great beats, great vocals, not a song on it i don't like. Alot of dance with a few ballads. These girls can sing. Not to mention they seem like they have a good level heads. Hopefully their around for awhile."
1,Gah...,"I just dug this out of my CD collection, remembering that I used to like it.I now think it is quite possibly the worse CD I own. The songs all sound the same. How much 'fun' pop can one poor soul take? You know how Creed has made 3 CDs now, and they pretty much all sound alike? That's sort of how this is. I'd be surprised if Nobody's Angel had the money left over to make another album. Anyone who gets their big break on a TV show directed for children just can't be wonderful, I guess."
4,fun 2 dance 2,"First, I'd like to make a comment to trlchick. You said that nobody's angel won't be around as long as britney spears, n sync, or christina aguilera who have ""real"" music. May I just say that although I am somewhat a fan of all three, I wouldn't consider their music ""real"". If you want a taste of ""real"" music, listen to bands like third eye blind, sugar ray, or goo goo dolls. Still, this cd is a great cd to bring to a dance party and just listen to for the fun of it.P.S. My favorite track is ""Can't Help Myself"" but all of them are cool, and another comment to trlchick, don't say that nobody's angel doesn't have ""real"" music, because I don't really think you know the definition of ""real"" music"
5,Pretty Good!,"I don't own this cd, but I heard it on Disney Channel (and on Samples). I just can't help myself is the best song on there, i think. I like other people better, though. ( Eiffel 65; THEY ROCK; BLUE IS THE BEST SONG EVER! , Christina A., BSB, N'Sync, Britney Spears, etc.)"
1,Didn't work for me,Saw this on Dr. Oz tried it and it doesn't work for me still having a hard time getting my sleep.
5,Well worth the wait!,"For all you David Lanz fans who have not purchased this CD, shame on you! For all of you who aren't David Lanz fans, you will be after hearing this phenomenal recording. I didn't think any CD could even come close to my personal favorite ""Skyline Firedance"", but this one is truly a work of art. The only thing better was meeting him in person, and seeing him live on stage. He has a style all his own and his music is inspiring."
2,This one hurts,"A long awaited CD by David Lanz and what a disappointment. I have them all and this one does not soar like his piano solos, but is muddy with orchestral pomp. Too much like some of those lesser new age piano stars out there. Let's hope he goes back to the cleaner, finer sound that he does so well."
4,Moon is Stellar,"David Lanz is back in fine form with this first recording apart from the Narada label. We are treated to some of his finest work yet in the first two tracks ""The Green Man"" and ""Dancing with Dionysos"", both of which are brimming with joyous energy. ""Chasing Aphrodite"" seems a little misnamed, as this lovely waltz sounds like anything but a chase. The title track is a wonderfully mysterious piece. Unfortunately, after such a fantastic start, the rest of the album seems a bit of a letdown. Not to say that they're bad, just that they don't form the same kind of emotional connection that the first four tracks do. I was excited to see the ""World at Peace"" suite with orchestra, but to be honest, I think he did it better with his earlier ""Skyline Firedance"". I will admit that the gentle rocking sounds of ""The Visitor"" create a wonderful sense of peace to close out the CD.All in all, with its variety of moods and instrumentation, this is a highly enjoyable listen."
1,Another disappointing release,"This is not the David Lanz that Narada Lotus fans came to love and know. If you enjoyed the simple beauty of Cristofori's Dream, Heartsounds, Nightfall and Return to the Heart, this new CD by Lanz is a disappointment. Lanz's once intimate, sparkling and introspective piano is now lost to the pop and orchestral themes he has pursued on this release. The drums and rhythm section add to the misery of this album, failing to bring life to what are mostly unexciting piano pieces. Save your money, and instead check out ""From the Heart"" - the last great release from this new age pioneer."
3,"Good Music, but the artist talks too much","The music on this CD IS very relaxing and has fun sound to it. But the artist ruins it by expressing his views on mythology and goes on and on about ""world peace"". That's fine for him, but I don't want to listen to his speeches, I just want the music! Other than that, this CD has beautiful music on it, my particular favorite is 'East of the Moon'. As good as the music is, I don't think I will be buying much music by this artist anymore."
