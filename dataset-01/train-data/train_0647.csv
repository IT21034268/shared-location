3,Preachy,This is a good book but the ending isn't done well.He preaches the virtues of good and justice to the villain when he should be running for his life.This preaching goes on far too long.
4,Good stuff!,"This book gives another vision of what being Tibetan really is. Many adhere to a stereotype of what it is, the vision of a lonely monk in a cave comes to mind when Tibet is brought up. This book allows for an alternative view to emerge and to flesh out a real and honest depiction of the people. They are afflicted with the same pains and delusions but have a unique way of coping with them. This story shows these attributes in fantastical characters that will delight any lover of mystic places but also creates allows them to be believable and relatable. Good stuff."
2,Missing vital information.,"The information given in this book is okay, but it is the information that is missing that concerns me. There is only one brief chapter on handling emergencies and it is sadly lacking. There is no mention of what to do in case of severe weather that occurs suddenly, a persistent stranger on the phone or is at the door, a child that is choking or gets burned, or any of a million more things that could happen. Future editions should add some of this practical information as well as include a checklist of things a babysitter should know such as the location of a flashlight, first aid kit, breaker box etc. Although it lacks the Christian emphasis, I think that ""The Babysitter's Handbook"" published by Kidbacks better prepares teens to cope with the realities of babysitting."
4,Unique arangement,"It is interesting when you hear ""Dancing Queen"" or ""Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!"" played with piano and orchestra. Creative and unique."
5,An excellent performance by Wendell Harris !!!,"Although alittle dark at times, this true story is extremely funny and thought-provoking. Once you realize that Doug Street actually did ALL of these things (farces), it becomes a more remarkable story. Harris' performance as the ""psychotic"" Street is one that viewers will never forget. Both his intensity (and drastic mood swings) and expansive vocabulary were accurate depictions of the real-life Street. This is one of the unheralded gems!!"
3,"Good material, but needs a good Editor","The material in this book and in the 70-296 Study Guide is very good and complete. However, the number typos, punctuation errors, references to missing or incorrect figures, and just plain wrong answers to some practice questions -- is all very distracting. It would appear that the final edit of this book was skipped in order to get it out on schedule. Unfortunate. Make sure you have plenty of hands-on experience before taking this exam, esp. if this is your only source of study material."
1,DO NOT COUNT ON THIS BOOK FOR PASSING THE EXAM,"This book is good to become more knowledgeable on all topics, but the material certainly doesn't match even the style of questions on the exam.Doesn't go into enough detail on the subjects."
2,"70-292 has changed, and this book won't help","Just took 70-292 today. The exam has changed considerably since this book was written. According to sources on MCSA/MCSE forums, the exam has been rewritten as of December 2004. While it covers the same objectives, the focus is very different. No book written before December 2004 will prepare you enough for this exam.Be prepared to write off your exam costs the first time you take it, as you'll probably be sitting for a retake."
1,"Poor quality, not a serious preparation for exam","First of all, this book has plenty of mistakes among the self test questions. None of these questions or similar questions are asked at the exam and the dvd is useless, showing a trainer reading down the main lines of the chapters.It was the first time I bought a Syngress book and the first time I did not pass a Microsoft exam. I'll go back to Microsoft Press."
2,"Good Reference, but not enough","This book offers great reference material for the field, but the details needed to pass the exam are not to be found here. Don't use it as your only source for the exam."
5,Great,Hatch Centurion's knee-pads are supremely comfortable. They come at a reasonable price and are promptly delivered in perfect condition. Can't say anything bad about these babies.
3,Might work in some cases.,"Edra D. Blixseth shares her story with the intent to help other battered women regain the strength to leave. I mistook the book to be an indepth look at her life in a battering relationship. However, I was delighted that her story has a happy ending. It offers hope for the future without being unrealistic. The advice given for escape was meant for a financially secure woman who has at least a little control over what she does with her money. Usually, the battering partner takes control of all financial resources to secure his/her power."
4,wrong hinge,The hinge was fully functional and what I ordered. Unfortunately I ordered the incorrect hinge based on the ordering process and my ignorance on hinge specs...
3,Dry but of Substance,"This book is one of the driest book in computer science that I read. It may take a little bit more effort to read than other computer science book, but the topic and its explanation are not incomprehensible. If you are willing to put time and effort, you will gain quite a lot of information out of it.It is true that this is not UP TO DATE and some information have been outdated and needs revision. However, many of these topics are fundamentals of different languages that most of these explanations and theory are very much applicable today as they were a decade or so ago.What many students are forgetting is that this is a concepts book. Many arrivals in the technology are going to come and go, but the important thing is the ability to draw on from the knowledge you have and make analysis, comparison, and contrast. This is a very good way to mature in and gain a better understanding of subject materials."
1,"Terrible, absolutely terrible","I had to use this for a class and boy was I dissapointed. This book relies more on words than examples. Each sentance feels like a mouthful, packed with words that each refer to a concept in programming. Subsequently, you either have to read extremely slow, or read the paragraph over and over before you understand what the author is trying to say. Extremely unclear and frustrating. Avoid this book."
3,"a good book, but...","I have translated this book to Chinese, in my opinion,this edition is worse than the previous one.Some references are not OK,they are linked to the page in the 3rd edition :)."
3,Average Universe,"Not as good as earlier seasons. The ""Ask The Universe"" feature that crops up in the middle of each episode in Seasons 4 and 5 is a bit annoying and not always relevent to the show's topic. Episodes in this season are also rather repetitious with one another and with those of prevous seasons; adding relatively little new information. Recaps after commercial breaks are too long; as if assuming the TV audience has virtually no long-term memory of what was said before the commercial - especially annoying in a cmmercial-free DVD. One's Universe DVD collection is essentialy complete with the first three seasons. Overall, I found Seasons 4 and 5 to be okay but somewhat disappointing compared toearlier seasons.The Universe: The Complete Season Four"
2,Not actually a BLU RAY,"I was sent the standard DVD set instead of the bluray which was advertised.I'd like to see the blu ray, but I'm a little unsure of ordering another on the off chance that I get the standard dvd again. Did anyone actually receive the bluray?"
4,Well Worth It,"This little drum machine is quite worth the money spent. I wanted something with midi, live audio, and foot pedals and this unit more the covers the bases.I was actually experimenting with playing the drums while playing guitar and not only do the foot pedals lend themselves to that purpose, but the pads themselves can be played the feet when the drumset is set to ""handperc"". It is awkward to do, but it would actually work.The ""live audio"" sound quality is just fine, and plenty of volume for at least acoustical instruments, which is what we were doing. I have used the Midi out to drive sequencing software which works fine. Assigning sounds to pads also works well using the thumbwheel.The only shortcomings I have observed is that it should come with a power supply, rather than having to buy one separately, and it would be nice if you could save a few custom kit setups, rather than just the one ""CU"" that is built in.All in all, I am very pleased with the purchase."
3,Missing something?,"Works, is in good condition, and shipped promptly. But did not include 2 Two Assignable Foot Pedals as advertised. A crucial part of the kit. It's almost useless without the pedals. Had to quickly come up with a new, expensive solution. Came with batteries, which was good--was hoping for an adapter but it wasn't necessarily advertised as coming with that I suppose."
5,Beverly's Lewis' the Shunning,Heart warming story of the strength and courage of a young girl trying to find her idienty and yet keep her faith.
5,wonderful adaptation of the book!,"This book was a wonderful adaptation of the book and I am eagerly awaiting the other two movies. The acting was perfect, I'm so glad I watched it!"
3,Was expecting better...,"I want to preface this review by stating that I haven't read the book it is based on. It's a sweet story, but I really hope the reason it ends so abruptly is because there will be a sequel? The end was anti-climactic and disappointing.I agree with the other reviewer in that the Amish women wearing makeup was laughable, and also it was very unrealistic when Katie came out of the clothing store with her hair completely straight after it had been up in a bun under her prayer cap.Most of all, I was disappointed that when Katie was calling out to God for help and guidance that her dead boyfriend showed up instead. I was really hoping there would be more of a truly biblical faith element to this movie.Entertaining enough, but left something to be desired in my opinion."
3,Disappointing Compared to the Book,"This is the first time I have seen this author's work on film. I would have been happier if I could have just rented the movie and not purchased it. They didn't give you that option. As usual it didn't live up to the book. However, living so close to Lancaster County I can say the scenery and background looked pretty well researched, based on the fact I have been inside a real Amish home, met them and once had dinner at the home of an Amish woman."
2,Shunning,"Great general idea for a story, but the movie was undeveloped. I suppose it would work better as a mini-series or edit out a lot of dead space and make one movie out of the series. I kept waiting to get beyond the introduction and it never happened. Very dissappointing. Also, I am not an expert on PA Dutch accents, but I would be surprised if they were accurate."
5,Amazing Love of Mothers,"One thing you can see through this movie is the love of two women for the same daughter. The Mother was able to give her daughter to an Amish woman to raise and thus gave that women a gift she would have never known otherwise. Then when the natural Mother needed to just see her daughter after years, the Amish Mother gave her the gift of meeting her daughter.It took two strong women to do what they did.A Mother's heart is strongly portrayed in this movie.Then when the father cannot stand to shun his daughter anymore, it brings tears to your eyes. That is a true story of the love of family."
2,Ending makes this movie not worth watching,"I must agree with MS. M. Angell. I was all into the movie until the end. Then it blindsides the viewer with an abrupt ending. The ending is so sudden it takes the viewer completely unaware. It leaves the viewer to guess what happened for the rest of the story. It was a classic end to a movie that plans on producing a sequel but, to my knowledge, there is none. I was also surprised that Michael Landon Jr. was associated with this film given the poor ending. He normally makes VERY good family movies. Don't get me wrong the movie had a very good plot, acting, etc., however, the ending is such a disappointment ,in my opinion, it is not worth the time to watch."
3,The Shunning,"I liked the acting, enjoyed learning more of the Amish community, beliefs and ways. I have always admired, and enjoyed learning about Amish. The scenery was amazing and from the little I know, incredibly real. The acting was great! Did not like the ending."
3,A few director's mistakes - close to the book though,"It is obvious Beverly Lewis did not participate in this movie after selling her rights. Because she would have told the director that an Amish woman does not wear make up (the main actress, very pretty, wears a ton of make up when on the farm and about); she would have told them that married Amish couples don't wear wedding rings....also the main actress gets flat-ironed hair after buying Englisher clothes and undoing her bun and removing her Kapp? Does not happen in real life.I thought the daed and the mamm (in Pennsylvania Dutch :) were amazing actors! The main actress, too but she needs to love more like a ""natural"" Amish girl...ditch the make up (at least when you play the Amish part).For those criticizing the end, don't be sad, this is a 3-part story :) So this is how the first book, The Shunning, ends :)All in all a good movie but lacking something more Amish...can't define it really....but I am sure the next director can nail it down."
3,Beverly Lewis' The Shunning,"I enjoyed the movie- I learned about the Amish. It was interesting to see how they live. I did not, however, like the ending. It was too abrupt. There wasn't any closure."
4,Good,I generally enjoyed the film. I guess my strongest concern was not enough closure at the end of the film. You are left asking questions that were not answered.
5,Book to movie,"This sticks to the book real well. There are 3 books in that series. I hope movies are made of them too. You are kind of left hanging, which is just how the book leaves you:-)Very good."
5,Very good video,"Really enjoyed watching The Shunning. Very well done, and seemed to stick quite close to the original book. Sorry when it ended, and am hoping they are doing the other books, to continue the story. This video is well worth buying"
2,You Get What You Pay For,"Is the deal too good to be true? Once again this old adage is proven accurate. I saved 100 bucks off the cost of tapes from a 'regular' vendor and thought I had a great deal. What I didn't know is these tapes are used. I do not believe I ordered used, but that's what I got. The tapes do not have the plastic cases if that matters to you.They came wrapped in cellophane in a small box. Delivery was on-time or even fast than expected. Time will tell how long they last or whether we start having write/read errors.Caveat emptor, as always. *sigh*"
1,What the heck is this!?!,"The Very Best of Pure R&B;: The Summer CollectionI was led here because I was looking at ""The Very Best of Pure R&B;"" import CD and it had a link to where you can download the songs as mp3s. But this doesn't seem to be the same album. Maybe you people over at Amazon can fix this."
3,Pretty Good set,"though this Compilation isn't all R&B it's a Combination of R&B&also Hip-Hop Acts in the Collection.you got Toni Braxton,Blackstreet along with cuts by 2Pac&Outkast.it's a Pretty Good Mix of Cuts that are catchy."
4,Upsetting and important,"This book made me think about female curcumcision in detail which I had avoided thinking of previously! It also brought to mind other practices that have taken place here in the U.S., such as routine episiotomies after childbirth (to be tight for the husband), and giving formula to ALL new mothers. I highly recommend this as a book club selection if you can handle the topic!"
4,I couldn't place it down.,The feeling you get when you read this book is one in a million. It touches your heart. A young girl who lived in Africa and moves to America after getting mutilated to fit her custom. She had to learn how to adapt and live with what was done to her. THis book was definetely one of her best.
3,Well Done,"Alice Walker interestingly leads the reader through an exploration of a difficult topic. A bit difficult to begin, but cultural differences were overcome by her integration of all the participant's views. Could have been a bit longer to more fully develop some of the ideas presented, but succinct works well, too."
2,too long to ship,"I needed this book for a class discussion in about 3 weeks, they said I woould get it in about a week, it actually took 2 weeks to get it and by then I went ahead and bought it somewhere else."
5,An absolutely incredible view on African traditions,"I think that Alice Walker in this book gives a great and quite detailed view on this real bad African tradition that, badly enough is still practized in alot of African countries. It is amazing who she, as an African-American woman describes with such an intensity the pain that these women go through. It is another interesting example of how people do anything to just not go against the crowd just because of fear of being eliminated. I think it is good to know that there are women who fight against initiation because it is one of the worst evils that can be done to a female. I understand that Tashi says she is guilty of having killed that woman because that is the only way she can escape all the pain that her life has brought. This book is one of the best books I have ever read because it deals with a subject that many people deny is existing in a very realistic, but also exciting way. You just can't get enough of it once you have started reading."
1,Let's get real.,"This novel presents a great deal of false and misleading information about the origins, motivations, and practice of female genital mutilation AKA female circumcision.I suggest that anyone interested in anything beyond a quick cheap frisson of eroticism and horror to conduct some research into the many objective sources on the topic."
5,"What can anybody say about Alice, she is fabulous!!!","I can't think of the words to describe Alice Walker other than she has been given the innate ability to develop characters that we know, we love, and we envy. Her books always give me a more hightened awareness of who I am as well as how blessed I am. She makes her readers feel the pain of her characters, as well as realize the pain that we deal with in our everyday lives and how it affects the people we know and love. Alice Walker's character Tashi comes to her self awareness only after she has hit rock bottom. Walker brings to life the historical oppression, lies, and deception that has ruined the lives of so many helpless women throughout the world. This book gets two thumbs up, and I can't wait to read Walker's next work!!!"
2,Depressing and Confusing,"Most people will likely call this a great piece of literature, but it wasn't that great for me. I found it confusing and depressing. There were moments when I understood what was happening, and then moments where I found myself saying, ""I just don't get this."" Then there were the passages that were so graphic that I really wanted to put the book down, but I trudged along. It was just too deep for me. Not to take anything away from the author, but I did not like this book."
4,Not as good as 7 + 8,"Has lots of T&A but no faces to add to the pervertedness. Still it's good to see real women showing T&A. Fat latins, Dark Latins, Old Latins, Young Latins, Light latins. I mean real latinas not some J-Lo or Silicone Barbies. Real T&A for real perverts!!!!!! But not much, like the others Vol 1-7, to really get you off!!!!!!!!!"
4,Sturdy and Portable,"It took some hunting, but I finally found a step stool that is sturdy enough for big people! It's not so heavy to move and folds together so it doesn't take up too much room. The handrail gives you a better feeling of stability while on it, too. :)"
4,A collector of these toys,The McFarlane toys are more of a collectors item than an actual toy. The items are excellent.
5,Does morality keep us from seeing the world as it truly is?,"I unwantingly began reading this play as a class assignment and by page 3 I was captivated. I couldn't put it down. It made me think about morality and question my own ethics. Aunt Dan helped me understand the concept of ideology, knowing my ""role"" in society and how morality and ethics shields each of us from seeing ourselves, really seeing who we are. I look forward to reading it again..."
1,"Yeah, It Sucks","I got this at my local cd store. I knew it didn't have Bruce Dickenson on it. I thought, 'what the hell, it was only $9 and there has to be some good stuff on this'. Some of the riffs, song ideas are OK. Disc 2 has better songs and vocals I guess. The vocalists on this compilation just couldn't seem to pull the songs through, even Paul himself. Its too bad, cuz he's a good guitarist for this genre, despite a track on Disc 1 that has a lead intro that ends on a note bent way out of tune. The songwriting on this compilation is hit or miss between the two discs. The tracks in the middle of Disc 1 are horrible, as in if Peter Griffin were dashing through an 80's montage on Family Guy.Anyways, on my quest to find the uncharted or under-appreciated bands of the nwobhm era, or check out what happened to bands after whomever joined whomever-more-famous, I shouldn't have paid so much. If you are looking to get this for your collection sheerly for historical reasons, get the one for $1.50."
1,WHERE'S BRUCE?,I ordered this thinking Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson would be on it. There is not one song with Bruce and this is not mentioned anywhere on this site!!!
5,This Book Altered My Pre-Conceived Beliefs,"I'm a novice when it comes to the UFO phenomenon and I was pretty sure I knew what my beliefs were concerning UFO's. Then I read Mr. Evans' book. The detailed history of UFO's, the abundance of information in his notes, and the never before published Andrea Roberts case caused me to think and rethink my previous knowledge of the phenomenon for WEEKS after I turned the final page. The final chapters containing Chris Evans' research into the tablets and scrolls of antiquity blew me away! My mind continues to be intrigued by the possibility of WHO some of these visitors are and how long they have been influencing those of us on planet earth. This is a highly informative, intellectually researched resource on the UFO phenomenon, yet is much more than most would expect. I would highly recommend this book to anyone."
2,I would have given him three stars...,"if it wasn't for chapters 8 - 10. They had little to do with any actual conspiracy and were almost entirely based on the alleged personal experiences of, it seemed, one rather suspect individual. Those chapters probably should have been the subject of another book altogether.Still it was an overall decent read despite the author's abuse of the phrase ""double-entendre."" He seems to be a capable researcher so I'll likely read his next one.Interestingly, the book arrived apparently signed by the author. That's a first."
5,I had to buy multiple copies for all the people I love!,"This book was transformational. I now find it hard to have conversations about love with people who have not read this book. After reading it, I bought it for all the people I love!"
5,Brave,"Thankfully, bell hooks is always brave enough to tell it like it is. Love is a verb not a feeling. There is an obvious connection between love as experienced within families and abusive romantic relationships. Read and begin to think critically about these core survival issues.Her observations are wise. Her grasp of history is absolute. Her ideas stimulate intelligent and loving thought, conversation, and action. Read this book."
5,A Must-Read!,"bell hooks never ceases to amaze with her razor-sharp insight, and this book is no exception. I've found myself writing quotes from every chapter, and I'm fairly certain I'll read this book again and again. hooks' insight into the nature of love and our society's destruction of love's true nature is peerless. If you have ever felt like your love wasn't enough, or that you will never know true love, pick up this book.Honestly, read anything by bell hooks. Everyone should read bell hooks."
4,Love hooks?,Renewed hope. The second half of the book especially. She also reinforced my desire to read Rilke and led me to Erich Fromm.
5,A new paradigm for equality in love relationships,"bell hooks, once again, has blown the doors off of the status-quo of outdated paradigms. She is ahead of her time and always thinks out of the box. Love it"
5,This is the best book I read all summer!,I had to read five books for my high school advanced history course. All summer I was trying to find the perfect book. The last book I read was All Quiet on the Western Front. It was well worth the three month wait. At the end of this book I sat down and cried. It was the most dramatic book.
4,"All Quiet on the Western Front, trans.Brian Murdoch","The recent translation of the original German language novel, All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Remarque, offers a more realistic description of life for these young German students who volunteered to enlist in the First World War. Brian Murdoch offers a new translation of the original German edition and his translation is compelling, especially having restored those descriptions which were in the 1930s thought to be too offensive for the general public. Give it a read!"
5,One of My Favorite Books Ever,"This is one of the definitive pieces of fiction about war. I also count this as one of my favorite works of fiction ever. Erich Remarque experienced this war firsthand, and that comes through in the way that he wrote the book. The descriptions of trench warfare include details that only experience would be able to understand. The ending comes abruptly, and none of the characters in the story ever really take root in your mind. I suppose that is the point, the war leftpeople and families broken, it dehumanized everyone involved."
4,Good Fiction on Real events,Book provides a story based account of experiences in WWI from German POV. Some imaginary is unforgettable. Got me thinking more about the costs of war.
5,a moving read,"I read this in hight school, and yes it was an assignment,(fortunately my literature always made us think about the books we read instead of gripe about them in ignorance) but I loved it. Basically, it pulls no punches, sugarcoats nothing. The author is telling it like he knows it from being there - war is hell, no matter what it's fought for, no matter whose side you're on. Reading a book from the point of a German fighter and seeing how they were all just lost kids too brings it home. This is not Tolkien (no offense to a great author, of course); when we make war, we're fighting against other humans, not some scary enemy who has no feelings and is pure evil.Overall the writing was captivating and the story is still relevant. It really opens your mind if you let it. All leaders should read it before considering such a grave undertaking as war."
3,A Bit Disappointed...,"After reading many of the reviews praising this title, I expected more than what the book offered. Overall, this book was okay but I had some problems with it. First of all, I thought the author's description of locations and places was completely lacking...I hardly felt as if I was there with Paul in the trenches or in the bombed out town, etc. because I felt I had not been given enough detail of the surroundings. Secondly, I thought the ending was pretty terrible. Not because of what happened (I expected as much) but because of the way it was written. I felt as if the ending was rushed and it left me, the reader, wondering what happened, exactly. However, I don't want to say more so I don't spoil it for those who haven't read it. I just want to say that while I think this is worthy of a read, it isn't ""the masterpiece"" that some people have made it out to be. I have read a lot of other books in the same genre that are much better written."
4,Vivid descriptions of utter tragedy,This book succeeds in describing the horrors of war like no other book I have read before. It really puts you inside the head of a soldier on the front line during World War 1. It makes you angry at Prime Ministers/Presidents such as the George Bush's of the world who send these ordinary people to these hellholes which often ends up to be the death of them. It particularly makes you mad as the George Bush's do not have to sacrifice a drop of their own blood. As you can see this book really gets you thinking about the stupidity of war. In some ways it is a tremendous book but for me I did not like the writing style (that could be the translator's fault) & it took awhile for this to hook me. If you're struggling to get into this book just be patient as you will be rewarded.Recommended.
5,Read it all the way to the end,"My Freshman English class read this book about three months ago. I think about three of us actually read it. And the other two were complaining about it savagely. I felt really weird, because I thought it was awesome. Everyone was ""Oh, it's all gross!"" Of course it is! It's showing you war. How else do you think it's going to be? I don't think it was too gross to show. It made me cry. My favorite part was when Paul was stuck in the shell-hole with the French solider he killed. Wow, that was gutwrenching. I'm a fourteen year old girl and I like shopping and dressing up and writing and poetry but I definitely still got something from this book that a lot of kids in my school didn't seem to get. Maybe if they read it they would. This is wonderful."
5,A Must Read Classic,"Never have I read a book quite like this one. It's breath-taking descriptions and brilliant insight makes the reader think about the actions of man. Especially during war. This book is very old, but don't let its age fool you. It is a literary piece that compels any person who reads it. Brilliant!"
3,Good novel,This is a good novel about WWI. It is very introspective and so those looking for an action packed war novel need to look elsewhere. Required reading for high school students. But I am not sure it is the great novel everyone seems to think it is. Its main recommendation may be that it is the best anti-war novel to come from the WWI writer collection. That in itself may be the saddest thing of all as it was very definitely the lost generation for the Germans and French as well as the British. In some ways its limitations serve as a reminder of what that generation of writers might have accomplished if so many had not been killed in the war.
1,Abridged edition!,"The Pacemaker Classics edition is ""abridged and adpated""--I'd guess the word count is maybe 15% of the actual novel! It doesn't actually say that anywhere on the front or back cover, or on the Amazon page. Instead, the page links to copies and reviews of the full novel, as if it's just another edition."
4,If you would like to know about.....,"War, not only how the war was cruel, but also, how the soldiers feeling during the war, the novel would be great.Many people die at once. Soldiers have to overcome the friend's death. They need to sacrifice their lives to live day by day. They could kill people easily by using guns and bombs. Therefore, the death was not big deal for them at that time. They could not do anything that they wanted to do. They could not have things that we have. The war took their lives.How they felt during the war? What was the conflict? Watching dying people, how did they think about it?The novel tells not only the cruelness of the war, but also the happy and calm time during the war, their conflicts, and feelings."
1,So misleading--this PACEMAKER edition is ABRIDGED!,"Before I ordered this book I looked everywhere on the description to see if it is an abridged version. Nowhere was it stated ABRIDGED. I wish I had read the one star reviews before purchasing. Someone commented on another review that we should know it is abridged from the number of pages. That is BS--descriptions should be accurate--the customer should not have to guess if an edition is abridged or not. I don't know why there are so many 5 star reviews, unless people are just ignorant about what they are reading.By the way, the original novel, All Quiet on the Western Front, is excellent. Just don't buy this one."
5,Read It For Today,"This is quite simply the greatest first hand account of the horrors of warfare ever written. It should be read throughout the world, and perhaps it is even more important for people to read this book for today's sake than it ever has been before.While WWI greatly differs from the current conflict in Iraq, it seems that there are some elements of war that universal throughout history:Death, destruction, disillusionment, lies, and human suffering.I would recommend this book to anyone, regardless of nationality, race, religion, social class, etc. If you have yet to read this book, and the human condition is a subject that interests you, then this should be at the top of the list."
1,Good story but horrible edition,"This a very important work, perhaps a little dated in it's language but a classic nonetheless. BUT this particular edition is practically unreadable due to the formatting, typos and errors. It looks like a cheap knock-off and is very difficult to read. I ended up buying a different version to finish the story.Do yourself a favor and avoid this edition."
3,All is quiet on the western front because im sleeping,"This is a great book, the author uses the english language to cast a grim view of war and what it is like to be a soldier.the authors only problem with the book is that certain parts go on and on and they seem very vague. he also is not telling a story at most parts of the book but is constantly reflecting on everything, and this book has no action at all and is very boaring in that spectrum.also it is horrificly gorey and its like jumping into a cold bathtub.the contrast betweeen my life is so large it is pathetic and it really makes me happy that im not living in a place that is in wartime. The main character Paul is a really captivating character in his authenticity. he is very realistic and combined with the authors style of writing i found myself captivated reading this book all in one day. too bad at some parts it was going by like goo and slowling dripping by in its boaringness"
2,All Quiet On The Western Front Book Review,"The book All Quiet On The Western Front was an interesting book. I thought it was difficult to get into and that it wasn't very appealing. I may think this because I am not a big fan of war books. However, Remarque used stories from the time when he was in war and turned them into a fiction novel. I think that the movie portrays better what his novel is about. The movie from the nineteen 30's was very well put together. Overall I thought that the book was bland, boring and not a very interesting read. If you haven't experienced war or if you do not enjoy reading war based books then I do not recommend this book for you."
3,This is not the best War novel ever written,"I have wanted to read this for years. This is ""recommended"" summer reading in the US for eight graders. Finally after reading all the positive reviews in Amazon I picked up a copy.I have to say I was somehow disappointed, it depicts very well the absurdity of war and is very graphic and gory, it is also very slow and boring at times. It is definitely a book that will stir emotions on a positive or negative way, but if you want great war stories there are much better offers out there"
3,All Shattering in the Front,"All Quiet in the Western Front is a very good book, But it was not yet to 5 stars. Although in the book their was a lot of good war scenes,and details of soldiers on the front line. When reading this book it gives me a nice way to see how horribly tragic, and terrifying it must have been to be involved in this war. When I was reading this book, I don't think that people should necessarily go to the war. But anyways, their were parts that I didn't like about the book. But I still recomend it to all teenagers. I'ts a very emotional, and terrifying book that everyboby would like it, No matter what age you are. You should read it. What are you waiting for. Rush to your nearest library and check this book out."
2,I DON'T LIKE THIS BOOK,"I don't think that this is the best war book ,the reasons because don't show the war in a really interesting way compare with war book like night or others."
3,Greatest War Novel of All Time? I Think Not!,"This book has been called the greatest war novel of all time. It was good, but almost every Tom Clancy book is better. Red Storm Rising, which is solely about World War III, is a much better war novel that All quiet on the Western Front. You might say, ""Red Storm Rising is about a fictional war."" Fine, but what about all of the excellent books about the Holocaust? All Quiet is a good book, but not the greatest war novel of all time."
3,Interesting but a little slow,"This book was very interesting. It told about how bad war really is. It showed the bad conditions that soldiers had to deal with. The book told about how the soldiers would lose hope, and some would even want to die. I like the story, but I felt it was a little slow and boring at parts. One element that stuck out was the style the book was written in. There were chapters within a chapter. There would be a story and there would be another story in the same chapter. I think this book is best for people in or above high school because there are events that are very descriptive about injures and how the soldiers die. High schoolers understand what war is like, while younger kids wouldn't understand how bad war really is."
4,pretty good,"I finished this book in only two days, partly because it was so good. I pity the main character, Paul Baumer, because he is forever changed by his experiences in WWI. He doesn't fight because he really wants to; he fights because his schoolteacher cajoled the entire class into enlisting. He and his comrades trade with Russian prisoners, the ""enemies"". He is right when he says, ""We are fighting a war because the leaders of our country said to."" He also lost his life in a way because he lost his innocence and his youth. Things will never be the same for him. I had to read this book for school, and it is the second best school-book I have ever read (Night is first). This also partly explains why I finished it in only two days. My advice: read it, not because you have to, but because you want to."
5,"I see one of them ,his face upturned ,fall into wire cradle.",I am sixteen year old from Kosova and had just readen this book.This book showes war in realy realistic light.I was a direct witnes of the war . Iexperienced every thing that Poul did in the novel even though 16 year old Who want to now how the war is realy like read All quiet on the western front
2,Some insight into the Emotional and Physical Reality of War,"I did not feel like I was able to get much out of this book other than some of the harsh realities of war. I found all the stories to be repetitive thematically. While it was better than say Crane's THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE, it was not conveyed as intensly. Remarque uses simple words to try and convey powerful intense emotions, which was only somewhat effective. I did like reading something from the point of the losing Germans, but I found it still dull. Possibly someone who was in World War II or in live combat situations would appreciate more the great losses suffered by the protagonist."
2,Never read this book,"This book was so bad, I would never consider reading it again. The book was slow and boring, and the reading level is fairly low. Paul was a boring character and there was not much characterization. His friends were much the same and the small adventures they had were the only good parts. There was a lot of violence and it was not very good at keeping your attention."
2,"Would not recommend (Alfred, NY)","I personally did not like the book. I dont like stories about war, blood and guts. I found it to be very slow moving and boring. Paul seemed to have a very boring life, nothing ever changed. He was either shooting at other people, sitting around trying not to go insane or injured. The same goes for all of his friends. The book sort of seemed to go in circles. I would not recommend this book if you do not like war stories that go in circles."
2,Miss. Tierno fromm Tottenville LIESSSS!,"My global studies teacher made the class read this novel. It was suppose to be good. Wait she said ""great."" Take it from me. I hated it!"
2,Unenjoyable,I like most of what I read but this was slow and unenjoyable. The writer doesn't hold you much and I couldn't finish it. There are some plus sides to it though.
4,The agony of war,"I was told that this was an excellent book. When I read it, I was slightly disappointed because the book is all morals of the war and hardly any plot. Even with this degration, it is an excellent book."
5,"Thought this was another boring, school assigned book. Wrong","I really dreaded the thought of picking up this book. It was a war story and I am not to big on war stories. After a couple chapters on obtaining food and going to the bathroom in a group I started to realize the meaning of the book. Paul was fighting, not for or against his country, but fightring to end hate. These boys didn't even know what the reason for their fighting was. They only ""knew"" they were right and France was wrong. Paul started to question what he ""knew"" and how he ""knew"" it."
4,All Quiet on the Western Front,"Paul Baumer, was a young man or we could say a kid. War is bad and many people can die with it. Paul and some other classmates were chosen to assist a German War. Paul and his friends were only young kids and they assisted this war, knowing that it could be dangerous. Being so young they don't understand the world around them. And when they participate in the war they will feel all the pain and will feel afraid. During the war the kids suffered from hunger and many other things. The saw how every men died in front of their eyes. They saw and experienced many things that they would only see in the war. Paul felt sad and also very lonely. All his classmates and many other that had been with him in the war died. He wanted to survive and get out alive, but it was very hard and a sniper killed him."
2,poor printing,"The literature speaks for itself; the text is classic. The printing itself, however, is very poor. Paragraphs are sporadically positioned and oddly broken up, making it difficult to read at times. Baaarely worth the discounted price. Upgrade if you want a better quality copy."
4,All Quiet on the Western Front,"I enjoyed the book, it was an easy read and the author grabed my attention. The first part of the book was slow when the setting and background picture was painted. But after that it just took off like a rocket. I reall liked that this book was written from the Germen perspective and the author whent into ditails of the life on the front. This book showed the gruesom truth and reality of the war."
4,All Quiet on the Western Front Deserves 4 Stars,"All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque is a tantalizing story. The reader is exposed to the hardships that come along with World War 1, from a German Soldier's point-of-view. Paul (the main character), is a brave teenager who must face everything horribly imaginable. From the death of the friends he grew up with to not knowing what to do with his life after the war, he teaches all of us a lesson. The gore, death and famine interweaved in the book is overwhelming but necessary to have the reader experience what the young soldiers must live through. This story is not only a life lesson teacher but an important part of our world's history. For these reasons and others untold, this novel deserves 4 stars. Read the book and see through Paul's eyes the tragic lifestlye of a soldier fighting for his country in World War 1."
5,Excellent...,"This book is brilliant...one of the best, if not the best, anti-war novels ever written. Not much else I can say about it, except that I would recommend a viewing of the film from 1930, with Lew Ayres as Paul Bäumer, as a supplement to the book."
4,"A little beat up, but good.","This, along with one other book, was the first to come in. They were pretty fast in getting here, which is good, and the price was right. You can tell its well used, but not beyond further use especially got the class its for."
3,Frightening and real,"Known as the ""greatest war novel of all time"". The story is told both in the first person and in the present tense, which makes the reality of Paul Baumer's experience that much greater. It is somewhat graphic in places but not unreasonably so. War novels are most often told from the perspective of the lowest ranks; something of the experience of the Everyman."
3,Typical war story,"This book was about some soldiers in WWI. They met when they first came to fight in the war, and stuck together ever since. They helped each other in many ways, and I really liked how the story of the war from their point of view was told. I didn't like, however, the fact that not much was mentioned about the fact that they were fighting in WWI. It was mentioned once or twice, but there wasn't really anything said about the names of the battles they fought and stuff like that. It's nice to read if you want to know how war really is, but if you're looking for details about WWI, this isn't the book for you."
5,Best War Book Out There!,"No book has ever showed the reader the horrors of war quite like this one has. i recommend it to everyone, even if you don't enjoy reading these types of books, you will be amazed at the details this book gives you as it follows the trails of Paul Baumer. It is a book that should be read to understand that war is more than just two sides of people shooting at each other."
4,All Quiet on the Western Front,This book was different than most war stories. It was from a German point of view and was exciting throughout the story. I would recomend this to anyone!!!
4,All Quiet on the Western Front,"All quiet on the Western Front depicted war very well. It portrayed the images of war in great detail. The book grabs you and makes you want to read more. At times it can be very depressing, but it was and still is the reality of war."
3,This book was hard to get into but the end is worth it,"This book was really hard to get into. Although now that I think about it, all the details were actually a major reason for the book's success, while reading, the details got kind of boring. Details though, everytime I think about the book I think details. The author definately knows how to bring you into his emotions and feelings. If you like detail you'll love this book."
3,"""Leather"" Bound","I was disappointed that the book was small, not leather but cardboard, and of inferior quality. For $14 I expected more."
4,* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *,"""On the threshold of life, they faced an abyss of death...""This written on the cover of Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front. That sentence sums up EXACTLY what this book is all about. It starts off rather slow descibing what life is all about in the rear, you would think that life in the rear would be completely different then in the front but the real only difference is instead of worring about dying from a bullet they were worring about dying of starvation. This book was packed with action and gore, if you are a war fanatic I highly recommend reading this book."
5,Can we ban all wars please?,"If this book didn't cause politicians and other war-mongering world leaders to look for less violent approaches to problem-solving, they probably didn't read it. Maybe this was written about a war that happened ages ago, the same thing still happens today: young people go to arms unknowing of the realities of the battlefield. When one thinks of it, the citizens who fight the wars don't have any reason to fight the ""enemies"" who are also individual citizens somewhere else. It should be the case that politicians get together and duke it out if they have problems to solve and not to get everyone else involved. There would be fewer problems that way."
5,A damn good book,"Brilliant. Brilliant. Brilliant. If you're plannning to buy a book one of these days, this will be it. Don't borrow it from the library, BUY IT.Because it's worth every cent you spent."
4,I understood it!,"Reading All Quiet may be a bit harder in 2002 than it was in 1929. For one thing, we've got dozens of gory bloody war movies, even more vivid books, magazine articles, History Channels documentaries, etc. etc. etc. But I tried to appreciate this work in the environment of its release - 1929. And I can see why it made such a splash. It was a pretty visionary and new way to depict war. I admit I only read it for a class, but it was far less painful than most required literature. I could actually feel for Paul Baumer and his friends; I shared his frustration, his fleeting moments of joy, his desperation, and his growing numbness in the trenches and doubt in his superiors. My only qualm with this book is that it doesn't seem to be leading anywhere, story-wise. It seems to be more of a literary picture than a story. And as such, it succeeds admirably."
2,Slow boring book,"This book was not very good. It digressed to much. The main character, Paul was a flat character with too many thoughts. It was trajic and to vivid in some parts. I would not recommend it."
5,"Unusually packaged, but I got it!","The book came wrapped in cardboard and tape, but nothing was damaged. Great buy! Awesome book, very intense and graphic. I had to read it for an AP European History class."
5,A Man Destroyed by the Sorrow of War,"I will be a sophomore this year in high school. Last year I read this book in English class and it completely reconstructed my perspective of war. This book thoroughly describes how Paul Baumer and his comrades were destroyed not only physically, but emotionally too. They did not have to die throught the shells that were snaring them, but only a phsycological death. Great book full of suspense, romance, and tragedy. I'm glad my teacher selected it."
5,A book everyone should read,All Quiet on The Western Front is a great classic that goes deep into the soul of life and death. The book brings up great questions to ponder on the humankind of man and the nature of man itself. Great Read!
5,"This Book, Like War, Will Change You","Paul Baumer goes into war as most do - a green kid. He is changed into someone different -- as War changes all it touches. And as War changes all it touches, this book will change you."
1,blaahh,"This book had a good writer and all, but way too grusome. I mean I feel sorry for all of the people who had to go through that, but that description made me put the book down. I could not finish reading this novel!"
1,Publisher,"Formatting errors abound, umlauts are not printed correctly, and the back cover has a misspelling. I highly recommend you buy this book from another publisher. It does not seem as though the publisher deemed it worthwhile to take even a cursory glance over the book before printing it."
4,Classic,"The useage of rather straightforward simple, yet beautiful language makes this a classic vivid account of WW I. And in a way timeless, as the problems th eyoung soldiers face and the psychological effects of war still seem comparable today.A classroom of german boys volunteers and are send to the Western front. Yet the realities of war are very different from their expectations. They find that people at home have no clue about the life they lead. In the end, eachother is all they have. And they are bound to loose that too.The book was followed by Der Weg Zurück (Road back), in which the last survivors try to fit in postwar society.Both are highly recomended."
3,.,"This book was OK. I bought it after my mother's death to cancer hoping to find some similarities to my situation, but apparently nobody interviewed for this book experienced intense guilt and severe depression."
5,My Sony VAIO RX 560 Turned Me into a Computer Addict,"I had three nightmare HP Pavilion 7940s, in only three months. They literally took a summer and a fall out of my life. Then, I bought this Sony. Quite literally, it has turned me into a com-puter freak. It has me roaming the Internet, downloading, uploading, reloading, uninstalling, and then reinstalling, just to play with it! I even subscribed to about ninety tech emags and regular magazines because it has opened up my interest that much in the new technology! It is fast, efficient, and ridiculously stable. It is not normal not to crash like this one never does. Also, it came with XP, which is the best thing Bill has done since '95. The HPs had ME, which is proof that terrorists have siezed contol of our nation's computer systems."
5,great book ....,This book is great. It tells a simple story about not giving up and turning worngs into rights. I think it's a great book for kids of all ages young and old. I hope this review helps. Have a nice day !!
4,pleased,Pleased with my purchase. Very glad to have this childhood memory. Prompt service and as described in description. Recommend this seller.
3,Fun Story - Page Missing,"All in all the book was in fair shape, not good. One page was torn and there was a page missing. To a 1 year old, that doesn't make any difference, but would like this company to be more careful about their own reviews. I read and saw nothing about these abnormalities when I purchased the book from them. Buyer, be careful. Maybe email and ask specific questions before purchasing."
5,Sweetest childrens' story,I remember this book from my childhood but have lost it since. I was very pleased to see it on sale at amazon. This is the cutest book. It reminds me of my own naughty dog! I will treasure this new copy and share it with my kids.
5,I Loved this book!,"When I was younger, my mom gave this book to me and I read it all the time. We moved a few times and could no longer find it. I have since been through college and am a teacher. We have continued to look for the book, even when I worked in a book store, to no avail. We could not remember the author's name. Thank you so much for having this book within your books. It means so much to me."
4,Inexpensive but durable!,"I ordered these Trucks for my son's first birthday. Well I gave in and gave them to him early. He's had them for a month now, and he is now 10 months old. He loves them. Out of nowhere he no longer enjoys his teethers & rings, he enjoys pushing trucks around!These have made it thru a month of destruction! He chews, throws, drops, and pushes them into everything, and they still look brand new. They do feel like cheap plastic, but what do you expect for such an inexpensive toy. I am very excited for this summer when we can play with them in his new sandbox! (Since I gave these to him before his 1st birthday, We had to go out and buy something else.. lol!)I do recommend these inexpensive toys!!"
5,Perfect first trucks,These were a gift for my godson's first birthday. They really are tough little trucks - perfectly able to hold up to a toddler. They're nice and chunky for small hands and colorful enough to get his attention.
5,Excellent trucks,"These are very well made. The wheels are so well balanced that on our hardwood floors when pushed they keep going until they run into a wall. Which of course delights the toddler who pushed them.They are now one of his favorite toys (he has to carry one in the car with him) and have taken a lot of abuse but they still keep rolling.They are plastic, but whatever plastic they are made of is very durable.When I first bought them I thought them a little pricey - but not now. They are worth every penny."
2,Not that great.,"Trucks were to be a gift, but they looked cheaply made and did not seem to be worth the money. I decided to return them."
5,Fun little tough trucks,"So far so good with these little trucks. My 18 month old son has tried once or twice to separate the cement mixer part of the truck from the truck frame but it's still in one piece. Very cute, tough and they roll pretty good, too."
4,toys,"cute toy trucks, have held up well, just small and kids outgrow these type toys too quickly but adequate for toddlers"
4,Good trucks for the future,These little trucks will stand up to years of wear both inside and in the sandbox. Was very pleased to give them for a birthday present
3,Not as good as some of his other works ...,"The Sodom & Gomorrah soundtrack, by Miklos Rozsa, was a but too 'sturm und drang"" for me. The few quiet middle-eastern pieces are outnumbered by stentorian buglings. But then it is a soundtrack and has to complement whatever is happening on screen (God help us ...). I prefer Rozsa's beautiful music for Ben Hur and King of Kings; if they're what you're looking for they're what you should buy."
1,Out of date,This book has a copyright date of 1994. The Communications Decency Act was passed in 1996. The DMCA was passed in 1998. The Patriot Act was passed in 2001. This book is out of date.
3,Not Sure,Got this book then found out I didn't need it. Sold it for more than I paid. God bless amazon.com
2,Not a Good Resource,"Was very hard to follow for a College Reading class. Includined a whole bunch of long stupid readings with no point to reading them. Exercises are very vogue, and this book includes alot of information that is not needed. Would not recommend to anyone"
5,Weber Summit Platinum B4 Grill,"Awesome, I got the grill I wanted. Worth the extra Cash! No issues with delivery and building took around two hours, just take your time and read. Really enjoy the extra space and being able to have more control over tempertaure with four seperate controls, makes grilling for eight easy! ( this encludes the whole meal!)"
3,second try any better,"I have replaced all but one of the original power window regulators in our '02 Jeep GCL. I'm a little concerned in that this is the second Dorman regulator in less than a year. I had tried another nameless brand, and one lasted exactly 4 cycle before it died.The Dorman regulators appear to be the best re-engineered, at least according to their website. Maybe this one just had a quality issue that escaped. Here's hoping I won't have to replace this one anytime soon."
2,Doesn't do a thing for me,"I've taken ginseng before, and I thought it was doing something for me. It gave me a sensation of warmth like you would get from a good workout and I guess gave me a little bit of energy. These pills, however, do nothing for me at all. Placebo effect? Probably. Working for me this time around? No.Giving it 2 stars because at least it didn't do something negative to my health."
1,Pills are too big,These pills are shaped like little footballs and they turned out too be to big for me to swallow. Needless to say it's a disappointment that I can't use them.
5,THIS MOVIE HAS TWO COREYS AND LOTS OF LAUGHS AND IT JUST TAKES ME BACK TO THE 80'S!!!!!!!,"License to Drive is a great comedy and what can i say it has Corey Fieldmen and Corey Haim!!!!! It's about a guy named Les and he goes for his drivers license,but he ends up failing!!!! When his parents find out they take the keys away and he is also trying to impress a hot girl which is played by Heather Graham!!!!! One night with his grandfather's 73 Chevy ends up in a night from hell!!!!! It is a great laugh out loud comedy with great acting and of course our favorite the two Coreys!!!! This dvd is a must in any collection!!!!!!!"
5,What more could you ask for?,"I waited patiently for this DVD to come out. Ok, maybe not so patiently. Buuuut, I finally got my copy of License To Drive. I couldn't be more excited. Corey Haim, Corey Feldman and Heather Graham drunk and locked in the trunk of a hot car- what else could you possibly want in a light-hearted 80's teen movie!? This movie is an 80's classic! I would say it's even better than most of the Brat Pack stuff... This DVD is top notch. The extras are very cool. Interviews with both the Coreys! I've already watched the DVD start to finish twice this weekend!!!License To Drive is Pure 80's fun. A must have..."
3,FINALLY THIS MOVIE'S COMING OUT!,"Finally it's getting a DVD release. This is a fun film. Heather Graham, Corey Haim and Corey Feldman are fun characters to watch, I've liked this film for a long time, it's always been a film as a kid I had hired a number of times and always remembered."
5,A Corey Haim MUST-SEE!!,"I have seen this movie over 20 times between 12 and 22 years old. Haim plays a teen who failed his driving test, but pretends that he passed so he have the car for a date. He gets into car accidents, close calls with the cops, and ends up with a passed out drunk date. His parents are also well played, and it ends with somewhat predictable, but still hilarious mishaps. Any Haim fan has got to see this movie!"
5,License to Drive Review,I first saw this movie on HBO when I was growing up...when I eyed it at Amazon I knew I had to buy it. My roommate and I watched it the same day it arrived and it still made us laugh. highly Recommend purchasing
2,A childhood favorite translates poorly into adulthood.,"I watched this movie a bazillion times as a child (VHS). In the wake of Corey Haim's unfortunate passing I decided to relive a moment of childhood bliss and watch License To Drive again. Unfortunately, the magic is long past for me. You cannot look past the terrible writing and direction of this movie. I did get some laughs out of it, don't get me wrong, but the majority of laughs were at the expense of the terrible film-making and uninspired dialogue. This is a tween/teen movie from the 80s that certainly deserves a tombstone unlike Mr. Haim. The soundtrack is fairly abysmal, although the Frank Sinatra holds it's own. This is not a movie worth watching. Spread over the course of an approximate 140 minutes, there are about 3 minutes worth of brilliance. If you want to see ""the coreys"" in action, rent ""the lost boys""... it is a far better picture."
4,"Good DVD, absence of subtitles in Language English.",The participation of Corey Haim is spectacular. The story is cool (good entertainment). The absence of subtitles in Language English and in other languages is lamentable.Tidus
5,A blast from the past!,"I grew up watching this movie, horrified that I would one day have to get my license. Thankfully, my experience wasn't as bad as Corey Haim's in the film. This movie is just light and breezy fun and it accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do. The Blu-Ray image is probably as good as can be expected given the film's low-budget 80s roots. I don't have a surround sound system so I can't accurately judge audio quality but it sounded fine to my ears. Unfortunately, you might want to keep the DVD for the extras. This Blu-Ray includes the trailer and a featurette not on the DVD but the DVD includes (then recent) interviews with the Coreys, an okay commentary with the writer and director, and an alternate ending - nothing amazing but it's too bad the Blu-Ray skimps on this stuff."
4,Pretty Entertaining 80's Comedy,"License To Drive isn't as good as The Lost Boys, another 80's movies starring the two Corey's. But it is pretty entertaining. It's not a laugh a minute or anything, but it does have enough laughs to make me recommend it. The best is saved for late in the movie, when Corey Haim has to drive his grandpa's car backwards to get his pregnant mother to the hospital. That scene is a riot! And Heather Graham sure was cute in this movie, and had killer legs."
4,divers,vieux film mais tellement vrai tellement bien joue.... j'ai avec moi la partie 2 mais il me manque le film original.
4,Need DVD...Need DVD,I've been waiting for this film to come out on DVD for a while now. Please somebody...do something. It's a great movie. Very inspiring.
2,review,I received tablets instead of capsules. I wanted capsules which are easier to swallow than tablets but that is not what I received.
4,Good stuff,"I ordered this stuff as a beard groomer. It works well, makes my beard soft and manageable. I recommend it."
5,Are you an actor? Aspiring actor? Read this..,"If you're an actor, this is mandatory reading. Also read ""A Leap From the Method"" by Allan Rich. You won't regret reading either, and you will gain a lot..just trust me."
3,"I read it, but I don't remember it.","I do remember some really good lessons being in this book. Unfortunately, I just remember there being good lessons...but not what they are.This is a great book for the serious actor. That's not me. I act to be an idiot. I don't act to be deep or emotional. I'm not knocking the book, but it's not for me. I respect Uta Hagen's methods though."
2,A birthday present,"Got this for my 6 yr old's birthday present, he's played it a couple times in the past month but doesnt seem to be to interesting to him."
4,"Pretty little stereo, in red...","I just purchased this little stereo for my bedroom and it's wonderful. Very sleek in design and I enjoy the classic knobs and features. The remote control only works on the cd player and that's a bit disappointing. But, it puts out a lot of sound for a small unit and it fits just about anywhere."
2,Far Short of His Potential,"I've listened to, and enjoyed, Phil Keaggy's music since his days with The Glass Harp. I have to say though that this recording is in my opinion quite wide of the mark. ""Roundabout"" has a couple of fine moments on it, but overall it's a very poor outing. It may in fact be his worst recording since ""True Believers"". After 40 years and dozens of recordings we can't expect them all to be jems. This one I believe falls far short of what most people would expect from Keaggy. I think it's important to be honest with reviews even of our most cherished musicians. I would hate to think that some poor person or tennager without much money had spent it on this badly made CD when they could have spent it on one of Keaggy's best. Also, a first time listener may never give any of his better music a chance if they hear this CD first."
3,"Great Start, Poor Ending","I have read all of Brenda Joyce's books and I am usually satisfied with her writing. I was especially looking forward to reading the Darkest Heart because it seemed different from her others. More culture and in depth history. But about half way through the book, Candice's character becomes annoying. She says she is a lady, but the way she speaks and acts is like a spoiled child. She has no sense of the word culture and is ignorant about Apache life style. Even after being captured several times, she does not conform to their rules and talks about them in a negative way. Jack's character was super hot in the begining, but after a few times I realized he just can't keep his pants on. The excuse is always, I haven't had a woman in a long time. I just wanted Candice to grow up and stop worrying about what other people think and for Jack to decide which side he will choose."
5,masterpiece of intertwined emotional romance novel,"It's a definitely your bookshelf keeper.while reading this novel,you may feel all emotions existed in our lives.I love all romance novels with gut wrenching stories.This is one of them."
3,not the best,"I love Brenda Joyce. This wasn't one of my favorites. The hero showed a complete lack of loyalty to his woman and his child that was on the way. I understand his needto fight for his Indian heritage, but what about the woman he loves and her child. Leaving her alone totally turned me against him.....She was a complete idiot! Her prejudiceswere overwhelming. It was hard to like either characters. I know times were different, but when you love someone they should come first."
5,Another great Brenda Joyce!,"Brenda does it again! A great read, the characters had so much chemistry the pages were hot!Great read!"
1,did not expect this!,"I just could not like Jack, I did at first when he rescued Candice but from then on it just went downhill. He never seemed concerned about her, nor the rapes and abuse she suffered, then when she's pregnant he leaves her, not to mention the other woman and him expecting candice to just get used to it.....I was not expecting this story to turn out so bad."
1,Sierra Club Guide to Safe Drinking Water reviewed,One would expect a more thorough treatment from a reputable group like the Sierra Club. This book is more of an outline of what SHOULD be covered; the detail on many important topics is either sketchy or completely lacking. This is a shame given the lack of good reference sources on what is a very basic health and public safety issue. I would recommend that interested readers check out Colin Ingram's book instead.
2,Not a fun read,"This book is an account of a colony of mutants who are invaded by the scientists who want to carry on experiments with them.Some of the sex scenes are gross and distateful. The scheme is arbitrarily worked out--the mutants know some things and not others, with little rational relationship. I found the book uncomfortable to read and I was glad when I was finished reading it."
1,Did Nothing,No effect at all on the leather I tried to clean. I returned it. I do not recommend this product.
4,Excellent Computer,"I am a gadget geek. I expect the highest quality products for the lowest cost, and usually receive that. In this case, I got more than expected. I bought his computer 5 years ago in January of 2000, and it still is VERY reliable. In fact, its the only one I use. I have only had two problems so far with the computer in its long 5 years existance. Once last year and once two years ago, it constantly was resetting and not logging on. It was cause by an internal error, but probably becasue it was old and not faulty chip set or anything. Also, warranty is a big problem. Sony expects you to dish out $90 to talk to you out of warranty. For people who don't care about looks or dvd writing ability, I reccomend this computer. It is reliable and sturdy. Also, it is very upgradable, so that is also a plus."
4,Computer Value,"I think that the computer has good value for money and quality, pretty much all round but the only thing that dents this almost flawless design is that it doesn't have an internal modem! The PC is photo quality and it has the adobe photo shop which is fantastic but I think that it would be complete with an internal modem, age:12"
4,The Man They Left Out,"The most exciting runner of all time was Hugh McElhenny. They left him out. If you've never heard of him, check out some of those old grainy black-and-white films of the 1950s. He played for the 49ers. The first time he touched the ball in the NFL was a kickoff he ran back for a TD. In one season, he averaged over 8 yards per carry. That's not a typo. And that's in the NFL, not college. He did similarly amazing things in college at the U of Washington. He's a member of the NFL Hall of Fame, but they left him out. In the pantheon of most exciting football players of all time - that's most EXCITING, not necessarily the ranked best - it might look something like this:1) McElhenny2) Gale Sayers3) Barry Sanders4) Roger Staubach5) John Elway6) Jim BrownSure, Montana's not on here, but that's because he wasn't really that exciting. He was like a machine. Great, sure, but machines aren't exciting. Joe wasn't exciting.McElhenny was. He was the King, but they left him out."
4,Excellent value,I felt that this is one of the best Football books. The pictures are excellent and it truly a good value for the price I paid. I would highly recommend it to any Football fan.
4,Not for Rookies,This book while highly detailed and though provolking is not for those who are newcomers to Cover-up theorists. I recomend reading a mark lane book before this one.
4,"Excellent book, take the time to read it, its worth it!","I felt that this book was well worth the time that it took toread. Groden and Livingstone wrote in-depth all of the inaccuracies ofthe Warren's Report and other conflicting evidence that our government states as being the truth. The only negative thing that I can say about this book is that it can be a bit confusing and takes quite a bit of time to read. I am sure that I will be re-reading it again to pick up on parts that never did sink in. Others have put this book down by saying that Groden made all of the evidence fit his ""theory"" of a conspiracy. A theory is a speculation just like how the Warren's Report is a theory, its not true fact and most of use would agree with that.Overall, very good book, worth the time to read. Remember, keep an open mind."
3,A good primer for Assassination buffs,"Origionally written in '88, Livingstone was not able to update his information when he re-released this book. Although he does include an appendix with new information about the Z-film and the X-rays. I'd recommend reading his latest book Killing Kennedy or Jim Fetzer's Assassination Science, both of which have explosive new evidence of forgery in the photographic evidence.Both books explore the historic work of Dr. David Mantik, a radio-oncologist, who was given permission to study the X-rays of Kennedy. Using a devise called an optical densitometer he has irrefutable proof that areas of Kennedy's skull that nearly all the Dallas doctors say was blasted out has been covered artificially. This along with Fetzer's examination of the Z-film shed a whole new light on the assassination. We now have SCIENTIFIC proof, not speculation like the Warren Commission had!"
1,Watch out for HP Support,"Watch out for HP Pavilion ""support."" HP answers the phone during the warranty support, but once you go on the extended contract, HP is no longer the manager of the support. If you try to cancel your extended contract, HP keeps 75% of the money you paid and there is no recourse - even if you don't get any service. I found the basic HP support hot-line to be almost useless. The answer to everything is ""we need you to format your hard drive"". I have 3 Pavilions and I guess I was fairly stupid. I will not buy another."
2,FASCO 182,"THE PRODUCT WAS RECEIVED DAMAGED. THE PLASTIC FAN WAS BROKE AND FELL OFF THE UNIT. IT WAS DOUBLE BOXED AND WELL PACKED. BOTH BOXES WERE IN VERY GOOD SHAPE, WHICH MAKES ME BELIVE IT WAS PACKING PROBLEM AND NOT A SHIPPER PROBLEM. I HAD TO HAVE IT RIGHT AWAY, SO EPOXIED IT TOGETHER INSTEAD OF RETURNING. ALSO YOY HAVE TO PAY CLOSE ATT. TO SHIPPING CHARGES.IT SAYS $9.95, BUT IF YOU SCROLL DOWN, THERE IS ALSO $.50 PER POUND ON TOP OF IT."
1,Horrible,Item didn't ship for several weeks and it took even longer (without a tracking number) for it to get here. Item arrived in a brown envelop that was too small and the product was BENT by the manufacturer to fit it in and close the envelope. The thing snapped in half after I took it out of the envelope. Piece of junk.
5,Gave it to my Mom,"Pretty bracelet. But since the blue (shades vary in gemstones)wasn't quite in my color palette I gave it to my Mom, who hardly wears anything that isn't blue."
4,"It's good, but not as good as others.....","Finger Eleven has always been at the top of my list of favorite bands since their major debut Tip was released, and I of course looked forward to their third effort. While with Grayest of Blue Skies I was left in awe, this album was merely enjoyable. There's nothing wrong with the songs, I'll admit there are many high points. Scott sings better then he ever has, and Sean is playing awesome bass lines through most of the songs, but besides that there is little to warrant placing it above (pun intended) their other efforts. Lyrically F11 takes a step down, as only a few very bright spots exist around the middle of the album. Overall musically they are the same as always, and that's fine.I did indeed enjoy listening to the album, it's a great rock album, but after two very growth-induced albums, I truly expected more from F11. Go out and buy it for sure, as the dvd is worth it alone, just make sure you have the older ones also."
3,"If you like this band, Buy the other two","This CD is OK if you have never heard the other two albums. But once you hear the greyest of blue skies or tip, you will understand what i am saying. The day I bought this was the first day it came out (June 17, 2003). Burn this one from a friend, but buy the other two to make up for the lost revenue from the band.P.S The best C.D from these guys is THE GREYEST OF BLUE SKIES, not TIP."
4,Decent Release,"good cd but doesnt come anywhere near tip or greyest of blue skies. the dvd that comes with the cd is good it has a live performance featuring quicksand, and first time and some others which i like."
2,Finger eleven review,"I looked into this band because one of their songs ""One Thing"" was featured on the show ""Smallville"". This song has been on the radio as well. However, the rest of the album is nothing like this song. I am not a heavy metal type of music lover and so I did not appreciate any other songs on this album. Someone who is interested in Creed or Nickleback may enjoy this album. As for me, I only liked the one song."
3,Mediocre album from an amazing band,"I had very high expectations for this album after Greyest of Blue Skies blew me away back in 2000. I have to say out of their 3 full length releases this is their weakest. Tip was very well rounded and excellent, GOBS was very dark, brooding, and haunting...this album just felt very plain. ""Stay in Shadow"", ""Good Times"", and ""Absent Elements"" are great tracks, but the rest are mediocre. ""One Thing"" is definitely the worst track on the album, it is very repetitive and boring.Finger Eleven is a great band, I just got to see them live for the first time in LA a month ago and they rocked. Even this album which I feel is their weakest still is far superior to most bands at their top form, which says a lot about the level of talent in this band. I just hope their next release takes a step back and stirs up something more interesting."
4,Nothing wrong with mainstream...,"Alright, so I first heard ""Good Times"" on the soundtrack of EA Sports' SSX3, and fell in love with ""One Thing"" on the radio. The problem is, people don't like to admit that songs like these two are melodic, catchy, and just plain good. ""Good Times"" and ""Other Light"" still have the feel of a not-so-mainstream rock album, while some of the others, mainly the two acoustic songs, have the ability to catch the ears of those who previously were not Finger Eleven fans.My main argument is that people today are selfish, because they want a band all to themselves. Finger Eleven used to be your band, right? And then they sold out, right? WRONG. Just because they're on the radio does not mean they are any worse than they were before. It means they are icreasing their range of sounds and their number of fans. It's a matter of growth.Get the cd, it's worth it. It's ok to buy it because you heard the songs on the radio...geez."
4,Jeff's review,"I like a thew songs by this band , I bought this CD mostly for a song that is featured on the burn out 3 game ""Stay in Shadow "" , I also enjoy the song "" One Thing"" , I don't regret buying this CD, I soon found the whole CD is pretty good.Buy it !"
4,Finger Eleven Suprise,Well i was on launch.com 1 day and all the sudden one thing comes on playing i wasnt in the mood for the song so i check out there page latter...after listening to Good times...i played one thing after listening to them i thought Damn...these guys are good....so i bought there cd and was shocked...almost everysong on there was great!!! I'd have to complicated questions was a definnent hit....great song 11/5 stars...go buy the cd its a sure fire CD
5,Not as good as TGOBS but still amazing.,"At first when i heard this album, i was slightly dissapointed. Although the album was enjoyable it still couldn't hold very well as a follow up to the utterly amazing ""The Greyest of Blue Skies."" Then as i began to listen, the sings soon grew on me, although they can't quite reach the melodical and compositional genious they had in the previous album, they still create the music that traps you and keeps you listening to the album over and over again."
5,another great addition to their phenomenal careers,"I still haven't bought the CD yet, but being a HUGE (and i mean big) fan of Finger Eleven since I bought ""Greyest of Blue Skies"" nearly 3 years ago, I have waited and waited until they came out with a new CD. It's a bit different than their other CDs, just as mind-blowing though. ""Good Times"" is an awesome first single to begin to introduce many Americans to their talent. I recommend to anyone that they buy this CD and every other Finger Eleven CD, because once you start listening you can never stop, that's how I feel anyways, no words can describe what the music does to you."
4,Not that great....,"It's actually deserving of 3.5 stars...but I rounded up.They are trying to become Staind...and they aren't very good at it. There are no Awake and Dreaming's, no Stay and Drown's, no Above's on this cd. Tip was definitely their best album, and judging by this, they will never beat it...they won't even beat TGOBS. All in all, it's worth downloading, but don't buy it like i did."
2,Disappointing.,"For any fans of Finger eleven's last CD (The Grayest of Blue Skies), which was in my opinion one of the best CDs I have ever listened to (and I have over 500), you will be disappointed with their new self titled CD. You will not find any songs on this CD with the heavy raw emotion of dramatic feeling that their last CD was filled with. Instead, you will find a healthy dose of the same kind of plain, trendy music that is filling the radio airways everyday. If you like Nickleback or Default, buy this CD, if you like heavy music with alot of feeling, buy Finger Eleven's last CD if you don't already have it."
2,Big Dissapointment!!,"Are they the Finger Eleven who made the album ""Greyest Of Blue Sky"" ??? I think this album is a very big dissapointment. Greyest Of Blue Sky is one of my favorite album, their songs in that album blows!!.. How come this new album sounds terrible? the only strenght on this album is the song ""One Thing, Sad Exchange and Stay In Shadow"" and the others are crap. Well, if your a big fan of F11 then take this make it one of your collections :)"
1,What's going on?,"BOOOO! How can anyone even stomache this album! Maybe I am just a simpleton, but does this sound even remotely close to Finger Eleven I once, well, liked a lot. Don't get me wrong, Greyest of Blue Skies is a great album, but they sound terrible. It's like tuning in to listen to a bunch of no talent hacks. Please god, save your money and get yourself some real music i.e. In Flames, All that Remains, As I Lay Dying, The Crown, etc."
4,Finger Eleven - Self-Titled Album,Fun album with lots of different tracks. Refreshing not to hear the same song over and over again. I recommend this good album.
3,noT AS good as the greyest of blue skies,"I don't dislike this album at all, but i have to say that it is very predictable, it sounds very structured (it sounds like a boring nu-metal radio band), and with this finger eleven is losing all the Dynamism that they showed in their last albums."
4,Get the FINGER,"I generally don't write much in music reviews (with some notable exceptions of artists whose works I follow more closely), but I will say that FINGER ELEVEN's ""Finger Eleven"" can almost be measured on the pure emotional depth of this CD's cut, ""One Thing."" It's an incredible powerful statement on a philosophy for life, and, if these artists continue to dedicate themselves to their ""one thing,"" they should have a long, fruitful career!"
2,borderline complete and udder trash,"i hate saying bad things about a band that put out one of my favorite albums ever (tip). but...downhill doesn't even describe what happened to this band. they went from tip, which every song was WONDERFUL, to GOBS, which, in my opinion, only had 2 or 3 good songs on it, to this album, which has NOT ONE GOOD SONG ON IT.they started out sounding kind of post-grunge...which was most excellent. now they sound like...well, any pop-metal band you can pick up (trapt, for example).not to mention the musical complexity on this album is laughable.buy tip, then go look for another good band, because this band offers no more greatness."
1,One Hit,"Restless tonightCause I can no longer writeHalf decent rhymesThough ""Tip"" was just fineIt's what the record label plannedWe're slaves to the manSo I'll just have to whineUntil money is mineIf I traded it allIf I gave it all away for one hitJust for one hitIf I spewed it outIf I knew all about this one hitWouldn't that be some hitI promise I mightWrite a decent songMaybe next timeBut I might be wrongEven though I knowThat this song blowsYeah I guess I knowI just hate how it sounds"
3,"One Thing sucks, get over it already","that's about all i have to say. i knew that song wasn't that great before it ever hit the radio, and then radio just killed it. and then when the much better Thousand-Mile Wish came out, everyone said ""Oh, it sounds too much like One Thing"". this is one reason why i don't listen to the radio anymore.overall the album is decent. a lot of the harder songs on the album are too slow to get into (despite the very well-written lyrics of scott anderson), and the straight-ahead approach just doesn't seem to work for these guys. much like how the straight-ahead approach nearly killed the new nine inch nails record.another example of even the best of rock music getting worse. it's an alright buy, but greyest of blue skies and tip are the better buys.oh, and don't listen to the rainbow butt monkeys. just let that phase rot in it's grave where it belongs."
2,"SELL OUTS, COMPLETE SELL OUTS","This is sad hard to belive but sad you take a band wave some money in there face then wave a little more and you change there style and control the songs they write.This is called a sell-out. Its not cool but its whats going on now a days too bad because they were decent. Oh well theyre happy but im sure alot of fans arent, but they do have some new listners thanks to that sorry exuse for a song ( one thing ).You guys need some serious help."
2,I worry about incorrect information,"I think this book would appeal most to folks searching for a dog with little knowledge of the breeds themselves. I won this book and paid little attention to it for a long time. When I finally browsed through it, I was shocked to find that the breed information given about ""my"" breed (Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs) is almost 100% incorrect. The breed history is inaccurate, the breed standards are misstated and the personality traits are totally wrong. It seems like Mr. Dibra didn't even do cursory research on the breed before writing a summary about it. I'm not as familiar with many other breeds, but did find some glaring inaccuracies about others as well. Please research breeds through nationally accredited breed websites. If you want to research a breed or breeds, don't trust this book as an accurate source of information. I'm sure Mr. Dibra is an expert on dog training, but he obviously is no expert on breeds or types."
4,great manipulatives,"A fun manipulative, especially if you just can't 'see' the unfolded shapes in your mind. The manipulatives make simple geometry problems easier. I think it's great using these as toys with young children--using the correct terminology of the shapes while playing.The lids are a little flimsy--I worry about breaking the two tiny plastic tabs that keep the lids in place. The colored shapes are thinner than I thought they would be and only hold their shape while inside the hard case. The overheads were scratched--but I didn't want the hassle of returning them. The dark colors were easy to see, however the lighter colors were difficult to see; I'll have to go over them with a darker permanent marker.Overall, I like them and would buy them again."
5,FYI,For those that read the Wall Street Journal having to do with books that the top brass and politicians are reading about fighting guerrilla warfare might have found that this is no longer in print. It is however free at the Rand corp.'s website. here is the link: http://www.rand.org/pubs/reports/2005/R967.pdf
4,Son loves it!,"My 2.5 year old son loves this movie! It's not a full movie--it's 4 Thomas episodes with a story in between. The movie opens with an engine driver ""Perkins"" entering the Knapford Engine Drivers Common Room. Sir Topham Hatt calls and informs Perkins that he will be coming to inspect the station. Perkins begins cleaning the messy station in preparation for the inspection. This is the running story in between episodes (these mostly center around Perkins cleaning TOO quickly and making a bigger mess in his rush).Episodes:Thomas' Tall FriendPercy's New FriendsToby and BashBig BelleThese are all upbeat and cheerful episodes, so they are enjoyable to watch. I rated it 4 stars because I was expecting a full feature film and just the first episode had anything to do with the animals pictured on the cover. It was still a cute DVD and worth what I paid for it."
4,Thomas : The Curious Cargo,"The DVD od Thomas : Curious Cargo, arrived on time and in excellent condition. This will be a great addition to the collection of Thomas the Train Engine DVDs for my Grand Daughter, who is a big fan."
2,Genius or madman?,"You have to love this book.I know I do.My favorite parts are the fore-mentioned alien-attacks and the gang-wars that take over your city. The author suggests that the gangs will completely outnumber your police/army/navy/special-ops/national-guard completely and that you should find a safe place to hide while they over-run your city.I'm sure.He later suggests that you attempt to create an uprising by gathering munitions and what-not to do so, but BEFORE all that, try to gain money by selling food to the gangs that have infected the inside of your city limits...HUH?!?!And just so you know...there is NO way to survive completely after a nuclear-strike! Not unless you have building beneath the Earth, perfecting a culture that can survive without the sun or fresh water and been building it all underground for years just in case something like this happens!If any of THAT sounds insane, then you're game for this joke of a ""survival-guide"".--Matt"
2,Thought provoking but lacking any practical applicability,"While the book was thought provoking at times it quickly became very predictable in its senario approach. Forwarned is forarmed and preparedness is a good message, however, this book is virtually devoid of any useful how-to information. If you need help in thinking about possible disaster senarios this is the book for you. If you need practical knowledge in survival techniques and skills this isn't it."
1,Can you spell hurricane?,I would have more confidence in this advice if whoever put this on Amazon could spell hurricane. It takes so little time to spell check and it adds so much to credibility.
3,More of a what if book than a what to do type,"This book covers ""what if this happened?"" type senarios. After a while the senarios start to sound the same. The book is very light on how to prepair for the upcoming emergencies, he tells you what to do with out giving you addresses and information needed to get the material things you need to survive. This book needs to be paired with other physical survival books!"
5,7th Heaven Final Season,I bought this off of Amazon.com and Wow! I am so glad they came out with the final season. I enjoyed the family togetherness in this series where you don't have much of that anymore. For being a modern show the actors showed respect for one another which was clear in the beginning of the show. I wish they made a making of 7Th Heaven since most of the characters grew up on the show.
3,7th Heaven the final season.,"To be honest I have not watched this dvd, I bought earlier seasons of this show at a local book store and then bought some from Amazon. I wasn't really into watching this series on tv, but a friend of mine suggested I might like it so I bought it. I may watch it in the future but for now I don't really have anything to say about it."
5,Better then when on TV!,This season is just as good as all the other seasons. The disks were in great quality and I had no problem watching the episodes!
2,"Least favorite season, but still going to own it for completed collection","11th season was my least favorite season. Granted producer Aaron Spelling died between 10th & 11th seasons and Brenda Hampton didn't have a lot of ""meat"" to work with since a lot of the cast members were missing or came in late. But at the end of 10th season, the last words of the season, spoken by Sandy, said to Simon about her baby ""Simon, we need to talk."" And...they didn't elaborate on that statement, which left a lot of room for speculation that was never relieved. Then in season 11, we were left with a lot of cliff-hangers, such as Simon and his new girlfriend, Ruthie and T-Bone, Lucy and her pregnancy, Lucy and Kevin moving, etc. The season was a bit corny and childish at times. I rate it a 2 out of 10. However, I'm going to purchase it not because I love the season, but just to complete my collection."
2,7th Heaven: The Final Season,"I was totally disappointed in the way they ended the season. It was all about the father and his heart condition and how he will live. They also never acknowledged the actors and actresses from all the years that they were on. I have ALL of the dvd's and I guess I was expecting alot more of how the family would move on and not so much on just Dad. Very disappointed in the money I spent for a closing season sitcom.Respectfully,Lou Engelke"
5,Final Season 7th Heaven,I was 100% satisfied with the service that was received with the purchase of this final season of this TV series.
3,Missing Content (Broken Hearts and Promises),"In The November 5th Episode Broken Hearts and Promises Lucy (Beverley Mitchell) sings the song Angel. This song is not included on the DVD. I am so disappointed. This is the only reason I purchased the final season. I loved this show from the beginning, but the last season, for me wasn't their best season. I sang the song ""Angel"" at my Mother-In-Law's funeral a few months ago. It took me back to seeing this episode for the first time and Lucy dealing with the pending death of her father. I don't understand why this song was removed from the episode. You can hear the music start to play and then it cuts to the next day. Maybe it was an extra added for ratings, therefore wasn't actually part of the original script??? Great show, but if you were looking for this episode in its entirety, it is not there."
5,hurry please,ive watched all of the season of 7th heaven i need to watch this last one!its way to good this needs to be on tv again! PLEASE HURRY AND RELEASE IT ON DVD!
3,missing parts,Adjustment screw was missing is not worth the trouble to send back will just make small steel spacer to keep die handle from closing up the die when die is installed.
5,An excellent monograph,"A modern look at the most interesting lines of the Two Knights. I found the assessments of many variations are thoughtful and interesting. Playing through the variations and comparing one's own assessments with the authors' takes effort, but it's worth it in this case since there are many fascinating variations in the notes. Not for those who want to skip to the end of the chapter and have the authors tell them what to think. I liked this book a lot and would recommend it to anyone who likes thinking about the Two Knights (I certainly enjoyed it as much as Estrin's revered tome)."
1,Complete pablum.,"Beliavsky et al.'s book is one of the worst chess books I have ever seen. The book is so poorly laid out that it is difficult to follow the various variations and subvariations. Otherwise, it is bascially a dump of games and lines that have intrigued the authors, omitting many other lines, and possibilities. Don't expect to find scintilating commentary either because all the notes are in Informator-speak hieroglyphics. I have studied chess for over ten years and own over 50 chess books. This book is one of the worst. Just run a search on the Two Knights in ChessBase and save your money for a nice dinner or trip to the movies."
1,Not good!,A huge disappointment! Just a database dump of games! If you want to learn this opening find a used copy of Estrin's book and supplement it with the Informant and/or a database.
2,Becareful adding handsets!,"I bought the original base phone and a additional handset at Christmas from Circuit City. They worked great so I wanted to add an additional handset in March. The base phone would not recognize the new handset. Called Sony and three hours later I had NO PHONES!!! They had me do a few things and it erased all factory presets of the base phone. This can only be fixed at the factory. Long story short I now have to send all three phone back to Sony to have them reset. Of course Circuit City woundn't exchange them it had been 60 days since I bought the first phone and they make no exceptions. Also, my base phone was cordless and they don't sell that model anymore. I wonder why. Never reset the base even if a Sony rep tells you to do so. Will be a major catastrophe!"
2,"nice idea, but better not...","I just took this phone back to the store. I had two portable hand sets. After 1 week, the first refused to connect to the base. Exchanged it for a new one, however the replacement was useless: with the one originally registered but exchanged phone missing, the base refused to register the second phone. Sony help-desk said I should have 'unregistered' the first phone. Note however (1) the manual is explicit about the fact you can not unregister phones (2) how do I unregister a phone that doesn't want to communicate with the base in the first place? Sony adviced me that only solution was to take everything back to the store. So in effect, one part goes bad, the whole system needs to be replaced. Talk about poor design... Human factors on this thing are rather poor as well, e.g., there's no squeezing this one between your chin and shoulder without running the risk of pushing (disconnect) buttons. I was more than happy to get my money back."
2,It's pretty..,"What can I say? I like pretty shiny things.. add blue to this.. and I couldn't resist.I walked in to BJs one day.. and just HAD to have this. I really didn't need another cordless phone but it was just so so pretty. I get home set it up pretty quickly and register the handset with the base. 5 minutes go by the base is ringing I go to pick up the handset and nothing. It couldn't connect. That should have been a sign. In the few years I've had it it's only intermittently worked as advertised. Within in the last year caller id info will NEVER show up on any of the handsets and will only be displayed 1/50 times so if you like to know who is calling you, you'll simply be stuck with **RINGING**.I don't think they still make this phone. I believe Sony has completely abandoned their cordless phone line but if I am wrong.. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE."
3,sony spp-a2780 cordless phone,"This phone worked fine the first week I had it, but then i notice the corldess phone started to make a crackling sound when i was talking on it. The person on the other end also had a tendecy to fade in and out when talking often. The range of the cordless phone was great with little interference. The basse phone was great but the glass covering or plastic used for the caller id LCD could have used clearer material and lighting.Overall the phone was good but I belive i just recieved a defective one. I have returned it and will seek to get a replacement with another phone."
3,Very fast but bad product,"The cordles phone only work 1 month because when people call me or I do any call, they can't hear me. I don't know what happen."
2,"Good logic, terrible audio","The telephone's logic (ie. storing numbers, retrieving numbers, going through messages etc) is superb. No complaints. However it fails abysmally at simply being a telephone. Since telephones are all about hearing what someone is saying, it is very dissapointing to hear its poor audio quality. This problem is most prominent with respect to the speaker in the base unit. One uses this speaker when reviewing incoming messages and when using the speakerphone function. In these two uses, my phone's audio quality is so bad that it is irritating to use it. Many messages are difficult to hear and this is despite selecting the high sampling rate option for incoming messages.To make matters worse Sony is playing by the rule book when it comes to me trying to return the phone.I have no idea if I simply got a bad unit or if this is a bad design. The sour taste could have been lessened by user-friendly customer support. It was not."
3,don't go to circuit city,"saw the price for twenty dollars less at best buy advertisement. went to circuit city to buy it as best buy further away. got major run around by staff, usual denial of purchase protection/price guarantee by circuit city. just when it looked like things were going well----their computers crashed and i walked out to get food for kidss. you may asked why i have never really bought from circuit city---service stinks, major problems with stocking sale items, and the feeling that i am going to get ripped off"
3,Very out of date,"Most books and references mentioned are out of print or otherwise unavailable. His remarks about the southwest which preface each chapter are good, but there are too few of them."
4,It beats buying a new tire.,"I'm not even sure I used the product correctly - I had a slow leak in one of the tires on my golf TDI. The rate of the leak was roughly 1psi per day, as I found myself adding back 10psi every week and a half or so. Not wanting to bite the bullet and chuck a good tire, I semi-followed the instructions and added only 4 ounces of slime to the tire, and re-inflated. (The instructions said to use 8 ounces)It has now been a month or so, and I have yet to lose one psi from the tire. The products worked as described and sealed the leak.The only slightly negative aspect of using slime I've noticed thus far is a slight wobbling when first heading out to work in the mornings. Sometimes the wobble is there, sometimes not. It usually works itself out within 5 miles of driving.The product arrived on-time and appropriately packaged."
5,Good Stuff,I had a slow leak in my tire loosing about 10PSI a day I tried this stuff works great its very easy to use and not messy at all just follow the directions. Tip try only using half the amount the bottle says to use it will make the tire unbalanced and give you a slight wobble but after a certiant speed it goes away.
2,Didn't work,The stuff didn't work on my tractor tire. All it did was make a big mess to change the tire.
3,It's called Slime for a reason!,"The product worked on a lawn tractor tire that had a slow leak, however the mess is not wort the cost and time of replacing the inner tube, you can't clean the slime off your hands / fingers with and regular hand soap or hand cleaners."
1,simply didn't work,"i had a nail in a tire, and i followed the instructions, pulled the nail out, let the air go out, pulled out the core, poured in the whole 16oz of slime, and then refilled with air, and the whole remained. it's certainly not a 1/4"" hole - maybe half that. but air continued to pour out. i drove a bit to see if that would set the air in the hole somehow, but no go. didn't work, very unsatisfied."
1,green crap,don't buy this product. it is absolutely useless unless you are 5000 km from civilization.i put some in on of my front tires on my golf and if driven 40 mp hours or faster their is no real reason to hold on to the steering wheel because it shakes and vibrates so bad. i recommend that a tire shop repairs the tire instead. it will save you a lot of headache in the future.
3,Good introductory book to dream interpretation.,"This small book is a decent introduction to dreams and dream interpretation, particularly for those who want a more Christian slant as opposed to New Age. Kelsey pulls heavily from Carl Jung and the Bible to support his ideas. The only drawback was that it left me wanting him to expound more on the subject."
2,Did not meet up to my expectation,I was expecting more information in this book about dreams. I am no way closer to understanding dreams than I was prior to reading this book.
4,The only book about Jess and how it fits in various Java application scenarios,"Jess is a rules engine with excellent Java interplay. ""Jess in Action"" is a fast and swift read. Actually using Jess is surprisingly difficult.In ""Jess in Action"", you will read about the Jess syntax (facts and rules), how it interplays with Java (scripting Java from Jess, Java Beans as shadow facts, calling Jess from Java) and very extensive examples with very detailed backgrounds.All for version 61p4. The current Jess version is 71p2. As a bonus one can download from the books website a nonprofit version of Jess without a time limit. Unfortunately: Jess is not open source.If you want to do some Jess, ""Jess in Action"" is an excellent complement for the online documentation."
3,It`s Java compatible but not Java oriented but Lisp like syntax,"The subtitle is misleading. 20% percent of the code in the book is Java the other 80% is Lisp like syntax. I'm just a 10 years experimented Java, C++, VB, C# developer. So I'm too young to have seen Lisp! Because the book is always intermixing code and concepts instead of explaining the concepts at a higher level it's quite challenging. If you have problem to assimilate Lisp or Perl syntax Jess is not for you!"
3,slow warm up,"My office just got this machine. It faxes quickly, but only after it is warmed up. Warm up however is very slow, and if you try to fax anything while it is warming up, it gives you a ""job impossible' message. In addition, the number keys are rather poorly designed. There is no sound when they are pressed, and the are spaced far apart enough to be difficult to use. The number keys are also slanted. Whoever designed it must have been trying to be 'cute'. Those are my only complaints about the machine for now."
1,Hell's Bells #3,"Most soundscape recordings are of a time & place, an environment for listening based on local ambience. Steven Feld's three bell CDs are different -- each one is a series of sound effects recordings tied together by only one theme -- bells.There are church bells. There are herds of sheep wearing bells. There are bells on clothing. Ceremonial bells. Musical bells. Cow bells. Bells on trucks. Windchime bells. And not just short samples either, most of the recordings are 8-11 minutes.These are the kind of recordings a person into sampling might buy, or a person making a movie soundtrack. They're not even remotely usable as CDs you might listen to for enjoyment."
4,"crisp writing, economy of words, savvy literature","This was a Christmas present from my sister and I read it on New Year's Eve Day. I loved it. The writing reminds me of the light that shines in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Illuminating. Magical. Hard and Soft at the same time. There is humor mixed with danger mixed with social commentary mixed with surprise. A nice mix."
1,Lacks much creativity and makes you sick!!!,After reading this book I found out that even a interesting book can make you sick to your stomach.Descriptions were detailed and even though the book wasn't that boring the ending was just so useless and terrible that you wished you hadn't wasted your time in reading this book. I'm sorry but I dont recommend this book to anyone unless you like sick books.
4,Good but Minor Work from a Major Writer,"Eminent Peruvian novelist Llosa tries his hand at the crime story with this police procedural set in 1950s Peru. He doesn't stray too far from the tropes of the genre, as a crafty Guarda Civil Lieutenant and his sentimental Sergeant run afoul of powerful military types as they investigate the torture and murder of a young airman from a nearby Air Force base. Still, in this novella length story, he manages to produce a remarkable amount of character development with the two policeman, including an offbeat subplot about the Lieutenant's infatuation with a pudgy married cook. Unsurprisingly, as they slowly unfold the circumstances surrounding the young man's killing, issues of race, class, and corruption come to the fore. And, with such a buildup, it should come as no surprise that the resolution is more bitter than sweet. In sum, this is a relatively minor work from a major writer."
4,Good read,"This had some great character development in the book. I read it many years ago and it still stays with me: the descriptions, the people in the book, the character-flaws in each character. I am so glad to have read this book"
5,Great Sound!,"Using my new headphones for the first time today. They're pretty comfy to wear and sound fantastic. I'm hearing things in my music that I never noticed; good strong bass. Since I usually use my headphones at work hooked to my computer monitor, I actually find the length of the cord to be perfect. I can turn my head and even roll back to my file cabinet without yanking the headphones off."
2,These run small! Order at least 1/2 size larger!,"Nice looking boots - I got them in the mail yesterday. I wear size 11 1/2 for every other brand and can sometimes comfortably wear a size 11, but these are waaayyyyy too tight. I am going to need to send them back for a larger size. I am going to try a size 12, but am afraid that they'll still be a little small."
3,seconds?,what i concider excessive scratching on one of the boots. covered with polish they are hidden but that should not be necessary right out of the box. foot comfort is fine.
3,Rockport Could Do Better With This Boot,"This boot is just not up to my expectations of a Rockport product. The boots run narrow. The finish on the leather is some sort of oiled finish that turns light in the creases as you put them on and walk. The pull-strap at the back hangs up the cuffs of my slacks as I stand up, and I have to bend down to unhook them every time my cuffs ride up over the top of the boot, and the tabs are really to short to do any good---I'll probably end up cutting them off. The best things about the boots are their light weight, which one expects from Rockport, the soles stick to worn-smooth asphalt like glue, and the low dress heel. And, they are well-made. But, I would not buy them again."
2,Far From Her Best,"I love Suzanne Westenhoefer's humor, but I was embarrassed for her with this DVD. She rehashes material from ""Guaranteed Fresh"" (or perhaps that CD improved her delivery), but she seems to be straining and trying too hard. She doesn't connect with her audience in this DVD. There were occasional titters in the audience, but it was clear she didn't have them. Spend your time and money on other stuff she's done that's fresher and better--or get the ""Guaranteed Fresh"" CD."
3,Great archival footage. But the interviews...,"This DVD is worth the price for the archival footage of Jerry Herman's various shows. The home movies and TV footage are invaluable. The footage of Carol Channing performing Hello, Dolly at the White House is especially rich and priceless.But as for the documentary itself, it's unfortunately marred by interviews that are facile, and modern footage that is clearly staged and often awkward. The scene during which Jerry goes back to his childhood home is stilted and static. And the sequence in which Jerry works with Actor Jason Graae on a revival of The Grand Tour is painfully self-conscious.That said, there are some really moving aspects of the film as well, including the segment in which Jerry discusses the death of his long-time partner to AIDS and the fact that he himself is HIV-positive. But along the way, we have to experience quite a number of awkward moments and ham-handed film making."
4,"Great flexible sole, quick service, but stiching could be a bit stronger","The sole is really flexible in all directions, which is my top priority in toddler shoes, so I'm thrilled with this shoe in general. My only complaint is that the stiching is coming loose in various spots on both the red and brown shoes, but considering they were only $20 and kids feet grow so fast, they are still a great buy and I'm sure they will be outgrown before they fall apart. I'll probably buy more of this company's shoes when these no longer fit."
4,very flexible little shoes,"These are quite nice shoes for little feet. They are all leather which is hard to find at this price and are nice and wide. Very flexible and comfortable all around. You MUST order one size up which is why I'm giving them 4 stars and while they fit my daughter's average feet, they may not fit a ""chubby"" foot well. My daughter is a 4 and the 5 just fits her and probably not for that long. Still, a nicely made toddlers shoe."
3,nice shoe for a wider foot,"The shoe is soft annd I hope will be comfortable. I purchased size 21 for my granddaughter's 4.5"" foot but the the shoe is much to big and wide. The price was very good so I hope she grows into them."
5,Excellent toddler shoes!,"I purchased these when My daughter was 15 months and she is 19 months now. They still look brand NEW! We do have 2 other pairs of shoes that we rotate with, but she prefers these and the Luca and Livie shoes we have. They have held up wonderfully and we are ALWAYS getting compliments! I wish they went all the way up to a size 9 for future needs. But we are 100% happy!"
5,Excellent description on how leading companies develop leaders,"Well organized, ""Leading the Way"" describes how leading companies develop their leaders. In particular, I valued the analysis on Total Return to Shareholders (TRS) increase that the participation of CEOs on leadership development can have. Very useful in communicating why leadership development is important. Highly recommended."
5,EDGAR AWARD NOMINEE!!!!!,"""Forensics for Dummies"" has been nominated for an Edgar Award. This is no surprise as it is the very best reference published.This book will answer all of your questions and entertain you every step of the way!"
4,Great for students,This was a gift for a teen who is interested in studying forensics. In fact she reads all material she can find and is considering Forensics when she goes to the university. found the book an easy read & good start for studies. Here is the book perfered.
4,Forensics Primer,Great intro book to a fascinating specialty. Fun for CSI junkies like myself. A good read.
4,Really good!,"This book caught my eye in the library and I plan on buying a copy for my own shelves. It makes an excellent, basic reference book. But,I have many problems with the editing of this book, particularly toward the end (pages 246 and 254); unfortunately, that happens in many, many books: a lazy editor reads half or two-thirds of the work and thinks, this is pretty good, and then drops the entire matter. I have found, as an editor myself, that the second half of a book is usually of poorer quality than the first half. Nevertheless, as a reference, it is a great jumping-off point, if you are so inclined."
5,forensics for dummies,loved this book could not put it down one second.im about to re-read it just for the heck of it.its great if your learning or studying in the field.
4,Learning about Forensics,"This book is pact with information. A must for anyone wanting to know more about how Medical Examiners and other experts examine crime scenes and put together profiles, which help track down perpetrators. As I some day hope to become a writer of fiction. This book will certainly help me in my endeavours. Please note however, that this book is not for the squeamish or faint hearted."
4,Great teaching book - Great learning book,"If you are thinking of going into any of the forensic fields, this would be a great starting point.If you are in law enforcement on a smaller force, this would be a definite helpful read.If you enjoy crime shows and books, this will help you learn the truth behind the science and effort.Written to be readable on any level. You can skip over any part or any section if you wish and still fully enjoy.You will not be a Forensic Dummy when you complete this book.I highly recommend if you have any interest level in forensics."
3,Basic,It is a little basic but does clear up some issues with TV forensics. But definitely a good starting place.
2,It's not Cordura Nylon,"This duffle bag listed is not made from cordura nylon. It's a Rothco cotton canvas duffle bag, measuring 22"" by 38"". By no means is the actual bag substandard, it is what it is. An Indian made cotton duffle bag, sold by other competitors for approximately the same price and can be bought from Amazon with free shipping.If your're looking for a cordura nylon duffle bag, research and contact the vendor, before you purchase."
3,Libertad es eterna,"This is a typical Libertad Lamarque film: a middle-aged mother confronts problems of the world. The theme of racial prejudice is the center of the action. Libertad Lamarque does her usual competent job of bringing her character, Laura Garcés, to life. There is lots of melodrama, one well sung tango by Libertad and an ending that teaches a good lesson. It is a dated film but one that I like to watch."
5,"White Christmas, by Leroy Anderson","I loved it. I heard one of the songs on satellite TV and it was one of my favorite songs, so I looked it up and found it on Amazon."
5,AWESOME READ!!!!,"This book came along at the perfect time, This is the best book about living the Wiccan life everyday that has been written!!!I recommend it to everyone that has been on the path and is beyond the Wicca 101 type books.Thanks Sylvan for the awesome book, keep them coming!!Blessed Be)0("
2,Not much to say,"I had high hopes for this book. Do only were the reviews glowing but the first few pages, which I read using ""look inside this book"", were beautiful. In fact so is the rest of the book. Sylvan is a gifted writer, and her style is the reason for the two stars I did give this book. Unfornately, the wonderfully written words fail to express anything of substance. Sylvan says over and over that Wicca is about daily practice and not monthly festivals, and that is essentially it. On how to incorporate Wicca into your daily life Sylvan basicly says to love all and live in balance. As if this was new advice. The book is also pitifully short - it would probably only take up 50 pages of regular sized paper.Besides the writing itself, this book does have one saving grace. The book of moonlight. If you thought Sylvan's prose was good, wait til you see her poetry. Though she only gives us a few tidbits to work with, they are treasures."
5,Witchcraft EVERY MOMENT,"This is a WONDERFUL book. I had the pleasure of meeting Dianne at the International New Age Trade Show in Denver this year; she gave me a very confirming runic reading, and we talked about the importance of living Craft every moment. This book is not geared at ritualism and ceremony, which are a priceless part of the Craft, but rather living the Path EVERY MOMENT; that is, in extreme spiritual Awareness, not just reserving such perception for ritualism alone. This book is about the important truth of Craft not being separate from every breath, movement and action. This is essential to anyone who is coming to understand that the Craft = a living path rather than a hobby :)"
3,Nicely written book,I liked this book. It wasn't terribly more advanced as I thought or hoped it might be. But I did enjoy reading it. Had some good thoughtful questions at the end of each section.
5,A must have for any pagan library.,Packed with tons of history and lore this book will give you a wider view of the pagan religious aspects. A must have for anyone who wants to get more detail on the religious side of Wicca or witchcraft. This book explains the spiritual background and lets you discover within yourself your own religion and personal prayers and rituals.
4,Works great.,This carrier worked really well with our infant. She did not like it (or any other other carrier) at first and then loved it after the first month. The carrier is easily adjusted between my husband and myself. I heard some carriers are hard to get on and off and some times a two person event. This one does not require two people. We have taken multiple hour long hikes with our baby in this and she was comfortable enough to sleep in it.
1,Just Aweful - Hard to Use,"Don't understand what the hipe is all about. We got one thinking it was the best thing since sliced bread - due to all the positive reviews - and was very disappointed. It was extremely hard to get our baby in and out of it. Her legs kept getting stuck. It took two people to use. Getting a child in and out alone was next to impossible. Also seemed like it was squishing the baby. Poor thing couldn't move arms or legs while inside. As an infant, her head was pinned to your chest. We immediately returned this overpriced item for a sling - which was great!"
2,A great quality but a little too tight....=(,"I bought this carrier when my baby was already 4-5 months. I thought that it would give me some help on doing stuff while my daughter is in it. Unfortunately I found that it was pressing her too tightly towards me, and it didn't make her very comfortable. I figured that maybe she is already too old for it.As far as I can judge, I read the instructions and made it as wide as I could. Can't say anything, it was easy to get her in and out, but I still couldn't use it. I maybe used it 3 times after all.Overall , not an item I could live without for the price it cost me....=("
5,MUST HAVE!!,This is a definite must have! My three month old loves to be snuggled in this carrier. It is especially helpful when we go shopping and go to church. He falls asleep every time he goes in it! It is definitely worth the extra money!
5,Worth the $,Definitly a good product. Both my husband and I are comfortable using this is carry our three month old around. MUCH easier than carrying him in the car seat/carrier. I use it around the house--he loves to look around since we started carrying forward in it. It doesn't take long before he fall asleep even when he is fussy.
4,Working Out Well for Us,"My husband and I have been happy with the Bjorn. It fits both of us well and our baby enjoys being in it. The first few times we tried it our baby was sort of upset with the change of hold, so if you experience this keep trying it for short periods of time and your baby will start to realize its a fun way to stay close to mom or dad. Sometimes our little one can be comforted to sleep in this carrier. I use it for cozy walks around the house, short walks outside, and for short shopping trips. The Bjorn is pricey compared to similar products, and I did buy a cheaper version to compare and it just wasn't as comfortable so I decided to stick with the Bjorn."
4,Not for Chubby Babies,I got this carrier before my baby was born. It was great when he was a newborn...I used it often to get him to go to sleep. But now being a rather chubby 3 month old (17 pounds) the carrier is getting too tight for him girth wise. I wish there was a way to adjust the girth as well as the length.
2,to tight around the baby,"We got the baby bjorn as a gift and i am glad we did not spent the money on it, sofar it did not live up to our expectations, my wife was able to use it in the begining, but only once, our baby did not like being in there i am not a big guy but the baby felt really tight in there, and as soon i tried to put her in the baby bjorn she was screaming, because she felt it was to tight, we even adjusted the bb as if our baby would be bigger did not help, not to sure what kind a babys they used to messure it but i thing the messurments are off.any how my recomendation if want to buy see if you can test it first with your baby and see if it works it definatly does not work for us"
5,Sturdy and comfy for all,"I love this carrier! I received it as a gift from my brother who was visiting Sweden (where they are made) after he noticed how EVERYONE in Europe was using them...and it is truly wonderful! Sturdy, attractive, easy to use and adjust, and comfy for both the baby and me-it is a must if your little one is somewhat fussy for a certain period each day-I've been able to avert such times by placing him in the carrier before the fussy time hit and going about my business-doing housework (esp. vacuuming), walking, just about anything! Definite must and better (IMHO) than all others on the market!"
5,The best carrier!,"The Bjorn is a little more expensive, but worth it! This carrier works for newborns up to 33lbs. I found that the less expensive carriers didn't fit as our baby got bigger. The Bjorn is very adjustable as your baby grows. It is comfortable for the adult wearer also. Our baby still fits in it at 8 months. I wish we had it when she was a newborn."
5,Best Infant Carrier,"We are extremely excited about our Baby Bjourn carrier. We had tried several others and were ready to give up on the idea due to frustration. However, the baby Bjourn carrier is so simple to use and our daughter loves it. It goes on and off with ease, even while she is sleeping. The only down side to this carrier is that the straps are made for medium build or large build adults. We have had to purchase large straps for my husband because he is quite a bit taller than I am. This can get pricey, but trust me it is worth the extra dollars to invest in this great carrier. If you are looking for an infant carrier, this is the best!"
3,A good product if you use it...,I heard rave reviews about this product so I had to have one. My son needed to snuggle all the time and I had a poorly made cheaper model. Since my daughter was born I have used it one time while at a historial park. It's a great product but make sure you have a need for it and want to invest the money.
1,not as good as a sling!,"I tried this and other front type carriers with my 3 children and I still like a sling better, it is really versatile, and gets years of usage. My 2 year old is still worn in the sling, comfortably on my hip. The kind of sling I lke best is a SlingEzee, I bought mine from Parenting Concepts. My newborn loves it, I sheild her from the elements, and I someimes use it as a clean and comfy place to change her diaper."
2,I Like some Carrier's,"I Like the Carriers that give the head support. When the baby falls asleep he/or she will have some kind of head & neck support. So you would want to look for a carrier with that High back, neck & head support. I used one for all 3 of my kids."
3,It's not as easy as it looks!,"I, too, listened to all the reviews. I also saw about a million people, men and women, carrying their precious cargo in a Baby Bjorn. A good friend bought me the Bjorn becasue it was on my registry. My son was a big guy so I used this costly item maybe 5 times. It is good to use when you are getting on and off a bus or subway and you can't tote a stroller. But as far as going about your day with baby in the Bjorn, your back may ache within the first half hour! The bottom line: if you have a small, lightweight baby, this product is for you. It's a very good product, but time is fleeting and you may only be able to use it for a couple of months."
4,Well-rounded look at a classic,The Bedford edition of this classic novel contains more than the typical Charles Dickens tale. In addition to the text are five excellent essays on this novel. Often Great Expectations is taught in a mundane and archaic manner. This edition allows both the student and teacher to approach the text from several twentieth century schools of thought. Peter Brooks in particular offers an excellent psychonanalytic interpretation. This text is a welcome addition to any classroom.
2,"The book was complicated and ""over-written"".","The book Great Expectations was a book that was over-written. Even though the author Charles Dickens was writing according to his time, it was confusing and complicated. I didn't like the book at all."
1,It was horrible,The story of a boy named Pip and his rise to become a gentle man is a horrible story that Charles Dickens wrote just so he could make a few lousy bucks.
1,this book is incredibly boring...save your money,I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE. I THINK THAT EVERY COPY SHOULD BE BURNED AND NEVER READ AGAIN. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WAST TIME AND MONEY DON'T BUY THIS BOOK.
2,Too few spies,"For those with a legal bent, this book makes interesting reading. I don't have such a bent and therefore found it rather hard going in places. The cases are interesting, but not nearly enough are about spies, which is why I bought it. Quite a lot of legal detail, with its specialised reasoning, makes it hard for the general, casual reader like me, though a barrister friend's eyes lit up at the sight of it, and the author's name. It would make a good gift for the lawyer in your life."
4,Great sound... Great Price .... MINI PLUG LINE IN,I just bought this stereo and I believe it is a great deal for such a low price. The front in-line jack lets you connect any device you want... Great sound ... highly recommended.Previous sony models included the hard case for the dettachable face... this one did not...Too bad
2,[Bad] User Interface for MP3,"This item has the worst user interface for mp3 files that I've ever seen. It does work as advertised, hence the two stars, but the search function rarely works and the buttons are confusing at best. Avoid."
2,OK for the price,"(...). I wasn't expecting it to be perfect and it's not. It won't play all MP3 files. I seem to have the most trouble with VBR encoded files but I've also seen some CBR files that won't play. Some of the controls on the player don't always work as advrtised. For example skipping folders works sometimes but not always. It seems like they rushed this one to market a little soon. But if you do a little testing with the unit up front and you're careful with how you encode your files, it's ok for the price I guess."
2,Too Angst Oriented,"As an adopted person and a full-time stepmom, I found this book to focus way too much on the negative and on angst. I certainly had my share of issues as a teen, but I really don't think they are all traced back to my adoption and the six months I spent in a home prior to being placed in a family. Also, even though I am in contact with my biological family, my adoptive parents are my parents. That is how all involved think of the situation. In naming a book about adoption, I would never think to use the term adoptive parents. In fact, I had never considered the term before recently doing research for an assigned class topic in grad school. There is a sever lack of positive and empowering books about adoption, particularly for teens, and this book does not fulfill that need either, much to my disappointment. When my daughter begins questioning what the situation is with her Mom and discussing whether I will adopt her, I really want one for her to read!"
4,a must read for adoptive parents and anyone trying to help them,I'm a therapist and a waiting adoptive parent. I found this book very useful for my work with patients (adoptive parents and adopted kids) and my own process. My only criticism is that the author's religious beliefs sometimes seem to pop up. They are not woven into the work and seem awkward and forced and are not really helpful for folks who don't share her spiritual beliefs leaving some of the advice hollow. This is not to say tht this is not a nescessary read for all adoptive parents and professionals working with adoptive families regardless of religious or spiritual beliefs. The info in the book is invaluable.
5,Twenty Things Adopted Kids Wish Their Adoptive Parents Knew,"Excellent book, I believe it should be read by anyone considering to be a foster parent as well as an adoptive parent. Excellent book as well for Foster Care Case Workers, and Social Workers."
1,This book shows adoptees as victims!,"As an adult adoptee and now mother of an adopted son, this book made me mad! This book talks about grief, grief, and more grief. Adoption should be talked about openly and honestly and seen as an incredibly positive thing for everyone. Sure questions about identity will arise but adoptive parents must emphasize that the child is just as much a part of the family as any other child. This book makes an adoptee feel like he or she is the bad seed or that the parents are struggling with them."
3,What We All Have in Common,"The book raises some very interesting ideas of how an adoptive child feels, even if the child was adopted at birth. However, some of the issues seemed parallel to many people growing up and trying to find their special place in the world. It made me stop and think, ""maybe some of these issues are not related to these people/children because of adoption, but because it is a growing process for us all"". Adoptees do have issues, however I feel that a lot of the issues presented in the book are common to us all."
5,good for anyone who needs to understand this child/adult....,i (birthmother) got this book to understand what my daughter needed from the time of inutero and on..and didn't get because of the lack of understanding prevalent in the adoption arena around the 1960's...i feel everyone in the adoption triad needs to read this insightful..realistic info....even the now adoptive adult who may not (and i emphasize..'may not') understand what they needed and still need now..as adults..that they weren't able to get from their birth/adoptive parents in the past...it will help them to 'parent' themselves..so to speak...because..we all have 'unfinished' parenting that we still need in order to keep growing up as healthy and happy adults who can have open..honest and meaningful relationships with others...and i know from having a close relationship with my own daughter since march of 2001..that adoptive children/adults have special needs in this area which..i feel..are made very clear in this book.....!
2,"Good, As Far As It Goes","Eldridge's book was fine as far as it went. As a prospective adoptive parent, I sure would have liked to have more balance in the book. Not all of my adopted friends experienced the extremes Eldgridge points to here. This book is a good starting place for those interested in adopting a baby, but not for anyone looking to adopt an older child."
5,Must read for all adoptive parents,Each chapter of this book hits a home run! Sherrie clearly describes many of the hidden thoughts and emotions that adoptees feel but have difficulty expressing. I only wish it had been put in the hands of my own adoptive parents.
2,Potential Adoptive Parent,"I agree with some of the earlier writers. I read this book in preparation for adoptive parenting. It scared me to death! I appreciate the comments of an earlier reviewer who is also adopted. I also had to think of the people I know who are adopted and turned out fine. Their are children who live with their birth parents with similiar issues. I appreciate the honesty, but it is one woman's story. I am going to stick to the parenting books."
4,Yes it is a bit scary but...,"I understand that the writer is explaining things from her own perspective and she clearly explains that some of the issues mentioned in her book may or may not apply to every case.As a newly adoptive mom I liked the book because it tells you the many many things that you could do wrong and it prepares you for what could be the worst case scenario. I agree that probably many kids or parents would not face all these problems but even if only one appears, then the bookd would be helpful.The one thing I do not like about the book is that it was written thinking only in adoptions in the US, for example in my country there is no such thing as open adoption, all adoptions are closed adoptions.But in overall I liked the book because it showed me things I had never thought of."
1,Worst Adoption Book I've Read,I am flabbergasted that there are this many positive reviews. This book was awful; I couldn't even finish it. The author is overly dramatic and takes maternal psychoanalysis to an extreme. Let me save you some time with this tidbit. She has a conversation with the adopted son - who is now 7 years old - and asks him how painful his surrender was. He was THREE days old but tells her it WAS painful and he felt alone and unloved. Poppycock! I feel sorry for this boy that must be reminded every day that he survived what this woman sees as a tragic event.
4,Good book buy,The book was exactly what I expected. In the exact condition as expect. Would definately buy from this seller again.
1,"if you want to feel inadequate, this is the book for you","I am an adoptive parent. I cannot speak to the experience of being adopted however I can tell you this: adoptive parents need encouragement and support not a book that communicates to them, between the lines and more blatantly (forgive me; I muddled through this book 10 years ago), that they are inadequate to the task of making their adopted child feel loved and accepted. A terrible, horrible book. I don't 'hate' because I feel it is a waste of energy but I do intensely dislike this book and I think it does a disservice to well-meaning adoptive parents who really, truly want what is best for their adopted child. Instead of memorializing loss, celebrate connection -- it's better for the whole family. Thanks for listening."
1,Disappointing,"As an adoptive mother, I was excited to read this book. But my excitement quickly turned to disappointment. Why? Because:The most enlightening parts of the book came when the author was quoting other authors.I felt like the information was so dated. Are there hoards of adoptive parents who ignore that grief is a part of adoption? Most adoption professionals and parents stress openness now.Very lop-sided.If you are looking for a good read, please try Parenting Your Internationally Adopted Child by Patty Cogen or Raising Adopted Children by Lois Melina."
3,bacon smelling book,"ok ive been ordering books from amazon for so long i could have profit sharing from the company! ( in fact i just bought a kindle fire ) and since i have a sense of humor and i know im not alone... WHEN I FIRST STARTED READING THIS BOOK, I SMELLED BACON! first on my hands, then i smelled the book, BACON! .... I know this belongs in a pile of sellers reviews...but i just had to share!! by the way i was adopted 44 years ago, my son and his wife adopted my grandaughters ( sisters ) now age 6 and 7. i flipped thru this book and i can see it touchs on some issues that i wanted to work out with my girls. communication ( and the knowledge how to use it ) and love, and patience are key, this book seems to enlighten the parent and give them a simple guide to go by."
1,Negative and unrealistic,"This author suffers from emotional issues/depression that I believe she would have had whether she was adopted or not. Everyone has had issues in their life that can cause emotional problems, adopted or not, but you can't just focus on the ""hole in the middle of you."" If you do that, you are destined to feel sad and depressed. Plenty of adoptees are happy, healthy adults. Her approach is negative and disheartening. If you interested in healing emotional wounds from adoption, try Deborah Gray."
2,"Skip this one, there are better books out there!","I read this book (and many others) in the early stages of adopting our son. This book took every ounce of joy from the process. So many negative comments and connotations. This is the last book I would recommend to someone going through an adoption. The author clearly has issues pertaining to her adoption and is trying to push them off on those who became parents via adoption. Rather than inflict the negativity of this book upon yourself, choose a different book!"
1,Neo-Traditionalist Diatribe,"Under the false pretnse of laid out in the title, Sherrie Eldridge lays out what is essentially an endorsement of Traditional family values and discpline, but perversley advocates for it from the child's perspective. Things include ""My country of origin outlaws abortion because the holy father says its wrong"", ""Mommy, Daddy, if I missbehave use the bamboo rod"", and ""If I'm caught writing with my left hand, please hit it with a ruler"". This book comes off as being very 1950s in its beliefs and In my opinion could lead to harm upon the child, especially if they are from Cambodia or Laos or Vietnam or Ukraine and are born bakwards."
3,Kris -- Reader from Ohio,"As a prospective adoptive parent AND adoptee, I found this book to be helpful in emphasizing some of the communication issues in adoption. This book emphasizes regret and loss on the part of the adoptee -- feelings that as an adoptee, I do not feel strongly about. I believe reading this book as an adoptive parent may give good insight into concerns and feelings, but as an ADOPTEE, I want prospective parents to know that my experience has been positive and happy -- therefore do not let this book discourage you. I found some interesting parallels to my life in this book, including hating birthdays and some of my actions growing up. I believe adoption can be more positive than the portrait the author paints. Readers can, however, use some of the communication suggestions the author makes."
2,felt mislead,"I am adopting from Africa and was so excited to get this book. Then I read a few chapters and felt mislead. I thought that this would be information that adopted children would want their parents to know, but I felt that there were not 20 questions, but one theme and 20 ways to state it. I also felt that the author was very depressing about adoption that in some way these children are damaged far above all other kids and won't ever get over it without intense therapy. I will admit that I didn't finish it, and probably won't."
2,Adopt a Mom,"I felt the book was a great set up to screw up your adopted child. I also felt that the author has deeply embedded issues that she needs to deal with. I do agree that their is a grieving process though. I also agree that infants do sense more then we give them credit for. I felt the book was very defeating for adoptive parents. I want what is best for my child and I felt that this book would not be for us or for my child. I am sorry her parents are dead. They did the best that they could in raising the author. No upbringing is ideal but it may be better then being brought up in an abusive home (like I was). Maybe she should thank the people who do adopt because their is alot of ""anti-adoptism"" out there. My child would have been in an emotionally neglectful household and be brushed aside had she stayed with the birth mom. Adoption is a special event and not an event that is suppose to scar someone for life."
2,Twenty Things Adopted Kids Wish Their Adoptive Parents Knew,"If you have not adopted kids before, this book might scare you and keep you from it. It is written from such a negative point of view. If you can take out the negativity and keep the other stuff, it'd be okay. The author definitely lets her pain show through her book and it gets in the way of the point she tries to make. She just takes it a little too far."
3,good and bad,"I believe reading this book gave me a valuable insight into the concerns and feelings of adoptees, but I think this book was flawed in that the writer's view of how she was raised got in the way of some of the messages. There was one passage, the writers states that her parents should have acted a certain way and even gave an example of what they should have said. I remember saying to my self ""who talks this way?"" Because of her upbringing, it tainted the book with negativity. HOWEVER, as a hopefully soon parent to an adopted child, I did find the book valuable in recognizing the problems and issues that do come up."
3,Not very helpful.,I was very discouraged by this book. I didn't even finish reading it because I was frustrated. The book talks a lot about how kids can feel but doesn't talk about what to do to help your child.
4,Helpful Insight,"I thought this book provided good insight into what adopted children may be thinking and feeling. Some of the other reviewers have criticized this book for portraying only the negative side of adoption. I don't think that's what Ms. Eldridge does. I think she gives honest insight as to what kids might be feeling, gives adoptive parents suggestions on how to speak with their children to see if their issue is adoption-related, then follows it with suggestions for how to deal with the issue if there is one. Will all adopted children feel the way she describes? Probably not... some kids are more sensitive, others are more resilient. But some will... and this book gives help to the parents of those children. Reading this book isn't for the faint of heart, but I believe it can provide helpful insight to adoptive parents."
3,Good book but to religious for my taste.,I am all for having people believe what they want but sometimes I think they go a little to far. For a great healing book on adoption I recommened Whose Child? by Kasey Hamner.
1,"Depressing, Redundant, Read","I found this book to be very redundant and depressing. If I were to summarize this book, I would say that it basically emphasized how all adopted kids experience suffering, loss, are inclined to have issues. The author recommends for parents to acknowledge this suffering by trying to identify with the child and saying things like, ""You must be sad that you weren't born in mommy's tummy."" I could not identify with a lot of the advise provided in this book.I anticipated that this book would address multiple issues surrounding adoption. Instead, I got more of the same thing. Every chapter, more suffering and sadness. Although I have read up to page 120, I don't think I can muster up the effort to read the few chapters that are left.If you like to feel sad this is a must read! This book may make you want to run away from adoption."
1,For all the reasons not to adopt ....,"If you want be discouraged and feel bad about your decision to love a child not born of your body then read this book!This woman definitely had a chip in her shoulder and carried a grudge for all mommy and daddy didn't do for her. NO ONE I have talked to adoptive parent or adoptee agreed with anything she wrote especially with regards to the ""primal abandonment"" theory.Only read it if you HAVE too!"
2,One sided,I felt that this book was one sided. It felt negative and talked down to the reader. I do not believe that ALL adopted children are as depressed as this book my want you to believe. I know adopted people and have talked to them and they had a different and more positive experience.
1,Waste of Time,"As an adoptee, I can attest that this book was nothing less than rubbish. Yes, adoptees have issues to deal with that others do not, but the author greatly exaggerates and distorts these problems, and gives contrary and condescending advice. As she consistently attributes every problem she has to being adopted, it is apparent that she has her own issues to overcome before giving advice to others. Further, this book reads like a poorly developed high school term paper, whose sources come from a newsletter authored by Ms. Eldridge herself and very few meaningful experts. Don't waste your money."
1,Why Bother To Adopt??,"As a mother of four adopted children, I found this book to be very disturbing. It came across as one woman's way of venting her anger and frustration of being adopted. She felt she was deceived and had never forgiven her parents, both adoptive and natural. (She says she was never really told she was adopted, she just found out)I know many adults that were adopted as children and not one of them has ever expressed any feelings of having a ""primal wound"".Like I said above, the author seemed very angry. She has her opinion that her ""adopted status"" was the cause of all her probems. I tend to disagree, look inside woman! Not all problems are someone else's fault!"
1,"waste of time, Not balanced at all - lack of substance","I have to agree with another reviewer. There are far better references/books out there than this one. It seems the author came up with a catchy title and wrote a book around it. But all ""twenty things"" can be really categorized into one thing - dealing with grief. Dealing with grief is very important, yes. but I don't believe that should be the only thing discussed with your adopted child. I feel this book is totally Unbalanced and paints a distorted picture of what an everday life is like for an adopted family. waste of time!"
2,"Ok information, But not an essential buy","While this book does touch on some items that might be of interest to some, I as an adult adoptee found that some of what was said to be true for all kids,not just adopted ones. I think the book would have been better if Ms. Eldridge would have picked and written about only 10 things and then included helpful advice or information from the remaining items. I believe it also bordered on the edge of being a social platform. I would not recommend this book if it is the only one you are going to read. IF you are trying to get an over all insight and don't mind having to wade through some additional child behavior theory to get it, then this is the one for you."
1,Psychobabble,"Someone asks their child what they remembered of their adoption at a few days old and he says ""I was scared...I didn't know anyone's name"". A child is torn from the sheltering environment of her mother's womb and not comforted by that mother and this leaves a sense of loss forever. Huh? If all that's true then why are so many adoptions so successful? The point the communication, honest communication, is important... but the unending emptiness faced by the adoptees in this book seems to be the exception, not the rule. After reading most of it and skimming the rest, this went in the trash."
2,Does NOT seem to apply to teen adoptions,"As the father of 3 open adoption teens and a 4th adoption about to be finalized, I find this book could possibly be discouraging to new adoptive families. Perhaps some of the issues the author deals with apply more to younger children, but none of my sons after reading through this book with me have much good to say about it. The part about birthdays in particular do not seem to ring true with the older children and it appears that the author still has serious issues of her own at the adult stage."
1,The first book I have ever thrown away!,what an awful book. I read this because it was recommended by our social worker. I am the adoptive mother of a 5 year old. If I had read this when we first started to think about adoption it would have scared me to death. This book is mainly the authors opinion and sad story. There are millions of happy well adjusted adoptees in the world. THIS BOOK IS SCARY AND UNTRUE. If I could give it 0 stars I would. There are many wonderful books about the adoption experience. Do NOT READ THIS ONE!
5,Great for anyone involved with adoption!,"Sherrie's book is an outstanding resource for adoptive parents, adoptees, and adoption professionals. After a wonderful introduction, the author explores the ""twenty things"" each in their own chapter and with very practical ways to start conversations with your adopted kids about the issues they face. The author also includes lists of recommended reading, online resources, national support organizations, support groups, and her own website and newsletter. It's been my experience as a foster parent, adoptive parent and child professional, that many books require you to wade through extensive theory and psychiatric observation to find your own way. Many do not get to the ""guts"" in a practical manner which is very important for today's busy families. I recommend it to all teenage and adult children of adoption as well as teachers, and anyone who works with children."
1,My heart aches...,"... when I read books like this one. Please read all the negative reviews on this book before you consider reading the book itself. Truth and Grace are much better answers than all the ""primal wound"" things this author addresses. I'm not saying we go into total denial of the unique needs that an adopted child MAY experience. What I am saying is that we need to get God's perspective on the adpoted child rather than continually focussing on all the negative stuff.""A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows,is God in his holy dwelling. God sets the lonely in families...""(Ps 68:5-6 NIV)"
2,"I agree--it's a ""whinefest""","As an adoptive mother, I was interested in getting information that might help me deal with possible issues as my son grew older. The title of this book suggests that the author consulted many adoptees with many different experiences.Unfortunately, it appears that most of her ""case studies"" support her theory that, like herself, all adoptees are sad victims. I found this book to be more a cathartic journal for the author as she deals with her own feelings of loss and sadness.Don't bother with this book unless you want to feel guilty about adopting your child."
1,Are there any postitive aspects???,"This book just focused on all the negative aspects of adoption. As adoptive parents we already know our children will have some hard issues that need to be resolved. But where's the positive aspects of raising adopted children?? There was no practical everyday advice. After reading this book I thought I made the biggest mistake of my life, what was I thinking when I adopted my daughter? After speaking with my adoption agency and attending some support groups I threw the book out. I would never recommend this to anyone!!!! I think the author still has issue of her own to work through before she starts handing out advice."
1,Psychobabble,"I am sure there is some merit to the author's claim that adoptees feel some kind of loss at times in their life, but this book makes such a blanket statement about how damaged adoptees turn out, that it's impossible to take seriously. She comes off as some kind of zealot and the opinions expressed in this book were downright offensive at times."
1,NOT WHAT YOU THING YOU ARE ORDERING!!!,I was looking for a photo of Dale Jarrett to frame for my husband as a Christmas gift. This is an album NOT A PHOTO....there are NO PHOTOS! DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO WITH IT NOW! FAULTS advertisement......ALWAYS READ CAREFUL!! Items are not what you think they are!
1,I will never buy a sony phone again!,"I was attracted to this phone by the aesthetics and the features it offered...little did I know that shortly after I bought it the #3 button would stop working. The worst part is that Sony customer service was pathetic. Their solution was to send the phone back which would leave me ""phoneless"" for 2.5 weeks. Or so they hoped as the customer service rep told me - no guarantee it wouldn't take longer than that. When I asked for a supervisor of the customer service manager I was told that ""no one else would want to bother talking to me about this problem"". Last phone/product I ever buy from them. Whatever happened to the customer is always right?"
2,"Nice look, nice problems.",This phone is good. But what's the point of having a phone where the #1 button stops working. The first phone I sent it back for an exchange and guess what happens? The new phone's #1 button just messed up again. It hasn't even been 2 months. Sony needs to fix this problem.
1,This is the worst phone ever!,"I bought this phone November, 2001. About a week after purchasing it, the number 1 button stopped working. I exchanged the phone for a new one. With the replacement phone, everything worked for a while. Now, I am looking for a new phone since the number 1 and 2 buttons do not work. Most of the phone numbers for people I call regularly are stored in memory so I do not frequently use the number pad for dialing. This phone was the biggest waste of money. Do not purchase it!"
1,Not Recommended,"I have the same review listed under ""Phlat Ball XT Fabric Cover"". I felt that since it is also a ""Time Delay"" that it belongs here as well.I have an 8 year old son. He was so excited when I told him he could buy one of these at our local store. It cost him $12.00 with tax. That is a month's worth of allowances for him. He was so disappointed when it wouldn't change from flat to a ball.His older brother (20 years old) and older sister (16 years old) helped him. They read the instructions. It wouldn't work. It would only change to a ball if it hit the ground. The package says ""Throw a disc ... catch a ball!"" It also says ""Pops into a ball at random!"" The ""at random"" part is the thing you have to worry about. It also says ""Time-Delay performance may be affected in wet, sandy, or dusty conditions."" We weren't in those conditions. It isn't reliable. It just isn't fun.I just wanted to help anyone who is considering getting one of these for their child."
2,Not that fun,The product works as advertised but it is neither a good ball nor a good frisbee so after the novelty of going from flat to ball wore off the kids stopped playing with it. Maybe the dog will like it.
2,Dull disengaged preaching,"The book is much weaker than Lynch's classical piece ""The Image of the City"". Text sometimes gets dull and too dry, like in many of reference books. In fact, the ""referential"" quality of ""Site Planning"" is the only positive feature of the book. When authors pursue the singular goal to create a comprehensive textbook, the liveness of arguments suffers a lot. The book becomes rather a dull close-minded disengaged preaching that requires a lot of effort on the side of a reader to understand and utilize it."
2,SteamFast Steam Mop/Steamer,"I was not that impressed with this mop. I purchased it as it was given the ""Good Housekeeping"" seal of approval. It did OK cleaning bare floors, but found it of little value to use the handheld steamer on other surfaces like the shower. The handheld steamer never seemed to get hot enough to cut through the grime. Also, the handle on the top part of the mop is very flimsy."
4,GREAT!,"I haven't had the chance to use it too much yet, since it was a Christmas gift, but I used the steamer (without the mop) in the bathroom and was amazed at what it ""blew"" out from under the toilet! EWW! It did a great job!!! It's a little tedious, getting small areas at a time, but it really does work."
1,Disappointing,"Got it two days ago, tried it yesterday, boxed it earlier today and I'm sending it back tomorrow. Not worth it at all! Extremely poor quality overall. Do not recommend!"
2,Make sure you your receipt!,"I was very disappointed by the shark steamer mop. It wouldn't take out the simplest of spots. I used it on a wood floor, and it ended up looking dehydrated. My regular mop with Murphy's Oil was 50 times more efficient. If you're still tempted to buy this mop, just make sure you keep your receipt. I returned mine the very next day!"
2,DON'T Bother wasting your money!,"I thought this product would be great, but then reality set in. The pad is too small for the unit, you have to FORCE it on and the VERY first time I washed it, the drawstring came off of the pad and there was a rip in the pad also!!!! I have SEARCHED HIGH AND LOW ON THE INTERNET FOR REPLACEMENT PADS and there are NONE to be found!! Unit claims you can make your own pad by placing a piece of cloth on the bottom and securing it with the two plastic grips on either side, but I tried that with a piece of terry cloth towel and it makes the towel SOPPING WET and it does not stay on very well. I was very disappointed the second time i used this product. I do have to say the very first time I used the mop it seemed to leave the floor with a ""clean feeling"" but since then it's been downhill.... don't waste your money!!!"
3,Adequate,"Well, it is not all that I had hoped but it is an adequate mop and I have found a few uses for the handheld steamer part as well. I have a small kitchen and the cord is too short to do the whole floor without unplugging. If you are doing more than one floor you will need several mop heads on hand so that you can change them out, otherwise you will just be pushing dirt around your floor. I only have the kitchen floor and 3 bathrooms to do and need a minimum of 2 mop heads for it. (I recommend the Bissell steam mop replacement pads) The mop cover it comes with is extremely cheap and flimsy. Mine was tossed after the first use. If we move somewhere with more hard floors I will be purchasing a different kind of steamer for the floors. All things considered I would say it's worth about half of what it is priced at."
2,Ran Out of Steam after 1 Day,"Bought it after reading raves in Good Housekeeping. Cheap enough, and does pretty good job removing gunk from floors and other surfaces. But it's built cheaply, has very short cord, and after 1 day of cleaning kitchen floor and countertops, the connection to the steam nozzle broke. What a hassle to return it to Beach Camera -- if you buy this, house the packaging in a museum in case yours runs out of steam, too. Some sellers look for any reason not to take back a return, and they require packaging in pristine condition. My steamer is in the garbage, and I haven't even paid for it yet. Good idea, cheap execution."
2,Not what I was hoping for,My tile floors are not smooth tiles. This steamer does not clean the tile indentations or the grout. It also leaves alot of water behind. I drag a beach towel along with my feet as I use it to dry up the water. It only comes with one cloth head which is not sufficient to clean my entire tile area and it is difficult to try to attach other clothes to the unit - I tried using different methods of attachment.
1,I was disappointed...,"I found this mop heavy and cumbersome. The cord is very short. It comes with only one mop head cover which gets dirty in an instant. When used as a hand held in the bathroom, it seemed quite ineffective. I do not reccommend this product."
5,SF-290 Floor Steamer rocks,I saw your product in a magazine and had to have it. I am pleasedto report it works just as was promised!
1,Did not work when received,"It may be a great product, but it did not heat up enough to generate any steam from the time we took it out of the box. Just received a prepaid ups label to ship it back to the manufacturer. Let's say we aren't thrilled with it so far!"
1,A major disappointment,"I was really happy with this steam mop as it has attachments to clean other things besides the floors. It sprayed a lot of water, but I just assumed it was my problem and I would figure it out eventually. I tried to steam a shirt and it was soaked by the time I finished, AND the attachment flew off a couple of times, spraying steam and hot water everywhere. Luckily my curious two year son was behind me both times. The plastic piece on the handle that holds the cord broke the first time I tried to wrap it, but I figured I could live with that. HOWEVER! That was the first couple of days. The second time I tried to mop the floor, THE HANDLE SNAPPED IN TWO! I was not pushing it very hard at all! All in all, it is an amazing concept and worked fairly well, but like a lot of other products on the market these days, it was very cheaply made and broke easily. I am ordering the HAAN steam mop now and I really hope it is a better product."
1,"Works once, but that's it.",Used it once and it worked fine. Went to use it a second time and it doesn't work.
2,Broke the first time I used it - but turned me on to steam cleaning!,"The handle on the main steam unit cracked in two the first time I used it to steam clean my kitchen floor. This occurred when I applied a little downward pressure on the unit while cleaning. I did not apply excessive pressure, which indicates that either the unit I received was defective, or the design of this steamer is flawed. The break made the unit useless. I returned the unit promptly to Amazon (they paid the postage since the unit was clearly defective) and I received a full credit within one month.I give this unit two stars, instead of one, because it did convince me in the very short time that I used it that steam cleaning is the way to go. Since then I have purchased a much more expensive dry vapor cleaner which I am pleased with so far."
1,Non responsive mfr. Top Innovations,"The steam function is dodgy and despite the fact that it says your floor should dry immediately with steam that is, of course, not the case. Their flimsy pad immediately becomes soaking wet even if you use it on the low setting. 2nd to that after 15 minutes of use the telescoping wand on the mop collapsed. However, the worst aspect of the product is the non responsive mfr. Top Innovations.I contacted it's customer service department both via telephone and email to report these problems (within warranty) and have never received a response despite their claim that they will return your call/correspondence within 24 hours. I believe steam is a great non toxic choice for cleaning. I had high hopes for this product and am sorely disappointed."
3,Steam Mop,"Based on others reviews, I purchased this steam mop for a fairly open house containing both tile and laminate flooring.Unit heats up fast and generally is able to remove stuck-on splotches and kid-messes from both surface type.The cord is extremely short. Best find a light weight extension cord to use with it.Some condensation on the floor occurs, but without any sort of vaccuum ..who would expect hot steam not to condense on a cool floor?Handle, when fully extended feels like one slightly strong push might break it in half.Overall I am happy with the unit, just wish it were more sturdy.Floors are cleaner than theyve ever been."
5,An Gem of a film,"My mother is very picky about films and loved Morgan's Cake, its an indi Gem. Morgan is about to turn 18, he lives in a small room with his father. (Willie Boy Walker) He feels alienated by his artist mother, his girlfriend, and oncoming adult hood. This movie is worth it for Walker's apparently real life story of how he avoided military service in the late 1960's alone."
3,Not deep enough,"This is okay but I wanted something that held a little more water. You have to constantly change this water, it's way too shallow for my purposes."
3,Little Slow,"This was a Birthday Gift for my husband. I ordered it at the same time as 2 movies, one which wasn't even out yet, but those 2 movies came by my husbands birthday. These took several days more. Amazon was good with communicating with me so no anger, I was just sad that I had to print a picture for my husbands present instead of actually giving him the box. Other than that all is fine."
4,Pardon My Doo-Wah/Hefty,Anyone who likes the music of the 30's/50's will enjoy this CD.The Hefty Singers add something that makes Hefti's music more appealing.
4,good movie,"It was a good movie, I enjoyed it the ending was as it should have been and I think they are making this a movie for the big screen!"
4,What courage!,"Tried to put myself in that position her faith came through. She had courage, strength and strong determination to get her son back against all odds. Very good movie."
5,great film!,"yes it was based on a true story and after the premiere, the real woman had her own program come on after it going into further detail on the experience. must've been an awful nightmare for her! for film viewers, this is the one you should see! taraji does an excellent job portraying a mother trying to get her kid back!"
4,IT'S A VERY SERIOUS GAME,"Lifetime's interesting film about child abduction...well actually the child was with his father, but in a different country. The story is one of a mother's persistence in getting her son back, even if it means risking prison because she doesn't play by the rules. Tiffany Rubin (Taraji P. Henson) was able to pull it off because she had support from her second husband, a stranger who cared, a teacher who cared, and the US embassy which did everything it could within the law.The drama and dialouge aspect of the film was less than most films of this type, most likely because it kept to the real tale and didn't take as many liberties with dramatization other than the anachronism about Bill Clinton negotiating the release of the journalists. Good heart warming film, but not a nail biter."
5,Touching,"Touching, moving. Grab a box of tissue. Invite friends and family. This is quite an eye opener as well as overwhelming at times."
3,Ms. Rubin Role Model for Courage,"Inspirational characters portrayed in every cast member and the miraculous ending make for a very positive viewing experience. Perhaps the close encounters in Korea were exaggerated for suspense but overall script is exceptional. Many words of wisdom from Mom and Hubby perked my ears and for those who struggle daily with this situation my heart goes out to you with great sympathy, tears, and hugs. The church volunteer was truly amazing and solidifies the nature of man's basic instinct to protect. High recommend for superb acting and demonstration of perseverance, patience and prayer."
4,Good movie!,I didn't get to see this on Lifetime when it aired - so I thought I'd get it for my family that was visiting during the holidays and they really enjoyed it! Taraji is an excellent actress! I was exhausted at the end of the movie so busy rooting for her!!! Great movie!
4,"fast, nice design and great price!!!.","I purchased this computer recently after, having many problem with an HP computer since the day I bought it. This sony pc is able to run all my programs without freezing. I run photoshop, corel, flash and dreamveaver, it runs all the programs smoothly and fast. It also has a bunch of programs already preinstalled in the computer which are great for any multimedia use,, and its got a nice little keyboard with a wrist rester, and a nice little blue light....I reccomended it..."
1,Another failure from SONY,"My RX-550 never worked from the day it came out of the box. First there were connectivity problems with the internet then the power source went out (all in the first week) - third time for a failed power source in three different Sony computers - I'm a slow learner. Not even a modicum of help from what Sony calls support, I call it their aggravation department.Took this piece of junk back to the retailer"
3,Love the Computer But....,"I have had my Vaio rx-550 for over two years and love it. I have not felt the need to upgrade (not that I haven't had the itch) However if I was still into heavy graphics as I was when I had a small E-com biz I probably would have. It's fast enough, as fast or faster than most of the latest works, and has handled the big tasks I assigned it.The only problem I have had is I have fried two hard drives in two years. I thought it was me until I started reading some others thoughts and experiences with this modle.I recommend a Vaio, and getting one of these on the cheap."
1,Sony .... Good for the warranty....,"Well, it was a solid computer for the length of the warranty. Which is 1 year. A couple months after the warranty expired, BAM! The Hard Drive fried. Customer support is a drag when you run out of the warranty 3 hours waiting to hear that repairing it will cost 311$.... For that, I say spend your money else where, your better off without Sony."
1,Non Support,"Worked great out of the box...then the Sony updater and other features took over. No way to control system setup unless you are hip to scripts. No way to fix system setup (like in XP). I had to tell the tech that my setup disks could be bad, then I think they sent me a mixed set!!! It thinks it is XP Pro and Home. I'm going to buy real Windows disks and try to load the Sony software. Wish me luck."
1,SONY-Not at home,"I purchased the RX550 from a retailer other than Amazon three weeks ago. It has never worked. The monitor has flickered and the tower has a funny smell.At first I thought it was something that could be easily corrected. After going back and forth with Technical Support on at least three separate occasions, I learned that there is no authorized dealer in North Jersey who can come to my home, even if I were willing to pay. My only options are to convince the retailer to take it back or send it for repair. The tower would go to one place (paid for by SONY), but I would have to return the monitor at my own expense.If it works, it may be a great machine, but if it doesn't you are stuck. No one should buy this."
2,Really strange,Very offbeat. Hubby walked out halfway through. I wouldn't watch it again. It has the documentery style format where people spend most of their time talking to the camera. The story was kind of interesting. Characters were somewhat amusing. Not great.
4,stringer tanktop by athletica,I gave this a 4 and not a five because the main body of the shirt is a couple inches shorter then it should be. they seem to run a little small.
2,"Too Easy, Tedious Tasks","My son turned 7 a week before Christmas. He has a few video games (not many)and asked Santa to bring him this one. He finished all 14 levels in half a day. No matter what level you are on, you do the same tasks over and over again (drive a vehicle, figure out a maze, point & shoot, and press buttons in the right order).You can win amulets to unlock arcade games and costume pieces, but they are simple and uninspired. No where in the game did he ever have to ""think outside the box"" in order to complete a task.Very disappointing."
4,fun game for my 8 year old,My 8 year old loves to play this game on days when the weather is too bad to play outside. Will buy more spongebob games in future.
3,Spongebob Squarepants: Atlantis Squarepantis,My product was received before the date I was expecting and the overall experience with Amazon was excellent!! I will return to Amazon.com for future purchases!
5,Absolutely love this book,"I spent almost 6 months living in a Maasai Village, this is such a great detailed book that I read before traveling over there to understand the culture and bought once I got back. The book tells the life style of traditional Maasai culture."
2,Viva Max?,"Viva Max! is a dull, sometimes boring comedy. Filmed on location at the Alamo then relocated in Italy due to angry protesters interference in production, this movie stars Peter Ustinov as a Mexican General trying to re-capture the Alamo. Although Ustinov is great as the bumbling General, the only actor that could breath life into this movie was Jonathan Winters. Although Winters is at his best improvising comedy routines, he still manages to create some fairly funny scenes in this film. This film is a must-have for Ustinov and Winters fans. Otherwise, it bites."
1,Junk,"Purchased this machine awhile back and it was nothing but trouble.Maybe i was unlucky. Regardless, IMO, it is junk."
1,A LEMON,It did not work when I opened the box. I first tried to use it 33 days after receiving it and therefore could not return it. After 2 weeks at a factory repair facility I picked it up and it worked for 30 seconds. Sanyo is not user friendly about finding repair centers (phone list is out of date).
4,Very sweet book.,"While dated, this is a very affectionate look at New York from someone learning what they thought they knew but didn't really. And while ostensibly doint this work to help others see New York more clearly, the author/protagonist comes to appreciate what they find essentuially wonderful about the city."
2,Frustrating,"I found reading this book extremely frustrating. The author spends a great deal of time telling the reader how all economists are ignorant morons and how physicists are the only ones capable of tackling such a problem. True or not, I dont really care. I wanted to read about complexity and chaos theory in finance, and unfortunately I had to battle though muddled explainations of economic theory to get to anything worthwhile. I would not recommend that you buy this book as only about 50 pages are really worth reading - maybe get it out of the library. and i certainly wouldnt recommend it to anyone other than a physicist."
5,Billie is so cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I LOVE THIS SONG!I CANT WAIT TO BUY THE CD ON MAY 18TH.I JUST WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW WHEN THE CD COMES OUT.(BILLIES THE BoMb!!!!!!)
4,Excellent film,"What a fabulous production. The scenery, the palace, the story, and of course the captivating Debra Paget all contribute to an excellent movie that anyone who loves cinema should not miss. I am only somewhat discontented with the leading actor. If only Gary Cooper had been put in, then this film would be 100% perfect, and should earn 5 stars.SS"
2,Not very well made - very cheap plastic,"Seemed kinda overpriced for the poor quality of the construction. Also, it could just be me, but it seems like the USB plugs are up-side-down (I would naturally put them in the other other way, and have to remember to turn then USB plug each time I plug something in.)Otherwise - ok"
2,Didn't fit the exhisting hole.,"USB works as expected. My (factory) desk cutout was exactly 3"" but the Belkin unit was too big by about 1/8 inch. Had to break out the dremel and do some major sanding."
5,Funny...,"I am thrilled that this show has finally been released in the US. I left my VHS collection behind when I arrived in the US some year ago and have truly missed watching this excellent comedy. It was called `Men behaving badly' in England. Out of all the Britcoms, this is one show that I have no idea how well it will travel across the pond. Can be very heavy on slang and accents. Basically the whole show revolves around two guys, Gary and Tony. Both are lazy louts who like to get drunk. There was a pilot series made in the US but it flopped badly. I suspect because it was extremely tame in comparison and to enable it be shown on non cable before 11pm.As with most good series, it gets better over time. Series 2 sees the arrival of Tony and is where the comedy takes off proper."
4,TIM AND LUCY GO TO SEA by Edward Ardizzone (1958),"A very good childres book, still quite good even in todays times so that children can grasp the story and understand it."
5,Great lavish book!,"This book will serve as a perennial reference for anyone interested in ancient egyptian art. There are three notable features. Firstly, different sections are authored by experts in their respective field of study. Secondly, the photographs are lavishly presented with detailed full page close-ups. Third; each featured item has a catalogue no. and brief technical data as an entry point into a descriptive essay of the item. The photos are of immaculately high quality, a wonderful resource for illustrators, jewellery designers and the like. I have never seen Egyptian art pieces reproduced with such high quality in other books on this same topic. This feature puts this book head and shoulders above the rest."
5,10 stars is the correct rating !,"This book presents the collection of Egyptian antiquities located in the Egyptian Museum of Cairo; each featured object is accompanied by a short description and a photograph. The photographs, never before published, were expressly made for the book by internationally acclaimed photographer Araldo De Luca. The numerous essays were written by international contributors, among which are Francesco Tiradritti, Christiane Ziegler, Zahi Hawass, Jean Yoyotte and Anna Maria Donadoni Roveri; they cover topics such as Egyptian art, history, the Valley of the Kings and Tutankhamun. Art lovers will thoroughly enjoy this beautiful and informative guide, now available in many languages."
5,One of the most beautiful books I have ever seen.,"There are many books on the subject of Ancient Egpytian artifacts. This is without doubt one of the finest. The quality of the reproductions is of the highest calibre and the accompanying text illuminating and engaging. The Cairo Museum is custodian of a priceless heritage, both for the people of modern Egypt and the rest of humanity. Thanks to this volume, those of us who are not able to journey to Cairo can have a glimpse of the treasures they hold. I would love to see more editions of this type, highlighting particular sections of the collection."
5,Big is Good,"There are other reviews that have addressed this remarkable book in detail. I'm gonna keep things simple.This is a big book. When it comes to Egyptian art, big is good. Egyptian art is designed to impress, designed to communicate, and designed to impress due to the fine materials employed.And this book is big."
5,Be prepared to laugh,I like this show. Some of the ladies are little over the top. But aren't we all?
5,Elementary Teacher Prizes This Book!,"_The_Clear_and_Simple_Thesaurus_Dictionary is the most practical thesaurus I have found for use with my fourth- and fifth-grade students. Unlike many thesauruses, it is formatted in a style that students (and adults!) will find familiar and easy to use. While not as comprehensive in scope as those designed for college use, this thesaurus allows students the satisfaction of finding synonyms or associated words for almost any word they might need. I had not found this to be true of other ""beginning"" thesauruses, which was a frustration to both my students and to me. This gem was a major find, and is now in regular use in my classroom. I highly recommend it to any teacher of intermediate or junior high age students, as well as to parents who want a truly helpful resource for their school-age children."
3,A dissapointment,"This book has, unfortunately, been a disappointment for me. From reading the reviews written by others, I had high hopes for it, but it has not lived up to them in my family's particular experience. I bought this dictionary specifically for my son (age 12) to use, but literally every time he has tried to use it to look up a word he needs, it happens to be a word that has not been included. Just our dumb luck, I guess, but it seems this book is better suited to those in grades 1-4 and probably not beyond that."
2,Disappointing,I ordered these because I love using the earlier editions with my second grade class. This edition was revised to the point that it is no longer accessible to second graders. It is now a thesaurus and a dictionary. I liked it more as just a thesaurus. The typeface is much smaller now. I returned them. I will order more of the earlier edition.
5,Perfect for my 4th Grader,"My fourth grader was frustrated and overwhelmed with a ""regular"" dictionary. This one is perfect for his needs, easy for a child to read and find words and has made homework much easier for him."
5,Great addition,"I think Publisher's Weekly must've written that review on Sept. 12. The book is not perfect, but it's a very enjoyable read and a worthy addition to the series. I won't bother repeating the summary, since all the other reviews cover the plot, but the book's timing is uncanny. I highly recommend it."
3,Versions Vary,The first review of this book mentions parchment paper. The edition that I received was on magazine paper. It did not represent the level of reproduced antique that was expected. The family who received it seemed to like it.
3,I LOVE the Sex Pistols!! But.............,"Ok, the price is low, songs are great and the Sex Pistols are killer as always, but the sound quality is REALLY bad. There a lot of live tracks of the Sex Pistols on other cds that sound much more better... look for one of those."
1,"sound quality is "" pretty vacant "" here",save your money. the sound Quality is so bad that I'm tossing these 2 CD's in the trash. It sounds like it was recorded with a 3 dollar cassette recorder.
2,How much more material can you possibly add?,"The Sex Pistols are a very important ""band"", but what new material can you add to their short existence? Really ""Nevermind the Bullocks"" covers about 85% of all the good Pistols work. While ""The Great Rock 'n Roll Swindle"" has been bashed, it did have some choice cuts as well. So what is left? Three versions of ""My Way""... c'mon! Judging something before it is heard is wrong, but I have a feeling I am right on this one. Save your money"
5,Praise and Worship 101,"The first song I ever heard by Keith Staten was ""Show Us the Ancient Paths"", and from there I was hooked. All songs on this CD create a special atmosphere between the listener and God, one that shuts out all the world's distractions and allows you to concentrate on loving and praising the Father through song. My personal favorite is ""In Your Presence, O God"", for that's where I want to be: in His presence...protected, loved, and blessed. If you want to be blessed, experience ""Glory in the House""."
1,HORRIBLE! l,"I hate this stuff. It doesn't specifically say how to use it- so without knowing, I used quite a bit thinking it would be like a hair mask. Now my hair is greasy and oily and it is impossible to wash out. If anyone has tips on how to get this crap out of my hair, please let me know."
4,"For Project Managers to-be, only.","This book is written for web project managers to-be. I don't believe it will be very useful to experienced project managers. This book is good for people transitioning to web project manager / producer positions. I have several years of marketing management experience and am about to start a web producer position. So this book provided a good basic overview of web project management principles. For a rigorous treatment of navigation, design, info architecture, and other essential topics, I suggest you rely on O'Reilly as so many Amazon web category reviewers have done.I gave this book four stars because it is so thorough (truly a mile wide and an inch deep). But it doesn't get 5 stars because it was so poorly edited. Every chapter includes glaring grammatical mistakes, and in some cases even spelling errors. I question whether the editor (Elizabeth Spainhour) ever read this book!"
3,Mediocre recanning of Siegel's material into a business case,"Personally, I found this book a bland read - more akin to the dry business case books I read back in college - this book is aimed almost exclusvely at project managers and shop/salon owners. That being said, the material presented is useful and very good to know. Hence three stars - 4 for content, 2 for presentation.For anyone looking for the same information, I would recommend David Siegel's books as something that is not only mentally engaging - but visually as well. His book has something for everyone, and gives you concrete ""real world"" examples while you read (and explanations of why you should use it) instead of ""refer to chapter3\blah.doc on the CD-ROM""."
5,Excellent for all Web Project Managers,"I am a senior Web project manager and I am also doing my master degree in Web project management. This book is by far better than the others. The author follow a good methodology and give helpful and easy examples, she's very grounded. Recommended for junior as well as senior PM. (sorry for my poor English, I speak French!)."
2,The author missed the point,"Having read the book, I was astounded that the author has missed the point of the original published statistical paper on the Bible Code. What he has shown is that the Bible does not contain a hidden message at any particular skip code. The Bible Code is not at any particular skip sequence, but is single words in different skip patterns in close proximity. His computer code, though interesting, disproves what no one claims. Read Cracking the Bible Code for a more scientific and clear explaination of the Bible Code debate."
2,a confused scientist?,"I don't believe in Bible code, but reading this book is not a good start.It's about faith that is playing a big part of this book... However, it reveals some interesting bits and pieces of info that can't be found on major media..."
2,"NOT Enamel On Steel, Maybe Not Even Copco","Advertised everywhere as enamel on steel (and also as ""lightweight aluminum"" this kettle is worth about what they're asking. Not a bargain - it's extremely lightweight aluminum; the word cheesy comes to mind. The one I got didn't say Copco anywhere - the brand was ""Rowoco."" Amazon refunded my money, and kudos to Amazon for that."
3,Whistling kettle that doesn't whistle,"This kettle is nice and light, due mainly to it's aluminum construction. Due to the rather limited range in which the cap opens,I found it a little difficult to pour water into it. This kettle doesn't really whistle, it hardly makes noise at all. I think there was some production issues, since too much steam is coming out of the side of the cap,than the hole in the middle. This works if you are sensitive to noise, but is not good if you tend to walk away and may forget about it, since you can't hear it from another room.As an aside, I wonder if aluminum is a good material to use here. I like it's light weight, but the water doesn't seem as hot as from my previous steel kettle. My ramen noodles dont cook as nicely and I have to use the microwave to complete the cooking process...strange."
1,Gave this as a gift to fill in Amazon $25 free ship,"Recipient of gift never uses this, as they have an electric water boiler. It is useless."
2,The photographer is amazing!!,The pictures of this product does make one believe that the product is made of the most exquisite material and is probably one of the finest in the market. Not TRUE!The material is flimsy and so is the paint on the kettle. I do not think that I will buy this again.
3,No zing with the Zingo,"Made of aluminum which it makes it very light weight. Pours really easily. Boils quickly. But the whistle is soooo weak, it's barely audible. Since I paid $5 for it, I guess I got my money's worth. Don't think it's gonna last very long."
3,Why so many mistakes?,The book is very comprehensive but I am shocked and disappointed that something from Sports Illustrated would have so many mistakes. I found errors in almost every section. Many of them things that should have been caught by an editor.
3,"""Mistake Free?""","I enjoyed this almanac immensely. There is a new trivia section that can stump even the genius of sports. There were many errors and some in every section. I don't understand what the rush to finish the almanac was. Hopefully, it's mistake free next time."
4,and the Angels sing - - - -,"In one package the lifelong efforts of this inveterate world traveler are enshrined. Undaunted by the devilish technical difficulties of manipulating such an archaic instrument as the harp, Daphne Hellman plunges into Baroque, Country and Western, Classical, Pop, Tin Pan Alley, and Be Bop styles. Supported by her willing troupe of ""angels"" she produced a body of work given wide review in this CD. With intrepid daring she plunged, ""where angels fear to tread"", into areas yet to be fully explored by other harpists. We are left with a brave document of individual creativity. Curiously engaging, the angels continue to smile."
2,Not so special,"This quick change bit is short and on the ""sticky"" side. Compared to other quick change adapters, this one is low on my list. I will keep this one to loan to the guy who never brings back tools. I suggest you go down to your local hardware store and look at all your options on length and ease of use."
3,"Nice tool, package impossible to open",The tool is good quality and works well. But first you have to get it out of the hard plastic package it comes in. Only way I could do that was to crush the package with vice-grips. A real pain.
3,A little slow,"I felt like this book, even compared to the rest of the copious series, had a little more sitting and waiting and talking about what we're going to do than I could handle.Still, it's an integral part of the series, as it sets up events in later books."
2,Skip this one,"I was captivated by Whyte's first four Camulod novels (4 stars each) and was of course looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, it was hands down, the most unrewarding book I've read in a LONG time. Nothing interesting at all.Merlyn and young Arthur hide in an old abandoned Roman fort (at River's Bend). They fix up the fort, Arthur grows up, Merlyn falls in love, and they hear a few rumors from back home in Camulod. That's pretty much all that happens in 461 pages.Take my advice and skip this one. His next book, SORCERER, begins with a short prologue (one and a half pages) that recaps the events of FORT AT RIVER'S BEND perfectly and saves you quite a bit of time."
4,Great book but it could stand some editing,"This is the first of two books called the Sorcerer; part two is subtitled: Metamorphosis These are parts five and six of what I think is the most entertaining and plausable retelling of the Authurian legend I have ever read. My only comment is that they should both have been part five. There was a fair bit of unnecessary material in both books, that if edited out, would have made an outstanding single book.Besides this, volume 5 continues like the others to be a very engrossing read. The story of post-Roman Britons remaking their society in a land being overun by invaders is facinating. I highly suggest reading it along with all others in the series."
1,....................................................,"If you took out all the useless parts, this book would be about 15 pages long."
2,Crescendo's BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS CD,"WARNING! For those planning to order the Crescendo BATTLE BEYOND THESTARS/HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP CD, the back insert reads: ""This CD wasproduced from the best available analog AND VINYL masters andtherefore certain limitations from these sources may be evident""(emphasis mine). BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS is simply ... from the old1980 Rhino LP. Therefore, pops and snaps are evident, which is exactlywhat many people try to avoid by purchasing CDs! The Rhino LP actuallyhad very powerful dynamics, which sound stifled on the CD. HUMANOIDSFROM THE DEEP is not taken from an LP, and the sound quality is onlyslightly inferior to the Cerberus LP in 1980. The musicfor both of these scores is wonderful, so I would recommend looking for the original LPs."
1,received package with broken glass--TWICE--LOUSEY PACKAGING,REALLY DON'T KNOW IF PITCHER IS GOOD OR NOT. COMPANY COULD NOT GET ONE TO ME IN ONE PIECE. WHOEVER PACKS THESE PITCHERS DOES NOT KNOW SQUAT ABOUT PACKAGING.
1,Poor Quality - Not Up to Luigi Bormioli Standards,"I have a number of pieces from the Luigi Bormioli Gallerie collection. All but this pitcher are high quality. I have the 84 oz. pitcher and it has been wonderful to use.This pitcher cracked when I washed it prior to using it. It went straight from the box, to my sink, to my recyclable bin.I recommend spending the extra few dollars for the 84 oz. pitcher."
3,"Stylish, but didn't pour well, and eventually broke","Looks pretty, and got lots of compliments on it.In terms of function, it spills a bit when you pour from it. You have to learn how to use it correctly, believe it or not!Eventually broke after about 8 months of use. We hit it on the countertop (not too hard), and it cracked along the top. Now we use it to water plants.In retrospect, I would probably invest in a more durable, functional pitcher if I could do it again (and will have to now that this one needs replacing)."
1,don't waste your money and time !!!!,"i was attracted by the shape/ style and larger size. once it was delivered i found the pitcher is not symmetrical, ie they don't care about quality control. since the glass is very thin it already got a crack line with very light hit while filling in the kitchen. i'd suggest to look for a better QUALITY product!!!"
1,Review -Rebecca's Tale,I could not get past the second chapter. I found this book boring and over-written.
1,Don't waste your time,"I didn't read this book -- I listened to it on tape. I don't think I would have been able to get through it otherwise. Du Maurier's Rebecca is a classic -- it's not some kind of political tract tied to a decade the way this very poor sequel is. This book abounds with New Agism, rabid feminism, and politically correct homosexuality. It's very much a book of 2001, not 1951. Like other readers, I may just re-read the original just to get the nasty taste of Rebecca's Tale away from me."
3,Death of a girl...,"I read the mystery novel Rebecca's Tale by Sally Beauman. I thought the book was very hard to understand, especially in the beginning. It was hard to understand who was talking and what was happening. This book was basically about how a girl dies 20 years ago for a mysterious reason. The Frier is trying to find out why she died and how. The main characters eventually find out how she died.""One minute he was the boot boy, the next he was a butler, draw your own conclusions."" I didn't understand what kind of conclusions he meant and about what.""You won't get rid of me that eaisily."" When I read this I thought there was going to be a fight, and there was.Overall the text was very interesting. I would recommend this novel for anybody who understands difficult pieces of writting. I rated this book 3 stars because of the difficult language."
1,hello?,"seriously, has a sequel written by another auther EVER come even close to the original? no. and this is not the only sequel to the amazing novel Rebecca. deconstructing du maurier's deliberate vagueness about rebecca, maxim and his second wife is a doomed and misguided venture from the start. the POINT of the novel was that you don't know. and all attempts to clarify any of this by any other author just have such a feeling of being false even from the start. it isn't what REALLY happened (if anything in a work of fiction can be real), it is someone else's imagination. anyone could say what they thought the truth was, but that would make them no closer to du maurier's true intentions. so-called authors of these types of books need to stop capitalizing on other great works of literature and develop their own ideas. if they can't think of something new, they shouldn't be writers."
1,"A waste of time, money & shelfspace. Stick to the original.","One of the worst books I have ever read. The character of Colonel Julyan seems to have been based on Louella Parsons or Hedda Hopper, and Rebecca has had a heaping dose of Shirley MacLaine. The author has attempted to give the book more of a duMaurier feel by using surnames from duMaurier's other books for her characters. Descriptions of people and places are lifted almost word-for-word from the original. The book oozes with some of the worst of current politically correct and new age ideas."
3,"Interesting literary sequel, but . . .","I found this novel extraordinarily engaging, yet ultimately unsatisfying--I think because, beautifully written as it is, it's merely an inversion of the novel on which it's based. Part of the new story is a kind of ""flashback,"" in which some of the original story related in Daphne du Maurier's REBECCA is revealed from Rebecca's point of view--and while questions about her motivation remain, Rebecca is rendered much more sympathetically than the second Mrs. de Winter (narrator of the original novel). Then, too, the new novel is partly a love story involving new characters, but it turns out to be a kind of negative variation of the love story in REBECCA. Sally Beauman has fashioned an interesting literary sequel to Daphne du Maurier's masterpiece, but I suspect I would find Beauman's own original novels more satisfying."
2,Takes Away the Intrigue of the Original Book,"This story basically kills what made the original novel so great.Col. Julyan, an extremely minor character in the original book, secretly madly in love with Rebecca 20 years later?His daughter (who would have been 10 when she died), thinking about nothing except Rebecca?Mrs. Danvers, still obsessed with Rebecca?All these people obsessed about a dead woman???Without the original book, the story would never have stood on its own. It took me a while to even get into it, and the only reason I read it was because the original was so good.If you truly loved the original book, don't read this book because it will totally destroy that."
2,Left Feeling Cheated,"The story itself was very captivating but the ending was horrible. It seems as though the author either couldn't find a satisfactory ending or became tired of the whole thing! This book left us with too many new questions and even fewer answers. I sincerely wish that I had stopped at ""Rebecca"" for my own piece of mind."
2,No classic Rebecca this,"I found this book to be too long, tortuous and frustrating. Too many plot lines winding all over the place and never fully resolved. The threads of homosexuality and feminism seemed contrived and unnecessary. Beauman is no du Maurier. Couldn't wait to finish this twisted tome and put it on my library's used book table. May the original, masterful ""Rebecca"" rest in peace."
2,A sheer disappointment!,"As a huge fan of Du Maurier I anxiously picked up this novel proposing to pick up where Rebecca left off. The author failed miserably at this attempt. Whereas Du Maurier is able to delve into the psyche of her characters, Beauman has replaced the intriquing original characters with cardboard cut outs. The script was laborious and tedious. It lacked depth. Fans of Rebecca will not necessarily enjoy this book. I am tempted to suggest that fans of Rebecca not waste their time reading Rebecca's Tale. Sadly, it very often disappoints."
2,Rebecca's still a mystery,I was very disappointed with this book. I only read it because I love Daphne DuMaurier's writing and had re-read Rebecca last year. Questions about Rebecca's death/murder/suicide aren't answered. I don't understand why this book was written. What was the point?
1,That's all it's about,"She takes off her shirt and now is trying to profit from it. If it's not about the bra, why is it on the cover? Bad example for young women, worst book ever."
1,It is about the Bra,The only person in the world who has been trying to make a big deal of Brandi Chastain's Bra is Brandi Chastain
2,Nancy Drew #35,"I'm almost always a HUGE Nancy Drew fan. This one was just not all that good. I found the ""mystery"" way to easy to figure out. Almost right away Nancy found out who the bad-guy was. There was just too much time wasted in the book, seriously the characters didn't do as much as they usually do. She had evidence against people, but she didn't do anything with it, it almost seems like she forgot it. I was thinking the ""Haunted Showboat"" would be scary like everyone said, but it wasn't at all. Having read more than half the series, which means some books set the mark high, this was just lower. It was a let down for ME. I wouldn't get this if I were you."
2,The Series Goes Downhill,"Nancy, Bess and George go to New Orleans at Mardi Gras time to solve a mystery concerning a haunted showboat and the strange occurances onboard the ship. The mystery must be solved by Mardi Gras time so that Bess and George's aunt and uncle can use the showboat for a ball they are planning to have. Personally, I didn't find this book to be very good; although, it is not really bad. There isn't much action in the book and the mystery isn't overly exciting. In fact, by the time you get through the silly shenanigans concerning the girls being chased on their way to New Orleans by a man who stole Nancy's old car and the obligatory tour guide through New Orleans and actually get into the mystery, the book is already 1/3 over. Some fans may like this book, but I didn't really care much for it and it's not one that I'd highly recommend."
4,Fun and Huge!,"They look small on the product page but they are actually very large, detailed, and quite durable. For any kid who loves snakes, they are quite fun."
4,"Excellent, but a bit complicated.","I bought and read this book after seeing the author interviewed on BookTV.The book is an excellent portrayal of a great woman, the first female on the United States Supreme Court.At times I regretted not being a lawyer, as many of the discussions are about specific cases and complicated legal issues.It is difficult to determine the political leanings of the author (perhaps relating to the fact that she received help from many experts of different political leanings).But Biskupic obviously is very fond of O'Connor, appointed to the Court by President Reagan...and since I'm an admirer of his, that's enough for me.I recommend this book to anyone interested in American politics and contemporary history,"
4,Who Is Sandra Day O'Connor?,"In what will likely become a standard work on Justice O'Connor's years on the high court, this book not only details how she became the influential swing vote but also how she evolved from conservative to moderate. This is an interesting political and legal biography encompassing some of the most controversial issues facing the nation in the past three decades. The author holds a law degree but has developed a career as a journalist, court reporter, and editorialist, so she can read the law and she can write.Recommended reading if you want to understand the law behind episodes of ""Law and Order."""
3,Good but pedestrian,This is a book dealing with the first female Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.The author tries to delve into the mind and thought-processes of this complex individual who on the one hand is a country girl who manages through hard work to transform herself into a society queen.So what is the book like? It is very workmanlike without being ever exciting. It is readable but not the first choice I would recommend. The reason for this is that I think the author had great trouble getting the goss from O'Connor and those closest to her. The end result is a fairly staid piece of writing.
5,"Best ""behind the scenes"" since The Brethren","No author to date has fine-tuned the story of O'Connor from ranch to robes as well as Ms. Biskupic. The extent of her study and interviews shows, but does not become an academic report. It is fresh and insightful, and certainly as amusing and straight-shooting as its subject.If you are interested in the law, the Supremes, history in the making, or simply the politics of what it means to be a woman in the law, this is the book you want to read."
4,Glad they invented this product!!!,I love this cup. It is extremely easy to clean because of its ease to take apart. I don't have to worry about anything &quot;growing&quot; in the stoper because it can be completely cleaned.
2,Leaky in Iowa,"I found these cups to be a good transition for my daughter from the bottle. But like the Avent bottles, they leak all the time. I would expect a product that is so pricey to be top notch. These were far from it. I tried different packages and they all leaked to some degree. I would not recommend these unless you want to be cleaning up messes all the time!"
3,I hate the handles,I decided to wean my son directly from breast to cup instead of breast to bottle to cup. He can't hold the handles very well because they move so much. The cup would be so much better if they were attatched to the cup. Other than that I love the spout and everything else.
2,"Over rated, over price","I been using avery feeding bottles, so when my baby got older I immediately bought the same brand for her..but..This cup certainly is not as magical as they claim, it cost too much, my baby doesnt like to use it, as for cleaning, there is TOO many pcs to take out & put back, I would recommend PLaytex intead of this, cost 1/2 of avery"
2,HELP!!,"My daughter is completely frustrated with sippy cups because of this product. The cup has to be completely upside down to get any liquid out - I have tried it myself! And for a 10 month old just learning to use a sippy cup by herself, this is a nightmare! Has anyone else had experience with this?"
4,"Love the cup, but a little pricey","I finally bit the bullet and bought one of these cups for my 4 month old. He drinks out of any sippy cup, but I liked the soft spout. My 2 yr old also likes it and the spout doesn't show his teeth marks as well as others. I wish these cups were a little less expensive and I could find them in more stores, but they are good. This cup gets 4 stars for price and you have to get the lid on just right so it doesn't leak."
2,"Non-spill spout but not ""non-leak"" cup","The benefit and selling point of the cup is that it is interchangeable with the bottles and Isis breast pump. However, there is nothing magical about these cups. The spout, for the most part, is leak-proof, but the cup itself is not. The beverage often leaks from under the rim once the cup has been tipped upside-down and then returned right-side up. As a result, I no longer allow my child to handle her own cup, and when going out, I place the cup is a plastic bag (and take a lot of wipes). I intend to replace these immediately with another brand."
4,Great Cup!!,"I tried and tried and tried to get my son to drink out of a sippy cup. I held off on buying these because they were a little more expensive and looked bulky for little hands. Eventually I gave in, and THEY ARE WONDERFUL. My son really likes the flatter spout, and it's firm but still pliable, so it's nice on his teeth and gums when he tries to chew it. The only reason I don't give this product 5 stars is due to the bulkyness... however if you buy the wings that are sold seperately it makes the product ABSOLUTELY wonderful!! My son really loves them, and weaning to the bottle has been VERY easy - he's done it himself... Definently worth spending a little extra."
2,Not a soft spout,This has a hard spout and my daughter won't drink her milk from it. It's not a good transition cup from a bottle.
3,Just ok,"It's not a fantastic sippy cup, it's just alright. My daughter was exclusively breastfed for 6 months with no bottles or solids, and is still nursing at 22 months. She never had a problem transitioning between the different brands of sippy cups. Some flow a little slower, and that frustrates her, but she gets used to it. This brand isn't fantastic, it does leak if not put together perfectly and as someone else mentioned, the valves are clear, small, and get tossed around the dishwasher a lot (so you have to go searching for them on the bottom of the dishwasher.) I wouldn't really recommend them, in a pinch, they'll do, and my daughter will drink from them, but I wouldn't buy more."
2,"Leaky, dribbles everywhere","These cups drive my wife crazy. Cleaning them is no problem - just take all the pieces apart and put them in the dish washer. We have a bunch of them so there's always one available. We have the soft tips and the hard tips. We used Avent bottles and the tops screw on those too. We have the handles - those work great. The problem is the sippy cups dribble everytime they're turned over. Our children learned to use open cups and never really got into sippy cups, but we still need a closed lid cup for car travel. These just don't cut it. We're looking at sports-bottle types, straw types, and flip types but haven't found the perfect thing yet."
3,Too many pieces,"I bought these cups because I had succes with the bottles and the breast pump. These cups are okay. Liquid gets trapped between the parts so if you are switching from juice to milk throughout the day you would have to take it apart each and everytime to clean it. The pieces are small and clear so they are difficult to find if put in a drawer or even the dish rack. These are also not good to send with your child to relatives or on play dates. You would have to show them how to take it apart and put it back together. It is easy, but I have found that grandma and even dad still put the pieces on in the wrong order, they loose the pieces or they don't put them on at all. If you are going to purchase these cups I would suggest buying additional spouts for easy changing and just in case they get lost. Other than that they are spill proof and easy for toddlers to hold."
3,Avent bottle,The avent bottles worked well but they only would let out a tiny amount of liquid at a time making it very hard for my baby to get any big quantities of liquid.
3,Too many parts,"The cup is nonspill, that's true. There are three parts for the nipple assembly alone. They are hard to take apart after a day of juice."
1,NOT SOFT SPOUT CUPS,"These cups are the hard spout cups - not the soft Avent ones. AMAZON: CHANGE THE DESCRIPTION I had purchased a soft spout one at the store to see if my daughter would like it, and she does. So, I decided to purchase these larger cups thinking that they would be perfect, but they are not what the description says they are."
2,Poor Quality,"The chrome cover looked cheap and was,it did not fit my fuel door correctly and was warped and there wasn't enough two sided tape to secure it to the door.I sent it back for a refund."
5,Awesome!,"This is an awesome model! Working parts (Doors, hood, steering wheel, etc.) Great quality, but NOT a toy. Good for keeping on display; has a phenomenal level of detail."
5,The master of blues,"The tracklisting says all, his songs was covered by The Doors, Rod Stewart, Led Zeppelin, Cream, Rolling Stones, Megadeth... Willie Dixon is the master of blues"

4,Noteworthy later album by a countrypolitan legend,"I can't say I was ever a huge fan of ""Whispering"" Bill's late-'60s glory years at Decca... As a songwriter he rightfully deserved high praise, but as a performer I found him hopelessly mired in the wimpiest pop excesses of the Nashville Sound... That's why this album from the year 2000 is such a pleasant surprise. Taking a page from Chip Taylor's book, Anderson has adopted a gruff, grizzled old-timer persona, with a slight Don Williams softness... These are songs about growing old, having grown old, looking back, and not losing that loving feeling... Yeah, maybe today's Country Top 40 ain't likely to touch acoustic-based country like this with a ten foot playlist, but it's an interesting footnote to one of Music City's most illustrious careers, and far more vigorous a release from Anderson than I would have ever anticipated. If you're an old-schooler, this one might be something you'd want to give a listen or two."
5,sailing can reveal our inner selves,"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. The insights into sailing, alcoholism, child rearing & powerlessness over other people, places & things struck a note to my very soul. I look forward to her next novel & would love an opportunity to talk with Pamela. Pass along to her my e-mail address if you would."
5,Tasty,"Taste is a matter of a preference and subjectivity so subjectively I give this one 5*. I must confirm, however, that the rest of the family agrees these Cliff's are the best."
2,Just Eh,I was so excited to see that they had a Coconut one and couldn't wait to try it. It was bland and it just didn't taste fresh. I won't be purchasing again.
5,Yummm Gingerbread,They are so delicious! We love them and they are so hard to come by since they are a seasonal item. The shipping was quicker than they said it would be!
5,Delicious and satisfying,I love having one of these in my backpack for anytime I am hungry and can't have some real food like during work or out for a long walk. These taste great and are reasonably filling.
1,sits in stomach like a rock,"Like other CLIF bars, they taste ok at first and then have a weird aftertaste like you ate something too rich, too filling. Then they sit in your stomach like a rock. I realize they're trying to make their bars more like granola cookies, but you can't have it both ways. Besides I don't know if these bars work because they are so rich, they're too granolaly."
2,blueberry flavor tastes artificial,"We've tried lots of Clif Bar flavors; this is my least favorite. My hubby liked them fine, but I think the blueberry flavor is fake-tasting & overpowering. I can't imagine ClifBar actually uses artificial flavoring, it's probably just dried blueberries which are more intense. But, it's too sweet for me. I much prefer their Carrot Cake and Maple Nut flavors."
3,there are worse things you can eat...,"...but there are much better things, too!WORSE THINGS: candy bars, fast food, donuts, etc.BETTER THINGS: fresh fruit (bananas, oranges, grapefruit, etc.), dried fruits (almonds, dried apricots, prunes, raisins, etc.), fresh yogurt, seeds (sunflower, pumpkin, etc.)These bars don't taste bad and are convenient in emergencies but if you can find just an extra 5 minutes to put together a more natural snack on the go, you'll be much better off."
4,One of my favorite Clif Bars!,"I think that the Gingerbread Clif Bars are really delicious, and they are by far one of my favorite varieties of Clif bar. I recommend perhaps popping them in the microwave for no more than 10 seconds - when warm, it takes like a piece of warm gingerbread!"
1,misleading,Advertised to include the MyArtStudent Access Code Card. Did not state would not include if text was used. Purchased a used book so had to purchase the code card elsewhere. A waste of time and money from this vendor.
4,"Whoa, that's a lot of key changes guys...","After ""Grey Lantern"" you couldn't help but want a follow-up to sound as different, and well, that's exactly what they've done with this one. I'm not one to listen to prog rock, but forgive me, this is prog rock; a spoken word track by Tom Baker no less! As far as musicianship goes, Mansun are so talented that it gets frustrating trying to follow the paths they design. While it is nice to know that this record should be consumed as a whole, it can be labouring to make it through the full 70-odd minutes without wondering if your audio equipment has a skip in it.I love Mansun, don't get me wrong, and ""Legacy"" may very well be the best song they've ever recorded, but this isn't an album you're going to listen to everyday. Perfect for those late nights, though."
5,A musical chameleon,This has everything in it. Do you like pop? It's in it. Hard Rock? Inside. Progressive guitar movements? Sure. Cool-cut reggae? Come on in. It's a package for everyone.
5,Extraordinary,"""Six"" is a difficult album to describe. It's all over the place musically, but I've never heard such a beautiful mess. From the beginning of the title track all the way through to the infectious ""Being a Girl"", Mansun prove to be one of the few forward-thinking bands of the day. Dominic Chad is a brilliant guitarist, and Paul Draper writes more personal lyrics than were apparent on their first album, ""Attack of the Grey Lantern"". This is the ""Achtung Baby"" of the late '90s...an album that deserves to lead us into the future. If possible, pick up the import version of the album, it has an alternate (and interesting) cover, and the tracks are arranged to reflect the cynical (sinister?) concept of the album."
4,Mind blowing music -,"This was my first Mansun experience. I'm really not good at critiquing music, but I can tell you that this album is like a hypnotic trip back up the rabbit hole. Everything gets clearer and you get sucked into the spiral that is Mansun. You think you might break free and end up back at the base of everything that is pure and safe, but then you're surprised and tripped into a circle of raw emotions and powerful riffs. It's addicting. Once you start listening, you can stop. Each song melds with another, and there is no break. And you won't want a break. It's one long procession of swirling jams that you can't get out of your head for days on end. You'll be strung out on Mansun, and it's a wonderful feeling."
3,"Good, but disappointing compared to their debut album","Mansun's debut was ""Attack Of the Grey Lantern"", a dark concept album with recurring themes. ""Six"" is similar in that it too has recurring themes, but it fails somewhere. I think that maybe it trys too hard in places to be clever. But there are some great moments, ""Legacy"" being the best one. ""Being a Girl"" is instantly contagious, and ""Special/Blown It"" is a cynical tune ith a great beginning. All in all, a good album. I would have given it 3.5 stars if I could. But it falls short of ""Attack Of The Grey Lantern"", and most albums do."
5,A Good Tool.,I bought this to replace one purchased long ago. It works great. Dont have to worry about the ends staying in the heads. Especially on the DOHC engines where they are recessed. Came with ends for a Motorcycle or Small engine.
1,"Totally worthless ""professional tester""",This MV5530 compression gauge did not work correctly right out of the box. Almost cost me a lot of unnecessary repair time and money. There is no good reason for Mityvac to ship a new gauge that does not work. Buyer beware of this company's products.
3,Much Better in English,"I did not think I would ever finish this movie; however, with assistance from my translator I finally finished and am somewhat sorry for taking so long. English is our language of preference and others are but words from another tongue making little to no sense. Overall the movie was simply average without nothing that stood out nor was it a complete waste of time other than having to have it translated by another when necessary which was most of the time. Saying that something was lost in translation is an understatement when you are monolingual. The technical side of the DVD reflected less than superior craftsmanship and not up to the standards most us take for granted. My giving this a 3 star is neither meaningless nor meaningful. For me it was simply an average movie comparable to most to today's B to C rated movies and hardly worth the cost of cash or time."
3,english subtitles,"I just got the Elite Squad 2 DVD and I was pissed to find out that I can't take the enlgish subtitles out of the feature film! I have lived in Brasil, watched Elite Squad 2 in the theaters over there and speak perfect portuguese, but in this dvd I have to stand stupid enlgish subtitles during the whole movie! I mean, isn't it basic that you can turn off subtitles on a dvd? I am very disappointed, and even more so to find out that on the Making Of featurette, you can turn off the subtitles, but not in the movie. Shameful!I was wondering, if anyone bought the Blu-Ray of Elite Squad 2, can you turn off the subtitles on the blu-ray version?"
2,Boring,I am sorry. I like crime and action movies and this one just plods along. If it wasn't for the exotic scenery it would be unwatchable.
3,An illustrated lecture.,"The narration tells us what we need to know. The visuals illustrate some of the key points. They're good visuals. The information delivered is good information to know. The delivery method keeps the audience distanced from any real emotional investment. Maybe that's necessary as audience investment would make a film that would be too difficult to watch, or maybe the filmmakers just didn't hit on a form for the story that could deliver the punch they hoped to."
3,Atrocious Subtitles,"This sequel to Tropa De Elite lacks the first film's febrile intensity. This one is more of a thinking man's movie about political corruption, questioning just who are the true criminals in Brazilian society? While I prefer the first film overall, this one is not without its charms. Be warned, however: the subtitles in this film are the worst I have ever seen bar none. Small white lettering often set against light on screen scenery made reading dialogue impossible throughout. If you do not understand Portugese, be prepared to use the pause and zoom buttons on your remote frequently. I would have even preferred a hack dubbing job to this."
4,Good Drama,"Good Drama. I was surprised that there was no english spoken since all the reviews were in english. It does have subtitles in english for those who can read. Be warned it is very violent so no kids for this one, the R rating is serious here. Good production quality on par with any hollywood made films."
1,Not in English very violent,In my opinion this movie was senseless. It was set in Brazil because they wqere speaking Portuguese. I lost interest in less than 15 minutes. Lots of violence and no real plot.
5,"Brazilian version of ""Tom Clancy's Clear & Present Danger"" and better!","This is the sequel to the excellent Brazilian flim Elite Squad.This time around the narration is even better, more organize, and more compelling.I don't remember when was the last time Hollywood made such a compelling story.No big mindless explosion, no sci-fi type over the top 3D computer effect.Just plain old fashion story telling with a strong script and excellent acting on the part of all actors who played a part.We certainly need more movies like this with a good story instead of just mindless eye-candies."
5,Believable portrayal of internal corruption in Rio's police,"Elite Squad: The Enemy Within is a well made film with some fantastic scenery of the Rio de Janeiro area and a very realistic story depicting the corruption very much alive in the state's police force.One man is determined to do what he can but he is against a whole tide of corruption. Human rights hero Fraga and a local journalist are two of the only people who seem to be on the same wavelength.Following the initial prison riot at the start of the film, there's lots of shooting, killing and other wrongdoings around the favelas of Rio. The police and politicians seem to be just as bad as each other.There's lots of dialogue in the film and the English subtitles occasionally switch too quickly, but that is the only fault in this excellent piece.Decent extras on the DVD include a look behind the scenes.Having visited Rio recently, the film certainly looks very authentic and strangely, had me yearning to return.Enjoy!"
4,Tools,Very good tool for those hard to get to areas where there's not enough room for your hand and the tool...
3,"Ok, but not good.","I've had this item for about 5 years, and maybe used it all of a dozen times for light duty stuff. Today, I tried to use it for some medium duty work, and my $20 bit got stuck in the extension. I tried for about an hour to wriggle it out, but ended up having to cut the extension open to get my bit out. Next time I'll buy the old style extension with the hex screws..."
3,"Worked okay, but has limitations.","Would not recommend for drilling holes marginally larger than the quick release barrel. Problem is that the release can become engaged and cause a bad connection with the bit you're driving, stripping both the shank of the bit and the teeth of the release. Otherwise it was okay, but I had to replace the extension with a non-quick release version that uses hex nuts for tightening."
2,"Pretty, but disappointing","I bought this phone intending to use it as a back-up phone/pocketable phone to my PDA phone. Unfortunately, it has a very primitive (as opposed to basic) user interface that is not easy to navigate. The phone also turns out to be much thicker than I had hoped - its no RAZR. The cover does have the speaker, but is otherwise a cheap-feeling plastic shell that adds to the already thick body. There is a colorful display of flashing lights and tones when the phone powers up and shuts down, but otherwise, it's nothing notable. The battery/back cover is a bit of a pain to remove - it requires two hands - one to press the release button, the other to slide the cover off.I haven't had a Motorola phone for ages, but this seems like a skin job on some old platform. The software seems as old as the StarTac phones of yesteryear. Get with it Moto! - your software is the most primitive in the industry."
2,Motorola E380 Unlocked Cell Phone--U.S. Version with Warranty,"This phone looks cool, but man does it suck. Cheap, cheap, cheap, barely useable. Worst sound quality ever."
5,LOOOOVE IT!,"I really love this phone. It has awesome ringtones and I love that it lights up beautiful colors. You can also set this phone to light up to the beat of music, which only does it for 10 straight minutes, but it's still really neat. It's light and sleek, and everyone compliments me on how awesome it is. The only bad thing I can say about this phone is that it sometimes won't ring, like 2-3 times a month, so not a lot, but turning it off and on again fixes that problem. Also, I am not recieving text messages right away. It usually takes a whole day to get the text message but that could have something to do with my phone service. All in all, I am very satisfied with this product. The shipping was fast too. I got my phone in like 2 days!!"
1,Yuck,"This is one of the only books I'm willing to pay my own shipping to return it. I bought this because I liked 'Twas the Fright Before Christmas, and I liked the unique yet cute artwork of all the monsters in it and the details in the background. But this book, The House that Drac Built-- it's hard to believe it's the same artist! I have tons of picture books, and this has the ugliest artwork of them all. The manicore is gross-- a weird face and sausage-link tail. I didn't find the artwork creepy or scary in the way I'd love to see in a Halloween book for a change, but this art was just completely unappealing. I love Halloween picture books, but I highly recommend In the Haunted House and The Bones of Fred McFee, both by Eve Bunting, Room on the Broom by Julia Donaldson, The Old Lady who Was Not Afraid of Anything by Linda Williams, or for an edgier book, Cinderella Skeleton Robert D. San Souci all over this one."
1,failed to mention the DEMON / DEVIL in the book,"The book is absolutely not appropriate for the age given. The gruesome (editorial words above) characters build up from midly fearsome to a demon/devil feeding a bloody old/undead lady. The demon's name is the ""Fiend of Bloodygore"". No child should be exposed to this greusome artwork. The author attempts to make it a ""Children's book"" by entering children into the story at the end. SICK!"
5,One of my favorites,"The idea of Mythago Wood is very compelling.What makes the story even more interesting is the author's use ofmore obscure elements of myth. It makes the mythagos much more dark,scary and interesting. More like Grimms Fairy Tales than Disney."
3,Muddled,"Although I enjoy fantasy as much as the next guy, this book is a jumbled morass of mythology, fantasy and sombre fiction that does not quite hold together. Some of the characters are intriguing however, but the line between reality and myth becomes increasingly obscure and ends up being confusing to the reader and makes the story muddled, lacking any direction. I wouldn't lend this book to anyone or recommend it."
3,Interesting but lacking,"After reading many of the glowing reviews and thinking that the premise was interesting, I decided to make my purchase. However while I found the books premise interesting I was really put off by the ""pedophilish"" (?) interest the main characters took in Guiwenneth...come on she seemed to be about 14 or 15 and we get paragraph upon paragraph describing her child-like body.....very gross. Other than that (which for me was enough to ruin it). While the story at spots was uneven and convoluted I found the description of the relationship Christian and Steven had with their with father to be so very poignant."
5,Spellbinding,"Mythago wood is one of the finest fantasies ever written. It's engrossing qualities captivate the reader, bind them up in living branches of wonder and mystery, and keep them guessing long after the book is finished. What you have here is a journey that can't be missed, a trip that must be taken. Pack your things and prepare to enter a world of dreams, myths, and legends where Robert Holdstock is the grandiose, fate weaving master."
2,puzzle2012,"pages were not good folds and pen and pencils marking. Disappointing for the price.Not a quality, nor a good buy for the price."
3,Cheap Teakettle,"It feels so light and the material feels cheap. I tried to get the sticker off the bottom and was able to wash it off. However, just holding it against the sink, I made a dent in it. Feels like thin cheap aluminum that is very delicate. I kind of regret paying eleven dollar for it. Made in Indonesia (not sure if that makes it better or worst). This is something you can buy for less than six dollars are some flea market. Better yet you'll probably find something that would hold up better.It works fine. I guess the thin construction would allow the water to boil faster than some thick steel."
1,Buyer Beware,"Be sure to read the product description--This teakettle is made of aluminum--bottom of pot is clearly aluminum. The name 'Copco' does not appear anywhere on the tag that accompanied the teakettle--tag states it is ROWOCO and 2006 Wilton Industires. If this is another name for Copco, I am not aware of it."
4,Super Chic,"I bought this based on the look alone. It is a beautiful kettle <3I'm not familiar with kettles, but the bottom of this seems to be quite thin. I've had no issues with it, it just made me a little nervous at first. This baby heats quickly and sings beautifully."
5,Carver Lives in This Book,"I've perused all of the critical work and this book outshines them all -- by at least 300 per cent. It's engaging, penetrating, well-developed and lucid, and written humanely no less, with much flair and elan. What a refreshing read, considering the arid critical deserts one often wanders. Nesset explores all of Carver's major volumes of stories, discussing selected stories in each while touching on others, and reflecting on Carver's poems here and there to good effect, using them as signposts and touchstones. If you've ever felt baffled by those bare, darkest stories, feel baffled no more. Carver's craft, his magic, is revealed in this book -- revealed from first page to last in that most illuminating, helpful, and respectful of ways."
5,Bravo! Bravo!,"I really enjoyed this wonderful book about a wonderfully delightful artist. I would recommend reading it if you are a Cezanne admirer, absolutely a wonderful book!"
5,Info Packed & Beautiful Cover,"This has been on my coffee table for a few years. I can't put it away, the cover is so beautiful! And it invites my guests at home to look through it. I read heavily on French Impressionism, particularly Cezanne. This is a excellent history and art book. And makes quite an impression."
4,A fitting tribute,"This book is certainly an appropriate tribute to the greatest comic strip of all time. It gives us a good dose of the best from each decade. My favorite aspect is the great margin notes by Charles Schulz, wherein he gives us fascinating background comments on the evolution of Peanuts and on ideas behind specific strips. My only regret, and the reason I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5, is that most of the Sunday samples of Peanuts are not in color here. They would have been in color originally, and I like seeing them that way. But this is certainly a terrific book to own, and I highly recommend it."
1,Peanuts a Golden Celebration,I have not received this book to date.. All of the others ordered in the Peanuts collection have arrived.
5,"Thank you Charles Schulz, and please get well.","After being a Peanuts for most of my 29 years, I can guarantee that this book will have a special place on my bookshelf. This book is a great history of Charlie Brown, the gang and my favorite, Snoopy (being a golfer, I have to like someone who has qualified for the Masters as often as he has). I know I'll be sharing this book with my young nieces as they like the Peanuts too. On a serious note, my thoughts and prayers are with Charles Schulz during his battle with colon cancer."
4,A great trip down memory lane,"I was about five or six when I first watched Underdog. Until I bought this tape, I hadn't seen it in over twenty years.The animation is bad.The lines are horrible.The plots are insipid.But the trip down memory lane was priceless. If you are a nostalgia buff and want to relive a part of your childhood, this tape is for you."
5,It's not only for children,What a nice seasonal book to have at such a great price. A book that will stand the test of time.
3,Problems with receiving product from outside supplier...,"""A Blue Dog Christmas"" is a great little book - it also comes with a blue dog Christmas ornament. The problem was not with the book, but with the supplier of the book. It came from an outside supplier, not Amazon directly. I ordered it in time to receive by Christmas (to give as a gift). It never arrived, although my credit card had been charged. Amazon provided me with the supplier's email so I could email her directly. Through many emails, the book was reorderd, and I eventually received it mid-January. It was not a good experience. I would suggest that you be cautious when ordering from Amazon, if it involves an outside supplier."
2,A Weber should be better,"I've had an old Weber for 15 years - still works well! However, as it was getting too small for my growing needs and starting to show its age, I ""upgraded"" to this model.The new one has more bells and whistles - I do love the smoking burner/box combo. The rest of the features are nice too. However, this thing is almost impossible to get to 500 degrees to sear a steak or do some other high-temp cooking! It runs through a tank of propane in just a couple of serious days of cooking and once you're at less than 3/4 tank, don't bother with high heat - it's not there!On the other hand - very few flare-ups and mid/low temp cooking is great."
2,damaged goods,"Unfortunately, when I opened the shipping box, the lid of the grill was dented so I refused the shipment and sent it back."
5,"Great band makes great music, that simple.","One of the most overlooked bands of the past decade would have to be Better Than Ezra. All three of their previous albums are classic by a band that mixes rock, funk, and soul, but does not become dorks while doing it. Closer shows of their New Orleans roots and is overall in one word fun. The true gift of BTE is how the album is woven so correctly with a mix of upbeat danceable numbers to the ballad that pulls your soul out to the floor. If nothing else this album is made great by the track ""Get You In."" This tune is a soulful song of longing that is by far one of the best tracks of the year. This is a great album for driving down the interstate (""Rollin'""), to remembering the feeling that a song can feel like it lasts a ""lifetime."" Please pick this up!"
5,Better Than Ever,"I have followed this band from the beginning and their musical evolution has taken a rise that should be recognized. This release is more commercial, but shows that this band has what it takes to keep current with the ever changing times.If you like an alt-rock CD that you can throw in the car and drive on a beautiful afternoon, this is it. It is so full of hooks and driving rhythms that you could almost think it was a greatest hits album. The song ""Extra Ordinary"" is hot on the charts and radio, the rest of the CD follows suit.I highly recommend this set of tunes for the beach, the road, or for a good house cleaning. It moves!"
2,Right About One Thing,"I just listened to the album for the first time. After their last attempt to follow the mainstream, I was hoping that they would not try and follow the latest trends and just play. But once again I was let down. Dance music is all the rave with the kids so what does BTE do, they include a DJ on their very cheesey popr record. I once thought that they were a good band. Now I realize they are just a band trying to stay on the radio. And most of the time, the radio is no place for a good band to be."
4,BTE DOESN'T GET CLOSER TO BETTER BUT A VERY GOOD EFFORT,"Better Than Ezra have arrived with ""Closer"". Which is a very good piece of work, but definitely not their best.They transform into a new and different sound here, but sometimes doesn't fit them.Songs like ""Juarez"" and ""I Do"" get lost in translation. The songs that are definitely standouts are ""Sincerely, Me"", ""Closer"" and ""Lifetime"".Kevin Griffin is in fine vocal form, production is top quality, this is a very good album. But artists that have been trying to refresh themselves is where I give BTE credit at least they are trying something new, even if the shoe doesn't fit ALL the time.Still a recommended buy, just some songs are lost on this CD."
2,Closer is not close enough,"I hate to give a weak review for a BTE album because they are one of my favorite bands. However, Closer doesn't come close to HDYGG, Friction Baby and Duluxe (it does surpass Artifakt, which thankfully--for the sake of the band and fans--was not released commercially). HDYGG is a hard album to surpass, and I never tire of listening to it. Closer, however, has only one really strong song (""Briefly""), and maybe two or three catchy, but forgettable tunes. BTE is a great band to see live."
5,The Best Ezra Yet!,"I have all four of BTE's albums, and I've got to say that this one is the best (with Deluxe a very close second.) This album has some catchy tunes you'll find yourself singing through out the day. The collaboration with DJ swamp adds a funky edginess to their pop rock music. Listen to this CD all the way through once, and you'll be hooked. There's not a single dud on this record. Do yourself a favor, and buy this CD!"
4,Almost but not quite...,"Some of the songs sound a bit too 'popish' for me yet there are still some strong performers such as 'A Lifetime' which has great lyrics such as ""three and half minutes felt like a lifetime"". 'A Lifetime' reminds me a lot of 'Summertime', it has that same nostalgic feel to it. 'Sincerely Me' is a fun, romantic song about a break-up. It puts a nice spin on life's little neuroses. 'Get You In' is one of my favorites. It has a soulful almost blues-like sound to it. 'Closer', 'Briefly' and 'I Do' are songs I feel best reflect the deep sound that BTE is capable of. I'm sad to say that none of the cuts on this CD equal the passion, intensity or greatness of 'Live Again', 'At The Stars', 'Rarely Spoken' or 'Beautiful Mistake'. In conclusion this CD is far better than a lot of pop candy albums out there today but not as wonderful as I had hoped it would be."
5,Best Album of 2001,"I went to see Better than Ezra at the Pageant in St. Louis, Mo a year ago, and I have been hooked since. I've made it to 5 shows this year, and this review is coming from a hardcore Ezralite. I truely think that this is their best effort in the studio, the album flows smoothly, is very lyrically deep and is a joy to listen to to. From emotional songs like ""A Lifetime"", to celebrations of life like ""I Do"" monumental songs span the whole disc. ""Briefly"", ""Closer"", and ""Rolling"" are also some of my favorite cuts off this album. I think that they finally got a happy medium sound inbetween Friction, Baby's alternative rock, and the sonic experimentation of ""HDYGG"". You seriously can't go wrong if you choose this album, it's the most inspired rock effort of 2001."
4,What can I say---Another great album,"I don't know how they do it, but BTE never fails to come out with great material. Although I believe How Does Your Garden Grow is their best work, Closer is an album that eloquently shows their evolution as a band. They have never been afraid to experiment, especially with their last album. I wish that more bands would use the piano. I have never seen another artist or band use it in so many different forms. They continue to do this in Closer, especially in Rollin, which is my personal favorite. The song is catchy, buy not in a cliche pop kind of way. Griffin's angelic voice shines in every song. BTE has never written for the people, which is one of the many things I love about them. Their songwriting clearly comes from THEM and their experiences. Closer is no exception."
3,Not Practical for the In-House Project Manager,"Project Management Nation (PMN) is an in-depth guide to the practicing IT project manager working for a consultant firm. The book is filled with great detail of work to be done throughout the lifecycle of a project. The concern is that the book is clearly geared towards project managers that deal outside of a core company, and instead make their money as consultants. The book lacks examples, and starts off with many great quotes by Sun Tzu and around the third chapter they just disappear. A lack of examples in the details along with many grammatical errors in the book dropped my overall rating. If you are looking to read this book, give it a once over, then go back thru the lifecylce of the project you are managing and highlight the key points for you."
4,Project Management Nation Review,I am an Investment Banker. We specialize in Project Finance with a commercial property bias. This book is great in helping me understand the basic project management techniques. All to often we are in the dark as far as client project progress is concerned. This book has greatly assisted me in being able to ask pertinent project progress questions.This book should be prescribed reading material for undergraduate project management courses - If it is not already prescribed.
1,lame,"Don't waste your money. Just because it says Britannica does not make it good. Extremely disappointed. Very little information, 2 video clips. Give me a break. I was ripped off."
5,Its Tight as H*ll,"This song is tight as h_ll, but I never know that such a great song had come out on single. I only saw the video a while ago...so it just sneaked out apparently. If you love any of these artists, this is a must have cd."
2,Foundations of Parasitology,"The binding of the book was in poor condition and there was a page that was actually tapped together that had been ripped in half. As I was already into the semester, I chose to accept the imperfections of the text. The price was a bit steep for the quality of the book."
4,Just ordered it-now adding ingredients,"Here is what's in it:Sulfur 9C; Teucrium Marum, Viola Odorata 1X, 3X, 6X, 9X, 12X; Podophyllum 4X, 6X; Natrum Muriaticum 6X; Chelidonium Majus 4X. In a base of: Syzygium Aromaticum (Cloves), Wormwood (Artemisia Absinthium), Black Walnut/Green Hull, Red Clover Blossoms, Azadirachta Indica, Pomegranate Root Bark, Chinchona Bark, Sesame Seeds, Papain, L-Arginine, L-Ornithine, Kamala Powder, Gelatin, Rice Flour, and Dextrose.I just ordered it, so I'm not sure how it works, but it was recommended in Prescription for Nutritional Healing by Balch, so I trust it's a reputable and great product. Will update when finished with the cleanse. You have to get two bottles for one full month of treatment."
1,Ineffective,"I checked the evidence that homeopathy can cure parasitic infestations. There is none. No evidence whatsoever.All this product is, is sugar pills.Don't waste your money."
1,Like a Toy,This junk pile broke on the third load.The worm gear (plastic) sheard off. Try to get a replacement... No way!Try to get your money back...No way!Don't buy the PIG!
3,Big Cat Has Worm Problem,"We use this mixer quite a lot for our home projects -- repairing and installing foundations and laying stone patios and walls. this is not an industrial type mixer. If the mixer isn't perfectly level, it wobbles a lot. It drinks cooking oil like there is no tomorrow. We have gone through 3 worm gears and one yoke bushing. We have had no trouble obtaining these parts from the manufacturer -- they arrived in a couple days and they are easy to install. This was cheaper for us than to rent. It was handy when needed. I would buy it again."
1,Junk,Never worked right from the first try. Finally got it adjusted so the load was evenly supported on the rollers and it worked for one or two times. Always had to start it with zero load and gradually add the water and mix. I wasted more time on it than it cost. Don't buy it.
1,"Avoid, Avoid, AVOID!!!","Cheapness of quality is remembered LONG after cheapness of price is forgotten! This mixer is astoundingly poorly engineered! It uses vegetable oil to lubricate the SOFT PLASTIC drive gear. Well, I have NEWS for you, vegetable oil turns into GLUE after sitting over a period of time, plugging the lubrication tube and gumming up the gears! I haven't found ANY suitable solvent to dissolve this ""glue."" Then when you run it, the drive worm gear strips out in a few minutes. I haven't found ANY suitable solvent to dissolve this ""glue."" A new drive gear, if you can find one, costs 1/6th of the complete price of the unit!!! Seems to me that a part that costs this much as a percentage of the total cost of the unit should be MUCH BETTER!!! I think Red Lion has PURPOSEFULLY done this to pad their bottom line....selling overpriced drive gears!!!AVOID this mixer at ALL COSTS!!!"
2,Don't buy,"Didn't last long. Plastic gear gave out fast and I'm not a contractor, used it only occasionally. The Husky at the Home Depot (or wherever) is much better. You been warned!"
4,You can get parts for this mixer,I bought this mixer 5 years ago and worked great till I let someone use it and the worm gear went.You can get parts for this mixer.Call 1-800-575-1935 the gear cost 20.00 not to bad.Happy mixing!
5,StarMariner,"I really liked this series. I found it every bit as good as Dynasty or Dallas and don't understand why it never stayed on air. It has the perfect formula, passion, romance, intrigue and rivalry between two wealthy families--the Philips and Sommers. It is a great continuation of the book Trade Winds by Janet Quinn Harkin."
4,mediore bang for the buck..,"While it's a nice sub in most respects, (tightness, musicality, deep bass), it's hard for me to justify the $500 price tag for a small jump in quality over the subs built into my Polk Rt1000i powered towers. It plays down to about 20Hz but it's the gain knob must be controlled for almost every CD I pop in because of how boomy it can sound when turned too high. Plus, it's a behemoth of a sub taking up over 2 ft^3. Full controls and and nice x-over, though. 4 stars."
2,Too much audience participation to be called music.,"I ordered this album with interest in the music, but whoever mastered the recording has overdone the screaming crowd. The 120 decibel background noise is equal to the force of the music, making this album not very enjoyable to listen to. I have other live albums, but none that sound like 10,000 people are on the stage with the band. Too much!!"
5,Fast paced and Exciting,"The album is recorded digitally re-mixed with the fast paced accordion in the background, as it was when Eddie Gonzales appeared in concert at Tejano Texas in San Antonio back on August 29, 1999."
3,Glitter tights,These were at least a size and 1/2 smaller than tights you buy at Macy's or any other department store. They were beautiful but I couldn't wear them.
4,Book was OK,I understand why the book wasn't popular. I purchased it because my dogs are named after two of the characters. Has an interesting history behind the book but not on any MUST read list.
4,Interesting Culture Study,"Living somewhat near Vancouver, Canada, where there are whole sections of the city and suburbs with Indian (or Chinese) immigrants, I found this movie to be quite interesting. We hear often about the struggles the kids have with blending into the American/Canadian culture and with their parents who want them to retain the old culture from their home countries. This movie is really about just such a struggle with an Indian brother and sister, and with their childhood neighbor (and his boorish brother). The reason I downgraded it one star is because it seemed that the American kids adopted the Indian culture more than the Indian kids adopted the American culture. [I believe if one immigrates to a different culture, one should adopt that culture, not expect the `natives' to adapt to your foreign culture.]"
5,Extraordinary yet so underground.,"You may not even heard of this guy but he is like madlib's brother. They both emerged out of the same area together. It's just that KanKick aka Kan Zulu stays on the DL nowadays and has been making ""limited"" edition releases (have no idea why). Thank god for YouTube right? Thats the only place one could discover KanKick now and any other real underground artists. His beats are definitely something to be heard if you're a Madlib fan. Over the years KanKick has only released limited copies of his work and has been getting rarer and rarer. I was fortunate to find a brand new ""From Artz Unknown"" & ""Acid Massive Musical"" CDs for cheap and copped his ""From Artz Unknown"" 3LP limited edition.Discography: Kankick*"
4,Solid album from member of Loot Pack,"Kankick makes a solid effort on this album. There is a nice mixture of jazzy underground beats and hardcore underground beats. A few of the stand-out tracks are, ""Kan's Intro"", ""The Finer Things"", Kanstrumental 4 and 5. I'm more of an intstrumental guy myself, but I dont mind hearing some lyrics over a nice beat. This album is to be listened to while smoked up....no seriously....it says it right on the case......im not joking. If your a fan of madlib, ynq, or five deez then you should definitely pick this album up for your collection of great underground music."
1,Typical McKuen,"This is typical cranked out Rod McKuen poetry. Written in 1973, hailed by contemporaries as ""DEEP"". The only people who considered these lines to be deep were imbibing in the recreational drugs of the day. Consider, my nine year old wrote three poems for me after browsing this book. None of my friends could tell the home-grown child-produced poems from the deep thought out musings of Mr. McKuen.For a very good laugh please get a copy, sit down with a glass of wine and some close friends, and read these out loud!"
3,duped,"The silver ware is nice, but beware, the Amazon Website says that it is 18/10 silver, and it is actually 18/0. I was worried about the ""Continental Size"" of the silverware, and it is just fine. The size of the pieces aren't at all too big."
2,Disappointed with knives,"My mother looked for a long time to replace her existing set, and fell in love with the Camlynn pattern. After about a month, just about all the knives started to show rust spots in the groove.It was not the dishwasher detergent that was the problem. She does have hard water, but that does not explain the rust. She wasbrokenhearted, but returned the set for a refund."
2,Poor quality control,"I purchased three sets of this flatware. After the first washing, 2/3 of the butter knives came out of the dish washer with rust spots. Paid to return the defective pieces to Oneida and received replacements. Started hand washing the knives (even though they say dishwasher safe)and still got rust spots on some of them. We have switched to a different brand (Gourmet Settings) and have not had any problems. My advice: Oneida's quality control is not what it used to be. Look at a different brand."
2,Really nice pattern but not stainless.,This set is really nice I love the pattern but it is not stainless. My son commented that this my new set looks older than my 15 year old set I gave to him to take to his college home. Not good.
1,not a happy camper,"I researched the internet thoroughly for a good set of everyday flatware with a sensible price. Finally bought the 53 piece set of Camlynn by Oneida. Out of the box it was nice and heavy, pretty and washed well. After putting it in the drawer several days later, I tried one of the knives. It could not cut an english muffin in half without some serious effort. What's this about, I pondered. No serrated edge at all on the knives. So back to Bed Bath and beyond I'll go tomorrow to get my refund. Can't believe it! Back to square one. Oneida, are your reading this??"
3,Universal?,"I purchased this to mount my front plate on my 2004 Subaru Forester, it didn't fit. The holes were spaced just close enough where it wouldn't fit unless it was off center. For the price I'm not going to bother returning it, but just know that it won't fit everything. Also, the holes for the license plate screws are pretty massive, I had to buy special screws just to hold the plate, since the typical plate screws have too small of a diameter."
4,Removes all those fine lines,This is great at removing all those fine lines under your eyes. Definitely looks better after use. Just wish it would do more for the dark circles.
1,Full of parabens!,"NO NO NO! This product is terrible and has parabens in it:Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Butylparabeni think it has every paraben there is in that little over-priced bottle. check out all the other toxic preservatives in it as well.Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacryladipate-2, BHT, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrasodium EDTA.STAY AWAY. Made my skin look terrible and rad"
2,No instructions,"Good stand after 3 days of trying to put it together with nothing but picture on box to look at, and you still won't be able to put it together. You will have to get a hold of Sherlock Holmes to figure it out."
1,Poor Quality Seminar Footage,"I thought this video had very poor quality footage from a seminar of Soke Mabuni. The camera operator did not focus on Soke Mabuni, but rather on the participants, zooming in and out and wobbling around. Very dissapointed and suprised it was on the market."
3,Overall the game is amazing,"as stated the game is amazing, controls are great, gameplay is not easy but not impasable, the camera is well lets just say they are there.The game is to repetitive; too much back and forth, so many ""Mini Games"" the story mode is getting over powered, the GTA (Grand Theaf Auto) theam should stay with GTA format.overall an amzing game"
2,"Good graphics, bad game","I really don't like the game, the missions are boring, it has no intro, no history, nothing, just an spider jumping around and walking everywhere and nobody cares, I should buy Grand Turismo instead."
3,"Fun, but slow","Its a fun game, just the mechanics are a little bit weird, making certain situations in the game alot harder than they should be! But overall a game I could sit down for a few hours and still enjoy myself"
5,GENTLE JOHN,"John Hartford's recent death was a great loss to American music. Seldom has there been a singer/songwriter who has remained truer to his roots and more focused on his musical mission - in John's case to sing and write the very finest bluegrass music that he could. This is one of his best records. At first listen to ""Piece of My Heart,"" a song burned in everyone's psyche in Janis Joplin's searing version, you might think, Whoa, what's this guy trying to do? But after hearing John's version a few times, you begin to realize that the quieter pain expressed in his take of the song is no less valid than Janis's cosmic heartbreak. Highlights include ""Piece,"" ""I'm Still Here,"" ""No Expectations,"" and the title tune. If you like the best in bluegrass music, you can't go wrong with this CD, which includes two fine bonus tracks."
5,"I'm still here, tells the John Hartford Story!","Rounder releases an album that gives out with ""Ultimate Bluegrass"" from the best of the best John Hartford...with a strong line-up backing our hero.Let's take a look at this talented group of musicians ~ Jack Clement(guitar/dobro/ukulele)...Mark Howard(lead guitar)...Mark O'Connor(guitar/mandolin/fiddle)...Roy M.

(...) .Total Time: 41:27 on 12 Tracks ~ Flying Fish/Rounder 18964-0289-2 ~ (2001)"
5,Vintage Johnny,"Always liked John Hartford, and love playing this one of sentimental old favorites and some rowdy ones. Always makes my heart lighter."
4,"Bill nye makes architecture fun, too.","Bill Nye takes science subjects and makes them fun by breaking a topic down and showing lots of little aspects in different ways. He's often corny, but able to laugh at himself, and moves from item to item rapidly enough it would be hard to get bored.In Archetecture he emphasises plans, foundations, form and function, infrastructure, and weight bearing.My kids, 3, 6, 10 and 13 all love Bill Nye, and the older ones have an excellent grasp of many different science concepts (and a real love of science) thanks to him. You can often take these out in VHS or DVD from your local library, but when they come up for sale at a reasonable price we buy them, as my kids watch them over and over again."
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"This is the worst textbook I've ever read. The author fails to cover the matterial either from a theoretical or a practical engineering point of view. Instead the book seems to be mostly a long listing of facts and terms. It is sort of like a bad survey paper on steroids. It lacks useful examples. Some of the examples that are included consist of things like tables of values without any indication of how these values are used in the context of the problem.To top it all off, some of the listed 'facts' seem to be just plain wrong. Some of the formulas appear to me to be erroneous. I base this on what seems to be the intent of the formulas in question. It is not possible to say for sure since no examples using these formulas are given. Mistyped formulas are to be expected in any text, however, the author saying of NP-Complete problems that ""the NP stands for 'non-polynomial'"" is an example of an unacceptable error."
3,A review,"I do not have any affinity with either cooking or New Orleans, nor have I read any of PZB's previous works. Then, one might ask, what on Earth compelled you towards this book? Put simply: interesting characters, humorous (but realistic) dialogue and the prerequisite of clearly written prose.If it weren't for me reading PZB's blog, I wouldn't have ever noticed this book. I wasn't expecting anything revolutionary, though, just an amusing read. Hence the rating."
2,Click n' Go,"I had a hard time hooking this up to my daughters stroller. I'm a coffee drinker, and most times my coffee spills over because its kind of weak on the bottom. Also when walking, it makes a shaking sound, its funny. I wouldn't buy again."
2,Not for chunky stroller bars,"This cup holder seems to only work with a stroller bar less than 3/4"" in diameter. It will not fit on the handlebar of my Phil & Ted Sport stroller, with it's chunky foam covered handlebar. The click n' go feature allows for 4 different positions for the cup holder in relation to the mounting bracket: level with the cup holder, tilted 45 degrees in either direction and 90 degrees (for example, if you were positioning it on an upright bar). It was a great price, so I wish it would have worked. It's not worth sending it back, so I will try it on my umbrella stroller which has narrower bars."
1,Does not work,This product is not easy to install and unstable even when it is secured to the stroller frame. The cup holder easily twists off the hook that attaches to the stroller frame. We decided to invest in another brand after our second use after spilling coffee all over the floor....
2,lowest quality cup holder as of yet,"I purchased this cup holder from a toys r us store for $6 one day just to return it the very next day. This cup holder lacks everything that I was looking for in a cup holder. It does not swivel to avoid spills, it is made of thin plastic pieces causing rattling of the cup holder, it does not support heavy cups well because of thin support pieces. The only thing this item had going for it was the price. I see that it is selling for more on Amazon so I will take away that plus and give it a 2 rating for doing a half way job on some cups and baby bottles. I would look elsewhere. I am embarrassed to even consider placing this thing on my stroller."
1,"CHEAP, USELESS",IT DOESN'T HOLD THE WEIGHT OF A WATER BOTTLE; EITHER IT OPENS AT THE BOTTOM OR TURNS TO SPILL IT. TERRIBLE PRODUCT; CHEAP AND USELESS...WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN OR RECOMMEND.
2,ok!,"If you think about it...It's a good Kids movie. It doesn't show right or wrong, It's nothing like The book, it has nothing to do with any of the other movies, The 3 Musketeers cheat when they fence, D'Artagnan's a punk.....What am I saying? Well, it's a good laugh! Maybe you could do Mst3k over it!To say a good thing about it, the acting is ok."
1,"Good comedy, TERRIBLE disc","THIS IS NOT A WIDESCREEN FILM.It has black bars hard-coded into it on all four sides on an HDTV, making the video size barely more than half a normal widescreen film. That wouldn't be so bad if the video quality itself weren't terrible. This is beyond a doubt one of the worst transfers I've ever seen--essentially no better than the VHS version, which is at least properly matted for a 4:3 television. This edition is unsuitable for any TV, HD or otherwise. It's a complete travesty.The movie itself is a great 90s comedy--fun and silly. It's not a serious adaptation of the novel. It's unfortunate it has been ruined by the DVD producer."
2,Why bother when the Richard Lester versions are available?,"Sad to say, this version is everything you'd expect once it's been Disney-fied. It's very pretty and they hired entertaining actors, but an adult story of love and revenge has turned into pattycakes in pseudo-France. I cannot recommend paying money for this when the Richard Lester-directed version of this story is available. Check it out! (It's the one with Michael York, Christopher Lee, Richard Chamberlain, Oliver Reed, Raquel Welch....)"
5,Disney's 3 musketeers,Set in France during the reign of young King Louis whose disbanded musketeers have discovered a plot to end his life. 3 musketeers + a young man from the country save the day!
3,Fun but disposable,"We purchased this film largely because my wife had fond memories of watching this film in her youth and we had just finished reading Dumas' Three Musketeers and wanted to compare. Here is what we found out.1) This film has nothing to do with the book. The names and places might be the same, but the story and characters are completely different. I wonder if the screenwriters even bothered to read the book.2) While a Disney film and rated PG, it is not appropriate for little children. The scenes in the catacombs and the multiple inuendos made me wonder why the film wasn't rated PG-13.But for some bubble-gum teenage movie fun, this film does an adequate job. If you like lightweight action adventure, then Disney's The Three Musketeers will fit the bill."
4,Just for fun...,"The Three Musketeers may not follow the book but it is a fun movie with some witty dialog. Don't think, just watch and enjoy."
2,Michael Wincott and Oliver Platt get the stars,"Otherwise I would have definitely put no stars at all next to this film. Awful! Just awful! The only reason I own this (mis)interpretation of the greatest adventure series in the world is because Michael is in it. And even his character is all wrong! Whoever heard of Rochefort having only one eye? Well, yeah, this is a common American view of it... Oliver Platt is the only other saving grace as Porthos. Chris O'Donnell is horrible as one of the coolest characters in literature. And Charlie Sheen as Aramis? Who cast this thing? Oh, and how the story was botched... Please, if you love the book, don't waste your time with this film!"
3,"Entertaining, but not true to the book.","I rented this movie because I loved the book. I was very disappointed in the movie because it is so different. The plot is completely wrong, as are the characters - the Cardinal is not completely evil, the queen and king do not love each other, Athos does not beg Milady's forgiveness, nor does he feel any desire to do so... you get the idea. However, this can be a thoroughly entertaining movie if you don't expect it to be a perfect representation of the book. It includes action, romance, humor, and drama, and like all good Disney movies, has a happy ending. Enjoy, but read the book after you've finished the movie!"
4,some story lines left out,I loved this version of the three musketeers although they left a lot out of the oringinal story....like the love affair that the queen was having with the duke of buckingham and how the diamond studs were stolen and how the king wanted the queen to wear them to his birthday celebration all that good stuff that made the story really go.
5,(promises to be) a timeless classic !,"This is a very entertaining and wholesome swashbuckling adventure-comedy which promises to entertain viewers both young and old. I remember watching this when it first came out in theaters, and I ordered the DVD as soon as it became available. Try watching this and ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" immediately after to get a feeling of ""continuity"" of sorts as well as an interesting juxtaposition the two films' respective interpretations of Aramis, Porthos, Athos and Dartagnan.I'm glad that more recent DVD releases such as this one are getting more and more ""pumped up"" (e.g. with added features such as featurettes, music videos and the like). Pretty soon (hopefully) we might be seeing standard-fare features such as DTS sound and interactive / on-screen bells and whistles (ala Matrix!). In a nutshell : BUY THIS! It's worth it..."
5,A very entertaining and funny movie; great for the family!,"I REALLY enjoyed watching this movie! Chris O'Donnell was SO cute with his hair that color. But Keifer Sutherland, Charlie Sheen and Oliver Platt were all lookin' good, too. There's a lot of action, suspense, plenty of funny lines, and, for you guys, some pretty girls, too. Even though the story of this movie doesn't really follow the book very much, it's still a very good movie to watch. I especially like it because there's no fowl language in it. I get so tired of wasting my money renting movies, then stopping them after 5 or 10 minutes because they have so much filthy language. I'm not going to spend my hard-earned money on listening to filthy language. Thanks, and I hope you enjoy the movie, too!"
5,The Three Musketeers,"Walt Disney productions could not have cast this movie more perfectly. Keifer Sutherland as Athos, was perfect. The character is just as serious as the actor. It was as if the part was written for him. Chris O'Donnell as Dartanion is perfect. When this movie was made he was the carefree, young actor who was in the business to have fun & fulfill his dreams. The character, Dartanion, was so like Chris in real life you couldn't help but fall in love with him. Charlie Sheen as the playboy, priest protoge, on the racey side. Talk about practically describing his real life. Oliver Platt as the pirate, Disney couldn't have found anyone more perfect. Tim Curry as the Cardinal, perfect villain.I really liked how they blocked the extra vicious scenes and kept blood out of the movie so that my children (at the time the movie was made were 8, 6 & 3) were able to watch it without getting nightmares. Each one had their own favorite. We still watch it over & over & over 15 years later. :)"
4,This is the lighter Disney version,"Not as ""bawdy"" and therefore the choice for family viewing of the different 3 Musketeer movies available. Even as a remake, this has a fresh and breezy feel to it."
2,The worst DVD transfer of all time!,"I liked this movie on VHS. It is a no brainer. A way to pass an hour or so without trying to think to much into it.So when the DVD came out I bought it...Big Mistake. I now have the only DVD in a colection of over 400 which doubles as a frisby.The transfer in letterbox fomat is so bad, that some of the sword scenes look more like they are holding weapons from a 70's vido game, pixelated....Don't buy this DVD it [bites]."
4,The Three Musketeers,"First of all, the actors are have perfectly played these roles. The King and Queen are a bit young looking, but I suppose that it's the times. The plot flows well, with a past for one particular musketeer, and a future for our wanna-be musketeer hero (who, typically, is the hero), and of course, romance. The villain, though, was perhaps my favorite part of all of it, because he was played so evilly and so well. A slight drawback would be, I think, that things move just a bit too quickly, and some scenes and characters don't have enough time to develop. But it is an enjoyable movie, overall."
1,Hollyweird history rewrite of a Dumas classic,"Alexandre Dumas invented the genre of historical fiction by creating plausible characters in an authentic historical period. This Hollywood absurdity of a plot has Cardinal Richelieu scheming to usurp the throne of France. While the action is intended to carry this film the preposterous plot makes a mockery of the genre. The characters are not historically plausible nor is the story the least bit believable for anyone who understands anything of the period. This is unfortunate. The cast (Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Tim Curry) offered great potential for a rousing remake. The screen writers however acted as if they were ditzy teenagers from valley high who believed that history began in 1965. ""Bill and Ted remake The Musketeers"" This film was a big disappointment."
4,The Three Musketeers,"This is a great old favourite. I loved it years ago and I still love it now. The storyline is fun and exciting and the setting is great. Some of the characters seem a little corny a few years on. But on the whole, very entertaining."
1,Horrible....,"I suppose that I can't expect a movie with the word ""Disney"" on it to even pretend to try to follow an original story. But for God's sake! This movie is awful! Why would you pass up such a solid plot such as the book had in favor of the boring thread pushed in this wretched adaption. While Curry gives an above-average performance, the rest of the cast is weak. Sheen looks like a chump (as always), and Chris O'Donnell obviously has no idea of How d'Artangan is supposed to act. This movie is not even worth renting...much less buying. Pass it up!"
1,terrible,"this was one of the worst films i have had the misfortune to watch ever!the plot is weak, the actors act like school children and the actual story line has gone far astrey from the real book. all in all it was a complete, boring dissapointment and i suggest that this film should be thrown in the nearest garbage truck."
1,Gagging on Disneyfied version,"This is the absolute worst rendition of the Dumas story ever filmed. Especially pathetic are the acting skills, or lack thereof, of the four musketeers themselves. Even worse, if possible, is the sneering, leering Tim Curry in a role he should never been given. Avoid this dog at all costs. See instead, the versions starring real actors such as Reed, Chamberlain, York, Heston, and many others."
4,Not the best,"i used to think this was the best movie in the world..........but I have found ones that go along with the book better, while this, though funny, has almost no connection with the book beyond characters."
1,Wish I could give it O stars,"The cast seems ludicrously out of place in this movie--only Anwar is partially believable and her part is slight.If you wish to see an interesting an authentic three musketeers, look for AISN B00006LPC5 , a 1972 version that is incredible."
2,Nothing like the book-This should have been classified as a comedy!,"This version does not resemble the book at all. It has the musketeers being disbanded; Milady's name is changed; Richelieu attempts to make a treaty with Buckingham and attempts to have the king shot at a birthday celebration; etc. It resembles the book in nothing except that MOST of the character's names remain the same. However, if you want to watch a comedy it is great. There are some very funny moments, although most of the movie is so dumb as to be entertainingly funny. The sets and costumes are great and so are the fighting scenes. However, it is very stupid and should have been made as a comedy. There has never been a good version made of this classic adventure story."
1,Haven't recieved the movie,I have yet to recieve the DVD so I can't review anythin I haven't gotten yet
3,Where is the Blu Ray?,"This is one of my all time 5 star favorites. But this Disney treasure will not upconvert on a 16x9 HDTV, so you get a dbl letterbox with the movie playing in the center of your screen surrounded by an ocean of black. Come on Disney, release this bad boy in Blu Ray so I can buy the damn thing and see it in all it's glory!"
3,"Campy, but fun","Well, OK. They scrapped the plot, butchered French history, and completely, utterly miscast D'Artagnan.The whole king and queen being all sweetly in love was pretty nauseating, and the Cardinal's plots positively laughable. I suppose it's a bit much to ask Disney to clarify to kids that a man can be a manipulative, unscrupulous politician and not be *evil.*But it was kind of amusing, and most of the casting was decent...perhaps in a serious movie, the actors could have done better.Tim Curry was lovely...no Charleton Heston, but in a better movie he might have rivaled him. Charlie Sheen OK, but his acting was, IMO, forgivable because he looked nice. Kiefer Sutherland great. Michael Wincott...well...;) I plead the Fifth. Rebecca de Mornay fine, but not great. Chris O'Donnell positively nauseating, though IMO not as annoying as Michael York. Give me Gabriel Byrne any day."
3,"Unlike the book, unlike history","The movie on its own isn't bad. I'll admit that I've watched it several times and I'm always entertained. But I'm greatly annoyed by a couple of things. One is that about the only thing the movie has in common with the book is the same characters. I could even forgive that, at least somewhat, because movies always change the book. But the movie give a completely misleading view of French history. Richelieu was not evil, and he certainly would never try to kill the king. Even if that somehow happened, it wouldn't make him the next king! Louis had a brother and plenty of other relatives who would have been next in line for the throne. This was the aspect of the movie that bothered me the most. Cardinal Richelieu was a complex human being, and reducing him to a one-dimensional villain is a travesty."
3,It's okay,"I bought this movie so my kids could see it, and after about the first 1/2 hour they said, ""dad, take this movie out, it's too boring"" I liked it, but my kids didn't."
4,best of the best,"alright,the movie doesn't follow the book,but that's not a great problem if you wan't to see a great movie(sorry,my English is not so good,because i am an dutch-man) I have seen the movie a fiew weeks ago,and recorded it on a tape. Now i have seen it already 3 times!! Why??because it is an movie whit great action and a nice story. The fights are nice and the stunts are nice,so the movie is nice. Don't argue about a book-story,but buy this movie and see for yourself....."
5,awesome!,"This movie is totally action packed with lots of funny scenes. It has a little bit of romance plus some irony. It's totally cool, in my opinion. Sutherland, Sheen, O'Donnell, Platt, and Curry are great in their places as Athos, Aramis, D'Artagnan, Porthos, and Richelieu. I sugest that if you haven't seen it already, you see it because it'll give you an awesome adventure you'll never forget. I know I can't forget it!"
2,Not Anamorphic 16X9,"FYI, this is not anamorphic and will not fit to your widescreen TV. Wait for a better release if that is important to you. Only rating the DVD release, not the movie."
1,Didn't think anyone still made DVD's like this anymore,"I'm not referring to the movie itself... It's the disc - it's double sided! Half the movie is on one side, and to see the rest of the movie...just turn the disc over. Really?!No way of knowing if Amazon was shipping some old, old, discs until they got to the ""single sided formats"" but if you get a double sided version, don't be surprised."
5,A Classic Tale,"This rendition of The Three Musketeers is by far my favorite! The dialogue is light, spontaneous, and funny. These four actors are at their best in this movie, including Charlie Sheen. Dear Charlie, what happened??"
4,Great Book,"My economics prof. assigned this book for a public policy class. I was a little put off at first by some grammatical and spelling deficiencies, but the problems went away and the more I read, the better the book got. Great coverage of the constitutionality of regulations and administrative laws, a short history of American regulation from the early Republic to the late 80's and early 90's, and a rundown of some economic theories of regulation. Some economic knowledge is necessary and there are a few graphs and tables of statistics. Great resource if you want some ammunition to take on your liberal friends and professors."
1,Not what I expected.,"I thought this puppet would really sing the songs. Instead it makes a somewhat irratating noise for each note. If you don't know what song it is ""singing"", it doesn't sound right because you have to know the beat or rhythm of the song. I have purchased a dog about a year ago that sings a love song by the Carpenters when you move the mouth it sings a phrase at a time. I guess I had different expectations for this little cat.On the Pros side - it is cute and a durable toy."
1,The Absent Plot Mystery,"This book was a terrible disappointment. It was my son's first ""Chapter Book"" and almost put him off reading forever. There is no plot, the premise is absurd and one cannot tell one character from another as they are so poorly developed. It was required summer reading for his school and I thought we'd never get through it.I had heard this was a wonderful series; perhaps we just chose the worst of the lot."
2,"No trouble, just a surprise at the end","It is a mystery in the sense that the children do not know wholeaves them messages,but that's about it all.Nothing is happening thatmakes the story really keep the reader in suspense."
1,Old Testament Hebrew,"This book was recommended to me by a pastor friend that really likes it. I have no knowledge of Hebrew and find Vine's Complete Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words to be much easier for me to use. I also like the Strong's system of categorizing words which Wilson's does not use. Had I seen Wilson's before I bought it, I would not have purchased the book."
4,Lovely water glasses,"These very heavy water glasses are perfect. We throw everything in the dishwasher, and as a consequence all our water glasses get that worn look very quickly. With these there is no temptation to put them through the cycle, so they stay pristine! I think they're great on a casual dinner table, and they're pretty effective for that after work gin & tonic if you only want to mix one for the night!"
2,Endwell ~Homeland Insecurity~,"Homeland Insecurity opens with up-tempo drumming and deep growls that feel like they head absolutely no where. The song is a wash of boredom with almost no diversions from the standard metalcore triplets and palm muted chords underneath and sadly, this album doesn't stray too far form the formula after that.The clean singing on this album is solid and some of the lead work during the choruses (""""A Taste of Everest"""") is solid but the band just never does anything new which seems to be a growing trend amongst Victory bands.If you've heard Still Remains, Silverstein or It Dies Today... you've pretty much heard everything this band has to offer now, sadly.To be honest, had they stayed mostly in the direction of their single """"Single and Loving It"""" the disc would have been much more enjoyable! Otherwise, you can pass on this one!"
3,"end well, well maby","Not a bad metal album,but a metal album maby on the more youthful side of the scene. Maby with a little more guidence from some experienced production and vets in the industry they could diversify speed of and heavy the sound a bit. you dont have to scream through a whole damn song to make a goddam point that your angst ridden. Music stucture was good. sound even. But i stop at three stars."
4,Descent album,"This is a good disc if you like the current punk/metal scene. Of course we all know real punk is dead, but this album mixes remnants of hardcore punk with new metal. Overall a good listen."
1,Painfully formulaic.,If your familiar with todays music then you've already heard this album a thousand times before.. and probably a lot better done. There is not an ounce of originality to be found on Endwell's debut. They seem content to pound you over and over with their formula of deep Atreyu-esque growlscreams alongside Hawthorn-esque singing. I think even people who live and breath this kind of music will have difficulty putting it anywhere but on the bottom of their list.Look elsewhere for your hardcore fix.. this ones nothing special.A few suggestions..Translating the Name - SaosinNuclear.Sad.Nuclear. - The #12 Looks Like YouBetween the Heart and the Synapse - The Receiving End of Sirens
5,I was riveted.,"A few of the reviewers have mentioned that the book contains nothing new. That may be the case for people who have studied the situation in depth or were there at the time. But lots of Americans, like me, only knew what they saw on the news or read in the papers. For us, the book is a real eye-opener with many surprises.I also disagree with the characterization of this book as ""dry."" I couldn't put it down. If the expository narrative bits weren't in there and the book consisted of the documents only, it might have been tiresome after a while. But whoever put this together added just enough background to maintain the sense of tension and gravity. It's very suspenseful--a neat trick considering the one thing everybody already knows is how the story ended."
5,History will not forget,"This book illustrates how one of the biggest country in the world has been controled and manipulated by a small group of people's greed for power. This book is banned in China. If this book is not true, why the Chinese government has to issue an order that any person who spreads this book in China will be executed?"
2,Nothing new.,"I only feel sorry for these who were killed by the government troops. Both sides should be condemned, the government and these student leaders. The Paper tells you nothing new."
4,A great introduction to scrapbooking,"This book offers many styles of scrapbooking for the golfer, cook, artist, etc. Although all graphics are in black and white, the charm of the scrapbooks illustrated still inspires."
4,"Good book, true to the first one.","This is a pretty good story. A little more romance than I expected, but well written. Although grown up, Pollyanna is still her normal optimistic self and her Aunt Polly is really exasperating sometimes. It's a book to read when you just want to relax."
4,Pollyanna the sequal,"Almost as good as the first. It was delightful after watching the movie over a dozen times, to find out what happens next. Although predictable, it was still a fun, light read."
3,Pollyanna Grows Up,Plllyanna Grows Up just wasn't what I quite expected. The camping trip seemed to drop off & I kinda lost interest at that point.
3,Pollyanna Grows Up,"This is 'Clean' reading! It would be very girl for Young Adults to read.It was a fun story but it skipped six years of Polyanna growing up!!Ms Porter delved into detail Polyanna's thirteenth year but other than stating she went to Europe for six years then returned to her home town. Granted, this would have been a very large book but, even better, it could have easily been made into two or more books, such as Anne of Green Gables.It was a delightful reminder of the much beloved story of ""Pollyanna."""
4,Liked it a lot!,I really liked this story. A very enjoyable read and fun continuation of a childhood favorite of mine. Would recommend it to others.
1,really low quality,"I saw these in a store, and nearly bought one. The leaf-shaped scale is a really nice improvement.But the lock spring pushes past the blade. It barely touches, and just springs right past, so the blade does not lock open.I tried 3 of them, and they were all in similar condition. One of them just barely catches the blade, but would fail with a light touch."
1,terrible item,"I read the directions and follwed them only to find it spewed water and almost burned my hand! It was also on the large size which would take up more space in packing than I anticipated. Did not like it at all.On trying to return the item,Amazon told me to call the manufacurer who in turn told me to call Amazon. This continued over and over again until I finally found someone at the Steamfast Steamer company who finally sent me a mailing label to send it back and receive my refund. So far, no refund! Meantime, I found a steamer at Target that is perfect."
1,bad product,"It just spews water in the vapor all the time, it just gets collected in the nozzle holes and drips down on your fabric, even if you put very little water in it. Also leaves stain no matter what type of water you use, distilled, drinking, ect. And it does in no way compare to and iron, there is not crispness to it. Just a product that has not been fully designed to work properly. I would not recommend it to anyone or ever buy one of these again."
4,Great item for small tasks.,This item was purchased for the occasional wrinkle remover needs that come up. Most of which were hobby related for my wife. The item performed as described and we are happy with it.
2,Gave up on it,I had very little success getting the wrinkles out of blouses. It's a lot of trouble to use it. I might as well iron. I'm careful to buy easy care fabrics only..
5,"A guide for the Bereaved Survivor by Robert Baugher, Ph.D. and Marc Calija","My husband died of ALS, and I took care of him until his passing. This book helped me through the very difficult time I went through after my husband passed away. When you lose someone who has been the main center of your life, it leaves a huge hole. You wonder how you will ever get through the rest of your life without that person. At least that is the way it was for me at the beginning. This book was a true blessing, letting me know those feelings were normal, but that I would get through that period, and life goes on. There are pages of suggestions as to how you can overcome the grief. I highly recommend this book. Thank you Dr. Baugher for publishing this book."
5,Great Book for Air Force Buffs,"This is a great book for Air Force Buffs. It may not be an exhaustive history but is still a great book. The lavish pictures are great to explore. If you have an interest in ""the wild blue yonder"" that is based on fact and not fiction, this may be a great choice for you. The book is awesome in appearance also."
1,Air Force History? Don't think so,"I saw this book & quite frankly I agree with one of the major editorial groups that evaluated this publication. I am disappointed by this book's authors who fail to mention a background on all who affected the Air Force then & now. No background was ever given to the career histories of the chiefs of staff & civilian secretaries especially Hap Arnold. To some, these histories are boring, but to others they provide a thorough background for how the Air Force organizes, fights, & wins any type of war that may surface. Lousy book & definitely too bulky with no pertinent information."
1,This CD is TERRIBLE!,"I hate to say it but this CD is trash. Happily Ever After is the only good song on the CD! The songs were so sloppliy done. When I first listened to the CD, I got a bad impression but I thought it would grow on me. I thought wrong. After my second and third listen I buried the CD. I haven't touched it since the day that I bought it. Case could have come out with something better than this. Don't waste your money like I did. Dub someone else's CD!!!!!!!"
1,THIS IS PURE,"This cd is PURE GARBAGE, i mean the real stuff. I wouldn't even use the cd cover to wipe my..........well you know. I admit, he has a nice voice at times, but maybe it was the songs, melodies, or what, but he's not a true artist. I was very disappointed at how i wasted my money on this album, now i can't even give it away for free."
3,Muted Conversation,"Following his debut which had his hit ""Touch Me"" featuring Foxy Brown, Case released his sophomore album entitled ""Personal Conversation."" Its main attractions are the straight-from-the-heart ballad ""Happily Ever After,"" which, I'm sure, has been getting much play at weddings, as well as ""Faded Pictures,"" a mid-tempo duet with Joe. Both songs were hits and make the best use of Case's limitations as a singer. But elsewhere, we're treated to same-old r&b grooves that try their hardest to mask Case's barely-there voice. Fortunately, he went on to record the vastly superior ""Open Letter,"" showing that there can be life after the sophomore slump."
5,I think as a up coming performer he shows veratility .,"I so much like his 2nd. single Happiely ever after. Its aalsome wedding song who did he work with,How long have he been working at it? I just heard two songs off the album I can hear that a lot of care went into this producion.Do you need any more artist on your labil? and if so how can I be down ? Cause Im a singer song writer if I could colaborate with some writters your writters I would gladly apresheate the afford. So were can I send my songs to? if possable."
2,another sad attempt,"it may seem like a grade cdz hard, but i only grade them based on the contents of the album, personally i think that case is a great artist. his songs are different from other artists, but not different from his own. EVERY song on this record sounds EXACTLY the same. besides the fact that faded pictures wasn't that great of a song, but it appears on the album TWICE, and happily ever after was something special, until he tried to push it as his only single makin' it become an overplayed bunch of dribble. people must be insane if they don't know every single word the that song. the track with cam'ron is awesome, but case really needs to do something with himself, possibly another team up with foxy brown, since she made touch me tease me what it is. i'm very disapointed."
4,Pleasantly surprised!!,I bought the CD for two songs - Happily Ever After and Faded Pictures. I was surprised when I heard the rest of the CD. It was very nice. Keep up with the good work!
4,Case in point,"Case's first self-titled album was okay but Personal Conversations is head and shoulders over that album. Happily Ever After, Faded Pictures featuring Joe and Think Of You are pretty good choices for singles. The best songs on the album are usually the slow songs like Caught You, Think Of You, Happily Ever After and Another Minute. He Dont Love You has Case singing over a pounding R&B beat but the song actually works. The Soul Central Version of Faded Pictures is alright but its not better than the original. Tell Me is dull as dishwater. Where Did Our Love Go goes nowhere and Scandalous featuring Cam'ron is straight garbage. Outside of these flaws the album is a worthwhile purchase that proved that Case was not another flash in the pan artist and could have been a force to be reckoned with if he was given the chance. Standouts: HAPPILY EVER AFTER, THINK OF YOU, FADED PICTURES, CAUGHT YOU, HE DONT LOVE YOU and IF."
3,Happily Ever is a Great Song,"I really like Case and this song is sure to be a classic. I have listened to it over and over again on this CD. However, I have to be honest and say that it is the only song that really made the CD. The rest of the CD is mediocre and repetitious. I would recommend buying Happily Ever After as a single only."
4,Night after Night Jams,"Case, has definately made it. This album really explains love, and it's features. I would recommend it to all. Don't hesitate, go to the music stores, and check this one out!!Couple Jams for sure!!"
5,THIS SONG IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!,I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH!!!!!!! ME AND MY BOYFRIEND MADE THIS OUR SONG!!!! IT'S SO SWEET!!! I THINK CASE HAS THE MOST WONDERFUL VOICE I'VE EVER HEARD...... I LOVE THIS SONG LUV ME MS. KANDI 99''
3,Hellstrom Chronical,"It is an old film I have been trying to get for years. Quality of CD mediocre. Price high but it is a real specialty item, very difficult to find."
3,Uhhh... not TOO bad,"Well, the beginning isn't that good. Maybe just cause it's me, but here's a summary so you can see for yourself.So three girls, Jen, Chelsea, and Amy are going to Jen's grandparents' house for the summer. THere, they're gonna work and hang out. However, right when they first get there, Chelsea misses her boyfriend Noah, and her and Jen get into an argument about who gets the best bedroom. Anyways, later in the book, Noahs suddenly comes to stay with the girls in the house, and he nevers pays for anything! But Jen has a crush on a guy at where she works, called Dylan. He's just looking for a summer fling though, cause he's going to the army in the fall. So.... Jen learns to cope with lots of things, and learns that things sometimes will not follow her planning and just happen unexpectedly.So yeah. Not a bad book, but not as good as Caribbean Cruising in my opinion!"
3,Alright... I've Read Better,This book isn't boring but I've definatley read better books. I think this is my least favorite book by Rachel. All of her others are very enjoyable and fun reads. I very much recommend you read this as a last resort.
4,a Rosenblum fan,"Robert Rosenblum is a true scholar in the world of art history. Throughout my undergraduate years, I had looked to his writings for guidance and to gain an understanding of the subject matter. While 1900, Art At The Crossroads is enjoyable and the color plates are stunning, it should be noted that it is companion piece to an exhibition and not a book for academic research. Overall, it is a fine book."
1,green goblets,"I was so happy to find these goblets on-line, since they never seem to have any stock at Macy's, even when they are advertised on sale. You can imagine when I got mine, open the box, and lo and behold, they are not the same color green as the ones I purchased at Macy's. I will be having to return all that I bought. It was the first time I ever ordered anything, and now I am leary about ordering anything else."
5,Faraway Land - The Rest of the Gospel in song,I am very grateful for the printed lyrics that come with the album. Each song has a message for the seeker that is beyond the typical Christian music theme. The music is memorable and well performed. I look forward to more albums from this composer. I appreciate the daily reminder of Christ's message and power that comes with memorizing the lyrics.
4,An understated musician makes a valiant first effort...,"Union Station has had some ups and downs, but each member has proven their abilities are beyond the average pickers and grinners. Alison is the velvet voice and violin prodigy, Dan is the Soggy Bottom Boy, Jerry is the Dobro Wizard, Barry is the good-looking bass player, and Ron is that guy on the end that plays the banjo.What Ron actually is, is a guitar and banjo virtuoso. He doesn't have a superstar's voice, or a superstar's looks. What he does have is a strong faith in Christ, and a gift for writing bluegrass gospel music. He takes that faith to a new level in this, his first release. I enjoyed it, and I look forward to more of his work."
5,as promised,the item arrived in a very timely manner in the condition advertised I would use this vendor again
4,Nice job,Book in excellent condition and great price. We were very happy with the quality when this book arrived Just what my son needed for class.
2,"too pricy, and not very easy to use","This book is good for one reason, it contains brief history of world art and many illustration and photos of its work. It is also in correct order as art evolute. However, I wish it just came in one form of book rather two spread books in one cheap case. It was not necessary, I do not want to loose one book, over the other. Its hard to read when there are two books split."
2,Poor,"Although the text itself is in good condition, the cover of the book is torn and the binding is torn down the spine. There are also comments written on the pages surrounding many of the pictures. None of this information was disclosed in the description."
4,Art History,"to be purchased with Hartt's volumes on Art History. it creates a very useful coupling and very agile in quick consultation, something to get the initial appetite to then satisfy with more specialized readings.it does provide - though - quintessential tools on architecture nomenclature - necessary to study"
5,One thick book.,"This book is chocked full of good art history information from the cave paintings in Lascaux to pieces from the early 2000's (nothing from the early 2000's that I'm familiar with, but there is a bit included). There are plenty of good pictures included in the book, and the CD-ROM seems like it would be really helpful for studying slides for art history tests, although i haven't done that yet. This book is pricey, yet its a good reference book for all those into art and art history. (plus its fun to look at even for those who aren't really into art (a good coffee table book after you've forgotten how much it cost??)) Well written material so I would recommend buying it if you are serious about art history."
1,Koolatron coffee maker takes over an hour to make coffee.,"I would not recommmend the Koolatron 12 volt coffee maker. I have a 2 battery system and shore power hookup and the Koolatron coffee make took 69 minutes to make one pot of coffee. I hope i can get an RMA for this coffee maker and return it. Making a pot in ""minutes"" (as advertised) should never include an hour and 9 minutes."
2,defective product... wierd return policy,"Product was defective out of the box. Called to see if I could get an exchange. Nope, they don't do that. They refunded my shipping charges and I was emailed a return shipping label. I guess it is returned directly to the manufacturer. May have to wait several weeks for the refund. I can understand the defective produce. The return policy is frustrating. I ordered another from someone else."
1,Customer Service?,"Ordered this hat according to the hat sizing chart and received a hat obviously too small. I followed the return policy instructions and tried to contact the seller (three times) and after a month they have yet to respond. Unless my head starts shrinking rapidly, this fella is going to Goodwill."
4,everynite pure rock pleasure,"Leaving the remnents of Braid to the indie rock store clerks, Hey Mercedes takes the former band and makes a strong full length debut. The craftmanship shown on all the songs is beyond most ""emo"" bands(i dont care much for that term anyway). They play good, hard rock music, with a subtle melody buried beneath each chorus. Only on repeatd listens is the audience allowed to find the groove of this cd. The lyrics dont expand on anything beyond girl troubles but, are fashioned in a very unique way. In fact, the song ""Our Weekend Starts on Wednesday"", should be the anthem for any young person trying to begin a relationship. It's almost the perfect song about being in love, set to a killer backdrop of dueling guitars and awesome lyrics. All together, not a bad record, but a very good first record by a band that has a very promising future that I can't wait to be a part of."
3,"Something is missing for that extra ""oomph""","I'm a big fan of melodic punk, emo, and pretty much anything else that rocks. And this was one cd that I had waited forever to get my hands on. So was it worth the wait? Actually it was partially a let down. Maybe my expectations were very high, but I don't throughly love this album. But don't get me wrong. It's still a rocking good time thats better than much of the stuff out there. The music is great, albeit a little repetative. The biggest problem lies with the lyrics which seem muddled in areas. I've had this album for a while now, but I just recently rediscovered it and I want to give it another chance. Who knows, maybe it'll grow on me. I really wish I could give a 3.5..."
1,Disappointing,"I love Hey Mercedes. Farm brings that fire on nearly every track. But this collection fell a little flat with this former Braid fanatic. The syncopated drumming and angular guitar work are still there, but it's just not the same. E for effort-but 1 star for quality."
1,"so I'm told that chicagos cold, can't be cool as California",braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together. braid needs to get back together.
4,A great progression from the Braid days,"With Hey Mercedes, I came in expecting nothing more than a rehash of the Braid days and was pleasantly surprised to see them develop their sound. Are they changing the world of music as we know it with this sound? No. But is that really what's important? They are creating great songs that make you want to pop this CD back in time and time again. They've kept the best parts of Braid and expanded. More so than having an elaborate concept album or a huge stadium tour or whatever, that is the sign of a great band. I can't wait to hear where Hey Mercedes goes next."
4,small pill,"Very small pill, good smooth coating - easy to swallow.The bottle also is very small. Easy to open (for those of us with hand problems)"
1,The Cooking of Germany/Time-Life Series,These books are fabulous resources but this one inparticular was in terrible shape...the binding wascompletely loose...
5,I love it,Have all this stuff on vinyl from way back then - sounds so much better with advances in sound quality.
4,Live at Colgate University,"This is a great live album, but it was better at the show itself. I was there at Colgate University, in the front row, when they recorded this. I wish they would have given Colgate credit for the work we did hosting them to produce this excellent live album."
3,Great for Entertaining Types,"If you need ideas on how to create outdoor spaces for entertaining - this book is for you. Dining, lounging, dining, lounging... Even different photos of the same patio have different place settings on the tables to give you dining ideas. After a while, I began looking for spaces where you could do something other than dine, or lounge. Overall, nice photos of nice outdoor spaces, but limited appeal."
4,Outdoor Rooms are awesome!,"While I don't have oodles of cash to slather all about my little acre I do dream big & beautiful & that's why Julie Taylor's book called to me. I live so much of my life outside, even in the foggy mists on the hem of a rainforest that I have had several ideas about outdoor rooms. This book explores bringing the outdoors in & the indoors out. It is a collection of spaces designed by a host of Design Professionals & captured by another host of Photographers. It is a great winter read when images of sunshine & verdancy fill our minds & we look about our nest & wonder how to expand it, how to live out of doors & still be safe from the elements. Lovely, sumptuous feast for your eyes. For my full review do check out: [my website]."
1,Big Disappointment,"I bought this book for ideas on design, but it turned out to be a big disappointment. Unless you have beaucoup of cash, this book is just a tease."
4,The River Has Never Divided Us,Interesting history of the Rio Grande / Big Bend area. Political comentary intrudes (to the book's detriment) at times.
4,Learn how real Texans feel about the Border,"The title, The River Has Never Divided Us, says it all. Texicans and Mexicans have been ""fussing and fighting, loving and dying"" with each other for 200 years. The Border did not divide us until 9/11. Mergenthaler focuses on the community around the junction of the Rio Concho and the Rio Grande to illustrate the relationship and essential unity of the people on both sides of what is, afterall, an arbitrary political border."
4,Excellent summary of Southwest Texas history,I haven't found many books concerning the history of this part of Texas. It was easy to read and based off of documented research. I'd recommend it to anybody researching this topic.
4,Love it,"This is an excellent CD. While Doc's voice is showing some signs of age, it also provides an interesting perspective on how long (+40 yrs) he has been doing it. So few musician show any sign of soul... I hope Doc never quit's recording."
4,A flawed but valuable book,"This is a valuable book and essential reading for anyone interested in the subject. Newton has very obvious biases - his mean-spirited portrayal of Philby, for example - but he conducted many interviews with the remaining principals, did much research in the US files, came up with some interesting material on the crucial role of Maclean, and takes a thought-provoking look at the murky circumstances of Burgess and Maclean's defection. Newton is inclined to hyperbole and drama and goes off on some odd tangents, but his views are a useful corrective to the hyper-romantic view of the recent BBC television series, ""Cambridge Spies."" Worth checking out."
3,Not nearly enough space for an expressive mommy,"The pictures were cute, but overpowered the layout of each page. I have twins, myself, and didn't think it was necessarily conducive to twins as mentioned in another review. I ended up getting a book that allowed more room for personal photographs and far more pages to keep track of my babies' first years."
2,Somehat disappointed,While the pictures are wonderful. I found that there is limited writing space available and also limited space to put photos of your own child.
2,Baby Album-Just OK,"This item was just ok. This is a hardcover book and the book arrived with one book corner dented in.Also, the pictures appear to be very dated and the book must have been printed long ago.It was a good price for the value of the book."
5,Unbelievaby Cute Pictures,This is one of the cutest baby books I've ever seen. Anne Geddes does a wonderful job with these babies. The pictures are unquestionably the best.
2,Review of 2001 edition- my first five years,"I wrote a previous review praising this book. However, once I actually tried to USE it I changed my mind! There is no room for pictures of MY baby, because the book is too full of the Anne Geddes photos. Which are very cute, yes. But I want to see pictures of my son. I have moved on to a scrapbook type baby book and it is WAY better!"
1,ANNE GEDDES EXPLOITS!,Has anyone ever given a thought to the young children who are grossly exploited in ALL of ANNE GEDDES work. This woman has made her money off exploiting babies who have had their basic human rights taken away from them. This is a significant breech of human rights.
5,Excellent Product,"I purchased this product with the following product:3 Way Adjustable Tilting Desk Mount Bracket for LCD (Max 33Lbs, 10~25inch) - BlackI like Omnimount BETTER because it is a ROCK solid device. The 3Way Adjust Mount can't seem to be level NO matter how much adjustment I tried. More important, the 3Way Adjust Mount is just too long and cause too much torque onto the base mount that clamps onto the desk.The only disadvantage with Omnimount has is that it doesn't extend out beyond the base. But it is a solid device and does EXACTLY as advertise. Did I say the Omnimount is a lot cheaper than the3 Way Adjustable Tilting Desk Mount Bracket for LCD (Max 33Lbs, 10~25inch) - Black"
1,It's dishonest to sell this book.,"I used this book for a senior/graduate prestressed concrete class. The chapter headings looked appropriate. But the book is loaded with errors. As near as I can tell, no example in the book is correct. Early on I contacted the author about a few errors and got no meaningful response. Finally, I sent a partial list of errors and the names of my unfortunate students who bought the book to the publisher. They allowed my students to exchange the book.Recovering from selecting this book and switching to other resources cost me many hours. Although, going through the books by Collins and Menn was very useful.In my opinion, your best bet for a class is to contact PCI or start with M.P. Collins (out of print, but I found a used copy), the PCI handbook, and fundamental papers."
1,No Good,"There are several reasons not to use this book. The most important reason is that several of the example problems are solved incorrectly. These are commonly numerical mistakes, but in some cases, they are logically incorrect. This makes it extremely difficult to follow the complex theory involved in prestressed concrete. I suggest using another prestressed concrete text."
1,Worst textbook I have ever used!,"The biggest problem is that there are so many typographical errors, that it is hard to trust the formulas presented. Flowcharted procedures are great. In most examples, you can't figure out how the author got to the solution. I had a grad class with 9 other professionals. We spent most of our time beating up the examples and the solutions in the solutions manual. Once we reached Ch. 4, it was a struggle to get what the author was saying. We only made it to Ch. 7. With a good text, we could have covered 50% more material. Students, call PCI to get free Design Manuals (not a textbook replacement) for the whole class."
1,Lack of steps for clarity,"I chose the book to learn prestressed concrete as I saw the word ""Fundamental Approach..."" on its cover. However, the book lacks basic steps and explanations in deriving formula and solving example problems. Some crucial information is not given in the end-of-chapter problems. It is also the first engineering book i have read in which -735psi < -2250psi...Very confusing."
2,Very Badly Written,"Like all of Professor Nawy's books, this one is extremely badly written. There are numerous typos and mistakes, although some are kind of entertaining. The Reinforced Concrete Book for example discusses the ""modulus of rapture"" of concrete. The chapter on Unbonded Post-tensioning in the Concrete Construction book discusses ""prostrating tendons"".This is probably not a bad book for an experienced engineer, and might even be considered a useful exercise, since nothing in the book should be relied on without checking at least one other reference. It is not a book that should be used to learn prestressed concrete design however."
4,Good Product,"The Recorder/player is a good product. It is small, portable and easy to use. The only downside is NO Digital Tuner."
4,The best brand of wood betony I have found,"I have tried other brands of wood betony, but Nature's Sunshine works best for headaches and it relaxes the whole body"
2,what did they do to it?,"I've had Wood Betony from several different companies in the past, and know what results should be. The product you had sent to me seems to be a placebo, and I would not again order this product from them. Actually, I thought you yourself might have a supply on hand, which is why I ordered from you.It's interesting that I have received a good shipment from Natures Sunshine in the past (different lot #), but they have changed something with their Wood Betony product, evidently."
1,Attack of the talentless,"Do not consider this book as a reasonable critique. This is a mess of spite from two people who fit the phrase ""Those who cannot, will criticize."""
1,Worst Rock & Roll Book of All Time - Arrogance Unbridled,"The arrogance of these non-accomplished authors knows no bounds. To selfishly ridicule some of those most prolific musicians such as Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, Billy Joel and others in an effort to have their definition dictate what rock and roll is simply isn't credible. Who are these two idiots to have any aura of authenticity with their list? Write a song like ""Ticket to Ride"", ""Highway Blues"", ""All for Leyna"" etc. and then tell me you know what is what. Dont give your money to these jokers."
5,I found myself saying yes,"I was born in 1938 only a couple of years before Bobbie Ann, in the northwest corner of our country but my experience growing up was so like hers. I found myself saying yes and even remembering pictures of my family that are so similar. This was a wonderful memoir that I could really connect to. Nancy Drew and Little Women (although the movie sadly disappointed me) and popular music before rock and roll were all a part of my life. Life in the country seems to be the same all over our United States. I've loved Mason's novels and I can see why now with her life so displayed for us."
4,"lovely memoir, I'm a KY expat as well","My family's roots are in the Mayfield, KY area, so this was a beautiful memoir of a woman born and raised in KY who moves elsewhere only to return. I loved it, I too am a Kentuckian who has moved on to other places, perhaps to return later in life. Her characters were incredibly real to me; I think anyone with a rural past who is trying to make sense of who they are and where they fit into the wider world would love and identify with this lovely work."
1,product caught fire,"i had this plugged into my computer and backup harddrive for a total of 15 minutes before i began to hear the power supply sizzling/plastic bubbling. just as i am frantically uplugging the drive, and throwing the power strip off, smoke begins to billow from the hub ports. it could have been worse had i not stuck around... i cannot recomend this product for safety concerns."
2,Wait for O'Reilly's Book Instead,"Better than some. Good basic intro to PHP, for the most part. Sections on mySQL are muddled. The bits on table joins, a fairly important topic, are explained poorly + all too briefly. I had to turn to online tutorials to clear things up. Going back to the book, the author's descriptions on table joins still didn't make any sense. Thank god he wasn't my only source.Entire chapter waster detailing app that's on the CD --- an app which is pretty much useless to you if you're not running your own server.The index at the back of the book is fairly useless as well.All + all, I wouldn't recommend this -- unless you're desperate for a PHP/mySQL book + are sick of waiting for O'Reilly + Associates to publish theirs (which is pretty much the reason why I bought this thing)."
3,Good Primer,"I've looked at a bunch of PHP books and this one is a good variable/basic primer. I was a bit daunted by the length of the Wrox book so I picked this one up to quickly learn the basics. I wasn't too disappointed.However, there are several code typos (luckily, they can be found corrected on the author's web site). In addition, I found some of the comments about certain things vague. He talks about forms and cookies but fails to give a simple example to reinforce these subjects. His discussion on PHP objects left me with many questions. I also didn't like having PHP functions used without explaining them to me first (I had to hit php's web site to learn what they did). I suppose I could've used the function glossary in the back of the book, but that is pretty spartan (and consumes about 100 pages).Overall, I recommend this book to seasoned programmers (a first-time programmer would be crushed) who want to know the basics of PHP quickly. Pick up the Wrox book as well for the details."
1,Irrelevant,This is a PHP3 book and the current version is PHP4 -- so it behooves you to look for a good PHP4 book. I threw my copy away.
1,bad as hell,"hi!this book is the worst one i ever worked with. the author uses advanced implementations in the first few examples, without explaination; some statements are just simply wrong (type error?) and the peak are wrong working examples. e.g. page 84/85 a flag variable is used to track a break in a loop; but the flag is defined after the break - it never gets executed and in the end the script does the whole opposite!rating this book 4 or 5 stars means didn't read it!cheers,Dirk"
2,Rough start,"Unfortunately, I expected the accompanying CD containing mysql, apache, php, etc., to be useful. Instead, the .tar files wouldn't compile without errors (I tried them on 2 different machines), and the my_ODBC tarball is actually for Windows. I ended up downloading the .tar's which then compiled flawlessly.Now that I've gotten past the installation (no thanks to the book), I'm finding typos in the sample code. Grrrrrr."
2,Good MySQL and PHP3 variable types primer but ...,"I better understood how to use mySQL after reading this book since it focused on mySQL and XML (which I haven't bothered to read yet) separately from using PHP3 to program database applications. Good section on an existing application ""phpMyAdmin"". Found a good discussion on php datatypes, which as a programmer I seldom read. There's a chapter on regular expressions which is useful. But MOST of PHP3 isn't discussed at all. I was disappointed. Even the reference at the back gives only function names, not even the parameters.Buy this book only if you must have a php3 book and also want to learn about mySQL."
3,"Good how-to's, lacking power","I feel this book is well written, however lacking some content. For those needing database connectivity, the examples in this book are beautiful, well defined, and easy to understand. I have personally used the content of the book to help me build 3 live production databases. I have needs for other areas of PHP now, and what I need is not covered in this book. I'll need to get another book for other areas of PHP, but I won't complain. This book has helped me tremendously on the job."
1,A terrible book,"I was developing two websites using PHP3 and MySQL so I bought this book to help: wrong. It's a disaster. It's been three months since I bought the book and I've gotten zero information from it. Today I tried to find out how to get the date, the index doesn't have date or time listed. It doesn't help with putting data in, or getting data out of forms or databases. Save your money."
2,"Great for beginners, a wasted money for professionals","While this book is great for beginners to make a kick-start, almost everything covered in this book is available on the Internet, either on newsgroups/mailing lists, or php-related websites.Nothing original, no tips & tricks, just plain reference/tutorial.If you are just starting writing in PHP, this book is a very good reference.If you are programming on PHP more than a year, you don't need this book anymore, as you know Altavista and php mailing list."
2,Not Olga's best,"I think of Olga Tanon as the queen of Merengue, with great authentic rythms. This collection leans much more towards the blandish pop side. It's not bad, exactly, just a little dull."
3,Ok but there is better,Fun if you link up with a friend but it gets old quick. Only buy if you don't get board easily
2,This game ain't too great,I have played this game and it is realy hard and plus there arent any codes to help you get through the game. Unless you want a big challenge don't buy this game.
1,Should Have Stayed In The Vault!!!!,"Sorry, Buckley fans; this recording only tarnishes Tim's legacy. The whole ""funk"" period is one of the worst career moves ever made by an artist of Tim's stature. What was he thinking? Or better yet, what were his managers/handlers/friends thinking? The band is godawful and the songs are bad. Maybe it was a case of people more interested in their paycheck than in having Tim's best interests at heart. Or was it that Tim wouldn't listen to anyone? The music business is littered with talented people who were their own worst enemy, and I think Tim probably falls into that category. His mid-period stuff (Blue Afternoon, Lorca and Starsailor) is truly some of the most original and stirring music ever produced; but save your $$$ and avoid this disc or any of the 3 funk discs (Greetings from L.A., Sefronia, and Look At The Fool)........"
4,Monty and Iris,I really like this series however all the books need major grammar and spelling editing. It is so irritating when it would be so simple to do. As for the story Monty deserved someone a little less insecure. Iris' character is a little contradictory. She is strong one moment and whiney the next. Overall a good read.
4,Classic!!,"All of the stories contained herein are from Tom Bodett, slice-of-life vignettes about his fictional town of End-of-the-Road, Alaska. It's just an average small town, like the small town a lot of us think we remember. Quirky characters, funny stories, and all. Of the three collections in this one uber-collection, my favorite is ""Those Grand Occasions at the End of the Road"". Makes me want to go to the Christmas tree lighting at The Park or try to trap-shoot Easter eggs."
1,WHAT?,In my opinion the author is completely off base with his theories. I don't see how this book can help anyone of any age. I'm glad this was a borrowed book. My time could have been better spent on a cheap romance novel.
5,Military Preparedness in the Battle of Aging,"This book maps out the terrain that 76 million people are now entering. The social implications are dealt with at length. The thought of living in poverty in one's 'Golden Years' should sound an alarm for boomers who are addicted to consumption and worse yet the 'Plastic Enabler'. I have purchased copies for my siblings whose devil may care attitudes of today presage a painful tommorrow. Definitive studies on the physical effects of aging are being done by companies like Geron Corp.whose ""telomerase"" technology could reveal a basis for aging and the slowing or reversal of its effects."
1,Had to put it down.,I just had to put this one down! This was one useless book in my opinion. I purchase it for its alleged value to the business person. I just didn't get how the content was applicable to selling to the aging or where the author came up with some of his ideas. I would be inclined to agree with the readers from California. This was one dry and pointless piece of fiction.
5,I really enjoyed this book!,Bought this at the airport bookstore and read it on the plane - couldn't put it down. I recommend Age Power to anyone who doesn't stick their head in the sand - especially those worried about the future (or non-future!) of their Social Security benefits. Very eye-opening!
2,King's Crusader,"Into the bloody turbulence of the Third Crusade he rode, head-on, his lute slung over his shoulder, his dagger firm at his side, a loyal and courageous man dedicated to finding his missing friend and master. Richard the Lion Hearted. The man was Bondel, minstrel and warrior, with a nose for adventure, and eye for his own advantage, and an ever-present passion for a high-born woman.Sorry, Not my type of book"
3,"The ""grass"" ain't quite so ""blue""","Alison Krauss' latest effort definitely takes a detour away from bluegrass into a more pop sensibility, and the change is not for the better. I can understand Ms. Krauss wanting to widen her fan base, but I don't think this was the way to do it. The new recording can't really be completely satisfying to those of us who have been fans all along nor those who are close to becoming fans. The bluegrass is diluted and the pop isn't pop enough. Ms. Krauss would be better served, as would her fan base (established or burgeoning) by sticking closer to the heart of what makes her unique, a modern dedication to bluegrass traditions."
4,More great music from AKUS,"While Alison Krauss and Union Station (AKUS) have not had a whole lot of support from country radio in the past, they continue to be a force to reckon with in bluegrass music.This CD is my favorite - no pun intended - by AKUS, it's very cool the way Krauss shares lead vocal duties with Dan Tyminski (George Clooney's voice in O Brother). I love his voice on ""The Boy Who Wouldn't Hoe Corn"". The best song on the CD, in my opinion, is ""Let Me Touch You for a While"" - Krauss' voice just soars! ""The Lucky One"" is a fairly upbeat song and ""Choctaw Hayride"" is a rollicking instrumental with Earl Scruggs on banjo. Tyminski pops back up on lead vocals for ""Momma Cried"", another haunting song. The Gillian Welch penned title track closes out the CD with a bang.The highest profile band in bluegrass is still going strong and show no signs of slowing down - Krauss is not even 30 yet. Keep it coming AKUS!"
4,NO Lyrics!!??,"I enjoy this CD and I cannot add to what has already been said, however, I am disappointed that the lyrics were not included in the sleeve. One reason to purchase CD's instead of burning them is to support the artist and HAVE the lyrics to the songs on the CD. Alison and Union Station is not the only set of artists to have this short coming. I recently purchased nine new CD's from Amazon, (nearly all were this year's grammy winners) and not a single sleeve included lyrics. I feel short-changed!"
4,Pretty good,This is the best recording I've found so far after O'Brother.I listen to it frequently. I especially like Dan T.'s tracks.
2,Couple Good Tracks,"Some are snoozers. You know Dylan had Blood on the Tracks, the Doobie Bros had Stampede, but then they had a difficult time repeating the magic. Alison Krauss and Union Station had EveryTime You Say Goodbye and So Long, So Wrong, both immensely powerful albums. This latest album has me kind of scared - like the record companies told her to stick to ho-hum ballads and let the rest of the band play the good stuff (which they do good on this album)."
4,again & again,Alison Krauss & Union Station what is there to say. Another great CD by the best in bluegrass. listen to it several times and you find yourself playing it over & over. Not exactly what you expect from bluegrass but as always they go beyond the bounds. It is now one of my favorite cd.
3,"Don't ""Forget About It"", but...","An earlier reviewer noted that ""good"" is about as bad as an AKUS album is likely to be, and I concur. Compared to what else is out there -- and certainly compared to pop/country radio -- this is a terrific album. But while the band sounds good, song selection is weaker than might be expected. The opening track is tuneful but shallow, lyrically. The second track opens with portentous chords, a big Springsteen-ian (if that's a word) buildup. Are there issues of war and peace to be discussed? No, the problem is ""the boy who wouldn't hoe corn""... There are a number of fine songs here -- the title track in particular (a Gillian Welch tune) stood out for me. Overall, though, a minor disappointment. Good, but not great."
5,"another brilliant ""newgrass"" collection from AKUS","For those of us who love the music of Alison Krauss and Union Station, New Favorite will be a great addition to our collections. This album continues to expand the bounderies of ""newgrass"" without departing from the traditional roots. I would highly recommend this album."
3,New Favorite,"This CD has grown on me a little bit more each time I listen to it. Alison Krauss' voice is so unique and clear; her voice is the best part of this recording.Since I'm not a biggest fan of this genre of music, don't be too dissuaded by my opinion."
5,The Pure Sound of Happiness,"No matter if you are a brand-new or seasoned fan of bluegrass, you must add this bluegrass album to your collection. As said in previous reviews, the musicianship is stellar--no one person stands out above the rest because the group members are all so talented together.The violins and mandolins soar. Alison Krauss's voice is from another world--you will never experience another voice as sweet and pure. It's spun sugar.The songs ""The Lucky One"" and ""New Favorite"" stand out in their contemplative, melancholy sweetness. The emotions of these songs are so much more complicated than the usual pop we're inundated with today. The song ""Stars"" is a hopeful and lovely Dan Fogelberg cover and one of my favorites on the album."
4,AKUS hits their stride,"This has to be the best recording that AKUS has done to date. Lyrics, music, bluegrass, country, rock.... it doesn't matter.. this is a CD from the heart...This is the type of music that touches one's heart and soul, and makes one's self better for the touch."
5,An Amazing CD,"This is my first review ever, and I had to write it for this CD! It is an amazing work. I'm somewhat new to bluegrass and Alison Krauss, but it hasn't been out of my CD palyer since I bought it a few weeks ago. I was lucky enough to see these folks in concert last night, and man what a show! Her voice has such a wonderful range, and they all are such talented musicians. Their music sounds even better live, which is unusual these days in my experience."
4,"My ""New Favorite""","I love so many songs on this CD. My sister had borrowed me her copy years ago. Now I have my own. I wish they had cut the 'New Favorite' track off at the end of the song, then did a seperate track for the goof up. I massage and some of my clients like mellow songs with words this would have made a great addition to a cd."
4,A Bootleg? - Farm Scene Cover,"I bought a used CD with this title, but the cover is a farm scene, and there is no copyright/publication information, just track titles. Also Alison's first name is spelled with two ""l""s. The CD itself has the word ""Wingbow""."
5,VERY good.,Good! best she has done! Great combination of vocals and instrumental! Her voice is stronger! Tons more variety and it is SUPER to hear the guys! Bravo!
5,all around music fan,"I recently picked up this cd and the new live from Louisville as well. I have her first album and I liked it very much but, these two new cds are in a class by themselves. Alison's voice is haunting in her song ""New Favorite"". I listened to this song 7 times in a row before I decided to move on....it really takes your breath away. She puts such feeling into her music and this song indicates this better than any of her earlier songs in my opinion. Other songs on the cd compliment the title song very well...there are really no less than par songs on the entire album...they are all excellent. Her band shines in this cd. The instrumentation is incredible.I recently purchased a new stereo and wanted some new music to put it through it's paces. This cd did the job with bells on!Every breath Alison takes and every string that is picked wastingling. I highly recomend this cd especially if you are new to Ms. Krauss and Union Station. Buy it! It's money well spent....trust me!"
5,No expectations,"It seems that most of the negative or lukewarm reviews here are written by those who approached this record with expectations of what bluegrass should be, or what Krauss & Union Station should be, or what country should be.I came in with none of those. I know almost nothing about bluegrass or AKUS...I'm not even sure what a dobro is.I heard ""Lucky One"" on an ""adult alternative"" radio station, of all places, and had heard about Krauss' talent, so I took a chance on this CD. I'm not a country fan nor a bluegrass fan by any means, I just thought it was a pretty song.It turns out that the whole CD is very strong, filled with beautifully written and performed songs. There's definitely a pop feel to a few of the tunes, such as Fogelberg's ""Stars"", but every one is played and sung with feeling and musicianship. The production values are excellent too -- no studio gimmicks, just pure sounds crystal clear.It's hard to imagine anyone who appreciates music being let down by this set."
4,Aptly Titled,"Alison Krauss and Union Station continue to amaze with their ability to dig into American music both old and new. They combine the best of bluegrass, country, and folk and make it all sound organic. Two of the best songs in this set are by Robert Lee Castleman, a writer whose name should be a household word but isn't, alas. Castleman's songs are little stories; he is something of the Raymond Carver of country music (not to be confused with Robert Carver of audiophile fame). With expressive singing and energetic playing, the band provides solid musicianship from start to finish, and the recording quality is excellent. For old fans and new fans alike, this CD is aptly named."
5,"Awesome, as they usually are!!",Of course it's a great CD. If you don't know them then you should and start your collection today.
2,this album is by far not her best,"about the only good song on hear is ""the lucky one"" , not worth the money , some of her older work is the best!!!"
2,Watered down cliche' country music,"I don't know what to make of this CD. I'm a longtime bluegrass fan, and I've certainly heard of Ms. Krauss's reputation, so I thought I'd give it a try. Well...I just don't know. It's as if solid bluegrass musicians were hamstrung and forced to play lightweight, bland country music. There's just not much here to reccommend. For ever moment where there's starting to be some real melody and musicianship, there are twice as many long stretches of non-descript country music. The male vocalist in particular is about as generic country--not bluegrass my any means--as they come. Walk down music row in Nashville and you can find half a dozen men who could fill his shoes quite well. Overall this is a forgettable CD, and I'm not willing to take a chance on this band again."
2,Disappointing CD From an Outstanding Lady,"I love Alison Krauss CDs. This one disappointed me greatly. There are 3 or 4 typical Alison style songs on this CD, but the others are very strange and different from other things she has done. Please don't waste your money as I did."
2,i didn't like this cd,I loved that song the Lucky One and I think Alison Krauss has the voice of an angel but this cd isn't good it only has one good sony that is the Lucky One
2,This doesn't compare,with earlier Alison Krauss/Union Station material. It's not good Bluegrass; it's not good Country; it's not good anything. EVERY TIME YOU SAY GOODBYE is the AKUS CD to buy (5 stars without a doubt).
5,AK & US at their best,"Alison Krauss & Union Station cross over all lines of music. They have a sound that appeals to all, no matter what kind of music is your favorite. Their ability to blend, not only their voices, but their instruments is sheer genius. Surperb job!!!!"
2,Got a scanned copy of an original.,"Bought this and received text printed from the on-demand service Lulu. Their printing service is excellent, but this book was a crappy scan from an original. Be aware that you may not be getting the real deal.Those issues aside, the book is very fun and covers the Loomis head construction method well and includes good instruction on perspective. These topics are covered more completely in his other books, but are appropriate for the subject of cartooning. Would have given it 4 stars if not for the sketchy print quality."
2,"Great Content, Crappy Presentation","The book is chopped-up scanned images of the original work. A lot of the pages are duplicates of others or slightly out of order and all are blurred.This is not a reflection on Loomis' content or instruction, both of which are fantastic. It's just that the printing is subpar. Not worth the $19 pricetag, considering you can download a pdf for free by googling it."
5,Tolkien's finest tale.,"Spare, solid, straightforward, honest--and enchanting. Devour it in an hour, savor it for a lifetime."
2,False advertising!,"This Papa minky was a huge disappointment. They advertise it as 54"" tall (6"" larger than their previous largest teddy bear) but the fact of the matter is that it is only 44"" tall. Upon contacting the manufacturer, they did not want to help me and they mentioned it is a ""custom measurment""??? and it is measured diagonally!!! We are not talking about a tv screen here! and when someone mentions 54"" tall, it is usually assumed it is going to be foot to ear! The second thing is that, they did not fill it it properly. At the waist, if i put it between my two fingers, there is no filling what so ever which makes it even shorter because the waist kind of bends. Sitting, it is barely 2 feet tall. I found bigger toys for $10 at our local flea market. Great disappointment. I am extremely pleased with the JUmbo Minky version which was massive and well worth the money. Just make sure you have space!!"
4,Great Bear,This is an amazing bear. The person who received it loves to cuddle with it every evening.
3,Deep dark truth: he's an album artist!,"John Hiatt's catalog has been put through the repackaging machine several times over the years, with some strange results... witness the not-quite-hits collection ""Ones That Got Away"", or the puzzling ""Best of John Hiatt"" (released on a label he'd only done one album for). This anthology tries to put things right by covering the whole shebang, but the reality is, Hiatt's work from the late 70's and early 80's is stylistically quite different from his better known, more recent work, and with the exception of Side Two of ""Riding With the King"", most of it doesn't measure up. So what's to be done? Well, you could start with 1987's ""Bring the Family"" and work your way forward, since everything he's done since then has been pretty terrific (except maybe ""Little Head""). Or, if you really just want two killer discs, I would personally suggest the A&M Greatest Hits set and ""Walk On""."
5,Terrific! Get this!,"One of the greats, John Hiatt is a writer's writer and singer's singer. If you're just starting to get to know his music, you're in luck, since this two-CD set is the cream of the crop, 40 delicious slices of warm, wry, sunny, sad Americana. I've been into Hiatt for years and bought many of his individual releases, all of which I recommend, but this pulls together his greatest, most essential recordings. For heaven's sake, don't buy a single disc of greatest hits when you can get so much more. I promise you will want more than just one CD of John's songs."
2,"A good idea, but poorly executed","First of all, this device is huge relative to the GBA, and heavy as well. When I take my GBA out with me, I like to put it in my pocket, but there's no way I can do that with this device saddled to the back. I end up using having to use regular AA batteries when I go out and this battery pak when I'm at home. Next, the clip on the battery pack that releases it is easy to hit by accident when you're playing a game. Finally, it only comes in one color, Indigo, which doesn't mesh so well with my Arctic GBA. Yes, it'll save you some money on batteries, but at the price of convenience, comfort, and appearance."
4,Ok,"This thing is really good, only takes about half an hour (for me) to change the color of the power to almost out to green. Yeah, these things can slip out (hate it when I was in a middle of a game, lost a good win), but at least it can last a long time. The charger should have a light to tell if the battery is fully charged or you will lose some power, maybe. It can be an AC adapter, which means you don't need to buy an AC adapter separately. Wish they had a kind for AAA batteries, so I can use it for my lightshield instead of wasting my Duracell Ultra batteries.So mainly:Pros:Lasts for a long timeRechargableCan act like an AC adapterCan last for over 10 hrs.Cons:Can pop out of your gameboy sometimesShakesFlickers the light from green to redMakes the gameboy heavierTakes the whole battery slot (uncomfortable for some)"
2,Too bulky,"I bought a GBA and accessory kit for a friend I was visiting in France and the 10-hour rechargable power pack fit the game perfectly. When I got home from my vacation, my game and kit had already arrived from pre-ordering it before I left. This battery pack has a 20 hour promise, but it's just too bulky to enjoy. Now I'll have to ...purchase another pack that will fit in the carrying case. I'm not impressed."
4,Useful Charger,"I really like this item(i have the color in glacier). It has lasted the longest next to my other charger packs. And it has an AC adapter for unlimited gameplay. the draw-back is that it is kind of heavy, yet i kind of like that. The red light flickers all the time too, so i end up shuting off my game, even though it was fine. Besides that, i think it is one of the best charger paks."
1,Don't fall for this!,This product for the gameboy advanced is just as good as a piece of dirt.Do not buy this!When I bought it I thought it would work great. But after a week of use it burnt it self out.All of my friends had the same problem.It also only will hold a hour's worth of power.Its just a waste of money.You are better off buying batteries.
4,A Very Useful Item,"This power pak is a handy thing to have. It really saves on expensive batteries. However, there are some changes I wish they would make on this in the future. I wish they would add an indicator to show you how far charged it is so, A) you know how much longer to leave it plugged in when re-charging and B) you know how much juice you have left before it poops out on you in the middle of a game. I, also, wish they'd make the battery part smaller/lighter weight. It is a little cumbersome on the small Game Boy Advance unit. All in all, however, I would highly recommend having one or two of these around."
4,Much Better than the 812,"This board has much better quality than the 812 Drueke bd. Still not as good as they used to make them, but what is now a days? I have had a bd made by Drueke for over 30 years. It's made of oak this one is made of pine but still isn't too bad."
3,AN UNFINISHED PROJECT...,"Some photos are memorable and give honour to the talented photographer but there does not seem to be any integrity at all, the book is nothing more than a collection of photographic notes taken in different lands. A number of images have nothing to do with christianity at all. The camera is often more excited about sects and cults. Very subjective views and written statements, too shallow for such a serious subject. A project like this should take a lifetime to complete..."
2,Very thin,"You can easily see through these sheets. They are very thin. However, they were the size I needed and this size is hard to find. The cost of shipping equaled $20 for 2 bottom fitted sheets -- too much for the quality of this item."
3,How to be a man and enjoy this movie,"This movie, based on an Almudena Grandes novel, is a tribute to women all around. Carmen Maura is the wife of a man that cheat on her and a son in the process to grow... a tragedy changed her forever. This comedy has great moments of laugh, but the book is much better. I think in some levels the director misunderstood the novel, Almudena Grandes is a feminist who believe that women are not better than men, they're even and in this movie goes in the inverse. Other movies based on an Almudena novel are ""Cuernos de mujer"" y ""How to be unhappy and enjoy it""."
4,Busy woman on the edge of a nervous...,"It is the story of a modern woman with a mediocre husband and the numerous challenges of the everyday life. At times this movie is very entertaining, at times a bit boring, exactly like life itself. Without the geniality and the glamour of Almodovar's films, but still fun to watch."
4,dvd,haven't checked up to now- therefore can't give you response. But I was told the articel was satisfactory. PH
5,New or Questioning Christian - This Book is For You!,"I've been a Christian for approximately 50 years. Twenty years ago I was asked to leave the church (not God or Christianity) because I am a lesbian. Eleven months ago I walked into a church that accepted me as a child of God - Eugenia Price's book, What Really Matters? was important to me because it helped me understand some of the questions I am dealing with now. For Christian's at any stage in their spiritual life, this book will be a comfort, a joy, bring peace and understanding of ourselves and others in this world. I highly recommend it!"
5,a great variety of chocolate cookies,"This book has every imaginable kind of chocolate cookie that is worth making. So far, the recipes that I have tried make fantastic cookies. Perfect for both the everyday cookie baker and those who just need to make the occasional batch around the holidays."
4,The Ultimate Chocolate Cookie Book,There are some fantastic chocolate chip recipes in this book. They are yummy. My husband even made some of them.
4,Ok Deal on Sale But There Are Better.,"First, they don't have a ""lifetime"" warranty because Amazon is not an authorized dealer. They have a five year ""limited"" warranty.Second, cheap watches do not have to look cheap. Unfortunately, this one does. The dial looks cheap and so does the bezel. The movement is loose inside the case when the crown is out. The band is rough, ugly, and yes, cheap. It has a screw down back but no screw down crown. After a month or two it is unlikely it will be water resistant in the shower much less at 100 meters. If it keeps good time it will be fine as a beater watch but don't expect to impress anyone at your next social gathering. Croton makes some really nice and well crafted watches but they also have several low end lines and though not at the bottom this one is close. I got mine on Amazons Friday Sale so I got an Ok deal. For the full price, Amazon has a number of watches that would be a much better deal."
3,looking for the warrenty...,"For the price it is hard to complain, but as I look at the watch right now and get irritated with the condensation build-up in the center of the face, I have to pass it on. This is a flimsy watch. Don't be fooled with the mark down, as I don't believe it is worth more than the $30, you commonly see. You get what you pay for.Cheers!!"
1,"Boring, sloppy.. a waste of time","As much has already been written about the Master Butchers Singing Club this review is going to be very short. In holding with the previous critques, I agree that there are way too many overburdened plotlines carelessly jumbled together, a misleading title and all in all too much pathos. In the end I skipped through the pages, eager to wrap the story up! What I found extremely unnerving, too, was that Erdrich lets her German characters interject a few remarks here and there in their mother tongue. Only, why is it that their German is so unnatural, stiff and not once orthographically correct (""Wir haben verheiraten"")? Maybe it is a question of cultural assimilation or, and this seems to be more like it, Erdrich just didn't take the time to go over the pages of her book once more after finishing (neither did her editors) and simply didn't bother to render an authentic novel!"
5,Excellent - one of Erdrich's best,"A wonderful story of life, love, and sacrafice without any of the sap. Gender, loss, the maladies that plague the human spirit."
4,Normal People,"Erdrich has a good sense of the German immigrant: his stoicism, fatalism and ambition to succeed. Underlying the surface the ""normal"" surface the immigrant presents the world is a sensitivity, passion, and emotional intensity that is rarely seen. Secrets abound and weirdness, pain, and death are always just around the corner."
4,Very good; can't put it down after getting into it,"The plot twists and turns make it very interesting. It was hard to get into at the beginning, but I kept at it because it's a Book Group read. But after the early pages, it becomes very interesting. The plot keeps going in unexpected directions and characters change from minor to major during certain parts. Liked it a lot."
3,misleading title,"The story was okay. The title did not have a much to do with the story. In fact, it was misleading. I was bored on occasions with the characters. They seemed to do they same thing many times."
4,Good reading.,"Good fiction read, well written, and enjolyed the characters.Look forward to another book by this author, and hope that it is soon."
4,good book,"Good story, as usual, but not my favorite by this author. I would still recommend to others and passed it on."
2,Where's the beef?,"I'm trying to enjoy this book but can't get connected to the characters enough to want to finish reading it. To me, they're not enjoyable, empathetic, scary, smart, clever, or even interesting. This book was suggested by two respected readers who enjoyed it. Maybe it's just me, but I won't pass the accolades along. And, yes, I will finish reading it."
4,Very Entertaining Read!,I loved this book. It's characters were so off the beaten track that it reminded me of some of John Irving's works (Hotel New Hampshire). Great character development and unpredictable events. This book hooked me right from the beginning.
4,The Mystery That Is Louise Erdich,"I just finished another book by Louise Erdich. She writes such peaceful, hopeful books. They have a sadness to them that is respectable. There is always a surprising truth at the end of her stories that only the reader, but not the characters, know. The litte truths at the end of the story never quite make sense of everything, they just make sense. There is a mystery in her stories, but not the painful tension that makes books exhausting. There is something in each character that makes you feel like you'll survive your own flaws; that maybe you're OK afterall. And there's always a bit of a history lesson in the stories, too. A history lesson you didn't know we needed to hear."
3,Good but runs out of steam,"I thought this was a good book - plenty of interesting characters and situations and an interesting writing style, but I couldn't help get the feeling that the author got tired of writing it. It lost it's steam towards the last 1/3 or so of the book. It goes into ""fast forward"" mode and the important relationships that are formed and intense happenings are merely skimmed over. The characters became impersonal and therefore hard to identify with.Great potential of a book that unfortunately lost it's steam towards the end."
4,Family trees,"I hope that Master Butchers is the beginning of a new set of novels intertwining Delphine, Fidelus, and Cyprian's families in the way Erdrich wove and embroidered tales of her Ojibwe ancestors. That the writing is by turns stark, poetic, and convoluted fits with my own experiences of family story-telling and family secrets of the Great Plains and the Great Depression. The book may not be for those who lack the patience and curiosity to listen at family reunions."
3,Patchwork,"This book was a bit of disappointment. I expected more substance --- if you will forgive the pun --- I expected more meat. It was like a patchwork quilt with bright areas of excellent word-crafting and insight,while the rest was just old worn material. It wasn't unpleasant reading. I was just left with the thought, ""Was this the whole story?"""
3,Held my interest right 'til the end -- then a big disappointment!,"I enjoyed this book right up until the end -- and then sat and thought, ""Huh?"" The ending seems disconnected to everything else in the book and provides no resolution or link to any previous story line. I liked the book a lot as I was reading it, and often re-read anything I like. But I cannot bring myself to pick this book up a second time because I remember how disappointing the ending is, how interesting characters are suddenly tossed aside or never returned to because......I have no idea why! I don't know what the goal of this book was and the title is certainly not related to anything of great impact in the book. Many people loved this and maybe I just missed something. But my advice is don't start because the ending is too little, too late, too pointless."
4,Interesting Characters - beautiful descriptions,"Great storytelling - I did not want the book to end. I was a bit let down by the disarrayed ending, but the characters - especially Ciprian and Eva - are so full of life and detail I felt I knew them personally. I recommend this highly."
2,Not worth the time,"Erdrich tells a compelling story about memorable characters--Delphine and Cyprian, Eva and Fidelis--coping with trouble in between-the-wars North Dakota. But the prose is mostly unbearable, filled with sentimentality and unnecessary modifiers. This is a tale that would have benefited from sparer language, reflecting the harsh life these characters must have faced."
3,This book has very little to do with men,"Although not a terrible use of one's time, this book promises far too much in the title than it delivers. Two of my friends read it and I was supposed to cast the deciding vote. Gong, but only because I'm not all that interested in the real topic of the book."
5,Depth of Emotions,"Excellent read, rich characters, intriguing plot. After WW I, immigrents to the US find their way to ND and struggle to succeed in a small town. The characters are woven together in such a unique way, the reader is kept moving along, intensly engaged in their lives and emotions as if they are family members. The authors' unusual plot twists and steadfast characters make this an interesting and captivating read."
4,The Master Butchers,"I had not read any other books by this author yet but was intrigued by the description of this book. Several book club friends were not enthusiastic but I ordered it anyway and I'm happy I did.I really enjoy colorful characters and this book supplied just enough without overdoing the ""John Irving"" approach. The main character won my heart and the profile of the 2nd son was very believable.I wouild recommend!"
4,Wonderful. Close to perfect.,"This is a wonderful tapestry of fascinating quirky characters. The descriptions of surroundings are like a painting without every being tedious. I loved this book. The only disappointing thing was that no one ever gets to be happy in this book -- well maybe the love between Fidelis & Eva comes close. Since life is made of real joy, as well as sadness, after a while the constant disappointment seems contrived. BUT that is a small small complaint. I really love these oddball complex characters. I think this one will stay with me a while."
3,They are ok,I Know I can't expect very much since I did'nt pay much for this item. I am a little disappointed that when I washed them the velcro seems to be tearing off.
3,"Good subject, average writing, poor editing","This book should be re-written to present the information in a better fashion. The author has some really good information which is pretty convincing. However, many points are not proven clearly enough and opposing viewpoints are at times brushed over without emphatic refutation. Some of the worst points about the book are that some important information or suppositions are buried in the text. There are also signs of abrupt transitions in thinking and theme. Some of the wording is not clear or un-edited. The word 'briefer' appears in the text and at time certain words (like 'certain') appear in the same sentence twice where alternate wording should have been used.The only way you could see no value in the book is if you have a completely closed mind and hold a fundamentalist/literal view of creation or by taking the evolutionary belief system which holds no interaction of God in directing the creation."
5,"Scientists and creationists, put away the buggy whips!","Dr. Ross's book shows that Moses anticipated the findings of modern science. Scientists are only now realizing that the universe was created a finite time ago. It is not infinitely old.So you don't have to check your brains at the door to be a devout Christian, Jew or Muslim. On the contrary, you have a head start!"
4,Follows in the footsteps of previous books,"Like all of Dr Ross's books, this one gives a very good explanation of the cohesion between the Bible and Science. I recommend it as well as ""Creation and Time"" and ""The Creator and the Cosmos"".P.S. If you'll notice, most of the anti-Young-Earth-Creationist reviews have been given ""this review is not helpful"" marks by many readers, and most of the pro-YEC reviews (and therefore anti-Dr-Ross reviews) have been given ""this review is helpful"" marks. Take those ratings with a pillar of salt (a-HA!) because it's a result of ""stuffing the ballot box"" by the pro-YEC crowd. (I expect this review to get a bunch of ""not helpful"" marks too...)"
1,The Genesis Question:Scientific Advances and the Accuracy of,"perhaps the author can explain why his ""loving"" lord and creator would have created carniverous animals including homo sapiens. Also, why would he allow millions to kill each other over religious differences, i.e. Moslem against jews, christians against moslems, moslems against Buddhists and so on. And why this insignificant spec of dust in the vast universe as his choice to ""create"" man, a very imperfect planet, 75% covered by water, the rest desert or ice covered with little left for land creatures to develop?"
1,"What's True's Not New, What's New's Not True","Thanks to the author for bringing to our attention both true things and new things.Regrettably, what is true isn't new, and what is new isn't true."
1,This man does not know hebrew/greek or science,"Another book by Hugh Ross is not needed. The man is inept when it comes to the Biblical languages as was proved when in a debate he was asked by Russel Humphreys if he spoke hebrew. Dr. Humphreys asked this in hebrew and Hugh Ross had no idea what was said. Dr. Ross also fails to take into consideration his theological contradictions in his reasoning. A book outlining the theological errors of believing Dr. Ross is: Creation and Time: A Report on the Progressive Creationist Book by Hugh Ross, the authors are Mark Van Bebber & Paul S. Taylor. This is a much better book. ...Do not waste any more time with the logical errors of Hugh Ross"
1,Awful...,"On the surface, Hugh Ross's book ""The Genesis Question"" seems to be very impressive, with a great deal of figures and information. However, closer scrutiny of his reasoning and data shows just how wrong he is. Hugh Ross does not do science OR religion justice with this book, as he relies on specious reasoning, inaccurate data, and misleading interpretations of facts to arrive at his conclusions, much as many young-earth creationists do. Before buying this book, I suggest reading a review of it by G.R. Morton, also a Christian believer, who points out the numerous flaws in logic and fact far better than I....Ultimately, his book gives false reasons for people to believe in the ""inerrancy"" of the Bible, and provides ammunition for people who are already suspicious of Christians who are trying to make sense of the world through science."
1,A Transparent and Disengenuous Juggling Act,"Having read this book, I can conclude that anyone with an elementary familiarity with either the Bible or science will see at once that Hugh Ross is juggling facts and opinions in order to develop his story. In fact, Ross is even slippery: On one hand he denies believing in evolution, while on other pages in the book he says that plants may have developed naturalistically. Now if that is not organic evolution, then what is? Ross' other claims also tell us much more about his imagination than they do about either science or religion. For instance, were they alive today, I am sure that Neandertals and members of Homo erectus would be thrilled to learn that they only seem human but are really not, and that they are soul-less pre-Adamites."
5,"The Polynesian Family System in Ka'u, Hawai'i","Excellent non fiction portrayal of everyday life in a true paradise. Written by a great team; Dr. Handy, an emminent anthropologist and authority on religion; and Mrs Puki , the grand old lady of Hawian studies. Both are full time Hawiians and write directly from their own experience in simple, jargon free language. Best of its kind, true, and a pleasure to read!"
1,Big elephant in the room that is being ignored...,"It's funny...all of this antipathy towards the public education system without the assessment of the fact the the RELIGIOUS RIGHT has taken over many of the country's school districts (and city councils) in their efforts to control what kids learn. Their takeover's benchmark is moving the system itself towards utter bankruptcy, thereby leaving a huge hole for the corporations to fill. This has led to the problem of, frankly, stupid children who are crass, mindless consumers who also have 30-second attention spans. Perfect for the church that wants humans who are easy to control (hence, the lack of ability of these young people to think for themselves), and for corporations who want unquestioning consumers. Shame on this author for exclusively blaming teachers and other ""lobbyists"" -- they are a part of the problem, but not the instigators/creators of the problems."
3,Changes since 1950 - Cause & Effect Plus Solutions,"Bood book but aside from the divorce rate, racial integration of our schools, the introduction of the welfare state, drug abuse culture, which have impacted our schools / culture / life and which we can't change, here are the things that have changed in our schools since 1950 that we might want to change back.- coed class rooms- lax dress code- corporal punishment- unionized teachersI wonder at the impact of a school lottery system in which the bottom 10 percent of any SAT, ACT, Literacy test takers are put into a lottery pool and the top 100 winners get two weeks the next summer they are sent off to a boot camp. A separate boot camp would be set up for the worst discipline offenders of the prior year.Then again, a lottery to take drop outs and put 10 in each state into the army for 4 years. Powerful motivation not to drop out, though I am sure the Army will not enjoy trying to fix societies problems."
3,do more homework,"I only want to encourage the reader to seek additional information on the assessment that the Ed.D. is an inferior degree to the Ph.D. The author should seek additional references and research on this subject. While some schools require less technical dissertations and possibly one or two fewer courses (6 semester hours), many schools treat the two degrees as valid research designations. Regardless, calling a doctoral degree inferior is a statement against a particular school, not the degree designation."
1,one more step you'd fall...,"This book is horrible. You'd be wondering where the editor had been. There are big and small typos all over, really annoying. The authors seem not too sure about integer division nor switch statements fall through, they got it totally wrong. One third of the way through it you'd be wondering why the heck you spent 30 dollars for. The book does indicate what to do but not how, even it does it's not clear either.A lot of times you are typing in some code and you DON'T actually learn something useful, not if you are completely new to programming. However if you as a beginner insist reading on you will learn a lot of fuzzy concepts. C++/java guys should stay clear.Definitely NOT recommended.(Actually I begin to suspect how MS Press contract authors -- anyone who can write something regardless the quality produced)"
2,Could be much better...could be worse....,"This was the first C# book I studied and thought that I just couldn't comprehend some concepts.....until I got another book--Mastering Visual C#.NET, which is MUCH BETTER.Then I realized that I wasn't me, it was how the author presented (or not presented) the information. And with all the errors in the programs, it was harder to know what was right and what was wrong.Granted, there is a lot of information to give and a person CAN actually learn some of it from this book but I would suggest, try another book."
2,"Great introduction to C#, but then...","This book is primarily an extensive series of exercises with some explanatory text in between. It reads easily and does a good job of explaining the basics of C#. The more advanced topics (Web, Data) are covered so poorly that you might as well skip them.Unfortunately it is very poorly suited as a reference: there is no explanation of the C# classes, control properties and the index is for all practical purposes worthless.Consider ""C# - The Complete Reference"" if you want a more complete book.And yes, the errors are annoying."
2,Too easy and then too hard,"... I guess the first half is written by one author and the 2nd half is by another author. If anything new appears in the first half, you are given a brief explanation so that you can move on. However, many new concept/terminologies simply emerge from the middle of nowhere with no context what so ever. Then I have to dig into other books like C# Bible(good one) to get the answer. I am experienced in C, with some knowledge in C++."
4,"Excellent tutorial, slight change would give it 5 stars","This is an excellent training book/CD-ROM. Much better than the CD-ROM's that have a bunch of animations and talking boxes, and then a bunch of multiple choice questions at the end of the lesson. At first I was taken back by the approach of having to read and then perform exercises. But this method works best. It allows you to get to the meat of coding in C#. And by providing a fully usable version of Visual .Net C#, you don't feel like you are getting much more than just training material. The only thing I would change is to put the code that you should have generated from their descriptions after each lesson, instead of right underneath the description. This way, if you wanted, you could just follow the descriptions and see if you came up with the solution without having to put a piece of paper over the code after each description. Other than that, I can think of a more clear concise approach to learning C# and .Net."
3,A Good Start,"This was the first C# book that I've ever read. It gave me a good start in learning the language. In fact, the material covered in the book is exactly what the introductory Microsoft C# course covers. I only recommend this book for absolute beginners and for Java developers who want to learn C#."
4,AN ALL-ROUND GOOD GUIDE,"""Microsoft Visual C# .NET Step by Step"" is the book to grab if you want an easy way of circumventing all the hassles that most newcomers face in this subject. The authors of this book did a good job in providing practical step-by-step guide. All the staple fundamentals are available; and some simplified advanced materials are included. For self-test purposes, useful Code samples were also included in the attached CD-ROM. This is an all-round quality guide.However, if you are a beginner with no basic knowledge of Microsoft Visual C++ or Visual Basic, be aware that this book may have little patience for you."
3,C# Step By Step,"The book starts out with excellent high level examples. The book claims to be a good starting point for beginning programmers new to C# and OOP in general. I think this is a far-reaching assumption. The book relies heavily on the users past programming experience and understanding of OOP. A great start for experienced OOP programmers who need to move to C#, but I would not recommend for the beginner."
3,Save Time for the Errata,"If you don't have programming experience and want a ""point & click"" type of book to help you learn .NET and C#, then this is a pretty good book. However, I spent over 2 hours correcting the numerous errors made by the author, some of which where rediculously basic. Unfortunately, it's typical Microsoft ... just ship it out and let the paying beta testers sort out the problems.There are better books out there. I recommend Microsoft Visual C#.NET. I know its still a Microsoft book, but it really is rather good."
5,A C# book that actually delivers,"Too often books are either too hard by going into the subject and assuming you already know C#, or too simple by explaining a language as if you've never programmed before. This book is just right as it explains C# without insulting you on what a loop means. One thing I really liked about this book is that while it quickly shows you how to use Visual Studio.NET it doesn't pretend to be a VS.NET tutorial like how many .NET books do, including many Microsoft books. If you want a VS.NET tutorial go buy Visual Studio Step by Step or similar."
2,Watches International 2001,"I was very disappointed. The major brands are not well represented at all (with few exceptions) and too much space was given to jewelry/fashion watches for which serious collectors are not likely to be that interested. Perhaps comprehensive inclusion of the major companies required their financial participation. If so, they obviously opted out. A slick publication way off the mark. Could be much, much better."
3,more flash than cash,"The book is beautifully published and photographed. It offers a good review of the history of watchmaking, especially helpful to the novice collector or the casual reader. The second tier and exotic bejewelled brands are catalogued in great detail over several pages each, but the Grande Marques watches such as Breguet, Cartier, Franck Muller, IWC, Omega, Ulysse Nardin and Vacheron Constantin are given a cursory overview in about a couple pages for each. As is customary for this publication, no retail prices are quoted.This significantly detracts from its usefulness and value to the serious watch collector. It is an interesting coffee table book, but more useful catalogues for the watch afficionado are Wristwatch Annual 2001 and Watches vol.4"
3,Not as good as I hoped,"This was an album that I saw was cheap, so I bought it. I'm glad I only paid $3.50 for it. It's okay, but I've heard way better. If you like generic hardcore then get this album."
3,Could've been better.....,"whoever eq'd certain parts of this album needs to be slapped. I took out 1 star for poor production, and one for performance. The vocals on the title track where Mike tries to sound like Alex from Atreyu are irritating, just 'cause Scars is way better than Atreyu, they shouldn't be influenced by them. Also, the Caliban-style overproduced clean vocals on a few of the tracks. As far as production goes, The Horror of Realization sounded way, way better. The kick drum's slap it way too high pitched on the album. It's more than likely a sound replaced kick using a trigger, but the kick they chose to use just sucks. The guitars are way, way too bassy to the point that when I listen to the beginning of Nashville through my studio monitors, it crackles all over the place. The rest of the drums sound great, musically this album is about on-par w/ their last. Love these guys to death, just hope their next effort is mixed better......"
5,Beautiful.............,"I had the joyous privilege to hear Secret Garden at a live performance last night--their premier concert in the US. Of course, I bought the CD. I love the diversity--Celtic exuberance woven with Nordic soulfullness. There is only one jarring note to the selections--but, perhaps it was included in a spirit of mischievousness."
5,Awesome!,"I was in a foul mood when the box containing the CD arrived on my desk. Twenty minutes later I was sobbing, the music washing through me and cleansing the pain. There is something primal about this music. I heard snippets from the CD on the radio as their Omaha concert was advertized, and decided to buy it based on the pieces I had heard. I have no hesitation to recommend it to anyone I know who loves music. It will be featured on my Christmas list this year."
5,My Favorite CD to relax to.,"Beautiful vocals, relaxing melodies, this is the perfect CD to give as a gift to a friend! This is another CD to burn your CD play up with! :)"
4,Dawn of a new Century...,It's very surprising and amazing that the former winner of the Grand Prix Eurovision Songs Contest have such a success in the U.S. If you have seen Riverdance you'll remain some commonship. My favorite Secret Garden Album will still be White Stones.
3,Secret Garden: Dawn of a New Century,"This CD is great: it takes you everywhere from the Celtic era to a heavenly choir. But, like all good things, I think it has it's faults. I feel many of the songs lack proper endings, like they just cut off. Still, the music is beautiful, and grips your heart and soul."
1,Beware: Not For Everyone,"John Tesh collection maxxed out? Want something more celtic-y than your Michael Bolton records? Real celtic music a little raw for your tastes? This might be the album for you! To those of you who listen primarily to classical or jazz, do not buy this album. Purchase Loreena McKennitt instead. This album is banal, jejune, overly sentimental, and downright insipid. Hit the mute button at any time and I guarantee you will be able to finish the phrase. It is unfailingly predictable and cliche-ridden. Don't worry about these two, they're laughing all the way to the bank. I feel chagrined at being suckered into buying this album by the gushing reviews in this space, and hope to help others avoid the same fate. They get one star for the effort it takes to get your music out to a mass audience."
2,BOR-ING!,zzzzzzz boy that album will put ya to sleep! how mopey and depressing can you be! It was so boring. It doesnt even compare to the first to cd's with the exception of song #2.
5,Heavenly,"Just turn out the light and press play.If you don't fall into a trance and then a peaceful sleep, you will get to hear the final track which is probably the most anthemic track you could wish to hear. And then, if you have made it to the end of the CD, you'll just press 'Play' again, and again, and again............."
4,"Lush, peaceful, dreamy.","""Once in a Red Moon"" is how I discovered the sounds of Secret Garden. Immediately I fell in love with the lush, peaceful and dreamy sounds this duo has become so famous for. The only reason I don't give this CD 5 stars is purely for subjective reasons - I don't think it's their best, but I still think it is definitely worth owning. You'll enjoy it, I'm certain. Every time we play any of Secret Garden's music in our radio broadcast, they are one of the very few groups that stay in our programming as long as they do, because listeners love them so much. A good buy for your collection. Jon"
3,"Good resource material, with reservations","In 1927, the 900th anniversary of the birth of William I, a plaque was unveiled at Falaise which listed the names of 406 men supposed to have been companions of the Conqueror. Several more books and numerous articles have been published for and against any such list, but -- infighting aside -- this is still a good source for brief sketches of a large number of Norman and Breton nobles and adventurers. Ignore Crispin's arguments and conclusions, if you like, and use the heavily-footnoted sketches as a biographical dictionary of the long-term Norman conquest."
4,To be considered very carefully.,"This books gives an insight into the Qu'ran and the Islamic religion. It is broken into sections that explain various aspects of life using the spritual and life practice guidance of the Koran. The author repeatly explains that the laws and language of the Koran is misinterpreted yet one cannot help but feel he is rationalizing. Still, I believe we get a good sense of Islamic law and the Koran, and frankly, some of the core concepts make much sense as the true words brought forth by Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Mohammed. I have bought a translation of the Qu'ran and following the reading of Dummies, will begin to tackle it. I would suggest to readers to find other sources to compare and contrast opinions; The complexities of the Islamic tradition need to be examined through the eyes of more than one source."
4,Steve Dexter,"I bought ""the Koran for Dummies"" because I needed a companion to guide me through a reading of the Quran (alternative spelling) in order to assess the many claims that wing nuts on the web have been passing around around concerning Islam and Moslems. I figured that if I had a better understanding of the Quran I could either accept or reject/modify those claims. So far (I have read only seven chapters) the book has been excellent and has given me a better understanding of the links of the Quran to the Torah and the Bible as well as those areas where it differs from them. To date I have yet to find any written passages that would justify the extremist behavior of Islamist terrorists. More Americans need to read this book and the Quran so that we can quell reactionary behavior among some of our fellow Americans and to facilitate a more tolerant and accepting attitude toward other world religions."
2,Title and content dont match. Islam for Dummies couldn't be much different,"I expected a better book from dummies. The Author has tried to preach Islam, detailed the different sects of Muslims and their differences which are much beyond the scope of the study of Quran (Koran). I wish the author had stuck to Quran and its proper interpretation.The tips and facts are good but the supportive material is lengthy. The author sways away from the topic.The author has been awe struck by the magnanimity of the project and limited by the limitation of his knowledge and grasp of the subject"
1,Koran for real dummies who can't think,"For the first time since buying a book on-line I was tempted to wrap it up and send it back, this book was that terrible. It went out of its way to avoid any negativity or criticism about the Koran or about Moslems, whether mainstream or fanatical. This is a very sanitized version of this holy book, and unobjective to the extreme. I was searching for true meanings of the Koran elements but reading this version was a complete waste of time."
1,This book is very misleading,"I really hope people will read the real Koran and not this politically correct white wash!The real Koran is FILLED with threats, cursings, and just plain hatred towards disbelievers (= non muslims). In fact, that is a majority of Koranic contents! The Surahs of violent threats and curses (against disbelievers) are written out in every chapter of the Koran. Repeatedly!!Any fair minded reader would conclude that the Koran is a book of hatred towards Jews, Christians, or non muslims in general. The Koran TEACHES people to kill non muslims. That is not hatred??How can this 'dummy' book ignore all that?? I am usually a fan of 'Dummies' book. But unfortunately this is not an accurate overview of the Koran."
1,What a crock of bull,"As an ex-muslim, I checked this because a friend said I should read it.What I discovered is a complete load of manure. Either the author has never read the Koran, does not understand Arabic, or else is deliberately trying to whitewash this hateful, vile, violent religion.This is like a book on Scientology written by a brainwashed scientologist, nothing more and nothing less. He should be ashamed for lying like this - but of course, lying to infidels is okay if it gets them to convert!"
2,This reads like a thesis,"I would recommend this book stay in the professional field for the experts looking for corriculum, data, and findings. I purchased this book because the Occupational Therapist my 2 year old visits weekly suggested I read up on ""The Clumsy Child.""I found this book on Amazon. It reads more like a Master's Thesis than it does a book to help parents understand their children who suffer from clumsiness. It defined some things for me that I was not fully understanding, but I didn't find it helpful as a parent relating to a Clumsy Child."
5,the last mug you will ever need.,"For the price an performance this mug can't be beaten. Nice depth and width, you can whip up a bushel of lather quickly. If you like a short handled brush this might not be the mug for you. For everyone else order one today. You will not regret it."
3,I liked the material but design is lacking,The hard rubber material is good but the cup size is off as a puck of WVF soap doesn't fit properly at the bottom as there is some sort of raised inner ring. It looks as if it was designed for a specific soap product.
2,What about regular folk?,"I found it a bit hard to relate to the author on this one--she's a high-paid executive who can afford to hire nannies, housekeepers, landscapers, etc. It's a bit easier to have balance when you have money. It would be great to see a book by a regular parent that had some tips in it."
2,Not too good,I have a 150 gallon tank and kept having my ph rebound. I had to use almost the whole bottle and I don't think I was supposed to. Ended up buying proper ph 7 and that seems to be doing the trick.
2,temporary fix,"It didn't really change the ph levels at all. I was hoping that the lowering of the ph from this stuff would keep the ph low. I would put it in new water when I did my water changes, and it didn't really do anything. I put massive amounts in each gallon of water to try and permanently lower the ph in each gallon. It didn't last though. I monitored a gallon jug of water and less than 24 hours after putting 10 ml of ph down in 1 gallon jug of water the ph levels were back up to almost what they were before. I know this is because my water is so hard but it just wasn't enough. If you are looking to lower the levels, get Fluval peat moss extract instead. Put that in a media bag and drop it in your canister or power filter and it will have a more positive long term effect on your ph level. One box lasts for several months with positive effects."
5,Works as advertised,"It seems pricey, but I use about 2 teaspoons for my 72 gallon bow tank when I do 80% (roughly) water changes.However it does only what it says. If you have PH bounce or other issues, then you have other aquarium chemicalissues that need addressing. Test the ph of your pure tap water to see which way you'll usually have to movethe PH.It is concentrated, so add it AFTER you've added the water to treat, otherwise you'll see your fish freak outas they get hit with a blast of acid. Usually I put it in a gallon jug, fill it with water, then dump that in.Just use the recommended amount; then wait about 20 minute before testing again, then add more if necessary."
4,overall good cd,the latest from anointed is very good. a surprising urban turn for them. but they never stray far from the gospel. songs are of quality and taste. buy this cd
1,"This cd does not seem to sound like your ""normal"" gospel cd.","Most of the songs do not sound like gospel. They have one good song titled ""Angels"". And there are a few desent ones, but they are not that great."
5,Sharpe Pointed Needle,"There's funny. There's hysterical, like Blott and his capers & then there's ""The Throwback"".Twenty years on and there are still very few books to rival this witty, saucy tale of societal & bureaucratic bedevelment, stitching family, needling neighbours and machining the powers that be, alike. I only wish I had the ability to tinker (tailored of course) with multi-nationals in the same game. Like others before me, all my copies of this book have mysteriously never returned. I have never seen a 2nd-hand copy for sale; New is now a myth; and so I have found solace in Harry Harrison's Stainless Steel Rat traps. Best of luck keeping your copy."
4,Tom Sharpes' sadistic humor will amuse and startle...,"Tom Sharpe, the author of ""The Wilt Alternative"" and ""Porterhouse Blue"" Takes an even stranger turn than one would expect from his previous works. The ""Hero"" of our story, Lockhart Flawes, is an idiot savant with a talent for electronics, demolition and sharpshooting, which he uses to the most amazing ends in this sometimes quiet, sometimes hilarious and always strange work. If you are unfamilliar with Sharpes' writting, beware. Sharpe has the amazing ability to lure the reader into his worlds, and then turn them inside out. This book does just that. (I would not reccomend this book for the squemish, however)."
4,The Throwback by Tom Sharpe,"This is the hilariously funny saga of a young man who has no official existence, and who is totally naive concerning the facts of life. About other things he has a good grasp of the way they work, and when he settles down with his new bride, and his new bride's mother settles down with her new husband, things start to pop. It is difficult to say more without spoiling the plot, but suffice it to say that the plot, like the contents of the Dutch Cap, will keep, and you will be in stitches, unlike the Colonel'sScarlet Lady.This is not a book to take to read on an airplane. It is so uproarously funny that you might well find the flight diverted and escorted to the ground by fighters, and you packed off for observation. You have been warned."
4,Tom Sharpe at his hilarious best.,"The adventures of Lockhart Flawse (The Bastard) as he is known to his Grandfather who is his sole family. Watch as he grows and matures, experiences life, love and loss.One of Tom Sharpe's wittiest. i laughed out loud a few times, but mostly sniggered at Lockhart's exploits, his Grandfather's views on everything and Dodd Flawse Hall's jack-of-all-trades.If you are new to Tom Sharpe, 'The Throwback' would be a good start to a life long love of this author. If you are an old friend ... enjoy."
1,Defective,"It seems that AudioVox stopped making these years ago. But they sit on the shelves of many shops, just rotting and waiting.The one I bought was completely dead. No continuity, no signal, nothing. I can't even get a sat meter to register background noise when I try to power this up.If you buy one, be sure to test it right away. Don't wait like I did until the ""product return window"" closed."
5,Perfect Replacement for Dish Network LNB,"Sun and temperature extremes caused the white plastic cap to crack on my original LNB that was installed 9 years ago on an 18"" satellite dish. I was getting sporadic loss of signal for a couple weeks, and it eventually went to complete signal loss. Rainwater had dripped into the area where the circuit board is located and fried it. Even though this is a different brand it fits perfectly in the bracket. My old OEM LNB was a single, this dual works the same, you just hook it up to one fitting. This is less expensive than buying a used LNB on eBay.NOTE: This works with the 18"" legacy (original) 18"" dish, I'm not sure if this would work for Dish 500 or newer set-ups. It should be OK with older DirecTV units also as they are interchangeable."
5,A must play,"this game has a good length, and fun to play and figure out when your bored. good for kids 8 and up (im 9) i strongly recommend it to zelda fans, plus master quest is a good bonus to! although it is a little bit expensive, so get it at gamestop or some place like that. Link moves slow though. if you like this game, try this one. -)The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker"
4,Amazing Transfer from the N64 to the GameCube!,"I really like this game! IT'S AWESOME!!!! The graphics are a lot clearer, brighter, and crisper than the N64 version! The sound was breath-taking! The vibrations in the controller was stronger, eliminating the use of a Rumble Pak! But, the GameCube control takes some time getting used to, though.Even though it was a great game, it disappointed me some. I only gave it 4 stars because I really thought that it should have included Majora's Mask (my favorite Zelda game in the whole world), than the crappy Master Quest thing. I hope, like this game, they make a re-release of Majora's Mask for the GameCube very soon!"
3,good but,It's a old n64 games master quest is okay but I did'nt get the case or the manual just a pink round case
5,"zelda on gc, times two","only a few words for you. legend of zelda ocarian of time is a must get game. i will put it this way for ya. i owned this game, it got stollen from me from someone else who liked it and i just bought another copy. there is a reason why it's price is still high and its outdated.IT'S GOOD. REALLY GOOD,"
1,LIFELESS,"Okay, Owen Parry certainly knows his Civil War history. And even though I enjoyed his first novel, ""Faded Coat of Blue,"" I could not get interested in this novel, so unfortunately, I abandoned it mid-way through. Why? In spite of the marvelous character of Abel Jones, there was no suspense in the first half, nothing to really reach out and grab me, make me want to find out anything, because up to this point, the mystery has been so secondary. Page after page of musings and elaborately drawn scenarios, but no real focusing on plot. Characters and situations are introduced and then left unattended. I'm sure somewhere in the book, we find out a little more about the victims, but sorry guys I couldn't keep from snoring on this one!"
5,A Wonderful Book,"Owen Parry has done it again--given us a spectacular view into a world no longer with us. He has managed to capture the remote beauty of winter in New York's Finger Lakes region in this lush--there really is no better word to describe his beautiful use of language--sequel to ""Faded Coat of Blue."" The story, another murder mystery set during the early days of the Civil War, is a page-turner, yet the reader is torn between wanting to hurry along to find out what happens next, and wanting to linger with the marvelous characters and arresting images that seem to exist on every page. If you love language and have an interest in history, this book is for you. And if you just enjoy a good yarn, it's also a sure bet."
3,Second-Book Doldrums?,"I picked up this sequel to A Faded Coat of Blue with enthusiasm. However, I was disappointed by the time I finished the book. The sequel paled in comparison to Parry's debut. The plot was thin to the point of there not being any and because of that lack, the book seemed to drag. However, the characters were well drawn and many returned from A Faded Coat of Blue. And Parry's descriptions of the uncertain times remain unparalleled. I hope this is merely a case of second-book doldrums and that Parry will return to form in the third installment of what promises to be a fine series."
3,Doesn't play well with others in the 2.4GHz band,"I bought this to transmit PBS Kids channel from my 2nd satellite receiver in the basement to my toddle's room on the 2nd floor. Great reception if I turned off my 2.4GHz wireless network router and did not talk on my 2.4GHz cordless phone. With the router on, I got a strobing horizontal line down the screen. With the cordless phone, pressing the Talk button to use the phone killed the signal. I returned the product to the store.If you don't have other 2.4GHz devices it seems like it will work well for you."
3,Nice picture if you have no other 2.4GHz products,"This product works great -- if you have no other products on the 2.4GHz spectrum. Unfortunately my 802.11b network and Vtech 2.4GHz phones were too much for it, and the sound was punctuated with sharp snapping sounds and the picture showed strobing horizontal lines. When I unplugged my 802.11b access point and 2.4GHz phone, the sound and picture were great. Buy it if you don't have other 2.4GHz devices to interfere, but otherwise avoid it."
2,Incompatible with Cordless Phones,"Unfortunately, this product is incompatible with other products sharing the 2.4 Ghz spectrum.If you have a newer generation of cordless phone (2.4 Ghz) or a Wireless (802.11b) router/gateway, you'll get a lot of interference / lines with your picture.The other ""downer"" is that the product won't transmit back a signal from your remote control - meaning if you want to change channels at the receiving tv, you have to get up & leave the room.Oddities - There are also vestigial appendages on the device that aren't used - a small antenna on the side, an ABCD switch on the bottom (the manual refers to a channel 3/4 switch -which the A and the B settings are for, but the C and D settings don't do anything), and an IR port designated in the instruction manual as ""for future use""."
3,"Not great, but worth to keep.","Very easy to install. My transmitter is on the second floor hooked up to my VCR and the receiver is on the first floor, immediately below the transmitter. The picture is clear and without noise, unless the microwave (or the neighbor's) is turned on. No interference from my 2.4GHz wireless network, fortunately. Aside from the interference at lunch and dinner time, the system does a great job."
4,This Band Rocks!!!,"I went and saw this band play with Staind and Limp Bizkit in Pontiac, MI. They rocked, they had the whole crowd in a constant frenzy. Buy this album!"
5,THIS CD WILL NOT LEAVE YOU PLAYER!!!,This new CD from SImon Says is by far my favorite CD. I've listened to it constantly since the day i bought it! The songs are about being yourself and moving ahead in life. The future for this band is looking great! They are tremendously talented and I guarantee you will NOT regret buying this CD
5,They are the best band out of Citrus Heights!,"This band has really got it going for them. Even though everyone says they are the best band from Sac. they are still my all time favorite band from Citrus heights, (there hometown) Good luck in the future boys!!"
1,This Band Looks Like N'sync,"This band is very bad. I heard the cd, and i was like what do these guys think there doing? All the songs sound like there's there's no point to them. I have to admit this band looks like nsync. Before i heard this band i looked at the cd in a store, and i thought this band was a boy group. Maybe if they change like nsync, or the backstreet boys they would do alot better in music."
5,The perfect mix of hard music with melody,"If you love hard-core music but are sick of all the screaming then Simon Says is for you. This Sacramento Ca. based band really kicks ass. Beautifully produced by Rob Cavallo of Green Day and Goo Goo Dolls fame and mixed expertly by co-producer Mark Needham who also mixed and produced Cake's last album. This album really expands the Genre of emocore. It's a perfect mix between hard driving guitars, beautiful melodies, and studio production. if you like Deftones then this album is for you"
2,middle of the road,i must not be listening to the same record as some other reviewers. i see four and five stars but the record i listen to is not that good. it is good heavy rock with good melody but held down by weak production. there are many styles such as emo and metal being the obvious choices but there is a little punk and some other stuff. i like the voice which is beautiful and intense but the music is weak. there are some songs that just rock but for the most part this cd is weak. their second album holds better production and the song writing is more consistant with less weaker material than this album but this band is far from the saviors of rock or the great band that other reviewers see fit to call them but that is just my take.
2,not as great as i thought it would be!,"i bought this album after listening to ""lifejacket"" which i liked and still like alot but the rest of the album was not as good as i thought it would be. don't let the cover deceive you, they are NOT the backstreet boys or anything close. (not that i would like them to be!) the album is just TOO repetitive. all the songs are very similar and much harder than ""lifejacket"". the lead singer sounds like he is always singing the same song. buy this album if you don't mind the songs sounding basically the same."
5,Fit perfect in my Explorer,"2002 Explorer XLT. I'm sure it fits in other vehicles as well, but it was identical to the original coming out of my car. Dropped right in and lined up with all the right bolts and made for a very easy installation.Very happy with this purchase, as it was $60 less than any local auto parts store.Amazon Prime 2-Day delivery arrived overnight."
5,Ab Fab Must Have !!!,"Trying to add accolades deserved enough would be impossible. Let it be enough to say that this complete collection is perfect...and the only thing that could possibly get you through until the new Ab Fab episodes are released.For those challenged by the language barrier, or who just can't get enough of Pats and Eddy, the DVD is perfect for those endless repeats of scenes and lines."
5,A Gorgeous Little Thing,"What an amazing collection of metal and technology this set is! ""AB FAB"" is the most wonderful show that has ever graced television. This set is ""complete""(minus ""The Last Shout"")guide to the world of Patsy and Edina. The bonus disc contains the great ""Ab Fab Moments"" and ""How To Be Absolutely Fabulous"" and some other little trinkets. Also not to be missed are the outakes that are on each disc. They are hysterical! Like a previous reviewer, I too and dissappointed at the edited episode ""Death"". The ""Like A Prayer"" joke was funny as heck, and should have been left intacted(but hey-that's business). If you are a hardcore Ab Fab fan than grab this must have item, the episode are timeless. Enjoy!"
4,"""The Last Shout""??","This is a must have to any collection. If you have not heard of the series, you have been living under a rock. It is amazing. I have one complaint what happened to ""The last Shout"", that was the last episode, and it did not make it to the DVD set. That is the only reason that I did not give it 5 stars."
2,only one season,It should be noted that this is not the COMPLETE DVD COLLECTION. It should be titled complete dvd collection of series 1-3. Seller needs better descriptions.
5,Well worth the money,I bought this set a couple of weeks ago and just finished getting through it. It is well worth the money. You won't be sorry you bought it. Funny as it gets.
4,Absolutely outrageous,"The two principal characters are completely degenerate, much to Eddy's daughter's (Saffy) disgust. The utter shallowness of the characters and their complete lack of maturity would certainly be depressingly lame material in the hands of mediocre actresses but not here. Hysterical!"
5,Every AB FAB Fan's Dream Come True.,"Absolutely Fabulous has had Many Imitators, (""Cybil"" being the Worst, ""Sex in the City"" being the Best) but it will Never be Beaten, and Neither will this DVD, which features EVERY Episode... Count em, 18... Every Single Episode. Overload, Pleasure Overload.I have seen All of these episode Countless times, and yet they Still manage to Amuse me in Different ways every time, it is So cleverly written that it Requires multiple viewing just to get every joke, I am still just getting some of them.My 3 Absolute Favourites would have to be ""Poor"", (Eddie's Ex Husband has cut her off and she has to learn to Cut Down on Expenditures) ""Sex"" (Eddie and Patsy organise an Orgy) and ""Death"" (Eddie's Father dies and she is having a Hard time Caring). They are so Perfectly performed and Wonderfully written, they really show you why the show has such a Following."
4,Adam's Ice Skating Series worth checking out,"If you like cozies then this series is for you. The mystery isn't very challenging but the characters are fun. Bex is a great amatuer sleuth, a 24/7 researcher who tries to uncover a ten-year old scandal of a past champion skating couple that results in a brutal murder. No hint of a romance as yet but I didn't miss it. Recommend. Looking forward to DEATH DROP."
5,Brilliant...couldn't put it down!,"Elena Ives has taken writing to a new level. She has invited us to join her in experiencing the joys, pain, love, fear, and longing she expresses in her writing. From the first word until the last I was completely enthralled in each of the characters constant stuggle of moral character. Elena has attempted to show us a picture of ones true heart and inner battles...she has succeeded beyond measure.This story is one based on fictional characters but has managed to reveal the truth of ones soul. Through her heart felt words Elena has brought me to a deeper love of my Savior, Jesus Christ... Thank you.BRILLIANT!!!"
3,"You Don't Need This, But It's Cute","Someone gave me these critters when my son was born. They hang from the handle of an infant car seat/carrier. They attach with velcro. They're very cute and colorful, and they certainly jazz up his seat.My son is four and a half months old, and he is only now able to get any enjoyment out of these. Prior to this, they hung too far away for him to reach. He might have fleetingly looked at them hanging there, but that's it.The fact of the matter is, you really don't need car seat toys. If your kid is prone to getting bored sitting in his or her seat, get a soft toy or a rattle that they can manipulate. They'll get more enjoyment out of it and you can switch it when they get tired of it."
3,Very Versitile,"I received these as a gift. What I like the most of them is how versitile they are, unlike many of the other toys, these can attach almost anywhere. They were perfect to attach to our car seat / baby carrier handle for baby to look at in the car or in the stroller. The quality is not that great and my daughter really wasn't interested in them after 5 months or so, so the rattle and squeak element was really not that worthwhile."
5,Love these bugs!!,My son was handed-down these bugs from his cousin. Very durable! They both loved them. He's 8 months old and they are still hanging on his carseat. He plays with them each time we get in the car!!
4,Lady Bug is great,"My 6 month old has loved the lady bug since the beginning. However, the other two take more effort to get her attention. Now that she has teethed on them for a couple of months, the crackly feel and sound in the wings is going away."
5,What a great toy!,"This was the very first toy I purchased for my baby and I had no idea how much my baby would like it. The toys are easy to use and adaptable to many positions - I even use them on my swing for extra interest and she loves to stare at them and talk to them. I highly recommend them. In fact, I have since purchased several Sassy toys and they have all been hits with my baby."
2,Expected more...,"After reading all the reviews, I registered for the Bugs on Board. But my son just seems bored w/ the bugs. He's had them since he was a month old, and now at 3 months, he acts like he doesn't even see them on his carseat. I thought he would be more interested in them like the babies in the reviews, but I guess these just didn't do anything for him."
2,Cheaply made but cute,On of the bugs already broke and though they are colorful they are cheaply made. Wouldn't buy them again.
1,Choking Hazard,My 5 1/2 month old just started noticing and playing with the ladybug from the group about 1 week ago. Today the ladybug's head came off in his hand. Luckily I was right there to grab it out of his mouth. If that wasn't bad enough - the pouch the squeaker is enclosed in (a very flimsy mesh) ripped open and came out pretty easily with a very gentle tug. Please make sure to check the toys yourself before giving them to baby.
5,We love it!,"Bought these for my 2 month old son after seeing such good reviews. He thought they were okay and would look at them when he was in his carseat. Now at 5 months he LOVES them. I strap one to his stroller and he plays happily with it. Sometimes he even treats them like a lovey and will just hold on to one of them. They are small, easy to transport, and not noisy or obnoxious. They were a lifesaver on a long plane trip!"
5,$9 for these? What a steal!,"Knowing how much my daughter loves these Bugs On Board, I'd pay 30 dollars for them! They are fabulous!Put them on your registry or pick them up the next time you are at Babies R Us because your baby will love them!!!"
4,A great distraction!,"My five month old daughter loves her ""bugs"" that we've attached to her car seat. Now that she is beginning to teethe, she jams them into her mouth any chance she gets. The other toys she has may fall out of the car seat, but with these bugs attached to the handle, they aren't going anywhere. Keeps her pretty entertained for our jaunts around town. The only thing that kind of creeps me out is that one of the bugs looks like a giant tick. But maybe that's just me..."
2,No wonder kids don't like bugs . . .,"I registered for these ""bugs"" online, so I didn't actually see them until I opened them at my shower. They are scary looking! Naturally, they went back to the store!"
5,We've Always got Our Bugs on Board!!,"We have had these on my 5 month old son's carseat since we brought him home from the hospital. After about a month he noticed they were there and began reaching for them. He loves to get in his carseat because he knows that when we pull the handle, here comes his bugs! They keep him entertained whether we are riding in the car or sitting in a restaurant. He has played with them so much that there is no elastic left in them! We take them off and attach them to his stroller. My sister-in-law loved them so much she bought them for her 4 month old son. They are worth every penny! This is a must-have!"
5,Best money I ever spent!,"My 5 month old son loves the bugs! I orginally bought them when he was 2 months old so he would have something colorful to look at while in his infant seat. Now he hits them, grabs them, chews on them and they hold up great. He never gets tired of them. The bugs get more use than any other toy we own."
5,Very cute a little different than the picture but still cute.,They are really cute. One of the little bugs rattles. I was not told that when I bought them. I found out when they were shipped. I think That They are really cute. I know my son will love them when he is born.
4,Excellent resource for web developers,"Whereas Windows developers usually have a copy of Microsoft's 'Windows Interface Guidelines for Software Design' to turn to for advice on behaviour and usage of Windows elements, such a resource has been sorely lacking for developers of applications for the internet.This book fills the gap admirably.It provides a comprehensive set of guidelines on the use of the various components of an internet application (windows, dialogs, menus, buttons and so on), with detailed descriptions of their appearance and behaviour.As with any set of guidelines, there are individual elements and recommendations with which one could disagree.This is an eminently practical and useful book, and I believe it should be on the bookshelf of every developer of internet applications - whether using Java or another tool."
4,Basic explanation,Book arrived on time and in good condition. It gives a basic overview of the subject. It does not go into a lot of detail though so it is only good for a high level perspective.
4,Filling a vacuum of Java UI design space.,"Personally, I think the book is well structured, comprehensive for a technical audience. It gives a lot of examples and detailed guidelines how Java GUIs should look like. As well, there are a lot of hints what to do when designing screens such as dialog boxes which is not totally covered in other GUI styleguides. There are some minor ""inconsistencies"" concerning which interface widgets should be used e.g. slider control. Another point that should be changed is the use of the default button for ""destructive"" actions. A further point which should be elaborated is the difference between application and object-oriented user interface design, which is only partially covered. All in all, the guide is worth buying. Due to this minor ""inconsistencies"" I give four stars."
2,Sorry I did not like this book,"I was expecting code examples for programming GUI. That is my mistake. If you are searching for a book with lots of code examples coding in Java, this is not the book. This book was more about what seemed to be architecture of GUI which changes very rapidly. Not what I was expecting."
3,"Not bad, but not the best","Llyod Kaufman stated in his book that this was one of his most extreme movies. Not hardly, I say. The ideas in this movie are interesting, but not extreme. The last five minutes could've saved the movie if the rest wasn't so slow. Sure, some kids get shot, beaten up, and the town goes on a kiddie killing spree, but throughout an hour and a half this happens: father gets stuck in bear trap, dies, sends kid off for help, then slowly towns people get killed--some gore scenes better than others, then sheriff and science fiction writer (main characters) find out what is really going on with the children and the town rebels.For ten bucks, this was a good buy, but for the easily dissapointed don't purchase. True troma fans, make sure you're willing to be either impressed or dissapointed. There is no middle ground for these kinds of movies. This would make a wonderful rentail if you could find it. Blockbuster need not apply."
3,One of the better quality Troma films (that's not saying much),Good movie if you like a lot of gratuitous violence including seeing kids get shot in the head. It was OK.
3,A terrible tastelest movie...,...and thats what made it great! This was the film to first introduce me to Troma. There's lots of blood and gorre and bad acting...a true classic for the Troma lover.
4,Low budget + bad acting= one great troma movie.,"To start off, I'm actually 15 years old. So dont think i'm some stupid kid. This is a pretty good movie, to be from troma. Although the ending isnt all its hyped up to be."
4,"Good book, coverage of materials","I have been studying for this exam for over a month now using various sources, but this book brought everything together in a clear and concise manner. Unfortunately, some of the chapters are a bit lengthy and could have been seperated for easier retention, and the DVD was ""ok"". Other than that, it did a great job of preparing me for the exam."
3,"Good material, but needs a good Editor","The material in this book and in the 70-292 Study Guide is very good and complete. However, the number typos, punctuation errors, references to missing or incorrect figures, and just plain wrong answers to some practice questions -- is all very distracting. It would appear that the final edit of this book was skipped in order to get it out on schedule. Unfortunate. Make sure you have plenty of hands-on experience before taking this exam, esp. if this is your only source of study material."
4,Wow...,"Wonderfully complex reading, the kind of thing if you grasp the concepts will make you smile at the brilliance of the science. Unfortunately, I'm not there yet and still struggle to understand it all.More for the scientist in you, not for practical day to day use or, knowledge."
4,Kettle,I thought it would whistle but it doesn't. I really like it still though and it also comes in different colors.
1,Handle heats up & does NOT whistle,"I do like the color--reason I bought it-- goes with my KitchenAid Mixer and utensils, etc.; BUT it does NOT whistle. Tried less water so that there was enough space for the air to heat up and cause whistling, but it does NOT! Get involved in my writing and forget I'd put kettle on, so this is NOT good. Also, as another reviewer states, the handle does heat up seriously, unlike the kettle I have costing $2.95 which I purchased at the local grocer and to which I return gladly. Am returning this item and saving up for a much better kettle if I want one. NOT A KETTLE FOR DAILY USE. Mostly decorative."
2,MISS COLOR,"THE QUALITY IS NOT THE BEST ON THIS TEA POT, BUT THE WORST IS THAT IT IS PURPLE NOT COBALT BLUE. TERRIBLE PURPLE! DO NOT RECOMEND!"
3,Not so helpful for me,This chewed off the bolt instead of bitting onto it.I'm hoping it will become useful one day so i kept it.It seemed like a good idea when i bought it.
2,Unenjoyable,"Uninventive and dull. Pace barely moves, characters are cardboard. Overall, bad. If it's your thing to read bad, old stories, you'll enjoy it. If not, stay away."
2,"Uva's Guide To Cranes, Dollies, and Remote Heads","This book is not really a guide, its a selection of specs and line drawings that you could get online from the manufactures"
3,Wings,Enjoyable story line. The heroine was sassy and making her own choices which I liked. Interesting story line about pilots and how much they love flying.
3,Ok book. Terrible transcription to e format,Mediocre book. Not really a surprise. But the transcription to kindle format is riddled with errors from poorly supervised optical character recognition scanning.Would like my money back
3,I Just Don't Get It!,"I really enjoyed the last 6 chapters. Until then, the book was slow, boring, repetitive, and dull. I never could see what others were giving such high reviews about."
4,A new Canadian Star!,"When I heard Judith Berard's song ""Ou que J'aille"" I was really impressed by her vocal performance and the melody of it. So, I decided to to buy her album ""Ailleurs"" and I should admit that it was one of my best album purchasing decisions. Most of the songs are worth to listen over and over! If you are looking for an upbeat album do not waste your time to try this album; but, if you are looking for ballads, romance, good music and a singer with voice, also promising a brillant future, purchase ""Ailleurs"". My favorite tracks in the album are; ""Ou que j'aille"", ""Vivre"", ""I miss u so"", ""Sans toi"" and ""Si J'etais"". I think she will be one of the most popular singers, especially in the French scene; discover her music before others!"
5,Spectacular French Pop,"This is one of the best albums I have ever heard. Judith Berard's voice is wonderful, and the music moves from gentle ballads to driving pop songs. It's all in French (even I Miss U So has only those words in English) but the music and voice make it a must even for English lovers of pop music."
2,Theres nothing amazing about this game,"The graphics are nothing, there are much better baseball games with much better graphics than this title. The only thing I thought was cool and challenging about this game was scenario mode. Other than that everything about this is terrible, the batter control, pitching, anything you can think of. Has Konami ever made a good sports game? No I bet not, they better stick with action games or their reputation might be as good as dead, this was made a while ago but it is still pretty bad, if you are still playing N64 I suggest you get one of the All-Star Baseball games, they are pretty good, or should I say they were good for their time."
1,complex and confusing,"I have found this book really hard going. It goes through different theoretical models of learning and doesn't actually get into any kind of training until well into the book. It is difficult to follow and by the time my son and I started to get through the dense material our puppy was no longer a puppy. This book does not provide any kind of straight forward approach, rather it gives all the different approaches. It may be OK as an advanced book concerning different models of dog psychology, but it isn't a typical ""for dummies"" book. It isn't helpful on getting some basic training happening. I wish I hadn't bought it as it wasted mine and my children's time."
5,Great Buy,"Book was shipped fast and good as new. I haven't read it yet, but hopefully when i do, it will help me train my newly adopted 5 year old (puppy)!"
4,Review from another veterinary technician,"Like another reviewer, I am also a veterinary technician and I strongly disagree with her dismissal of many things in this book on the basis that the authors aren't ""medically trained"". These authors are very experienced and respected people in the dog training/health fields. Their advice on rabies vaccination timing and commercial dog foods are, I believe, valid. The veterinary field (vets and technicians)is not a monolithic block. I personally know many licensed veterinarianswho agree wholehearedly with the health issues in this book. As someone who has a degree in veterinary technology (plus human physical therapy) I am dismayed by the attitude of many of my colleagues that vettech/vet school is the only place to receive valid training and information. There is minimal training inbehavior and nutrition.I have found that the Volhard's training methods work quite well, and they are also followed and respected by many canine breeding/training professionals."
4,Great as a starting point in training your pet.,This was the first book I bought on dog training. Its great because it covers a broad range of topics and is very easy to read. I got noticable results with my dog from their training techniques.Its a good introduction and starting point from which to then go on to more specialized books.
3,Too much technique reading...Figured it would be a fun book,I brought this because all the other Dummies book are really full of important information.....This one is to technical at least for me.
4,Very helpful,"I purchased the kindle edition, which in itself is awesome to use, since it's always right where I am! The book is easy to understand, gives step by step instruction, and it works! I have had dogs for over 40 years, and have always been able to teach them the basic commands, sit, lay down, and stay, but with this book, I have taken the training further. The pups are happy to know it's "" training"" time, they respond and I have seen great progress, whether I'm teaching them commands or tricks! I don't know if it would win us any gold medals, but I wasn't going for the gold, I just wanted my dogs to come when called, stay when asked, and to have some fun! This book helped us achieve just that!"
4,A joyful history read,"While browsing a thrift shop I took home a copy of this short history of the early settling of Plymouth and its environs. It was a pure delight to read, very informative,not a pedants publication but something that even a high school student would find interesting. Very historical and at the same time highly readable.I would encourage anyone who is the least bit interested in the period of early 1600 to enjoy it. I can't say enough about the enjoyment I experienced whilst reading it."
5,Facinating history of cryptography,"I enjoyed this book. This book will give you a good general history of cryptography in the US. (It does not focus on the US solely, just most of the story takes place in the US.) Steven Levy describes, succinctly and in layman's terms what cryptography is, where we started and how we got to where we are today. This is not a book of equations and diagrams. Seek out other manuals for those details. While the subject of crytpography may sound like a cure for insomnia, Mr Levy's book is practically a page turner."
5,Comprehensive as well as gripping,"I really liked the book. It covers the history of modern cryptography, both the technical and policy aspects in sufficient detail, while maintaining brisk pace."
5,I suck at math.,"But Levy had me hooked by the first chapter. I could not help but care about the characters he portrayed and their plight against the American government. A hectic pace drags you through the book, knowing that their discovery has to be in time to save all of our privacy. If you can't find yourself caring about that then this is not the book for you.The highest course I've ever taken is pre-calc and I never use higher math in my daily life. So, I have to attribute my fanaticism to this book on Levy's writing and the power of the story itself. Also, the ideas are so well articulated that even a moron like me can pick up on most of the theory (albeit in a simplistic form).I would recommend this to any one who has ever fought the establishment or anyone that has ever wanted to."
4,Engaging and Readable,"Levy does a good job of making a complex and potentially dry subject readable for a wide audience. Using an approach similar to the approach he took in _Hackers_, he uses the the personal history of the participants as a lens to study the history of a technology development._Crypto_ outlines the history of cryptography as it lurched towards public availability. Levy provides an overview of both technical and political obstacles that occurred along the way. Examines issues of control, personal freedom, and national security."
4,Almost all the Disney stories in 1 book,"This is a good book for a 2-3 year old, but after that, the small reader realises that the stories have been abridged to the point of not making any sense unless you know the original version. I am happy we bought it, though, and we get a lot of joy out of it."
4,Dayton reviewer,"Excellent book, it has all the stories from Cinderella to the Road to Eldadoro (and a few more with Mickey and Winnie the Pooh). My daughter loves the book (the pictures are wonderful and colorful)."
2,Terrible condition.,"This book's condition was terrible. I realize that even though I bought this book used, it should not have been in terrible shape. There is marks all over the pages as well as page tears. This Is Ridiculous."
5,Disney Story Book,"The best review I can offer is that this compilation of Disney Favorites reduced to print and art work can captivate my 3 year old grandson - and trust me, not much else that exists on the planet can make that claim. We start by looking at the front cover and he points to one of the pictures and tells me he wants to read ""this one"". (By the way - there is a problem since dumbo is on the front cover but the story isn't inside - so steer clear of dumbo). Once he makes his selsction we dig into the book and he finds the story by finding the right picture and off we go. There was one occassion when we repeated this process at least 6 times. We read this book for at least an hour. believe me when i tell you that this 3 year old spends a lot of time either riding his training wheeled bike up and down the sidewalk or bouncing off the walls. I love this book - and you and your three year olds will love it too."
2,Those teeth!,"Whatever inspired Martin Amis to drivel on about his teeth? Did he think we would be interested? Does he want to know about my uncle's gall bladder operation?Really this book was a sad, sad disappointment. Maybe I was taken in by all the hype. Maybe Amis's new agent has done a good job of promoting a mediocre piece of writing. The only thing in its favor is that Amis's penmanship remains as sharp as ever. The subject matter is more than questionable."
4,Some fascinating revelations,"I'm still wading through the book and enjoying it mightily. It does sometimes veer too close to pastiche, and sometimes the insights he comes close to he can't seem to bear to examine for more than a minute. What I'm impressed and moved by is his confession of his own lack of innocence as a child. The molestation episode - which takes place in America in the 50s and is incredibly Nabokovian(!) - has stayed with me and haunted me. In so many ways he was a neglected child, brought up by a wilful, childish father with no sexual boundaries. The very fact that so many pictures were taken of him smoking as a kid is mind-boggling. Anyway, somewhere in there is a man who has learned to care about other people."
4,Self-portrait?,"This is a great read but it jars as a self-portrait. There are no nasty bits of self-examination to give the nice bits credibility. We hear little of his broken first marriage or his relationships with his brother and sister. He reveals that he tried to patch up his friendship with Julian Barnes without revealing the details of their break-up. But we do hear a lot about his feelings. The Amis portrayed is compassionate, loyal, put-upon, witty - and a bit of a caricature.But it doesn't matter (that much). It is worth reading for the observations about life - grief, love, divorce, age - and the extraordinary structure. I also just love the way he writes. It's also a great insight into how authors work and think. And of course the best portrait to emerge is of his father Kingsley. It is warts-and-all mixed with biting anecdotes and judgements. Whereas Martin emerges with barely a pimple."
2,"What's it all about, Martin?","I greatly admire Martin Amis's skillful pen. I wish I could write half as well. But the subject matter of 'Experience' (Amis, himself) makes me think I lead a more interesting life. If I was setting out to write my memoires, I think I'd leave my teeth out of it (even though they've given me some trouble). Or maybe a paragraph, maximum. If I wanted people to know about the things that struck me emotionally, I would almost certainly include girlfriends/lovers - not dead relatives whom I hardly knew.Most of the interesting parts of 'Experience' are the quotes from Martin's father, Kingsley. So who wants to read second-hand quotes? This book is full of explanatory footnotes that could easily have been included in the main body of text, and would probably have been more interesting for being so.It was a struggle to finish."
5,Excellent,"I've had this CD in my collection for years and it is one of my favorites. I have never heard a better Scriabin. Steuerman's tonality is one of the most impressive I've ever heard, notes and chords are some of the richest and clearest imaginable, all the while seeming effortlessly performed. He also manages to create a great deal of emotion with his playing. I don't hear much about this pianist, although often when he is mentioned, it is very favourably. If you find this CD used buy it, if for Sonata number 3 alone (the adagio section is astonishing).A remarkable recording."
5,Freaky!,When you can drive around crushing cars with a car that you see a body trapped in plastic twitching around in the backseat with you just dont say no. This game is freaky(Kids should not get their hands on this game)and cool. Its techincally and playability is perfect so I recommend this games to all which are old enough and dont get shocked easily.
2,What's the point?,"The idea behind the game was pretty cool, car combat done with superb graphics etc.. But what I found in this game was a sense of gloom every time I loaded it up. You may think I sound crazy but if you're a parent, you may seriously want to consider passing on this game, there's not one ounce of positivity or kid friendly gameplay in it. I can't understand why they'd put such a depressing backstory in this game, maybe if they'd ended on an upnote with at least one character... but every character gets tricked, and then ultimately killed off in the end. It just really bothered me and therefore I can't recommend this game, not even to adults."
1,disappointing,"Well, I went to the local used video game store and picked up a copy of this for $15. I havent played the others in the Twisted Metal series, and probably because of that this game really disappointed me. Graphics are fine, but the gameplay was just chaotic. You start in this huge arena and all the AI cars just zoom around you and blow the crap out of you. The controls seemed a little awkward for when I tried things like circling around another car and shooting it, or just trying to shoot and evade in general. I put about an hour's time into it, but in the end I really didn't have any fun at all.If you haven't played and liked the other twisted metal games, stay far away from this one."
2,Do Not Spend Your Money On This!!!!!!,"out of any of the games I own this game is my least favorite. I can't even believe I had bought it. I strongly suggest if you want to play it, RENT IT"
2,over-rated,"Why does everyone like this game so much? It gets boring fast.. you need codes just to keep it interesting. I will say that the graphics are great and the vehicles and environments themselves are pretty cool.. but the gameplay isn't stellar and the storylines for the characters are ultra stupid. The game just needlessly erodes our ever evaporating shock factors and capitalizes on cheesy characterization. It's just a video game, yeah.. but you'd think with the time and money that went into making it they'd think a little harder. It is fun with multiple people though. It's your money..."
3,A fun game for a while,I first played this game at my friends house just after it came out. I had been a big fan of the 1st 2 games and was highly anticipating this games release. I was amazed at how fun it was and how good the graphics were. So the next day i went and bought it. I quickly beat the game with every charecter and after that there really isnt anything to do and it has virtually no replay value. Using codes is really the only way to enjoy this game (unless u have minion) because it is unreasonably hard. I would srongly recommend renting it instead of a purchase.
3,Good at First. . . But in the end a disappointment,"When I first got this game and started it, I thought it was great and the guns you use are amazing. Everybody has a sweat special and some (Like Sweet Tooth) have awesome specials. I liked finding secrets in all the levels (like blowing up a building to find a tunnel). But after a while, the game gets old and repetitive. At first, it is incredibly hard and you will probably die right away. And the problem is, as soon as you get the hang of it, the weapons and specials get old and you've found out everything on the levels. Sure you can unlock new characters- but then they get old real fast. And it isn't even great in the beginning because you're constantly getting killed because it is so hard. Plus, it's impossible to see when you are in two player mode and trying to look for speeding cars about to hit you."
2,HUUUUUUGGGGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!,"This game has great graphics and a great storyline. However, this is NO different than TM3 + TM4. I am a big fan of TM2 I cant imagine the hours after hours wasted away playing it. I was extremely excited to hear about another TM that was supposed to be as good as TM2. The gameplay of TM Black is the same as 3 + 4. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
3,"it's okay, when it works.","it seems like a pretty good port of the older twisted metal games. I don't have any real problems with this game, it doesn't suck but it doesn't compare to the older ones either. to me, when it comes to games, there are good ones and ones that suck. this is a good one and I recommend it to anyone who has played the previous twisted metal games.I got a bad copy of this game though, but I'm not going to take any stars off because of it. the disc is heavily scratched and freezes very often, if it even decides it wants to load and the music skips a lot. but whatevs."
4,Great but kind of unenjoyable,This game is super mega crazy HARD. You basically have to start on easy mode since normal mode is intense since EVERY car you fight with all attack you instead of a free for all frenzy like I was expecting. However this game is definetly more enjoyable with friends. The story is not bad but the campaign can get challenging. If that is not a problem then you will have a lot of fun with this.
5,Oh... ...MAN! This game rocks! Excellent first buy!,"I got my PS2 in last night and had ordered TMB with it as my first game. I am primarily a PC Gamer and it's been a long time since I've used a PSX-type controller. This said, I wanted a game that would ""ease"" me into re-learning the controller, one that I was already familiar with. I was pleasantly suprised and excited when I fired up the PS2 for the first time and TMB started. Awsome use of the PS2 graphics capabilities!!!! Great gameplay/story. I look forward to losing lots of sleep over this game! Bottom line: Killer graphics/gameplay/SOUND!, very easy to learn"
5,Flawless.,"This game is awesome, from graphics (which usually doesn't matter to me) to character design. A distinct improvement over 3& 4(like you won't notice!), but I still think 2 is the best (don't ask why) though. Gameplay has less blood than the others, and it doesn't show that much gore in the FMVs (with the grusome scenes, it makes you imagine the gore! TThink of punching someone in the face with a boxing glove... with medical knives taped to it.) Yes, very dark and disturbing, but unlike the other Twisted Metals (including 2), the characters, actually ARE charcters! If you don't get what I mean is that there is plot and character development. But nonetheless, rent it first to see if you enjoy it (and can handle it!)"
5,Best TM Ever,This Twisted Metal is the one that brings it to the Love You wanna feel. Recommended to anyone! Service was great too!
4,Not what I expected,"I was totally unfamiliar with the series when I picked up this game. I was expecting an Interstate76 style game with a worth while story mode and great multiplayer. The multiplayer in Twisted metal is great but I wasnt thrilled with the story mode. You fight in a tournement instead of driving full out missions, which put a huge damper on my liking.The games graphics are great and just driving around and running things over is enjoyable. The cons definetely dont matter that much when you see how much the game is. A cheap but well worth while buy."
5,Twisted Metal: Black,"This was one of my first games for the PS2. I loved it. I then put it aside for a couple of months for GTA3 and SSX tricky, which were also awsome game. A couple weeks back, I played this game again. Once again, I got hooked. I finally unlocked a character (Warthog). The graphics are still stunning and the framerate is topnotch. The only thing I have left to say, is WOW!"
2,A terrible disaappointment...,The game is very overrated. If you bought the other Twisted Metals don't buy this one. It has a very poor plot. The plot is about a bunch of maniac losers trying to blow each others cars up. The controls are difficult and rather confusing. The graphics are below average for a PS2 game. I was very disappointed in this game.
3,Doesnt It Get Old?,"Ok, when Twisted Metal Black came out, I thought to myself,""Its worth renting, but definately not buying.""The fact is, even though this game is fun and all, after a while it really does get old. The story is way to short, it only took me 1 night to beat it and as soon as i unlocked all the characters, IT WAS BORING!!So, to me i guess, it would be a complete waste of 50 bucks"
2,foolish,"Twisted Metal: Black may not be easy, not much in the way for cheats as compared to Twisted Metal 4 (including access to the bosses)"
5,"Twisted Metal is back, and better than ever!","It's great to see that the Twisted Metal franchise is back on top of the car-battle genre. Things got shook up when 989 Studios took control, but since the original creators are back in business, it has made up for the failure that 989 Studios created. Twisted Metal Black is not anything like the originals, so don't expect the same friendly fun that once was. Twisted Metal Black is exactly what the title says. The backgrounds are dark and mysterious, and each character's story is unique and darker. So, this is a warning to those below the age of 17, Twisted Metal Black may not be in your league. It once was, but not anymore. There is lots of blood, disturbing cut scenes, and more violence than you could ever think of. Twisted Metal has taken a turn to the darkside, which has turned out to be a turn for the best."
1,Not that fun and too violent.,"I am a fan of the Twisted Metal series, but this game is the worst. There is too much going on in each level and because of this and the fact that the cars are very difficult to control, it makes it very difficult to find your way around. The level of gross violence in this game also disturbs me. I would advise all parents to use extreme caution before buying this game for your children (but preferably don't buy it at all). For example, one of the car's special weapons is a live person who is chained up in the back of the car and is lauched onto enemy cars and then explodes. Many of the storylines of the characters are also very scary and violent."
4,Very Explicit,"This game was great. The story's of all the characters are so breathtaking. the graphics are amazing. But, parents be warned! THIS GAME IS VERY EXPLICIT. There are scenes of cannibalism, extreme violence and blood and explicit murder, foul language, disturbing pictures, witchcraft, guns, and disfigurement. Not to mention the disattachment of limbs and organs. All the characters in this game are a bunch of murderers, thieves, cannibals, psychopaths, and freaks. Don't buy this game for your kid, unless your child can go to sleep at night with those images in his/her head. But i love it. 5 stars all the way baby!"
4,Pretty good,"The best one yet of the series. Impressive graphics and gameplay. But, suppossedly they're coming out with an online version soon, so you might want to save your money for that."
4,Lives Up To Its Title,"This game earns its rating. With most of the characters, they have a story which you unlock as you progress further into the game. And they are dark stories. Most of the endings are ""happy"" in the sense that the character gets what he wants--but what they want is often a very dark revenge. There was one character whose story I found uncomfortable on a personal level, and I didn't take him. The characters who want to do some good end up dead. Are the makers trying to something here? In any case, this game is NOT for youngsters.As for the game itself, it is good. The controls can be modified to suit your taste, and the control is smooth. The graphics don't take full advantage of the PS2, but when you consider everything it has to do, you let it slide. All in all, a good game--if you can stomach it."
1,Don't give in to the hype....look elsewhere,"this game [is bad], i've played all the other twisted metal games and this one [is bad]. the action is way to fast and its almost impossilbe to destroy the other cars. get twisted metal 1 its a classic and the best out of the series. dont waste your $$$ like i did."
2,Not the greatest game in the world........,"Okay, this game is pretty good. I mean, when I first bought it, i was so excited, but when i got home and played, man it was fun. Then, 2 hours later, the game was boring. It was the same thing almost. Just hunting down cars. Also, the bosses were extremely hard. I meant they had shields and you had to shoot until the shield was gone and then kill the boss. So, if your thinking of buying this game, forget it(In my opinion. I don't care if you waste your money!)!!"
3,Do NOT buy for single-player,"I'll say it right now, if you don't have a full multiplayer game going, this game will not be fun. The single player story missions are fine, but they're only for the story. Four player mayhem unloading arsenals upon each other is the fun stuff. The single player is just frustrating, all the other cars aim for you and the AI is unfair. They have an infinite number of their special weapons, meaning the second they cross you, it's gonna be hard to see where you're going in a second. The graphics are very good and the physics engine is fantastic, the environments are fun (although the collecting hidden tokens for unlockables is LAME), and the characters are diverse and all are fun to use in their own way. But again, absolutely not for single player."
5,My Hopes are High.,"Does anyone else remember the sinking feeling of playing TM3 the first time? After endless hours of fun with friends on TM2, I was sickened to see this neutered version of what should be a beautifully clunky and violent game. I have researched TM:B in great detail and being that the TM1/TM2 team is back under a new name (previously Singletrac, now Incognito) I can GUARANTEE that this is a five of five game. Epic sized levels, extreme detail in every element of the game, a new frightening premise - it all leads the creation of brilliance. I have preordered."
2,Black...same old...same old thing.,"I'm going to forego my usual in-depth reviews for this game. We all know what Twisted Metal is and this is nothing more than a rehash of those same games. Here's why:Pros:Excellent GraphicsCool Mini-moviesEndurance & Challenge levels are interestingGood to pass time withCons:Short game with small levelsRepetitious gameplayBoring endings to each characterSame old rehash of earlier TM gamesNot enough ""total-destruction"" of buildings and such for this type of game.If you want to be ""burned-out"" by a game, I recommend ""Burnout, Test Drive, and Twisted Metal: Black."" Not worth the money. A renatal at best."
5,this game kicks ...,this game is the best game there is for twisted metal. although this game might be hard without a code this game is the best of them all. from seneries that turn from day to night in a time period and the cars... the Cars! there are so many with [amazing] wepons some of which could help u win this game. every time u win the game u get a ending movie like in sweet tooths one he doesnt want the cure after all so he crushes it and kills colopyso. the came might have one or two bad words said by sweettooth and spectre but no worries its all good. buy this game please its a really great game
3,"Great game, lacking depth","The graphics have improved. The weapons have improved. Sadly, the story line is still more of the same. With these types of games now including great story modes and various types of activities, this dated dimension of gaming just isn't as appealing as it once was. Once you've admitted that to yourself, this is still a night of fun with friends. As cheap as it is now, go ahead and buy it."
5,Twisted Metal Black Good Game Or Bad Game,This was a great game and the graphics were just perfect. The controles were much easier than any other Twisted Metal [3].
2,A huge disappointment...,This game is exremely overrated. The plot was patheticley corny. The controls were diffucult and sometimes confusing. The graphics were below average for a PS2 game. If you enjoyed the other Twisted Metal games prepare to be let down hard. The multi-player is far from good. The backgrounds all seemed to be the same. Please do yourself a favor and rent this game before you buy it. Then you can see how bad it really is. :(
2,Not the Game I Remember...,"I remember playing one of the first Twisted Metals and playing it for hour and hours growing up. I just got my PS3 fixed and came across the Black addition and ordered it hoping to have some fun with it. Let me tell you, after about 5 minutes of playing this version I realized this was nothing like the original. It's very hard to play. The cars are very hard to control and it seems like the enemy is indestructible...Not happy..."
3,Twisted Metal 2 still better,"The game is too dark, and unless your in a very dark room its hard to see what is going on. I'll play it because its still good fun. TM2 is still the best version made I think, despite the crappy graphics (PS3 download available now)."
4,"Good game, but not the best","Twisted Metal: Black has good graphics and awesome vehicles and weapons. However, the story line in the game sucks. The story does not go with the other Twisted Metal games."
1,Overrated boring game,"I thought this game was very promising. I liked the dark and twisted Silent Hill 2, and the violent mayhem of GTA3, but this game turned to be a major dissapointment. I rented this game once and will never pick it up again. Best described as boring and repetitive. Mindless chaotic nonsense gameplay. Dissapointing tiny graphics (except the cut scenes, which are good). Don't believe the hype, if you are new to this series, rent it first!"
2,Silly.,Got the game because of the reviews. Big disapointment. The game is simply silly. Maybe OK if you're 13 but still. A lot of better games out there. Graphics also disapointing.
5,A HARDCORE GAMER FROM CA,"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU GUYS BITCHIN ABOUT TM IS THE BEST CAR SHOOTING GAME ON THE PLANET AND HOW IS A ""M"" RATEING GOING TO STOP SOMEONE FROM OWNING TMB. 989 ONLY MAKES GOOD GAMES LIKE SYPHION FILTER THEY SHOULD STICK TO SHOOTERS. TM 3&4 SHOULD HAVE NEVER CAME OUT BUT THEY DID ALL MOST KILLING TM ALL TOGETHER BUT NOW WITH TM:B IT SHOULD BE RESTORED TO ITS FORMER GLORY.I GIVE IT A 5 STAR BECAUSE OF THE CLEAN GRAPHICS, CLEAN PLAY AND BECAUSE TWISTED METAL:BLACK IS GOD NOW ALL THATS LEFT IS... TWISTED METAL:ONLINEBUY IT NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT I SAID BUT BUY IT BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST CAR GAME OUT THERE EVEN OUT RANKING GT3."
1,Why?,"As a 1/144 scaled model, it is impossible to expect anyone to pay almost a grand for it. Most 1/144 models, even though almost all of them are imported, rarely rise above thirty-five dollars and are more commonly bought for about twenty bucks at any local anime store or online. The larger 1/100 scale are just shy of $100 in most cases, and even the 1/66 scaled models (usually perfect grade) top out at around $300. This product's price is just insane."
1,junk,"This product was a waste of money. I had hoped that it would be similar to the models in the gundam wing series, with many points of articulation, i.e the knees, elbows, hands, and feet bend and/or move. But I was sadly mistaken, only the head, shoulder joints, and hip joints actually move and the overall quality of the materials they used in creating the model seems sub-par."
2,could have put more info,Book provides good overview about SQL and intro to other major DBMS. Disappointed with the fact that book covers so little.My suggestion is that if you planning to learn SQl just buy a SQL book for the DBMS you are planning to learn.
3,ok book. too wordy.,"Use this book for an online SQL class. This book is sufficient for learning SQL but I find reading the lengthy narration to be too time-consuming. It's probably great for beginners. If you have previous exposure to database language or programming language, the text may be too long to read.It may also be great actually for an online class because the author seems to put everything he needs to teach during classes in this book. I've done a report in MS ACCESS before so I'd like to read less."
5,The BEST of both worlds!,"This book written by the Whitman's is one of the bestI have read with a mother, daughter team. It is sooooclever how Barbara tells her side of the story, thenSusan comes in and tells her involvement. You laugh,smile,and realy get into it. This stories will touch your heart!!"
4,saucony trigon 5 ride,"I truly loved the 2 pairs of Saucony Trigon 4 Ride I had. So, when the update 5 came out, I bought a pair. I haven't had much luck running in these. They feel like they have less cushion and more stabililty. It was my understanding, from my research, that this shoe is for a nuetral runner and is not a stability shoe. I wish updates didn't have to change the shoe so much. If I can find the old 4, I will buy it. My calves aren't so happy with the 5. I'm sure it is a great shoe for others, just not for me."
2,cushion and arch placement,"This shoe was not cushioned as promised and the arch placement was not comfortable, even for a wide shoe."
2,Not a great running shoe,"I had never worn Saucony so when they were recommended, I decided to try. I ran on the store's treadmill and they felt fine, but I really should have taken the time to run longer.They boast that there is cushion, but there isn't enough cushion (or the shoe breaks down REALLY fast). My feet ached after I ran only about 20 miles in these shoes (I run about 3 miles at a time). The toe box is big and too roomy for me.My advice? Keep a journal on your activity and what your feet felt like during and after and maybe even how they feel the next day. Go to a store that knows running shoes and take your time deciding. Hoping for better luck next time."
5,Fabulous 70's Music Just As Relevant Today,"A friend recommended I listen to ""Benedictus"" by the Strawbs.I missed this CD back in the 70's as Classical was occupying my listener choices then. I heard of the Strawbs but know I am a true fan. 'Benedictus' is fabulous and made the right point for me at the right time but the whole album 'Grave New World"" is a must listen. Was David Cousins looking into the future? Now I am visiting with Sandy Denny music and loving this new journey."
4,"may you rock, in your grave.. new world","Every Strawbs album between Witchwood and Nomadness has something unique to offer. Put it all together, its the same band but the progression of band member changes and sound were so quick and impressive that for the most part no two albums are all that similar. Grave New World is the Strawbs pioneering the sound to its farthest reaches. This was a really great band and Dave Cousins is a fantastic talent who deserves more attention for passionate songs and original ideas. I only found out about his band by chance, but I feel that their music had a great joy and sincerity about it, and this album is the cornerstone at which all their ideas reached it's zenith."
4,Cree Summer's 1st Album Is Terrific,"This is not a piece of fluff, folks -- Cree has got something special going on. This is a solid CD filled with great ideas. She's the real deal, and a bona fide original. A Different World, indeed! Appreciation to Kravitz for his major contributions."
5,Please make another CD!!!!,I love this CD and still play it faithfully. I wish that she would make another one. She sounds so sincere. Thats hard to come by.
5,Magical and Mystical,"This CD is simply a must-have. When you're holding the CD for the first time, you can feel the tingle. Cree is truly a goddess, with her magical voice and mystical lyrics. From gentle vocals on 'Revelation Sunshine' to the powerful message on 'Curious White Boy', Street Farie is one of the greatest albums to ever come out. This Lenny Kravitz-produced CD is a gem and would make a great addition to any CD/tape collection. I am lucky to have discovered Cree Summer. If you haven't already, BUY THIS ALBUM and you won't regret it."
5,Wonderful,"Cree we love you! What a refreshing album, it has a very hip groove that Cree's friend Lenny Kravitz has helped out on. You can hear Lenny's influence. It takes nothing away from Cree. With her fresh approach to hip hop it is an oustanding album. Compares to a Sade Lenny K. and the Goo Goo Dolls"
3,Pretty Good Folk/Rock,This is a solid debut for Cree Summer (formally of the defunct show A Different World). Her Producer and Mentor Lenny Kravitz seemed to have had heavy control over most of the album's production which can be a necessarily good thing for Cree. It is a shame that this album didnt get the commercial success that it would of gotten if it had been Lenny's album. If you like folksy rock with a slice of r&b then this is for you. Although Cree isnt the best singer in the world that shouldnt stop you from buying this delightful music candy.
4,"LoL, Isn't this the voice-over actress...","Wow, I didn't think she could get any more annoying after adding the voices of Susie, Elmyra and some other crap that appears on Those Nicktoon shows, but she proved me wrong. Why can't she just stick to one career? Why does she have to try and prove she can sing on top of everything else..."
1,"Maybe I Need to Listen Again....""NO!!""","I'm not sure what the rest of you were listening to, but I was NOT feeling this cd. When I heard she had it out, and that Lenny Kravitz would be involved in it's creation, I hunted high and low until I found it in a used cd store. My reaction: ""What exactly is this?"". I'm not sure what the message/feel/vibe she was going for, but whatever it is, it's not one that I can appreciate. For Cree, I'll keep watching the early seasons of ""A Different World"". For music, I'll stick to Lenny."
4,Truly Great! (4.5 Stars),"I fell in love with Mean Sleep when the single was released but at the time I wasn't open minded enough to check out her album. Recently stumbled across this CD here on amazon from recommendations - wow, what a pleasant surprise! I am so glad that I made my way back to Cree, she has a beautiful voice. The more I listen, the more I love it, I didn't realize how talented she truly is.I'm listening to Mean Sleep as I type this review and I keep stopping to jam with her and Lenny! LOL.Okay here's some highlights: Deliciously Down, Mean Sleep, Fall, Soul Sister, Curious White Boy, Miss Moon and Still Heart.It's definitely poetic; the lyrics are beautiful and different...not typical by any means. It's amazing to hear music like this. I hope Cree comes out with more music.Happy listening!"
5,About time I can play a CD without skipping a song...,"First of all, I'm a Hip-Hop fan primarily, but I had seen her performance on the Leno show and I had to pick up the album. Of course the first track was the one that she performed and I was feenin' to hear it again. I went through the whole CD and all I could say was WOW. I don't even listen to this type of music, and I couldn't help but play it for my friends. And they liked it also. As a music artist/performer myself, I am open minded, and this CD just blew my mind. 2 words for ya'll -- GET IT"
5,Maintaining sanity.,waiting to get this cd drove me insaine. i can remember every time i heard revelation sunshine *it was 5 and a half* until i got the cd. *it's now too many times to count. :)* i love the way the music gets inside your head and paralyzes you until you become part of it. *i find that ani difranco does the same thing* i feel like i'm going to die if i dont' hear it enough. it's a sad addiction. :) great cd.
3,Pretty Good,This is an awsome thing but you need to buy seperate cables fo 4 player and if I wanted to play 2 player I'd use my old GB/GBC link cable.
1,Oh man you guys....my kids are so dissapointed..!,My kids are so dissapointed. You wont get the right cord.....it's not what you see in the picture...you get a cord thats white..but with no tags or insturctions or description..no where at all does it say GBA or nintendo..good luck buying from this seller...there goes 10 bucks I coulda used for gas!
1,Crap,"This thing sucks. I plugged it into the gameboy, and when i tried to pull it out, the plastic part completely separated from the metal part and pulled one of the internal wires out, so i never even got a chance to use it. Instead of buying this, just take 10 dollars and throw it in the trash. It will save you the disappointment."
3,Game Cable,"Its kinda torn up, but in ok condition.I haven't tried using it yet, but it may just work fine.I expected a higher quality, though."
4,game link cable,"I have a lot of fun with this cable, I can connect two of my game boy advances and trade or battle together. It is simple to use."
5,"great game, a classic . We love game boy",We are happy to have the cable to play two game boys at once. It is nice to find since its manufacture has been discontinued.
4,Good for Multiplaying!,This is what you need for a good quality for your linkings.You need this when you want to use the Multiplayer options and those features are great!One of the best Multiplayer games is Mario Kart Super Circuit.So why wait by playing by yourself in total silence instead of playing with 2-4 friends???
2,Too short,"The cable does work as intended, but it's too short, unless you're sitting head-to-head or side-by-side, I hope 3rd parties make a longer one..."
3,hi,"Why did nintendo make it so you had to have more than one? Oh, that's right, it's nintendo they love to force you to pay for more if they can."
1,It doesn't work,The Game Boy Advance game link cable that I received didn't work at all. It didn't even come in a box and it didn't look like the cable you're supposed to get!! It looks nothing like the cable that you see on the box. We tried it and it didn't work at all. So I paid $14.95 and money for shipping for a product that didn't work!! I won't be buying from the person that I got it from and I plan on letting people know that he sells inferior products!!
5,Works Perfectly,"The game boy advance link cable works perfectly. It's not a Nintendo product as described, but there is still nothing wrong with it at all. I'm about to buy this product for a third time to play 4-way Multiplayer! DEFINITELY recommend this product.P.S. I just read the comment about collectorscardandgames and, although it's true that it's not a Nintendo product, it works fine. I've bought it from them two times with no hard times at all. Why didn't they just put it in their game boys and try it, I don't know..."
