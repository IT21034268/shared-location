2,Not for me,"I'm an experienced waxer, but this 'hard' wax was new for me. I didn't like it. I feel that you have to use way too much product to get the consistency correct so that you can then pull it off.I much prefer the 'soft' wax that you have to use cloth strips to remove. For $45 you really don't get a lot of wax. This wax is pretty - shiny blue. That makes it easy to see the tiny spots you may have missed. It heated up exactly like the instructions said it would in my microwave. But, I returned this to Sephora (which has an excellent return policy!!) after my attempt. It's just not for me.Instead, I got the 'Satin Smooth' electric wax heater and I LOVE that."
4,Not here yet ...,"What is the difference between ""BP 2004"" and ""BP: Stats ...""? Whatever the difference Amazon is sooo unhelpful.The book is a great reference tool the whole year long."
3,not much of a voyage,Trance Voyages isn't exactly the kind of album I consider will transport me into a different world. It's like listening to a downbeat techno. If you want to get into a transicional mood I advise something like Meat Beat Manifesto or maybe The Orb.
4,Helpfull!,"helpfull book, got me through a couple tough spots already, hard to find in the stores too!"
2,Not Very Helpful At All,"This strategy guide is really not necessary to play Destroy All Humans. First, the game is simple and the missions are self-explanatory. And second, if you suck at finding the hidden items, buy this or you may die. Otherwise, don't buy it. Plain and simple."
5,easily the best MO album,"everyone who says this is good but not as good as the first 2 i think are blinded by nostalgia or something. it doesnt help that inner worlds which came out right after this is unbelievably [bad]. the band on this is WAY tighter than the original MO and as good as goodman and laird were they are embarassed in every way by armstrong and ponty. while gayle moran doesnt do much on keyboards here, id rather hear her than hammer using some godawful distracting synth sounds.if youre afraid to listen to anything after birds of fire, get this immediately and check out what mahavishnu orchestra should be remembered for."
4,Another great Mahavishnu Orchestra release,Any Mahavishnu Orchestra release (at least with the first two lineups) is great. The same genious and musical mastery that you would have come to expect is there. I would say that I am not as crazy about this one as the others (particularly Inner Mounting Flame). It does not have as much of the WOW factor as some of the others. It is definitely a must have but it would not be the first I grab off the shelf to show them the awesome genious of Mahavishnu Orchestra.
4,"John McLaughlin, Mahavishnu Orchestra |",I purchased Visions of the Emerald Beyond Apocalypse and Between Nothingness & Eternity for my husband. He was thrilled with my choises.
5,Amazing,"I heard about Mahavishnu Orchestra from Megadeth's first guitarist Chris Poland. I bought Birds of Fire and was impressed. Then I purchased this masterpiece. Faith and Eternity's Breath part one and two and standouts not to be ignored. Cobham's insane drumming fits John's guitar like a glove. The violin is a nice surprise to a listener who usually focuses on the rock genre. Overall, just a great album, my favorite Mahavishnu record."
2,Mahavishnu I Is Better. So Is Apocalypse,"The Mahavishnu Orchestra, ApocalypseThe Mahavishnu Orchestra, Visions of the Emerald BeyondMahavishnu II was nowhere as good as MI, but it had its good points in this inaugural album, most notably the pristine of electric violinist Jean-Luc Ponty. McLaughlin still generates the heat but sounds like he is recycling more forceful work from earlier albums. The drumming, bass and keyboards are unexceptional but not notable. There is a pretty vocal solo by keyboardist Gayle Moran on ""Smile of the Beyond."" All in all, there's too much recycled in this album, the musicians (Ponty and McLaughlin excepted) are mediocre at best, and the Buddhist propagandizing seems egregious. But at least it's better than the next album, Visions of the Emerald Beyond, which has almost nothing to recommend it, except for its moments of ersatz funk (""Cosmic Strut,"" ""Can't Stand Your Funk"")."
3,Works good but...,The head on this vacuum is small so it is good for small jobs but not weekly cleaning!
1,"Theres is a trouble with this image, is a body lotion not a perfum, be aware","just be aware that this image is not according to product, this bottle of perfume showing is really a body lotion in other presentation, don't get confuse like happen to me."
4,Good for beginner but could be improved,"I did extensive sewing 20 years ago but am just now getting back to it. Thus, I bought this series to serve as a review of sewing techniques. So far I've been very pleased.As others have mentioned, Level 1 teaches you how to sew a simple skirt with an elastic waist. (Level 2 moves to a skirt with zipper and waistband.) My main criticism about the series is that Pam needs to be a little more enthusiastic and speak with less of a monotone. My criticism about Level 1 is that I think she should have gone into more detail about fabric selection and preparation -- a mistake at this stage could be both costly and aggravating for the beginning sewer. Thus, I suggest that this series be used in conjunction with good books on basic sewing techniques.I also agree with the comment regarding machine hems. I think many beginners will be frustrated with discovering that she covers only hand-sewn hems in Level 1. (She discusses machine hems briefly in Level 2.)"
3,its ok,"well for one this is thight as hell. two the inside dosent have anything in it, gust smothe. and the rings break easly."
3,It was okay,Nice packaging but item seemed very small in package. Was pleasantly surprised when it stretched to fit quite nicely. Gives a fun new dimension to mutual masturbation sessions with the wife.
2,Not really sure if we used it correctly....,"But that being said, it was too short and wouldn't stay on. The lube lasted about 5 seconds before needing to be reapplied, and don't even ask me what those other stretchy things are for. They did nothing for him!"
2,It's a Toy,"It's a toy, perhaps a conversation piece if you converse about such things. Not much beyond that."
1,I never got the sleeve!,"I ordered this for my partner and when we opened the box from Amazon,the individual package was opened and the sleeve was missing!! The other items were in the tray but the sleeve was missing. I am so upset!"
4,Hell in the Heavens - A Closer Look at Horrendous Missions,"This 140-page volume provides detailed accounts of some of the 8th Air Force's most hazardous and costly missions during World War II. Through post-mission debriefs, interviews with aircrews from both the United States and Germany, and extracts from official unit records, William Ness provides insights to the units' horrible and sometimes bizarre experiences.My only criticism of this book is that at times it is a little monotonous, with long recitations of loss figures and lists of KIAs. However, this is a very minor problem in an otherwise very good book."
2,A summary of Missing Aircrew Reports and official mission descriptions,"This is more a listing of official Missing Aircrew Reports and official mission summaries which results in its' feeling of routine repetition in its' writing style, a summary of documents.. A lot more could have been done with this."
2,Disappointed overall,It has no achievements similar to the first version. The color and graphics are limited and the play is very simple even on the highest and so called hardest settings. It is definately a scaled down version of the first game and if you were hoping for an advanced version then you will be completely letdown.
3,It'sOkay,"I do like the game, but I liked Luxor: Pharaoh's Challenge better. The game play and the graphics were better."
5,Nice adaptation of the PC version,Mumbo Jumbo did a good job adapting the PC version of Luxor to the PSP format. Graphics and game play are nearly identical.
5,Comfortable Mug,"I love this comfortable mug so much. Hugable, it fits my large hand well and is rather charming to look at too. I look forward to the first cup of coffee in the morning because it goes into this delightful mug."
1,NOT DELIVERED ORDERED 2 MONTHS AGO,"You are the worst company I have ever odered from. I ordered this sign and you ""resent"" it and I still have not received it. That was a month ago. Horrible service, horrible product availability, overall I WILL NEVER buy from your company. NEVER NEVER BUY THIS ITEM!!!!"
4,The British put three Italian battleships out of action.,"As the authors quite rightly put, this was the prelude to Pearl Harbor. The Italian Navy was stationed at this harbor and posed a threat to British sea routes to Egypt, India, Singapore, and Australia. A daring attack by 21 aircraft from a British aircraft carrier damaged three Italian battleships and put them out of action for six to nine months. Since they were in a heavily protected shallow harbor, it was indeed a daring attack, which the Japanese copied to place the American Pacific fleet out of action. The Japanese attack was on a much larger scale.One of the authors was a member of the attack group, and he gives his own account in the battle.This is a nice little read. The book is short and has plenty of photos. A determined reader could finish this book in two to three hours. Taranto was indeed the prelude the Pearl Harbor, but now few people realize this. With Lowry's perspective, this is good book about the Second World War."
4,Too good to be true?,"While the recent comment ""Comprehensive Resource on Credit Risk Management"" is very good in many ways, I wish it explains more in the low yielding instruments, like the wit it shows in the treatment of high yield."
4,Lovely book,I have not found a Grace Livingston Hill book that I did not enjoy. This is not a standout book but it did keep my interest from cover to cover. I recommend any of Ms. Hill's books to anyone of any age.
2,Not this one....,"Written apparently to document a group experience, the book felt tedious and uninspiring. Made it about halfway through and realized it was not going to get better. While recognizing that there are unexplainable events that beg for our attention and exploration, this book felt more like a consciousness raising group from the 70's with a contrived muse attached that was not remotely believable."
4,Intriguing Seth Book,"This book gives a very vivid account of life among the 1970s Sethians, and I really enjoyed it. It is thought-provoking, as well as interesting for those who study the channeling phenomena of the 1970s and 80s. I prefer Part I only because a large chunk of Part II details all the group members' dreams, without any explanations by Seth or anyone else, and frankly, reading other people's surreal dreams can get kinda boring. But overall, quite a fascinating book, and I'm glad it was written. Check out the Youtube videos of Jane Roberts channeling Seth while you read this, it really brings it alive."
5,Guide to the Birds of SE Asia,Good book with excellent illustrations and descriptions. Birders comming to SE Asia will find it very helpful if not indispensible. Only one problem though there are no distribution maps which would have come in handy
3,1/2 = 5 stars & 1/2 = 1 star,Side 1 on the origional lp was great . You could over look ocasional NOISES from Yoko Ono . Side 2 was all Yoko Ono moanimg and screaming . (Either it is an aquiored taste or finger nails on a chalk board)This cd always tends to be high priced for half a cd .(Maybe you can find at a 50 % discount)
5,the pressure plate to get,"this is as advertised, works well behind high hp engines. Takes no more effort than a stock piece but holds like a gorilla.This truly is for the street or stripI would reccomend this to anyone looking for the best of the best"
3,A Nice Song,"""Music of My Heart"" isn't one of my favorite songs of *NSYNC's, but I have to say that it's an overall good song. It was very nice to hear the group sing with someone else, especially someone like Gloria Estefan. The harmonies shared were very nice. Plus, the song went perfectly with the film it was from, ""Music of the Heart.""I would suggest this single to anyone who is a fan of *NSYNC's as well as a fan of the film!"
5,Great set! bulky packing though...,Works as expected! head where the socket connects to is a bit thick so you can't get into really tight spots though.
3,Bought New Got Used,Tools are great they came in a timely manner and were too good to be true. When I opened the case at least half of the sockets have finger prints on them caused by oil and the socket wrench was covered in finger prints and what appears to be oil. Really disappointed in this product only reason I'm giving a three star is due to it came on time and that all the sockets were included. If I wanted used tools I would go to Auto Zone.
3,Picture does not match product,"This set is of reasonable quality, given its price. Be cautious, however, that the case pictured may not be the one your receive. The two photos from Amazon depict a compact (11"" x 8"" approximately) case that has sockets in both halves. You may receive one that is 16"" x 10"" with sockets only in the lower portion, as displayed in N. Tung's customer images. The tool set appears to be the same in either collection.That was a bit of a let down for me, as this was a gift intended to replace a small (and incomplete) set being used by a space conscious relative. If there were a way to exchange it for what's in the picture, I would do it in an instant, but that does not seem possible."
4,Good set. Hard to beat the value.,"This is no snap on kit, however for the money it will do just about everything you want it to. I would avoid the spark plug tool they provide as it has a rubber holder that in time will be left on one of your plugs and cause you no end of trouble.Great value. Nice finish and good weighting."
4,"Well made Tools, Cheaply made case","These tools are pretty complete for small jobs and item and feel tight and strong.I can only hope they don't rust as bad as all my other sockets, which of course being crv or crovan they should not.The first picture is false the second one is right for what I received.I bought them to use and sell and have sold one already so I recommend getting them on sale seem like a good price.To the bad news the case is thin blow molded plastic, latches feel weak but otherwise tolerable.I still say a strong 4/5 even if you have to keep them in a coffee can...."
4,Good set for the price,"If you're planning to do the occasional car maintenance then this set is for you: good quality and cheap. If you're a pro, maybe you should spend a bit more. But this one is perfectly adequate for the average customer.Myself, I'm happy with it."
4,NIce tools for the money but not top of the line,The carrying case is probably what makes this a good buy. the choice of tools is a little limited but okay but the case is key to not losing them and knowing when you have left a socket on the driveway. not a bad buy and priced right.
4,Excellent tools for everyday use,"This is a everyday useable set of tools, I find it is compact but only one thing was missing was adapter for larger sockets"
2,Overpriced and misrepresenting picture,"I found this same thing for less money at Wal-Mart. Also, the plastic carrying case was not the same as shone in the picture. There are no sockets stored in the lid, which makes the case larger than it needs to be."
3,decent socket set,"I got this socket set at age 46 to replace my decades old Craftsman socket set which was stolen. I therefore am going to base my review on comparison to that set. This set is of slightly lower quality than my old Crafstman set. It is much better quality than the cheap sets you get at the auto parts store.I figure I don't need as high a quality tool set now; hopefully my days of swapping engines and fixing clutches myself out of necessity are over. I do want a good quality set so I can tighten a fan belt or tighten a bolt on the mower. This set meets that need.One thing I like is there is a lifetime guarantee on this Stanley set. If I mail a broken tool to a PO box in Tukwila, WA, they suposedly will replace it."
2,Socket wrench doesn't reliably work in reverse,"The socket wrench didn't reliably work in reverse. Had to disassemble the wrench, and remove what seemed to be an extra spring. Then manually adjusted the screws to the right tension. It now seems to work, but the craftmanship is apparently poor..."
2,Ratchet is too stiff,"I bought this Stanley socket wrench set to remove a refrigerator door (and for future use). But the ratchet action on the wrench is so stiff that it doesn't work unless I am holding the socket in place with my other hand, which is awkward. I wasn't able to use this with one hand because turning the wrench in the ratchet direction would turn the bolt in the reverse direction rather than ratchet the wrench. Also, the socket with the closest match in size to the bolts still seemed a bit loose when turning, enough to make turning a slippery business. Maybe I was expecting too much, but this tool was disappointing."
3,"Sleek, but good luck setting it, or actually seeing the time!","The watch LOOKS fantastic. However, I was definitely disappointed:1. The programming booklet that comes with it does not actually contain the directions on how to program this particular model. I called Diesel and a customer service person only had that same booklet to refer to, and could not help me. I called the Diesel/Fossil store nearest me (nearly an hour away) and they could not help over the phone as they only had the very same book I had to refer to. They recommended I make the (one hour) drive to see it if someone there could set it. AAAAARGH.2. In the illustration, the read-out looks fine. But the truth is that the light behind the digital numbers is actually very dim, even when you press the button to increase the light.It's a gorgeous, sleek watch but I was a bit embarrassed to give it as a gift once I realized how hard it was to actually read, and that there was no way for the thing to be programmed."
5,pretty bad ass,"I bought this watch for my boyfriend for christmas lets see it's July and it's still working great and looks awesome. He loves it, it has this futuristic look to it and you press the button on the side and the numbers show saving battery. Shipping was fast. So overall great product and service."
4,Diesel Watch DZ7069,Product arrived on time. Very good delivery. Love the style. Had some trouble seeing the time in daylight but nightime vision is great.
2,Broken Watch,"I did receive the watch, but its broken... the metal part in the wrist end looses everytime I try to wear the watch... I have to assemble the watch everytime I want to wear it... It is very annoying to do this everytime I want to use it.. when I get to attach the metal part to the watch I have to wear it with extreme care because the metal part can fall off...I can't return this item to the seller because I'm from outside US, and cannot return it as easy as if I lived in the US... So I will have to bring the watch to a watchmaker to fix it..."
3,Fine material undermined by poor format,"The actual content of this work is solid. The author provides a description of each leader's 'vision' for the world. The degree of detail varies from leader to leader, depending on the amount of research material available and the scope of the leader's ideas, but that's to be expected. Where the work falls down for me is in the way the information is presented. It would benefit a *great* deal by the inclusion of more maps, especially where the author describes the sweeping changes planned by Hitler, for instance. The organisation of each entry also leaves a bit to be desired. Breaking up the text with sub-headings that call out specific regions or topics would really have helped for those who want to refer back to the book for specific details at a later date. At around 250 pages of fairly large font, the book is also a bit on the brief side for my tastes.A decent introduction to the various leaders' objectives, but I was hoping for more 'meat' to this meal."
5,Very Intresting Study Of WW 2 Leaders,"From reading this book, I would have to say that the visions of the major war leaders of the second world war of a post-war world that the book puts forth is very intresting and in some cases(Hitler in particular) very frightening. It was also good to see how those hopes were or weren't realized in the actual post-war world with Franklin Roosevelt's being the closest to actually come to fruition.This is a very intresting book and I would definitely recommend it."
4,Visions of Victory,Excellent overview of WW II leaders & their global perspectives & objectives by a renown Univ. of NC historian.
3,lopsided,"This bag was a good deal, but the strap is not centered and so it is lopsided when you carry it over your shoulder. I guess this might serve a purpose to keep it close to your body, but its more annoying than anything."
2,Great until you need to change the battery...,"This watch is fine unless/until you need to change the battery! Changing the battery is an easy process - RESETTING the watch is another thing altogether. After searching the web & Timex website (NO help) - we've given up. I guess that's what they want you to do so you'll just buy another watch - seems pretty wasteful to me. If anyone has a suggestion for how to successfully reset the watch, please post the info!! Yes, I see the word ""RES"" & yes the watch blinks but it does NOT reset.We're NOT replacing this with another Timex!"
2,Not the finest 20 minutes from Nightline,"An avid Lucille Ball fan, I have been trying to add every video I can to my collection. Since there is not alot in the biographical area of the great comdian, I purchased this video in hopes of learning more about the great queen of comedy. This episode of Nightline is hosted by Jeff Greenfield, not Ted Koppel. After the first 5 to 10 minutes of clips (mostly from ""I Love Lucy""), the program tells little about Lucy, her life or her death. The guests are Sid Ceasar and Jerry Lewis. Neither are very touching. The questions asked by Jeff Greenfield are lame. This is not a tribute to Lucy, it's not even a decent piece of reporting by the ABC News team. Were it not for one comment from Jerry Lewis and the fact it is about Lucy, I would have only given it one star. Spend your money on another selection."
2,Does not work with WMP,"This player doesn't work with Windows Media Player. This player works by dragging files in Windows Explorer so any protected content WMAs will only cause a format error. If you are only playing songs you took off your own CDs then this player should work fine, but if you have any music you've downloaded from a Napster type service then you are out of luck."
1,Are you kidding me. . ?,"From page 111 of Feisal Abdul Rauf's book, ""What's Right with Islam""""It also would not be a violation of church-state separation to have a subsidiary entity within the judiciary that employs religious jurists from diverse religious backgrounds to comment on the compliance of certain decisions with their religious views and to provide guidance to their religious communities on how kosher or Shariah compliant these decisions are. ' - Feisal Abdul RaufThere is so much more insanity in this book. From Muslims didn't commit 9/11, to calling Qaradawi a respected scholar, to the convoluted analogies, and false equivalencies-it is the work of a mad man.Everyone should read this book. Rauf is absolutely insane.Spread the word."
1,Dodge every sensitive issue,"Well written but dodges every touchy issue. Womens rights, minorities etc. One thing is to say how things ought to be and another to explain why things are the way they are."
1,Typical PC Propoganda,"This is the typical sugary PC nonsense that lefty liberals love. It presents a false picture of Islamic history and ideology. It makes one wonder if Spencer isn't right about ""stealth Jihad."" It certainly reinforces the head in the sand attitude of the ""useful idiots"" that have become instant Middle East experts. Don't waste your time and money!"
2,Condition of the book was unsatisfactory,The book was torn and I am particulalry sensitive about the condition of my books. I did not read it.
5,Great book buy!,Well written and informative book. Thanks for such a great buy with quick delivery in safe packaging from seller. Thanks again for your service. Suzy
1,amazing,"I was so looking forward the the purchase of this cd. The few songs I heard I realy liked. This must be an amazing cd..at the price of 700.00+ dollars. Yhe price is more than absurb. I was hoping it was a misprint. I so will not spend money like that!!!...Sherie Hebdon, Sunset Utah"
1,An hour of some clod waliking on crunching leaves,"This is an insulting fraud and a rip-off. I expected to hear the well-recorded sounds of indigenous Appalachian birds, wildlife and maybe a trickling brook. Instead all I heard on the ENTIRE CD is just some clod endlessly plodding through dry leaves - crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch ... Once about every five minutes he stops for a few seconds where we eventually may or may not hear one feeble, poorly recorded chirp from a bird. Then he goes stomping along again. This goes on for an hour. Aesthetically, it's about as interesting as hearing yourself eat a bowl of corn flakes. Useless."
5,Bryan Is The Best!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I Just Recently Bought This CD. It Is So Great. This CD Countains 1994's ""Look At Me Now"", 1995's #1 Hit ""Someone Else's Star"", 1996's ""Rebecca Lynn"", ""I'm Not Sussopped To Love You Anymore"", ""So Much For Pretending"", 1997's ""That's Another Song"", The #1 Hit ""Sittin' On Go"", And ""Love Is The Right Place"", And 1998's ""One Small Miracle."" You Might Love This CD If You Love Bryan."
5,Thanks for the memories,"Bob, it's as if you were peeking into my household eon's ago! I just could not put the book down...I was continually shaking my head ""yes, yes"" and just loving the memories.Everyone needs to have this book to validate the hilarious hair-raising craziness that is part of our everyday lives as parents.Thanks for bringing back the memories."
5,A lesson in sanity,"This book is a fun filled chatterbox of zany humor about family dynamics. As I was reading Schwartz's comical account of bringing home their first baby from the hospital, I was nodding in agreement as I was laughing out loud. Being a new grandmother and helping to bring in my first grandchild along with being with the new parents for several weeks, this book sparked tons of memories and a good look into the future.The author, in a witty smart style, explains his theory about determining a child's temperament, the quick fix for doll babies, the dilemmas of dressing children and creating new family traditions.The author found writing his adventures to be a lesson in retaining his own sanity and better than therapy. Readers, too, will enjoy that effect. Would Somebody Please Send Me to My Room is a gratifying side-splitter. Every parent and soon to be parent should read this book.Author's proceeds benefit Make-A-Wish Foundation.Sherry Russell"
4,Definite keeper for future reference!,"Although we used the 8th ed in a recent course, it is probably the most well thought out O.R. intro you will find - good relevant case study material for the interested practitioner as well. Not too mathematically rigorous w.r.t. research, but examples are detailed enough, and the book also has a great selection of seemingly real-life practice problems. I especially appreciate ancillary chapters (e.g. crystal ball, project mgmt) being kept on the CD-ROM, it makes it a lot easier to carry and read on the train!"
2,"Good problems, bad explanations!","Operations Research isn't that hard but this book makes it seem so. Overly complicated explanations coupled with a weak theoretical background (often explaning things without providing proofs) make it a pain to read. On the upside, there are a gazillion good problems to practice on."
2,Excessively long-winded,The book may be suitable for some people but I found the explanations excessively long-winded. I frequently found myself crossing out an entire paragraph and a writing summary sentence in the margin. I do not think it will make a good reference because it is very easy to get lost in its verbosity. This is problematic in the real world when you need to refresh your memory of a small detail under time pressure. This book is useful for learning new concepts for the first time but you will quickly outgrow it.
1,Worst Textbook Ever,"I have a strong math background and I can safely say that this is the worst textbook ever written. It is poorly written with extremely ambiguous explanations of concepts. Example problems are vague and do not adequately cover the topics taught in the text. Furthermore, they seem to pull some ""necessary"" concepts out of thin air, making it difficult for anyone but the authors to understand. The accompanying courseware is another problem. First off, it doesn't work on most newer computers. You have to download a patch from McGraw-Hill. Even then, it is antiquated-looking (MS-DOS) and constantly crashes even the most high-powered computers. On top of this, the book is extremely overpriced. Stay away from it at all costs."
2,Book Review,"For an introductory level text the book is very complex in its approach. Graphics are of poor quality (black and white). One positive is that the math used is college level algebra for the most part. The book is fairly comprehensive in scope. Not a lot of focus on the use, influence and relationship of Statistics in Operations Research. Also would have liked to have seen a chapter or two on decision making..."
1,Worst Textbook ever,What the author tries to covered in one page could be effectively covered using a few sentences with good supporting examples.
4,I recomend it to every Operations Research students,"As a portuguese student, at Universidade Lusíada, i found this book an excelent manual. It's only a shame that this book doesn't develop more the chapter of defining a linear programing problem. Nevertheless, i found it very elucidating and easy to read to everyone"
2,I've read better!,I hope that you are a Literature minor because you're going to need it if you plan to understand the not so complicated concepts through all of the jargon. The courseware is all you really need to solve the problems but the book enjoys make the reader suffer. Oh well....
5,clash in the box!,i got this box set a few years ago and i have to say it's one of the best out there! while some bands put out box sets with just their hits on them and price them high the clash give you not only their best loved songs but they give you unreleased songs/live songs/demos/and different edited of songs! they also add the songs that made it onto the uk version of their 1st album and not the u.s.! the books that come with the box are great! there is one cd book size that contains most of the lyrics from the box(something the studio albums failed to do but will have when they are re-done and relesed with original artwork/pictures in jan. 2000-this set will also get re-mastered and re-done in a smaller package! )the other book is a book that is the size of the box and contains articles on the clash and the band and people around the clash's take on the songs on the 3 cds! )this box set is worth every penny and a must have for every clash fan!
5,Good Deal,"I had forgotten how good the Clash were in their day. This box set brought back a lot of memmories. The set used a lot of material from through out their career. As a bonus, there is an interview book of the Clash explaining the songs. There is also a small book with all the lyrics. The box set is an all around good deal."
3,Black and white photographs,"This book is very detailled and pleasant to read. However, I was very disappointed by the pictures the book contains: none of them is in color, which I think would have been necessary, especially for the most recent models."
5,Most informative book out on this subject,"As a New Zealander with an interest in police cars from all over the world this book is the best I have seen, and I already own around fifteen books devoted to police vehicles. The only thing wrong with it is the photos are in black and white, a colour version would make this book unbeatable."
1,Encyclopedia of American Police Cars,Would have loved to buy this but lost interest due to the fact that the mayority of the pictures are in black & white!
5,BANGIN!!!,"Just so everyone know's this Mojado is electronic artists Mr. Sam & Dimitri Andreas, not the Latin group ""Groupo Mojado"". I just wanted to clear that up, I've read a couple other reveiews that really slammed this album because they were expecting something else, that said, this album PHOOKIN' ROCKS!!!!! Buy this album, every single track is amazing. Awesome hard tech, pure quality, there've only been a couple other techno album's out there that've been this good. If you like this try ""Guy McAffer's - Special Needs Disco"". Don't even think about it, just buy the CD, you won't regret it!!!"
1,P.O.S. !!! Old worn out game. Should be no more than $5 at a garage sale. DO NOT BUY!,Old worn out game. Should be no more than $5 at a garage sale. DO NOT BUY! Ripoff! I have no idea why this is so expensive.
3,Great idea,"The conceit is music associated one way or another with the great artist Francisco Goya. Stylistically it ranges from early 19th century Fernando Sor to the prominent modern composer and educator Angelo Gilardino.The idea works very well as a concept, and I think it would work as well as a recital program.Unfortunately, William Feasley cannot really pull it off. Some of this music is very technically difficult, and Feasley often finds himself on very thin ice. Anyone who has heard Julian Bream's recording of transcriptions of Albeniz and Granados is bound to be disappointed (for example) by Feasley's renderings of excerpts from""Goyescas"".Still, as an intermediate guitarist who could stand to learn more about repertoire, finding the ""Caprichos de Goya"" by Castelnuovo-Tedesco was a delight.I would recommend this album to anyone who would appreciate a well-constructed program of interesting music, who is not going to be put off by the more than occasional clams and errors."
5,This is a GREAT toy!,My daughter LOVES this toy. She continually goes back to it and plays with all the features. She started playing with it at 16 months and the toy has kept her occupied as she develops. She is almost 20 months now and this toy remains at the top of her favorites list. She loves to slide people down the slide and have the merry go round play the music. Plus the little tic tac toe game helped her with her finger dexterity.This has been the best toy!
2,POOR QUALITY.,"BEING A BIG FAN OF CHARLES BRONSON I WAS HOPING THAT POP FLIX WOULD DO A GOOD CONVERSION LIKE THEY DID FOR THE JOHN WAYNE COLLECTION VOL.01 AND VOL.02BUT VIEWING COLD SWEAT, CHINO, LOLA AND SOMEONE BEHIND THE DOOR I WAS REALLY UPSET.EXTREMELY POOR QUALITY EVEN IF IT DOES SAY DIGITALLY MASTERED ON THE COVER.I HAVE COLD SWEAT AND HONOUR AMONG THIEVES ON REGION 2 AND ITS SUPERB QUALITY.BOTTOM LINE CHARLES BRONSON COLLECTION VOL.01 IS NOT THE BEST VIEWABLE IF YOU HAVE TIME TO WASTE.ALSO RIDER ON THE RAIN IS ANOTHER FILM TO MISS THERE ARE SEVERAL COVER VERSION OUT THERE BUT ALL THE SAMETHE PICTURE QUALITY IS MODERATE TAKE IT FROM ME I HAVE 3 VERSION OF ALL THE SAME TITTLES WITH DIFFERENT COVERS AND STUDIO AND THEY ARE ALL VIEWABLE BUT NOT ENJOYABLE.MAYBE ONE DAY SOMEONE WILL GET IT RIGHT. UNTIL THEN IF YOU'RE A CHARLES BRONSON FAN AND WANT THEM BUY IT BUT DON'T EXPECT FANTASTIC PICTURE. OR SOUND.I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WITH ALL THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE TODAY STILL THESE CRAP DVDS COME OUT."
2,Poor Transfer on part of this set,"I recently ordered this set of 4 movies. I have watched the first disc and the transfer of Cold Sweat was ok, but the video transfer for Chino is very poor. On dark scenes, the blacks blur when there is any movement. It's like a poor divx copy. If you want to see a decent version of that movie, look elsewhere. I haven't watched disc 2 yet, but because of the lack of quality on half of the two I have seen, I am already disappointed. Bronson movies rock, but they deserve a decent transfer to DVD. This set doesn't measure up. I'll have to look for another release. I will try one that doesn't try to fit 2 movies on one disc. Perhaps the quality will be better."
5,i can still take swim lessons,I was wearing Finis Zoomer fins in swim class and they were rubbing the tops of my feet raw. I now wear these neoprene socks and can use the fins comfortably! Excellet comfort and a great bargain. I wear a women's shoe size 9.5-10 and the medium neoprene sock is a great fit.
2,SLIPPER DOES NOT FIT UNDER FLIPPER,These are comfortable slippers. They feel sturdy. The did not fit inside my flippers. I doubt that they will fit under any other pair. They are far too bulky.
3,"Open heel, not suitable for leashing finns.","Makes fins use more comfortable. I think sizes are quite big and are not suitable for leashing fins, in the water they really stretch. Published photos are quite confusing, pay attention: OPEN HEEL. I bought them to do bodyboard, I think has not been a good option."
5,Just right,"I wanted protection for my feet during physical therapy in a pool. These flipper slippers work great, although I did not realize when I ordered that the heel is open. Fit is good and they are comfortable. The pool deck is slippery but the product seems stable and I have no issues with traction. They dry out reasonable fast and do not shrink."
1,body glove flipper slipper/what a waste of money,"i recently purchased this pair of slipper socks and was greatly dissappointed. I love to swim and when I got into the pool with these slippers they almost flipped off of my feet. I should have known that you get what you pay for. I thought that after reading the other reviews that it was worth a try so I did. However, in retrospect, I wish I would have paid more and ended up happy. Don't waste your time or money on these shoes, if you need a really good pair of aqua shoes go for it, spend a bit more but you will be happier for it in the long run. So off to the Salvation Army with these. I hope that someone else will enjoy them because honestly I don't."
3,Open Heal..,"These socks have an open heal, though not shown in picture. They also run VERY big. I wear a 9 Wide and had to send them back and order a medium. They are still a little big. Overall the price is great, i wear them under my swim fins and have had no problems with them."
5,body glove,Excelent product. I realy like because it's very confortable and resistent. Very important to protect and warm my foot. The price was nice. Thanks.
2,Missing a great song,Mott's version of You Really Got Me was one of the greatest instrumental covers of all time. It's missing from this compilation.
3,Dizzy production,"I have the 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2012 videos to go with this one. I have to say this is the most high speed video of the bunch. By that I mean the video constantly switchs from one model to another at a rate that I was getting car sick. As a photographer, I enjoy the Sports Illustrated videos that take an easy pace and focus on one model at a time or at least spend some time with each model as they are being photographed. This video breaks away from that and flashes from model to model without being able to really appreciate what is happening."
1,not useful,"This book was a waste of time in my opinion. If most of your events are professionally catered and held at the Waldorf, you really don't need to do much except write a check. I was hoping for useful advice for the home entertainer - this is not it."
5,An Extremely Helpful Guide for the Female Entrepreneur,"I read Dr. Moore's book a year ago as I started my business as a female entrepreneur, and now a year later I re-read it- and find all the lessons even more relevant and helpful. Any woman considering starting her own business should read this book several times. I have learned quite a bit over the last year, and Dr. Moore's book tremendously helped reduce my learning curve (not that it's been easy).As a self- employed consultant focusing on women's leadership, I have found especially useful the author's pointers on negotiation, how to invest my time, and how to make the most of my networking resources. Her real-life examples and advice from successful female entrepreneurs and their stories is most inspiring and a continuing source of strength for me. My business has continued to grow, and I truly appreciate the opportunity to have learned from the other entrepreneurial women in this book."
2,*yawn*,"The first time you listen to these songs it's sounds pretty cool. Second time divide that by 2, and so on. Honestly, they could have achieved everything they have on the album with any of their songs bar cure for the itch and by myself. By myself was the only song interesting enough to listen to more than say 5 times. Unfortunately it .... I recommend that this album is listened to though, try and rent it but don't buy it, it's so boring after a while. Try a decent band like Radiohead, or A Perfect Circle."
4,They work,I have a Warn rock crawler front bumper on my 07 JK. I used these to attach a univeral Reese tow bar. They worked well and were only a grade 8 washer to wide for the shackle mount on the bumper. I towed the JK from Maryland to OBX with no problems and at normal highway speeds.
5,Loved it!,"This movie was fantastic. It was a bummer having to use the subtitles to understand most of it, as I dont speak much spanish, but I enjoyed the film none the less. My husband reads the book series this was made from and he was SO excited to get this movie and to watch it. Loved it."
4,"Actually a decent, however...","only with the caveat that you've read the series (at least to The King's Gold). Yes, it could seem a bit disjointed, even if you have read the books, but to me it came over as more of a stylized interpretation. Perez-Reverte's writing feels somewhat stylized to me as well, so i rather thought it worked. Don't go into this film looking for big budget stuff, it's more like an art-house Errol Flynn movie."
5,great movie with a difference,"The previous reviewer has done a good job describing the different plots so there's no need for repetition here.This is a great movie and by far the best role I've seen Mortensen play. The settings and costumes are beautiful and the story, though sometimes difficult to follow, always keeps the viewer interested. But it's Mortensen's character that is particularly well portrayed. He's not the perfect hero at all. Capable of cruelty and deception somehow we still warm to him and admire him. And that's Mortensen's achievement. All the sub-plots come together well too. For those of us who think that it's more and more rare to see a 'new' movie because most of what's produced today is basically a re-hash of the usual stories and themes, then here's one worth watching and something different from the usual Hollywood mass production."
2,Visually beautiful but unengaging and muddled,"The episodic, incoherent script patches together highlights from FIVE historical adventure novels spanning a 20-year period of the 17th century. This film takes for granted that we already know something of the era's Spanish political, literary and military history. Even Spaniards found this movie confusing, so what hope do we foreign viewers have?Mortensen is fine in the title role, though the Argentine Spanish of his youth occasionally creeps through the European accent he learned for the film.In fact, the whole cast is good, but they're trapped in a hopeless script that leaps over plot points too fast while still somehow remaining plodding and dull. I like the frankness of the battle scenes though: in English-language films, by comparison, war often comes off as a bit too clean and tidy.The Alatriste novels have a lot to offer, and this probably should have been made as a TV miniseries."
3,Alatriste,"I do not wish to repeat all that has been previously said about Alatriste. I concur with the majority of reviewers; however I wish to add my own thoughts about one of the failures of the movie. In trying to compress 4 to 5 novels in the space of one movie it has a disjointed feel and only those viewers who are aficionados of Perez-Reverte know what is going on. As I recall the novels are the memoirs of Inigo, Alatriste's page/adopted son. Would it not have been advantageous to have his voice over to connect for viewers the plot as it developed over time? We only hear a voice over at the start and the conclusion. Perhaps it can still be done if this video is ever released in the English speaking world. Personally, I enjoyed the Spanish language edition; it adds much more authenticity to the movie."
3,Possessing Your Promised Land: Biblical Principles for Real Estate Acquisition,"I have not fully perused this book as of this review. What I have read is interesting, although it is not what I had in mind when ordering this publication. I will finish the reading and perhaps will comment on it at a later date."
4,"Bill Gunter U S Marshall ""Terror To Evil""","Thank you for making this product available. My wait period was not long at all. When the product arrived it was in ""like new"" condition. I could'nt find this product anywhere else. Not even on EBAY. Now when I look for a product I always go to AMAZON. They are quick, reliable, easy to work with, and you usually get what your looking for at affordable prices. Thanks AMAZON."
2,Rated R ain't what it used to be,"Used to a rated R on a romcom meant some racy bedroom scenes and some adult language. In the last few years it means the raunchiest forms of sexual humor the writers can drum up - as in junior high locker room level and worse. The main character, as portrayed as raised by upper society Bostonians, was a completely unbelievable back story given the character's portrayal as essentially a very crude minded slut - but of course one with a good heart (presumably that makes any character palatable for us to identify with).Anna Faris has definite potential as a comedic actress, but even if she was cast into higher quality material than this film, I'll always be tainted by the characterization she portrayed here (ugh). It was her career choice, of course.Wife and I agreed we couldn't recommend this movie to anyone we know. And we're giving up completely on any romcom movie that is rated R."
5,Very funny and great acting from Anna Faris,"This is a great romantic comedy for mature audiences, Lots of fun and great acting performance from Anna Faris. Chris Evans also does a good job."
3,It's Got My Number,"I really thought I was going to hate this movie. The trailers made it look like one of the year's worst films, and I was prepared to add it to my list of The Worst Films of 2011. The truth is that I was pleasantly surprised by the movie and am happy to report that I smiled more often than I scowled, chuckled more often than I groaned, and actually felt satisfied when it all ended. After all of the nasty, so-called artsy fare I've sat through lately, a movie like What's Your Number was refreshing, if only because it was so upbeat and cheerful. Yes, it's cliched, and if you don't see the ending coming, you haven't been watching enough movies; but, when a film contains such good will, what's the harm in kicking back and enjoying it?"
4,Watch the extended version!,"I cannot stress this enough. Watch the extended edition. I rented this movie and watched the extended edition and thought it was a good movie. Later I watched it with a friend on TV and felt sorry for all the people who paid to see it in theaters. If I had seen the movie in theaters, I would have demanded my money back. But the extended edition is worth your money."
2,All the worst parts of a chick flick,"What's your number was boring, vulgar, and predictable, all the worst elements of a chick flick. Like many chick flicks, a girl worries about finding true love, encounters ex lovers, and ends up marrying the guy right in front of her nose. The jokes weren't particularly funny, mostly just vulgar. I'd recommend passing on this one."
2,"quirky comedy, chick flick movie that isn't sure about its true identity","girl revists 20 ex-boyfriends to see if one of them was her true love and discovers she has feelings for the guy next door who has one night stands and can't stay in a committed relationship. together they find their true selves & they live happy ever after. anna feris and chris evans have good chemestry on screen and their relationship is the only thing that makes the movie work, the rest of the movie is confused at what its trying to be. is it a chick flick or a slightly ranchy film? the movie suffers from crude dialogue and pleanty of sex jokes that just don't work. I laughed at some things but I would say its very mediocre, it has it moments but has some problems."
4,Some Truly Hilarious Moments,"When I saw the trailers for this movie, I really wanted to watch it. However, ""Rotten Tomatoes"" put me off it. It got only 28% votes! But when I saw it on Amazon Instant Videos, I knew I'd rent it. I am glad I did. I watched it with a girlfriend, after a long day at work, expecting a crappy movie. But I was presently surprised. I found myself laughing quite hard at several points in the movie. Yes, the story is predictable in terms of plot. But Anna Faris is simply brilliant in terms of comic timing. The jokes in the script are good. And I absolutely love the wedding vows that the sister character and her husband say to each other. I'd say WATCH. This movie is for gals who like toilet humor especially! I highly recommend it."
4,VERY Good Movie,"THIS WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE. IT WAS FUNNY, SWEET, AND THE CHARACTERS WERE LIKABLE. THE STORY WAS CUTE EVEN THOUGH THE PREVIEWS FOR THE MOVIE BASICALLY GAVE THE ENDING AWAY. REGARDLESS, IT'S A EVERY GOOD CHICK FLICK OR ROMANTIC COMEDY. A LOT OF THE CHARACTERS/SITUATIONS WERE RELATABLE. OBVIOUSLY ITS NOT MEANT FOR CHILDREN AND IMMATURE AUDIENCES."
1,Why are these movies still even being made?!,"I was very disappointed in this movie. I am glad it did as horrible as it did. Is there really a ""number"" that women simply can't go over before they are doomed to never having a meaningful relationship? Let's not even go there with how many women men can be with before they are judged worthless. That number doesn't exist. I've never seen or heard anything more demeaning and symbolic of modern day misogynism."
2,jeannie,"There are way better romantic comedies out there. Wait til this one is free on cable, netflix or amazon prime."
2,So so,"Pretty predictable, which did not surprise me but I wanted to watch a lighthearted movie so I guess it fit the bill."
3,Enjoyable comedy,This was a rather good and entertaining movie. There were some funny spots. Worthchecking out. This would be considered a girly flick.
5,Great Ana Farris movie,I loved this movie! I could have done without seeing Joel McHale's naked butt. Why does Hollywood think nudity is so funny and original?Other than that I really enjoyed this movie and had some great laughs.
5,Unexpectedly Great,"Ana Faris is quirky and funny in this movie - she really carries the humor throughout the film. But Chris Evans holds his own, and is rather endearing. I had low expectations, but this far surpassed them. A fun and light movie!"
3,Sweet movie,"It was a sweet movie. Great for movie night with my sister. It is a little dorky, glad I didn't see it in the theater and waitd for it to come out this way."
4,"A good, typical romantic comedy with a quirky edge","I enjoyed this movie. It's a typical romantic comedy, but there are some quirky elements that really make it unique. Anna Faris' portrayal of the bubbly and airy Ali Darling was enjoyable, and Chris Evans (as Colin) was extremely charming. They make a good comedic duo."
3,Movie was ok,"Would I want to watch this several times? Probably not. Wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. Good to watch once...more than that, no."
5,Excellent concert dvd,"I have seen two other Go West concerts and various otherfootage and have to say this is the best of them all.The sound quality is amazing and the band is at top form.Peter Cox delivers such a great performance, and what Inoticed was that his ability to jump from a hard edgedsong to a soulful ballad flawlessly. This dvd has in myopinion the best concert version of S.O.S. I've seen yet.The band is truly top notch. Contains a really extensiveinterview with Peter & Richard that was quite interestingand at times very funny. To clarify, the out-takes appearat the end of the show when the credits are rolling. Thehistory is there also, I've seen it. It's a slideshow typeof image gallery with captions. The song select menu is abit strange but after awhile I got used to it. The choiceof songs was perfect. Personally, one of my favorite concertdvds Remember to play it in 5.1 Surround, the effect isawesome."
5,A true romantic keeper,"If you like family, romance, and people who aren't perfect, this book is for you.Karen Wagner finally found the love of her life, the problem..., he Grant Russell is a father of 6.No matter how much he wants to get involved with Karen, he has his family is his first concern.Karen not only understands this, but she applauds it.Karen falls for all the kids and the father, and it takes little for Grant to fall for Karen.But...Grant can't understand anyone but himself and his late wife loving all his kids the way he does.The only problem with the books is the same problem all books with kids have; and that is the kids disappear when the H/H want time together.It is a great book. Funny and romantic. A keeper"
1,COUGH DROP COMMERICAL,"The alpine horns brings immediately to mind the cough drop commericals. The sound of the streams would have been nice, in fact, I would love to hear the streams without the music. The horns kept ruining the alpine streams for me, this CD will not be played to get to sleep at my house."
1,Don't buy,"This microwave is very small, a dinner plate barely fits inside, but this is a good thing when you have a tiny kitchen. I was also able to overlook the flimsy door and the fact that it had less power than my previous microwave, I adjusted times accordingly. However I am giving this microwave only 1 star because I have to return it after only having used it for one month due to paint chipping off the interior. I replaced my previous 9 year old microwave because it just started to chip paint and yet this one chips after only a month. Very disappointing!!!"
1,An Overnight Transformation from Good to Bad,Everything seemed right about this compact microwave when it first arrived. I have another Sharp model elsewhere that I love and had high expectations for this one. Size was perfect. Price was perfect. My son's girlfriend remarked about how quiet it was compared to her's of another brand. And it was! Then about a month after I started using it it began to make a terrible racket and has stayed that way ever since. It emits a constant sound reminiscent of a street being jackhammered! I still use it but stare at it expecting something to happen. I also noticed that when the room is dark I can see the interior light around the control panel. Makes me wonder further about it's construction. Reviews were a mixed bag and expect I'll be soon shopping for a new microwave.
2,Fair,"Needed small microwave for microwave shelf. A bit flimsy, and difficult to clean. Works well, so far."
5,nice microwave,"the microwave is really good, and it got right on time, before I expected actually. It's bigger than I though, and very easy to use. The design is very nice."
4,Can't do without the minute button...,"Yea, I got my Sharp back. I had a Sharp for 5 yrs. and decided to get a new one when I discovered that the plug seemed to be corroding. It still worked fine, but to be safe I got a Hamilton Beach at Walmart...wow, what a piece of junk which I returned. So happy with my new Sharp. 800 watts works well for me, it heats evenly and what I have always loved about the Sharps is the minute button which starts automatically when pressed and can be pressed multiple times. I use that function constantly...so easy. I really like the smaller size, too. If this lasts 5 years I will be happy. Am giving it 4 stars cause the display is not lighted, but still am happy with this purchase. PS - another good thing - the popcorn button, which if pressed once starts automatically, is just right for heating a mug for coffee or tea (2:35)....press once and it's done!"
1,Broke down after 6 months,"I'm interested to see the other comments about how this microwave died after a year because that's been my experience too. I bought it in June 2009. It hasn't entirely stopped working, but the clock and the keypad numbers 1, 4, and 7 don't work. It's essentially useless and I will have to replace it after only 7 months. I advise against getting this model!"
5,Good Solid Product,It does what it says and it does it well. It's easy to use and performs like a champ. I'm very pleased.For some reason Amazon shipped it in a box three times larger than needed. As a result the outside box was collapsed on the top (all that empty space and other boxes piled up on it in the truck) but the microwave box was undamaged.
4,works great,Works great. We choose this for its compact size. We have had good luck with sharp procucts. We use multible micro waves in the kitchen of our country store. This is in constant use all day 7 days a week. The only improvement would be to make the start button lable larger and separate from the other buttons. Searching for the start during a fast paced task can be frustrating. Our other sharp model has a better button set up. In normal home use this might not be an issue.
5,Pretty good but not recommended if you have >2 people in your household,"It doesn't light up when you pop the door open. That's my only complain. Overall, recommended."
1,not satified,"worst product ever purchased would never do again, bad heating problems, you have to heat frozen food twice some times three, would not recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,IT'S SMALL...BUT A GOOD MICROWAVE!,"Hi, My old microwave went off and had about 10 years of service with an every day ware, so that was good anyway. I bought this one, just to get by until we move to Miami FL on April next year 2010. A friend of mine, will buy it from me plus most of my furniture.This one is OK for what we need to warm up so far. The one we had before was bigger and had more power too, but I will buy a good one when I get to Miami next timeI recommed the Sharp Products because of the famous life and good reputation the products have. So that's it!We like it very much, so far is doing a great job!"
2,Inconvenient control panel,"I was in a hurry and Amazon offered 2 day free shipping on this microwave, and I admit I didn't research this one enough. There is not much I like about this model, the control panel is very inconvenient. The start button is small and positioned between other options. The interior capacity is also small. I now know I could have purchased a model that would better suit my need, at a better price. I will probably give it away."
2,Sharp R-230KW 800-Watt 4/5 Cubic-Foot Compact Microwave,The Sharp microwave was reasonably priced and arrived just as promised. The packaging was extremely poor and I was elated to discover the microwave was not destroyed during transit because the box it was shipped in was.
1,"Returned Merchandise sent as ""NEW""","I give this One Star because it came from ""Amazon Returns"" in a broken boxSOOO yes I didn't even bother to open it.This is the second product (the first was a lamp that I returned twice only to get stuck with a defective on the third try) that I have purchased a new product that came straight from Amazon returns.Customer service says that should not happenbut it is happening to me!!!!anyone else???"
3,Microwave,I gave this microwave to my mom for a gift. She loved it until the second month when the digital display buttons broke. Luckily it was under warranty but she still had to lug the microwave to a dealer to fix it.
4,Good smaller microwave,"A lot of reviewers have been disappointed with this microwave so I'd like to add my perspective. I needed a small microwave for the second home and looked at every 0.8 cu ft one I could find in the stores. This Sharp was the best made, making it the clear winner in its size class. In use, it has the fairly intuitive Sharp interface, heats decently at 800 watts and has performed well for for reheating, defrosting, warming plates, and other simple tasks. The only negative is that due to the light weight of the smaller size, the rotating tray comes off the track if I slide things in or out. Comparing this microwave to my GE over the stove microwave is like comparing a KIA to a BMW. The 0.8 cu ft Sharp does the job, but I don't expect it to be as well made or as much a pleasure to use as the one I paid 8X as much for."
3,Works well but has design flaws,"We needed a small microwave to fit in a specific area. There aren't may choices out there that had good customer ratings. This unit replaced a GE which was 10 years old, and a far better overall design, but no longer available. This unit functions ok, although not very powerful. The big complain is that they put it on four hard plastic feet, so even the slightest key press, or even worse trying to open the door, it slides across the counter. Even pushing it up against a wall doesn't solve it because the back panel is irregular and pushing the door open button causes it to slide back on the right side. The designers of this unit could have not possible every used it."
4,Nice,"I purchased this microwave for my boyfriend. He uses it mainly to heat up snacks. So far, it's working very well. It is a perfect size for a smaller kitchen and the black looks great.Amazon shipping was free and fast!!"
2,it technically works...,"Expect it to take twice as long as you think. i had a 1,000 watt that i replaced with this, and it's a BIG difference."
1,An under powered microwaive,"The unit looks very good, but that is where it ends. The cavity is undersized top to bottom. One can't fit a large cup of store bought coffee into the unit to rewarm it.The cooking process is very slow too. You are better off paying a little more and getting a bigger and stronger unit."
2,Door Opens - Clunky & Loud,"I am not fond of this particular microwave because of the loud clunky sound of the door opening. Poor in my opinion. I can't believe that I will probably put up with this for years as I use my microwave several times a day. My husband just complained that the start button is hidden on the user display among the other buttons. Seems like there should some sort of user standards for display input. Like Power buttons in the upper left corner. Most-used buttons should be large. maybe in a special color. I like the web 2.0 look that is developing on user interfaces. No user interface should make the user feel stupid is my thought. I asked my husband what was the brand name and he said ""Sharp"" so even if cheap I think Sharp ought to protect the brand image. But I see that I am in the minority of opinions here. Maybe my advice is not order on line till you try this item out."
4,Perfect for the office!,"I recently moved into an office and needed a small microwave to reheat my meals and cook popcorn. Needless to say this product suits my needs completely!Besides doing the standard reheating of my lunch that I bring, it cooks popcorn perfectly with the short cut button (one of BIGGEST pet peeves is the burned popcorn due to inaccurate popcorn settings!)Conclusion: If you are looking for a great microwave for your dorm room or office, this is a great product, but if you want it for more heavy duty cooking for your home, then I'd probably look for something that's a little bigger and powerful"
3,"flimsy door, sensitive latch","I originally looked at the white version of this model, and quite a few of the reviews said that their microwave arrived and would not function. I decided to take my chances and get a black one. When it arrived I was afraid I had gambled and lost, because it would accept a cooking time but we could never get it to start. Today I discovered that if you make sure the top and bottom latches are locked, and then press down on the door so that it is lined up with the body exactly, it will start.I'm sure that the shielding is sufficient so that when the door is fully latched, the radiation is kept to a minimum, even if the plastic components allow for a little bit of give in the up and down direction. The motor of ours doesn't seem especially noisy, and for us it is the perfect balance of a small exterior and a sufficiently large interior. Once I get used to the ritual necessary for starting it, I believe I'll be quite happy with it."
2,not what they said,"I read the review for the Sharp and a few said that the light did not stay on when the door opened. I called the Sharp company, and they say it did, lights stay on as soon as the door is opened, on and after. That was a blatant lie. The light is on when you push on only. When you close the door, it closes with a loud ""bam"", no matter when pushed gently or just closed, so I just leave it open til I need to use it again. That crowds the counter space. The see-through window is awkward to see through, probably design fault. I would not recommend buying this particulr model."
3,"Well, I'm not as happy as I should be. The clock light does not","Well, I'm not as happy with this microwave as I should be. The clock light does notwork,and the door is very loud when I close it. I'm surprised that the name ""Sharp""would come out with this kind of a product. I guess they are all just out for thebuck. Years ago when you bought something you would take it home you would surprisedif it didn't work. Now your surprised if it does. Sincerely, Sandy gertie02@comcast.net."
1,Spontaneously Shuts Off After a Few Seconds,"After a couple of weeks (and after I already tossed the box) this microwave spontaneously shuts off after a few seconds. Nothing in the owners manual addressed this, so I searched online for posts on the same issue and found them. Now I feel duped and stupid. Spend the extra dough and get a good microwave. This one sucks."
2,Beware of extremely poor packaging,The first box has been delivered by UPS damaged during transportation. Replacement has arrived by Fedex damaged (a little bit less) again. This item ships in manufacture packaging which is extremely poor packaged. The microwave body is made of extremely thin material so do not wonder if you receive it damaged.
4,Nearly perfect,"I reserved a star simply for the one thing that I found wrong with this otherwise perfect microwave...the turntable noise. When we first got it, I nearly packaged it back up because the turntable was incredibly loud. Now that we have used it a few months, the noise is gone. Went from a giant microwave to this smaller version and don't know why we had a big one in the first place! I like the fact that the light on this microwave comes on only when cooking. I also really like the small size, the light weight of the machine, and the sleek design. I purchased this microwave based on other reader's reviews and the fact that there is a bank of about 30 at work. These little guys at work take a serious beating and, other than a few of the turntables not working, heat very well. The ones at work are a few years old now, too.I do not regret this decision in the least!!"
4,VERY quiet if positioned just right,"Quieter than the previous two microwaves we've owned. But we had to position it just right so it wouldn't make a vibrating noise. ""Start"" and ""Clear"" buttons should be designated better. But all the buttons on the panel are very responsive and work well. It seems to be well built, and we are very satisfied with it overall."
3,LED needs some work,"Microwave works fine so far and is simple to use. Only complaint is that the LED is very hard to read and if you are over 5 feet tall, you have to bend over to see the LED. Surely Sharp can do better on this."
1,Very Weak Power,"This is a very sub-par microwave. The power produced by this unit is absolutely terrible. Every item that goes into the microwave must be cooked longer, and is never cooked uniformly throughout. Do not waste your money on this product."
1,won't turn off!,"I had bought an earlier version of this model which worked perfectly for 10 years until the on button stopped working. I had been so pleased with that microwave that I bought this one without even checking the reviews. After 9 months the microwave stopped turning off after the timer bell rang. The cancel button doesn't work do I have to unplug it. I am trying to reach the nearest service center which is 20 minutes away, but they don't pick up their phone. Skip this one."
3,Sharp Microwave adequate for limited needs and price,Limited size kitchen accomodates this microwave. Size was deciding factor. I don't use it for anything fancy.
4,A great basic microwave,"This a very good basic microwave. It does what it's supposed to do: reheat leftovers, make popcorn, warm a pie. It does it simply - nothing complicated or over-techno. It looks perfectly acceptable on the counter and it isn't overpriced. That's what we were looking for as a replacement for our old microwave when it died and that's what we got. Good value."
4,Good deal!,"We bought our original Sharp microwave in 2001, and it finally gave out just a couple of weeks ago. Having a relatively inexpensive appliance last for 9 years is quite impressive, so we knew we wanted to replace it with another Sharp.I have to admit that the new model does not seem to be as well made as the old one--but that's true of just about anything you buy nowadaysBut what matters is the working parts, and hopefully the quality is still there."
2,arrived DOA,"I give this a 2 star because i like the size, price and everything was good except it arrive dead.sadly this seems to be common with microwaves up into the $100+ trend, so i just bought a different similar price/size model at a local chain store.what i got was a proctor-silex.there is something i don't like about this microwave, this has a black/grey display. the proctor-silex has a green/black which is easier to see."
1,MICRO WITH NON ILLUMINATED CLOCK & CAROUSEL,"THIS MICRO-WAVE HAS A CLOCK THAT'S NOT ILLUMINATED, AND THE CAROUSELLIGHT DOESN'T GO ON WHEN OPENING THE DOOR !!!! ONLY ON WHILE MICROIS ACTUALLY TURNING, THEN SHUTS OFF BEFORE YOU TAKE IT OUT OF THEOVEN..I HAD TO PUT THIS MICRO NEAR THE SUNLIGHT, BUT AT NIGHT EVENWITH MY KITCHEN LIGHTS ON YOU MUST STAND NO FURTHER THAN 2 FEET AWAYTO VIEW CLOCK CLEARLY. (I HAVE 20/20 VISION). I FIND IT ABSURD THATSOMEONE WOULD EVEN MANUFACTURE A MICRO-WAVE WITHOUT THESE TWO MOSTIMPORTANT FEATURES..OBVIOUSLY I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASINGTHIS ITEM."
5,Great little microwave...,...bought it for the office. Amazon delivered it in a jiffy. It works nicely and would recommend it to anyone interested in a compact microwave.
2,"OK machine, but -----",I had bad luck with this. It made strange noises and died almost exactly one week after the warranty expired. I suppose that happens occasionally. I bought a new microwave -- also from Amazon -- but switched to a different manufacturer.
1,Failed after 6 months,"My family's original Sharp microwave from the 80s lasted forever, so I though it'd be a safe bet to go with another Sharp. Well, it's obvious that these newer models are not manufactured to the same level of quality as the original Sharp microwaves that most of us know and love. After 6 months, the clock started to fade, and the whole right column of the control panel, which includes the cook, 1-minute cook, etc stopped working.I've resorted to using the ""Popcorn"" button, since that's at least still a one-touch cook. Otherwise, it's just an oversized paperweight. Very disappointed with this product."
2,Worked - for 6 months,"I bought this in April, it arrived at the end of April and it started its death spiral in November. Its death spiral started with odd electrical smells, intermittent problems with it not working (the light would come on, the timer would work, the turntable would spin, etc. but it just would NOT cook or it might for maybe a minute or two then quit). By December it just was not working at all. At this price, I didn't expect it to last forever, like say the one my Mom bought in the 80's that lasted a decade or so. However, I did expect it to easily last at least a full year. Run, do not walk, away from this product. Save your money."
1,Buy another microwave.,"Bought this microwave in April. It's now broken. Bad smell then it stopped working. Simple as that. Last microwave we had lasted at least a decade not 7 months. Moreover, as a test I also bought a SquareTrade warranty. Useless. Because the microwave lasted less than a year it's still covered by the manufacturers warranty which, it turns out, is SquareTrades virtual deductible."
4,"""More than adequate for the price""","I was downsizing when I purchased this microwave--both in size and in heat content. My biggest satisfaction with this product was that it fit the small space that had been created in my kitchen cabinet design for a microwave. My second goal had been to have an all-white product, which is hard to find in today's black or stainless appliance kitchens. I have no complaints about the heating quality or the control choices. My only reminder of a lesser-product is that the door makes the sound a metal door will make, when it is opened or closed. But this product is more than adequate for the price."
2,Not a Great Design,"I purchased this after having another Sharp thatwas bigger, but lasted many years. To make thisone so inexpensive, Sharp has really gone downhill in my mind. The dim touch pad is poorly designedand certainly NOT much of an engineering marvel.Just how hard would it be to make the most usedtouch buttons to stand out? (Like START or STOP beingbigger than the numbered buttons on this touch pad?)C'mon Sharp--you can do much better!"
3,"Noisy, little microwave-that-could","I bought this micro solely based on size, as it needed to fit inside a cabinet. and I was replacing a Sharp micro that had been good to me for many years. This little thing makes an inordiinate amount of noise while running, like it's trying really, really hard. Takes about 50% longer to do the same job, as well. It's certainly adequate if you only microwave the occasional item, but if you're a more heavy duty microwave user, I would suggest you look elsewhere."
1,"Not that great, No display light for Timer/Clock","I was very happy to see the look & compact microwave from Sharp, but it didn't work for me :-(* As soon I started, I have found that there is no back light display for Timer/Clock which is quite common for any Mocrowave.* And also it doesn't have good hold/support for the tray as it makes some rattling noise when we try to use bigger boxes to heat.* Not worth for 70$, I have seen my friends using 30$ microwave with better results."
1,Very disappointing,"From the start, the unit I received made an awful noise when you tried to use it. Although I was able to return it for full credit without too much trouble, I would have preferred an exchange to see if another unit worked correctly."
1,do not buy,"Ordered one from Amazon. It comes very quick. It only last a few second every time it turned on. EXCHANGED. The second one ccame very fast too. However, it only worked for ten days with less than an hour of total usage. Will get a different brand from AMAZON."
3,"Good, Bad, but not Ugly","I've used this microwave for 2 1/2 years now.I see the Amazon price has increased.Several things I don't like about it.* If the controls are below eye-level, it's hard to manage. I end up hitting the START button for a one-minute exposure most times. I find the details of cooking foods in this microwave too boring and complex.*Generally, I detest the ""touch"" controls. Over time, the labels get more difficult to read, etc.* The plate doesn't seat real securely on its tray.The good point is it's still working.(Next time, I will probably pick one up at Walmart.)"
4,Works great,"In today's day and age, microwave is a very low-tech product. It's really a very simple technology and performs very simple functions.With that in mind, Sharp R-230 KK works just fine. Does excactly what it is supposed to do, and does it w/o any problems. The buttons are easy to use and manage. The black color I got would blend with most styles of kitchen."
4,Does The Job,"We needed a smaller microwave that sucked up less power otherwise we'd have to upgrade the electrical system in the kitchen. This does the trick. No more blown fuses and it gets the job done. Reheating coffee takes a bit longer (60 seconds before, 90 seconds now) but it was an easy tradeoff for more counterspace and no trips to the breaker box. This is a simple, no frills microwave. Excellent value."
5,Great little Microwave,I have no problems with this little microwave. I put a red/green sticker on the off/on buttons so I could see them clearly/faster. It heats foods/drinks fast. Love it!
5,So far so good,"This was the best reviewed compact microwave that i could find. We were looking for one that would fit into our microwave wall cabinet and this one fit the bill. Make sure you do have about 13 1/2"" depth to your shelf as you need that for the feet of the microwafe to go on."
4,Cooking with a microwave,Excellant product. Good controls for cooking and reheating. Plastic cover over the control buttons wrinkled and has small ridges in it.
4,Does its job nicely,"I've had good luck with Sharp compact microwaves, as this is the second one I've owned (I left the first one in my old apartment with my roommate). It is the perfect size for my small New York City kitchen. I chose this model over others because it is small enough to fit on my counter yet large enough to hold a normal sized dinner plate, unlike some of the other compact microwaves I've seen."
2,Very Diappointed,"This item was described on Amazon website as new, but had a dent on the top part when it arrived. This microwave is too small and very difficult to open the lid without holding the microwave. There is no light on the clock area and is therefore dark to see the time when the kitchen light is switched off. I owned a bigger Sharp R-23 wat microwave, but was disappointed with this one. I am thinking about buying a new microvawe."
1,BEWARE!!!! Buttons will stop working.,"It did the job til it became defective. After a year of light use (avg 3 times a week), three of the most important buttons stopped working: the start button, power level button and minute plus button. Now the only way we can get it to heat anything is to use the popcorn button."
4,Does it's job well!,"I am the sole user of the microwave, use it several times a day, and mostly for heating....rarely for cooking. I find that this microwave heats evenly & quickly, is a perfect size for my needs (not overbearing & bulky, not too tiny for larger meals/dishes), and has been working well for two years.All of the buttons still work, the glass dish is still whole & rotating perfectly, the lever to open the door still functions smoothly, and it remains quiver free during operation....it does not shake or make any weird noises while it's heating my food.The microwave could be improved if the interior light came on when you opened the door...the inside is lit only while the device is heating. Other than that, I have no complaints!"
4,Sturdy and Reliable,"This is a great utility microwave. I've only had mine for a couple of months, but it does all the basics that I bought it for: reheating and making popcorn.It was a good deal for the price and it actually looks nice.It's surprisingly quiet."
1,Piece of JUNK. Broke after 4 months barely using it 3 minutes a day to warm up milk,"This microwave stopped working yesterday, after just 4 months since purchase. I used it very little, just to warm up milk, 3 minutes in the morning. I suppose it is the front panel that seems not to be fully attached to the body of the microwave so it is probably a matter of electrical contacts in the front panel. I contacted Sharp, well of course there is no way whatsoever to talk to a human. You get the closest locations (which for me are all over 100 miles distance) and I guess if you want to ship it, then ship at your own expenses (that would cost at least 25 $ because on the website they also say you must insure the shipping).Total WASTE of 70$. Very disappointed. I will NOT buy any more Sharp microwaves ever again"
1,"Broke, same problem as others had","After three weeks it just stopped working -- would turn on for three seconds than just shut down.I've visited Sharp's web site in search for a local service center (I'm in Baltimore), and their web site just gave back a 1-800 number, so I guess they don't have any service center around here. Decided to return it.A major disappointment. Please consider something more durable even if more expensive."
1,Broke after 3months,"I bought this for my sister's new place as a housewarming gift. Sadly it broke.Would I buy another one? Yes, but not this one or from this brand -- ever again!"
2,Number buttons no longer work after less than 2 years,"Used to have a Sharp micorwave which lasted for years before the rotating table stopped turning. Bought this version which was more tedious to program: to get a 10% setting you need to press the power level 10 times. Now, after less than 2 years the number buttons are, one by one, no longer responding."
4,Replacement microwave,"This Sharp was purchased to replace a 700 watt microwave which had lasted ""forever"". Only time will tell if the Sharp will give as good a service. The touch-pad controls are not very user friendly and the door has a cheap feel when operated. But the unit works well and the compact size is nice."
4,SHARP 0.8 MICROWAVE,"Our old Sharp .7 cubic foot microwave failed, and we wanted a replacement. We liked the original, so an exact replacement would do, but was not available. The orignal was not too big, but had a square interior so we could put in larger bowls. Many of the microwaves out there do not have square interiors, so you are limited to the bowl size. Why the interior would not be square is beyond me, perhaps just to up the cubic feet. Anyway, after much serching we found this one and it is just about as large as our previous .7 cubic feet unit (we can put in the same size bowls-almost). I liked the controls on our old unit better, but perhaps only because I was used to them. In conclusion, I like this unit because the inside is square - that maximizes the size of the bowl that you can put in. No problems with the operation."
3,Worked well until it broke,"Bought it September 2009 because of the good reviews on Amazon. Have used mainly for heating leftover food, and sometimes making popcorn. Since November 2010, the start button is no longer working properly - only responding once in a while. And the start button stopped working completely on Christmas day!"
3,Sharp R-230KK Compact Microwave,The microwave came as advertised. It worked fine at first but just quit after two weeks. It was replaced very quickly and the replacement has been working just fine. Very nice unit for the price.
4,"not the Andrews Sisters, the other group","Before the Andrews Sisters, the Boswell Sisters were on the radio, singing with Bing Crosby (as the Andrewses would later do), recording their versions of ""Dinah"", ""Shine On Harvest Moon"", ""When It's Sleepy Time Down South"",to name just a few, and becoming extremely popular. The Andrews Sisters admitted completely to copying them, ""so much we sounded like shrimp trawlers"". The Boswells (from New Orleans) swing like no other group before or since (unless said group copies off an arrangement). Their tempo changes, their whole treatment of songs is unique and if close harmony pop is your thing you better check them out."
3,The Boswell Sisters Cut Loose!,"Great selection of Boswell Sisters Harmony! Nice packaging...Trouble is, some of the material has not be ""digitally cleaned""So half the tracks have background scratchy noise... Guess thatsthe price you pay for music that is 80 years old! Still, its funto hear their unique brand of harmony... Great for music historians..."
2,Very Weak Book,"This is a weak Arts & Crafts furniture book. Many of the plans are simple and pseudo ""Arts & Crafts"" pieces (a CD holder?). There are a couple of nice plans, but that's it.The drawings look like they are from a budget CAD program, but that aside are quite detailed and informative.I would recommend looking at another book, such as ""Classic Arts & Crafts Furniture You Can Build"" by Andy Schultz or ""The Furniture of Gustav Stickley : History, Techniques, Projects"". Those are two really nice books, with excellent plans."
2,Weak plans,"I have three Stickley furniture plans books and this is the weakest of them. Several of the plans are not truely ""Stickley"" furniture, but more ""sort of like arts & crafts style"".I'd recommend looking at another book. ""The Furniture of Gustav Stickley"", is _much_ better."
4,Dont be too critical!,"For all you critics out there who have not written books but have instead just commented on them without really thinking about why they were written the way they are here is a second thought. Books are all different and some are good and bad, this book does not show to be any less quality and actually has some really nice drawings which are very helpful compared to those who have none at all. These peices of furnature range from a cd rack which is very useful around our house to a near-by coffee table that lies in our living room now. This book instructs those who want to learn some fairly easy projects that progress in difficulty even if you have the right tools. Why not have the something decorative and useful such as the cd-rack in this book?"
5,"The Best ""Gouldberg Variations""?","So what did I need with yet another interpretation by Glenn Gould of this work? Yep, I could've lived without it, I guess, but I'm glad I didn't. Despite the sound quality (which, considering the source, isn't really that bad), this performance has become my favorite one over the '55 and '81 versions. It isn't as showy as the '55, nor is it as eccentric as the '81. Gould's playing is technically brilliant here, but not forced in it's display. He is more relaxed and not trying to impress. One gets the idea that he is playing ""for himself"", and I like that. Gouldomaniacs are probably familiar with this 1954 record, and it would be a good record for those who've never heard this Bach masterpiece. Buy it."
2,"Very fine performance, hideous recording","Nearly unlistenable. Very fine performance, hideous recording; Zero dynamic range, noise from hall, etc. Either was not remastered properly or the original master tapes were bad to begin with. Not kidding here, but It sounds about as good as a cassette tape recorded on a boom box to me. Sad, because Gould did perform very well."
4,Japanese Rock Power,"While there are some weaker moments, mainly during the covers ( House of the Rising Sun, and 20th Century Schizoid Man) this band wails.And I agree with a previous reviewer - SATORI is the better album - heavier, with with some more realized musicianship.But this is a classic, if only for the cover photo, which reveals a little more of the band than most would like to see!These folks were into their art, and their lifestyle, and as sincere as it gets (variously colored perm wiggy hair aside!).A generous time capsule from a period long gone, and hard to be surprised by for our jaded ears and cynical minds.great stuff"
3,Great cover,"You have to get this one for the cover, not the music, whcih is not bad but the band have done better (Satori)."
5,great math & ancient fun game,"My daughter, a high school math teacher, had wanted this game for a long time.I was glad to be able to get it for her.It was backordered for quite a while, I almost cancelled the order but then it was available just before I gave up."
3,great look but be careful what size hole you cut for them,"We bought these to use in our built-in desk. We order these and cut our holes to 2"", but found these are slightly too loose. They look ok, but the base piece spins rather than sitting snugly."
1,Would you believe a wading pool?,"I have to admit, this is the first one of this series I have been seriously disappointed in. No finesse at all. Sounds like water being slowly sloshed around in a big plastic tub, with some birds thrown in now and then. Sounds like someone made it in their backyard with a childs' wading pool."
2,"Thin, and magnets are a mystery","I got it because it was cheap. I got what I paid for. I have no idea what the magnets said to be inside are for and it doesn't bother explaining it in the packaging. It's basically cheap foam on a cardboard backing with a thin cover. It does cushion a little, but it's not something most folks would rave about. Other than covering a hole in a worn out car seat, I'm not sure what the purpose of it is. It does have a pretty good system for strapping it to the seat, with 3 sets of connectors."
4,Does the job,I needed just a little cushion and this does the job. The top part kept drooping until I moved the elastic up as there is no interior wire to keep it stiff.
3,Thin but good,"I got this for my father because his clothe seat in his SUV was mildly ripped and because of his weight, he feels like he sits on the springs. For some reason (lack of investigating on my part), I thought this seat came like the black and grey picture so I thought it was going to be thick. The product is only the thin black piece, so that presumption was my fault. Just want you to learn from my mistake. Still mostly happy with the product."
4,A different side of Seattle,"It was a early Saturday morning in April of 1992. I was on a camping trip in Point Pleasant, PA. I was listening to a rock station in Allentown, and I heard something for the first time that sounded like a country and western song, but then it began thrashing the heebie jeebies out of me, and I ran over to CRANK IT UP!!!!!! I would find out later it was a group named War Babies, and the song was called ""Sweetwater"". I'd also go onto find out that they were from Seattle WA. I was mindblown again as the groups coming out of Seattle at the time were Grunge like Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and Alice In Chains. War Babies sounded more like a bluesey group, and didn't fit into the picture. I'd be cranking it at high volume in my car at all times. Unfortunately, they only released one single called ""Hang Her Up"", and disappeared. ""Sweetwater"" wound up going to #2 on my heavy metal/hard rock poll for 1992. ""Alive"" from Pearl Jam took the top spot."
2,Too opinionated for it's own good,"While the subject matter is excellent, the authours opinion is too prevalent.JD Cardwell considers all sailboats under 22' as ""not really cruisers"". There are many on the water that would disagree. While a bigger trailerable may be more comfortable, it's also harder to tow, and more expensive.The authour needlessly runs the risk of pushing the dream beyond the scope of those with limited resources.This book may be considered valuable by those with or considering boats between 22 to 26 feet, but probably not to others.Lastly, the authour obviously places more importance on creature comfort than seaworthiness, O.K. for the marina crowd, but offensive to the true cruising sailor."
3,Does it come with a mast?,"This book is a nice feature survey book of typical trailerables that I found useful as a dinghy owner looking to upgrade. It gives some sound specific recommendations: get a stainless steel swimming ladder so you can climb in when exhausted from working on the boat.I think the author keeps his boat at the marina though, because it's missing a couple of key topics: 1) what does it take to pull these boats (engine power, launching) and 2)how about raising the mast - do you need three people? Some sort of rig?Also missing is any real discussion of how do these boats handle in a knockdown/capsize."
2,too narrow,"For me this book was useful only in that it pointed out to me that there is such a thing as trailer sailing. All well and good. However I rapidly(less than a week) out grew the book's very narrow scope, and now have no use for it. Would even hesitate to give to a friend because all the boats he recommends are pretty heavy, hence require a reasonably powerful vehicle to tow. No where does he even acknowledge that there is a relationship between displacement and tow vehicle size. Most of us can't go buy a dedicated towing machine."
3,I wish...,"I wish that they had written about more boats...The categories discussed in the book are all fine, and if this is the only book you are buying it is very well written, but more discussion of actual boats that fit the bill would have been more instructive as to the pluses and minuses of each individual boat.Otherwise, a nice update."
4,This CD is not Enhanced With Music...,"...there is another title from the same collection called A Walk in Deeps Woods, which is enhanced with music, but this one is not enhanced, just good old nature sounds."
5,"what the heck, amazon?",I can't believe that the name of this incredible cellist does not appear on this recording's title on amazon until you look at the details! It's a cd of CELLO SONATAS! Desmond Hoebig is BIG!
5,Butterfly Pring Silf Scarf,The scarf was very high quality and was as pictured.The manufacturer personally delivered this to my home the next day(they were in an area close to my home) when I emailed them aftermy purchase that I needed to expedite this scarf for a funeral.
4,It's good,"I found the strongest part of the book was the early years - growing up in Brooklyn, and the determination to build an acting career. I was surprised that it was almost a revelation to Barbra that she might make a career out of singing, undertaken in order to keep the wolves from the door. I'm not an obsessive fan by any means but I found this book about a woman who is such an icon a good and meaty read. I kind of admnire her ""obsessive"" single-mindednessto achieve what she wants in her art. Not a hagiography, but a respectful look at an interesting and complex woman."
3,"Meticulous, But Less Than Gripping","This history of Shanghai during WWII is amazingly researched (check the notes), and beautifully written, and yet somehow failed to be quite as fascinating as I'd anticipated. There are bizarre personalities, intrigues, and dastardly deeds by the handful, but there's a lot of history of fairly boring bureaucratic maneuvering as well. Shanghai was certainly interesting in the variety of interests and intelligence groups operating in it, but in the end one gets the feeling that a great deal of time and effort was expended on all sides to virtually no effect. I think the book possibly suffers from the lack of a single major dramatic incident. Of course, this is history, so it is what it is, but it rather peters out, I felt. Still, of considerable interest to WWII or Chinese history buffs."
4,Successful study guide,This study guide is an excellent feature of an outstanding survey course of the History of Western Traditions. I have been using the course and this study guide with my high school classes (Home Schoolers) for over 10 years.
5,One of the best,"This is one of my all time favorites, and one of Arturo's best ever. I've been playing trumpet for over 9 years, and For Love or Country is an awesome CD [and DVD] with techniques and notes far beyond most musician's capabilities.Manteca is an awesome version of Gillespie and Pozo's be-bop masterpiece. Track 2 (The Man I Love) was arranged by the Cuban Orchestra's director specifically FOR Arturo when he was in Cuba. He then plotted this AWESOME song on this soundtrack. ""Marianela"" is a beautiful tune which he WROTE for his wife, Marianela, and is what he calls the best song he's ever written. Every song has great significance, which can only be topped by the musical brilliance of the CD."
1,"Buy the Best of Aturo Sandoval, not this",I loved this movie. The soundtrack is very dissapointing. Many of the songs sound alike and they are less than 60 seconds long. When I bought this C.D. I also bought the Best of Arturo Sandoval and a C.D. by Jesus Alemany. These two C.D.'s are fantastic and I would recommend them with 5 stars!
1,"For Love or Country, The Soundtrack","Do Not Buy This Album thinking you are going to hear the music presented on its ""'click here to listen"" button. That music is very beautiful and clearly above any of the things you will hear on the album. I hold this against Mr. Sandoval personally for not knowing what his people are posting on his site. I feel this has been done on purpose to promote this very unexceptional album. It is deceit, plain and simple."
1,Disapointing,"The movie is great but the cd is bad! The track ""The man i love"" and ""Canta trompeta querida"" is two great songs where Mr Sandoval plays great! ""Guantanamera"" is also a great song but Mr Sandoval plays really bad here! I am a big Arturo Sandoval fan and own all of his records so i know he can play much better than this! Buy his new L.A. Meetings before this one,don`t waist your money!"
4,Totally Male - Totally Swell!,"I bought this CD primarily for ""This Little Girl"" and ""Donna the Primadonna"" but the entire CD is a great surprise! I always liked ""This Little Girl"" when I was in junior high and the male grunting chorus behind Dion was, and is, primal and swell!"
5,DION'S GREATEST HITS,"This is an awesome CD but is missing the WANDERER however it grows on you and one cannot stop hearing it. It is a ""feel good"" CD with mostly up tempo music and it makes you want to dance. I have learned all the lyrics and sing to it quite often - everyone who listens to it loves it and asks who is it? Where did you purchase it from? Buy your own - it will knock your socks off - man, what a CD - BUY IT!"
3,wish it was a board book,I thought it would be sturdier. the pages are double sided paper. I got this for my little on since she loves books she can stick her fingers through any holes. But I fear she will ruin this pretty quick.
5,My Son's Favorite Book,"My son started with Five Little Ladybugs when he was only a few months old. We read it over and over and over again until Daddy discovered TEN Little Ladybugs! (He's obviously not the one home reading to his son all day.) Anyway, whether 5 or 10 ladybugs, they are both my son's favorite books. He's learned how to point and touch, turn the pages and associate similar colors. It really is a sweet book, as long as you can stand reading it again and again. Of course, my son is worth it!"
5,It's a winner,"This is my 7-month-old daughter's favorite book. It has great big, colorful pictures and it rhymes. She loves to see the ladybugs disappear and she looks for them by turning the pages back and forth. I'm always looking for books just like this one. I'm surprised that it is rated for older babies."
3,"story is ok, a little strange","The story is not what I expected -- each page introduces a new animal, and the reader is led to think that the animals are eating the lady bugs and that is why they are disappearing. But the very last page the reader finds out that they were not eaten but rather all taken to a party together."
4,Fun and educational!,"My daughter loves the sing song patter I can achieve with the rhyme of this book. She also loves ladybugs, so this was a no-brainer. When I first read this, I was a bit anxious as to just where exactly all the little ladybugs were going to. But fear not, it all ends well."
5,My daughter LOVES this book,"This book is the reason my daughter fell in love with story time. When my daughter was about 6 months old I began reading this book periodically but when she was around 8 or 9 months old she just began LOVING it. She would constantly bring it to me and as I would turn the page to count down one more number she would squeal in excitement. I now have the book memorized and can ""read"" it from across the room as she holds it and turns the pages. I have recommended this book to every parent I know especially ones with daughters and they have all had success. My daughter is now almost 17 months old and still loves and enjoys every time we read ""Ten Little Ladybugs"" NO REGRETS"
3,Ten Little Ladybugs,"This book was an excellent choice to share with preschoolers. The vivid illustrations and ladybugs on the pages attract children immediately. The story has a very predictable pattern that young children can memorize and retell. We have read it many, many times!"
3,O.k. book,"This book is great for kids. But as an adult I have the ability to compare it with other books like this. For example ""10 little Butterflies"". 10 Little Butterflies is much better. The rhymes in ""Ladybugs"" are stunted, lacking rhythm frequently. But then again, my kid can't read. Illustrations are good and my kid likes to play with the little bugs and holes in pages.Buy it, it's fine for your child. But you, me and Melanie Gerth know she didn't bring her ""A"" game to this one...."
5,My daughter absolutely loves this book!!,My daughter have me to read this book again and again and again... She is 20 months old now. The book fell apart because she played and fliped the pages so much. It is such a nice book that you can count the bugs or teach the baby to identify different things in the book. The colors are bright that really attract my little one's attention. I really enjoy reading this book with my daughter.
5,My 11 month old just loves this book!,"I keep finding my 11 month old pulling this book to the floor and looking at the pages. When it is read to him he knows the close it at the end and then fusses if you don't read it again! It is my favorite of all of his current books, so I am glad that it is his favorite, too. I am probably going to be very tired of it soon because we read it a few times in a row each day - per his ""request"". But it is a darling book and would make a really neat present if you are looking for a good idea. We received our copy as a gift from a thoughtful neighbor and I am sure glad that we did!"
5,A Must Have...,"As a Child Development Specialist I understand the importance of reading to infants - so you can imagine my disappointment when my baby had an active resentment to my attempts to ""read"" to her.Suddenly (like a light switch), at 13 months, my daughter became completely enamored with books. Ten Little Ladybugs is her absolute favorite... and we read it 5-7 times EVERY day. She pulls it out from the coffee table and crawls into my lap for story time. Both the writing and illustrations are magnificent.Reading this book to my daughter is such a fun experience that I truly believe every child should be fortunate enough to have that important grown-up in their life share this magical book with them.I now give this book as gifts to all baby and grandparent showers I attend."
5,The best!,"I let my then 5 month old daughter choose a book from a local toy store and this is what she grabbed right away. She is almost 8 months now and every day she crawls over to her little bookshelf and pulls out Ten Little Ladybugs. She has quite a library of books, but nothing excites her more than the colorful drawings and 3-D ladybugs. Whether or not she learns to count backwards would just be icing on the cake - buy this book for the colors, rhyming and durability. (And the ladybugs get home in the end!) Well worth the price."
4,"Fun, but simple","While this book was used and not in the best shape, it is full of color and the kids love the little ladybugs! It is very simply worded with one sentence across the bottom of the page. So, the ladybugs are the main attraction."
4,Good counting book,It's a good counting book with beautiful illustrations and the little ladybugs stuck to the pages. My son's complaint with it is that the ladybugs don't do anything. They're just there for their texture / shape.
2,"cute but overrated, overpriced and contains very little substance",I bought this flashy book from reading from all these rave reviews. The cute and flashy book could only keep my fifteen months old interested for barely ten minutes. There isn't much to read except sensing little lady bugs. My daughter prefers reading Sandra Boyton's books. I will return this book.
1,I hate this book,"I really do hate this book. The plot makes no sense. How does a fish interact with ladybugs? Yeah, I get the point that it's supposed to teach counting, but the story itself is inane."
5,Warm and Wonderful,"This is truly a great CD. It is Christian Country at its finest! My whole family, aged 39 years down to 5 years loves the music Randy Travis is singing and performing - his voice is fantastic! Some songs are more quiet and some are sing outloud right there in the car or where ever!! Amazing Grace is so sweet. There is no doubt that Randy Travis believes in his music and it sure is evident here. Highly Recommend this CD if you want to listen to something real and uplifting."
5,Amazing but proprietary,"I own Minolta DiMAGE 7i and I've found this is the most usefull accessory I have. It's amazing how this flash can improve your camera functionality. Really high (>180) guide number, virtually no limit on sync shutter speed (1/12000 sec!), fully supported TTL metering. Plus because it uses wireless channel to communicate with your camera, it very easy to point fill-in light. Just hold the flash in your hand or ask someone for help and no need to worry about cables or settings - TTL and wireless make your job really easy. Actually I can't name anything I don't like.There is just one issue. It's proprietary, so it's really nice on compatible Minolta cameras and it's really ugly on everything else."
1,Very poor page yield,"I have had this cartridge for 1 month and have printed about 200 pages. It has started to have blank areas on printing, correctable (at least for now) by shaking the cartridge. In my past experience with true HP cartridges, this indicates that I've only got a relatively short time left. It's almost as if the cartridge was not properly filled. Once it dies, I'm going back to HP. It was worth a try."
1,Jams up my printer,"After I installed this cartridge, my HP printer (1012) printed just only one page fine and then printer has been jamming for all subsequent prints. If I use the old original HP cartridge it is ok. Waste of my money!"
4,Really inexpensive,"Works great. Every now and then, we get a page with a few extra lines. Haven't figured it out yet.But great price and product."
1,Maybe I got a lemon,"The cartridge did not fit in my printer properly and the toner began leaking out. I threw it away, and then had to throw away the small trash pail in my study, since the toner was all over the inside of it. Maybe a rare occurrence, but I wouldn't take the chance again."
2,Toner Leaks and not stands to the standard,Toner Leaks and uneven printing. Have to shake cartridge to get 2/3 pages and print quality goes downand right after that. Did not print even 500 pages when it was claiming to be high capacity toner cartridge. You caanot print in one month all those pages to find out the capacity and quality.
5,It works! I recommend it!,Nice black type. Box it shipped in was warn and I recommend that they purchase new boxes rather than re-use. I think the price could withstand the added cost. It just would give customers a more secure feeling that it will work for a long time. Packing materials were totally fine.
1,Paper jams,Installed in printer. Paper jams. Bad cartridge. Threw out. Did not contact company for replacement. Just ordered from another company.
1,"How do I return these, they do not work correctly.",These toners leave streak on the new printed copy or they squeese or eliminate some of the words. Very POOR quality!
2,Compatible HP Q2612X (AI-2612X) High-Capacity Toner Cartridge (HP 12X) for the HP LaserJet 1012/1018/1020/1022/1022N/1022NW/3050,The ink is much too light. It is not suitable for my business. I do not know if there is some way to adjust the darkneww of the ink.
3,Good price but not good quality,"Bought two of these because of the price. Actual print quality is good, but it also prints three evenly spaced small dots near the left edge on every page. I cannot use this toner for any official printing. Have not installed the second one yet and hope that is not the case with that one too."
1,"TERRIBLE Quality, Useless out of the box DO NOT BUY","This is the first and only non-OEM laser cartridge I've purchased, and the last. You get what you pay for. Actually, you don't even get what you did pay for -- the brand new cartridge was flaky, damaged, or dried out. Could not get a printout without huge white gaps, despite repeated troubleshooting.Don't expect the seller to reply -- that's why they're on Amazon.Went back to the more expensive HP cartridges, which at least last me 1-2 years without trouble."
2,HP LJ 1020 non-oem toner cartridge - black marks on right margin,"The HP LJ 1020 non-oem toner cartridge prints clearly and does not jam; however, it prints black smudges along the right margin of every page."
3,A great book,"It's a great book; however, it was not the publisher I was looking. There is only one publisher that has the ""real deal"""
1,Received wrong version!,The version I received has different contents from the Orne Publishing 2010. The contents between chapters are not included in this version from Viax Publishing. I contacted this seller and they now state they only had one version. The front hardcover is absolutely different. This seller was not polite after being contacted.
1,Godless,"I could not get past the first section. Boring and Godless. There are probably a few good action steps later in the book but I can get a lot more from other writers that recognize that God, not ""Nature"", is the source of all good things."
5,Think and Grow Rich on steroids!,"This is one of those wonderful life-companion books that will be forever at my bedside table.It is beautifully bound and typeset, and knowing that the words are direct from from the pen of Napoleon Hill gives it an uncanny presence. But it is the content that is the real kicker here. There is no ""secret"" here, this is the success teachings from which all others stem, written in superbly articulated, engaging and vivid language that feels more like the memory of a recent personal conversation than lessons of life. Don't wait, get it!"
4,The potential effectiveness of the the book in inculcating ideas for wealth creation,"The book is a valuable source of paragraphs, chapters,etc which acts as trainer to aspiring youngsters like us, how to become wealthy. Every man or women wants to become wealthy. But what I like about this book is that it trains the readers in the beginning how to prepare oneself, know oneself, one's goals, consolidate and than start climbing the mountain of wealth creation. Other good thing is that it warns not to compromise one's ethics for short term gains. In all, it is a nice guide which teaches basic rules and advices for long term wealth creation and a good book to have in one's library for future reference."
5,Buy it now,"I can't believe this book is only 12$ it has changed my entire life its worth more than gold to me. If your looking for a serious (600 pages) book on how to follow what you desire in life the most, then this book is for you. Its not just motivating but expalins through hard research of 20 years exactly how you can start and what it takes to become successfull. This book provides no shortcuts its simple hard work, faith and motivation with clear examples from the master of success philosophy Napolean Hill whose entire life is the result of these laws. Incase your wondering the author studied giants in the field of industry, finance and salesmanship like Henry Ford, Andrew Carnigie, Thomas Edison and many others."
5,What an awesome book!,This book produces awesome results!!! Be active with the assignments and the things that will happen for you will be amazing.
5,Old but New,"I bought this book hoping to find Napoleon Hill's MasterMind course. I have it in my hands. Because it was originally published in 1928 the wording is a bit flowery, but the guts of what he has to say has been proven over and over again since he wrote it down. Wonderfully written with many examples, clear explanations, inspiring each of us to do Better than before with the information he shares with us. 'Wealth' is possible when any one applies the basic rules he lays out - physically, financially, etc."
5,A must read for everyone who wants to be successful,This book is an opportunity to reinvent yourself and build the self-confidence you need to do anything you put your mind to. A must read for all...a great reminder of the important things in life.
4,It was great except one chapter.,There was a lot of great information in the book and even the one chapter I had issues with about some kind of mined control was at least interesting. I would recommended the book to those that are interested in history and business. You need to read one chapter every week and work on that chapter all that week. It really is a good educational type book. It was worth the money I spent on it.
4,"Awesome, fun to read!","Lots of interesting related stories interwind in the lessons. A bit hard to find the gems quickly, but all in all a good read."
5,Lessons for life,I have heard a lot about this book from my friends so I decided get it from Kindle store since I am in Brazil. If you are looking for some practical lessons about leadership or how to be successful I recommend The Law of Success. Napoleon Hill shares with us what he learned from the best business men he met during more than twenty years when interviewing and studying the most successful men of USA. Wonderful lessons to learn.
1,Jazz Lover,"OUCH! My Ears! I knew it would be bad, but, WOW! Frank Stallone has butchered some of the best Jazz standards as well as embarassing some good musicians that were trying to hide his tone deafness. Almost mediocre, at best."
5,SUPER STALLONE SWING VOCALIST,"Great Swing Indeed! But beware, this CD has been issued prevously with the title ""DAY IN DAY OUT"" in the early 90's on the USA label. Arrangements of Sam Nestico are absolutely fabulous, really higly reccomended !"
5,it's an outdoor ashtray!,Great ashtray. My husband smokes cigars every evening and we keep this ashtray outside. It is very nice and heavy...AND we use it to keep the cover over the grill during storms! Seriously! Good ashtray!
5,Nicely done,"Exceptionally well crafted text. Practical and pragmatic, covers a lot of ground. An excellent starting point for a development team, or an individual programmer, who is looking for the boost to productivity and quality that can come from a well thought and and carefully executed approach to development."
5,The heartaches are free !,"Wow- I wish Country radio was cool and daring enough to play a song like ""The heartcahes are free"" on this cd. It's Dwight Yoakum meets Hank Williams all the way. It's the purest Country song I've ever heard from a Country artist of today. This cd proves that Dwight knows what Country music is supposed to sound like regardless of the current hot flash trends. I'll jump for joy in the streets when Country music starts sounding like Country music again but until that time comes ( if ever) I'll pop in my Dwight Yoakam cd's. P.S. any cat that digs Buck Owens is alright in my book."
4,Dwight always puts me right there...,"His easy, relaxed voice puts me in an old convertible, on the open road in dusty, hot West Texas. Which is a nice mental getaway for a NYer. Love him and this CD is a great addition to my country music collection."
5,"A great CD, as expected from Dwight","This CD is everything that I expected from Dwight. It is wonderful. Dwight played a few songs from it at a concert I recently attended. When I heard ""What do you know about love"" I could not wait for the CD. I knew it was going to be good. This is yet again a great CD from Dwight!"
2,Should Be Old Fiddle Sounds,"Was expecting something new (instruments, sounds, etc.), but it had too much fiddle. The CD itself was a poor copy in that it had 4 or 5 skips during a couple of the songs. Feel like I wasted my money."
1,Poor value,"I manage a large business association in Canada and was looking for something special, particularly given the price(although credit to Amazon for pointing out the high price). This tape was not worth the postage. I was looking for some concrete tips about networking, rather found a weak testimonial about why people ought to network. It is also old, 1991, (which Amazon advertised.) Useful content simply wasn't there. It was also very short, maybe 20 minutes. I returned the product."
2,iUniverse needs editors,"As an online work of fiction, this was a good piece of work. As a publication, it leaves a fair amount to be desired, not the least of which would be the quality of editing provided by iUniverse. I couldn't concentrate on the book because I was too busy dealing with the errors all over the place.As a novel, Roman's work is a decent start--unfortunately, having been started out in a serialized form, it doesn't make the transition to a novel very well. The story arc is jumpy, the characters display a level of awareness and emotional intensity associated only with people on Ecstasy highs, or serious hallucinogens. However, Roman isn't a bad writer--I would suggest picking this book up as a used text or borrowing it before buying it."
2,A potentially great writer and his failed novel,"Roman Gensis has the potential to be a great writer. He can clearly craft a narrative that is compelling, his style is smooth, his characters have depth. As noted by a previous reviewer, the copy editor should be fired. The text is filled with spelling and grammer errors. More importantly, the author chooses to add another volume to the long history of ""tragic gay boy"" novels. When the young author was still a child, this was the only type of novel about gay youth that could be published. The hidden meaning was clear: the universe ground gay boys under its heels in punishment for their deviation. Today we have positive or at least balanced portrayals like Bob Meets Boy and Rainbow Boys. The author may view his attempts a advocacy in the novel as redemptive. The tragic ending overwhelms any sense of redemption. At a time when life is already overwhelming to them, youth should be steered well clear of this dark tome."
1,I HATED IT!!!!,The characters sucked. The plot sucked. The overly-traumatic-total-break-down-of-an-ending sucked. And people shouldn't read the worthless piece of crap until they're old and about to die! The ending was so sad that it ruined everything and if it hadn't been for that... it would've recieved FIVE stars from Mr. Happy. So there. =(
1,A waste of precious reading time.,"The Challoner Bride was an average adventure romance. Very predictable. Not very emotionally engaging. At under 200 pages, a quick read.Wizard is a story that had a great deal of potential had it been developed differently. Sophy's self-depricating manner of handling her issues of not living up to her parents's expectations and rebelling against all things academic grew tiresome very quickly. That Max took advantage of her when she was most vulnerable seemed terribly out-of-character for him, and tarnished his image and his likability in my eyes. The resulting conflict and bickering that ensued between them was so awful it became almost unbearable to read. The same storyline could have been presented so much better, which would have turned this into a very sweet and realistic feel-good romance, rather than something that was an unsatisfying struggle to muddle though."
3,Both are dated but not unreadable,"There are many 1980s romance novels that I just can't bear to read. The heroines are so wimpy and the heroes are such macho jerks that I find them unreadable. The stories in Worth the Risk are not that bad. Yes, the women are a little too submissive and the men a little too condensending but I have read much worse.The Challoner Bride was the weaker of the two. It had just enough supernatural element to make you go ""HUH?"" but not enough supernatural element to make it interesting. I didn't like the male lead all that much either. It was his way or the highway and he always knew what was best for the little lady. Yuck.Wizard was better but there was still the lead male being all macho and possesive and the heroine wimping out (and even enjoying it). That's so dated!Still, these stories were written by Jayne Ann Krentz which means you at least have interesting characters and snappy dialogue. That's a lot more than you get with most romances coming out of the 1980s."
5,awesome,This was an awesome product and in excellent condition when I received it. It was much easier to order than it is to try to write a review about it!
3,Automatic Watches Stink!,"The watch itself is very nice quality and feel. My problem is the automatic feature. This watch only stays wound for 1 day, so if you do not wear it every day, it stops and you have to reset it. I knew what I was getting myself into with automatic, but I thought it would stay charged for longer than 24 hours. Buy the battery version!!!"
1,Pass on this watch,"This watch has broken twice on me, once after getting a replacment. The problem is with the crown/knob that comes out when catching on anything because it's just to big. Sometimes the crown comes out just enough to stop the watch from working (which means you lose time) and the crown has come completely out/off the watch before and I was lucky to find on the ground."
4,Little drill big power,"This is the handiest drill I have used. I bought one myself, because of the one we have were I work. Use it there all of the time and it just keeps on going,and let me tell you we put it through all kinds of different jobs. You can't go wrong bying this little jewel"
4,Holds it own!,"I work on cars for a living and was a little skeptical at first, but this compact driver holds it own.I use it on a daily basis and the battery holds up for a good amount of time (days). The light is an excellent feature for those hidden spaces that escape the room light. Like the extending pistol grip when I need a little more reach. And having that second battery is priceless when I need to get the job done and don't have time wait for one to charge. Good investment for sure"
3,Good but no variable speed,I purchsed the Makita a month ago and it is good but I was disappointed that there was no speed adjustment. It is very fast so I have found it hard to use on some applications. Otherwise it is typical good quality Makita.
2,Too fast for a SCREWDRIVER,"The speed is much too fast to function as a screwdriver. If you're shopping for an cordless IMPACT driver- ignore this review. If you're shopping for a cordless SCREWDRIVER, ignore this model.Many searches and reviews include this model when listing available ""cordless screwdrivers"" It's an IMPACT driver, and can probably double as a small drill. But it is NOT a cordless screwdriver.The 2 STARs rating does NOT refer to quality or reliability, but only it's ability to serve as a cordless screwdriver."
3,Good at some things,"While I like Makita tools, this one has some real disadvantages. The one speed unit makes it almost impossible to drive a slot head screw. You are guaranteed to strip it or damage the surrounding surface when it flies off the slot. The power is great for a little guy. Drilling with this is okay except in metal where the ability to start slowly is an advantage. You will not start slowly with this thing."
3,not too bad not too good,"Does not have a ""clutch"" so need to be mindful when screwing into soft material. Has plenty power, but basically only two choices, on which is fast or off. Screwdriver bit will jump out of screw head once screw has reached point where it will no longer turn."
5,Great tool,"I have had mine for two years now, and find it one of my goto tools for driving screws. It have drop it several times and it still works fine,I like it so much, this christmas I bought four of them for my son's.You won't be sorry."
1,Don't do it!,"My DeWalt 7.2v driver finally bit the dust after many years of solid service, so I went looking for a replacement. I have the Makita 18v Lithium Ion contractors set, and it has served me well. BTW, I am a contractor.When I saw this unit, I thought ""Great, a smaller, lighter, more powerful version of the DeWalt driver. Leave it to Makita."" WRONG!This is **NOT** a professional quality unit. It is better suited to homeowners who just want to have a small, underpowered unit for very light duty work. It's problems are many...1. No variable speed control.2. VERY weak clutch which is not adjustable either.3. Despite being Lithium Ion powered, it has a very low battery life.I was foolish enough to believe that the quality people at Makita would never let a product of this terrible quality go into production. Silly me. Bottom line - Get the 7.2v DeWalt driver. It's what this Makita dreams of being when it grows up."
2,hard to use,"This powerful little impact driver is quite hard to use. Instead of a trigger, it has buttons for forward and reverse. And it has only one speed: full force. The combination of button and single-speed makes it very hard to control. I find it impossible to start a screw without spinning in the head, and slipping off, and going crooked. And this is with Robertson and star-drive as well as Phillips, and using a screw guide and a magnetic screw holder. The immediate force of the little driver, and maybe the uncentered action of pushing the button sideways, overwhelms all my best screwdriving methods."
5,Very powerful for a screwdriver but I love iy...,"I bought this because I needed a powerful screwdriver and boy was I right. This thing has loads of power. I love the impact power of this screwdriver. I have only charged the battery once since I've had it and I use it every day and so far it's still on the first battery on its first charge. The only down side to this screwdriver is it's no load speed. It's so fast that you really need to start fatheaded screws by hand. Otherwise I love it. It came with 2 batteries; carry case, charger, drill bit and 2 other bits."
5,Makita TD020DSEW,Makita TD020DSEW 7.2-Volt Lithium-Ion Cordless Straight Line Impact Driver KitA great household tool. Strong and lightweight.
3,"Good, but",OK tool. White color will look dirty and worn a lot more quickly. Tools do get scratched and dirty. No bit holder and cant buy a double ended screwdriver bit that will fit this model. Cheap black and decker would use a double end bit so did not have to carry around a phillps and common bit. Nothing to lose.Do not like the impact feature since you can not tell how tight the screw is as you are driving it. It will keep trying to drive a screw when the screw is tight. Like the Hatachi one a little better just because of the impact feature.
2,no impact...,"Not much of an ""impact drill"" no good as a screw driver (no variable speed) not a very good drill (can't start at slow speed to avoid ""walking"").So what's the point in buying this tool. I regret it"
4,packs a lot,"Yep the Makita cordless packs a lot... in a very compact package.The first time I used this 'pencil' style impact screwdriver I didn't really have high hopes.... too small, too low voltage. Man was I mistaken!This unit has become an indispensable addition to the tool bag I take everywhere. Rusted bolts? No sweat. Heavy wood lags? Zip! They pop right out. Need to drop a transmission from a Caterpillar excavator? Guess again (this thing does have it's limits).All in all, I will keep this one of these little powerhouses in both my truck and my airplane. I never know where I will use it next."
3,"Ok, for the homemaker","Good enough for the homemaker but not much more. Strong enough for household tasks, but not up to doing job site stuff all day long. Great for just around the house, and if you get it free :) you can't beat it."
2,1 speed....not good for me.,"I have had a couple of cordless screwdrivers in the past. They were always great for small household projects....like fixing toys, installing electrical plates when doing painting projects, etc. My last one died and I asked for a new one for X-mas. When I received this tool (Makita which I normally like) I assumed it would exceed the performance of those other devices. It absolutely did, but it comes at a cost. This thing is too much tool for what I had in mind and I am going to return it and replace with something a little smaller. It has no variable speed which makes it kind of overkill for the kind of tool I had in mind. I am afraid I would break more things than I would fix if I tried to use this and I already have 2 or 3 drills in my workshop. So....don't shy away from this if you need something in lieu of a good drill, but if you already have one this might be redundant...and since it has only 1 speed it might even not be preferable."
2,What's the point of this tool?,"Not much of an ""impact drill"" no good as a screw driver (no variable speed) not a very good drill (can't start at slow speed to avoid ""walking"").So what's the point in buying this tool. I regret it"
3,Some Pro-Cons,"Pros: Plenty of power, 2 Ion Battiers a plus, size/wght OK, Light a plus,plenty of accessories w/unit.Cons: Color, no variable speed, Light has to be turn on manually two(2)times to use, no written charger instructions, trying to register the product over the Internet is a lesson in nonsense."
1,worth about 1/2 of what it cost,"This item, in theory, is a great way to store lots of cds in a small amount of space. However, it does not assemble well, e.g., the pre-drilled holes are often not the right size, etc. I ruined the top of mine trying to force it onto the screws. The instructions are not very specific, either. They don't tell you where to attach the one fixed shelf so you have to guess. It's not until you've got the whole thing put together and are loading it up that you realize you've misjudged where it should go, leaving two options: the top shelf on both sides is too small or you have to start all over again! It's definetly not worth the price I paid."
4,Ahead of its time,"You can't say too much about the plot of this book without becoming a spoiler. If you like suspense books and/or plots with a post-war Nazi theme (e.g. The Odessa Files) with a techno-thriller twist, you'll like this book. It's held up well for a book written and set in the 70s. I've always thought of Ira Levin as the literary version of Alfred Hitchcock and this is another good example."
5,Suspenseful,I really enjoyed this book. A suspenseful story. I think this is the best Neue Nazi novel that has ever been written.
3,INTERESTING BUT ??????????,"It is hard to review this book. It is well written of course. Mr. Levin's books are always easy to read & keep your interest. In ""Boys From Brazil"" there is something lacking or maybe there is just too much evil. I have read so many holocaust, Nazi era, WWII, books & there is usually something in them that gives you a break from the nauseating evil that is the subject of the book. In this story of Dr. Mengele there isn't any let up - it is just pure evil all the way through."
4,captivating summer reading,"This is a very interesting book to take with you on vacation -- there is no chance you will get bored. It is not a piece of literature that requires great deals of concentration. No way! But it is an easy-to-read and captivating story, which shows that Ira Levin has plenty of imagination and a gift for creating suspense.The story takes place in 1974 and involves Dr. Mengele, known as the Angel of Death, a famous figure in the concentration camp of Auschwitz during World War II. In the story, he is involved in a crazy and revolutionary project, designed to lay new seeds for the Aryan dominance in the world.I admire the writer's gift for creating vivid dialogue and a well built story so compelling that it was difficult for me to put the book aside, just what I wanted for perfect reading at the seaside."
3,Enjoyable,"The story does a nice job of drawing you into the plot. A young boy working clandestinely in South America wiretaps a meeting of some very high level men talking about killing 94 people. As he relays his story, and his recording, over the phone to someone he knows would want to hear it, he is murdered. The story now is about the receiver of the call figuring out the plot and foiling it.Quite an easy read and the plot is believable. For me though the book lacked character development insomuch as we really aren't given time to get to know the players well enough.From a cat and mouse standpoint it's a great read. As the tired, overwrought and underfunded hero deciphers the call he almost heard and translates it into a plot that has to be foiled at all costs. His efforts to apprehend the plot perpetrators are quite well thought out.As I mentioned, an easy read and, a pretty good movie too. Try and read the book before seeing the movie as the book adds some background the movie doesn't."
4,The Fourth Reich,The writer of this book was Ira Levin. This is a story about Nazi Germans plotting to spark the beginning of a fourth Reich by systematically murdering 94 men who are 64 to 66 years old.I sort of liked the book because I like learning about WW2 stuff. The science behind this book is relevant to today. It's kind of scary to think of what would happen if it were real.
3,Fabulous thriller,"Still seems to haunt us, given the more recent clonings of things, not only sheep."
1,Book is in poor condition,"I was very disappointed at this purchase. First of all, the book is broken into half when I received it. Secondly, the story doesn't appeal to me at all."
2,Interesting scientifically but dry otherwise,they have a movie of this book but whatever you do don't see it. Far worse than the book. I hate to admit it but even John Grisham writes better books than this guy. Anyway..if anyone ever reads this review. I wouldn't recommend it
2,Cute But Won't Stay Closed,"This necklace is incredibly cute! When I received it, I immediately jotted something down and put it in the box. However, the lid will not stay closed when worn! I have not been able to wear it again since the box hangs from the hinge on the lid, wide open."
5,2nd in series,This book concentrates on the Purl Stitch. It shows how to use the same stitch in different ways and how it affects the fabric it creates.
5,"A ""Must Have"" book for knitters","The Knitting Experience: Book 2: The Purl Stitch by Sally Melville is a ""must have"" book for any knitter. It clearly explains the basics of knitting but expands the experience by allowing the reader to grasp the simple concepts that make complicated knitting projects. The patterns it offers are simple yet elegant. I've been knitting for almost 30 years and I still learned from this book."
3,AN ERROR IN HER KNITTING INSTRUCTIONS,"ATTENTION KNITTERS: **VERY IMPORTANT!**I am currently knitting from BOOK 2: THE PURL STITCH EXPERIENCE.The pattern I am knitting is: To-The Cottage Pullovers (Pgs. 136 through 139). After spending LONG hours trying to get the 3-block pattern for 76 stitches, I realize after not being able to sleep through the night thinking about it, THERE IS AN ERROR IN HER INSTRUCTION. For those who will be knitting this pattern, on pages 137 * 148, 3-block pattern chart, CORRECTION IS:rows 13, 15, 17, 19 (RS) K8, *P8, K8, repeat from * to 8 sts remaining, P8There are a few sweater patterns using this 3-block plattern, so BEWARE AND READ CAREFULLY before you get frustrated like I did. Knitting a guage was no problem. The problem arised when I was acutally knitting the swetaer. The publisher should correct this and send me a new copy FREE OF CHARGE!any questions relating to this 3-block pattern, write to graphicprd@sbcglobal.netThank you"
2,Highly questionable motives...,"This is a actual excerpt from the book ""... there is nothing admirable or beautiful about today's NBA player: diamond studded ears, flesh plastered with offensive body tattoos, and nicknames like 'The Answer' and 'Big Dog.'""Are you serious? Personal appearance is now a problem in the NBA as well? Bring back the white guys with the crew cuts!Benedict has a agenda, and even went as far to exaggerate the skills of certain players that committed a crime. A whole two chapters were devoted to Sam Mack... who I forgot existed until I vaguely remembered a shooter that played for the Rockets. Noting that players like Jerry Stackhouse, Damon Stoudamire and Jason Richardson were all-stars when in fact none of them have ever made the team. Should I trust the rest of his facts he presents?"
1,Biased and imbalanced,"Having read a few books by Mr. Benedict, I am beginning to question his motives. Is he writing for shock value, or is there a darker agenda hidden here? Questionable statistics, and even more questionable conclusions. Singling out a group of men, using anecdotal evidence, and drawing broad conclusions about the group as a whole is somewhat frightening in my opinion. A shameless attack on NFL players that simply promotes prejudice without any enlightening social content in evidence. Pathetic!"
2,Just not a good read,"Having read and enjoyed Benedict's earlier effort, ""Pro's and Cons"", I was anxiously awaiting this book and was subsequently thoroughly let down. There's much to do about the painstakingly intense research and hard work in putting this material together, but in the end it just was not a good read. Subpar research, 1-sided storytelling, bad writing -- all attributing."
5,Very moving,"As a young girl myself who is about to be married, I found myself reflecting a lot on my own life while reading ""All But My Life."" This story embodies the best of all genres: action, romance, true crime, biography, and even the occasional nod at humor. I recommend this book especially to young women. A lot can be learned from the strengths....and weaknesses of Gerda. She is a brilliant author who knows the way to bring all of the wonderfully eccentric characters and utterly horrific experiences to life. A must read!!"
5,ASTOUNDING !,"This book was astounding, the things this woman went through made me depressed for a week. That supposed "" humans "" could treat their fellow man/woman so horribly was awful! A mad dog would not be treated this way. It seems no matter how much i read on the Holacaust, the inhumanity of the nazis & their kind ,germans/poles /hungarians & others who slaughtered / betrayed the jews ,just so they could steal their belongings & often just to watch them suffer, is beyond human comprehension . I would suppose "" people "" like these is one of the reasons GOD created HELL, just for these "" people "" ! God bless the Jews everywhere."
5,Dawn,This is an excellent book! Should be required reading for anyone studying the Holocaust. It is a miracle that this woman was able to live though the horrible conditions imposed on her by Nazi Germany!Read it! You will not be disappointed!
5,Wonderful,It was an inspirational story about a young woman's courage to survive despite what people might say about the future. I highly recommend this wonderful book...
5,A Fantastic Read,"I read this book many years ago, lost the book, and recently repurchased it. I have to tell you...this book will jerk the tears right out of your eyes. It makes you appreciate the life we have here. Gerda gives you a clear, true, and heartwrenching perspective of what is was like to be captured by the Nazis, thrown in a concentration camp, and left there to die. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to read about a truly remarkable woman who survived such a horrible atrocity. I finished the book feeling completely inspired by her touching story."
5,One of the greatest biographies I've ever read,"I found this treasure, a battered former school library book, at a used book sale. I have read many Holocaust books and thought I'd give this one a try. I had no idea what I was in for.It is a page-turner, beautifully written, compelling and heartbreaking right up to the end."
5,Truly Inspirational,"I find the strength of Gerda Weissmann to be truly inspirational. This is a wonderful book that tells the real life story of a young Jewish girl who survives the Holocaust. I am a 7th grade social studies teacher and I use this book with my students. After reading this book I feel that Gerda is an absolute hero. I have since learned that she has devoted her life to helping others through speaking about her experiences, helping to feed the hungry, and speaking with others who have survived tradegy. In a society where we put people on pillars and give them popularity and monetary success for much, much, much less, Gerda is a true hero who deserves all peoples attention and gratutity."
5,Page Turner,This book was gripping and I could not put it down until I finished it. It's so hard to believe the hardships so many endured for being Jewish. A must read. Beautifully written with rich detail.
5,A very good read,This was one of those books that was hard to put down. I looked forward to my reading time and then kept saying to myself i would put it down after this chapter and then just to say after the next chapter. A very interesting book.
5,Amazing,"I read this book for an eigth grade English project last year. It is truely touching and amazing to think how the world once was, and still is in some areas of the world. When I read this book, I could hardly put it down. Even now, it makes me remember the pain the war caused. This is a good read that speaks the truth."
5,a chilling inspiration,"Gerda Weissmann Klein does a wonderful job of retelling her tragic and utterly heartbreaking experience during Nazi occupation and internment. Throughout the years of torture, starvation, and sadness, Gerda was surrounded by the death of her family and friends, but maintained an optimistic outlook. ""Surely the end of the war is near and all of this will be over soon,"" was her stance, and she gave hope to the girls who were forced to travel from camp to camp with her. Be prepared to cringe and most likely cry while reflecting on Gerda's strength and the wonder of how she lived through the horror of the Nazi regime."
4,I am so glad she has her life,"This book started a little slow for me. I have read many memoirs about this time. Gerda was a strong woman who lived because she made a promise. The thing that made me really appreciate this novel was that it was the first I had read that maybe one of the German guards had a small but of decency. This was a horrible time and evil overcame normal everyday people. One of the best things is Gerda Weissman told the story of what happened after her liberation. I am so glad Gerda survived and I grieve for the ones that were lost. We must all learn from this story and all others not told, this must never happen again. Gerda has used her story for the good of all mankind and I thank her for sharing it."
3,All But My Life,"""All buy my life"" by Gerda Weissmann Klein is a tragic story about a young girl living life during the Holocaust. It talks about her survival for three years under the control of the Nazis and the story of her amazing liberation.This book is a great book for most teenagers beacuse it touches on sensative subjects such as family and love, and some aspects of the story can really be related to you.Although the story is great, at times it may be confusing for readers as it switches greatly and very fast.This book is an amazing story and it really makes a huge impact on you after you read it."
5,Fun,"I had a small issue with one of the boxes. I emailed the seller and the customer service I received was out of this world. They sent me a brand new box, no questions. These sellers really care about their buyers. So many times we encounter poor customer service. Not here. Love the box, my kids (5) and (4) are learning math and having fun. The adults love to play it too. Buy it, you will not be disappointed."
4,Great family gift,"This is a great family game that can be enjoyed with children who can add, all the way to Grandparents. We sat at a reunion of 17 people including adults and children and passed it around for hours. The kids will come in and just pick it up and start playing. When my Grandchildren took it to Show & Tell, the teacher asked for one to keep in the room for all to use. I gave it to her and just purchased this one to replace it."
5,Very interesting game,"This is a very interesting and fun game. My daughter enjoys t. It was played by sailors long back and gives lot of strategic thinking capabilities for children, how to solve problems, how to think ahead and above it all fum game. The box is nice, good velvet, dice is good. No complaints! A fun family game."
3,"Decent game, could be made better.",This is a decent game. My wife and I tried it and we both like it. The rules that come with it could be more detailed. The wooden box itself is pretty cheap. There's some glue on the top of the felt in one of the corners. I think it would be a good game for a kid that's learning addition.
2,Shut the Box Game,"I bought this because a friend told me she plays it all the time with her grandchildren. I found it very uninteresting as did my grands. There is no challenge, not much thinking involved. It's pretty much all luck of the dice."
3,Some Grudges Never Die,"This is an eye-opening book. It will appeal to anyone who enjoys nursing a grudge. Descendants of the so-called Molly Maguires in northeastern Pennsylvania are still smarting over the shame brought upon their Irish forefathers, many of whom were convicted and executed on June 21, 1877, for infamous crimes. This volume is another attempt to overcome the harsh judgment of history. It illustrates how ethnic animosities can smolder for generations."
2,Great Book For Molly Lovers,"I ahve never seen a better book about Irish home cooking. All the potato recipes are great and the tips for making ""Easy Hibernian Hash"" with porter and aged cabbage are fantastic. Some of my other favorite Irish recipes are Tamaqua Toast, Mock Chunky Campbell's Soup and Kerrigan's Squeal. Oh yeah, watch out for ""Morgan Powell's Killer Cocktail,"" it's a drink you won't forget. The jury has rendered its verdict, this book is a winner!!"
2,CHEAP DIRECT TO VIDEO MOVIE,"This movie is just like every other action flick, but on a smaller budget. Violence, explosions, car chases, explosions and uh... explosions don't make a movie great. Robert Patrick is in it and he is actually quite good with the script he has to work with. I can hear him right now yelling, ""I need a better agent"". This movie is not very good but I've seen way worse."
5,hi temp cement,This is the only product around and so far so good. Its consistency is that of clay. After applying it must be heat cured to harden.
4,Love,"This book is fantastic, it tells about a high school girl who was gratuating from High School and preparing herself to go to college. Well, she had this really good friends of hers and they always hung out together. This friend was a guy, who she suddenly felt in love with... Now the ideas to go to college got more complicated because she was falling in love with the guy. I mean It's never easy leaving home especially when you've fallen in love for the first time. This books explains how she worked that out!!It's a great book especially for girls who are falling in love for the firt time or going away to college!"
5,Excellent!! I LUV IT!!!!,Daddy's Little Girl is my favorite book! It is so good I couldn't put it down. I justed loved it so much!
4,Daddy's Little Girl,"Despite many of the other reviews calling this book predictable, I found it to be a page turner! I have always enjoyed Mary Higgins Clark and Daddy's Little Girl did not disapoint, if you are also a fan I am sure that you will enjoy it too. 4 STARS!"
2,im disappointed,"As an avid fan of MHC, I have read all her books, but I am quite disappointed with her latest. When I pick up one of her books I am always positive that I will find suspense and surprise with each page I turn, and the end is always a complete surprise. Daddy's Little Girl created no suspense and was completely predictable. I enjoyed reading it simply because she is a fabulous author no matter what, but this is not one of her best."
2,Mary Higgins At Her Worst,When I saw this book I was so excited to read it. At first I was really into it but then later on it just turned me off. There was no suspense in this book and you knew who the killer was.DON'T READ AHEAD IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK YETI knew that Paulie wasn't the killer. He was too stupid and helpless to d something like that. The whole book was pretty obvious. I also missed the usual romance that MHC usually adds to her book. The whole thing b/w Ellie and Pete just wasn't enough. The end of the book with the one year later thing diudn't seem to fit. It just seemed like a hasty ending to a not so good book. I was left feeling deceived after reading this book.
5,Good one!,"A Mary Higgins Clark book is always a good read with some better than others. I really enjoyed this one - in fact I couldn't put it down. Did anyone else pick out some real life characters in the book? I did and that made it even better.Take it home, find a comfortable chair and enjoy! But don't plan on getting any housework done until the last page is turned."
5,Back on Top,"Miss Clark has shown me again why she is my favorite author. From the first page of ""Where are the Children?"" to the last page of ""Daddy's Little Girl"", I've never been able to stop reading until I reach the end of book.This book is the best of the last several she has written, and I am glad she has taken the risk to try something new. It has added a freshness to the storytelling.If you've not read something by Mary Higgins Clark, read this one. If you've read her before, this is unlike the other books she's written.Simply put, this book is a winner."
1,DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL,"Where have all the authors gone? Has everyone run out of new ideas? Grisham, Peterson, etc. And again Mary Higgins Clark. I have been so disappointed in her last few books I had hoped she was finally going to come up with something more like here earlier efforts. I read a review where someone said this was a page turner....only because I was speed reading to get to the end. There is no suspense and a very dull story line. I am beginning to wonder if Mary Higgins Clark is still writing or just passing an outline to her very untalented daughter to fill in the blanks. What happened to the author who made you beg for more? The author who wrote books that you really truly could not put down? It is one thing to run out of ideas ... it is another to waste over 300 pages telling a short story that could be told in 25 pages. Wake up Mary Higgins Clark.....if this is all you can offer you will lose tha audience that has been your mainstay over the years."
1,"Same story, different characters","Once again, America's ""Queen of Suspense"" has written another best-seller with the same dependable formula. Damsel in distress, with the odds stacked against her, manages to unveil the bad guy and find love in the process. Year after year Clark churns out the same predictable plot, and while it seems monotonus, you have to hand it to her, she's created a successful market. Read this if you don't want to be surprised in the end or if you're loyal to Clark's novels."
2,Ho-Hum........,"I kept waiting for a story to grab me like many of Mary Higgins Clark's earlier fare, but this one didn't do it, sad to say. Rather plodding and lackluster. I wonder at the proof-reading skills of the editor because on page 29 it said Ellie was 30 and on page 143 it said at the same time that she was 29 during the same incident . Also it said on page 139 that a cheese, lettuce & tomato sandwich was all that there was to eat (refrigerated items obviously) and on page 144 it said ""I also did not want to empty the refrigerator"" What was there to empty? (please note: I quote these pages from the paperback version). I know these are small things, but it shows how poorly the story was for me to even be able to pick up on these errors!"
3,"So, so",This was my first Mary Higgins Clark read and I am not sure I will pick up another of her books. This book was slow to start and rushed at the end. I am still not sure at what point the story climaxed. A dry read.
3,TOO DAMN SLOW,"This book started a little bit interesting but as i kept reading it was very slow, nothing interesting and very boring at the end, the final disappointed me."
4,My book task review,I thought that this was a pretty cool book. It was mostly mystery but there was suspense and drama and stuff in the book. Some parts of the book gave me the chills. The book was also interesting like how the sister tried her whole life proving that the person she most suspected of killing her sister really was the killer but nobody believed her at first. This book taught me to tell my parents if my sisters are doing something there not suppose to because maybe I will save a life or something I don't know. I would encourage everybody to read this book because it will really teach you something and even send chills down your spine. That's why I am giving this book 4 stars.
4,very good!!,the story is as exciting as always but it is too obvious who is the murderer.but at all the story is very good.I very enjoyed it.Buy it!!
2,Could Hve Been Better,"This book was a disappointment. I have read others of Mary Higgins Clarks and have found that they were very good. But, this one I think she could have done WAY better with the ending."
2,Predictable,"From the very beginning, you knew the ending. What puzzles me, though, is that most of the book seems to have been written by a ghost writer. Very few pages were written in her style. [For instance, she usually likes to use verbiage such as, ""festive"" or ""fabulous"" and also gets into clothing descriptions]. Actually, it was a pleasant reprieve from the usual Danielle Steel style of writing. For that, I give it the two stars. I also found the main character to be a little ditsy. Who in their right mind would stand in front of a large prison, as inmates are being released on parole, holding up a sign with her phone number on it? It wasn't believable.I liked Mary Higgens Clark's first few books the best."
2,Phoning it in,"Although her books are formulaic to say the least, I generally enjoy MHC's books quite a bit. The heroines are fun, the plots are enjoyable, and the villain is not always obvious, making for suspenseful reading. It was disappointing, therefore, to read her latest, as the heroine was deadly dull and the story was predictable and flat (in fact, it appeared to me that MHC must have been having some trouble thinking of an interesting story as, instead of her usual creativity, we are treated to a rip-off of the Martha Moxley murder here; how appropriate that the book was released almost to the day of the Skakel trial's opening). Hope this putrid approximation of a MHC novel isn't a harbinger of books to come...."
2,So where was the big mystery???,"I have read all of MHC's books.Her earlier books were so much better.There was a sense of mystery in them.This latest book is entertaining,but I kept waiting for the big suspenseful ending.Unfortunately,there wasn't one.The book wasn't suspenseful at all. It was entertaining,but not worth the money to buy it.Pick it up at your local library instead."
2,"Slow Moving, Boring","This was okay but slow moving to me. Investigative reporter seeks to put away her sister's murdered after he got out on parole. The entire book was about revenge but wasn't very believable to me. I didn't care for it so didn't read any other books by Mary Higgins Clark.Karen Arlettaz Zemek, Author of ""My Funny Dad, Harry"""
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. I am a long time fan of Mary Higgins Clark and had waited with great anticipation for this book. The lead character was flat, the plot and who-done-it was known from the beggining. No real suspense. I couldn't even tell that the lead character was involved in a romance until the very end when she married the guy. This was Ms. Clark's first time writing only in the first person, perhaps that affected her. Hope she goes back to her former winning style! Don't buy this in hardback, not worth the money."
2,Disappointed,"I was actually quite disappointed in this novel from Ms. Clark. I am an avid reader of her books and always look forward to the next. However, this one did not in any way live up to her reputation as the queen of Mystery Writers. It was suspensful, but did not end with its(story) in a conclusion other than one in a documentory.Ellie did not encounter as the heroine the many obstacle and hairline mishaps that heroines in other of Ms. Clark's books have had to endure. This was truly an elaboration on a real crime and I can only hope this will not further lead to other stories or a trend by the author. Please go back to your usual style."
1,Don't waste your time with this novel,"This novel was a big disappointment for me. I've read other MHC novels before and enjoyed most of them, but this was just bad. Andrea, a teenager, is murdered and a rich boy is found guilty. Twenty years later, the murderer is going out on parole and he's produced a witness out of thin air that puts the blame on someone else and he's looking for a second trial. Andrea's sister is determined to prove he was the killer without shadow of a doubt and, here's the main problem - she succeeds with almost no effort. Everything works well for her. She discovers leads that all point to him and gets outs of a couple of attempts against her life with just a scratch. Throughout the novel you're led to believe that she is wrong, that someone else was really the killer, but the disappointing truth is she's been always right! This ""novel"" is just a short story inflated to occupy several pages. It's not boring to read, but in the end it's just a waste of time."
2,No no no,oh my goodness the begining was great but as i went to the middle it became so boring i had to stop. i am serious their was barely any character development and it was just boring.
3,The First Time She's Ever Let Me Down,"For the first time, I was disappointed with a Mary Higgins Clark book. The style was lacking her regular pizzaz, almost as if she, herself didn't write the book. I found the story bland and really only enjoyed the feeling of suspense in the last ten pages."
2,Skip to the end,"The middle chapters were long and boring, some having no bearing on the plot - just filler as they say in soap opera land."
3,Good Story - lacking Mystrey,"Daddy's Little Girl is a story of Ellie Cavanaugh coming to terms with her sisters death, and the reconcillation with her father. The story predicatible and lacks mystrey. The killer is never really questionable. Paulie is offered as a very weak secondary villian. The reader never is really lead to believe that he is capable. The main character Ellie, is consumed with guilt about her sister's death and is out to bring Rob Westerfield to a justice. Yes, he has been in prison, but that is not enough. Ellie's character is one that strives for dimension and achieves it on many occasions, so if you want a story of a 30 year old woman coming to terms with the past, forgiving her father and building a relationship with a brother she never knew before, this is a great book. But if you are seeking a mystrey that will keep you thinking, guessing and on the edge of your seat, this is not it."
4,Good read,"This book was suspenseful and interesting. Ellie finds her big sister murdered and lives with the feeling of ""what if"" she would have told her parents where her sister was rather than keeping her sister's secret. Years later, Rob, the boyfriend who was charged with the murder, is about to be released from prison. Ellie takes a break from her newspaper job to try and find more evidence and stop him from being released. Rob's family, the Westerfield's are powerful people with lots of money. Ellie is stalked as she tries to discover the truth and keep her sister's killer behind bars. It is a suspenseful read that kept my attention."
2,Dry,"I usually enjoy her books for a bit of light fun reading, but this was absolutely boring and uninteresting. A waste of time."
2,No mystery,"I haven't read many of Mary Higgins Clark's books, so I don't know if this is typical of her plots or not. There was absolutely on mystery or suspense in this book. I was expecting one hell of a surprise or twist at the end because the books was SO predictable. Character development is pretty much absent, too. I give it two stars instead of one mainly because I actually enjoyed reading the novel. It was just that at the end I felt tricked. As another reviewer put it... ""That's it?"""
3,my opinion,I have read almost all of her books and I must say I wasent impressed with this one .. Although I did enjoy It I just dident finish It in one day like I have many of her other books..
2,Did MHC really write this?,"I have to admit I listened to this rather than read it, but from the beginning I had a hard time believing that MHC wrote this. It was very amateurish. Not up to par at all. Very repetitious and who writes a mystery where the person suspected at the beginning is the actual culprit. No mystery there. I didn't totally hate it but it was defiantly not close to a favorite."
3,Only for Hardcore Fans,"Once a favorite of mine, Daddy's Little Girl barely makes a mark on my crime and mystery scale. Tedious with guilt-ridden inner monologue and far too many scenarios with food this book reads more like a diary than a novel.Because readers are already given the ""who-dunnit"" there's little chase or apparent danger to entice the readers as the book progresses. Yes, finding out more about Andrea's killer is pretty fun but when every single character Ellie encounters warns her she's in danger, what does she do? IGNORES IT. Watching a train wreck happen slowly is ugly business, let alone reading it.Enjoyable if you're a hardcore fan of the day-to-day accounts in mysteries and suspense otherwise, a book that's decent with an excitable chase scene ending won't cut it for most..... Please click for the <a [...]full review</a>."
4,Pretty good book,"This was the first Mary Higgins Clark book I ever read. I must say I enjoyed it. Daddy's Little Girl is about a 15 year old girl named Andrea who is brutally murdered and the man convicted (who maintaines his innocence throughout) is sent to prison. 23 years later he is released from prison and Andreas sister, Ellie (who was 7 at the time of the murder) tries to stop him getting out and does research on his past to prove that he is guilty of the murder of her sister. Suspenseful, good read. I was pleasantly surprised on my first MHC book."
4,"Not her very best, but it's up there.",MHC is my all-time favorite author and I've read most of her work. This is a good one.
2,"Lots of Style, Little Substance","Daddy's Little Girl is a stylish speed-read, but even as a plot-driven thriller it falls short. Violent but engaging in the earlier chapters, the book quickly devolves into a series of convenient close-brush-with-death events culminating in a sleep-inducing ending. People who love pictures of cute little puppy dogs and babies dressed as sunflowers should have no problem with the last two-thirds of this book, which is as patently undisturbing as the first few chapters are needlessly sensational."
3,Mysterious BMW,"This story was an ok read, but it isn't a ""who-dun-it"", it is just a procedural mystery. As such, I was disappointed at the ending because the build up for a ""revelation"" at the end never happened.Also, the main character flies into Boston and rents a car. About half way through the book however, she has her BMW from Atlanta. Maybe I missed the part where she shipped it north but it made me stop and research the beginning again to determine if I had read the story right.Overall, this is a novel where Ellie (Main character) has meals with a lot of people and talks on the cell phone. It is written well, and kept my interest but the ending turned me off."
1,Disappointingly predictable and simplistic!,I can't tell you how disappointed I am in this book. I have read several of Mary Higgins Clark's novels and have found them quite entertaining...that's why I find it so hard to believe that this is by the same author.There really was no mystery to this book - it is obvious who the criminal is from the very beginning and there are none of the necessary twists in plot that make for an intriguing mystery. It was all just too simplistic and obvious for me....Maybe this is the typical example of a well-known author being able to publish and sell anything simply based on previous accomplishments!
2,Not the best by Mrs. Clark,"I love Mary Higgens Clark and couldn't wait till Daddy's Little Girl was released. I was quite disappointed. First, the killer is revealed very early in the novel and really all you wind up reading about is who is following Ellie around. I'm use to reading a Clark book and guessing who dun it till the last page. Unfortunetly this was not what this book was about. After finishing last night i was very disappointed and felt that most of the chapters had nothing to do with the storyline and were more or less to expand the book. Hopefully, this was just a fluke book by Mrs. Clark and her next will be much better."
3,Another Mystery like her other Mysteries,"I do enjoy this author's mysteries for what they are, light, quick, and a good summer read. I find them more predictable then most mysteries and this one is no exception.A 15 year old girl is murdered in a gruesome manner, it is now 22 years later and her convicted killer is about to be set free. Her sister Ellie, who is an investigative reporter, has come back to town to get to the bottom of things. There are a few twists and turns that urge the reader on. A great book for the beach. I would give this book 3.5 stars. Kelsana"
3,Yippee..... A Good Story,"I almost didn't buy this book as the last book I read by Mary Higgins Clark was a big disappointment. However, I still had to read it since I've read all of her books. This one was not the disappointment I feared it would be. This book was different in that it was written in the first person, and while I normally don't enjoy first-person writing, I did enjoy this approach in this book. My only disappointment was that I wished Ellie's personal relationships had been developed more. The book was an easy read, though, and I recommend it to Mary's current fans and new fans."
2,Bland,Since so many people enjoy her books I thought I would give her a try. I purchased this and another one of her books since it was on sale. I had never read anything by her before. It was awful. There was very little character development and I didn't care what happened to any of them. After reading this I bought the other back without ever reading it. It reminded me of the one Danielle Steele novel I read years ago.
4,good read,"Once you have read most of Mary Higgins-Clark books you get the idea of what most of them are going to be like. this time she tried writing from the first person which was interesting, but it didn't really affect the storyline. The plot was a bit predictable, but it was a fun read."
5,Great Find,What a wonderful way to differentiate assignments for readers. There is enough material here to accomodate many reading levels.
3,Super Reading Activities,i haven't use all the activities in the book there are so many. the kids love them and an work on their own. is great for independent reading.
4,takes time to pepare recipies,One of the things that i want to do in retirement is to prepare healthy tasty foods. I live in upper Michigan and have found obtaining some of the ingredients difficult. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND LOOKING INSIDE BEFORE YOU BUY!
5,A treasure for the Chinese,"I read through the whole cookbooks and enjoyed finding truth about cookign which I had never known. My father is an excellent cook himself. However, he passed away before he could ever taught me the ""how"". I owned a lot of Chinese cookbooks plus over 10 years of recipes clips from Chinese Newspaper. The hardest things to find in the Chinese food's recipes are the secrets to cook a perfect dish. Every bits of information are usually given approximately without actual measurements and the explainations of how and why a dish will fail. I learned a lot of valuable cooking techniques from this book and quite a bit of the art of cooking. This book is for the Chinese who grow up in the United States and people who love cooking!"
4,Needed information,"This cookbook is not just a list of recipes but an interesting biographical journey into the interior. Grace Young writes well about her family providing a personal context for the recipes that she provides.I found the information very good indeed. It is rare to find in one location certain details about buying produce and items from an asian grocery store.The section on what the sauces, vegetables and other items that you can find at the grocers is nice indeed. Usually you would have had to buy a book dedicated to this, but Young provides a good section to get you through.This is my favorite Chinese cookbook so far this year. I find material for personal reflection and also, a source for Chinese food information (almond soup being good for the skin).I agree that Young could have been more lavish with technique and photos but she did very well otherwise. Also, the indexing could have been more detailed, but these are small quibles.Good stuff."
2,The Wisdom of the Chinese Kitchen: Classic Family Recipes,I am a Chineses food lover. I have tried several recipes in this book. They are not impressed me. I would prefer The Chinese Kitchen by Eileen Yin-Fei Lo because her recipes taste closer to some of the best Chinese Cooking we have tried.
5,Fool-proof instructions for any cook,"Even if you are new to cooking, this book will guide you to preparing restaurant-caliber dishes the FIRST time. It tells you step-by-step what to do so that you cannot mess it up. Other cookbooks like `The Chinese Kitchen' are for more advanced cooks.Every recipe from this ""Wisdom of the"" has turned out to be a winner. You'll be stunned at all the veggies you're eating.These dishes are so authentic, that some of them may not be what the average American thinks of in terms of Chinese cuisine. That's the only limitation; you may not be inclined to try them all. You'll need to shop at an Asian grocery store for ingredients, but in a pinch, I've made successful substitutions (like for fermented black beans). Highly recommended!"
4,Good recipes.,This is your basic good solid homey dishes. Recipes are easy to follow and not complicated.
4,Good Chinese cooking book,"My wife and I came from Hong Kong a LONG time ago and we miss a lot of the Chinese dishes. We found most of them in this book and we had been using it quite often. The instruction is clear and dishes are relatively easy to make. However, I would like to see more pictures (of the final product and the preperation steps) in the next edition. We like the book so much that we purchased multiple copies as gifts to friends.Highly recommended. If there are more pictures, I will give it a 5."
5,Great Book!,This book series would make a GREAT movie series! Seriously; it would be awsome to watch. The destruction of Atlantis- That would be GREAT! You people would make TONS of money off of this if you made these books into a series.
5,An Impressive Novel,"This is a fabulous novel! The prose is excellent - a unique amalgamation of Arthurian legend. As for historical accuracy, I would have to second the observation that the Arthurian legend has ALWAYS been a story. It is a legend that has evolved from myth. Every retelling expands and interprets the story. That's how myths and legends develop in the first place. It doesn't matter that Plato placed Atlantis millenia before Arthur, or that Taliesin was centuries after (both of which are also stories). It's a story - and a good one at that!"
2,Depends on what you're looking for....,"The story is well-written and the characters are endearing, but...Taliesin journeys to the Otherworld and finds there... the White God? Seriously?! The most legendary Druid Bard who ever lived (maybe?) turned into the World's First Evangelical Christian was very painful to witness. And the light hand with history was also cringe-worthy. If you have only the most cursory interest in and knowledge about Celtic history, Druids, the Atlantis myth, the Cymry people, Wales, and the Arthurian Legend, you may enjoy this book. But if you are interested in these subjects and know a thing or two about them, this book will probably deeply hurt you.All that said... there are some passages which are beautifully crafted and quote-worthy. Just... not the ones which have anything to do with the spiritual path of the world's most famous Druids (whether myth or real) or history even in the lightest concept."
1,Not based on accurate historical information,"This was the first and only book of Stephen Lawhead I've read. It's also my last. As a pantheist and druid, I find Taliesin's conversion to christianity offensive. The early christian church has already stolen and corrupted most of the pagan gods and holidays, now the author is trying to take Taliesin. Read this book only if you want a diffused, rambling story with no hint of real historical facts"
1,"Not just Bad, but offensive as well.","I was not expecting to be blown away by this book, but I was also not expecting to have my time wasted with Christian Romantasy. Taliesin, one of the most ancient and powerful figures in Celtic and British Myth,a converted Christian?! The idea is patently absurd. I could go on, but this kind of tripe makes my head hurt to even think about."
5,"""Taliesin"" is simply my favorite book.","""Taliesin"" is my favorite book I've ever read and I am a Literature major at Cambridge. That should tell you somthing. It has strong-points in every field that make a piece of writing a classic: great characters,rich plot that will keep you reading for hours,intense drama,and a tour of a world so beautiful, only an author like Lawhead could create it."
2,Story without a plot,"Could be a good story, but the excessive detail drags the whole book down. There is no real central issue which the book revolves around; just following the lives and experiences of various characters. The whole third section of the book seems to be devoted to a Christian agenda. Followers of Calvin converting Merlin to Christianity? Long exposes on the meaning of the 'one true god.' Now Taliesin refers to others as Pagans. Seems to be the central motif of the later part of this book. Many much better fantasy novels revolving around these characters."
2,A puzzling disappointment,"Lawhead is undeniably a good talespinner, but this was too much fantasy and too little Arthurian Britain. The technique of placing Atlantis, said by Plato to have sunk around 9,000 BC, to be contemporary with 5th Century AD Britain, is just too preposterous to stand up. The character of Taliesin is superficial, nowhere near as fleshed out as that of Charis, his wife. It was not quite straightforward fantasy, not quite historical fiction, and the saintly characterizations of the Christians (nothing is said about the darker aspects of exterminating paganism) was too sugary. I expected better from Lawhead."
5,Unique Read,"I will make this review brief. If you are looking for something well written, thought-out and with a unique idea to an old story.. check this out. It will please you."
3,A good read,"This book was hard for me to get into at first. There was a lot of made-up language to get used to. But once I picked up on the terms (or learned what I could ignore and still understand the story), the book got much better. Normally, I would have given up on a book five chapters in if I didn't like it but I was stuck in a sick bed for a couple of days and so kept reading. I'm glad I did. I wound up staying up way past my normal bedtime to finish this book and cried like my own heart got broken at the very end."
1,Not for Me,"A decent read, one that I was enjoying, until it got REALLY preachy about 2/3 of the way through the book. I picked the book up knowing the the author was a Christian, and it didn't stop me: I'd be a fool and a biggot to choose not to read a book based solely on the author's beliefs...but then he started to cram those beliefs down my throat. And THAT'S when I put the book down, unfinished, never to pick it up again. To quote Homer Simpson:""Awwww...this isn't about *Jesus* is it?""Sorry Homer, I'm afraid it is."
3,OK,I much prefer the audiobooks on CDs over this that you need an MP3 attachment.. They are much simpler to operate. They automatically find the start and stop place in a vihicle.
1,Silliest Arthurian book ever written,"Having read previous reviwes, I noticed that some disapproved of Taliesin (Merlin, Arthur etc.) being made christians because of their own religious belived. I am myself a christian, but I am also a welsh-speaker who finds the celtic history and culture being ridiculed in this book. Lawhead wants us to believe that Atlantis had anything to do with King Arthur and Celtic Britain, a time-gap of almost 5.000 years, he says that Germanic tribes LIBERATED Britain from the Romans! The Romans had left long before these Germanic tribes enslaved Britain. King Arthur and Merlin is Mr. Lawhead's way of making cheap money out of a subject that he is totaly unaware of."
2,Poor history,"Although the story of Charis and Taliesin is an interesting one, and reasonably well written, I could not finish the book. Lawhead places Atlantis at the same time the Romans are occupying Britain. Plato (b. c. 427 b.c.e.) spoke of Atlantis being an ancient city and other authors have placed Atlantis about the same time as the Minoans (c. 1500 b.c.e.). The Roman occupation of Britain started with Julius Caesar (55-54 b.c.e). These two are not contemporaneous. I much prefer my historical fiction to be reasonably historical."
1,Worst book ever,"This was AWFUL. The first two thirds were entertaining. But in the third section, just when Taliesin was starting to get awesome, he becomes a Christian which apparently is equivalent to being boring and one dimensional. I'm a Christian, so when i read this portion of the book it thoroughly disappointed me. Lawhead could have provided an entertaining story but instead he decided that he wanted to provide an uninspired and uninteresting ending to an otherwise good story. What a waste. Don't but this book. If you REALLY want to read it just borrow it from the library or borrow it from a friend who made the mistake of buying it. I got it at a yard sale; i wish i had spent my quarter on just about anything else."
1,Poorly written piece of tripe...,"...unless you are a charismatic Christian whocannot open a novel unless it somehow involvesthe greatness and correctness of Christianity.I slogged through page after page of overdescriptiveprose (hint to aspiring writers: writing at lengthabout someone's boredom is boring) only to have itdawn on me that the whole work is just a set up forlots of misguided pagans to discover the True Way.I love and respect the works of CS Lewis. I don'thave a problem with Christian fiction. I haveno problem with writers expressing their world view--that's the whole point of writing. But for God's sake(really), don't be dishonest about it."
2,Couldn't finish it,Had no clue what was going on. The book moved too slow for me but the details on scenery was excellent if only the author stepped up some of the other parts of the book I would have liked it more
4,Interesting story line,"I enjoyed this book!It was a little out of my range as I enjoy Merlin/Arthur books. This was first so I got it. You do need to read it, to know whats up later. Still reading the other books,new and different story line for me,enjoyable any way."
5,Can't get enough of Lawhead's books!,"This is the first book I read of Stephen Lawhead. And I couldn't put it down! Taking you back into a different era where life was rich and slow (not a ratrace), and vibrant and exciting, it is really difficult to believe you're in this boring age of the 21st century! While reading the book I could easily envision exactly what the countryside looked like. I was living through the characters' eyes, ears and touch. I was THERE! I have now completed a third series of Lawhead's books. My husband has declared that he has become a book widower! :)"
2,"Yet another Arthurian series - this one is BAD, though","I'm not impressed. Not even amused. To make books about Arthur and Merlin seems to be a safe way to print money. Well, this author won't get any more of my money. Trying to make the Merlin a christian, and breaking with historical facts on almost every page (Arthur eating potatoes made me laugh out loud - potatoes came to Englad from America a millennium later than this time frame). It clearly shines through that Lawhead is a christian author who wants to accomplish two things - make money, and jam his beliefs down your throat. Avoid, unless you're just out for a good laugh at the expense of a bad author."
2,A Good Story Ruined,"I love Arthurian lore, especially anything having to do with Merlin. In this book you get a look into where Merlin came from. Unfortunately it falls into the trap of so many others. Merlin came from a Pagan background. This book, like so many others throws Christianity into the mix and it ruins the story. Arthur was great because he was taught by Merlin outside of the context of present society. I was very disappointed with this telling of the story."
2,Not As Good As Being There...,"I've seen The Stylistics in concert twice within the last two years (Valentine's Day tours) and was very pleased with both their performances (NYC & Rochester, NY). This DVD left me a little 'flat'. It seemed to me that they were just going through the motions and that certain intangible quality in the lead singer's voice appeared to be missing. Although both times, I had seats that were not considered the best, the live performances I attended had a ""presence"" to them that was undeniable. The video quality is okay.The ""interviews"" on the disc were more enjoyable for me than the concert footage was. but oh well... it was still good to pop it in and try to relive the moment once again."
5,"Mystical, magical and .... amazing.","No matter what your musical tastes or prime sonic genre, you will find much to explore and love in this 2 disc set ... IMO, the best of of AV ... listen to this music ASAP!"
5,Classic,"This is the Vollenweider that many of us fell in love with back in the '80s. I had most of these pieces on cassette, and I like the convenience of having them on one CD set. And the pieces in this collection that I missed the first time around made me feel like I was discovering buried treasure. For anyone who is just now discovering the unique aesthetic richness and limitless imagination of Vollenweider's music, this is a good place to start."

4,Great Book,"I was looking for an ABC's book that had realistic pitures in it that the kids could identify from objects around the house. This book worked out great. They already eat most of the foods pictured and if they didn't recognize it, it was a good way to introduce that food. I would recommend this book."
3,Big DC continuity flaw...,"The Kents is basically a pastiche of Civil War-era history, a name-dropping who's who that also tries to achieve the scope of The Sacketts. Tim Truman's artwork is great as always (his Bloody Bill Anderson and young Jesse James are both easily worth the cover price). In fact, the only problem I have with the series is its representation of Jonah Hex; he received the scar on the right side of his face AFTER the Civil War, when he returned to the tribe of Apaches with whom he had spent the latter part of his childhood."
3,tactical shorts,well made correct sizing but not crazy about buttun fly ample pockets adjustable waist comfortable fit good leg length well made
2,Need base Keyboard not what I thought,The concept is great. BUT you have to buy the base keyboard which costs $40 plus. I see in most reviews this does not work as well as expected. Too many problems. Just returned for full refund.
4,would recommend,"does what it says it was. great if your a wow fan. got this for my husband as a gift, he loves it. before you buy this item you need to get the zboard ultimat gaming board.(the base)"
2,I am sure some like it,I didnt like the key layout of this for my play style. if your a left hound mouse right hand keyboard which I have never met one maybe you will enjoy this but I like the old plain zboard set better.
1,This Keyset wont enable,I have been trying to get this keyset to work in my Zboard and it wont enable i have contacted the ideazon company and they just give me a run around with emails since they dont have a phone number to call.........the keyset looks absolutely awesome and i really wish that it would work.......I am thinking of ordering another one......Just because it looks like it would enhance the game play of WoW.
2,doesnt seem to work with PS/2 version of keyboard,Even with updated drives this keyset was onrecognized on the PS/2 version of the Z-Board.
1,NOT RECEIVED IN 3 MONTHS,"I ordered this item November 7, 2006 and still haven't received it, as of February 20 2007. I keep getting emails saying that it's been postponed over and over. I called Amazon and they don't know anything. Be prepared to wait a veryyyy long time! If this item ever comes maybe I can write a review. Until then, I am waiting for an explanation from Amazon as to why this item is not being shipped."
3,Does the keyset make a big difference in play?,"I purchased the keyset only to make the mistake that I thought the Z-Board came with the keyset. Two very different items, please make sure if purchasing seperately that you purchase the keyboard first. That being said, the keyset is easy to use and does help gameplay to some extent. I've become addicted to World of Warcraft much to my wife's chagrin, but she understands my need to escape mundania. What I've noticed from using the ketset exculsively is that while it does help to have pre-set keys you don't have to absolutely need this to improve your gameplay. It's a nice thing to have but not a nessecity like I thought. Some folks might be better off staying with the traditional keyboard."
3,you don't really need this,"I've been an avid WOW player for several years. We bought this hoping for some advantage. It's kind of nice to have some of the macro setup that this board offers but the first time it got unplugged from the PC during a cleaning session the damn thing never worked right again. Must have caused an ESD and fried the electronics in it.Before that I found I still had the built in reflex actions from a regular keyboard and I just simply kept playing the way I had so the macro advantage was wasted.I did replace it with the Logitech G15 board and it just plainly blows this board away. Best board I've ever used.Don't buy this if you can afford the G15, besides there's an addon for the G15 that makes thing even easier if you get the hang of it."
4,Helpful info. on these different mushrooms,I thought this book was interesting but would have liked more info. on how to get these mushrooms and the legality issues of ordering from overseas and growing them in the US. It's a starting point.
1,Not much help,"i bought this book in hopes of getting a better understanding of mushrooms. this book failed miserably. it was some what interesting. but not useful for any type of research, or growing techniques."
2,Adjustable Sawhorse,"Very flimsey packaging, arrived broken but usable. It works fine but too much light plastic."
3,Stanley sawhorses,I needed something to be able to quickly set up a worksurface on and be able to adjust the height. Plus take up as little space as possible when not in use. These were poorly packed and a piece of plastic had broken off during shipment but shouldn't affect their performance. Don't know yet if they will hold up to hard use for very long yet. Very disappointed in a product with the Stanley name on it! Would not reccomend these and have since found much better horses.
3,Stanley Sawhorse,"I love these sawhorses and I would have given them a higher rating if they were made tougher and had written instuctions. Because I didn't read the pictures correctly (no written instructions) I ended up putting a crack in one of the lower support beams when I tried to raise (force) the sawhorse to a height that I needed at that moment. Had I known that you need to close the sawhorse first and than change the height I could have avoided that. Even so, the sawhorses survived me and still work great. They store great, are light and will probably outlive me. :-)"
3,"Good but no additional ""v-grooves"" available!","Important to be able to clamp and cut lumber on the sawhorse. The included v-groove attacments make this partially possible. I say partially because while one can put a standard 2x4 across the top of one saw horse using the included brackets, you can't replicate this on the other sawhorse of a pair because only one set of ""smart v-groove"" attachments - enough for only one saw horse - is included in the twin packStanley 60622 Folding Adjustable Sawhorse Twin Pack. I have attempted to find somewhere to buy another set of v-groove attachments but no such luck. All US dealers I have been able to locate thru search, including Amazon, stock only the saw horse twin pack itself and not the attachments seperately (found a UK dealer that does). This greatly reduces the usefulness - otherwise would have given 5 stars."
4,Great Sawhorse but only $50 at Local Home Depot,"I really like these sawhorses. Great for the type of work that I do. But, I was pleasantly surprised to find them on sale ($10 off) at the local Home Depot for a total of $50 plus tax.Be careful when pulling up the top rest. I held the bottom cross piece down with my foot and the unit was cold and the plastic piece broke off in two pieces. In fairness, I had my foot on only one cross piece. Better to place foot on two cross pieces at the same time. In looking at the break area, I concluded the design is weak and prone to breakage unless you are very careful.I shall repair it with epoxy and aluminum."
4,Love that they're height adjustable!,"... I just wish it had been a little more self-evident how to adjust the height. I had a real duh moment when I was setting them up the first time, but once I figured out that you had to close them to adjust the height, it was all good."
5,Great sawhorses,Great sawhorses. We've set them up with a top to use as a table for a table saw. We've put a dresser on the sawhorses for easy refinishing/painting. They break down easily for storage. They are sturdy enough for all projects that we've needed them for. Very happy with this product!
5,A very practical product,"Lightweight, storable, sturdy and space saving. This practical tool gives plenty of options for the ""do it yourselfer."" Making the old sawhorse practically obsolete, this adjustable equiptment tames the most unruly job putting your work right where you need it and not forcing you to work on ""its"" level."
4,Great Sawhorses,Great product for the price. Product arrived in great condition. My husband has already used them several times. He likes the adjustability of this set. They fold nicely for storage.
3,Pretentious,"I consider myself a huge fan of Pink Floyd, but this book was not interesting at all. Phil Rose takes it upon himself to talk about the meaning of specific notes and patterns in the songs. For example (paraphrased) it went from B to G, and although the listener expects the D it just goes back to the B. I suppose some might be interested in this, but it's not for me. I want to read about what the album means, and although he does go into this I would have to imagine there are better books out there for this purpose."
4,a lot of insight,"If you're interested in an intelligent discussion of Pink Floyd's concept albums, this is a great read. One negative about this book is how SMALL the actual book is. Another is that the author got some input from Roger Waters, but evidently not all that much input. Still, it does a good job of pulling from many other sources AND contributing original insights."
1,This item stinks,"We bought this thinking it would be as much fun as the web shooting glove. Boy were we wrong. First of all it doesn't even blow bubbles. We tried three different brands of bubbles to see if we could get it to work. They say it has a resevoir to catch the over spillage. That is not true. This thing leaks bubble solution all over the place. I have a six year old and he had bubble solution all over the place. It is really messy and no fun at ALL. The thing costs over $10 and is not worth $1. It looks well made, but does not work."
1,It didn't work,"We got this home from the store, installed new batteries, and followed all the instructions and used the bubble solution that came with it. It barely works at all. We got maybe 10 bubble out of it before the new batteries started to run down, and dripped bubble solution all over my son's arm. It's going straight back to the store."
2,It Would Be Fun If It Would Work!,I have to agree with the other reviews... This toy is a mess! Leaky bubble solution everywhere with only intermittant bubble shooting. My boys were SO excited to try this... and they still have fun PRETENDING to shoot webs/bubbles but the toy just doesn't work. Disappointing!
1,Doesn't work AT ALL,"My 4 year old son just received this toy for his birthday and could not wait to try it out. I spent half an hour trying to get the stupid thing to work, spilled bubble solution all over the place, and got nowhere. Never saw a SINGLE BUBBLE!!"
2,You get what you pay for,This flag is so thin that in the sun you can see right through it.Would not buy again and return cost was approximately the same as the flag cost..
5,Surprisingly Good Picture - Rivals my HD TV,"Right out the box, this TV has a gorgeous picture and for this model number there is a similiar review @ Epinions.No overscanned jagged edges, skin tones are correct.True black rendering is very good.Menu for the TV is dead easy.Meijer stores,Ohio ran an ad last weekand took $50 off which dropped the price to ** $175.00 **Best thing I could find with a Digital Comb Filter under $200 was Samsung TXR2035 or the Toshiba 20AF45, both 20"" sets.This JVC has the digital comb filter, 600 lines of resolution, sound leveling (so the commercials don't yell at you)and several display and sound options and component inputs.We intended to tweak skin tones, color intensity, and true black. We have video sample that we use for that.There was nothing for us to do, right out of the box, this picture was great, period."
3,"Work great, but spring rusted","These work as advertised, however, on one of them, the spring that causes the lever to return to the unbraked position as rusted. If you live in a high-humidity environment as I do, this is something to consider."
5,shore stop,i love my road bikes but had truble stoping. now with the tektro 720 brake lever i dont have to lean over to stop the bike thay work very well and are a snap to install and most of all it is a matter of safety and comfort while on the road.
2,refurbish diamond blade,"This is not a new blade, refurbisg with uneven teeth! Garbage.. too rough to cut and shaking."
1,"A fun idea, but nothing more","Writers who are insightful and entertaining elsewhere, like Virginia Heffernan and Nick Hornsby, are dull and pointless here. Susan Cheever gives us yet another picture of her famous father as a stuffy suburban drunk. Nora Ephron likes Mary Tyler Moore because it made her feel better about being a single woman. So what? ""Why did you like Gilligan's Island"" is not an inherently interesting question- quite the opposite. It would take real talent to make something nourishing out of these bones. And, although the resumes of these writers indicated that the necessary talent had been assembled, the product demonstrated otherwise"
4,Solidly interesting; not the usual fluff,"Plenty of travel videos might as well be written by the local chamber of commerce, with no depth and way too many superlatives. This video, put together by The Learning Channel, is quite different. It doesn't simply show the castles, but explains the historical context in which they were important. There's also plenty of anecdotes, such as the minor ""miracle"" that caused the Marksburg on the Rhine to be so named.If you're planning a trip to any of these areas, watching this video will both show you the region and give you some background with which to appreciate it."
2,What do you know?,"Your editorial review said: ""Then, on Wallachia [...] better known as Transylvania"". That's like saying: Nevada, better known as California. Romania had three major provinces: Moldavia was the third one. Vlad Tepes/ Vlad The Impaler/ Dracula ruled in Wallachia. However, he was born in Transylvania."
5,Excellent record,"These guys really gel with one another. Excellent mix of standards and originals. Of the originals, I especially like Peru, in which Kreisberg plays a McLaughlin-esque outro. His playing is passionate and forceful throughout. And the organ sounds provided by Versace make for an overall unique listening experience. If you like organ trios you won't be disappointed with this album."
3,Feel a little cheated,"I'm not sure how to feel about this. I suppose it is my fault for not looking into the fact that Rothco is a distributor and not a brand.I received a grabber all weather blanket. My issue is that I saw the same product for $4.00 less advertised honestly as a grabber all weather blanket and it too was an Amazon prime eligible item.So.. while I guess I am not knocking the product, I can't help but feel I was cheated out of some money on this one."
5,Reflective blankets,"Okay, I haven't used these yet, but I bought them to cover the tent ends of my pop-up trailer, to help deflect the Texas sun and keept it cooler. Could have used them last month, but I forgot I bought them...LOL! Will use them next time..."
4,Realistic,"Its well worth the money. Very realistic and sets a nice atmosphere, but when I turn it loud enough to hear the background crickets and birds, some of the loon calls in the foreground are overpowering (much louder than the ones in the sample). It sounds like a couple of them were right by the microphone. There is also almost no water sounds, just birds, crickets and frogs. I am glad I bought it, but would find it difficult to fall asleep to. I will play it in the morning to help wake me up and to help me relax."
2,A bunch of bull...,"The first third of the album is fine. As another reviewer pointed out the balance between the loons in the foreground and the other bird calls in the background isn't perfect but that's probably nitpicking. What ultimately ruins this CD is the bullfrog that pipes up 20 minutes into it. After that it's the bullfrog show (it's either a bullfrog or a cow giving birth to a hippo, I'm not sure) and this bullfrog sounds like it's croaking into a bull horn that's bungeed to your head and cranked up to 11. Alright, maybe it's not that bad but it's certainly not relaxing. The good news is I only wasted $5 on it."
4,Good value for the money,"Well made watch. Robust, a bit on the shiny side. Bracelet could be sturdier. At this price it is money very well spent."
2,"Beautiful Watch, But Broke in 3 days","I read a lot of the reviews for this watch, and for the people who wrote good reviews of this watch sold me on what a great value this watch was. This watch looks like it cost five times more, but . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .But after wearing this watch for the third time Button A broke. Now I know why they are selling this watch at such a discount. This Invicta 9223 Speedway watch is not made with quality components/craftsmanship. Luckily I kept the original box it came in, and I returned it. I don't think I'll ever try to buy another Invicta watch again."
3,"heavy case, nice dial, cheap bracelet","This thing has got some weight to it, but it is not uncomfortable to wear. Band is a very cheap, lightweight, rattly, hair-pulling mess, but the finish on it is decent. Keeps good time, and the chronograph functions work as advertised. For the money, it is heavy and shiny and keeps good time."
3,Caveat Emptor,"Just a note to encourage anyone thinking of buying an Invicta to research the brand first. Great value, great-looking watches... BUT, they have a reputation among owners and dealers of wildly variable quality... some are nearly perfect, some fail catastrophically, and some just can't keep time. Still, you might get a good one and be thrilled! Good luck!!!"
3,invicta watch review,Nice watch but the face felt a bit smaller then the average mans watch which I didn't like an also the watch felt a little cheap in my hands which I was turned off about also. I can't say it was a bad watch but it just wasn't for me.
2,Poorly made,"Pros:1. Good-looking, ultra shiny watch with a tachymeter (not that I would ever need to use one outside of a racetrack)2. It keeps time, although not as precise as would be expected of a quartz watch3. Returning it was fairly simpleCons:1. Second dial does not align with second marks2. Chronograph does not work... at all!3. Heavy watch"
5,Really proud of this watch.,"It's really a nice looking watch, people complement it when ever they notice it. For the fractions of a Rolex or a Omega you get a really nice watch with quality to match. I just love this watch, Fantastic!"
5,Great watch with reasonable price tag,"Actually this is my first time shopping with amazon.com. It's amazing cause shipping to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia took less than a week. The packaging is so nice and secure that almost impossible to get any damage caused by the courier service. Great discount by Invicta-Amazon and fast delivery is the main selling point here than buying at local watch shop. In terms of quality and design, this model is great. Suitable for daily wear, not too big or heavy. Fits just nice on me. Definitely will consider to shop again from here."
2,Too small for my Taste,This is a very nice watch for those of you that don't like big face watches..Really good looking watch but too small for my taste.. I didn't have the size chart before i ordered it.. I returned it!
5,Exquisite watch!,"Wow! This watch is absolutely beautiful. It is packaged in a great yellow box and as soon as you take the watch out of the box, your just amazed by the look and feel. I bought this for my husband for Valentine's Day, unsure if he would like it as he is very picky about gifts, especially watches, and he loved it. We actually took it to a jeweler to get a couple of links taken out for him and the jeweler told us it looked exactly like a Rolex Daytona and wanted to know where I bought it because Invicta's are so hard to find. It truly is a wonderful watch."
4,"excellent, very good locking watch","Very nice watch, very beuatifull and extremely good locking, really an eye catcher, but this watch is a quartz chronograph watch and it's don't cont tenth of seconds, and the second hand don't walk exactly over the little second mark lines. After all at this price it's very recommended product."
1,Watch died after 1 week,I have purchased several items on Amazon and this is the first item I have ever had to return. After I had the watch for about 3 days I noticed that it was losing time. I would reset the time and it would be ok for awhile but on about the 5th day it stopped working all together. I'm assuming that the battery died. You would think that Invicta would check these things before they shipped a watch. Also the case for the watch was pretty dirty so who knows how long this was in the warehouse before they shipped it. I was very dissapointed and I will not be purchasing this brand again.
1,Invicta Speedway Collection from Amazon,"I generally don't check for the watches in the shop before placing an order over net. This is perhaps the trust i have built over time on WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get). but it is different in case of this watch. In yor first glance you can figureout that the design is little different from what you see in the picture; which is disappointing. I would have still given it a 3 rating if this was the only issue. But there is one more added to it, the chronograph doesn't workproperly.After complete disappointment with the purchase, I'm down rating it! It is possible that your experience might be good with same model watch if what you see is what you get!"
5,Great product!,I gave this as a gift to my in-laws. They had seen these chairs at another relative's house and used them there. We were looking everywhere for the ones they had seen as none of the other ones seemed to measure up. Now our search has been successful! Thanks!
4,Satisfied,"I friend of mine had a couple of these lounges, so I knew what to expect before it arrived. I am pleased with the comfort of the lounge chair. My only complaints are that it is a little on the heavy side for a travel recliner, I pinched my finger under the armrest while adjusting the recliner, and the drink tray is designed to fit only on the right side of the chair. At the price I paid ($90 which included shipping), it is a little on the high side, but I'm hoping that the quality (Bliss) that it will be worth the extra money."
1,GREAT -until it fell apart!,"Well we loved this chair, used it on the porch, at the beach. First off, the snack tray broke off -ok not a big lost, still enjoyed the chair. Then one day my husband sat in the chair and went to recline and it literally broke-he fell back on his back and head. Fortunately he didn't get really hurt. This was returned. Thank you for the good customer service Amazon!"
5,Box battered but chair intact !,"I cannot understand why no operating instructions are not included. The chair is comfortable and though I have not yet figured how the 'wing things' under the arm rests work, I only knew about them because of the reviews by other purchasers. The chair is comfortable and for an indoor/outdoor chair looks pretty good."
2,Arrived damaged,Purchased arrived damaged. Chair seems nice but bought two and one is broken and they are now out of stock. and will be a hassle to return because they are so bulky
3,"LOVE Jon Faddis, not this album","I am a HUGE Faddis fan but this one is not my favorite. Though the album shows a great versatility of his playing style and genres it lacks the raw emotion that comes from some of his other albums. It was also more of a contemporary or a ""smoothe jazz"" feel rather than the old school feel of his other albums. Props for breaking away from the norm, that's what the 3 stars are for. One of the tracks has talking and another track is so foolish that I don't even include it im my playlists."
4,"Fine book , typical of the ""Using.."" line from Que","Pretty much what the book description (above) claims it to be, but probably not quite as ""clear and concise"".The beginning/intermeidiate user could do a lot worse."
3,wheres everlong?,"Hey its a good album. Damn good , but for the life of me cant figure out where half of the songs are. during the movie there is a scene where Nikky is climbing a ladder to see a girl. Ok there you hear the almighty foo fighters doing an acustic Everlong.. sexellent version by the way.. but where the hell is this song? how can i get my hands on this version? Highway to hell? also not on the soundtrack.. left me real confused!"
4,Missing songs,I've bought these CD. Great stuff. Unfortunately there are some songs from the movie which are not on the CD. When Little Nicky is climbing up the ladder to see his girl he's looking inside a dorm seeing that crazy guy wearing woman's clothes. In the background you hear that song I'm looking for. What's the name of these song?
3,This ...,You know if the peolple are going to make a soundtrack then they should include all the songs that had a part in it like Van Halens song (Running with the Devil) and Ozzy's two songs (No More Tears) and (Mama.I'm Coming Home)But other than that it is Ok if you don't care for those people
4,great condition,"Item arrived in great condition, not a scratch on it. Was kinda disappointed that the main songs I liked weren't on the CD.The movies opening theme ""Runnin with the Devil"" wasn't even on the soundtrack. That was a bummer."
3,Is this the right CD???,"I saw the movie (which was funny, yet harmful to non-christians and people who dont know who/what God is)But anyway, the songs in the vid were good, but when I went to get the CD it didn't have all the good stuff on it! The songs on it are good, but it was lacking therefore it was a dissappointment."
5,One (pardon the joke) hell of a good CD,"Well, to tell the truth, i dont own this CD, but I have seen the movie, and that counts (i think). Anyhow, at the very beginning, they were playing this really cool song, and i thought to myself, wow, this is a really cool song. then all throughout the movie, I heard songs that I also really like, such as Incubus's Pardon me, and powerman 500's when worlds collide. To tell the truth, the other songs i haven't heard of, except for the deftones who i dont really like, but i know they must be good, cuz i liked every song that they played in the movie, except for that minute of BBMak, which i didn't. so if you're into alternative or hardcore, this CD rox. it really does. So does the movie. see that too. It was very funny."
4,Back when the BBs could be considered progressive rock,"Legend has it that the BBs peaked as a live act in the early to mid 1970s, when they would sprinkle selections from SUNFLOWER and HOLLAND with obscure gems from PET SOUNDS and WILD HONEY, with only a few of the greatest hits that would, after 1974, doom the band to being strictly an oldies act. The strengths here are, in fact, the grit and gusto given lesser known tracks like ""Sail on Sailor,"" ""The Trader,"" and ""Marcella,"" of all which feel loose and---dare I say?---funky ... not a word oft associated with this much-stereotyped group."
3,Live and let live,"This Beach Boys concert album was recorded at various venues during their Winter 1972 Tour and their Summer 1973 Tour. This was during the brief time period that Bruce Johnston had quit the band, and was replaced by South African musicians Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar. The performances here are good, but none of them match the studio versions of these songs. On the plus side, this was before the Beach Boys became a nostalgia act that just played their biggest hits. So, we are treated to some rare live versions of lesser known songs like ""Sail On Sailor"", ""Trader"", ""You Still Believe in Me"" and ""Funky Pretty"". I wouldn't say this is an essential Beach Boys CD, but it should be of interest to most of their fans."
4,Political Beach Boys,"This is a great live album. As a matter of fact, all three of the BBs albums are good and worth owning because they're representative of three quite different eras. My only problem with this one is that the only time you hear Dennis is when he's talking to the audience. I also wouldn't have minded an inclusion of the Blondie Chaplin-sung version of 'Wild Honey', which was supposedly a great highlight of this incarnation of the Beach Boys' shows. To anyone who doesn't like 'We Got Love': listen closely to the lyrics, and then think about who wrote the song and where they're from. As far as i'm conerned, this album contains a Beach Boys song about - apartheid! And an absolutely rockin' one at that! Yes, the Beach Boys were a great band, weren't they?"
2,where's brian,"This concert features a few good tracks, however Brian Wilson must have been lyin in bed when this concert was recorded. How can the BBs perform surfer girl and good vibrations without Brian? Your better off with the good timing(live in England) audio CD which features all 3 Wilson brothers and the original Beach Boys. Most tracks on this album are dull and lack the usual good feeling beach boys vibe. I listened to it a few times when I first got it and probably wont listen to it again."
1,Horrible!,"This is the worst live album I've ever heard. Period. Even worse than ""Dylan and the Dead."" No crowd noise, no Dennis, and terrible arrangements of great songs. I love the Boys, but this is not their finest hour. Al's lead vocal on ""Don't Worry Baby"" sounds like he's choking on a large ice cube or something. The other vocals arent much better either. An awful, awful CD which is to be avoided at all costs except for completists."
2,not worth its cost,"Thought i was getting a steal on this when I saw it at sears for 20 bucks. Now though, I'm sorry i bought it. When they listed this as a drill, as apposed to a drill/driver, they weren't kidding; This drills low end torque is terrible: any attempt to drive an piloted screw will, at best, result in the drill stalling, and, when you increase the power, instantly stripping the screw.Unless you plan on using a second tool for driving, do your self a favor and look elsewhere."
5,Great drill,"Lasted 12 years for me. Replaced the chuck once instead of buying a new drill. I beat on this thing, using it for purposes that it was never designed for, smoking the brushes on multiple occasions (need a bigger drill to stir thin set mortar, but this powered through!). Finally died yesterday and I'm a bit sad. If I had a shelf for dead tools that served me well, this would take front and center."
4,Durable & Tasteful,"Needed a decent watch that could stand up to rough use. Most of the Timex expedition or adventure series watches are great when it comes to durability, and I happened to like the look of this one. The green-brown leather strap is durable, but it's got a kinda weird ""spotted?"" pattern on part of it. Only real negative is the watch face is rather wide - so my hand can easily turn the backlight on by accident. Still a great watch for a great price."
3,Railroad Tycoon,This product was received with no problems and had no defects noted. I had installed this program with OS windows 7 pro. In general the game has played well.
5,RAILROAD TYCOON 3 RULES,"I bought this game on my birthday when i was playing this gameIT WAS A VERY GOOD GAME you can choose the year you want itto be,what country in the world,the trains look amazing,game speed is just good,the best mode you can choose isthe sandbox,scenario,and campaign is okaythis game is playable"
2,Didn't like as much a RT2,"I had a hard time with this game, after playing RT2 to death, which I loved....couldn't easily grasp the differences and frankly didn't have the time anymore to learn the nuances....I've moved on to Sid Meir's (original creator of RT) Civilization III."
3,Choo Choo,"I bought this game for my husband for his birthday when it first came out. My husband loved RRT 2 and the expansion pack, so I thought this was a definite can't lose gift. And it wasn't. The graphics are great, the music is fun, and the ability to play online is great. (Not too many play online yet though, for some reason)However, my husband who spent much of his life playing the previous game did not spend nearly as much time on this one. He says that he enjoys it, but I can tell that the thrill of this game is just not what it normally should be. I've tried playing it, and I know my husband misses micromanaging everything. It's become rather simplistic and much more about the stock market instead of the railroads themselves."
1,The game stinks,"I loved Railroad Tycoon 2, but I absolutely despise Railroad Tycoon 3. The graphics have been greatly improved, but that is the only positive thing I can say about the game."
1,third party copy,"The disks I received are not from PopTop. Instead it's by ""SoldOut Software"". When trying to install, it wants to install a bunch of unrelated stuff, but doesn't want to install the game itself. Took a lot of effort to figure out what's going on and had to go directly into the lower directory which contained the original game to install manually. Then when starting it, if using the ""play"" disk in the drive, it plays a music and display a title page, then complain about wrong disk. If using the ""install"" disk, it complains about an configuration issue. Finally got it barely to work after reinstalling it several times in different ways. Turns out the ""install"" disk is the one to use during play.This package is totally screwed up. Not worth the risk. Who knows what other junk like virus and spyware may be included? The game is not as interesting as RT2 either. For a lot of maps, it limits to only 1 AI player."
1,RT3 might be fun if I could get it to load.,"It shouldn't be that difficult to load. Who knows if it's fun or not. I shouldn't have to fiddle around with drivers or any other files to get it to run. I'm extremely dissapointed even if I didn't spend a lot. It doesn't earn any stars with me. If anyone out there has any suggestions, I'm open to them."
3,"Great game, but not a simulation.","I have enjoyed playing this game for what it is worth, but it doesn't fullfill my sim needs. It is still a very enjoyable game but is definitely targeted to a broader audience, including children. There are a lot of very unrealistic things that happen while playing, such as trains going through each other and becoming invisible at stations (this is in the second RRtycoon as well) and trains moving WAY too fast, even if the game speed is lowered. It's pretty funny to watch a train going over 100mph go over a mountain in a couple seconds and somehow still be on the track.As far as the business part of it, it's definitely a simulation. Anything from using the stock market to running your opponent bankrupt will soothe the burn of the outdated graphics and whacked out physics if you are into business sims.I still recommend this game because of its very high replay value and the fact that it is just fun."
1,Not even close to the original,A Great Disappointment. As a huge fan of all the previous Railroad games I couldn't wait for #3 to come out. Good graphics and nothing else. They took a classic strategy game and made it into a boring sim.
4,More fun than RT2 and it's 3D now,"They have taken a lot of the busywork out of the game. You spend more time working on your routes than trying to micromanage the cars. You can manage down to the car level if you wish but game does pretty good job of matching up cargos. You can set the min/max cars per train per station. Overall play is pretty similar to II. 3D effects are really good, you can zoom down right into the trees and buildings. Great new feature, you can click on a train and ride along. Great to have a birds eye view of your train as it rolls. Worth the price of game by itself. I have spent quite a bit of time just watching... and not tending to the game. I think it is a solid improvement over RT2. Be careful, it's addicting."
1,"Stick with RR Tycoon 2, This Version Sucks.","I'm a BIG fan of the Railroad Tycoon franchise, having played all versions since and including the original RRT. I have spent many hours crafting railroad empires, accumulating vast fortunes and scheming to drive rivals into bankruptcy. It was therefore with much anticipation that I purchased version 3 and man was I ever disappointed! Graphically, it's a beautiful game. But it seems to me that gameplay was sacrificed for the sake of lovely pictures. It simply isn't as much fun to play version 3 as it is version 2.To be fair, I haven't played it all that much because I find the interface more difficult to use than RRT2. Maybe it will grow on me over time and, if so, I'll be happy to return and modify this review. But for now, I'm sticking with RRT2 as my game of choice over this one."
1,Don't be fooled!,"You may be thinking you should invest in your non-profit by paying the premium for the NonProfit Edition of Quickbooks. Well, Intuit has damaged their reputation by daring to call this a custom edition. They have slapped on a few screens and menus to serve the non-profit market but, unless you are a seasoned Quickbooks user you will be mired in numerous screens designed for the for-profit market, using irrelevant terminology. What's worse, they haven't even included appropriate non-profit terminology in many of their basic screens. Think the manual should help? No, they give you the manual for the for-profit version as well as a little guide to installing your non-profit version. If you are a non-profit and must use QuickBooks, think twice before paying the premium for the custom non-profit version."
1,this product is a joke--ftake it rom a CPA,forget the name--this is quickbooks in sheep's clothing. it has NOTHING to do with nonprofit accounting. either it's FASB compliant or its not. there's not one piece of changed functionality in here--they didn't even try! you might as well buy quickbooks and save [$$$] or check out...which is nonprofit specific add-on to quickbooks.
2,"Great looking watch, but need adjustments for accuracy","The watch is extremely handsome, looking much more expensive than it really is. It's hefty and sturdy, and is now my main daily wear watch. I would suggest buying it with a band resizing tool to save yourself some money and a trip to a watch store.The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that it came gaining about 20 seconds a day. Did some research, finding the maker of miyota movement inside this watch rates -20 to +40 sec a day within spec.update: January 2011. The watch stopped working. Almost exactly a year after the purchase the winding mechanism no longer works properly, so I would have to hand wind the watch daily. I'm no longer wearing it as it is not cost-effective to repair it. I'm taking the score down from 4 to 2 as a result. I guess spending $70 a year on a watch is not too expensive, but I rather spending $300 on a seiko and have it last 5-10 years."
1,only lasts one year,I thought that this watch was amazing for 365 days. This watch is now one year and one month old and the automatic movement has crapped out. The second hand doesn't go past the 25s mark unless you shake the watch quite vigorously. I looked into the warranty and seeing as the watch is over the year mark the warranty is over. I looked into the 4 year warranty but it was worth more than the watch. I guess when you see something that is to good to be true IE. a $315 watch for $75 it usually means it is. I contacted invicta and it will cost more than what i paid for the watch to have it repaired. Needless to say I am not happy and would not recommend this to anyone. I have over 20 watches and this is the first to die. It dies long before my cheap Timex and Kodiak watch from when i was a kid.
5,$4000 looking watch for $100,"An incredible watch couldn't get more for the price, the perfect watch for those who want the look of a $4000 watch but can't afford it. Brilliant Watch."
1,DOA.,"This is the second watch of this particular model I bought. The first one has been running great for the last two years and I had no hesitation in buying another one for my dad. Unfortunately, I realized something was wrong with this watch the moment I took it out of the box. All Automatic watches need a couple of turns of the winder to get them started. The winder on this one offered no resistance what so ever. That in itself was a clue to a bigger problem. Once the watch gets an initial wind, it supposed to be able to wind itself as you move around. This watch stopped within 5 minutes. I wore it for two days, trying to give it enough wind to keep it going, but it still stopped 30 minutes after I took it off.Since the first watch was/is running flawlessly, it's safe to assume that this is simply lack of manufacturer's quality control. Therefore, I will be ordering a replacement once my purchase has been refunded."
3,Does not keep time.,"I bought this watch for the apearance of the watch and for the convenience of never needing to replace the battery. Big mistake. The watch is consistently fast as much as 10 min./month. How convenient is it to reset the time weekly. If the main function of a watch is to give you some accurate idea of the time, then this watch fails miserably at that. It still looks good and is water resistant during dives. I guess you get what you pay for or maybe automatic watches are this inaccurate as a group."
5,Beautiful,"I have always wanted a very classy watch, actually I want the Rolex Blue Submariner but a little out of my budget. For the money you can not go wrong."
1,questionable quality,"I've never had this watch so much as in a bathtub and I have condensation on the inside of the Crystal. I have not been able to find someone who will do warranty on this product. And as if to put icing on the cake the watch run slow about 5 min. a day.Other than that I like to watch this durable, easy to read, and I don't have to put batteries in it."
4,great gift,Bought this for my husband for fathers day. Shipped when said it would and arrived in a nice yellow (leather?)case. My husband LOVES it. He had to take a few links out but thats not a big deal. Its actually realllllly nice quality. Had a price tag on it of $315!!! I got it for less than $100 so thats a GREAT deal!!
4,Super watch for the price.,"I own several watches, two of them Invicta's one a Black Face Professional Diver and the other a model that looks like a Rolex Yacht Master with rose gold face and bezel. Both to these are automatics and have been running well for over two years now.I recently splurged ($2K) and purchased a Tag Heuer Aquaracer Calibre 5 automatic that looks almost identical to this Invicta.I proudly wear the Tag daily, but if I am going some where a little gamey, I wear an Invicta, looks just as nice to the unknowning and if lost, stolen, broken, or taken in a robbery, it is no great loss.The only problem with the Invicta is the bracelet isn't 1/10th as nice as the real McCoy, and the power reserve is limited, I have to re-set and re-wind almost daily when waking up if I am wearing one, while the Tag will stay running for a day and a half when fully wound.Invictas are truly the King of the Throw Away watches!"
1,bad deal,"i went to the swiming pool , it get wed and the crown broke very easy , is not good cuality made from weakly metal , im not recommend at all."
1,Water Resistant is False,"my watch was not water resistant and only by the sweat of my hand, I like this watch, but did not work properly"
4,Amazing watch at amazing price,"First off let me say that the pictures do not do this watch justice! I was very surprised when I opened the box and saw just how much better it really looked! I have always been a citizen watch fan but wanted something different and figured at this price it was worth a shot, and I couldnt be happier I made this choice! If your looking for a great time piece that not only looks great but is tough and functional this is for you. Let me warn you though it is alittle on the heavy side so if you prefer something you cant tell your wearing you may want to look elsewhere. That aside I cant find ANY cons with this purchase. I ordered it on 6/16/10 and by 6/22/10 it was on my wrist. I would recommend this watch to anyone that like me enjoys wearing a beautiful timepiece that is stunning to look at and can take some abuse."
4,decent,good thing to wear when i don't want to wear my seamaster looks like a million bucks and shipping was great the band is a pos and use spilt pin just a warning. but over all a good value and has kept decent time.
5,Awesome watch,"It may be a little too soon to rate it but I love the watch. It has a good weight to it, looks like a 5K dollar watch and its not lost the time in the last 24 hours. Maybe it loses a few seconds a month but I can live with that for the price. The second hand sweeps, doesn't tick. Very happy with the purchase. I'll probably buy another."
3,The blue is gaudy,"The only problem I have with Invicta watches is: they seem to run alright - but the customer feedback is terrible on the company. Nothing but complaints about customer service. I've bought 3 (Two automatics and a quartz) and haven't had any trouble, so I can't corroborate the bitching.The watch is very nicely made, well finished and all that, it even feels very comfortable to wear. The problem I had with this one is the color: It is much brighter in the flesh than on the page. It fairly leaps off your wrist into people's eyes. Good from a bling standpoint, not good if you're trying to be conservative. I thought it would be closer to an Omega Seamaster blue.Otherwise it's a nice watch"
5,Fantastic,"I have owned this watch for about two months now. It was damaged while at Army Basic training and all it took was a 2 minute call to Invicta to get everything sorted out. I have heard many stories about Invicta having awful customer service, which almost dissuaded me from buying one in the first place. This may have held true in the past, but they have EXCELLENT customer service now a days. The watch holds time true, maybe losing a few seconds a day. I cannot count the number of times that it has been mistaken for a Rolex or TAG. Would definitely buy from Invicta again."
3,Misleading color,Is a great watch but I returned it because it wasn't the color I expected it to be. When you look at the picture you would think is blue but is actually purple.
2,It's purple..,"Reading other reviews that the 9094 is blue to purple depending on lighting, I ordered this with a 8926c (black face, coin edge) as backup. Right out of the box it looked purple. I proceeded to look at it under xenon, halogen and incandescent lighting. Still purple. Who knows, maybe at work under fluorescent it's blue. But for me the 8926c is going to have to be it."
3,great watch...if you dont use it to dive,"So I love this watch...but it is deffinetly not an actual dive watch. Don't dive with this thing. I went swimming in the ocean with it, and when I was washing it afterwords the numbers on the bezel fell off. I shouldnt be too surprised known invictas sketchy quality control, and should be giving this a worse review, but I do really love this watch. It keeps really good time, it only loses 4 seconds a day. Also it looks great. It really looks like a more expensive watch which is nice. So if you willing to take a chance that your watch will break, this is a nice watch. Btw, don't expect anything from there customer service it is rubish."
2,"good looking but it would wind down during the night, had to reset every morning.","nice looking, but would wind down during the night every night. had to reset every morning. i returned it. wish i could have kept it."
3,Ease of rotating the timing bezel is VERY hard !,"I just received this watch as a retirement gift which was purchased from Amazon.I love the looks of it, and the automatic/self wind (no battery) feature... but what I like most in my watches is a rotating bezel for timing various things... I'm not a scuba diver, but I do time many things, especially when cooking, walking, or anything that needs to be timed within an hour or less.The ""rotating"" bezel on this watch is NOT very easy to rotate... there is nothing on it to help grasp it... my ""Timex Men's T49776 Casual Diver Watch"" that I bought from Amazon has a much better timing bezel that is easy to grasp and rotate... this Invicta watch does NOT !Do any of the ""engineers"" that design these watches ever use them ? Sure does not seem like it.Any one else have issues rotating this timing bezel ?"
1,waches,"i don`t like it, because i was waitting Japanese automatic watch.But i reseved chiness wach.It is the client's deception"
1,Disappointing Timepiece,"I was very pleased with the watch until it started showing moisture inside the dial following swimming at the beach one day. It still keeps accurate time, but is obviously not as waterproof as claimed."
2,What you see is NOT what you get,"I own at least 30 Invictas and love most of them. However, their current rage for their most attractive styles is to make BIG watches, 46-50 mil and above. I wanted something in the 42-43 mil range which is how this is advertised. I also liked the fact that the movement was apparently the Myiota movement I have in several of my Invicta automatics. Excellent durable movement. THIS WATCH IS NOT 43 MIL IT IS 40 (I already own one in 40 mil with a nicer dial) AND IT DOES NOT HAVE A MYIOTA MOVEMENT. Sent it back disappointed. By the way, I do own a 43 mil Invicta in brown with a Myiota movement so I know they make or at least made them. I'm growing wary of the new Invictas -- not just size wise -- they are looking somewhat cheaper in quality to me these days."
3,cannot set the time accurate to the second,"Got the watch and it looked great. I followed the instructions on the user manual to set the time. The watch was supposed to stop when I pulled out the crown to position 1. But the Second Hand keeps moving. Actually, there was no way for me to stop the Second Hand. If the Second Hand cannot be stopped, there is no way to set the time accurate to the second. There will be always 30 seconds difference between my watch and my Atomic Clock. Am I over critical or missing something here?"
5,Invicta 9094,"This is an excellent watch for the money - heavy, durable and accurate. Looks very classy and the bracelet is snug and comfortable on my wrist. The only downside I can see (as others have mentioned) is that the night-time visibility doesn't last long - about 30 minutes in the dark - but I can live with that for the money.All in all - well worth the money, and I shall be buying more Invicta products in the future and recommending them to my friends and family for sure."
3,"Pretty watch, hard to regulate","I recently bought this watch and noticed it was losing almost one minute per day. So I have been trying to regulate it and find that it is much harder than most automatics. Even with very very minute adjustments it goes from minus 45 (-45/day) to about plus 60 (+60/day). This, using a jewelers loupe and tweezers. I have never had this much trouble regulating a watch. Any advice other than going for quartz?"
5,"Great buy, great price","The Invicta automatic Pro Diver is a great buy. The japanese auto is as good as any swiss made eta caliber. It runs exactly on time,less than a second per month(!).Invicta's case and bracelet present a very high swiss quality finishing.Amazon's price was far below of what is expected compared to the portuguese market."
5,Perfect,"This is Japanese Precision at its best! This watch is by far the best bang for its buck that I have seen! Very comfortable to wear as well, and functional."
4,"Great look, seem to work fine","Solid built and great look. I have carried my old Invicta a little over 2 years befor a part broke - the repair job costs $20 which is reasonable, it's no Rolex but for the price good value I'd say."
5,Reliable and Stunning Timepiece,"I have had the Invicta Pro Diver for a little bit more than a year and I am enjoying every minute of it. It is a good looking watch that can be easily confused with a Rolex Sub, even the 'sweep' of the second hand does not differ from the Rolex one. The time keeping is very good, it probably looses one minute per week compared to my iphone time. The bracelet is strong and the whole enclosure gives you the confidence of well assembled piece. It looks good in every occassion however I use it mostly for work and the regular hang-out time."
3,time flies by,"If you buy this watch, every two weeks you'll notice that your the first to arrive at your job and then realise you have to set the time of your watch again.. Seriously I gain 3 or 4 minutes every two weeks. It does'nt take to long to change it so I don't mind..Otherwise the watch looks very good, it looks like an expensive watch and that's the reason I bought it, but I would not recommand it to an accountant or anyone who's a little bit anal (by Freud standard of course).."
5,beautiful watch - what a value!,"My husband has wanted this watch for a long time. With such a huge discount off the retail price by ordering thru Amazon, I could not resist purchasing it for our 1st wedding anniversary. It looks and feels expensive, has a nice weight, and he was thrilled to receive it"
4,Male Hormones!,This wasn't a bad book helping with sex education. It wasn't imbarrising it was straight forward and my son liked that.
5,"An excellent, very thorough book for guiding young boys through the teen years","This book's been an excellent ice-breaker for getting the lines of communication open with my son, who's at ""that age""- when it's time to start having talks about things that can be uncomfortable. I really like how thorough this book is, it really covers a lot of ground and offers a lot of information about things that I feel are important for my son to know. I highly recommend this for anyone with a pre-teen/teenage boy."
5,Uses Great 50's Car Photos -- A Great Book for Dads to Use,"This is ""THE BOOK"" for Dads to review with their sons. The author successfully uses ""car talk"" to explain becoming a man. Clever chapter titles include: ""Under the Hood: Parts,"" ""The Ignition System: How It All works,"" ""Road Hazards: STD,"" ""Maintenance,"" etc. I got a kick out of discussing the old retro-car photos with my sons. The funny retro-pictures kept the topic from getting uncomfortable and gave us guys something else to talk about other than sex ... when things got a little too uncomfortable. My sons reread to certain often. Definitely buy ............................................. This book is guy-focused, uses guy-slang, and has guy-humor."
1,Group Masturbation? Read it BEFORE you give it to your kid!,A lot of good things in this book and it had many good reviews- but I browsed through it before I gave it to my son.I notice most people do not read what they give there children to read.First - I think the minimum age for this book would be 14.Any younger will just go over there head and be to confusing - to much information.Second - there is a part about group masturbation that I found really odd.True all guys masturbate- but in groups with friends?That basically was a deal breaker and I found another book called'Boy's Guide to Becoming a Teen'.It hits all the points on sex plus drugs and dealing with emotional issues.I think it is great and for ages as low as 10 thru high school.My son really appreciated it and felt much less confused about everything.
5,I didn't believe it either!,"This book will totally surprise you. I know something about cooking, so I was convinced that removing some of the butter, oil, eggs, etc., would render many of these sweet recipies inedible. But then I bought this and tried some of these ""healthy homestyle desserts"" after I bought Tribole's other book, STEALTH HEALTH. All I can tell you is the woman is a magician. And she made me feel like one, too! If you don't believe me, just take her Chocolate Turtle Pecan Cookies to your next church bake sale and watch the reaction."
4,Pleasure in sweets without excess guilt!,"I believe Carbohydrates are the bigges dieting problem but we all need to satisfy our sweet teeth! Here are some wonderful recipes which are fun to do, try and enjoy without guilt, guilt and too many calories. Enjoy your treats, you deserve them!"
1,order cancelled,"I ordered combo: kayak, reserve seat and rudder. They shipped seats and rudder in a week and kayak never arrived. 1 month later the order is cancelled by seller.Now I have 2 reserve seats and 1 rudder, and no kayak.I ordered this from amazon, using my amazon account. All plans we had for vacation are gone. So, make your own conclusion about this story. But know it before you decide to buy the combo. They should not advertise if they can nit deliver. This caused a lot of distress.I wish I could review kayak itself, but..."
2,only buy it for the Lina song,"the rest of the songs here are old boring rock tunes that could be labelled as ""Ballads So Dull They Could Be Played At Carpet Shops"". Lina's ""Right Place Wrong Time"" is a good chunk of commercial R&B mixed with big band jazz samples and is the only reason to buy this soundtrack."
2,Looks great for a pictorial. but a disppointing read.,"it is just a book on how lighting setup of various pictures are done......and that is all!nothing was mentioned about how photographing people should be done, how different lighting equipments can cause what type of effects, what sorts of lighting is suitable for types of mood, how models or people should posed or photographed.........i gave it a two stars for the pictures."
3,"..a combo of previous ""how to"" cook books..!!","This is actually a combo of previous ""how to"" cook books with all essence on it. If you don't have his previous works or want to have ""One"" only, this is your choice..!! The weight of this book is kind of heavy, but very useful and interesting..!!"
5,A great book,"For any beginner, amateur or even a professional interested in portraits and/or glamour, this book can prove to be an extremly helpful learning tool. The book shows you the pictures taken along with lighting setups and explanations from the photographer himself. The book does not teach you the technical aspects of lighting such as the colour balance and light temp, but instead talks about how each photographer used thier creativity and innovation to capture images in situations. It is a great book to experiment from and through which you will learn tremendously. a must have."
5,Excellent use of diagrams and notes enhances understanding of Images,"Though this book is not for someone completely unfamiliar with photography, it is great for those with basic studio lighting skills. If you've ever wondered, ""how did the photographer get that shot?"" the diagrams in this book provide you with a perspective beyond the finished print.I enjoyed this book primarily because of its unique setup. Instead of a discussion of lighting techniques and how to use studio equipment, the book provides a visual glossary of terms, and then shows you many images. Each full-page image is accompanied by another full page containing the photographers' notes, studio diagrams, and camera settings.From basic lighting setups to elaborate, this one should get you thinking about your own creative lighting techniques.(As a warning, this book does have a small section with nude figures)"
2,Why is this book a combination of old books?,This book is a combination of old books with old ideas. The description should say that all the publishers have done is combine old work! What a dissapointment.
5,Why has Columbia nixed this masterpiece?,"This album is wonderful! Almost every track is glorious. And it's such a shame that this is no longer in print. The sound is wonderful.But for some reason, Columbia (and other labels) have decided to re-release and re-package old jazz recordings like this one from the 20's and 30's, with ""remastering"" that, for me, totally ruins the sound.I know that they're trying to make the recordings sound better, but they only end up ruining the recordings as far as my ears can tell. And it's really a shame.I wish they would keep the original pre-""remastered"" CD's, like this one, on the market."
3,"Ok, if you don't look close","This wine barrel plaque is cheap in all ways. It is affordable, but made in china quality down to the glued on cork and the brass finishing nails. The finish is poorly done and needs a good coat of tongue oil to bring out the beauty of the wood better. A dab of black wrought iron craft paint on the nail heads will help make it more authentic looking as well. All in all it would not go on my wall looking as is until I fixed it and made it look like a higher quality product. For the price it was worth it to finish it myself. But I am a artist and handy person. For those looking for higher quality... this is not for you and you maybe a little disappointed. For those who just want something cheap and somewhat decent looking... this maybe to your liking"
3,First Stick Damaged,This would be a 5 star review but the first stick of memory I got was damaged. I could not tell if this was due to manufacture issue or a shipping/warehouse storage issue. The first stick was warped almost like it had gotten to hot. Amazon was great about the return and the replacement worked like a dream with zero issues running Memtest86+ to test it.
1,rip off!,"This has to be the worst purchase I've ever made for my son. The web-blaster wouldn't work in the harness. My son decided to just to run around with the can of silly string without the glove and harness. But, the can itself had problems and the string would just spatter out most of the time. By the way, the can was empty after 3 minutes! Also, the water blaster didn't work. We pumped it, and only filled it half full like the instructions said to do, but all it did was leak. It is a shame that something like this can be put on the shelf. You'd be a fool to buy one."
3,Irritating for parents,I asked my guests specifically not to buy this item for my 4 year old son's birthday. One person did anyway and it is as much of a problem as I had expected. He can't operate it (well) on his own or change the items. He's lost all but 2 of the darts and I haven't been able to find any replacements yet. He does still love the toy but it's an awful lot of work for parents.
2,quickly not fun,"My son loved it when he saw it. He was later dissapointed. He wanted to shoot all day and let me tell you, you dont want blue all over your house, plus is sticky. Runs out quick. Refills are expensive."
2,Not much fun,"I agree with the previous reviewers. My nephews each received a set, and while they did have some fun with it, it was very difficult to use. The can of silly string didn't work in the holster, so they just sprayed it straight from the can. They had fun, but it was gone in a few minutes and there was a big mess to clean up. The water blaster didn't spray much water and they needed an adult to help pump it. I think their favorite part of the set is the glove - they like to wear it and pretend to be Spiderman. If you know a child who is crazy about Spiderman, I think there are better choices out there."
1,"Mess, Junk","This toy is junk. It doesn't work properly, the water shooter leaks all over, and the silly string web blaster just sputters blue crap all over my yard. I can't pick it up, rack it up or mow it up. We have had two very large rain storms since he emptied the can (in 5 min) and it is still there. If your smart don't buy it."
4,A mior problem corrected,"Ordered three games, but they were inadvertently sent without the balls. Wood Expressions were notified immediately in a humorous way (telling them they had sent us the female version). They responded immediately with both an e-mail message and a shipment; within several days, three sets of balls were in our possession.Good company. Would do business with them again."
4,Django Rheinhardt reincarnated,"Marc Ribot ain't everybody's cup o tea. I discovered him on Tom Waites' Big Time, and read the small print to see who the hell that incredible guitar player was. Then I got Muy Divertado, Saints, and a couple other Ribot albums. One at a time. The damn things are addicting. He gets more soul out of a guitar than you'd think possible. Especially in Saints, which is nothing BUT guitar, with some nasal breathing thrown in inadvertently. If you're a Django fan, you'll love Ribot. If you're not, why not? What's wrong with you? Just kidding. But Ribot is the same sort of acquired taste as Django."
1,Just didn't work for me,"Don't get me wrong, I love Ribot; his stuff with Medeski Martin and Wood was great. Based on what I had heard there, I went with this album. All I heard was guitar. Plucking of a guitar. It's one thing to have solo guitar, as in some strumming here and there, but this sounded as if it had no musical scheme whatsoever. Maybe this is just too experimental for me, I don't know."
1,avant twaddle,"This cd is a dull exercise in lame NY avant guitar twaddle. Luckily it only cost me 2.98. Spare yourself the financial losses, and avoid this junk at all ""costs."""
1,Tripe trying to be Avant Garde,"Having taken up guitar when I was 13 and investing 40 years of experience and experimentation I was overwhelmed by the deja vu of this cd. It took me back to my third month of practicing and made me relive a memory that I had long since forgotten. This is first time I have heard something that has motivated me to write a review. If I could sue to get me money back I would and I imagine I could get a class action suit going too. This is nothing more than tripe trying to be avant garde. I like all forms of music done well, but trying to breeze this by as music worth burning on a cd is rediculous. I've listened and own music from say John Zorn, etc. so I'm fully aware and prepared for the approach. Please re-think and save your money. This is [not good]. Since there was not a position for placing no stars I was forced to put one star, it really should be taking from the shelves and used for flipping burgers."
4,Trying old classics that Carlos Marin did,I purchased this because I was trying to find past work that Carlos Marin of IL Divo did. Thought this was nice to find past performances of singer I like.
4,Actually its rather good!,"There's been a lot of negative comments about this book but I genuinely believe its among his best. Jack Vance doesn't write like any other Fantasy/Science-fiction author today. He's the last of a dying breed. I recently read the Gray Mouser stories and I was struck by how similar in tone these stories were to the stories of Jack Vance. Complex, richly detailed but they paled in comparison. The thing that has always made Jack Vance stand out from the crowd is the beauty of his language and his situations. This book is the epitomy of a Jack Vance novel-dark, macabre, funny and haunting. Not many people still read his books which is a shame because he is the orginal of so many things. I recommend 'Ports of Call' wholeheartedly."
4,"drifting, entertaining, but not exciting","Being a vivid fan of the master, I eagerly awaited his latest output. I'm not disappointed, because it is a neat story with beautiful descriptions and it kind of floats. But it is his first story ever without a climax and I wonder whether this might be his last book and in a way his good-bye."
1,"overwritten, overrated and not over soon enough","No characters, no plot - a complete waste of time. Avoid"
4,Classic Vance,"Ports of Call has all the classic Vancean ingredients, interesting travel to a variety of wierd and less than wonderful dystopic worlds where the locals are to say the least idiosyncratic, slippery and all shades on the way to vile. Vance is the master of local colour and characterisation. I particlarly like how he takes out his typical descriptive weapons - detailed descriptions of outre clothing, climate, geography, buildings, the inevitable ""Local Bar"", local customs and especially the food served at the ""local bar"" or the hotel that the characters inevitabley book into. Very reminicent of Cudgels Saga and Planet of Adventure. I notice eel is always on the menu somewhere in a vance book. Also inevitably some local huckster it trying to take the hero down.Its as if Jack has rifled through his entire output and picked up bits and peices, sown them into a verbal quilt and called it ""Ports of Call"". Thats OK - you get good solid Vance in this book."
3,Not Jack Vance's best,"I agree with those who say that this is not Jack Vance's best work. But my main concern here is the Booklist Review. Did they even read the book? The review is factually incorrect. Myron was the captain of his aunt's ship before she fired him, but not the captain of the Glicca."
4,Cool Adventure amonsg the Stars,"In this book, Jack Vance gives us a delightful and apparently gentle look at the Gaian Reach. Myron Tany gets the chance to journey amongst the stars instead of becoming an accountant. Unfortunately he was travelling with his eccentric great aunt who took against his staid choices, leaving him to make his own way home"
4,"Not Vance's best work, but...","Vance does with the book what he does best. He creates vivid imagery, great and quirky characters, charming situations, and new and unusual cultural perspectives. On the negative side, the book lacks a cohesive story and has very little plot. Is is almost just a series of vignettes. It is very likely meant to be the first book in a series as it has no real conclusion.For all of that, a true Jack Vance fan will enjoy it, because it gives healthy dose of the Vance experience. The fragments the story divides itself into are interesting enough and done with sufficient mastery to make the book well worth reading. For those drab souless people with no grandness of vision who do not like Jack Vance, there probably will be little appeal to the book."
4,Uneasy feeling,"Somehow I had an uneasy feeling about this book. Most of the Master's book I tend to reread at least once a year. This one, I even forgot that I bought it until I rearranged my bookshelf. The language is (how could it be else) elegant, the persons in a way familiar. Somewhere however I miss the strength of the plot as so clearly present in earlier books. But even still, I wouldn't want to miss the book and sincerly hope that this not to be the last book by Mr. Vance, written as a kind of revenge for some bad critics he received as a writer and leave us with a cliff hanger......"
2,A disappointment,"For an author who wrote such a large amount of splendid books, this is rather poor. No magic or even a plot, but too many clichés in the many anecdotes about strange places and strange peoples. Even the 'hero' is rather colourless. It has its moments, but for the rest it is written without much inspiration. A pity."
2,The description is misleading,"I was shocked when I got the bag to find out that it was made of white fabric with butterfly prints (which would stain in no time), there was a little leather edging, when in the description it mentions leather first then fabric which made me think the fabric was lining, which is coherent with the last part of the description-- The bag is overly priced for its real value, I was totally disappointed with the bag -- I wish I could return it but I'm outside the US now, and it would cost me much more to return"
2,"Stale, and uninformed by real interaction with policymaking","Why bother writing a book that is just an outside observer's take on the issues. If this book showed any real authority it would be worthwhile, but it completely lacks any sign that the author is actually making policy, rather he is simply observing and harping on what the real policymakers are doing. He should have made it more clear that he had no real influence or involvement in policy. I felt the book was misleading."
5,Great Book,"I've been a practioner in the Bujinkan since 1992. If you study this art then you will understand the movements that you see shown. You'll be able to make the leap and know what is actually going in the pictures. As far as philosphy goes, its the Boss's art. The Boss has been dealing with the negative Hollywood Image for years and this book explains his opinion and his knowledge on the subject of Ninjutsu. No one knows this subject better than him. If you want to believe Hollywood, Turnbell, and all the rest, then go ahead. Or believe what the Boss is talking about. Its really your choice."
2,"Here's the Track List, But What a Disappointment","I note that this CD is rare per [...] No wonder; the sound just isn't up to Beach Boy standards except perhaps ""Rock and Roll Music"".There are only a couple tracks that made the Billboard 100 Top Singles charts as noted below. Peak position and year are indicated where applicable.1. Rock and Roll Music - #5 (1976)2. It's OK - #29 (1976)3. Had to Phone Ya4. Chapel of Love (a cover)5. Everyone's in Love with You6. Talk to Me (a cover)7. That Same Song8. T M Song9. Palisades Park (a cover)10. Susie Cincinnati11. A Casual Look12. Blueberry Hill (a cover)13. Back Home14. In the Still of the Night (a cover)15. Just Once in My Life"
2,The Idea Was Great,"I'm going to have to say that I expected so much more from this film from all the clips of it I had seen before renting it. I was let down by it. I feel like it may have been poor directing or even a poor screenplay, but it was all too simple. It wasn't real enough for me. Annabelle kept appearing in every scene and she lacked character depth, as did the teacher. I just feel like there wasn't enough build up of tension and drama, neither character really got to know the other and when it seemed as if they were trying to, everything was cliche and unrealistic.So I'm going to have to say that this could have been an amazing film, but instead it's was only a good idea that was executed poorly. And that's unfortunate."
2,Move on if you are heterosexual...,"One reviewer says this is not a sex movie. The next reviewer says the sex scene between the two women is 'smokin' hot'! I guess sex and 'smokin' hot' is in the eye of the beholder, then. Thanks, ladies, for telling me this is a movie for lesbians. That's important information and should be stamped across the title in big letters to alert those might have thought it's a romantic story, the kind heterosexuals might enjoy."
4,Great tearjerker romance movie for lesbians,"This movie made me cry. I like their use of quotes to express certian things in the movie. This movie is not just some sappy romance; in fact there are only a couple make out scenes. This is an intelligent romance between two women. The fact that Annabelle is only 17 does not even seem to be a big deal. Simone is 32 and is young herself. The women look very beautiful together, Annabelle with her dark hair and Simone with her blonde hair. I wish that the alternate ending was the real ending. When you watch this movie; go the alternate ending afterwords. I am waiting for a sequel. There are no current lesbian movies that even compete with this! This is even better than when night is falling or better than chocolate."
4,A New Way of Life,"Nothing much is written for us males about the hows and whys of women and their loves. Even after nearly a half century of married life, I can honestly say that there is much I don't understand. As a small, but valuable peek into one woman's psyche, this movie served an admirable purpose. It was recommended by a friend as a first step; that purpose it did splendidly. I would recommend this movie to any guy out there who wants to have his eyes opened a little bit, to glimpse a strange and wonderful world."
3,Nice film,"Loving Annabelle is an enjoyable watch. There is very little character development and the film is only 77 minutes long but it's worth seeing if you like this genre. It is a slice of life narrative more than anything, a glimpse in to someone elses world. I liked it. The extras on the dvd made it feel more complete as well."
3,viewed,I veiwed this did not purchase. No fault of the website or seller. I hope I don't have to answer for everything I have looked at and not purchased.... little tiring.
4,Enjoyable,"This was a plausible and enjoyable movie, although we four viewers preferred the alternative ending provided over the actual movie ending."
2,Maybe we've set the bar too low...,"...because I'm shocked at the number of 4 and 5 star reviews. Just because there are so few lesbian films does not mean that you have to train yourself to enjoy movies that are poorly written or acted.I got about 95% of the way through this movie before I stopped. I realized that I didn't care if the women in the movie lived or died.The young girl in the movie is supposed to be a ""bad"" girl (conveyed to us by her smoking and her awful orange highlights). The character of the teacher is hardly developed. And while I'm not shallow, I couldn't concentrate on anything she was saying due to the Grand Canyon-like wrinkle between her eyebrows.It's not sexy. It's poorly filmed. It's predictable.If you enjoy things like American Idol, cargo shorts, and Katy Perry, then go for it. If you have taste, then don't waste your time."
3,It's kind of jumpy...,"This movie is ok. It could have been a improved upon on so many levels. The way that the movie was edited is really weird; it jumps around everywhere. It was a nice plot and story to work with, I don't know why the ending is the way it is.'Loving Annabelle' is just one of those movies that if you could do over again with some ""tweaks"", it would be a 5 star movie.If you're bored and have seen everything else, then it's worth renting."
5,"Loved ""Loving""","I loved this film. I really liked how Annabelle was gradual and kept her cool. This tension between Simone and her fiance added to the heat. This was not a film about lesbian sex, which (yes, even as a young horny guy) I really liked. The film focused on the forbidden aspects: Catholic school mixed with homosexuality and a teacher/student relationship equaled a great cocktail. Gotta see this film! I have half a dozen times now...and not just ""the scene""!"
5,loving annabelle,"Very well filmed and edited indi film!! I watched this as a filmaker several times. Especially grand to see a film done with good taste,accurately portrays real relationships dealing with tender and sensitive subject matter. Well done! Kudos to the writer/director and actors."
1,Not the best I've seen,"This isn't the most stimulating video of this type I've seen. I was hoping for more, uh, action than this movie contains."
2,Not loving this film,"Incredibly contrived and sadly lacking in chemistry, this film is a thin refashioning of ""Girl, Interrupted."" The premise is a winner under any circumstance--misunderstood youth falls in love with authority figure, who after wrestling with her feelings and against all odds returns the sentiment. The story is unbelievable, namely that the underacted and precocious Annabelle doesn't even demonstrate half of the feeling or depth we are supposed to also have for this tumultuous romance."
2,"eh, just when it gets good/","The movie is good, it keeps you interested. But just when it gets really good it ends. You don't even realize its going off. You are left waiting for the next scene and the movie stops. I wouldn't recommend buying it."
4,First time...,"I watched it, I felt like I was Annabelle. I had a crush on a teacher but it wasn't anything like this. But I loved the movie nonetheless"
3,Loving Annabell DVD,Beautifully produced film of the classic student-seduces-teacher-with-disasterous-results theme.Casting and acting just OK. Film sets are very good. I felt I was back in prep school. :-)
4,guilty pleasure....A+,"what more i could say....i stumble into the title in this site...and i took a gamble...most of us know the story, hoping and praying that is good as the reviews....but then, magic! starts slowly, yes is one those things...but for character development!!! studying both annabelle and Simone...and their respective paths...and how both find love in the most onorthodox and inexplicable way...it's not the grossing lesbian explotation film...so guys a token of advise, it's a lesbian movie made by a lesbian for lesbians!!! if you want soft-porn go to that section...if you want candlelights and a romantic movie that takes you to the soul of the heart, then this is your movie!!!!"
5,Loving Annabelle,That was definitely the BEST lesbian film I have EVER seen. I have watched it over and over again. It is an amazing film. A MUST SEE!!!!!!! Great job to Katherine Brooks. Hope to see more of her work.
4,Yummy Fun!,"""Loving Annabelle"" was, surprisingly, a very touching film. I got it for the 7 day On Demand thing from Amazon without really checking out the reviews, so was a little upset by the teacher/student idea at first. Normally I would just be disgusted by the idea. Not sure why that wasn't the case with this one except that the student is the pursuer and the teacher seems so vulnerable. Anyway, the tension is delicious and the sex-scene is HOT! And I'm buying it. It was a little choppy... seemed to miss some opportunities to explain a few things, but still tons better than most lesbian fare out there!"
5,Loving Annabelle,"I took a stab when I purchased this movie, thinking its just another typical love story about two Women. Was I ever wrong! The chemistry between Erin Kelly and Diane Gaidry was so believable I almost forgot I was watching a movie. The acting and music was great. Kudos to Catherine Brooks for making this such a great love story. I like the way she didn't over do the scences and they seemed to fall into each other without boring the audience. One of my favorites of all times."
1,Not impressed with a movie about breaching ethics,"So when is it okay for a high school teacher to get involved with his or her student? It's a shame that the lesbian situation had to be sensationalized by the unethical choice a teacher made to get involved with her student. So not cool. Lesbians are not unintelligent uninformed weak and spineless individuals who fall for children. They are strong, ethical and kind, and go out of their way to protect children. Did you see the Mother Superior try to hit on Simone? Wow, and a Catholic high school allowed this to be filmed on their campus. Not cool.I believe that people should be allowed to love whom they please. However, in both heterosexual and homosexual living, please don't make a romantic drama about pedophelia. I was not impressed."
4,Forgetting Reality,I would have to say it was a good buy. You get so much into the story of their lives that you forget that it is a student and a teacher. I recommend adding it to your DVD collection.
1,There is no story here. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,"Pretentious and boring. I felt embarrassed for the filmmakers. It appears that little or no effort was employed in the making of this vapid waste of celluloid. It's not bold. It is garbage thrown at the feet of desperate lesbians. ""Oh. We'll watch anything and applaud as long as you don't ignore us."""
2,Bad acting and poor plot,I rented this movie because of the 5 star rating. The acting is sub-par and the plot non-exsistent. The reason I rated *Loving Annabelle* the 2-star rating is due to some pretty decent music.
4,Loving Annabelle,"Considering the genre of the film, as well as the subject matter, I found it to be fresh and tasteful. Working with a limited budget must have been so difficult, but the combined talents of director and actors provided quite a chemistry. The ending was hard but true to life. Once we make our own bed we must lie in it, so to speak."
3,Good Ideas,A good book with ideas to start your morning meetings in primary grades. I used several ideas from the book and inter-twined them with my already used schedule.
3,New and unique veil moves very little detail on expressiveness,"I enjoyed the beautiful new veil moves and I will definetly be using some of these unique moves in my dance. The moves were very well explained with good quality video and sound. I was hoping for an explanation of how to use my veil to emote a variety of moods to my audience. I am trying to be more expressive in my dance and I am always on the look-out for videos that will cue me in on how to pose, move and use props to display emotions. 'Expressive Bellydance' had a few sentances on this topic but no direct demonstrations on how to use the veil to express emotions.If you are interested in learning several new veil moves and watching a beautiful performance by Kaeshi then this video is a good investment. I would purchase it again just to watch Kaeshi perform!"
3,"Please Kate, quit making mediocre movies!","I absolutely love Kate Hudson and her acting. She is definitely not choosing the right movies when she has to lower herself to be in a movie with Owen Wilson and the pretty boy from Entourage. Kate is better than this movie, I hope she was just transitioning after her personal troubles and goes back to making quality movies that challenge her terrific acting abilities. The Skeleton Key, even How to loose a guy in 10 days were much better than this piece of garbage. Hopefully I can resell it for 1/8th of the purchase price to get my money back. It is not recommended by this movie buff."
5,Yet Another Romantic Comedy,"Well... this is the same old same old romantic comedy. So, you know the drill. You laugh, you cry, you laugh again, and then everybody has a happy ending. That's about it. The casts are good. Things look real. So, it is not a bad movie. So, go see it."
1,Should be zero,"This movie is very disapointing! there are some funny gags in the first ten minutes and then it completely loses the plot (a very weak one at that). It drags, it's not funny towards the end and oh my god is it cheesy and not in the good way. If you are tired and expect to fall asleep 10-15minutes into the movie, then watch it otherwise, don't waste your time."
3,wife liked it,"familiar story (cf Down and Out in Beverly Hills), some shouting and falling over, masturbation jokes - you know the drill. Tiresome after a while, but the wife sorta liked it after a hard day with the kids.....Owen Wilson - you were good in Behind Enemy Lines, so less of this boring shaggy guy thing would be nice...."
3,Was Hoping,"With such a talented and likeable cast, I was hoping for more from this movie. Aside from the 3 stars, you also have Michael Douglas making a signifigant contribution to the film. He plays Hudson's father well, but the part is not written well. Hudson and Dillon mostly play things straight, which would be great if Wilson was being completely zainy. But Wilson is not really over the top as a boy trapped in a man's body, so the film sort of sputters along without any really big laughs. It tries to be sweet and amusing, but it fails more times than not. I would rent this one before considering a buy."
2,just ok,"this film started out with some interesting things here&there. but after the middle part to the ending this film just falls flat on cliches. Owen Wilson and kate Hudson had more chemistry. Matt Dillion is alright,but He doesn't really fit his role. Michael Douglas seems ok,but His Role doesn't even really make a whole lot of sense. this film should have been Better,but it never quites get going fully."
2,tedious,"I generally like Owen Wilson and find him to be quite funny. In this movie, he plays his usual airhead character. But it wasn't that funny. To be sure, he was the bright spot of the movie, but it was not enough to carry the whole show. I often sat there watching this thing, wondering when something of substance, or even better yet something funny, would happen. This movie felt long, very long, fast-forward long. At least HD DVD picture quality was very good. But I'm glad I just rented it and I still wish I had my 2 hours back."
1,Horrible,"This movie was just plain awful. The jokes weren't even funny at all. Everything was bad on this movie. I knew I should've saw Pirates of the Caribbean 2, darn!!!"
4,I Liked it,I thought this movie was good. It was funny and I LOVED the story line. My favorite character was Murphy (lol).
1,"OH NO, ANOTHER HOUR OF THIS?","TO ANYONE CONTEMPLATING BUYING OR RENTING THIS MOVIE, I'LL JUST TELL YOU THIS. I WAS WATCHING THIS MOVIE AS I WALKED IN MY THREADMILL LAST NIGHT. I COULN'T UNDERSTAND BUT I HAD TO CHANGE MOVIE FROM DVD PLAYING TO MY CABLE PROGRAMS. WHY? YOU ASK, BECAUSE THIS MOVIE WAS PAINFUL TO WATCH. BUT I KEPT WATCHING A LITTLE BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT THIS MOVIE COULN'T BE MORE THAN 80-90 MINUTES LONG. BUT AS THIS S___ KEPT DRAGING ON AND ON, I CHECKED HOW LONG THIS MOVIE WAS. WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT THE MOVIE WAS ALMOST 2 HOURS, I TOOK THE DVD OUT AND CURSED THE PEOPLE WHO CAME UP WITH THIS GARBAGE. I ONLY RENTED THIS BAD MOVIE AND I AM SORRY I SPEND MONEY ON THIS!"
2,not funny,"I don't know why I am writing this under the kids review because I am not a kid.. that's besides the point. I am going to make this VERY simple. I have seen funnier Disney movies. If you are looking for non stop laughs, look else where. Not funny. Maybe a couple of parts and they were not even laugh out loud funny. You have been warned."
3,it was allright,"It was all right. It had a few funny moments, but it wasn't that great. Owen WIlson looked extremely sweaty in the first half of the movie."
2,An O.K. movie,I bought this movie after seeing that Owen Wilson was in it.( I have been obsessed with him ever since Wedding Crashers: awesome movie.) The acting was good and everything but it just wasn't funny. It was not what I thought it would be at all! I don't see the romantic comedy part at all...So I give it two stars because it only gave me a chuckle or two at the most.
1,Who in their right minds....?,"Who in his or her right minds would allow behavior like their guest Owen Wilson's and permit him to remain with them for even a night? Has our concept of friendship dipped so low that we feel obligated to allow a ""friend"" to treat us so abysmally? OK, for purposes of the movie we suspend our everyday notions of ethics and morals so that we can have a comedy. Unfortunately, it is not believable in any respect, even as comedy. It is not funny, and I like funny! Even worse, it is not clever. It wastes Kate Hudson and Matt Dillon's abilities and demands much more than Owen Wlson is able to deliver! Deserves a zero rating or even less. Can we do that on our Amazon.com ratings? I haven't tried to see if Amazon's software will accept a no-star rating. I must try that when I encounter another turkey like this one."
4,"No wedding crashers, but a funny movie, good cast, and enough laughs. Not such a bomb as others reviewers have said.","I actually bought this movie on sale at Nebraska Furnature mart on impulse. I had no expectations for this movie to be like Wedding crashers, a big comedy hit for Owen wilson Last year. And I think they did ok with this movie. Karl and Molly are newlyweds when Karl's best friend Dupree finds himself on the skids. Karl opens his door to Dupree, 20+ years of friendship is hard to break...or is it? We forgot about Molly. And the Kicker in this all is Molly's dad, Played by Michael Douglas, who incidently is Karls boss. Follow the Triad of Karl, Molly and Dupree, and have some laughs along the way as well. Again, it's no wedding crashers, but it has funny moments. If your skeptical, rent it first, but not bad for the collection either."
3,"5-star cast, 2-star script","Newly-married Carl (Matt Dillon) is torn between his responsibilities as a married man and his loyalty to his best friend Dupree (Owen Wilson), who needs a place to crash after losing his job and apartment. Of course, Dupree turns out to be a major pain in the keester. Wife Molly (Kate Hudson) tries to be understanding, all the while oblivious that her father (Michael Douglas), who is also Carl's boss, is trying to sabotage the marriage. It's no spoiler to reveal that everything turns out okay at the end.Although this film has its moments, there are too few of them. The story is predictable but unfocused. Wilson's considerable charisma is not up to the task of making Dupree a sympathetic character until late in the film, making it difficult to see why Molly warms to him. This film could make a decent rental, but there are much funnier movies to choose from."
2,Tests the limits of one's belief!,"This movie has too many scenes that are supposed to be funny, but aren't. Some are so unbelievable that you just roll your eyes, as for example...Warning: Spoilers follow...1) Dupree stays over at Carl and Molly's place ""just until he finds a job"", and does all of these things:(i) Has sex on the living room couch, when he knows that Carl and Molly are just coming over.(ii) Enters Carl and Molly's bedroom when they're having sex.(iii) Calls strippers home to perform.2) Dupree goes to a job interview and says he loves holidays, and that he hopes there's a ""Victory over Japan"" holiday. Obviously, he doesn't get the job. Surprise! Very funny!3) Father-in-law asks Carl to get a vasectomy within the first few weeks of the wedding. How vindictive can an in-law be?!The concept is good, but if only the comedy were a bit more believable, it might be all right."
2,Boring...,I found just a few laughs in this movie and I thought it would have been much funnier than it was. Seeing the previews as it looked like it would be hilarious and so I decided to go to the movies and watch it. I was very disappointed in this movie because there was only a couple laughs and this movie nearly put me to sleep. I allready knew that after only after a few minutes of watching.... no action and no comedy and boring scenes that this movie would be a waist of time. I really like Owen Wilson but this is certainly one of his worst films that he has made so far.
1,YOu and Me will HATE DUPREE,"I would rather have a root canel then watch this STUPID film again.I can't understand why these great actors agreed to do ""Dupree.""Even Michael Douglas?This DVD has to be over 2 hours of pure hell."
1,pure rancid s**t!,"i didnt laugh at all at this movie, i like that actor that was in 40 year old virgin, the rest of the cast is crap. i laughed harder when i saw a poodle getting splatted by an 18 wheeler. don't rent and definetly don't buy. in the name of hagar the elk god, im out"
2,Not as funny as we had hoped,"The movie has its moments, but they are not often enough to recommend this movie to others."
3,"You, Me, without Dupree","It was ok, but I guess I was expecting a bit more. Went a little over the top with the comedy to the point it lost some punch."
3,Just ok,"Most of Rotting Christ fans believe that this is their best record. Well i disagree -> check out Theogonia. This is another black metal album , i cant see what makes the difference."
4,"Revisiting ""Noir York City""","This sequel to Max Payne is just as good as the original. Graphics and bullet time has improved, but the gameplay is still pretty much the same. You get to kill a bunch of bad guys while in slow motion (or normal motion). The game does feel a bit short and the love story is at times uninteresting, but the action is intense & the look and feel of the game is dark and gritty (perfect for a game like this). The dialogue has improved, though some of it is still corny.It's too bad that this game is currently unavailable for the PC. Those who are new to Max Payne should be able to find a used copy or a brand new one on eBay or something. It's a top-notch third-person shooter.Grade: 8/10"
2,Okay but not really that great,"This is another installment for Max Payne, an awsome game that has been out for some time now, this game has awesome graphics the only problem I find is that it is way too short for the price, lets face it the price is a bit steep for such a short game, reminds me of Half Life Blue shift, another great idea for a game, a sequel that was way too short and much to costly. Otherwise I like this game!"
5,This game deserves an Oscar!!,"I never played the first Max Payne, you don't need too. This game is awesome. The story is awesome. The graphics are awesome. By far, my favorite game. And too be perfectly honest, I think the game is plenty long enough. The length of the game fits the story nicely. Anything longer would just seem to drag it out."
1,Re:I didn't like this-it was disappointing,"I loved ""Max Payne"". From the day I bought it, I was hooked. I finished it, and anxiously awaited the sequel. When It cam out, I played it over at a friends house. I still have not bought it. I was just disappointed with how they took the storyline. In the game, there's no mention as your playing, of the first game(unless you play the ""previously"" video in the game). Secondly, Max looks NOTHING like he did in the original! I can understand that times change, and I read how super looking max now is, compared to the original, but His looks didn't strike me as great. Medicore, I would say. And last but not least, if you don't have high specs for this game, don't even bother wasting your money, or downloading the demo(especially if your a dial up user). It's just not worth it. I'll stick with the original instead, this game, in my opinion blows goats."
2,Not a FPS [First-Person-Shooter] at all...,"This is a Third-Person-Shooter. As in a movie, you are looking over theshoulder of the hero. You are not THE hero. If that's what you'reinto then the game is fine, but if you're like me and want to BE thehero, then avoid this game.As with other similar games such as 'Stranglehold', product descriptionsleave out this aspect, an unforgiveable omission."
1,Just a one-day come and go hype game just like the first.,"Despite all these false and hyped reviews about how great the game is, not even a casual game player would buy this game. I'm glad I bought a used copy dead cheap and I'll be happy to sell it dead cheap on ebay after having only one day of enjoyment easily beating it even on the most difficult level."
4,Great game but too short,"If you played the first Max Payne then you're going to enjoy this but be warned it's short. The graphics are breathtaking and luscious. Gameplay is fast and the story helps to keep the pace up. A new bullet time feature is now part of the bag of tricks that Max has and Mona is perhaps the most gorgeous female PC character to come around since Lara Croft. Overall, I had a blast but I wished that there was a bit more than the 8 hrs. that I ended up getting from this game. If you haven't played the Max Payne series then pick up the first one as well and sit back for some fun!"
4,max dhamaka,"ya, it was great to have a review of this game. actually i am having part 1 of this cd and i can use no finer words than the best."
3,pretty fun game...,"I jus recently bought this game after seeing the new movie Max Payne which was awesome!!!!! I luved this game i couldn't stop playing it...it has a pretty intriguing storyline (so u wont want to skip the cutscenes) i had so much fun w/ the bullet-time feature, and experementing w/ which weapons i liked to use the most!!!! this game has really good graphics and amazing voice performances(or whatever u call it) by the entire cast!!!! the only reason i didn't give this 5 stars is cuz for me it has NO replayability level at all...it took me about 5 hrs to finish this game i had a blast the whole time...however once it was over i tried replaying the missions and i got so bored i quit and i'm probbly gonna get rid of this game...so if u jus want like 5 hrs of a hell of alot of fun and thats all then buy this game but if u want replayability buy CoD waw or a game like that...or watch the movie instead :P"
4,Max Payne 2 Review,"Game is essentially an add-on to Max Payne 1, which I also own. Payne 2 is much shorter than Payne 1. Pretty much the same weapons (except adding AK-47), bad guys, AI, graphics, slo-mo effect, etc. as in Payne 1. Utterances by bad guys were much more clever and entertaining in Payne 1, not so in Payne 2. Also, the environments, slo-mo death scene of baddies, and story line were more interesting in Payne 1. Thank goodness I only paid around $9 for the game. If you liked Payne 1, then Payne 2 is a short extension of it and you'll enjoy it somewhat."
5,"The best game of 2003, 2004 and likely 2005! Period.","Holy smoke, this game is simply awesome! Without a doubt the best game ever made so far!!! (running you of exclamation marks)Seriously, MP2 expands on everything that I loved in MP1. The graphics blow your mind away, the story is top-notch, the game play is the most polished ever and Bullet Time 2.0 rocks your socks off.Games don't get better than this! Stop reading now and buy your copy you dummy!"
4,It run on Windows 7,I loaded this game on Windows 7 to see if it would run. I was surprised with the results. It ran perfectly. I have seen reviews from other people having trouble do this. I am totally satisfied with the game and windows 7 compatibility.
3,"Fun, but nothing special...","Good game play and as fun as the original, however the dream sequences were a royal pain in the ass and completely disrupted the flow of the game.Is it just me or are the game makers taking heavy drugs whilst designing these games?????!!!!"
5,SO much fun!,"For some reason, I went into this worried that it wouldn't be as good as the original (since game sequels - as with most sequels - rarely are). Boy was I wrong! Though the believability of the storyline is stretched at times (I dislike when little-used characters from the previous incarnation take on incredible importance in a sequel), it was nevertheless a really well-done story.As for the gameplay, the constant starts and stops at the beginning (as you're getting into the story) can be a bit aggrivating, since you may find yourself thinking ""Hey, I would have rather done that myself, than had it shown to me through a cutscene!"" but that doesn't stop me from giving this 5 stars. My enjoyment well out-weighed any minor annoyance.It's an especially great bargain of a game now that it's under $15! Even if you didn't play the original (which I do recommend), pick this up - great, cheap fun."
4,The saga of Max Payne is here...With new twists,This time instead of doing section of section ill do Pros and Cons (not like my other reviews)==-Pros:-Deep play sequal-Great story like the original-Bullet Matrix Timming stop thingy (Bullet Time Mode)-MOD tools to create levels==-Cons:-Instead of thinking you just run and sh0ot. (The AIS arent good enough)-Shorter
3,What Just Happened??!??,"Gameplay for this game is impressive, good physics modeling with excellent graphics. The story line is compelling, well written, and the scripted bits are well done.I finished this game in less than 6 hours - so I am a bit disappointed by the length of play. $50 is a little steep for this short of gameplay. I do not see a replay value in this game as well, so be forwarned.It's fun while it lasts, it doesn't last long."
5,Unexpectedly wonderful,"The first time I picked up this book and read the inside flap, I put it back. Unbeknownst to me, my mother picked it up too and brought it home. She read it and then started raving about it, so I finally gave in and read it. For years, it was my favorite book, and I would pull it out once a year. The story is interesting, fast-paced, and romantic. The two sequels leave much to be desired, but this one is enough by itself."
5,great intro to uno,"My 5-yr old loves this game. He could play it for hours. Really, it's Uno lite in that there are draw 2 cards and wild cards. None of the other command cards or wild cards. However, it's such a great intro to the game, and I'm sure my son could transition well to the real thing later since he loves this one."
4,Great,"This sounds great in my UniValve. Still too damned loud, but I will be helping that by changing my 4x10 with a 1x12 (and maybe changing the pre and driver tubes). The only downside and the reason I am docking this by one star is that with the adapter and the EL84, you can no longer put the cage on the THD Univalve since the tube is too tall."
2,American Classic Western is no video classic,"I was really looking forward to viewing ""One Eyed Jacks"" which I consider one of the best Western movies ever made. I was very disappointed when I saw how poor the video quality was of this DVD. Maybe they tried to put too many movies on one disc? Anyway, save your money and buy ""One Eyed Jacks"" somewhere else."
2,Not so good.,"The book often does a poor job of explaining geophysical methods in a way that benefits the introductory student. At times it is very vague, especially when it comes to explaining the mathematics behind a certain method. I'm sure there are better books to use for an introductory geophysics course."
2,Longitudinal in shape and with UK unit system Book,"I was kind of disappointed with what I got. The print edition that I got was a very longitudinal narrow book. This shape to me was inconvenience. Another issue was the ending of sentences on the left pages were very close to the center of the book and the same with the starting of the sentences on the right page. I could have returned it and asked for the other regular version that my friend bought just a short while before me, but the semester already has begun and homeworks started to rain on me, so I didn't. The book is also written in the UK English the units system was totally different from the US one. I also noticed that the author had also altered the UK units system, like using Megagrams equivalent to Kilograms."
3,Good reliable watch,"Got this watch as a gift for my father. He wears this more than his Muhle Glashutte!Looks handsome but is a bit on the flashy side since the bracelet is polished. Keeps good accurate time and has a nice heft to it.Again, the bracelet feels quite cheap, but hard to find anything significantly better in this price range."
5,Invicta Speedway,I bought 3 of these Invicta Speedway watches. One Stainless with a white face (for daily wear) one two tone withe a white face and a two tone with a black face. Bottom line is I love the look of the Invicta line. The Speedway looks very similar to the Rolex Daytona albeit the dials and hands do work a little differently. Still I get lots of compliments on all three. They all work perfectly and I will be buying more Invicta products.
3,Invicta Gold-Tone Watch # 9224,"I have bought two other Invicta watches before for my two sons and I have been satisfied with them. This one, however, I am not completely satisfied. I was expecting the watch to be heavier than it actually is. It is relatively light. I hope the finish doesn't fade as time goes by. I can not figure out how to pull the time adjustment yet. I am going to have to bring it to a jeweler."
4,bom,Excelente produto! rápida entrega e ótima qualidade. Impressiona positivamente. Recomendo a aquisio desse produto pela beleza e presena que ele passa.
3,Dead battery,"The watch is very beautiful, but is a little smaller than I expected. What really annoyed me was receive the new watch with the dead battery. I had to change the battery to work. I would have returned because of the dead battery, but I had to travel and gave up."
4,Good buy,It's a good buy. It's not too pricy. My husband likes it. It looks good for women too as a boyfriend type a thing of watches. Worth every penny!
3,Lo degradante,"Me gustaría recomendar este libro a personas que tengan su nivel de autoestima por los suelos, ya que este libro es demasiado deprimente y a mi en lo particular me hizo sentir como una cucaracha que sido aplastada por toda la humanidad mas de cuatro veces. Salman es muy buen escritor, pero le falta algo para mantener interesada al lector, ese algo que le sobra a J.J. Benitez, creo que Rushdie tiene el potencial y hasta podría ser mexicano algun día(si le hecha ganas). Obviamente estoy aqui para recomendarles el libro, pero me gustaría serle franco al decirle que no se emocionen demasiado."
5,Excellent Unit!,"This is the type of product I enjoy when working on my favorite hobby...computers (fixing, upgrading, etc.). The power supplies are very easy to install and work flawlessly. I have already purchased 5 of these units for my various computer projects and they are all working great."
1,Massive Billing and Shipping issues,"I ordered this product in the hope of getting it in a week to 2 weeks. However, I had to deal with Amazon failing to charge my Credit Card the first time, then I saw that the listed date was 2 weeks MINIMIUM to receive the product which is totally rediculous. As a result of this issue, I am at a standstill on some of my work projects.Due to this subpar experience I will no longer use Amazon for online shopping."
2,Power Supply,"Item was either not compatible with my mother board, or a defective item. Not 100% sure which.If not compatible, Amazon sent wrong item.If defective, Item was suppose to be Brand New (according to the auction page).Either way, it put me 2 weeks behind on my project.Not happy."
1,Not As show on picture,I Purchase a Moeller Marine Tank with Fuel intake in aluminum as show in picture but received one that has a plastic one piece fuel intake that I have now find a way to make it work. Items to be more specific on there description.
1,Cut and Paste,"Shogan's book is a rehash of formerly published ill informed texts. His photos are commonly available and serve to mislead rather than inform--focusing on Sid Hatfield rather than Bill Blizzard. Despite the title, Blair Mountain does not make the index till page 184. Two points should suffice to give a gist of the quality of this work. He repeatedly refers to the Red Bandana Army--while any miner knows that no such fiction ever existed. It was the RED NECK Army, led by Bill Blizzard who later would lead District 17 to dominate the coal fields of West Virginia. Second, and of critical import, Mr Shogan did not even bother to interview William C. Blizzard. W.C. Blizzard is Bill's son, was in the court room when his daddy was acquitted, and wrote the only truly informed history of the Battle back in 1952! On the bright side, I purchased a new,hard bound, autographed, copy of this $26 book for $1.95 on Amazon."
4,"Report on ""The Battle of Blair Mountain""","Since I am a West Virginian, born near the scene of this account, I found it especially interesting and informative. I think it would make good reading for anyone, and very good for history buffs, or students of the labor movement."
3,Brief Biographical sketch of author's life,"I had the pleasure to see Ken Freeman at our church during a recent youth revival. It was during this rally that we purchased his book to help support his ministry. Ken does a good job chronicling his life and giving snippets about those to whom he's ministered in his career. I guess I think that when people invoke numbers in their evangelistic endeavors - there is a certain amount of ego that is wanting to be stroked. Ken's writing is a lot like his speaking: once you've seen him speak - you'll be more tolerant of his writing style. Overall, the book is a decent rendition of this evangelist's passion about ministry."
5,Offers Hope and Healing,This book is an awesome book that I would recommend to anyone who has past hurts that they are trying to work through. This book gives hope and insight into the Love of Christ and how He rescues us from our pasts.
1,What one would expect from a misguided attack on evolution.,"This book is probably the best of the so called anti-evolution books. Of course this doesn't say much, because this work also includes all the usual distortions and so on."
1,"Worthless, save your time, don't pick it up.",A worthless book full of unsubstantiated tripe. You could learn more about evolution & it's original gaps from a cartoon.
2,A shoddy case,"Johnson's a lawyer, so what is he doing trying to pass himself off as any kind of authority on biology? He presents arguments that look good on the surface but fall apart under close examination. And in more than a few instances, he ignores evidence so he can claim there is none. A dishonest book from a man out of his league."
1,the world is not flat,"I don't need to read books that theorize about the world being flat, nor about phrenology, nor about the ""benefits"" of cigarette smoking. At one time, people believed in all these things, but thanks to REAL scientific inquiry, we know these things just aren't true. Unfortunately, books like these are written by people with just enough knowledge to create convincing arguments to confuse people who don't know that much about science and the theory of evolution. If you have faith in god, that's wonderful. Be joyful in that. But don't buy into this pitiful attempt to fit a square peg into a circular hole to try and justify Creationism through science. It just doesn't work."
1,Same old tired story...,"Blah, blah, blah...I get so tired of reading the same old tired story: ""Darwin evil, Bible good."" This book seems to be filled with half-truths, mistakes, misunderstandings, and faulty logic. (I say ""seems"" because I just couldn't bring myself to finish it; the first few chapters, combined with selective samplings of the rest, demonstrated to me that there is nothing new here.) The main thrust of this entire book is basically a fallacious appeal to consequences.I'll have to agree with Eugenie Scott's review of the book: Johnson has too little an understanding of evolution and science in general to mount an effective attack.If you're interested in learning more about the fact and theory of evolution, read Gould, Dennett, Eldredge, or Dawkins. If you want to read a desperate, grasping-at-straws defense of comfortable childhood fables, read Johnson."
1,A confused look at evolution.,"For anyone interested in the creation/evolution debate, this books pretty much sums up the best creationists can do against evolution. While Johnson does not argue FOR creationism, it is pretty clear that he has that (or some form of it) in the back of his mind. Most of the issues he nitpicks are irrelevant, unresolved, or unimportant. His argument is above average for creationists - but goes nowhere in counteracting the arguments for natural selection and evolution"
4,Educated on the subject.,"An online reviewer ( from boulder, colorado December 14, 1999 ) shows a problem that Johnson is making an attempt to fix. People have stopped thinking. He writes "" scientists never, i repeat, NEVER attempt to distort facts."" -- this is simply not true, for this is elevating all ""scientists"" to god-hood, perfect beings, whom we must follow, for they always set the standard of truth. No, that of course isn't the case. I recommend that you read Johnson's book with an open mind. Be willing to tolerate differing ideas than what you have been told in the past. Think."
2,book packaging/mailing problem,i never received the book ordered due to (apparently) improper packaging. all i received was notification from the postal service that the product could not be delivered due to failure of the packaging. amazon.com needs to do a better job in packaging items for delivery so they will survive the mailing process.
1,Lies and Deceit,"This book is evil. It begins by mixing up the definitions of fact, theory, and hypothesis. Quotes are taken out of context and don't reflect their author's intended meaning. Authors have complained in writing only to see the same mistruths reappear in the 2nd edition. Science and the scientific community are falsely portrayed. Naturalism is substituted for objectivism and Darwinism for evolution. Without knowledge of paleontology or anthropology and how the scientific community really works, this book may sound very convincing."
1,The best way to discredit this entire book.,"I need to only say 3 things-1. Examining Johnson's sources and statements reveal an incredible amount of quote mining and misrepresentations.2. The bulk of ""arguments"" he's leveled against evolution have been answered extensively by the scientific community.3. Phillip Johnson is not a scientist. He is a law professor, and as such is better suited towards knowing how to lie convincingly rather than express facts accurately and without misrepresentations, as scientists do."
3,A Decent Summary of Intelligent Design Creationism,"The author, Phillip E. Johnson, has written a number of books advocating ""theistic science,"" and has been active in the fight to get ""creation science"" taught in the schools along side or in place of evolution. This book is as good a place as any to get an introduction to the ideas and contentions of contemporary creationism. As you will see, many of the ideas are retreads of old criticisms of Darwin's ideas, and their alternative ""theistic science"" is not developed at all. If you really want a ""Gee Whiz!"" book of unanswered questions in modern evolutionary theory, see Michael Behe's book, Darwin's Black Box."
1,An intelligent but dishonest attack on evolution,"While the arguments are well thought out and well presented, we once again see the typical anti-science stance of presenting the evidence against which the author can formulate an argument while ignoring the evidence which would diminish or destroy the author's arguments.This is a very dishonest book."
1,One of the funniest books I've read in years!!!,"This guy would make a good humor writer. I haven't laughed at a book so much in years! Evolution is supported by mountains and mountains of documented, irrefutable evidence from educated, professional, intelligent people who have simply followed the course of where their research took them. It's no longer about one guy who wrote one book in the mid-1800's. Not any more. Inform yourselves, people. I challenge anyone reading this to actually investigate how much supporting research there is out there for evolution in science, in astronomy, biology geology and physics. It's overwhelming. Check out some web sites from some universities and research institutes to get an idea of how research is being done on evolution all over the world. Do you think they're all in a conspiracy, and that they're just making it all up?"
3,Paint on Balls chips off,"I ordered this item for my 2yr old twin boys. They love the animals and understand that the ball goes through the hole on each one. However they don't care to hit the balls with the sticks but I'm sure that will come with time. I did find after only playing with it for about 30 minutes that the paint on the balls was already chipping off. The boys also found it easy and exciting to take the animals off the stands as they only set on top and are not held together with anything but does make for easy, flat, storage."
3,leximom,"Bought this for my daughter and she loved it. The first time we played the paint chipped off the balls, it did not take but a few strokes for it to happen. Looked like there was a couple layers of paint put on and one of the handles was bent. Next time we'll look for a more sturdy set."
3,animal croquet,unfortunatley the set was missing one piece. I contacted the vendor to ask them to either send the part or replace the set and they never responded back
1,incorrect parts,Amazon needs to update your info you called out the incorrect installation kit for my year truck had to return them and contact the maker of the running boards to get the correct installation kit
2,Save your money,I received my book 2 days ago and now I wish I wouldn't have ordered it. All it is is another copy of the instructional manual that came with the software. Save your money.
5,Great Book for beginners,"After reading this book, I developed two Dynamic web pages in three days. This was a large project within my group. I recommend this book to every beginners."
2,Not what i was hoping for,"Hey, Let me first declare that I am not a professional programmer. I have crossed from the ranks of the Graphic Design community and i was looking desperately for a book that was going to help me with some of the more challenging aspects of db integration, ie. advanced searches. This book is basically covered by documentation that comes with UD or at least info available from their web site or more to the point it is available through the MM (MacroMedia) newsgroup (via the MM website). In essence, wait for a better book to come out...if your not sure what is a better book...ask at the MM newsgroup. Hope this helped and not hindered, i am not setting out to destroy this authors work but maybe next time she will write a more challenging book."
1,Very shallow,"From a long term database admin / n-tier prospective, neither the product or the book work. My client picked Ultradev. The product and the book are targeted toward desktop publishing from the database. When using MS Sql Server, IIS and Internet Explorer 4.x, based on static html generated from Front Page there are problems. This book is for the meek and Ultradev is for the weak. The bottom line, use Oracle and Java and middleware. There are thousands of books and people who care about that. Use Dreamweaver for content and proof of concept database projects only."
5,Well worth the wait...,Ms. Bakharia does and outstanding job making UltraDev clear and concise. It is very well laid out and easy to understand. This is one of the better computer books I have ever purchased on any computer language.
2,Not worth the Money,"This book does provide a step-by-step quide to using Ultradev. Where it falls short, is the steps do not all connect and in some steps are hard to follow. You have to look at the fine print to see what to type. That is why I only gave it two stars. Overall I do not believe this book is worth the money! The user guide that comes with Ultradev is much better."
4,"Lovely game, but...","This game has everything a family needs for an evening of fun! Would have received five stars overall were it not for the fact that it arrived with one of the corners defective. The corners are apparently glued together, and one corner had come apart. 'Gave it as a gift and felt bad that the recipient had to glue the corner together upon receiving it."
5,Diamond in the rough from the 90's underground pop scene,"I found this CD in the late 90's and have not sopped listening to it since. Lyrically the songs are reminiscent of the Toadies. The music styling is an eclectic mix of pop, funk, jazz and fusion. A must listen and must buy to spice up any music collection."
4,DOE,The previous user has made pen markings allover the book.Apart from that the book is in O K condition.
2,"OK, but not so OK","I bought this book about three weeks ago and returned it to the mall. The book went over the materials OK, but there were many files from the CD that were missing, which really gets annoying if I just spent 2 hours on a tutorial, and theres nothing on the CD that came with the book! Don't BUY THIS!"
3,cd rom files,"Some of the cd rom files are missing; this will leave you dangling like a monkey for a while, not knowing what to do. How do you get the missing file? That beats me..."
2,BEGINNERS BEWARE Starts off good but ends badly,"This book has a couple of good chapters that are fun and easy to understand, but the other 8 chapters make you want to fall asleep. Chapters 1 and 2 cover the installation and basics of 3ds MAX ,which is very fun, but chapters 3-10 are just plain boring and hard to understand. The whole book basically is just one big tutorial that is confusing and boring. You actually start modeling on chapter 5 and by the time you get there you are just feeling confused and bored to death. This book is a very bad start if you're just a beginner and know nothing about 3d modeling. This book has many good reviews, but don't let the 5 stars fool you this book is plain crap."
5,The Only Choice for New MAX Users,"Spectacular! This is perect for the new MAX user. A comprehensive step-by-step tutorial demonstrating modeling, texuring, lighting, effects and animation. After reading this book you will have a strong understanding of all the capabillities of 3DS MAX. If you want to learn Max but are intimidated by MAX this is the book for you. The best software book I have ever bought."
2,Not for anyone but beginners,"I've had some experience with 3D programs, and decided, based on reviews that this was a book that would not only show me the basics, but also give an inkling of how MAXs' more advanced features worked. The basics? Yep - lots of it. The advanced stuff? Nope. Not even close. My advice is only buy this book if you have no idea what you're doing with [any] 3D program. All topics requiring skills from intermediate and upwards are covered very sparsely (if at all - there's no mention of NURBS!#?!). The featured artists in the book also have questionable 3D skills. ... is a lot of money for a book you're only going to need for 2 or 3 weeks. I recommend Rob Polevoi's '3D Studio Max R3 In Depth' for the beginner-to-intermediate user."
4,Good Set,"Some of the lesser known tracks are pointless but overall, it's a very enjoyable set with pretty much all of Donovan's classics included."
2,Mono???,"When I first looked over the list of songs on these 2 CDs, it looked good. When I played them, and looked at the notes, I wondered why most of the first CD is monophonic. All those early recordings were released in stereo, so why are these mono?Then I began to see the reason for 'previously unreleased' material being unreleased. The ones on these discs don't do much for me. 'Museum' is a case in point - the released version is better. That's probably why it was released, and I would rather have that version (in stereo).This set looks like a bargain, but I feel like I wasted my money."
3,A good collection but not all reproduced in stereo,"No doubt about it, this is a good set.Fantastic for the price but for one downfall. The majority of the songs are reproduced in mono not stereo.I personally feel that this is a definite problem. Donavon's music is deserving of better treatment than this.The most off putting thing about it, is that this information is not made known, I was unable to find any mention of it in the product description.Needless to say I was very disappointed when I received my copy and played it.Perhaps for those of us that want a better version there will be one available in the future. In the meantime I will keep the CD (I did consider returning it)and make the best of it."
2,An old hippie hoped for more.,"I was so disappointed in this CD. Only a few of my most loved songs are on it. It was a gift. I was just dying to hear it. The songs I am not familar with I disliked, I am sorry to say. I guess this old hippie is too old to know how much he changed since the 60's. If I was to pick a gift over again, I would buy his first two albums. Sorry that I do not have more information. I only listened to it once because I thought it was cheaply done and thrown together. Truthfully, I couldn't bare to listen to it again unless I edited out most of the songs."
1,Strictly for devotees,"Sometimes, a career retrospective compilation works well for an artist with a long, but spotty career. In this case, I don't think so. The songs that you may have remembered from the '60s sound dated enough for the next Austin Powers sountrack. The rest are pretty bad. No hidden nuggets here."
3,Universal Soldier,"I am a fan of Donovan and have enjoyed reading all the reviews of his albums, CDs, boxed sets, etc. However, I am also a fan of Buffy Sainte-Marie, and I so I think it would be nice if all the people offering reviews of Donovan would check their facts and stop giving him credit for writing Universal Soldier. UNIVERSAL SOLDIER WAS WRITTEN BY BUFFY SAINTE-MARIE!!! She also wrote Codine, which appears on the new boxed set of Donovan (from an early demo)."
3,Not Definitive Enough for Me,"Always enjoyed Donovan's music- simple, sweet, nothing too profound - music for its time, back in the day. I was very excited upon hearing about this release only to be disappointed. Disappointed, not by what's on it but by what isn't on it! None of the songs he did for the motion picture ""BROTHER SUN SISTER MOON"" are here or the 2 or 3 songs he did for the New Age Documentary, ""ALIENS FROM SPACESHIP EARTH"". Very much a 'bummer'."
5,Different type of Sci-Fi,"The Clone Republic was not your typical sci-fi with aliens taking over the world. It showed the darkness of humanity and the dark future of the United States. It also showed the treatment of clones by the naturally born people. All the clones were for was battle and nothing else. This shows the type of discrimination that could go on with the use of clones. This was great book, and I think all sci-fi fans should read it."
1,A Major Disappointment,"I've been reading SciFi for more than 50 years and I think this is one of the worst pieces of SciFi I've ever come across. As far as I'm concerned, the plot was tissue paper thin, the dialog was trite, the science was weak ... you name it. I can't think of one nice thing to say about the book. I certainly won't read the rest of the series."
5,The Clone Republic,"When I was in the USMC we were all told about the 'Old Corps', when real men were Marines...not wimps like us in the New Corps. Steven Kent has created a 'New Corps' without men at all, fearless clones. Old Corps or the New Corps Kent gets it right...""Semper Fi' Do and Die!"" The good news is that this is a great read, the better news is that there is a sequel, the best news is a series of six."
3,My Two Cents,"It's a couple hundred years in the future, and humans have spread out and colonized the entire Milky Way galaxy, ruled by the Unified Authority. A separatist movement has sprung up and the UA's military (made up largely of clones) is sent in to quiet it. One clone, however, is different than the rest. And it is this difference that gets him some unwanted attention from unfriendly UA leaders.I'm not a big reader of Science Fiction novels, but thought I'd give something different a try. Decent enough story but suffers from little-to-no character development of anyone besides the main character. Not knowing the motivations of any of the secondary players makes the conflicts seem forced."
1,A major editorial problem,Pages 293 through 324 appear twice in the bookChapters one through 3 caught my interest. Unfortunately the first time those pages appear they replace chapters 4 and 5 which appear nowhere in the book.As near as I can find there is no online way to contact the publisher.
4,Promising series,"A friend, fellow kindle owner, recommended this book. I was not displeased. Mr. Kent has a good first book with a interesting premise. The characters are interesting and by the middle of the book three dimensional. The science used is not overly explained, like so many authors do, and Mr. Kent provides enough explanation to suspend belief, which is the mark of a good author. Totally enjoyable read. Oh and Mr. Kent, Wayson rocks!!"
4,The birth of a war,"This book, about a Marine called Wayson Harris, is really a series of short stories/vignettes put into novel form that tell the story of the Unified Authority's lapse into war.As a main character, Harris is interesting. He's making the best out of rotten situations he keeps finding himself in. If he weren't likable, the jump from story to story is the sort of literary device I just can't stand.I thought this was a nice don't have to think too hard sort of beach book. I'll be seeking out others in the series."
4,"The Clone Republic - Great Book, Bad Title","After passing this book series up multiple times I decided I would give it a chance. The Clone topic just did not seem very interesting. However, reading this book turned out to be a great choice! I was very pleasantly surprised by some of the twists and turns in the plot while still feeling like I had a grasp on the direction it was going. I liked how the author tied in deep space and far off planets with Hawaii and other items closer to home and more familiar to me. I think the story telling was very interesting, the characters believable and the book very enjoyable! I am very glad I read this book in-spite of the uninspiring title. I recommend it whole heartedly."
2,Clone Republic - just an OK read.,"I thought this book would be so much better (and the next one) - so I bought the first three books in the series.It wasn't bad -- I just got tired of every character in the book talking about the ""damned Liberator clone"" , which were supposed to be super stud clone warriors. Some bad stuff happened in the past with this line, but this guy just doesn't make the grade. I kept hoping he would start demonstrating his superiority, but...he really didn't. So the canned reactions just got to be boring.Read the other reviews, you may like the book. I for one, really enjoyed John Scalzi soooo much better!Old Man's War"
5,The Beach Boys Love You,"This is a fun album for hardcore Brian fanatics. Such a quirky, underrated album. Like Smiley Smile, all of the songs are written by Brian himself. Like Pet Sounds, it's a solo Brian Wilson album featuring the Beach Boys. It doesnt get any better than this. God, please let us go on this way and listen to Love You forever."
4,Heartbreaking True Story,This is a beautifully written story from the heart. The author tells about going through a life altering experience and what it is like to come out on the other side. This was a local event that was highly publicized. It is like reading someone's private diary. This is a courageous man who shows that forgiveness is the only way you can move forward with a tragic event such as this. God Bless.
5,Inspirational,Well written and captivating. Could sense what the author endured as he faced this life atlering event. The author reveals his inner being and struggles as he attempted to continue without the love of life.
3,Not for small hands...,"My 6 year old son received this as a gift and went nuts - part of the fun (for him) was actually removing the 30 or so twistie ties from the back. Anyway, he loved it until he tried to pose it and it pinched his hand and he screamed for about 5 minutes (this coming from a bmx, skakeboard ""tough guy""). So beware for little hands!"
4,Spidey Toy,"I loved the movie SPIDER-MAN 2, so naturally this, above the plethora of spidey toys caught my attention and this is a great addition to my already huge collection of movie memorabilia. This SPIDER-MAN toy by TOYBIZ is a great collectable for the comic book enthusiast who likes impressive figures for displaying, and the amount of articulation is really cool. However this is not a particularly suitable toy for kids; it's heavy, cumbersome and since the movement is so extensive, the joints are somewhat fragile. The paint job is good though, and the amount of detail is welcome. Overall, a cool collector's item that looks very cool on my display shelf."
5,The Best Toy I Ever Had,I got this spider-man at the mall last sunday.He is super cool and this is the best is there is on spider-man 2 toys.
3,not for play,"This toy was a big disappointment. It's too heavy for a child to play well with. What's worse is that the upper portion quickly disconnected from the abs and could not be put back together since the design is poor. You can't fix it. Also, some of the joints are tough to move, requiring force. Not a toy for children to play with at all."
2,Save the box and the receipt,"We bought this toy and found that it was too heavy, too complex, and would not hold a good pose. Also, web-shooting wrist adapter doesn't work well at all, and does not fit wrist. Save your money."
5,Articulating Spiderman,"My Articulating Spiderman I am pleased with it For the most part of it. The seller never stated that the head was broken . I don't think that it was broken during shipping. I think the seller just neglected to tell me. You know make that sale. I was able to fix it but it's the fact of the matter, you won't my money. Tell me what I'm buying Keep it legit. No fault but Amazon.com."
2,Avoid the abridged audio version,"The abridged audio version does not do justice to this book. I have read other books by this author, and I enjoy his flowing prose and rich detail. The abridged version is disjointed and confusing. It omits so much material that it is difficult to follow the story. There are awkward pauses by the narrator. I like to listen to books while I commute, but unfortunately that is not a good option with this book. If you want to enjoy the book, I suggested reading an unabridged version."
3,Audio Abridgement Is a Tough Sell,"Whenever you produce an abridged version of any book, there is a risk that you'll edit out things which end up being not just relevant, but even critical to full enjoyment of the work.That's pretty much the case here.There is so much encyclopedic material in the full book that the abridgement loses way too many references. The result is, unfortunately, that the devoted reader misses pieces which are really crucial to understanding the huge picture of crime and criminals being painted here.""Pentimento."" I'd recommend skipping the abridged audio version and reading the whole book instead."
4,Public Enemies,"I very much enjoyed Public Enemies. I took it me while I traveled, and it entertained me during a very long flight. It's length is just right. I am very interested in the beginnings of the FBI and in J. Edgar Hoover. The book jumped around somewhat among the different groups of public enemies and forward and back in time and thus was occasionally a little difficult to keep up with, but it always held my attention. It was extremely interesting. What I found most intriguing was how inept the FBI was at that time and the turf battles between the local police and the FBI. Hoover's egotism is well known, but some of the descriptions of his behavior were surprising. Public Enemies was a page turner for me, and I highly recommend it."
5,A great read for any true crime enthusiast!,"I am a true crime book fan. As good as the subject matter is, a lot of books end up being very dry. Not in this case. I read this book in three days. This book does a really good job of transporting you to that era. It is written very objectively, and does a nice job of covering all of the Feds and Yegs of that era from Dillenger to J. Edgar Hoover. The author kept the information at a great pace and it never went dry. I recommend this book to the beginner reader to the collector. it is just that good."
3,Long Story,"I had read the rave reviews and looked forward to reading this book in it's paperback edition, but I was disappointed with it. The author tried to make a story out of this book, but it reads like a list of facts. I never knew much about the public enemies in the book, only the stories in the movies or legend of the famous names but not the true story. This book has given me all of the facts and more than I was interested in. I struggled to complete it but I did complete it. It's interesting how the FBI was formed to fight this war on crime and the public enemies were certainly vicious. But it's just too long and too factual for me. This is a good book if you like reading standard history text books. It certainly has all of the facts. If I was writing a college paper on any of these public enemies, I would use this book as my source."
2,Pennsylvania teacher's thoughts,"Public Enemies was difficult for me to get through. There were so many gangsters and related folks, I could not keep them all straight. I found it rambling and convoluted."
2,A pro criminal book,"This book is disappointing. It takes an anti FBI, pro criminal stance. The author appears to hold criminals in a higher esteem than the Law Enforcement agents who risked their lives to protect our citizens. Burrough could have done much better."
5,Great Tinnitus Therapy,"This CD is all nature and no music - very therapeutic, especially for Tinnitus. And it's relaxing rather than obnoxious, as some can be."
3,ok,it was delivered prompted aand it worked the movie itself is not good but the seller did his part.
1,Game Pieces Need Help!,"Our family has always loved the game ""Sorry!"" - the kids also really like anything Disney. So when I saw this Disney Sorry! game at the store, I was thrilled! The fact that it was a few dollars more than original Sorry! didn't bother me. I was so disappointed when I brought it home to find that the game pieces that you move around the board are made of cardboard and have to be attached to little plastic pieces to stand up. Boy, for a few bucks more the makers of Sorry! could have made some nice game pieces (similar to Monopoly, maybe) that wouldn't get lost or torn. This was a great idea, done on the cheap."
2,Sorry,The game pieces are different characters that you put into a place holder and move them around the board. They are to big and tippy so the kids keep knocking them over. The orginal game had smaller more stable pieces. Very frustrating to try and keep track of where the pieces go. I liked that the new rules on the cards made the game different and quicker than the orignal.
5,Colorful and Fun,"I've had 2 other Special Edition Sorrys and I really like this one. The game board is colorful and entertaining. If you love Disney characters, then the game pieces are a real treat. However, just a warning - the cardboard pieces do easily slip out of their holder, but it's workable. The cards are easy-to-read and easy to follow. They are different from the usual cards and you have special instructions. For example, pick a 'special' number in your player color and you could immediately reach 'home base' or have a chance to pick 3 extra cards. The game is very colorful and fun."
4,Disney Characters Add to the Fun,"I have never played Sorry before. I usually find board games to be ""bored"" games. This one was fun and not too complicated. I played the game with my 13 year old daughter and 8 year old son. We all had a good time. The Disney characters added to the fun of the game but I have to agree with another reviewer that the pieces are filmsy and might not last too long. It is nice to have a game that can be played by children of different age groups. This game has enough strategy to be enjoyed by older children and adults but it is simple enough for a younger child to play too. Overall I think this was a good investment for family entertainment and a chance to spend time together."
3,the stupids have a ball,This book is about Mr. & Mrs.Stupid and their kids; Petunia and Buster stupid have a silly costume ball. I liked this book because the stupids are always so funny and they do everything different and wrong. This book would be good for a girl or boy 10 and under who wants a laugh.This book has funny and great illustrations.It is an awesome series.
4,Kremer has produced another winning collection,"Violinist Gidon Kremer and his talented ensemble, Kremerata Baltica, have been producing fresh interpretations of classic and contemporary classical works for some time now. This release is no exception.The idea behind ""After Mozart"" is a simple one but produces wonderful results. The music features compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (and his father, Leopold), as well as latter-day composers inspired by him. Raskatrov, Silvestrov and Schnittke are among the composers featured.As usual with this ensemble, the music is bright, brilliant, and a true celebration of the compositions. I could have done without the inclusion of ""Eine Kleine Nachtmusik"" (a nice piece of music but soooo overexposed), but otherwize the selections are wisely chosen. Bravo to Kremer and his musicians."
1,Piece of Junk,"Nothing more I can add to the reviews that have already submitted, other than my personal experiences. The product appeared promising, but problems arose immediately after unpacking the box. The device has multiple plugs adapters for European power sockets, but I was missing the standard US 120V plug. Not a fantastic start.Emailing Joytech yielded no joy. It took them 5 business days to respond to my first email. The response was basically that I was SOL. They had stopped manufacture of the Control Center, thus they could not fix their mistake. I replied asking if they could just send a power adapter of the same voltage from one of the other devices they made, but after waiting another 3 days I was given the same answer. ""We're sorry, but it is out of our power.""I was able to find a universal adapter that worked for some time and the product worked for a time, but after 13 months of use, the power button stopped responding.As was mentioned in another review, you pay for what you get."
1,Might not work with HD to Analog TV convertor boxes.,"I bought this AV adapter just for my analog tv, DVD player, and Insignia HD convertor for analog tv. The problem I have with the device, it won't work with my HD convertor. I can only receive HD audio signal but no video for the tv. The DVD player works fine. So, back to the store it goes. I might try Philips PH-61153 instead."
3,not needed for step 1,"this book is too detailed for the step, a better books is brs physio.i read the whole section on neuro, it was very detailed but not once did i come across such info on my boards. Stick w/ brs physio unless u are trying to become a physiologist.I made a 229/95 on my boards reading brs physio, pocket robins, lipincott biochemistry, first aid, high yield anatomy mainly, then skimmed through high yield embryo and histo. Even though i read katzung for pharm it was a waste of time as first aid is more than adequaate."
4,Facts,"Full of facts and terms and not for everyone, but for those who want to know more about anatomy and functions of the body as a whole, the student who wants to learn, a keeper."
4,does the job,"good illustrations, worded well. This a concise text, the author lays it out in understandable terms. If you plan on selling it after the semester check before purchasing this book to make sure your school does not offer a free online version."
4,"Excellent text, Ganong Medical Physiology","After reading some chapters I arrived at the conclusion that is a very easy-reading book. It lumps all topics together. I found only an objection, some related topics are set on different chapters."
2,Compressed to the HILT,"This abomination has been ""hammered"" as they say. I thought it sounded odd on first listen, as though they had almost been re-recorded.....it turns out that this was one of the first of a long line of releases to have the files compressed so that the final product is LOUD. Now that the 2009 remasters have been in the stores for about 3 years, you can hear the music the way Lennon produced it."
2,$$$$$$$$$$$??????????????????,"If you don't have these Lennon tracks,, get the box set. This is nothing but a money grab. What a shame that someone of Lennon's integrity has to be whored in this way. Yet another comp of John's work. Great music, but bad karma"
4,The Most Complete You'll See Outside of the Box Set,"The song selection on these two discs span Lennon's amazing solo career and includes some rare and live gems that are worth buying the album for.I must say, however, that this disc is probably not for hardcore Lennon fans, especially if you have already purchased the Lennon Box Set from a while back.My only point of contention with this album is that the ""hit"" songs should have been interspersed between to the two albums to allow more casual listeners a chance to listen to the entirety of both discs rather than listening to disc one ad infinitum."
3,listen to all,"How can you review a compilation? John Lennon was a working class hero. And as such, you must listen to all of his music not just a ""best of"". Those young ones who weren't around at the beginning, and I was just a ""young one"" at the time of action, must place themselves in the late history of Viet Nam, the raging '60's, and the hope of JFK's administration.John was ahead of his time.Check out ""Crippled Inside"" what a great song. It does say it all."
3,"5 stars for the music, 3 for the idea of yet another collection","Let's be honest- you can't make a definitive collection for a guy like John Lennon. Not when there's over 90% of his discography that's worth hearing and owning. The only possible way a collection like this can be complete is when 90% of his legacy has been included. Anything less than that is really not worth owning. You mine as well just buy his regular studio albums when so many of his best songs have been left off his collections. With that said, what we have here is really good despite not being an essential purchase. You will recognize many of the songs, because they've become important pieces of music over the years, but let's just buy Lennon's studio albums instead."
5,These guys are great!!,"Being that Sicboy is a local band from where I live, I have been able to follow their careers more closely. And its great to see that they have a cd out and available everywhere. This is a wonderful debut for a band that is quite original, and experimental. Songs like Hang Up, Ink, Ruth's Song etc. are a real change of pace for a band known more for its straight ahead hard rocking sound. However, I must confess that its songs like Glass Roots, Fever, and the opening Myself that really are catchy, and stay imprinted in your mind for quite some time. Definetly pick up this CD and if you're lucky enough, check out one of their live shows before they are huge!!!"
3,"Good, but not as good as Tease.","Artificial Flavors is a decent debut, but the new EP is a real progression over their older material. Worth a listen, and its interesting to hear how much this band has evolved since this disc. There is also a lot of originality and interesting musical choices... although the production could be better."
5,I love it!,"This cd rocks! I found out about these guys on mp3.com, and downloaded a couple tracks, and had to get this cd. Its really aggressive in spots, and laid back in others. But for a debut I think its really great! If you don't have this cd get it! And you can get some cool free stuff if you join their street team too."
1,"A trendy, mediocre release from a trendy mediocre band.","I got a copy of this from a friend who is ""big"" into indie bands on the 'Net. I was sorely disappointed and I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it. This band wears their influences on their sleeves. It seems like they already have it in their minds to be a commercial marketing machine. If I wanted mainstream, I would've gone to Newbury Comics or Strawberries. In short, blech! Don't bother with this one."
4,ONE MORE TIME,By this time The Cantons had gotten rather formulaicHowever they got over by bring Albertina Walker out and honoring herThat part was worth the price of the disc and the dvd
3,Big Words from Little Mouths!,"My three year old loves this book. While he recognized some of the items (jets and kite), it was fun for him to learn new words for the alphabet (Einstein, Uranus) beyond the usual. And what a kick to hear those sophisticated words out of his little mouth! Along with the new words, the pictures drove his desire to review this book over and over again."
4,Almost as fun as the movie!,"I bought the soundtrack after recently viewing 'Mystery Men.' I can't believe I had never heard about this movie until this year! It's great! The cast has chemistry, with individual comedic styles coming together to blast you into a weird, funny world. The soundtrack only reminds me of the funny scenes I'll never shake out of my mind. My favorite song, by Citizen King, was so appealing that I bought their album, too. Even if you haven't seen the movie, the album is worth buying. It's an amusement park ride of rhythm and beats that you may never hear together again."
4,No Longer A Mystery,"I had to wonder why so many of the good songs heard in the movie were omitted from the soundtrack on audio cassette, but then I remembered that movie soundtracks are often vehicles whereby nameless artists become known. How well-known can depend on the movie to which the soundtrack applies (though not always). So it's no longer a mystery to me that Wild Cherry's 'Play That Funky Music (White Boy)' and A Taste of Honey's 'Boogie Oogie Oogie' were omitted from the compilation in favor of tracks by artists like Freak Power, Spy, Citizen King and those perpetual soundtrack-surfers, Moloko. Nevertheless, the soundtrack redeems itself with its inclusion of the Trammps, the BEE GEES, and 'Invisible Boy'-Kel Mitchell's catchy foray into rap backed by the M.A.F.T. EMCEES featuring Romaine Jones. Enjoyable."
4,:-) A Good Soundtrack,"A good one, especially as soundtracks go. got a lot of the cool music in the movie, but they should have included the wonderfully cheesy ""A Fifth of Beethoven"" (disco-beethoven)... you know, from when the shovel guy fights the disco dude. Its in the movie but not on the soundtrack."
3,The movie was great,"Seduced by evil was a great movie, The first time I watched it made me want to buy it, I love the sex scene with Suzanne and the Shamen, it was exciting, the movie is worth watching."
5,"Poi Dog, How do I love the, let me count the ways...","PDP is my all time favorite band, from my first live show in 1990 in a cafeteria-like college bar to today (1999!). I have been continuously thrilled by the dozens of people that seem to be on stage, the highest energy around, the smart, evocative lyrics, the unique instrumentation... I recommed any Poi album, but I think Volo Volo is the most accessable to the pop crowd. I loved The Hardest Thing and Lackluster from the moment I heard them. THT has fabulous, moving lyrics that touched my heart and the boisterous opening to Lackluster can quicken anyone's pulse. Buy this CD! Then buy the rest of the PDP collection. You won't be disappointed."
3,Missing Info,"Ordered three of these and they work well. However, would have been nice if the description told you they needed a battery for the remote and what kind of battery was needed. Remote is useless without the battery."
4,Works great,"works great.The only thing to note is the included instructions lists one battery type, but it is incorrect.Take the remote with you cause you'll need another battery size."
5,I'm in love......,"My husband and I saw an Eros music video in Munich a few weeks ago, I loved the song even though I couldn't understand sentence one. What I admired most in the video was that the audience was made up of children to seniors and everyone knew the words and was enthralled w/the performance. 9 is the first of his CDs that's arrived and I cannot stop listening to it even though the song we saw/heard isn't even on it. If I never hear music from other artists again I won't feel any loss.....I am definitely in love.....ready to pack it all up and move to Italy w/all my dogs!!"
4,Eros is back to form,Not only if you like Eros's previous albums not even if you like Italian music i reccomend you to buy this album. At first i thought it was quiet poor but after a few times it got better a sure YES for music lovers!
2,A Return to Form,"I think Eros is the most consistently talented popstar since ABBA were at their peak. Saying that, I must confess that his previous CD Stile Libero was a disastrous failure with its overblown pretensions of Self Important-Megastardom. The duet with Cher ? C'mon.Nove is a sad work. It compares in mood to Springsteen's Tunnel of Love. Nevertheless the songs are beautiful in their simplicity and are extremely well executed.Not at the same level as Dove C'e Musica or In Ogni Senso, but still excellent"
5,Bravo Eros!,"I'm an italian american and am a musician...i've been listening to eros ever since he came out and he really comes out with amazing albums...i wouldn't say this is his best work, but its damn close...too bad that america doesn't really know about him, because he is some artist...i personally think he is Italy's # 1 artist...his melodies, arrangements, voice and that bluesy eros feel is a pleasure to listen to even if you don't understand Italian...i had a chance to meet him at a show in the states, and he was very cool...He makes me feel proud to be Italian...Bocelli is also a great artist but eros will take him overall...if there was an artist that i could play with, eros would definitely be one of them..."
2,Nazal twain.,"It would be great to hear Eros sing without a nazal twain, or as a voice coach would refer to as 'singing through the nose'. With each album it seems to be more noticeable.All who like the voice and style of Eros should hear Antonio d'Onofrio, from Milan, sing. Unbelievable!!!!Maxximillioné"
5,Great music,Great songs by a great singer. I encourage non-italian speaking people to obtain a translation of the lyrics to better appreciate the value of the work.
4,I don't know how he does it...,"Never has a song managed to bring me to tears in such a vulnerable way, but 'Canzone Per Lei' did it, for some inexplicable reason. I haven't been married, so haven't suffered the pain of divorce and separation from a child (which is what the song is about, right?), but the song just breaks my heart every time I listen to it. I literally bawl like a toddler with a scraped knee! Must be the achingly beautiful way he sings, because I just don't know how else to explain it. Bravissimo, Eros!"
3,poor sound quality,"bought this for rare recordings. sound is worse than a toy radio, no bass and very distorted"
2,Dated and more an advertisement,This book was more an advertisement by the author for the Swiss advising company he works for than a comprehensive book on the subject. It is also out-of-date. It had some useful points but you would want to read it alongside other books on the subject for broader perspective.
5,Does its job.,"This great little device is a tribute to Bissell's designers. It successfully does exactly what it was designed to do (i.e., clean up pet spots on carpets)with minimum effort by the user. I use it almost every day due to my 16-year-old Yorkshire terrier's virtual Alzheimer's condition through which he can't remember if he is indoors or outdoors. It is worth every penny of its cost."
4,Good if you have no space,"This thing is nice if you have no space to store a real one.It will clean up a spot about 1 foot by 3 feet.However, if you want to do a whole room, buy a big one, its way easier."
1,short battery life,"I used this spot cleaner nearly every day for about 2 months, because i tend to a cat that has pooping issues and will only poop on the carpet, no matter how many times i discipline it. Anyways, the battery is dead now, and its now going to make its way to the trash. It worked well while it lasted, but its short battery life makes it uneconomical. I feel bad for being wasteful and trashing it, and Bissell should feel worse for selling a product that goes strait to a landfill. Come on, think green people! This is the last time a purchase a product from Bissell, since i cannot trust them to be responsible in this global warming time we live in."
1,A Dog Owner's Friend,"I've been pleased with this appliance. Quick and easy to use. Improves my relationship with the dog. Eighteen, nineteen, twenty."
4,Bissell Spotlifter,This is a redesigned version of an earlier model that I replaced. After two years of service the previous model spray malfunctioned and the vacume fluid container came apart. It is such a handy device that I went ahead and replaced it. The newer model seems to be beefed up in some respects and has a larger brush. It does a good job of spotting carpet and small pet mishaps.
4,"Yes, it comes with cleaning solution","I wondered; I bought some; now I have two. :)For what it is, it does a surprisingly good job. Lest you think you're getting a shampooer, here's the cleaning action: you mist the surface to be cleaned, and then you use this to suck the solution back out. There's no agitation, no ""vortex"" effect, just misting followed by suction. That said, it did a surprisingly decent job of removing soy sauce from my car's upholstery."
2,Does not work on shag carpeting,"I bought this for the sole purpose of cleaning a shag area rug in the living room of my wood-floored apartment. (My rescue dog occasionally decides to go to the bathroom indoors on this green shag carpet, which probably was not the most intelligent purchase on my part, since it bears a strong resemblance to grass.) I used the product exactly as described, and it did not pick up one drop of the water/cleaning solution that had been sprayed into the rug. I sprayed again and tried again, and then it picked up a few drops of water but nothing close to the 2-3 cups that I estimate had been sprayed into the rug. Maybe this product is not intended for this kind of carpeting, but I can't find that information anywhere. You may have better results with other types of carpet. It's also kind of heavy and awkward to use, with the brush on the bottom of the unit, so you have to kind of slide it back and forth along the floor to scrub."
5,Handy Helper,"I purchased this item when I moved my adult Boston Terrier into an apartment for the first time. It was replacing one of the earliest model SpotLifters that I had been using for years. I thought we might have ""adjustment"" problems, and we did.This little cleaner does a better job of cleaning than my big machine! Lifts spots quickly and easily.My dog has adjusted and now I just use it for human ""accidents"" around the house. With a 17 yr old and all his friends, we have plenty. It has picked up everything: potting soil, ice cream and even pizza!At this price I wouldn't live without one in the house!"
2,Leaks like a Seive,"After owning the predecessor to this model for five or six years with no problems whatsoever, we were extremely dissappointed to find that the replacement model has dropped so far in quality. This new machine leaks water from every orofice; the back end near the reservoir, the spray trigger, and even blows water out of the motor vents. The spray nozzle puts out two thin strips of water on either side of where you are aiming and nothing in the middle where its really needed. I am ready to throw this model away and get a Genie."
2,Poor suction,"If I want to do a steam clean, I should have opted for a bigger, not handheld vacuum. It basically has no steam even you fill the tank with hot water and solution. Ok to do some simple pick up."
2,Looks great but....,"The unit looks great and its compact size made it a dream compared to the Little Green, however I never got the chance to use this machine. The Cleaner Solution tank does not properly ""lock"" back in and was always loose causing it to fall out anytime you moved the machine. After noticing this I didn't even bother to use it as I could only imagine the mess I would have had to clean up. Back in the box and back to Amazon..."
3,Great for specific spots and small carpeted areas,"I bought this to get rid of some of the pet stains on the carpet. It worked wonders in getting up some of the major spots that I had. I would definitely recommend it for small areas and for immediate use on spots, but if you have a big house with a lot of carpet and a lot of spots, it would be best to spend the extra money and get a large carpet cleaner as opposed to the hand-held versions. Also, it took several once-overs to get out some older stains, but I guess that is to be expected."
3,Fits its purpose,We bought this machine to clean up the frequent messes of a cat with a weak stomach... Its done a good job on spot removal...I havent had any problems with leaks or anything like that... As long as you follow the directions it works quite well...
5,Great Little Unit,"This little unit works for small spots and pet stains. Lightweight, easy to use but very effective. Holds a charge for a long time."
4,good for what it does,"this little wet vacum does what it says it does. Don't expect it do more than clean up some spots, and the suction is good for its size.Emptying the dirty water isn't really straightforward, unless I just am doing it wrong."
2,It's okay.,"It was okay, but I didn't think it cleaned very well and kept leaking water. More a pain then helpful."
3,Ok for the price,I bought this for $40 and for the price it's alright. The suction isn't the greatest and you have to go over a spot 100 times before it gets the spot or spill up but for $40 and with it being handheld I guess it's ok.
2,Disappointed,I don't really see the point of this. I thought it would make clean up after my 8 month old easier but I think it is harder with this thing. All it does it suck up the cleaner. I thought that the brush would spin and therefore assist in cleaning up the spot but it is stationary so you have to rub back and forth. I find it easier just to use a wash cloth and a spot cleaner.
3,OK performance but not nearly as good as a full size cleaner,"We bought the Spotlifter to tend to a new puppy in our house. The Spotlifter does a fair job of quickly extracting spills but afterwards the carpet is still fairly damp compared to a full sized corded rug cleaner. As far as the battery power goes, a single charge is enough for about two to three spills before it loses suction and needs to be re-charged - not bad peformance for a portable in my mind. All in all the Spotlifter was a good choice for a portable but keep in mind that the big cleaner needs to come out periodically to get the deep down stuff out."
2,One fatal flaw that overrides genius. Would not buy again.,"Would not buy again. The problem isn't the cleaner -- it does what it should do, and beautifully. The problem is CLEANING the cleaner itself. It is the Rubik's cube of mini vacuums. Once you put on gloves (pet waste hazard), separate the body from the housing, take it outside to empty and use bleach to prevent mold from growing inside (you can see the mold everywhere if this isn't done pretty soon after you use it), it has to dry out so you can use it again. This takes at least a day...this is a very high maintenance cleaner. I need a nap just explaining this."
1,Short Life Span,These work ok for a year or so but ultimately the battery charge doesn't hold. It lasts shorter and shorter amounts of time and finally not at all. I tried emailing Bissell about this but I was told there was nothing past a year. So as long as you see this as a disposable you are ok.
1,Doesn't have enough power.,"I bought this so I could more easily clean my carpeted stairs. Unfortunately, while it could spray the liquid out, it didn't suck it back up. I was only able to collect about a tablespoon of liquid back into the machine. It seemed to only have about as much power as a dust buster."
5,We love our spot lifter,This is great for picking up the stains our kids and cats make. It has been a life saver for us. The only down fall it has is the limited running time. If you have a lot of stains at once it can run out of power and it takes hours to fully recharge and you can not run it while plugged in. But other than that we have no complaints. For all the positives it is worth this negative. :)
1,Useless,"This item is fairly useless. The spray is inaccurate, the brush is stationary so to get any effect you have to move the entire unwieldy machine back and forth to scrub anything, the suction is poor at best, it's heavy with no hose, and to charge it takes forever just for the privilege of using it for less than 15 minutes!A huge waste of money I'm sad to say."
4,Very nice toddler accessory,"This little cleaner is easy to use, and so far works very well. I got some old juice stains and a cat barf stain out of the carpet right away. The detergent tank is eay to load and the dirty water tank is easy to empty.I only have one minor gripe- I'm not sure it makes sense for this product to be cordless. I was worried at first that its 15 minute runtime with a 12 hour charge would be annoying. It really isn't, it doesn't take but a minute to remove a spot, and you aren't going to use this to clean a whole carpet. However, the manual recommends running the battery completely down before recharging, which means that either it's going to conk out on you when you're using it or that you have to just leave it on to run down when the battery is low. Not a big deal, but is that really more convenient than just using a cord?"
4,Good for small jobs,"I have a large carpet shampooer and was looking for something for small jobs. It does work well, especially for car interior. Great for little spills and stains. I thought the bristles would rotate or move, but they don't. Still works great though. The dirty water container is kind of hard to empty. It's a 2 person job because you have to squeeze the trigger and push the bottom on top. But I still like it. And I would recommend it to others."
1,"worked great until it stopped charging, two days after return window closed!",This item worked great until it stopped charging. I had it less than a month! So very disappointed. I bought it to cope with accidents and spills due my dogs and granddaughter. I emptied the tank after every cleaning so I don't think that is the problem. It will not charge anymore.
1,Lasted a month!,"I understand that you get what you pay for (the price was great on this cleaner) but I certainly expected it to hold up for a bit longer than a month! I don't know if it's the motor or battery, but it just doesn't turn on after being charged anymore. Until then it worked fine for short spurts of cleaning time...but like other reviewers are mentioning it's only good for several minutes before dying. Very disappointed in this product."
3,So so job,"I bought this a couple of years ago and it's impossible to keep it from leaking from the cup where you put the cleaning solution. I've tried everything. If this is a newer model, hopefully it does a better job."
1,Ewwwww -- the smell,"I guess you get what you pay for with this cheap little piece of junk. I think I paid about $40, so it's no great loss to toss it out. The GOOD: the solution that comes with it does a decent job of removing a spot and the suction gets up the liquid pretty good. The BAD: The solution squirter gets in the way when you are trying to dismantle it for cleaning. Not much battery life. The UGLY: It's very difficult to remove the waste tank for cleaning. And if you let it sit for a few hours, you'll regret it mightily -- depending upon what kind of ""spot"" you were cleaning. I can tell you if you are cleaning up after a CAT, get the tank emptied ASAP. That is, if you can get the darn thing off. I finally threw the whole thing in the trash after it sat too long. Not worth dealing with the smell if I was able to get it off."
4,Thanks for taking a return...,"A Christmas present ended up to not be working. Several months had passed before my daughter used her Bissell spot remover. She discovered it did not work. Although it was past the time to return..Amazon was kind enough to make it right and stand behind their merchandise.All that really did is make me want to continue to do business with Amazon. When you are buying things online, it always seems a little risky. I know Amazon will do the right thing and I will continue to do business with them. I thank you again for your consideration in this matter."
4,Quick Fix,This little spotlifter does a great job. Spilled pop and muddy foot prints can be cleaned up in minutes. I would suggest this product for anyone who has kids or animals. Does a superior job of spot cleaning.
4,Good for the money,Works well on stains. The sooner you get to them the better. The instructions tell you to not over saturate the surface you are cleaning and it works better if you don't.
5,Very pleased,"I have an upright steam rug cleaner, however, with three cats and a dog I needed something for ""emergency"" cleaning since my cats are getting a little older. This is perfect for my needs and I am very pleased with how it works"
3,Hand Bissell 1719B SpotLifter,"I have only used this once for cleaning up cat vomit from the carpet. I usually clean my carpets with a Bissell carpet cleaner, which I love, and this one left cleaner spots. I'll try changing the cleaner to the one I use for the larger Bissell and see it it works better. I think it will be nice for getting spots off places the floor cleaner can't go."
3,Lackluster at best,This is good for getting up spots caused by dirt but don't expect to get up many pet stains with this thing. I have an indoor cat that vomits on the rug from time to time. This thing did NOTHING to get that stain out of the rug. Even after multiple passes.
2,Worth the money but that's all,"It does the job, but it's a pain. Unless you use only a tiny amount of cleaner, the suction container fills with suds in a matter of as little as 15 seconds, then suds start to leak out the side vents. (Sometimes it takes more cleaner than that!) Then, cleaning out that container takes a long time. I shattered a thumbnail taking off the container the first time, and it's just not easy to wash out the suds. You have to rinse about 10 times to get it all out. I wish I'd spent more money and gotten a more expensive modelBissell 1200A SpotBot Pet Hands-Free Compact Deep Cleaner, Blue Illusionthat my friend recommended."
4,"Nice, compact and functional","Works really well for my pets little messes. Good suction, could be better, but not bad considering the size. I would recommend to most pet owners."
4,Great for cleaning pet stains out of carpet,"This little cleaner is perfect for cleaning pet stains out of carpet. It vacuums up urine, which works a lot better and quicker than any other method, and the sprayer feature is convenient. I am not a big fan of the included cleaning solution for my purposes, so I am using my own, but you can add any solution you like, or make your own if you choose.I recently acquired a really cool old rug with lots set in stains that have probably been there for years and this does not work to clean it. It requires a steamer. But for newer stains it works great! I love this this little thing. I have 5 pets and I've had it for a few days now and it has made my life much much easier."
4,Great for small stains,"Pros: this machine is perfect for pet stains on carpet; easy to assemble and easy to use, rechargeable and easy to store.Cons: the soap dispenser leaks if not seated properly, and the dirty water chamber comes off with an awkward twist and button push."
3,A great tool with some unfortunate issues,"This one replaced our original spot lifter bought in 2002. The old model was a little smaller and had a little less suction. The new one now is bigger, heavier and has more suction, but it is not better.First, the unit spits sucked up fluid from the motor air vents apparently sucking cleaning solution through the liquid trap in the canister and into the engine. This does not damage anything, but if you clean up house pet messes, you don't want some of that stuff come shooting out of the air vents, right?Further, the canister is difficult to attach and you have to get it angled just right to snap into position. Oterhwise it will not go in.It surprises me that Bissel has gone backwards in functionality of this great tool. The original unit we had was great, functioned great and none of the problems this new unit has. They are also clearly engineering or design flaws that were not present in the older model."
5,Excellent product for spots and spills!,This spotlifter is a great product! It worked so well at removing stains in my car and on my stairs! It was not only easy to use buy required no assembly and I didn't even have to read the directions! This is a great product to have around the house becuase spills happen all the time at my house with kids and pets! I am really glad I bought this product and would recommend it to anyone who is thinking of buying one!
3,Bissell could have learned from previous model.,"This was supposed to be an improvement to Bissell's previous portable carpet cleaner. Yes, this model appears to be more powerful, but it also has several deficiencies. First, the mounting bracket for the previous model does not work. In fact, there is no wall mounting bracket. Second, the brush on the bottom conflicts with getting the nozzle of the suction canister flush to the carpet, thereby limiting the units sucking action. Last, but not least, there is no signal light to indicate whether the unit is being charged or not. The older model had such an indicator. Big omission. Wish I had bought the older model."
4,Would buy again,"The Spotlifter 2X cleans really well, much better than the earlier model. It works especially well on pet stains. The only problem is that it is hard to get apart to clean"
2,Leaker,The basics of the product is good. We had an older model and liked it. This one leaks. Not good.
3,Not the best in this price class.,"Not too long ago we brought home a puppy. It was quickly apparent that we needed a spot remover to bridge the gap between professional carpet cleanings. I ran out an purchased a competing cord model,the Dirt Devil Spot Scrubber SE2800. It worked wonderfully for price class and had great suction power. I came home one day to find the puppy had chewed through the cord in five places. I quickly ran out and bought the Bissell Cordless as a replacement.Bissell's suction power is not as good as the previous Dirt Devil Spot Scrubber SE2800. It is lighter in weight. Filling and removing the water and waste water resevoir is easy. The battery life is farely short.Should I need to purchase a third spot scrubber I would shy away from this model."
3,Ok little machine,"Pros:Suction is great!!Ergo designHandyCons:-Bristle brush is crap. Should redesign & make this part oscillating!-The entire machine sits ON the mess you are trying to clean up. Since you have to push it back & forth to clean/suck up the mess, the whole bottom runs across whatever mess is there. Gross! If you are only cleaning up a tiny, tiny spot, then this won't be an issue.-The detergent storage is INCREDIBLY tiny! Really, I get that this is supposed to be a ""whip out & clean that little mess"" type of deal, but what if it's tomato sauce on the carpet, just to name an example? You may need more detergent to thoroughly clean that up.-Dirty water reservoir is sometimes hard to detach for emptying. I've had to press the detach button a million times for it to actually detach.Overall, it's great for cleaning up dog pee in SMALL amounts, or for doing a quick clean on your stairs. Other than that, my Hoover Steam Clean has everything I need & this thing has now sat in the laundry room!"
2,Shrug.,"Did not work well on my wool braided rug. Don't even know if it cleaned it all at. Perhaps it should only be used on pile carpeting. Disappointing. And, I had to refill it often."
1,Would be great if the chargers worked,"This was such a great vacuum for the first week we had it; then it wouldn't even hold a charge. We called the company and they suggested that it was the charger that was at fault. Sure enough, the charger was cold. They sent a new charger and, about a month later, that one broke too. Now our most recent charger is broken and I need to find some time to get on the phone with Bissell AGAIN to request a new charger. This will be our 4th charger in only a few months.The product is little more than a paperweight if Bissell can't get their act together enough to produce chargers that work. I'll never purchase a vacuum from them again. It's been a nightmare every time our puppy pees on the carpet and we discover that our Bissell is, yet again, dead. The product is unreliable and a constant hassle as a result of this charger issue. I would NEVER recommend anything by Bissell to a friend!"
3,Wish it worked better,"Read the reviews and it works fine, just not as great as people raved. Takes several attempts to get a pet stain out of the carpet even if you follow every single step as instructed. Works, just do not have too high of hopes."
4,Pretty Handy,"I have a lot of kids. They regress to Lord of the Flies pretty fast, and some days it happens without much warning. And just to amp up the chaos we also have 3 dogs...because we are stupid.If we didn't have this thing there would be more stain than original color to my carpet. But this little cleaner does the job -- if you catch the <insert your undesired substance here> fairly quickly.My only complaint about this model is that 2X still doesn't buy you a lot of time at 15 minutes of use. And the charge time is hours. Maybe if I had two of these, one holstered on each hip, western-style, I could keep up with the feral mayhem that is my home.Hopefully you won't need yours as often."
3,"Okay for small jobs, low battery life","This does okay on fresh stains that are small. The spray is very wide and hard to pinpoint to your stain, so you have to clean a much bigger area than needed. It really does only clean for about 15 minutes. It is somewhat difficult to clean all parts of the dirty water holding tank, and it leaks if you tip it the wrong way. All in all, it will clean up fresh stains like cat vomit (the reason I bought it) but only does an okay job on older stains."
3,. The only major flaw is the little button on the handle that must be depressed to empty the reservoir is too difficult for me,This was a replacement for the exact same model that lasted a few years. The only major flaw is the little button on the handle that must be depressed to empty the reservoir is too difficult for me to do. I must have a strong male empty it for me. I don’t have the hand strength to empty it. I was aware of the fault but could not find a better model on line. So it works as I expected.
4,"Works Fine, But...","The Spotlifter arrived within 5 days of ordering and works quite well. We had an earlier model which died (would no longer charge) and was quite happy with it but this newer model is better at cleaning so a definate plus there. However, the nozzel was cracked as received but since we needed it immediately we took a chance and used it as it was. Since there were no leaks of any kind and the damage was only cosmetic we did not bother trying to return it for replacement."
4,it only cost $40...,"pros-easy to fill with solutioneasy to usecordlessvery good for cleaning messes or spills that just happenedvery good for most random spots on carpetcomes with cleanerbrush is removablecons-doesn't pick up tough stainsdifficult to clean water tankwater tank fills up quicklypower doesn't last longcannot replace batteryconsidering the next price point for a cleaner was $90 (for me in store), good buy."
4,perfect for pet owners!,"this little contraption has been excellent to have around, what with the hairballs my cats leave all over the place. the back can sometimes be a bit trickier to get off, but otherwise i like this product a lot overall and would recommend it to anyone looking for a spot cleaner for little messes!"
2,Your own elbow grease is worth more than this unit,"I am not sure how this got such a high rating. It might be worth an average of 3 stars but no way nearly 5. We bought this b/c it said the brush would ""agitate"" the stain. What it didn't say was that the agitation came from your own arm. So what this machine does is spray a stream of liquid that has been mixed with cleaner onto your stain. You then can move the unit over the stain and your own strength with cause the brush on the unit to brush the stain. As you do that it sucks the water back up. So you've spent your money on what you've already been doing-spraying your stains with carpet cleaner and then scrubbing them with a brush and letting it air dry. We bought this because we thought it'd do a better job than what we were already doing. It's actually a worse job and it cost us a lot of money. We'll be returning this unit ASAP."
1,NEver Ever consider this product,The solution doesn't smells good that's the first impression.second is nightmare.Even if you fully charge the cleaner for 24 hours at the first time and fully charge everything before use it.It still last less than 10 minutes. and the solution ran out fast too. ( and the box leaks which holds the solution. )extremely bad designed product. If you don't trust what I say above try one yourself.
1,Bissell spotlifter,"The water spray would not work. Other than that, it is a nifty little machine. I still use it but have to use a spray bottle for the water and soap."
2,Not Satisfied,I bought this for the occasional puppy problem. It gets up the majority of the accident but leaves the carpet still wet. Plus it is just a hassle to have to use the whole machine. If I would have known of the awkwardness I would have spent the extra $40 - $50 and purchased the bigger vacuum. Also this is battery operated and only last about 15 minutes for a 12 hour charge. Not satisfied.
3,A disappointment....,"I have been working on several spots in my carpet with a brand new Spotlifter--and am so disappointed in the performance. The machine sprays solution onto the carpet, and then the little scrubber (not unlike a fingernail brush) is supposed to clean the rug when dragged back and forth. This machine simply does not measure up to the little Green Machine (which I loaned to my daughter and never got back!). The suction is not strong, so you must go back and forth several times! I'd return it if I could!"
5,Great for Pets,This thing is awesome for people who have pets that make minor stains here or there. One time my dog had diarrhea even and this thing got all of it out. I would not know how to deal with these messes without this thing.
4,"Pets, nothing beats this little cleaner!","I have 2 dogs and more cats then I care to mention... vomit, other spills, etc...it WILL get the stains out! On dried vomit or dried spills it does take a few pushes back and forth, make sure you utilize the brush attached to it. I have used all kinds of steam cleaning products so its not limited tojust the bissel products. This pretty much takes care of anything that's wet or dry that hits the carpet...I personally could not live without it!"
4,Love this,"I just used this carpet cleaner for the first time on old carpet stains, and it worked FANTASTICALLY! I wish the battery life were a little longer, but it is so easy to use and very effective! I am a big fan."
2,Not very good,The dogs had an accident today so I pulled out my new Spot Lifter to tackle a few spots of the ole number 2 on my BRAND NEW Carpet. I used the 8 ounce Bissell cleaning fluid that came with the spot lifter. The spray mechanism worked well and I saturated the dodo spots and scrubbed away with the scrub brush.It worked OK from a cleaning standpoint still leaving a trace of poo but my major problem is the almost complete lack of any suction. I admit I over sprayed and used about 1/3 of the bottle of spray during this small but stinky cleanup. I noticed that maybe an ounce of nasty fluid was sucked back off of my carpet and into the machine. Basically no suction. The rest of the cleaning fluid is still on my new carpet.I'll have to do a bit of manual work here.Avoid this one people.
1,Run Away Fast and Save Yourself $40+,"I purchased this item yesterday and wasted my money. I'm writing this so you won't have to. First, it seems like it was a good idea for me since I have limited space. I charged the battery per the directions and used it on a stain...it was ok, but I knew I've have to do a 2nd cleaning. Then, all heck broke loose! You have to remove the front collector each time you use the machine, empty and replace it. Easier said than done - and not as easy as the directions imply. I've tried multiple times now (20+ since my purchase yesterday) to replace the front collector - IT IS IMPOSSIBLE! Every time I think I have it ""snapped into place"" I turn the machine on and it spurts out cleaning fluid from the side. Needless to say, I have had several ""little green"" cleaning fluid showers in the past 24 hours! I'd say if you have the space to look at a larger model because I can't believe there would be the same issues...take it from someone who just lost $45 and skip this one."
2,"Great spray, terrible suction","I purchased the predecessor to this machine and then let it sit in the box for a couple of years. What a mistake. I don't know if it's age (do NiCad batteries go bad on the shelf?) or design flaw, but it runs only about five minutes on a charge. The electric spray is great -- even distribution of the cleaning solution with very little effort -- but I only got about a tablespoon of it back in the hopper before the battery died. I have a boy cat who was neutered too late and I think I'm going to need something a bit more heavy duty for when the neighbor cats come over and make him nervous enough to start marking his INDOOR territory again."
4,Great for small clean-ups,"I have a sick cat who vomits on occasion. This Bissell cleaner is perfect for cleaning up the mess. It's small, easy to use, and easy to clean. The only downfall is the relatively short battery life. I wish it had an option to run it off a cord if needed. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't trade this in for a corded version. The ability to quickly grab the cleaner and clean up a spill on the stairs, or a couch is great. Overall, a good purchase."
4,SpotLifter,"Good product! Came with somewhat poor instructions, but you get the idea on how to use it. I really like that you can leave solution in it and just have it ready for the next accident - takes a lot of the work out."
5,Haven't been sorry yet...,My husband and I purchased this product after a friend recommended it for our puppy messes. This product has paid for itself more than once. One day we painted the house and a full paint pot was dropped on the carpet. We used the spot lifter and all the paint came out. The same weekend the dog got sick on the carpet after eating a treat too fast. It was the kind that stains anything it touches. Again everything came out wonderful. I can't begin to tell you how many times we have not been sorry we made this purchase. Rinse the dirty water container after each use and you won't be sorry you bought one.
4,spot remover,with a grandchild in the house i knew i would get alot of use out of this product .And it works great she spilt red fruit punch on light colored carpet and it came out with ease.
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I have a large Bissell floor cleaner that I think is a worthless piece of garbage, so I was very reluctant to buy another Bissell product. However, the reviews for this one were decent, it was the right size and the right price for what I was looking for. I have to say, this works great for small spots. The only complaint I have is that the water compartment doesn't seal to the rest of the machine properly (popped off as soon as I took the packaging tape off of it), which can cause the sprayer to stop working. It is easy to push it down and the sprayer will start to work again right away, and it isn't that big of a hassle since this thing is so small. BUT, it would be nice if it would just work properly. Still leaps and bounds better than my large Bissell!"
5,Awesome,This product works great it's exactly what I thought it was!!! I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to clean up the little messes in life!
4,Good for the price,"This is cheaper and lighter than a lot of other cleaners. It is the only one I can easily carry up the stairs. works great as a spot cleaner, does a decent job cleaning the stairs. Only con is that it takes hours to charge and only works for a few minutes."
4,"Does the job, but a few things that bother me","Runs on its own battery and comes with a charger. On the instructions, it says fully charged it will only stay on for 7 MINUTES. Yup, you read that right. So I am constantly charging it. After you use it, it gives off a funny odor. Other than those two things, it does the job and I can't imagine myself without it because I have a 10 week old puppy."
1,Really useless product,"It takes about 12 hours to 'fully charge' the thing and then after it's fully charged, it works for about 10 minutes. The product itself is just incredibly useless. It's literally a mini-portable vacuum cleaner with a windex-like spray attached to it. Why wouldn't I just get a vacuum cleaner that does a better job of cleaning and get a spray bottle? It would work better and it'd be cheaper.I don't know who wrote all the good reviews for this product, because they seriously confuse me. This thing is just incredibly useless all around. If you want to charge something for 12 hours to have it function for about 10 minutes, go ahead and buy this thing.tl;dr - it's useless and way too expensive for how useless it is. Don't buy it."
2,Great at first. . . Battery gave up,"I originally thought this was a great deal! I wanted something small and portable for ""little"" messes so I didn't always have to break out the full size steam cleaner.This worked exceedingly well for the first month, but then it wouldn't re-charge anymore. I followed the instructions for the ""battery charge resistance"" in the manual repeatedly for a full week (exhausting the battery, then charging it, repeat). Complete waste of time! It still barely charges (to a dull groan that lasts 5 seconds).After waiting over 10 minutes on Bissell's customer service line and still not getting a live person, I gave up. Sad, because if it would just charge, it'd be fine."
2,No more than me with the Bissell cleaning solution and a brush,"I thought it would act more like a stanley steemer or something. Perhaps I didn't read the specs very well. Was expecting the machine to do much more work. I ended up using my cleaning tools (brushes, rags, etc.) along with the Bissell cleaning solutions and it did the same thing. Will be returning this item."
2,A disappointing product,"I think I should have ordered the one with rotating brushes to get the cleaning power I really wanted. It did hold a charge well, and was good on itty bitty spills. My husband knocked it off the shelf and it fell about 3 feet to the floor, where the suction mouth shattered to pieces. It should be constructed of better plastic....cause that is the end of the useful life of this little dud."
1,Stop before you buy!,"My experience with Bissell's spot cleaners has been horrible. The model I bought six months ago just went out to the trash after months of ""bickering with Bickell."" I think it worked three times and Bickell's customer service people managed to talk me out of returning it until the return date had passed. I decided to check and see if there are similar products made by other carpet cleaning companies. Bissell is the only company that makes these, which makes me wonder why Eureka, Hoover, and other good companies don't have something even close to offer in the spot cleaning robot machine category. I have to think the technology has not been perfected enough for reputable companies to take a chance on it. I have a Dyson carpet cleaner I love, but was expensive. I wanted something simple to take care of spills. But don't waste your money on Bissell."
3,Getting Pet Stains out of Carpet,The SpotLifter is handy and I like it except for one design detail. My hands are too small to grip the dirty water tank and remove it for emptying and cleaning. I have to ask someone else to do it.The Rose Killer
3,Good Machine while it lasted,"I loved this machine until the motor burned out. I used it to clean pet stains in between shampooing the entire carpet. It had good suction and did a great job cleaning the spots. It was light to hold and very convenient. It held it charge for long periods of time too. The only problems were that if it accidentally turned over on its side, the dirty water would leak out on my newly cleaned carpet and it was kind of hard to take the top off to clean out the dirty water. I was really disappointed that after only two months of owning it, the motor burned out! It gave no notice that it was going to break, it just stopped working. I have a big Bissell Steam Machine that I think is great so I think it's a good brand generally. Maybe it's a fluke thing to have the motor burn out but I was pretty disappointed."
2,Poor performance,I was disappointed with this machine. It doesnt pick the soap back up adequately so you end up with more of a mess than when you started.
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"This thing isn't powerful enough to suck the water up. I used two tanks of water and I had a drizzle of water that actually came back up. I have short carpet too, which usually you can pull a ton of water out of. You can see the water trying to vaccum up, but it never pulls it hard enough to make it to the top and stay in the reserve. The only reason I think anyone feels like their carpet is getting cleaner is because you spray their cleaning solution on it and scrub it with a brush. I shouldn't have paid $[...] dollars for something a some carpet cleaner, scrub brush, and towel could have done just as well!!!!"
5,Brissell spotlifter 2X Portable Cleaner Carpet Cleaner,I have 2 new puppy's in my houseI think this is Cleaner is Wonderful.Pick's up the little puppy piddlesit's working. My carpet is saved!I love this handy cleaner. I even usedit on my bed when a puppy made an oops.
1,I could suck more water up with a straw,"I must have gotten a bad product, because this just flat out doesn't work. Even fully charged, the battery only lasts for about 15-20 seconds before it rapidly dies, and in that 15 seconds it will only suck up 1/2 an ounce of water. I bought it a while ago and can't find any of the paperwork so I'm probably screwed for returning it - what a waste of $40. :c("
1,FIRE HAZARD!,"This thing would have burned my house down this morning if I hadn't smelled the smoke. I had left it connected to the charger, but when I tried to use it the motor didn't work. I left it plugged in, and turned the power switch on to see if it was receiving power (the motor would have turned, very slowly. Nothing happened to I turned my attention to something else and within a minute smelled smoke. I finally identified the sorce; it was this product cooking itself, and becoming very hot. I unplugged it and threw it away. If I had left the room it would have melted and undoubetly started a fire. Not buying a replacement. Stay away from this thing."
1,Bissell 1719B SpotLifter 2X Portable Deep Cleaner Carpet Cleaner,"I think this product is a huge waste of money. I plan to send it back. I bought it to clean up cat regurgitation. After reading the directions I tried it on a spot and spent about 10 minutes running it back and forth in the manner recommended in the directions. It had no effect whatsoever on the spot, which was fresh. I then cleaned up the spot with a cloth and some Resolve spray.If you need something that actually works don't buy this product."
3,Great Machine but Battery Only is TERRIBLE!,"My family has used Bissels for years, so I was all excited to get mine when I had my first baby. This is the one I got.Waste of money . . .It works well when fully charged, but the batteries don't stay charged for five minutes! Seriously! I was five minutes into my last cleaning project (baby barf) when the batteries died! It was freshly charged! The smell is still in the carpet, and so is the cleaner and water! The battery option is handy for inside vehicles or things like that, but the unit won't run when it's plugged in and charging. The battery doesn't last as long as it used to, either.Don't bother with the cleaner. It doesn't even touch teh smell of baby barf. Oxy clean in a spray bottle works better. Then just put water in the bissel for rinsing.I'm very disappointed . . ."
2,spotlifter,The performance was very good but I had to return it because I had a hard time taking the dirty watercase off I had to have the man upstairs take it off. I would not recommend it.
5,Fabulous for pet stains!,"I actually found this little gem in a thrift store. My 9-year Yorkie has some ""digestive"" issues, and I give this little wonder a 10+ rating for cleaning up little stains. I would gladly have paid full price to get this kind of results!"
4,Good cleaner for pet messes,"I bought this unit to help me clean up after two aging cats who sometimes make messes in my apartment. Today was my first opportunity to use it, and I'm pleased with the result.Pros: Self contained, cordless, good suctionCons: Difficult to empty the waste water containerI chose this item because I didn't think I had the storage space for a full size steam cleaner. I thought this would be more useful since I could also use it on the upholstery and carpets in my car. So far, I'm pleased with it. It would have gotten a 5 star rating if it wasn't so difficult to get the front canister off to empty the waste water. I hope Bissell will remedy that."
5,great for pet messes,"The Spotlifter is light and easy to grab in a hurry. Instead of putting off getting out my old heavier plug-in type, I clean up pet messes when I find them in a few seconds."
1,beltronics V940 Vector Detector,Took the radar detector out of the box & tried to put it into the car. The cups would not hold the detector in place. The cups kept falling off the detector. No use if it won't hold together.
5,Good Buy!,"I bought this back in March and have been very please with it. The first road test I pulled out of my house and instantly picked up a cop driving right in past me. I typically don't speed through city streets but Dallas Constables have become rather aggressive in issuing tickets over the past 9 months. If you live in the Dallas area you'll know what I mean.I get the random laser false alarms, at least I am assuming they are false alarms since I never see any cops around. They can't hide that good. Couple of x-band false alarms but that is typicle with any detector I have used.It was a toss up between this one and the 850 but I went with this one even though it was a little more $$ than the 850. Overall I am very please with this product."
5,Works great,"I love my V940 and the picture is correct. It is what I got and the perfomance is great. I have had mine for a few weeks and it is amazingly accurate. It is also very easy to program in the case that you want to. The best thing is that once it starts beeping it sound automaticly gets quite after a few secounds, which is great because other modles killed my ears."
3,Jury is still out,Overall the unit works OK. There are too many false alerts though. I have a had a few instances when the laser indicator has occurred without ever finding a source.
5,Beltronics V940 Rocks!,"Found this on Amazon for a really good price. I have loved using this radar detector. It is accurate, has a lot of cool features, and compares to my Escort Passport quite well in performance, all for a few bones less!"
3,Great Detector...but questionable duarability,"I purchased my 940 bell about two years ago to replace my cheap ($40 wally world special) cobra. The range is good, I have a 1,200 mile round trip drive to get home and the 940 unit has not let me down yet. I have driven over 17,000 miles with this radar and I have yet to receive a ticket! This radar does have a high volume of false alarms but I don't mind that. My only complaint is that within the first month of buying it I had to take it back to the store and have it replaced (free of charge). Take note that I know how to handle a radar detector and I even take it out of my truck on extremely hot/cold days. There was no good reason for it to die and my truck is only a few years old with no electrical problems. But, this said the new 940 unit is still up and running so maybe it was just an isolated incident."
5,BEST PERFORMANCE & BEST VALUE ON THE MARKET!,"This is the 5th V940 I have bought for myself & family since 2009. These are the BEST value & performers you can buy. I have owned Valentines, Passports & the top-of-the-line Beltronics & none provide as much straightforward performance or value as these V940's! TRULY A STEAL AT THIS PRICE."
5,find the smokey,i'm so glad i bought this detector. it really has saved me from getting speeding tickets. it alerts you in plenty of time to monitor your speed so you don't get a ticket from those pesky state troopers or those a$$ hole small town speed trap cops that are just waiting to rob you as you drive through their crappy one horse town. i do a lot of highway driving and i would recommend this detector. you can't beat the features for the price. it works for me.
1,Pretty Disappointing,"On the plus side: you can preset the device to skip the start-up run through all the signals.On the minus side: warning sounds are harsh and raspy, worst I have ever heard. After a couple months (and having thrown away the box for returning it) it keeps going into tilt and displaying Service Required. I never feel confident that it is working.I have owned several radar detectors, many costing less, that worked reliably. This one must be a lemon."
3,"Good, but not awesome","I purchased this detector because my previous one was not picking up laser signals anymore. This detector seems cheaper and has more false alarms than my old cobra model( which was much less expensive). While this detector does pick up laser radar, it does not pick up KA or K bands as quickly as the cobra model did.Pros: Laser detectionVoice alertsCons: Annoying tonesMore false alarmsMore expensive.I would probably purchase another Cobra detector in the future and avoid this Beltronics model."
2,Didn't Seem to Work,Hooked it up but it really didn't seem to be doing anything. I didn't like that you have to have this cord hooked up to it all the time.
4,Loud!,This is a basically good product - it performs well in all respects - however - even on it's lowest volume setting it is a little loud for me - it should notify you - not distract and irritate you.
4,Beltronics V940,"It is a good radar detector. I used on a trip to Colorado. The unit picked up radars a half mile away in some instances, and paid for itself several times over on this single trip. The only flaw I have found with the unit is the windshield attachment. The detector simply slides onto the windshield attachment. Not sure if its the angle of the windshield in my F250, but the thing just slides off the attachment at times. My simple fix was just putting a rubber band around the whole thing to keep it on."
5,My husband loves his!,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. It is solid, easy to use, picks up very well--we are glad we bought it."
3,too loud,"Works good, but you have to adjust the volume down everytime you turn it off and on. I suppose it's loud for vehicles that are noisy."
3,false laser alerts with v940,"I ordered this detector because of it's price tag and the reviews. When I recieved my unit the sound didn't work but the beltronics customer service was great and gave me a new unit, two extra windshield mounts and an extra power cord. What really bothers me about this unit is that whenever driving into the sun (which happens everyday when I am going to work and when I leave work) the detector will light up and scream laser. I was going to give it a one or two star review because of this annoying defect but then it saved me from a ticket while comming over a hill on the interstate. I love this detector because it is simple and it works well, but the laser makes you jump and slam on your brakes when your just driving west in the late afternoon. If I had to go back and do it again I would purchase a more expensive unit or just not get one at all. It seems that most of the police cars I pass are using lidar anyways."
4,police,had a bitt of trouble with the first one but they were quick to exchange it it is still hard to tell how accurate it is and how far away it lets you know when your being tracked it seams like a good unit and i would recarmend it
3,Beltronics V940,This is my third Beltronics detector and the quality is very good but I most likely will not buy another one. The reason is that they have removed all the accessories and now make you buy everything extra. I have never used the windshield mount or lighter plug so the visor clip and the hard wire in cable cost another $25. I just as well have bought something for more money and got the extra items included. I am very disappointed in Beltronics for CHEAPing up their items by removing what should be standard items.
5,Great Product,"My Beltronic V940 is music to my ears. Every time I hear the ""churp"" I know it's doing its job and more. The ""smokies"" are now coming out of the bushes and not the emergency route on the xpresswy. This unit picks them up every time. If you do a lot of traveling, you need to consider a Beltronics Radar/laser detector. I will never be without mine."
4,"Great Radar Detector, not too sure about the cord & windshield holder","I bought this based upon other's reviws and I hae to agree that this radar detector works great for the prine range. The cord and windshield mount were extremely fustrating when I first tried to use the radar detector. It kept falling off of the mount and down onto the floor while I was driving. This basically makes the radar detector useless when it's on the car floor. I had to wrap a rubber band around the radar detector and mount to keep it in place. For this price range, I'd expect a mount that works and is fully functional. The cord was initially too tight which increased the issues with the radar detector falling off the mount. The cord eventually loosned up and is less of a fustration now.Great radar detection, poor mounting equipment"
4,Review from NZ,"I purchased this detector for use in New Zealand (all detectors over here are very expensive!). I found the unit to be good for standard radar (in police cars, etc), but marginal for speed camera vans - approx 200m. Also, you cannot disable individual radar 'bands' - the police don't use X Band in NZ (which can get annoying). A reasonable result for the price"
5,Picks up Everything!!!,"Bought this for a 6 week trip across the U.S. and Canada. It picked up radar with plenty of time to slow down at least 95% of the time. Certainly saved me from a few tickets. Highly recommend the unit. Its light, durable, and holds to the windshield well. Plus it comes with an extra pair of suction cups in case the originals ever fail. You can easily adjust the volume and its screen is very easy to read both during the day and night. Very nice radar detector."
5,"Bridges: Amazing Structures to Design, Build & Test","Fantastic Book! Educational & Lots of Fun! My son built one of the bridges out of household items and ""plays"" with it constantly. It is obvious that a lot of time, research and thought went into this book. Keeps children of all ages interested."
5,Bridges met expectations,"I had never taught about bridges, and this book met my expectations. It has games, and information that the kids really understood. I would recommend this book to 2nd grade teachers teaching common core curriculum."
5,Good for youth weights...,"We used these ""Mediums"" on my sons board he likes them. I bought ""Hards"" for my (180+ Lbs. adult) board and they improved handling LOTS."
4,Very informative,"This book breaks down hundreds of drugs so that you understand what they are, how they are used, what dosages, etc. Most every drug you can think of is in here. Each medication has at least one full page dedicated to it. The only drawback I have seen is that some of the drugs have secondary effects, and have been used specifically for those effects, but that is completely overlooked. All in all, if you want to delve deeper into what you are giving your animals, or want to know more about what you should be giving your animals, this is the book for you. I also highly reccomend the Merck Veterinary handbook as these two work very well together."
3,"very clear, and concise, but...","This book does not appear to contain any PHOTOS of medications, the same way human meds books will do... I won't likely need it until 3 months from now, so I will hold onto it for now, but don't be surprised if you see it up for sale again on my inventory list..."
2,What did you expect.,"For someone who spent her last years alone,a prisoner,jailed by a vanity so huge,it engulfed her,i didnt expect her to reveal much in this,and she dosent,she tells lie after lie,and contradicts herself time and again,all she gives us is what is left of the astute mind,that lay behind the actress,and you know what,we actually dont want to know, why, becauce everyone knows that fame is as phoney as a seven dollar bill,but now and again there comes along someone who transends this,hypnotising everyone into a trance.It was written that she wrote this only for the money becauce she was broke,unforgivible in another,but not marlene,for a soldiers daughter has to survive somehow,whose to argue maybe she will need all her energy to fight another war,such is the legend of marlene."
1,Disappointment,"This DVD is a lot less about Sarah, than somethinng else thatI woudn't buy. It has only five songs by Sarah, and skits with Lena Horn, Bessie Smith and acouple of others. Most of the disc consists of nine World War II songs by the International Ssweethearts of Rhythem. Who?The audio and video are very poor, some in black & white, some in old color.This product makes me leery about ordering on line if I can't hear or preview it first.Eldon Bryant"
3,"All it takes is time, money and labor--and inspiration","Here's what happens when you take a typical post-WWII American suburban home, add some design ingenuity, a lot of labor and a ton of money: you get a unique, livable and classy home. At least that's what's shown in this book--though I wish some of the homes had more photos and detailed floor plans."
2,Take plain houses and make them ugly,"With a few exceptions, the houses in this book were made into ghastly Modernist homes, or were so overdone as to not be viable to any but the rich. I do not recommend this book."
2,Lightweight and narrow,This book preaches about how to make a clone of an action game without really explaining the principles behind why a good game is good or the art of computer game design.I found that it often contradicted Game Design Theory & Practice by Richard Rouse which is a much better book as it explains the principles of design with support from many experts rather than just saying that all games should be done a certain way.Bates' book is quick and easy to read but not inspiring or thought provoking. Most of it was just common sense.
3,Good for older women,"I found several patterns in this that I like and that's why I bought it, but for the most part I won't make half the jackets in here. It is, however, well written."
3,Bizarre and fascinating.,"Uhm. Hmm. This is a strange album. It incorporates bizarre sound effects, jazz-ish sounding motifs, breakbeats, and atonal and polytonal 'structures' (ahem...). It is interesting and ocassionally quite good ('My Sound' is about the only thing close to an actual 'song' in the traditional-heck, even in the acid-jazz/ambient world). Worth a try if not really satisfying. Good music for background or maybe a halloween party."
2,"It's all right, but","Again, since I had heard some Squarepusher I enjoyed on the local high school radio station some time ago, I moved past my disappointment with ""Feed Me Weird Things"" and purchased ""Music Is One Rotted Note"". The songs are well-put together and this music is all right, but personally it just doesn't do anything for me. The only way I can describe it is that this side of Squarepusher sounds too loaded up with urban pretensions without any higher purpose to balance the effort. Just not for me."
2,Mister Jenkinson releases his homage to Miles.,"This is certainly not innovative. Jenkinson's work from Spymania days is far more creative than this piece. Better to pick up the newly re-mastered (and re-mixed) Miles. Bill Laswell does an excellent job bringing in the low-end on Panthalassa--the ""reconstruction and mix translation"" of Miles Davis '69-'74.But, Squarepusher cannot be faulted for re-inventing himself. Unfortunately, this just seems out of place in his progression."
5,un vistazo a la vida en provincia del siglo pasado,"Esta comedia es genial, totalmente recomendable para pasar un buen rato de diversión, además te permite ver como era la vida en la provincia mexicana a mediados del siglo pasado, a mi gusto una de las mejores películas de Tin-Tan."
5,Review by Sean,"This is the best sci fi series since foundation by Asamov, it expands and enhances the anime series far beyond anything I have ever encounted today. This is a once in a life time adventurenthat I have repeatedly enjoyed for over twenty years and will enjoy for the rest of my life."
1,Unreadable slop,"Inane, boring, stupid, not even good for a paper towel. Don't waste your money or time. I'm sorry I wasted my time with any part of this book."
4,The saga continues...,"Join Rick Hunter and the rest of mankind as they try to save Earth. The war seems to be coming to a close, but Earth itself is still a battlefield, as both humans and aliens try to find their place within a world almost destroyed by years of conflict. Will Rick tell Lisa he loves her? Will there ever be peace? Will the Robotech Masters come to Earth themselves? READ IT!"
1,like tissue paper,it started ripping all over when i first wore it....biggest let down ever...the lining and the bottom of the entire shirt just tore and tore....
1,False advertising!,"[...] is using false advertising to get you to their web site. I ordered this unit with a DIESEL return line only to receive a unit for a GAS tank. They promised to send the correct replacement when I sent back the original unit, only to find that they had sent another different unit for a GAS tank, even though I had given them the correct part number and description from Moeller. I am now 2.5 months from my order date and was told that they no longer have the part available from their supplier. I am still waiting for my refund. I would NEVER do business with this [...] again."
5,worked great,"the installation was fast and worked great for a 12"" gas tank. the instruction was great and simple. did not have to adjust any."
5,Works perfectly,The unit simply works. It was an exact fit replacement in my old 1980 Glasstron boat. Now I know how much gas I have.
4,Good product,The fuel sender comes with a new gasket and machine screws. Make sure you buy from Amazon. I bought one from an outside vendor and they sent me a primer bulb instead.
4,nothing like dangerfield's humor,"This man takes pain and tragedy and turns it into artistic humor. Dangerfield's personality resonates throughout this book, and while you are laughing, you are reading his autobiography.Hilarious."
4,It's Not Easy Bein' Me,"I purchased this book for my husband. He really enjoyed it and said that he was truly surprised by at its honesty. It's always a surprise to find out about the serious difficulties that a ""Happy go lucky guy"" encounters in his lifetime and how unhappy he really was, all the while, making others laugh."
4,"Lighter than expected, but fun nevertheless!",Picked this up by chance -thought my husband would like it- and I read the whole thing in a couple days. I thought it would be a little more in depth about Rodneys life but I suppose he shared what he wanted to and it was a good quick read-complete with some hilarious laugh out loud jokes. Not knowing much about him or how tough it is to be a comedian this book filled me in.
3,A review? You kiddin' me?,"Hey, does he look like Horace Walpole? He dictated his life story into a tape recorder, a ghost writer typed it up, and here it is! It's the stereotypical comedian's story: bad childhood, hard knocks, pursuing dissipation in clubs and bars, then stardom strikes. Along the way he introduces friends and recounts adventures, and passes along some advice for comics. And that's all, really; and it's plenty.Hey, whaddaya want? Do I look like Jonathan Yardley? Just get the book already!"
3,"Kind of sad, really","We all know Rodney as a king of one-liners. But this book is nothing more than a depressing account of a terrible life. Even when it goes into some of the more interesting accounts -- e.g. experiences with Jim Carrey; why he wishes he was Howard Stern -- they end in 2-3 paragraphs. There is no depth in the stories, and they aren't all that funny. I got this out of the library, so it was worth it. But save your money...this isn't worth the price until it goes into paperback. (Sorry Rodney)"
2,Dissapointed,"I disagree with the previous reviews. This book was a quickly written tome of banal anecdotes. Important area's of Rodney's life were only touched upon in an extremely cursory way. For example, his run in with the IRS was touched on, but no details were provided. Ditto- his divorce,his relationship with his children etc.Some of his battles with other comedians were not even mentioned. There was just nothing to sink my teeth into.No angst, no pathos, no emotion- just trivial unimportant stories of only passing interest.Recently on Howard Stern's radio program, Howard asked Rodney why at the age of 80, he decided to write this book. Rodney's answer- ""a big advance."" That says it all.If anyone would like to read a truly great autobiography of a comedian, may I suggest ""Jackie Oy"" by Jackie Mason. I truly know the ""inner Jackie.""I still don't know Rodney- too bad."
2,"Okay, but light","Rodney wrote his autobiography like he wrote his jokes - short, simple sentences. While this works great for comedy it doesn't work so well for his life story.Don't get me wrong, I love the man, and his story is especially heartbreaking during his early years -- his jokes about not being loved as a child are all too firmly based in reality -- but he omits little details like his marriage to his last wife, only mentioning his married life near the end of the book. It's a good and inspiring story, but in this case Rodney would have been helped by a ghostwriter."
4,good and funny read,I knew cora Dodd and she was a very private and proper lady. This book tells the funny side of a rather serious business. all the time maintaining the privacy of the people involved. If you are from Paris Crossing Indiana or the surrounding area you will love the history of the area that she paints in her stories . If you are not from the area you will love the memories of a small town and how the people took care of each other. worth the time it takes to read and the money you spend.
3,Debra Snipes classic gospel sound,"This was a great purchase for me. I like the classic gospel sound and that is was Debra Snipes delivers. While some of the tracks seemed to use the same melodies with different lyrics, you'll be able to get into this. I purchased because I was looking for one specific song ""The Rock"" If you heard it and liked it, this CD will be worth it. If not, listen to the samples first."
1,terrible...tons of static,This monitor is the worst on the market. Don't waste your money-spend a little extra and get the sony baby call. My husband and I couldn't hardly sleep due to the loud static. I got better sleep on the floor in my sons room!
1,"Horrible monitor, disappointed mom in Texas","Stop, read this before you buy!! The interference on this monitor makes it unuseable. I had to purchase a new one, so my advice is to spend the extra dollars up front and save yourself the headache. It is appropriately named...lots of SOUND!"
3,Just OK,"We tried this monitor briefly before moving on, and our biggest issue was the sound quality: it was not very loud, there was a constant background static humming with a louder sound every 1 second. The lights and two-way transmission are good, but we've found we don't really need them. We moved on to a F.P. 900 MHz vibrating monitor and are ecstatic -- much better sound quality, minimal background noise."
1,TOO MUCH STATIC,"This monitor is horrible, I hear the static more than I hear the baby. I do not recommed this monitor-I have to buy a new one."
3,Good monitor for the price,"The FP Sound 'n Lights monitor is a very good choice for the price. We originally bought the FP 900 mhz monitor, but ended up returning it for this one. We had a lot of interference with the 900 mhz monitor. I still have some trouble with this monitor, but overall it works very well. It is very sensitive. I can hear my son's tiny little snores quite clearly. It doesn't have a very good range, but for use in the house does the job. If you are looking for a moderately priced monitor to use in the house, this one is a very good choice."
2,"Invest in a better monitor, you'll be glad you did.","This monitor has WAY too much static and makes a ticking noise constantly. When being operated in battery mode, you have to replace the batteries after about 8 hours of use, or every other day. What a HASSLE!! We are going to go buy a better monitor ASAP in hopes of getting some sleep without having to tolerate the constant ""tick, tick, tick..."""
1,too much static,I found this monitor useless. The static was so loud on one channel that I couldn't sleep. The other channel picks up a radio station clear as day but not my baby crying. It is going right back to the store!
3,Not too pleased,While the monitor is very sensitive (we can often hear our son breath) I have also had the problem where the sound cuts out at a loud or high pitched sound such as crying.
1,Really poor quality,"picks up the signals from the other monitor transmitter, even when it's set to operate on the different channel. On top of it the monitor doesn't pick up the quite sounds.I regret buying it and now looking to buy one in the Radioshack."
1,Really poor quality,"picks up the signals from the other monitor transmitter, even when it's set to operate on the different channel. On top of it the monitor doesn't pick up quite sounds.I regret buying it and now looking to buy one in the Radioshack."
2,Too much static to be useful,"This monitor worked great for the first week. Then, there was so much static I couldn't sleep, and I couldn't hear the baby clearly. I highly recommend the Sony babycall monitor (also carried by Babies R Us, but not online). It has a wonderful voice activated only feature that allows perfect silence from the monitor unless baby is fussing (i.e., you won't hear the vacuum cleaner or the dryer or the neighbor's dog barking, etc. - it only turns on when the baby cries or your spouse talks, etc.) I bought the Sony and retired the Fisher Price and am sleeping better than I have in weeks."
1,Get used to listening to Static!,"We also bought this monitor because of the glowing reviews. We have been using it for 7 months and are tolerating it, but definitely would not rate it as a great product. The static is terrible (plus a high-pitched buzz). We are sometimes able to move it to different areas in our room to reduce the static but that never lasts for long. If it's remotely close to any other electronic device there's no chance of it being quiet. Fortunately we've never had trouble hearing our son cry over the static, but it is getting very annoying falling asleep to the sound of static every night."
1,Not a clear monitor,"We received this monitor as a shower gift. When we tested it before our daughter was born it worked fine. Since then, another family in our neighborhood has begun using this monitor. On one channel we hear their nursery and the other loud static. Between all the cell phones and cordless phones in the area we cant get clear reception. We are returning this to the store and buying another one."
1,Don't waste your money on this one,"We broke our last monitor, went looking for the least expensive one and ended up with this. The sound quality is awful. The base unit sits over my son's bed, but it still sounds like he's in a tunnel. Second, it does not have rechargeable batteries and eats up 9 volt batteries like nobody's business. This one's cheap (until you add the cost of batteries), and you'll certainly get what you pay for! My advice: Spend a little more and make sure it uses rechargeable batteries."
3,Not new and improved!,"We bought the Sounds & Lights monitor 2 yrs. ago and have been so pleased with it. We bought another set recently for our upcoming 2nd baby, and did not find that the quality has been new and improved as they claim. The units felt so lightweight and not sturdy compared to our old set. While it seemed to work fine during the day, it had a loud buzz at night when I plugged it in beside my bed, even at the very lowest volume setting. Also, the old set could take batteries in the transmitter as well as the receiver - we found this handy as we clipped the transmitter to the bassinet so it was right with the baby when we wheeled him from room to room around the house. I returned this one and found one that we liked better by Evenflo Constant Care 1500. It also takes batteries in both the transmitter & receiver and is very quiet, even with the volume turned up all the way."
4,New mommy,I have this monitor for my 12week old baby and I have had no problems at all. I guess the only way you get tons of static is if you have the volume all the way up which since this monitor picks up everything I don't think that is necessary. But overall the monitor gets an A!
2,Dissappointed in Fisher Price,Go ahead and buy a better monior from the start. We recieved this monitor as a shower gift. We have a split floor plan so he slept in our room and we didn't atempt to use monitor till he was 10 weeks old. When we did we could not sleep because of the humming and static. We had keep our son sleeping in our room untill we bought the Sony babycall. Now we can sleep. The Sony has a voice actived feature so at night the monior is quiet untill the baby cries. You can also listen if you want. The sony is quieter with less stactic. Don't waste your money on the Fisher Price.
2,"Very, very noisy",The only thing I liked about this monitor is that it lit up. It was entirely too noisy. I almost couldn't hear my baby for the noise that the monitor made. Needless to say it only lasted one night in my house. I found the Safety First model to be alot better.
3,lotsa noise and eats batteries,"The noise, the same sound like made by an AM radio when the dial is between stations, is loud and consistent, even when plugged into my Tripp-Lite noise filter and my electrical stuff is off.Seems the noise level isn't any different switching between AC adaptor and the battery.In reply to the complaint about eating batteries. The new rechargeables called NiMH for (Nickel Metal Hydride) are much better than the type they replaced in the market called NiCad. If you need long lasting rechargeables, go get some. NiMH rechargeables are great if you use batteries (I think they last long as alkalines)."
2,"Works great, when it works!","After reading the great reviews about this monitor my husband and I desided to get it. After our baby was born we put it to the test. It worked great, I could hear every little sound that our daughter made. About twenty minutes later all you could hear was loud static. We tried everything to fix it. We changed batteries, tried diffrent channels, and even bought a new adapter for it. Nothing worked. We returned it and bought a Graco Clear Range Monitor. It works fantastic. We've never had one single problem with it, and my daugter loves to knock it around a bit."
1,Don't Buy This Monitor!,"I researched monitors, and found that this one had pretty good reviews. When we started using it with our newborn, the batteries would only last 4 nights! We switched brands of batteries, but the same thing again. You can count on spending $5-6 a week just on batteries. Now, after using it for 3 weeks with no static, all it does it make static, hum very loudly, or make clicking sounds. You cannot hear the baby when he cries and one can defintely not sleep with all that sound. This monitor is useless and I am very disappointed in the quality. Hopefully Target will take it back!"
4,Impressed,"I bought this monitor because of the great price, and we love it. The reception is great (and very sensitive); you can hear the baby moving around and it even picks up noise from other rooms. We have a shop in the backyard that has florescent lights that makes the reception a little staticy so we turn the volume down and watch for the lights. We were very impressed by this monitor."
3,Sound N Lights Monitor,I thought this would be a good monitor because I really like the Fisher-Price brand but I can not use this monitor without having a bunch of static! I have tried everything possible that it says in the booklet that comes with it but still get lots of static. I am going to take this product back!!
5,Works VERY well in our home,"We purchased this recently as my husband is hearing impaired. It works VERY well, and I even started using it just to make sure I hear the baby as soon as she starts to wake. It's funny because I could also hear the dog barking outside in the background, so knew I needed to go deal with him :-). I like the ability to turn down the sound while watching TV and still have the lights to monitor the baby. I know situations can be different depending on other electronic devices in use in your area, but static and reception has not been a problem for us so far."
1,No better than the others,"I just bought this monitor after fussing with another brand for a few months. I thought the Fisher-Price brand would offer better quality. When it works, it is very sensitive and I can hear my baby breathing, but it doesn't usually work. When it's plugged in, there is this low buzzing that bothers me while I sleep and I am a heavy sleeper. When it's on battery power, it gets nothing but static if I put it down. I have to hold the antenna to keep the static away. NOT very convenient. I have tried all the recommendations in the directions to no avail. Plus sometimes, the sound just cuts in and out like my baby's on a cell phone and I can't hear him at all for several seconds. So, it looks like another trip to the store to try something else."
2,Static problems,"It was a little static-y when we got it, but after a few months of use, it developed a serious problem. At odd intervals, it would make a VERY loud static sound and jolt me out of my sleep! About the time I'd get back to sleep, it would do it again. Adjusting the volume made no difference. It went out with the trash, and I slept in the baby's room till I could get a different one!"
4,Satisfied,We purchased this monitor for our first child and have been using it for almost 18months now. We have had no problems with it. We have two receivers so we leave on in our bedroom and move the other to wherever we are. Everything still works fine.
1,It's cheap for a reason...,"This is the WORST monitor we've had so far. The only way to get rid of the static and/or humming noise is to turn the receiver off! We got it yesterday, and it's not getting another chance. I would rather sleep on her hardwood floor in her room than listen to all the noise from this monitor."
2,Don't Buy It,"I enjoyed this monitor for 3 months. I tried using batteries with it at first but there was too much static. So I always had it plugged in. Now after 3 months no matter what room I try to listen or what channel, I can't hear anything over the static. My advise is to buy a different system."
4,Great monitor and Great price!,"I personally love this. Very little static at all and has a decent enough range for me to do the things that I need to do away from her. Best of all, this thing picks up EVERYTHING. Baby hardly needs to make a sound and this little gadget will pick it up, which gives me peace of mind when I can't be right there next to her and want to make sure I dont miss a THING(accidents only take a second). I feel secure using this monitor to listen to my baby while away. I haven't had any real static problems as long as I follow the very easy to understand directions. Anytime I pick up alot of static all I have to do is change channels and it's fine. Simple to operate as well. Allover I'd recommend it, especially if your on a budget."
3,I agree with Tracey!,"It works better than my last monitor. We don't get static or phone calls anymore. It absolutley eats batteries. I can't believe there isn't some other way to recharge them. I would consider this a major flaw, since the idea of a monitor is to be able to move around the house and still hear your baby. I have been pluging it in wherever I go, since my daughter takes a 3 hour nap. The battery lasted 2 days!!!!!!!! It does hum when plugged in, too."
1,The Picture is Deceiving,"Buyer Beware! This watch does NOT look nearly as good as it does in the photo.What appears to be distinctive dark red and grey markings on the dial face in the photoare actually pale in color. As a result, the dial face has the look ofa cheap $25 Timex."
2,Art Without Color,"The lover of art deco will certainly love this book for its content. A major drawback is that there are very few color illustrations. The cover boasts that there are 22 illustrations in full color (out of 363 total). However, this amounts to only 14 pages of color illustrations. Color is vital to art deco and to under represent it is a fatal flaw."
3,Horse Racing Game,"I reviewed this item once. It was sent in a timely fashion, and I was satisfied. We haven't had time to play"
4,fun for the whole family,I bought this game because I had played one like it and wanted to get my own. When I got it the rest of the family really enjoyed playing. It can also be used to understand probability and odds of certain numbers appearing on the dice. A lot of fun.
3,Poor quality,"I loved the game. It is very fun to play, but the board itself was very cheaply made and was warped. The top layer of veneer wood had lifted up off the board and so the horses don't slide very easily. My husband is trying to figure out a way to squeeze glue under the layer and clamp it without interfering with the slide slots."
2,substandard quality,"The game is cheaply made, parts are missing or marked up, directions are inadequate, and the dice enclosed are about the size of a pea!!"
3,Horse racing,"This is a fun game but my game came with 2 9's instead of a 6 and 9, cost to much to send it back so just have to watch when a 6 and 9 are rolled. I like the game because a lot of people can play this together at one table."
4,Fun! Fun! Fun!,My family loves this game. I have four kids ages 14-5. We all can play it together and we love including other families in to the fun.
3,Lousy workmanship on horse racing board,The Horse Racing game is set up well but the quality of the playing board is very poor. My game arrived with a section chipped off. Also one side edge had not been glued and tended to warp up. It required a bit of woodworking glue and clamps to mend this feature.
2,"Horse Race Game-have to return one, bought two","I bought two of these games after playing with a group at Thanksgiving. One game seems to work fine, but one is warped so a couple of the horses do not move freely in the slot. It can be a lot of fun at a party with some whooping and hollering going on. I hope I do not have trouble making an exchange. I will keep you posted."
1,Disappointment,"A frined of mine had the game and it was fun playing with the family therefore, I tracked down your site where the game could be purchased. I wanted the game to be made of wood like my friend's so it would be durable. When I received the two games (one was a gift for my neice) I was very disappointed. The quality and workmanship was way below my expectation and far below the game that my friend purchased in Canada. The pieces do not move freely and the top surface would seem to break very easly. Based on this purchase, I would question any further purchases."
4,excellent read,Just discovering this author and am delighted to read anything he writes so far. This one is another great title I highly recommend.
5,Dick Francis Revisited,Great book - I hadnt read it in a number of years and realized it was one of the few Dick Francis' books I didnt havein hardcover so bought it. It was definitely worth the re-read and investment Classic Dick Francis.
1,boring stupid predictable english crap,"Uneventful fluff about british horse racing. No mystery, no murder, a good way to kill time as well as brain cells."
4,First dolls for 17 month old twin girls.,"My beautiful little twin grand-daughters are 16 months, almost 17 months old. Their Mom suggested these dolls as a Christmas gift for them. When they got them on Christmas morning, they basically ignored their other toys and gifts and carried the dolls around and immediately tried to ""feed"" them with the little bottles that were provided. It made this grand-mother very happy!!!"
2,Disappointing,"I ordered these dolls about a month in advance of my daughter's first birthday and will now be shopping for an alternative in the two weeks remaining before her party. The dolls are not exactly misrepresented in the description here and other reviews but I was disappointed to find that the ""soft bodies"" are filled with very insubstantial pillow fluff, which is contained within their sewn-on pink and green outfits. Based on the description provided, I had hoped there would rather be a little more weight to the dolls and would have liked for the outfits to be changeable over some kind of flesh-colored fabric for the bodies. Also, the hospital bracelets and baby booties are molded and painted into the plastic for the arms and legs. So, those features are also irremovable. Not a bad product for the money but not exactly what I had hoped or expected. Just wanted to give other mommies some more information."
1,NOT THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS!,"I recently tried to listen to this album and was sickened to hear that it is horrible rerecordings and not the original hits that I have heard on the oldies radio stations and it doesn't even sound like Herman's Hermits, I'm just so glad that I didn't buy this and the person I know who did was at least lucky that she got it at a garage sale and didn't pay too much for it. I have listened to rerecordings that were good but this one is lousy!"
1,Not enough info,"The CD cover calls it Herman's Hermits Greatest Hits, but gives no indication of who sings the songs. From the look of the cover, it might be Peter Noone singing solo. Without the song list, or who is actually singing, I would not purchase this CD. Peter Noone still tours, and this could be a collection of recently recorded music. A CD of HH's Greatest Hits has been out for a few years, and it has the original recordings."
3,Great in patches but Elena is too remote and gives no insigh,"This starts with a bang (literally!) and has some great erotic moments, but the sessions with Elena give no real insight as to her motivations (apart from lust for her Breton Knight). I would have liked to hear more of Elena's erotic feelings. There's no doubting she's got them. Elena is reputably cold and unemotional, and I suspect that the author has placed too great a distance between herself and Elena in trying to convey this aspect of our heroine. For my money Henriette is far sexier - she at least has the courage of her convictions and is willing to totally abandon herself to pleasure, something that Elena could never really do."
4,Totally unique,"The only way to describe this album is good, that's about all I can say. It's hard enough trying to find, ne, create, a musical category this would fit into without having to delve into my thesaurus for synonyms. Beta Band use samples more wisely (and originally) than Beck or the Beastie Boys, but they sound nothing like either of those artists. If I was going to describe this album, I'd say it's like damp midnight in the country with a completely twisted 21st century pop band playing in the dark 10 miles away. There is no wasted space on this album; every noise, instrument, and sample is there for a reason. Some bands pretend how to play. Beta Band know what they are doing."
3,It's ok,"I just couldn't really get into this release. There's really nothing wrong with it, but there's not much right with it. Much of the material seems quirky for its own sake. There just doesn't seem to be as much structure to these songs as there was on the three EPs release (these songs seem almost confused).Compared to the three EPs, this disc just doesn't do much for me. I would really recommend getting the 3 EPs first, and if you like it move on to this release."
1,hmm...,"I love the beta band yet this album is quite disappointing. If you are trying to get into the band, then I would advise you to have a look at the first or third album. It's only redeeming song which I love is ""it's not too beautiful"" and as a single gets 5 stars.This album might in twenty years time become something of a cult classic which will garner the sort of respect that the Rolling Stone's ""Satanic Majesty's Request"" now has. But avoid in the meantime."
2,Not as good as the others,"This is the weakest of the Beta Band's CD's. In fact, it's pretty lousy, I regret to say. When the BB come out with a Greatest Hits, it'll inlcude maybe two songs from this otherwise dismal effort."
2,Ughh...If I have to listen to this one more time I'll die.,"It's a good thing I bought the 3ep's album first, because if this one would have been my first BetaBand experience I would have never given them a 2nd chance. ""Round the Bend"" is the only enjoyable song on the album. Everything else is excruciatingly repetitive and/or rather annoying.I don't make snap judgements because I am a lover of all kinds of music. But even after a good 5+ complete listenings and giving it all of my attention with each listen, this album continues to repel me. It now sits in my ""resale"" pile waiting to be returned to the CD store. I really like the 3ep's album...but not this one."
5,Like Pink Floyd... But a lot more laid back,"I heard a track of theirs on a CMJ disc and enjoyed it. I'm the person who prefers some of Beck's 'Mutations' rather than his other stuff, meaning I like the rhythyms and textures but nothing to aggressive. I compare their sound a bit to Pink Floyd because something about their keyboard work reminds me of Floyd's Richard Wright. They do have a bit of early Syd Floyd to them also. Here in Chicago, I hear a lot of experimental music that eschews melody and harmony but comes near losing music. The Beta Band doesn't go so far to the edge, making an enjoyable ride whose music engages the mind and ear on close listening, but is also perfect background music for hanging out with friends."
4,A musical joyride,The Beta Band offers up a wide range of musical styles on the album and within each song. Songs take surprising twists and turns. This creates a pleasantly refreshing meandering quality. Who really wants to listen to songs that are predictable? Bravo Beta Band for having the courage to inventively shatter the norm!
1,Forgetaboudit!,"This is a great concept which is very poorly executed. I just posted a picture of what this brush looks like after my lab spent less than five minutes with the brush, used as directed. If Kong can make ""chew proof"" black rubber chew toys it seems to me this company could do better! Do not waste your money if your dog is large and has strong teeth!"
4,good value for cost,"These are really cute in person. The quality isn't super great, but for the low cost I think they are a good buy."
4,Works great but it is smelly,"When I read the first review on this vacuum about it being smelly, I thought maybe not all of them would have the same issue. Since it was the strongest wet/dry cordless hand vacuum that I could find, I decided to order it anyway. It's a lot more powerful than our old 7.2 volt wet/dry Dustbuster. But, the smell that it gives off when in use is pretty strong. So, if you don't really need the wet pick-up feature too much (I don't pick up wet messes with the vacuum as often as I thought I would), I would recommend the Black & Decker CHV1400 14.4-Volt Cyclonic DustBuster. It's gotten pretty good reviews and our Black & Decker held up well over the years."
1,Product is bad... customer service is non-existent!!! :o(,"This product is horrible! I own mine for approximately 6 months or so. As others have mentioned, there is a nasty smell emitted when you use it and there is NO storage for the accessories.MY problem is that the battery no longer charges. I followed directions not to leave it on the charger all the time in order to prolong battery life. I would use it a few times before recharging. Eventually, I had to recharge it after each use. NOW, the battery does not charge at all!I have tried many times to contact customer service via email. Never received a response! I have tried to contact customer service via telephone. A receptionist answers and says she is transferring to customer service, but no one picks up the phone.I would personally recommend staying AWAY from this product!"
1,is it supposed to make this noise?,"I bought this vacuum with a singular function in mind. I wanted to clean up my son's cheerio mess without a broom. since dry cheerios are light, anything should pick them up. This vacuum performed perfect for the first day. After that, it started making a slight noise when in use. Then picking it up and using it caused a loud noise. Then finally, I figured out the problem. The vacuum rotor popped off the motor spindle. It fell apart after less than 2 days. While it may work great for the first day, I can't recommend a product which only lasts two days of light use. Very poor quality control."
2,Not much of a hand vac.,"I've been very disappointed in this unit. It has a cheap feel about it,and I don't think it's very well balanced, weight wise. Most important, the suction is not very good for a unit of this size. I've also not been happy with the lack of storage for the included tools. You'd be much better off with a B&D Dust Buster - little more expensive, but worth it."
1,bad product,We have had other hand vacuum's and we expected this to be a good product. To our disappointment we do not care for it at all. It does not pick up and it seems to be on low battery set up. We are ready to throw it out and purchase a different brand.
3,ReadiVac,"This was a gift that my Sister asked for. I picked it from Amazon so I could review a few of them. I don't personally know how good it works or how good it is holding out but, just after she received it she said she really liked it."
2,At best an uneven foundation,"After the publisher's excellent FOUNDATIONS OF ECOLOGY I was all set for an equally good set of papers and commentaries on Behaviour. Alas 'tis not yet to be! While this collection has some useful stuff it is by no means as far reaching or as selective as the ECOLOGY volume. Although the editors have picked out some key pieces, many of the papers reprinted here have vanished into deserved obscurity, and one emerges at the end with as long a list of ""should have been includeds"" as one went in with. Animal Behaviour was (and is) far more dynamic and exciting than this Foundation would have us think & I find that this volume stays in a remarkably pristine condition on my shelf rather than in the proper place for a good book -much marked up & in the eager hands of an enthusiastic student!"
2,could have been a whole lot better,"Credits are important. They help define the creative process and guide the viewer's point of view. We like to know what we are watching, especially nostalgic compilations like this. Other than a few brief liner notes, the DVD does not impart enough information and leaves the viewer disappointed. The Duke is great, this DVD is not."
3,I know I should like this but I don't,"You see, this is well crafted, intelligent music, but somehow the 'techre have completely left out any soul. This CD could have been created entirely by machines with no human intervention at all - because of this coldness I find it difficult to connect with, on any level. Maybe that's the point. This would be an excellent soundtrack to a film about the thought processes of a (psychotic) computor."
5,Precision music artfully decayed,"Like Kraftwerk soundfiles buried and exhumed, Autechre's music has the regularity of organic forms decayed. It seems to want to recover its structure as if it were running an endless unsuccessful defrag on itself, and the sadness of this struggle gives the music tremendous weight and melancholy. Going beyond the massive but stuttering creativity of Chiastic Slide, LP5 re-renders techno as a timeless natural form."
5,"Quirky, but endearing","If you like to color outside the lines this is the sound for you. Brilliant and sometimes a bit eccentric, the tracks never cease to intrigue and impress. Reminds me of some of the more metallic Coil songs I enjoy. A prime collection of sounds I thoroughly recommend to those with unusual or experimental taste. Resisting characterization and classification, something that must be heard to be understood."
2,Very low budget flick,"Yep, nothing to do with Lizzie Borden, not even the facts or depictions of the house or parents are realistic (I know, I recently was at the original Borden house). Very low budget gore flick, even the axe wackings are not realistic, bad effects.But.... if you have an imagination, you will love the sausage link (intestines) that come oozing out, and the unexpected head whacking."
1,Beware!,"Beware! This is listed under Elizabeth Montgomery movies on Amazon, but it is NOT the made-for-TV movie she starred in!It is actually quite possibly the WORST movie ever released on DVD. Script, acting, special effects, you name it, it was awful.PLEASE don't waste your money!It is not one star -it is negative stars..."
3,Not about Lizzie Borden,"Because there was nothing written about this movie, I thought is was about Lizzie Border but it's not. Also very gory.Not what I thought I was buying & not really pleased with it.It takes place in California. And is stupid."
2,Lizzie Borden movie,This was not what I expected. I apparently ordered the wrong thing. This movie was a low budget movie. Good thing I didn't spend a lot of money.
1,Wow that sucked,"This movie is so awful! It's based on a person who was accused of killing her parents in Fall River Massachusetts.... Not California. How did Lizzie get to the West Coast??? did she take a plane?? The acting is terrible, The lead male was worst of all, I can't even type how terrible he was. I would advise you to see for yourself, but you will need to take a shower after the movie because it makes you feel gross inside. And to top it all off Lizzie gets beat with a punch in the face at the end. A punch in a face, not an explosion or stabbed with her own weapon! A stupid punch in the face. Damn this movie sucks......."
2,Lizzie Boreden,The Lizzie Borden story has always been interesting to me. Been to the Lizzie Borden house. read books about her. And I have to say the best movie about Lizzie Borden was the one played by Elizabeth Montgomery.
4,Excellent deep house,"Great two disk set. Not as hot as Jay-J reflections but worthy of a purchase. Best tracks (in my opinion) are No, No, No, The best part, and I think I."
5,True House,"Defected scores again. It seems their one of the very limited lables releasing good down home house. This cd is like the rest of their releases, you won't find that anoying high energy cookie cutter tracks for people who can't dance here. Enjoy!!"
2,Snorkling Instead of Scuba Diving,"I was looking for practical Godly wisdom and application, but I did not find it in this book. I was also looking for real millenium situations that pastors wives today, have to endure; however, there were none in this book. I was basically disappointed as the author is a seasoned pastor's wife; but she really had it good compared to most pastors' wives today. No insight into this peculiar calling and profession was found in this publication."
4,Useful Reference,"In clear, precise diagrams and thoughtful text, author Simon Unwin offers an engaging methodology for the study of architecture and aesthetic systems. Time-tested buildings from classical temples to traditional Japanese homes and early modernist masterpieces, are explored in this wide ranging, but focused study. Unwin demonstrates that while architectural styles change over time, the underlying principles that organize quality designs remain remarkably consistent.This book is a must for all architectural students interested in acquiring the visual skills needed to understand a wide variety of design methodologies. My only criticism is that proportion and scale were not given enough attention, but there are many other books that cover this important topic separately.Intelligently considered, and clearly presented, `Analysing Architecture' is a refreshing counterpoint to the sort of pretentious, self-serving rubbish that Eisenman, Libeskind, Hadid, et al try to pass off as design."
3,"So, so",I used this text for a architecture class I was enrolled in. The figure/ground drawings are useful.
3,Pretty,"I bought this to complete the set in my car. I love the Moonsprite, I think it's very pretty. The one thing I didn't like was that it's not as good quality as the seat covers are. The fabric isn't the same (the color or thickness) and the picture of the Moonsprite isn't as good. Other then that I like it a lot."
4,Beautiful Illustrations,It is a beautifully illustrated book about 'globe shaped' cactus - but those only - None of the other shapes are included.
4,I usually like Timber Press,"Pictures in this book are excellent with descriptions that allow for fairly positive identification. Plates are true to color and notations discuss variation in species. Unlike most books by Timber Press, the binding is of poor quality. Still, an excellent reference for beginners like myself."
