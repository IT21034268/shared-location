1,Deeply Dented Cans,"The order arrived with most of the cans very badly dented. This soup is thin and watery. The only ""chunky"" about it is that there are a couple of pieces of potato which are cut rather large. There are very few vegetables and little beef; the beef is tough and stringy."
4,Murder in Belgravia Court,"Jack C. Davis's first published novel is an enjoyable read. What Robert Parker is to culinary, Jack Davis is to culture. Although at times it seemed gratuitous, his travelogue of Louisville, Kentucky made the setting and charter development very real and readable. This ""who done it"" will keep you hypothesizing and then re-evaluating throughout the book. Bob Watson, the main character, portrayed as a man of intellect and compassion is very believable. A Spenser without the rough edges. You will not want to put this book down, but if you must, rest assured that when you resume you will immediately be back in story. Good work Mr. Davis!"
3,It's serviceable,"I use this case frequently, but the plastic belt clip did break in the first couple of weeks of having it. It's a sturdy piece though."
3,great case crappy sponge,the case is great and sells at shops for 25+ dollars but the sponge in my caddy was thin and did not hold the moisture in. I took it out and bought a drymistat tube with the clear crystals and filled it with the xikar solution and it works great. Maintains a 70% rh.
3,Cigar Caddy 3400,"Caddy is bigger that I thought it would be, I think that my expectations in that are were unrealistic. The clips holding the unit shut pop off if you are not careful when you open it. I am thinking about supper glueing them in place as a fix. Other than this caddy does all that it is suppose to."
5,Perfect for a weekend golf trip,"I bought this specifically for a weekend golf trip with the guys. Kept the cigars safe in the golf bag, also water tight, and keeps them humidified. Love this thing!"
5,Great for travel or to keep at work,"Received the product very fast and in perfect shape. The item is as described and has completely met and exceeded my expectations. I would definitely order this again and I'm glad I read all the reviews first. In response to the Negative reviews below, I have not found them to be accurate.I like to call it my work humi as i leave a couple of smokes at works for those random unannounced ioccasions to light up."
4,Decent cigar protector,"I'm petty pleased with this purchase. The box its well conducted and provides protection for my cigars. The main reason I purchased it was for the boat. It is water and crush proof so I don't have to worry about accidentally damaging my cigars while out in the weather. If your looking for the humidifier to be the main reason for buying this, think again. Don't get me wrong, at least there is an effort to keeping your cigars fresh but there's really no way of knowing if its effective out not. I never keep them in it other than transit between humidors. I like to think of it a an armored truck used for protecting my most precious possessions between vaults!"
3,"Close, but no cigar","Nice compact size for traveling. However, you must be careful and not put too much liquid in the humidor dial. If you do, the top layer of stored cigars will get soggy. One of the latches on mine snapped off as soon as I opened the case. I didn't have time to return as I was deployed in Iraq at the time."
2,Cigar holder,Bought this for a gift. Extremely hard to open. At times almost impossible. I would have given it a one except that it does protect the cigars - you just can't get to them!
1,Exceeded its shelf life,"I had used Permatex epoxy in the past and had been satisfied with the product and its adhesion properties. The packets seem to be sealed, I am not sure which is which, but either the hardener or the resin had a dried thick skin, so the glue was pretty much un-usable."
5,Godfather Soundtrack a Musical Institution,"One of the many elements of ""The Godfather"" which makes it an icon of pop culture is its unforgettable soundtrack. The melancholy, tragic music which makes up the score adds to the tone of the film, and stands alone as great music as well. The sweet, dark, Italian-inspired melodies immediately recall entertainment brilliance."
2,Watch the movie.,This soundtrack to the awesome film just doesn't feel right. Watch the movie and enjoy Nino Rota's score in all its glory.
4,wonderful CD for those who like music without words,This soundtrack is relaxing yet invigorating and sometimes I get so enveloped in the music that I put my stereo on repeat and listen to it the entire night. This record is fabulous.
5,the best soundtrack,"I, coming from a big Itailin family from New York, love this soundtrack. Need I say more?"
5,Hand-n-Hand with the film,very solid disc.the music captures the many complex moments of the film.it brings so much more texture to the film.this is one of the few films ever made that you can watch the film and listen to the music at the same time.pure genius.
3,Missing a favorite track and poor mastering,"While I love the usual favorite tracks, there is a theme played on a lone, upright piano that is missing on this release. It brilliantly supports the scene that scopes the aftermath results of the hit in Dempsey's restaurant. A release of the original master-recording would be nice; this copy is too dull sounding and has numerous imperfections typical of early releases. This is to good of a score to sound this bad."
3,"Good cover, but mine tends to get blown off","I like the cover - it fits well. I purchased mine at another retailer, and it is a different color and lacks the Weber logo, but is a Weber brand. That said, mine blows off the grill. Fortunately, I've always been able to find it. It happens maybe once a month. YMMV. It fits over the tool hanger accessory I have on mine, and saves me carrying the grill in and out of my garage. It shows no signs of wear after a hot Texas summer."
4,Works but soils,"The cover has protected my Weber from rain and snow for five years. It is robust. My only complaint is that the black soils and when washed, dirt remains -- in the form of white spots."
3,Good cover but lightweight,"Ours blew off the kettle in a storm. Same happened to our neighbor's. Ideally, it would be heavier, or have some weights in the base. However, it's only happened a few times and when the cover is on it's great."
5,Weber makes great products,"Can't go wrong with buying weber products. Cover looks great, made to last. Fits great will not blow off, also bought the App from weber for Ipad. Well worth the $[...]. I give it 5 stars. [...]."
1,Not big enough. Cracking,"My Weber grill came with this cover and a brace in the back of the grill that nicely holds the lid. The Weber cover does not fit this grill unless I disassemble the brace in the back - we are talking screws and bolts. With stretching and effort you can get the cover over half of the grill but that's it. It seems a cover should fit the grill without disassembly. This cover also shows cracking and bubbling on the inner layer of material. No, I didn't try to put it on while the grill was hot. I am looking for a replacement."
1,The wind got it,"It doesn't look like it, but as other reviewers have noted, high wind (around 50 mph) will cause this cover to disappear. It flew off once, it didn't go far, I thought it was a fluke. The second time, it was gone for good. I experimented with the cheaper cover, it also flew off, never to be found. If Weber ever comes up with a more secure design, maybe I'll try that, for now the grill is uncovered (with the lid bungeed down)."
2,"great looks, however not well comatible with Apple's Magic Mouse",mousepad looks supergood. texture material is excellent. sticks very well to the table... I'd put 5 stars out of 5 if I wouldn't own a new Apple's Magic Mouse.. texture seems to be confusing the mouse a lot.. diagonal drags over the pad make mouse go zig-zag over the screen...you're all good if you use mouse with a wheel.
3,A Bit Heavy for a Laptop Bag,"I need a mousepad to cart around in my laptop bag.The MouseRug is as beautiful (and of course functional) as it looks in the ad. It securely wraps over an armchair arm or clings to a glass tabletop. The top surface feels great; the fringe is fun.I imagined something more like a rug: cloth with a rubber backing. This is the opposite: dense black rubber foam with a cloth-like top surface. It's not as thick as old-style pre-optical mousepads, about 3mm of rubber and .5mm of cloth, but it's going to add significant weight to the bag (when you first get a laptop you don't imagine how all the little doodads are going to add up on your shoulder).I don't know whether cutting the rubber thickness down to 1mm would work in the manufacturer's special printing process, but I hope they come up with a significantly lighter generation.So, three stars because I'm not sure I can afford to take it where I need it."
5,"Fantastic,Brilliant,Deserved its' reward",I read this book some years back but i thought it was fantastic.A little boy makes friends with a teenage girl who has a terrible secret.
4,Great book with hard hitting reality,"Came Back To Show You I Could Fly is about an eleven year old boy named Seymour who meets Angie an older avdenturous drug addict, but Seymour does not know this. She is in a great deal of debt to drug dealers and have been dissowned by her family. Seymour too, is having family problems. This is a great book for readers 12 years and onwards."
4,Came back to show you I could fly by Robin Klein,"The novel is about a boy named Seymour, who stays with a fussy old guardian who wont let him out, worried his father might take him away. By chance one day he left the house and met a young girl called Angie, who lives in a messy little flat, renting from an old women. Angie keeps Seymour company by taking him to different places around the suburbs, going shopping and catching trams from here to there. With her little 'so called brother' nagging her to do the right things. But what Seymour dosent know is that Angie is taking drugs."
2,It even Annoys my son,I bought this for christmas last year for my 2 and 5 year olds. It was cute for the first few mintues then its just plain annoying. They will play with him occasionally but have no intrest in turning him on and neither do I.
3,So far so good...,"After I purchased this toy for my 4-year old daughter, I cringed as I read the reviews. Turns out, Sponge Bob does not hate us as stated in an earlier review, what he's actually saying is, ""Now, I shake YOU!"" referring to the feature where he can talk if you shake him. This was the only toy my daughter asked for this year and it has given her hours of fun. Educational? Not particularly, but she finds it amusing and isn't that what it's all about?"
2,Eye Popping SpongeBob hates me!,"What a fun toy, I said to myself, as did my 4 year old, after purchasing Eye poppin SpongeBob. Our family has enjoyed watching Sponge Bob on Nickelodeon for the past year, and so it was natural to buy such a silly and lighthearted toy. But, when we got it home we were unfortunately harassed by this toy saying, ""Oh, now I hate you."" It is too bad that those in charge at Nickelodeon are so very uncreative, and lame, to make such a negative phrase come out of what should be a fun and silly toy.Nickelodeon failed tremendously, we returned our Eye Poppin SpongeBob. If we want to hear about hate we'll watch a documentary on Hitler."
1,Don't buy this product,"I prefer all natural remedies so I thought this product would be a good buy. After ONE dosage it made me feel weird and sort of ill so I figured I would be able to return it, as all vitamin shops usually accept returns. I would not have wasted my money on this if I knew it would make me ill and the seller would not take it back, the supplements belong in the garbage. I would look up all the ingredients in this before buying, some of the ""all natural"" ingredients in it have been known to have undesirable side effects. Will never purchase from this seller again."
1,Unintuitive Phone,"While the design is attractive and sleek, I really dislike this phone. The menus are complicated and unintuitive. Retrieving messages is such a hassle. Plus, you can't play the messages aloud. I've decided to chuck this phone and move back to Panasonic. I wholeheartedly do not recommend this phone."
2,disappointing,"This phone has been quite disappointing. The buttons do not seem to respond well, and it has been particularly difficult to delete messages. As a result, the messages build up until the phone has to be unplugged to clear the mailbox. I would not recommend this phone to anyone."
4,Good Product,"*** Update - 1 year later ***The included NiCad batteries became almost unusable after a few months. Replaced them with standard NiMh and their life is far greater.Other than that, no problems, and I'll probably add more handsets later on.Bought this just after buying an AT&T; 2.4 GHz phone to compare. No comparison - the AT&T; was very noisy, to the point of almost being unusuable.Good features: Excellent sound qualitySo-so features: Looks, silly ring tonesBad features: Because everything is done from the handset - no buttons on the station - all the features are accessed through the handset menus. This makes making any change a chore. Not a good choice if you lack the patience to work out how to use it.I'm very happy with it though."
3,Nice phone,This is a nice phone i like the led on top the blinks when it rings... lets u easily locate it at night or early morning...good menu system.Only major problem is no paging from the base... I loose the handset all the time !! go find it....Reception is good upto 150feet.
2,No Support,"I have had the 4015 for over a year. The other day, the base unit locked up. I called ""customer care"", it was anything but. Their recommendation to me was to buy another 4015 unit, at [full price]. I have 2 other handsets, so I am pretty much locked into buying another unit or trying to sell the ones I have. They have no service option, and don't allow you to purchase just the base unit. I really liked the performance of the unit, but can not recommend it due to the complete lack of service options."
1,Drops Calls and Connects Poorly,"If you are on the phone more than 20 minutes at some point the phone will start beeping and you will be disconnected for no reason. I own 3 handsets and it does this with all of them. Also, sometimes when answering the phone the connection is made so poorly that you cannot hear the person on the line. JUNK."
1,Can you hear me now?,"I have these phones sitting in a box waiting for me to get around to selling them to someone on eBay. I feel a little bit guilty about that because they were so useless in my home. Granted we have an old stone house with thick walls, but the Uniden cordless phones I got to replace these work fine.When I called the company to see what to do about the ceaseless popping, buzzing and dropped signals they advised that the phone was not for distance but for security so I should talk in the same room as the base stand. Silly really. Don't waste your money."
1,Not as advertised!,"If you're looking for a 4 phone system, do not buy the 4015! It only supports 3 handsets total. You have to buy the 4010 or the 4200 series if you want 4 phones. Siemens does a terrible job of communicating this. Some places in the manual say 3, some say 4, and the website even says 6. When I pointed this out to customer support, they didn't seem to care. Also, in my house the extention handsets had terrible clicking static, rendering them useless. I had high hopes for this product, but had to return it."
2,I Did Read the Manual,"I don't think any cordless phones are perfect, but I don't care for this phone other than the style. It's answering machine is not real intuitive and the speaker is underpowered if any background noise in the room while you try to play messages (we went back to voicemail). Reception in and around our house is just so-so as well. Our other 2.4 gig phone is a similarly priced Panasonic and reception is better, hands down. Bottom line, people can have different experiences with the same phone for whatever reasons, but I find it curious the price seems to be dropping quickly for this unit and a rebate still applies."
1,Do not buy these phones!,"These phones are awful. I purchased one 2415 and three 2400 for my house, and it has been a terrible disaster. Phones sound ALL the time with interference.Siemens has a card inside that says: ""do not return to the store, call Siemens for assistance"". My units have been replaced twice, and now that I want my money back, neither Amazon or Siemens will do it. They blame alarm systems, DSL cable modems, anything. I am very dissapointed in both Amazon and Siemens for putting up such low quality products in the market, and with such bad service."
3,"Phone is fine, but the answering machine is so so.","The phone has a sleek design. It has many advanced features only seen in celluar phones. If you own a celluar phone, you don't need to worry about comments regarding hard-to-get-used in the beginning.This is my first 2.4Ghz phone set. While the reception range is larger, I don't see any significant improvement in the reception quality from my old Panasonic 900mhz one. Most of the times I can hear tiny statics in the background. This takes one star off.The answering machine is poorly designed. You can't delete all the exisitng messages at once. You have to do it one by one. Not clever! Now I even mess up with the answering machine by pressing other buttons accidentally while listening to it. It is kind of in short circuit. So far I still don't know how to fix it. That is another star off."
3,Bells and whistles,"But what if you don't care about bells and whistles? Nice phone, but doesn't anybody make an intuitive phone/answering machine that flashes brightly when there are messages and has a simple large button that you press to retrieve those messages?The menu is easy to navigate through, and the instructions are great. The audio quality of the message playback really doesn't impress me."
1,"Ineffective, Fault Prone Technology","I bought a Siemens Gigaset 4015 and several 4000 handsets a year ago, and have had nothing but trouble with them. They cut off phone calls in mid-conversation, and are so unreliable, I can no longer use them. I've called Siemens Technical Support multiple times, and am given useless troubleshooting tips. What's been my solution? I bought an inexpensive AT&T cordless phone from my local drugstore, and it works like a charm. The low $ AT&T phone beats the higher $$$ Siemens phones hands down. I don't buy all the excuses that try to make up for the Siemens cordless products' faults -- my AT&T cordless works like a champ in a home that has a wireless network, where I use my microwave, and where I do all the other everyday things a good phone should be able to handle."
2,Fade out,"I got this unit & a 2nd. hand set,I found them easy to set up & use, however after a few months the LCD screens on both started to fade out, I called mfg. & they said they would replace units if I'd send them to them, not knowing how long I'd wait for replacements to arrive I bought a Uniden 5.8 unit (with extra handset) which I'd rate at 5 stars after appox. 6 months of use."
1,Problems with this expensive phone,"I purchased this phone early in the year, and was very happy with it. Then, it stopped working. The display on the handset was flashing and also had lost many of the menu items. I called Siemens support and they told me that the problem was a bad handset. I shipped the handset off to them and received a new one. The exact problem existed. I called back Siemens and they told me it must be a bad base. I needed to send them the bill for proof of purchase (apparently the policy had changed between the original troubleshooting) and they would make arrangements to have the base replaced. I am frustrated that their original troubleshooting didn't point to the base. It would have saved me a lot of time and bother. Now I hope I can find the original bill or I'm out of 100 bucks. From now on I'll stick to simple, basic cheap phones."
1,Returned It,"Lousy sound quality: either an echo effect or just kind of fuzzy. All functions done through handset, which turns out to be a real pain. Thumbs down."
1,Do Not Buy This Product,I'm not a smart man but I'm not a crazy man either. I bought this phone and for a couple of weeks it was the best thing since Penelope Cruz in Open Your Eyes. Then one day it stopped working forever and I wept. Save yourself the pain and weeping. Buy a different brand.
1,Worst phone I ever owned,"I do not have this model, but I've had three of the 2410 models. The first phone stopped working within a few months of owning it. Siemen's replaced the phone promptly, but the ""new"" one isn't working either. The caller ID doesn't work well, the display partially burned out, the battery lasts about 24 hours at best, and now I cannot hear the caller, even though the caller can hear me. This is the worst phone that I have ever owned, and I doubt that this newer version would be as good as the other cordless phones on the market."
3,Warning: Only supports a total of three handsets,... This base (Siemens 4015) only supports a total of three handsets.The folks at the Siemens help desk were quite clear on this....Sound quality is good and the intercom system works well....The phone itself is quite nice.
2,Charging problems,The phone has a lot of great features that work great.The bigest problem ive had with the phone is charging the batteries.I am on my third phone only because I cant get all my money back from best buy.I am surprised no one has mentioned this problem in their reviews.Customer support is great but has not been able to solve the charging problems ive had.I have let the phone sit in the charger for 24 hours and the phone goes dead in 5 minutes or it doesnt charge at all I have been sent replacent batteries twice with no luck. I guess it could just be bad luck but three times?
2,"Poor sound quality, annoying popping noise","I reluctantly packaged up my Siemens 4015 for return today. I like the size of the phone and love the rechargable AA batteries but the sound quality was pretty bad. There is a great deal of noise on my phone even when I'm just a few feet from the base. Also, there is this popping noise that drives me crazy. I don't recommend this phone to anyone."
2,There's got to be something better,"My complaint is that, when listening in the handset, I hear too much ""snow"" or air noise. It's not AWFUL, but I wish it wasn't there. I was going to return it but realized I already sent in for the rebate (and as a result the UPC is missing) and so I can't. With all the techonology available these days, I'm sure there's a cordless phone that's better."
2,Can't talk very long,I purchased this phone a couple of years ago and have already had to take it back to the store and replace it twice. The battery life doesn't last more than 10 hours when it is unused and only about 1 1/2 hours if you are talking on it. The clarity on it is great but the phone was not worth [what] I paid for it.
2,Rachael Ray 30 Minute Get Real Meals: Eat Healthy without going to extremes,"I love to cook and I have many different cookbooks and one thing they have in common is they use regular household foods. This is the first Rachael Ray cookbook that I have bought and I was disapointed. As I read the various dishes I realized that there was no way I would have a lot of these ingredients on hand and I would have to buy some unusual items. I made a list of some of the ingredients and on my next trip to the market I looked for them. The few that I could find were very expensive and the others I could not find at all. I asked the store manager where I could possibily find these items and he told me that I would need to go to a speciality food store like Whole Food, Trader Joes etc. Living on a Social Security fixed income these food items would be to costly for my budget. I am not saying these dishes are not good I just can't afford to try them."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in the types of recipes in this book. I love Rachel Ray and her shows - but I was surprised that this book was more about low carbs than healthy options. I am so done with low carb diets and was looking more for a cook, 30 minute prep-time, healthy meal using fresh veggies, but keeping the bread, pasta, potatos - carbs. These are not meals that my 16 year old son, 14 year old daughter or avowed meat and potato husband are interested in."
3,slim pickings,"Maybe I'm old fashioned, but to me ""Get Real"" does not mean masses of recipes with 20-plus ingredients. Out of the more than 170 recipes offered I found only 11 that my husband and I both agreed on, and the one I tried first called for 16 ingredients. That was the Oktoberfest Stoup ... and I must admit it was pretty good ... but get real! I LOVE Rachel Ray's 30-minute meals on TV though, so I probably should have started with that book."
1,"Get Real, Rachael Ray","Rachael Ray tries to tell the world, ""Hey! I'm carb-conscious, too!"" But only for this book, apparently, as ALL her other books are totally loaded with carbs.That this book's subtitle is ""Eat Healthy Without Going To Extremes"" makes me laugh. Eat Healthy? These recipes are LOADED with high-fat and high-calorie ingredients...so what's she talkin' about, Willis? Of course, that would be easy enough for even the stupidest reader to realize IF she posted nutritional info for each recipe, but that's something she NEVER does. (That's a huge beef of mine, but I guess that's another story.)Basically NONE of these recipes are suitable for someone trying to eat healthier. Actually, they don't sound good for anybody. I'm giving this book away!"
2,pricey ingredients,"Although I did find a few delicious meals in this cookbook, about 90% of the entire list wasn't appealing to me. The ingredients also including many items that you probably don't have in your pantry or cabinets. If you're interested, visit a local library and save yourself some money."
3,"Love her, the book...not so much","I love all her shows, and was very excited to get her cookbooks, but was quite disappointed at the lack of photos! I need a photo! hence, I haven't used the book."
2,Wishing For Better...,"Although Rachel Ray has created 30 minute meals that combine interesting flavors, I found that shopping for ingredients was somewhat challenging. Some ingredients, such as dried mushrooms, are incredibly exoensive, while others are just hard to find at my chain grocery store. I also wonder if she actually prepared her recipes as written, because in two that I tried she called for excessive amounts of liquid. I cut back on these recipes by 3 cups of liquid!"
2,Not so real,"I was dissapointed in this book. I am a big fan of Rachael's and her books and TV shows and this book was not what I expected. It is a Low Carb cook book and I did not want that. Nothing in the advertising told me. I don't feel ""Low Carb"" is real for me and would not have purchased it if I had known this was not another wonderful Real food fast from the great collection of Rachael Ray. Some of the recipes are good but not really healthy in my opinion."
1,Horrible & too much Pork,This book is horrible especially if you are someone that doesn't like or prefers not to eat PORK since half the Book requires PORK PRODUCTS. The meals are short but unless you start preparing the items you need - no meal is 30 minutes. Some of the items are Quick but not 1/2 & I am a Great cook that was not satisfied with this book. Sorry :(
4,Healthy WITHOUT extremes! Low carb is extreme!,"As I sat here reading all these complaints about the cookbook not being low carb, it hit me.....low carb is an extreme diet, and the book is called eating healthy without going to extremes.Many popular diets now are extreme, limiting drastically types of foods, such as the low carb diet. Many people mistakenly eat too many fatty meats when on a low carb diet. Rachael Ray has made it easier to eat a BALANCED diet with healthy recipes and controlled portion sizes!So please.....if you are on the EXTREME low carb diets, don't say that this book is not for those who want to eat HEALTHY! Maybe you should eat a more balanced diet!"
3,eh,"well, to be honest, I did not find the recipes in tis book extremely appetizing, they had a lot of meat and cheese and I'm trying to reduce my cholesterol."
3,Not to impressed,"I love Rachel Ray and was hoping to get more out of her cookbooks than I did. However, I did make a spinach dish from this cookbook took less than 30 minutes and was delicious. I also find alot of the ingridents aren't things you might find at your local Vons. Hopefully this is something she works on in the future."
3,Food tastes great but not what I was hoping for,"I was really hoping to find healthy meals that I could put together quickly when I picked up this book.Admittedly, every thing I have made has been absolutely delicious. I give her that. But the calorie and fat content is through the roof on every recipe, and they take a tremendously long time. There is no way on earth that any of these could be put together in 30 minutes. I have spent a minimum of an hour on each recipe, and one took me over 90 minutes. And I do know how to cook."
2,Racheal Ray's 30-minute Get Real Meals: Eat Healthy Without Goimg to Extremes,"I was excited by the reviews I read on this cookbook and the fact that the receipes were not time consuming. How I was very dissappointed. There are many receipes for cooking pork and beef, both of which I eat in very limited portions. Also some spices I am unfamiliar with and would hvae liked to know what part of the grocery store to find them, without having to spend a lot of time searching."
2,Rachael Ray's 30-Minute Get Real Meals: Eat Healthy Without Going To Extremes,The recipes were not conducive to my lifestyle.
2,Not so great,I was really disappointed with this cook book.When my family looked through it they only found one or two things they said they would eat. My family are not picky eaters either.
5,Yummo and lean!,"Another great RR book. These can be made by ""normal"" people in 30 minutes! No cream of mushroom soup-love that! Great tasting-you'll never know you are saving calories. Give it a try. You can trust Rach Ray!"
2,Misconception,I purchased the book believing by the title and the description that I was purchasing a cookbook featuring generally healthier recipes. When I received the book I was surprised to learn that they are all low carb recipes only.
3,Easy but not good recipes,"I have made a lot of recipes from Rachel's show, but I've had this book for a few months now and have yet to make anything in it. I cook a lot, but the recipes just don't sound very good. They are kind of weird! I would recommend that you check out what is in here before purchasing."
5,Dynamite!,"I received this cookbook as a gift and it is just wonderful! I have made the Paremsan Coated Chicken and the Chicken Cacciatore. Both were excellent. I knew the cookbook was a hit when my husband told me the Chicken Cacciatore was the best meal he had ever had, the recipe has been made by everyone in my office to rave reviews all around. I can't wait to try more of the recipes. I enjoy it so much I just bought one for my sister for her birthday."
2,Rachael Ray's 30-Minute Get Real Meals,"Good recipes but no nutritional information per recipe. Not good for those wanting to make sure what they're getting in their ""healthy meals."" One salad recipe called for so much olive oil that the calories were too high just for it."
4,Excellent so far,"I bought this book several years ago... not sure why it has taken me this long to write a review.I've only tried one recipe - Bucatini with Sausage, Peppers, and Onions. For those of you who are complaining that these recipes are no good, you obviously have not tried this one. It's super healthy but delicious.If you're having problems finding ingredients, go online and find substitutes. For goodness sakes. Get creative.The main complaint I have is that I haven't tried more of the recipes because I have no idea what I am making since there are no pictures. Thus, I don't know if something looks like something I would enjoy. Perhaps referencing a website with pictures would help??Anyway, what people are saying about recipes taking more than 30 minutes is true, unless you have a food processor."
3,She's alright,"While I do applaud Rachel for her ""30 Minute Meals"", There really not that healthy and there are quite a number of things you have to go and get. No real nutritional information. Definitely not a low carb book."
5,great,"gift for grandson and he loved it, started reading recipes right awayhis favoeite is rachel ray.thank you so much"
4,good book,"Overall it is a good book with a lot of recipes to choose from. However, there a quite a few recipes in it that I probably will never make. I was hoping some of the these recipes would be a little healthier."
5,"Great recipes, very healthy ""fast food"".","This is an early Rachel Ray cookbook filled with delicious, easy recipes. I was never interested in cooking until I discovered the simple, fast ""30 minute meals"" from Ms. Ray. Love it!"
3,Eh,My sister bought me a few of her cooking books after I got married and started living with my husband. It's just a basic recipe just substituting an ingredient. Lame.
1,Not for me,"I expected fast and flavorful recipes that might fit into a low processed carbs, high protein diet. For one reason or another, none of these recipes appeal to me. Each one had a different reason I wouldn't make it: more meat per serving than I like, large amounts of cheese, too many calories or too much saturated fat. (I've never said I wasn't picky.) If the Atkin's diet works for you this book might be just the ticket. I might try another Rachael Ray cookbook but I would read it before buying."
3,Get Real Rachael! Not everybody can afford to cook like you!,"Our family is trying to stick to a cooking budget more and thought we would try this out. I believe this book to be unrealistic for the majority of America mainly because we don't eat swordfish, capers, use marscapone or cook with many other items that Rachael uses. Her recipes are simple BUT I believe expensive to make with a lot of spices and expensive produce. There were about six recipes out of the entire book that I would consider using, and I can find those on the Food Network's website."
4,Pleasing results right off the bat...,"Just received the book and started with her chili recipe. It is really good. We have only done a few recipes and each one so far is a 5 star winner.We could only give her book 4 stars simply because we are too new to it. We feel we need to do more recipes in the book before we can offer a 5 star opinion.This book has become the first source to consult when we ponder ""whats for dinner?"""
5,Really nice book,"I'm not a great cook, but I bought 2 cookbooks recently and have been really happy about it. Rachael Ray's 30-Minute Get Real Meals: Eat Healthy Without Going to Extremes and Simple and Simply Delicious by Sylvie Rocher. Those 2 books are great! They have simple to follow recipe and are so delicious.With those 2 books I feel confident to have people over for diner now!I definitely recommend them"
1,Book should come with a warning label,"Based on the title, I thought that this book would generally try to lighten meals up by using healthier fats, lower-fat ingredient substitues, etc - but without unrealistic, over-the-top efforts required.I was EXTREMELY disappointed to discover, after purchasing it, that it's trying to be ""low-carb"". If I had known that that's what they meant by ""healthy"", I never would have bought this book.If you, like me, are not on the ""low carb"" bandwagon, here is your warning about the true nature of the book!"
1,Not Fast or easy,"I was reeled in by the foxy Racheal and heavy marketing, I'm a novice cook- and was looking for good healthy but easy recipes with easy to find ingredients. This book had no preface - was apparently ""low carb"" butthere was nothing on the cover or title to clue you into this."
5,A must for engaged couples!,"Add this to your shopping list for engaged couples -- for bridal showers, engagement gifts, or just as a gift during the stressful planning process. You'll give them the gift of prepping for marriage, nurturing and spoiling each other, domestic bliss times, and the relationship-bonding experience of cooking together. Rachael's recipes are fantastic, easy to create, and a great gift for couples who are either experienced or beginners in the kitchen. I highly recommend this as a top pre-wedding gift, and brides and grooms should register for it as well."
4,Decent quickie,"I had never watched Rachel Ray on TV- I found the book just browsing. IT's just what it says, 30 minute meals with real food.(Except she does use canned sauces and such to save time) I have made a few of the recipes and so far, so good. Totally worth the 12 bucks I paid for the book."
3,Where are the pictures,I love Rachel Ray on TV and this what influenced my purchase of the book. I was disappointed that the majority of the recipes had no pictures. I really like knowing how the food should look.
4,good recipes,Rachel's recipes are good but as an older adult I find the choice of colors very difficult to read
1,Always scutinize your order and don't assume the Amazon search hit is correct.,"I ordered this product for my HTC-8125. It was in the list view when querying Amazon, but when I received the product it turns out it doesn't fit. I noticed (after the fact) that the model number for 8125 isn't listed in the description, but again, it was a first hit when searching. Due to the shipping costs almost equaling the product price, it wasn't worth the aggravation of shipping back to the supplier. Buyers need to completely scrutinize items when searching/ordering off of Amazon. I'd gather that customers often get stuck with useless products due to this inherent flaw when ordering; meaning items are search hits but have no applicability to the purchaser's criteria."
2,QUITE SOME EFFORT; BUT NEED SOME WORK,"John Wright and team put up a brave effort here. However, some of the statistical data they tendered are too old. Again, this is not the type of almanac to purchase if your quest for information is with a global outlook. This book brims with excellent U.S. coverage, but that is all! It gave poor coverage to most other countries. Intending almanac buyers whose interests include versatile global data should not rely on it. Look for something that touched the four corners of the world. For sure, a reputable encyclopaedia may cost more, but would be of better value than this almanac. The choice is yours!"
4,An Incredible Series,"I went into this one thinking, ""Well, I like vampire stuff but it kinda looks like a chick anime."" I'm happy to report it's much more.Sure, the main character and her companions are Japanese school girls, but this doesn't stop Miyu from battling a unique and very cool new demon each episode. And as for Miyu herself, she's a regular hottie with a cool background. Her grimk reaper inspired servant Lava just about steals the show however.Now, although I heard the next dvd's (which I plan to buy asap) were done ok, this one has all kinds of flaws. They omit the opening/closing music on 2 of the 3 episodes (although its not that great anyway). There are NO chapter breaks, just three tracks, one per episode. There are NO extras. The subtitling omits onscreen japanese words and song lyrics. But these flaws on the part of the dvd are overshadowed by suprisingly cool content. Thanks TokyoPop!"
5,Mmmmm...Shin'ichirou-sama...,"OK, I admit right off, I'm a severe Kyuuketsuki Miyu fangirl. I adore the OAVs, and initally was suspicious of the telly series, because the actors were changed. (Ok, so Shiozawa-sama died in the interim, sadly.) But. I happened to see a couple episodes in a convention film room, and I was blown away. It's still Miyu, still riveting, but there's more action, episodic plot rather than one overlying plot, and Miki Shin'ichirou. (Hmm...who's a Weiß fan?) Admittedly, it was the promise of Iwanaga Tetsuya and Yuuki Hiro that made me buy this DVD...but really, it's amazing. Not as hyper-kawaii-fast paced as some other anime, but definitely captivating. The new little shinma companion adds kawaii factor, and overall it's not as brooding as the OAV. The character designs are more shoujo now (bigger eyes, etc), and the movement is smoother. I can't wait to get the next volume!"
2,Not so interesting,"I was looking forward to this, because some japanimation is very good. But that seems to be mostly movies, I have not see any TV shows yet that I found I truly liked.And this is no exception. Beyond the titilatin of vampires and school uniforms, it really does not have much. Boring drawings, not very original concepts, and trivial story."
3,"The information is there, but ...","People who are using electronic instruments to emulate orchestras should read this book, since it has a lot of information. But be warned that the writing is inept, there are misspellings, nonstandard capitalization and punctuation, and just plain wrong words. Any editor could have fixed these problems, but the book is apparently a one-person effort."
5,What we've been looking for,Gilreath's book has been a life-saver for me. Anyone who is writing for samples and electronic/computer emulations must have this book. It is a comprehensive guide to achieving the maximum realism for orchestrations written in the MIDI environment. I'm a composer for documentaries and games and I do a ton of emulative work. Gilreath's book has helped me tremendously. I can't recommend it enough.
2,Redundant release,"I love Taj. I always travel to see his live shows and was eager for a new record. What a bummer that it is basically another disk of old stuff.Taj, if you feel the need to release old stuff, re-issue ""The Real Thing"". That is a truly great record and most of it has never been put on disk. Let folks pick up your other stuff on the disks that area currently available."
2,i have not receive,Istill have not receieve item what the holdup been almost a whole month been waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting
1,More cheesy disco rap,"Ice-T is the only good rapper on here, The rest is lameo stupid disco schlock. This is posuer rap. im talking total losers. Stupid kiddie beats make this sound like an episode of Mr Rogers"
3,what's up ?,"I've used this product with mixed results. The first time I used it, the product worked exactly as advertised. The last couple of times I've used it I can't really say that it has worked. No stamina, no more than one time."
2,More edited rap!!!,"Just like volume one in what was almost a great series, this volume doesn't include all the 12"" versions of these classics-and it even suffers from censorship. Had it included the full length, uncensored versions of Roxanne and the Real Roxanne, it would have been more than worth it. As is, it leaves you wanting something more. Track times:1. scorpio (4:52)2. it's like that (6:19)3. the roof is on fire (5:30)4. five minutes of funk (5:30)5. 8 million stories (7:55)6. a fly girl (5:37)7. can you feel it (5:56)8. basketball (5:38)9. big mouth (4:04)10. Roxanne (4:32)11. real Roxanne (4:27)12. rappin duke (4:18)13. genius rap (6:53)"
5,Nice Filter - you need a 1in wrench,"Nice filterThe gasket was nice quality, the filter feels heavy and well made. The performance reviews look good.Overall I'm happy. Just remember the 1in socket or wrench."
4,Very handy and well designed - powerful for what it is too,"I liked it - lots of plusses as I said in the title. Only thing that bugs me is how difficult it is to turn on and off, so I took off a star for that. Other than that, a well made, designed ""personal massager"""
4,Little rocket,I bought this on a lark- it was on sale from Amazon. What a great idea.. Its small shape and vibrations make it a perfect under pillow friend. Its powerful enough to get me going within 5 min. It is a bit noisy though.
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,IT WASN'T WHAT I EXPECTED IT TO BE. I'M NOT AT ALL SATISFIED WITH IT! I WOULD NEVER BUY AN ITEM LIKE THIS AGAIN UNLESS I GO TO THE STORE AND SEE IT FOR MYSELF!
1,"too HARD, what the heck.. and only one speed?? LOUD, i dont know why it had so many good reviews!!",im soooo disappointed in this product. i thought for sure it was just what i was looking for but the vibrator is HARD PLASTIC. it HURTS to use! and is extremely loud. wish i could return it!
2,Disappointed,"From the reviews I read before purchasing, I had pretty high hopes for this product. Unfortunately, it missed them ALL by a long shot. The product was a disappointment, to say the least. Doesn't do much of anything for me. Thankful it wasn't very inexpensive, or I would be very displeased."
4,Folk music,"Ila arun is a very famous folk singer in India as well as in Bollywood industry.Yhis is an album sung by Ila arun ,it has many rajasthani folk music based songs."
3,Oz Lives On!,"While there have been several comic books(series or otherwise)based on Oz, there have only a few direct graphic novels of it. Usually, a graphic novel is either a book collecting either a comic mini-series or a volume of an ongoing series, while other times it is an original print made specifically for the book. Penguin Group recently printed a manga-styled version of The Wizard Of Oz, adapted and drawn by Michael Cavallarao whose worked on DC Comics, Valiant, and Cartoon Network. Not much is different from the original story, aside from the fact it more or less has been moved to the 21st Century. Dorothy seems more like a young teenager than around ten years old, plus Tin Man is very much modeled after the Iron Giant. There's some pretty good designs and artwork in it, even though it might seem not up to specs of that fromOz: The Manga. It's a very good pick for younger readers, or for parents who want their kids to be comic nerds."
4,Pre--product review,"Although I don't have this kit myself yet, I am familiar with it and the Little Remedies line as a pharmacist; I recommend these products often and plan to use them when needed for my baby (on the way). I wanted to comment on the other reviews--Tylenol cannot be logically included in this kit because it's not a Little Remedies (by Prestige) product, it's a McNeil Pharmaceuticals product. I still feel the kit provides useful medicine for babies and toddlers, room to supplement (with Tylenol, etc.), and an easy way to keep all of the baby's medicine in one place."
2,Not worth it!,I got this as a baby shower gift and the only thing that I really have used is the gas reliever. All the other stuff my doctor doesn't know about and will recommend something else like Tylenol for pain reliever or Triaminic for cough and cold. If I were you I would just buy these things separately.
1,Save your money and buy it all separtely as needed!,"This is one of those items that is geared for new parents. It seems like a great idea but not really. I do recommend Little Remedies products as they are cheaper and just as effective but buy as you need them.At 14 months the doctor still will not allow us to give her cold medicines so it expired. We still have 3/4 of a bottle of the saline drops (cheaper if you get it at the drug store) and haven't even opened the nasal gel. I just found the teething gel after buying countless tubes of it in the last few months (put it up for use later and forgot where). The tummy drops were great! We ended up buying stock in the tummy drops we used do many!But all in all, buy as you need it and you really don't need most of this kit."
2,Not really worth it,"I received this as a shower gift and at first I thought it would be great. But when my daughter actually needed to take some of the medicine she had a bad reaction. The decongestant & cold meds. are useless, she hated the teething gel, and the gas drops made her vomit. The only thing I used was the saline drops and nasal aspirator.I would recomend buying the medicines separately on an as-needed basis in case the same thing happens to you. When I gave my daughter the gas drops by a different brand she was totally fine. I ended up just tossing the rest of the stuff after that... the thing you need most with a new baby is Tylenol."
3,check expiration dates!,I wanted to buy this for my baby but I kept finding expired ones.I finally found one that was good but my son will never get to use the toddler medicine.It will expire before he can use it.The Safety 1st clippers are much easier to hold than the ones in this kit.I do like the nasal drops and the teether.The kit does come in handy at when you can't go to the store. It would work better with someone with a toddler and a infant.
3,Good but not great!,"I got this as a shower gift and at first I loved, I believed it had everything I could need for my twins in their early days, it made me feel prepared for the unexpected. On the other hand there were some of these medications that has no use for you in the beginning like the Decongestant Nose Drops. So in my personal opinion you are better off buying only the medication you will really need! Like Tylenol or Ibuprofen, baby orajel. It will come out cheaper since meds won't go to waste."
1,dont waste your money,half the things in the package arent for infant use. the most useful thing that came in that package was the teething ring.
3,Its OK,"I didn't get a book when I bought this from ToysRus. I had it on my registry and I didn't get it. So when I went out to buy a few things I needed before the baby comes, I bought this thinking that I would have all the medicine I will need and it was easy to get everything. I need to go out and get tylenol drops, and motrin, but other than that, my kit did not have a book in it! I have already thrown out the paper package, but I will be asking the store reps about it next time I am there.I also think it would have been nice to include some syrup of isepac."
3,Haven't Had to Use It,"Thankfully, I haven't had to use the kit...so I really don't know how each item works...so it really hasn't been useful for our family."
4,Helped out in a jam,"Being a new mom, I had no idea about nasal sprays and gas drops. Someone gave this kit to me as a shower gift and boy, did it come in handy. I've only used 3 of the items so far but that's because my baby is still too young for some of the stuff. I just recommend you ask your ped before using any of it!"
4,Great starter kit for new parents.,"We have a 1-month old & have already used the ""Little Tummies"" gas relief (with a doctor's permission). This kit seems to have MOST of what a new parent would need without having to go out & buy all items seperately. It had most of the 'newborn-first-aid' kit items that were recommended in all the lists I read!Update at 7mos(July04): I would get it again if I had to do over - even though I've not used some of the medicines yet, I might eventually. Mostly you use Tylenol, Mylicon (or generic alternative), or later on baby-ibuprofin. But it was still worth it to get the kit!"
4,Good Starter Set...,"I really liked the overall concept, but I thought that the sizes of medication bottles/tubes would be larger. Also the book that was pictured to come with it ...didn't! Teething ring and nail clipper included. Good help to get you started, but by no means will it last a long time."
3,Hardly worth it so far,This kit has hardly been worth it so far. Most of the items are for children over 2 years for one thing. The gas drops came in handy a couple of times. The two things we really needed were not in the kit. Tylenol is not included in this kit and we had to run out and buy it when we brought our daughter home after her first vaccinations. It would also help if there was some kind of antibacterial oinment just incase you might clip your child's fingers while cutting their nails. The only thing that has been worth it is the saline spray for when out daughter had a stuffy nose. It helped a bit.
5,BEST GIFT EVER!!!!!,"A friend purchased this from my regstry and I am so thankful she did! Within days of being home from the hospital, I used this. It is without a doubt the BEST and MOST USED gift that I received. It is really hard to know, especially if you are a first time mom, what all you will need for a baby and with this kit you have everything that you will need and then some! Plus, the information book that comes with this kit is great. I can't wait to buy this for a shower gift for someone else! When you have a sick baby, you can't always run out to a drug store and get what you need at that very moment and it is a comfort to know that you have this kit in the house!"
3,Just so you know,"... you can use the ""2 and older"" products once your child weighs 24lbs or more. Just ask your doc. Majority of medicines have the same warning. If your child is under 2, you shouldn't be giving them medicines without discussing it with you doctor first."
1,Not worth it!,"I thought this was a great idea when I had my first baby...however, most of the cold remedy items are not recommended for babies under 2; so the only real medicines I used were Tylenol, Motrin, and Mylicon (and Target has generic Mylicon for FAR cheaper!). Don't waste your money...by the time my daughter was old enough to use the medicine, they were all expired."
3,Don't waste your money,"Some of the products in this case are good, but you can buy them individually for less money. I got this because I liked that I could keep all baby's medicines together, but the case broke apart. The nail clippers were too small for me to use, I like the ones with the large white grip to make the clippers more secure in your hand. Mine did not come with the baby book pictured here, I got advertisements and a free sample of rice ceral. Save your money and buy products that you will use!"
3,Warning: Many Items are not recommended for infants,"My husband and I thought this was a ""MUST HAVE"" when I got pregnant. Well, when push came to shove and we really needed to use a few of the things (decongestant, multi-symptom cold med)we were UNABLE to use it (not recommended for children under 2, our pediatrician told us that those items were a waste of money and that they would not recommend any parent to use aforementioned items). The most useful items within are: saline nose drops, nasal aspirator, the gas drops (little tummies)and the nail nippers. (Gas drops alone range in price from 7.99-12.99 retail). On a final note; our son cried when we tried to use the saline gel on the edges of his nostrils. We thought they were gentle like the saline drops. We were mistaken. I put some near my nostrils and it burned!Save your money..."
4,Overseas survival kit...,"I live overseas and do not trust most of the medicines we get. They either do not heal or are in unmarked clear packets. One thing you learn when living in another coutry is ""be prepared."" I like that I have these things and the gas drops are a God send. It is much cheaper than buying the items seperately and it gives a first time parent a good start, however, I am unsure when I will use many of the things. Most of my things were shipped over. I took the contents of the case in my suitcase. The plastic case was shipped in one of eight boxes. I had much more important things in the boxes and they all survived but this case broke."
1,"Some products questionable, not a good value","I have been very disappointed in this kit. I am not using many of the products - one of which I threw out because my pediatrician specifically said not to use it based on the ingredients list. Also, the plastic container is very cheap and impossible to keep together.I would skip this kit altogether and buy only the things you need and get the brands your doctor recommends (e.g., Mylicon gas drops rather than these)."
4,Peace of mind,"It's so nice to know you have ever thing you might need, even if you don't wind up using it all. Although I've used most of these products already, and my little one is only 9 months old. Plus, the handy plastic carrying case is has plenty of extra room so I can keep ALL of her health stuff in one easy to grab place, which is super nice when you're being a freaked-out Mommy with her first baby sick for the first time, so you can easily tell Daddy what to bring you, and then just sit down and look at everything and figure out what can help her."
1,Better description needed,These were legal size but nowhere in the description did it indicate that. They seemed to be of good quality but I did not want legal and had to return them. Amazon handled the return without any problem.
3,Three and a half stars because,"I loved the first 3/4's of the book. Their chemistry was right, the setting was right and the characters were well written...stereotypical yet believable. While they were stranded, it was perfect. Once they were saved, I really forgot to pick the book up everytime I put it down.Near the end of the story we were given such great dialogue as...""shut up!"" and ""your idea sucks and so does your daughter!"" Hmmm, wouldn't I love to meet a man who talks like that? All in all the book served its purpose; and that being just a light, quick read to pass the time. I will give credence to the fact that it's very early work for Ms. Brown and she no longer writes romance novels."
5,"Suspense, romance and a happy ending!",I enjoyed this Sandra Brown book because of the suspense of a plane crash and how they survived. I enjoy a nice love story that's not too complicated and that ends well.
2,Not One Of Sandra's Best,"Usually I read one of Sandra Brown's books in 1-2 days. This book, Two Alone, took me 4 days to read. It could not hold my interest enough to even pick it up. The story starts with Rusty and Cooper, who are the only survivors of a plane crash. They have to depend on each other and survive in the woods till they are rescued. The story, to me, really didn't go anywhere. I didn't even enjoy Rusty and Cooper like I felt I should since they are the main characters. Rusty was whiney throughout the book and Cooper was rude and inconsiderate most of the time. To dislike each other so much they sure fell in love awful quick. This is definetely not one of Sandra Brown's best books, I enjoy her newer novels much better."
5,Beautiful!,"Sandra Brown has written another great love story. Rich, beautiful and wonderfully ambitious Rusty Carlson and ruggedly handsome Vietname Vet Cooper Landry are the only survivors of a horrific plane crash. Determined to survive, they forge a mutually beneficial relationship that turns to love. There is everything that makes this a terrific read....romance, passion, and a good story. Read it, you will not regret it."
3,A Book That Makes Your Mind Wander,"TWO ALONE was originally written under the pseudonym of Erin St. Claire, and is a decent attempt at a romantic novel. Standard theme - plane wrecks, man and woman are the only survivors, they fall into lust on journey out of the wilderness, and then love is tested in the real world.TWO ALONE had the makings of a great book, but the story wasn't developed to that point. The characters are built-up to almost dynamic, but Brown stops before she gets them there. If you stop reading at certain key points and let your mind wander, you can fill in the blanks that Sandra Brown has left. I'm not sure if this mind wandering and dreaming was her intention, or if she fell short of her mark. TWO ALONE is not one of her best, but also not one of the worst I've read!"
3,Timeworn; but exactly what I expected and wanted to read that evening.,"This book was exactly what I expected and what I was in the mood to read. I knew what I was getting into.Have I read this before though? Trite plot: plane crash requires sexy 90210 girl to depend on rough-but-sensitive-on-the-inside hottie. Beverley Hills meets the wilderness and learns to survive. Wilderness meets society and learns to heal and love.But, I still enjoyed it. Great scenes...although very formula, but hey...what the heck! I liked them."
4,An easy afternoon read,The book is best when the main characters are stranded on the mountain. The last forty pages or so back in Los Angeles are a rather hurried race to romantic climax. The book can be easily read in one afternoon.
1,Unrealistic plane crash,"An author who is not a pilot should endeavor to find out why planes crash. This particular crash was so absurd as to turn off any interest I might have had in this book at the outset. The author presents that all the instruments fail. Instruments do not all fail at once - they are powered in different ways so that they cannot - and there is redundancy so that pilots are not completely left to the mercy of fate. ""We're going in,"" the pilot says, as though the lack of instruments causes the plane to take a nosedive. The pilot can see nothing in the clouds, but does not feel the need to gain altitude to prevent collision with terrain. Certainly, small planes can and do crash in bad weather, but the scene might have been written so that a reader with knowledge of flying would not be insulted.Two Alone"
2,I never got to the wonderful ending others enjoyed,"I have read and enjoyed a number of Jessica Hart books. I'm amazed that she comes up with so many different stories, her writing is accomplished, etc. However, for this romance, I couldn't take any more of the bickering and hostility brought on by misunderstandings while I waited for the humor and wonderful ending promised by other reviews. There are only so many mean things characters can say to each other before apologies at the end fail to make it all turn out right. Also, this arrangement of convenience was more heavy-handed than most, which didn't sit well with me either."
5,An excellent book! One of the best!,"I loved this book! It was extremely well written, admirable characters, and a wonderful plot. This is one of the best books I've ever read! I read this book three times in a row! Jessica Hart should really be commended!"
5,It was excellent!,"The synopsis didn't look too good, but this book was REALLY good!!!!!! It was funny and romantic and the characters said the right things. The characters were also people you could admire."
4,It's About Time!,This is a high quality DVD;Performance wise and technically. It's about time that these acts were released on DVD. I hope that the producers get on the stick and release several DVDs showing much more of this Classic Rock.
1,"Oh, Boy! A DVD Featuring The Worst Bands of All Time!",Jefferson Starship and Styx...two bands that did more to destroy rock 'n' roll than the plane that killed Buddy Holly and the car that killed Eddie Cochran combined!
2,headphone review,I like the sound quality of the headphones sometimes. I find that they only sound great when they are in my ears just right. I do not like the way that each of the earbuds are different lengths it makes listening with the headphones uncomfortable
2,They fall out,"The sound quality is pretty good, but that doesn't mean much if they don't stay in your ears. Very frustrating."
2,Not as comfortable as newer in ear designs,I used these for several months and had problems with them staying in my ear when I was walking. They also did a poor job of blocking outside noise.Sound quality was good for the money.I had the grey plastic speaker cover crack. It would scratch my ears afterwards so I got rid of them.They are economy priced earbuds I don't know how much can be reasonably expected. I guess I find that the newer in-ear designs where the bud goes further into the ear canal are a better bang for the buck and solve most of the problems I have mentioned here.
5,LOVE!! My PINK Sony EarBuds!!,"""LOVE the Fashion Colors""in the Sony EarBuds! They are Comfortable to Wear Even for long periods of Time The Sound is Fabulous! I use them for my Mp3 player For my AudioBooks and there Not to Expensive So if I lose them or they Break I'm Not Breaking the Bank to Replace them. Sony is a Good Brand for Electronics. So I'm Satisfied With my Purchase.Thanks! Sony and Amazon!!!"
5,GOOD EARPHONES,"I TRUSTED THE BRAND NAME AND FOUND IT PROFITABLE. THESE ARE GOOD HEADPHONES, THERE WOULD BE SEVERAL HEADPHONES FROM UNKNOWN COMPANIES WORTH 3 OR 4 BUCKS .. BUT BETTER GET ONE THAT LASTS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS... I AM QUITE HAPPY WITH THEIR SOUND QUALITY AND DURABILITY..DEFINITELY WORTH FEW EXTRA DOLLARS."
2,Fit comfortably but sound horrible,I got these on sale at Sears and was excited but then I tried them out. They fit my ears great but sound bad. They are very crackly and every time the plug moves your sound quality distorts. I would suggest something else.
1,How did this even get published?,"Utter garbage. The ""horror"" stories were not scary in the least. It seemed that the author knew he could not make anything scary, and went for jarring instead. There were quite a few moments that were surprising and/or gross, but nothing was scary.Besides the poor writing and the lack of scares, it was highly offensive in its assumption that all white people are extreme racists. I don't know if he began this book in the 30's and just got around to publishing it, or he is just trying to exploit the fear of racism. But either way, it is stupid, annoying and highly, highly offensive."
3,Fun if you're an Arnold fan,"This is a ""grade-B"" documentary, but it's still fun. You get hear old stories from lots of old Arnold friends that you've probably never seen before."
2,"Eh, all right, I guess","I'll be honest...the only reason I bought these is because I'm gradually becoming a more hardcore MotU collector. They're kinda small and expensive...and their paint jobs need to be done more carefully. Play factor is pretty low. Why? These are more like figurines to be displayed, rather than action figures...although technically they have one point of articulation in the waist. Also, they are engaged to a base, so if I was trying to act out battles, that would just annoy me...but that's my personal aesthetics. As toys, they fall short...for display, they are more like trinkets or spacefillers. Use your judgement before buying."
2,Sole is not durable,"The sole on my shoes began to deteriorate and peel off of the bottom within two weeks of light-moderate training. No street use, gym/mat training only. Very disappointing."
1,Greatly disappointed,"This book was a waste of my time, fortunately it was only 37 pages. At [item price] I could have bought 3 Star Buck Frappachinos instead."
3,The Numberz Game,"My favs: 1,3,6, 7, 10, and 11.8 and 9 are ok as well, especially after 6 and 7, and before 10 kicks it back up."
3,Durrell Lite,"I think of this book as 'Durrell Lite'. While Durrell's language is as magisterial and richly evocative as always, reading his account of a package tour of Sicily is a bit like going to hear Pavarotti sing in a small high school auditorium with poor lighting. There just isn't enough scope for his vast powers of observation within the confines of this brief, hurried tour. Instead of colorful locals, for example, Durrell gives us cranky, mostly English tourists, inconveniently falling ill in cramped hotels. If only he had gone to Sicily on his own, to spend a summer or a year, what a different book this might have been!"
5,The perfect cover for the Performer Grill,"This is a very nice grill cover! It is well worth every penny. We live in a very windy area and I wasn't going spend money on a fancy cover that would get all ripped up in the wind. I was just going to buy a small tarp and tie it around the grill as well as possible, but now I'm glad I didn't. To begin with, the cover fits the grill so well I haven't had to tie it on at all - especially since it comes down so low and covers the legs. Second, the material is very heavy duty and will stand up to the beating the wind will give it much better that the tarp would have. So far, it has stood up to a foot of snow and 50 MPH winds and come out like a champ. Well worth the money I spent. I am very pleased."
1,Great attempt,"Although the cover fits the performance grill well, there's nothing to keep it on when a breeze comes up...For INDOOR storage only... Needs to be weighted at the hem. Doesn't take much of a wind to blow it right off...The climate during grill covering season is not conducive to chasing it across the back yard!Please correct so it can stand next to your excellent grills, WEBER."
1,Fit,"Very poor fit, much to snug, have to stretch and pull to cover grill. If it had not gotten wet I would return."
2,Weber #8701 Performer Grill Cover,"This grill cover was not what I expected. I bought it to replace the one that came with the grill. The original equipment was heavy duty and covered the entire unit down to the ground. The one I bought through Amazon was lightweight, did not cover the entire unit and seems likely to blow away if it gets very windy. It's better than nothing, but not by much."
5,The Performer Grill and Cover,"This grill and cover are simply awesome. If you like cooking on charcoal and don't like the hastle of starting it, the gas starter makes this grill perfect.The cover fits easily and snuggly and both are a joy to use !"
1,Total Garbage.,"There was nothing erotic or believable about this book. She kills 2 people acts like she is crazy and then picks up her life where she left off. Are you kidding me? What she calls erotic, I call trashy. I wouldn't recommend this to Anyone!"
1,Between the covers of this book...,"lies an unrealistic, choppy, disjointed mess! Are we really to believe that a woman as educated, worldly and 'out there' as Raquel didn't know she was being played?!! I can appreciate that this is a work of fiction and every page may not be 100% believable, but this bordered on stupidity."
2,Have you ever been tricked!,I was fooled! i thoiutht this was a urban erotic tale! between my thighs is not urban even though some of it was okay. it was not a Noire book so don't waste your money.
2,Not what I hoped...,It's a page turned but not why you'd think. I kept reading hoping the story would pick up. There were alot of small stories within the story that took away from the big picture.
2,All over the place,"This book was all over the place. It jumped from one subject to the next throughout the whole book. One minute she's going in the store for a whistle then two words later she's having sex with a dude in a car. I was like WTH is going on. Nothing ever played out throughout the book and it left you wondering what was the point of mentioning certain things if the author wasn't going to go into details. This book could have been so much more. I would not recommend this book as a must read to anyone. None of the comments I read from the customer reviews were true. The only thing that was hot about this book was the sex screens and that is all....I never leave book reviews, but I was mis lead by these other comments and I felt I needed to tell my truth....From a serious book reader!!!!"
4,Good,"For a new author, this story was great. I've read other tales by well known authors and I think people are tripping because the title was marketed as an urban erotic tale which may allude it's a ""copy"" of someone else but I didn't see any plagiarism happening here. This story was nuts and if I didn't know any better, I'd think she was talking about me.Good job. Recommended."
2,Starts as a page-turner; then it's all downhill,"This book starts off really well. I wanted to learn more about Dr. Howard and was drawn in by the events. Initially, the author was good at capturing my attention. However, as the book progressed, the main character regressed. She went from a poised professional to a common street person. It's like a different author took over at some point and started writing about a totally different character. There were too many changes to be real and parts of Dr. Howard's personality were unceremoniously revealed without any context or basis for it in the book. Then, the story just ends; like the author was tired and just stopped writing. If you expect a story to build logically, this is not the book for you."
4,Hot & Steamy,I truly enjoyed reading this book. It kept me intrigued the entire time.I didn't want to put it down. The characters played their parts very well.
3,QUICK READ,QUICK READ BUT THE CHARACTERS WERE NOT DEVELOPED ENOUGH. I MEAN YOU GET TO A JUICY PART IN THE BOOK AND THE AUTHOR DOESNT EXPAND ON THE PLOT. GOOD STORY BUT VERY BASIC AND HAS SOME EX SCENES BUT NOT GREAT ONES.
2,Not bad but she tried to fake us all out,"This story is kinda good. It's really not bad at all. But why did she have to try to fake us out and make us think this was a Noire book? From the ""have you evers"" to the urban erotic tale, it is all somebody else's stuff. Naija could have done this on her own without borrowing from Noire because she is definitely not her by a long shot."
2,Why is it hating when you're telling the truth?,"I read the reviews AFTER reading this book and I lot of them I agree with. Between My Thighs was an okay read. It wasn't earthmoving but it was in no way a bad read. But the problem comes in that not only was it stated as an urban erotic tale when we all know only one author uses that tag and invented it, but it also borrowed the whole Have You Ever series right out of the other person's books! Now that is not opinion, that is fact. Just read them both and look at the publication dates to see who wrote that first. It was almost exactly taken and so obvious that it turned me off to this author. Be original. Do you."
5,Sammy at his BEST!!,"This is an awesome DVD! Not only does it include the concert in Chicago, but it also has a great interview with the Red Rocker along with wonderful scenes from Cabo! The DVD captures Sammy and The Wabs doing what they do best,putting on a fantastic show and really getting the crowd into it!It's a great preformance and it really makes you feel like you are part of the show! This is a MUST HAVE for any REDhead and Drooler!"
4,Not Enough Old Stuff...,Great show; and being from Chicago I enjoyed it all the more.The only thing missing were some of Sammy's older hits from the 70's and 80's. His newer material is pale in comparison. The show also ends on a very week song with Sammy singing alone (I do not know how to spell acapella).Regardless this is a must have view for any Sammy fan...
3,Sammy loses his edge,".... After viewing this DVD, he has lost the edge he displayed on the tours of MTM and RV. Sammy continues to be a great showman - but his choice of changing the arrangement on ""Cabo Wabo"" was a very poor decision. You can tell by the crowd's reaction they weren't pleased either. I think that is the only show I have ever seen where the crowd didn't yell,""You go there once, you be there twice."" They were stunned. The intimate feeling of being at the Cabo Wabo to start the show was what set Sammy apart from everyone else. Equally frustrating was that Sammy laughed in the worst possible time when signing ""Deeper Kinda Love"". Sammy has always been my ""fav"" - always. No opening act - no need to warm up the crowd. Because it's Sammy. The second disk with the interview was very insightful to many of the areas that Sammy has either not discussed in interviews before or touched on lightly. Too bad this DVD wasn't released on the Red Voodoo tour - that would have been magical. ...."
3,"One good DVD, but the interview is crap!!!","Sammy Hagar in Chicago is one hell of a show!!! but the other DVD is just plain crap, okay I must say it has a lot of interesting stuff: Sammy point of view on the web, Sammy's departure from Van Halen, Sammy's hobbies etc. But heck!!! I want the music!!!Strange this DVD is a cool one to get, the show is amazing, with the ""Waboritas"" a guitarist that makes us wonder if Eddie Van Halen has an afro american brother somewhere, because this guy gives the same guitar power as the famous guitar player. And of course ""Mona"" the bassist who gives a new definition to the ""girl power"" thing so overused on some ""alternative"" circuits.Sammy and The Waboritas are more popular now than Van Halen, that's for sure!!!Buy the DVD if you want a good show, but the interview is crappy, anyway if you are a fan of Sammy I think you will enjoy it anyway!!!"
2,Low budget production looks and sounds homemade!,The DTS standard *must* be lowering! I cannot believe they would put the DTS badge on this DVD. The sound is just plain bad and the video looks like it was shot with a home video camera.
5,The Real Thing,"If you like authentic cajun music, Iry LeJeune is the real thing. Goes right for the heart, but makes you move your feet as well. Too bad he died too soon."
5,A masterpiece,Who couldn't enjoy Iry Lejeune's voice and amazing accordion playing. It's so raw and emotional. This CD is a collection of his various vinyl recordings. This artist is one of the best Cajun accordionist players to play. Don't pass up this CD.
1,ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO PAY THIS PRICE!,Someone at Amazon needs a brain transplant. Who would pay this price for one folder and then add on the shipping charge?
3,It's okay,"I chose an audio version to listen to when I jog, as I've done with other study helps before. Problem is the narrator is a little monotone and I'm not always catching names/spellings as he moves through all the text with a slight accent. I need to use this to study, so I wish I had ordered the hard copy text. I'm sure it's fine for some, but it doesn't keep me engaged and I keep tuning it out."
3,English Lit study guide,I ordered this book based on other reviews. It is smaller than I had expected but does provide a summary of authors and styles. I am using this book to study for the Praxis II exam in English and Literature Content. Would like to have it be more substantial but am fairly happy with this item.
1,painkiller black edition,Game did not load. Contacted tech and was told to clean boot my system. This will eliminate some programs when you follow microsoft's clean boot directions . In order to recover these programs one has to undo the clean boot and reboot. This game is not worth the trouble. It would be nice if we were pre-warned.
4,No pain From This mostly killer game set,"I waited for this DVD Special Edition of the game + it's expansion. I think it is a great value at this price. The visuals and weapons are top notch for the run and shoot type game that this is. The enemies are very well rounded and have a scary look and feel to them. This is more of a stright forward move, shoot, find item, fight boss game than Doom 3. The story is kind of weak, but it never really interferes with the fun involved. If you like run and shoot style games, this game is fun. The fact it's on DVD is a plus. It's nothing new, but the visuals and weapons make it very enjoyable. The multiplayer is standard fare. Overall it's well worth the 30 smackers."
2,Not good on concrete,I bought these by mistake for my son.The shoes look good but do not last on concrete. The little rubber spikes wear out way too fast. Use them for what they are intended for...Turf.
3,gridirons,NOT BAD FOR THE PRICE. THEY ARE A LITTLE SNUG ON SIDES BECAUSE I WEAR A SIZE E WIDTH SHOE. NOTICED THAT SIZES DON'T COME IN WIDE. DEFINITLY NOT A WALKING SHOE. NICE STYLE THOUGH.
3,acording to me not that good!!!!!!!!,"his first album will always be number #1....second album to me is better than state of the art....long as his afu ra,im sure that he will make nice hits...try this if you want!!!...its up to you!!!!"
2,picture time,"Cute book for ESL learners. Not useful for kids that are visual learners, that need to practice spelling and looking up definitions."
4,O's fan's delight,"I'm sure most Orioles fans have checked this book out already, but if you haven't, what are you waiting for? This is a history of the O's told through interviews with many former players, managers, and executives involved with the club. Deep (500 pages) and interesting. ""The Oriole Way"" (great fundamentals, playing for the team and not for the self) worked wonders for the organization for a long time. Free agency did its bit in undermining all that, but there's always next year. One of the better baseball books on the market."
4,"No Carbuerator Dung, but pretty good!","It's verse is choppy as suey; it's opinion, biased as all hell, mean-spirited and stubborn. In short, I like it. It's what makes a music critic useful to me - he's a fan. He's not afraid to be wrong, which makes him right most of the time."
2,I waited ten years for this?!?!?,"I devoured the Consumer Guides for the '70s and '80s and had been looking forward to this for, seriously, the '90s. What a huge disappointment. Christgau's arrogance at abandoning the pithy but comprehensive reviews and understandable letter grades of the past books is his own take on a cliche he obviously became too close to--the bloated, creatively bankrupt but ever-greedy wasted rock diva. Don't indulge him."
3,A little light,"After reading Amazon's description of Christgau's latest record review guide, I was expecting a lot of bang for my buck. Instead, it's not only slimmer than either of his previous two volumes (544 pages? Mine's only 396!), it leaves out one of my favorite features of those two books: his ""Core Collection"" list. In addition, his new rating system is too confusing, as if he stole it from the Penguine Guide to Jazz. In addition to letter grades, now we have symbols representing ""bombs,"" ""turkeys,"" and ""neither,"" whatever that means. I do like one new feature: Christgau's rating of notable songs on otherwise forgettable albums. But after a 10-year wait, I wanted more."
4,Irresistible for browsing but don't take it too seriously,"I have Christgau to thank for turning me on to quite a few great records over the years. His guides are fun to read and interesting. However, he can be come off as very pompous at times and, occasionally, his writing sacrifices clarity in its struggle to impress. Ultimately, he's just a very smart guy with opinions that you'll sometimes agree with and sometimes not. If he turns you onto a few things you wouldn't have heard about otherwise, then this book is worth the purchase. And it's nice to see Freedy Johnston's ""Can You Fly"" and Iris Dement's ""My Life"" get ""A-plus"" grades. They deserve it!"
4,"Save your money, and simply visit Christgau's Web site","If you scroll through the 30-some-odd reviews for Christgau's Albums of the 90's, you'll find my original four-star review. I'm sticking to the four stars (I really think Christgau is one of the top reviewers out there), but I thought that consumers would want to know that ALL of Christgau's reviews (including the reviews published in this book) are available free on the Web site.In fact, I give the Web site five stars (ten stars) because all of his 70's and 80's reviews are also catalogued there. I made the mistake of purchasing Robert's book, but don't you do the same. Just click on over to the Web site."
3,Bleeker Bob Still Rating the Records,"Robert Christgau has been my favorite music critic since I first encountered him in the early 1970s in the Village Voice and he still dug Lesley Gore. In fact, I met him once and we discussed Gore's merits one afternoon in 1975 when I was in Manhattan. Over the years I have tried to never miss an installment of the Consumer Guide, and I still love his writing. His taste in music has moved further and further away from my own as the sheer number of CD releases has exploded, and I often either disagree with his reviews or simply have never heard of the artists he champions. Regardless of that, he is still the Dean of Rock Critics with his terse, succinct, one-paragraph-or-less reviews. I got the most pleasure from this book when he reviewed artists whose work I am familiar with, and rates several of their CDs with comments. Never less than enjoyable reading, I wish there was more discussion of the mainstream r&b, hip hop and pop I enjoy."
2,Funny curmudgeon prose marred by questionable judgment.,"Let's give the devil his due - Christgau's acerbic style of writing makes for some fun reading and his heart is in the right place - soul, rock and punk over adult easy listening? I'm with him.Sadly, the witticism loses its potency when Moby's ""Play"" gets the nod over Tom Waits' ""Bone Machine"" and R.E.M's ""Automatic For The People"" gets exactly the same grade as Kelly Osbourne's debut album.Maddening also is his inability to divorce certain artists from their efforts (I don't see why Bono doesn't get a pass despite his ""massive ego"" while Trent Reznor's pretentious posturing does). When all will be said and done, U2 will have ""With Or Without You"", ""Where The Streets Have No Name"", ""Angel of Harlem"" and ""One"" to their name while Trent Reznor will have...never mind.And in whose book is ""Let It Be"" only as good as Rancid's ""Indestructible""? Christgau's.Too bad. It's a fun read but questionable judgment mars the effort."
2,C-,"The guy is nothing if not opinionated, which is fine, but I expect a book entitled Albums of the 90s to be a lot more balanced and comprehensive. This omits essential artists and recordings (e.g. Aimee Mann) and even so is replete with what could only be called filler and throw-aways if it was on an album (and if it were an album by Sonic Youth it would get an A from this guy anyway). Well, I say it's a cynical gyp, and I say to hell with it."
1,Windbag extraordinaire,"Why does ANYONE read Christgau's reviews?? In the face of great contemporary criticism by folks like Greil Marcus or anyone at the New York Press, his mediocre insights just leave me cold. The Bangs legacy never made it to this one!"
1,Don't waste your time.,"It's comforting to know, that before art and pop culture are gone, Christgau will be gone. His intelli-prole tone of authorityrings throughout this book, giving it no useful heft at all.If you read this to aid in your music consumption endeavors, very little hope lies ahead. If you read it for entertainment/stimulation...you can't be saved anyway.F minus"
1,What a SUPERFICIAL collection!!!!,"His writing aims to be clever at the expense of informing the reader. Not only is his ""analysis"" woefully lacking in detail and description, but Christgau's taste in music is just plain awful. If you to read highly informed and passionate music criticism then read Jack Rabid, the publisher of the Big Take Over magazine."
2,A sad disappointment,"Almost everything that made Christgau's 70s and 80s reviews so great - their broad survey, their ferocious pith - is missing here. Even the beautiful simplicity of the famous letter grades is gone. Unless you're in the market for Afro-pop reviews, which take up a self-indulgently large part of this collection, this has little to recommend it."
4,"""Good, but the writers a bit iffy...",A really interesting book with some great information. The main problem is the writers begin to think that their 'opinion' of the show really matters. The factual stuff is great but when their opinion of some of the seasons begins to cloud the judgement of some of these facts it becomes a problem- example being their description of why some seasons rated beter than others. Despite this it is better than a lot of DW related stuff. Long live the 5th Doctor!
5,This on great arcade style racing game,This game is really great compared to other racing games except for GT which is the best but enough bout that VP has alot af cars to choose from and has various modes that ranges from tournament to stunts. Also the graphics are good for a PS game and theres no scenery pop-up like driver2 or slowdown. I strongly recommend purchasing this game.
2,Wannabe Gran Turismo,"I don't really like GT either but at least that game wasnt COMPLETELEY ridiculous. This is one of those games that fill the text on the back with great vehicles and you turn the game on to find out that three are unlocked. (Actually, in the case of this game there are two) Also, the cars handle like wet marbles and you get spun out frequently by other racers while they are untouchable."
2,"happily ""vanished"" from my collection","i dont make any money winning driving games, but i would consider myself a pro. i have all the ""super licenses"" on Gt3/ ps2, and pride myself on beating other race games. so i kept ""vanishing point"" in my collection and would return to it to give it another shot every now and then to see why i havent played it in so long. it didnt take long to figure it out. the only thing enjoyable about this game is the ""stuntman"" challenge section, other than that this game will make you so frustrated you will break controllers and mabey more. the graphics are fine but, i couldnt get anywhere, even after hours of dedication. RENT BEFORE YOU BUY!!! i finally traded out this waste of disk space for ""V-Rally 2"", and now i enjoy myself again. p.s.: anything that says NFS on it will make you smile!"
5,Witty and whimsical delegation of everything kids hate,"What a delight! Walter introduces us to Last Place Larry, who obligingly loses at all games and competitions, the Laughers who think all his jokes are funny, the Thing-Finder, the Homework Helper, and all the rest of his staff, who perform unpleasant tasks and provide support in every aspect of his life. Children will adore the deliciously subversive idea of a staff to take all of the imperfections out of life, and will love coming up with their own ideas for additional staff positions. The witty pictures by New Yorker artist Roz Chast perfectly match the understated humor of the text by author Patty Marx. Their staff of Laughers will include anyone who picks up the book. Highly recommended!"
3,Gilbert O'Sullivan,Gilbert O'Sullivan is a very good song writer. His music touches most everyone including the greatartists.The price tag for this abum is outrageous. I had to save up just to buy it. If It were not for my gal Imay of passed on this album because of the price.
3,Amazon's Song List is Wrong for this CD!,"Good CD, but Iv'e been looking for a copy of ""Christmas Song"", and Amazon's listing for song#17 is wrong as well a some of the other song numbers!"
4,"All the singles, plus What's In A Kiss","Collectors rejoice! This CD, unlike some compilations, includes all of O'Sullivan's Top 40 charted songs. The bonus is getting ""What's In A Kiss"", released by Arista (if memory serves) in the early 80's. Another one of those songs that coulda, woulda, shoulda been bigger."
4,Missing an Essential Song,"Great compilation, but it is missing ""We Will,"" one of O'Sullivan's most hauntingly beautiful songs."
3,"Wonderful, but...","Tony Bennett is like a fine wine that only improves with age. At 80, his voice is perhaps better than it's ever been. The material on this DVD from his DUETS album is impeccable and each one of his guests (with the possible exception of Stevie Wonder, who destroys ""For Once in My Life"") brings charm and style to the table. I would give this DVD full marks except for one extremely annoying thing: the ""Tony Bennett is wonderful"" interviews are slotted in DURING songs! Come one, guys: let us see and hear a full take of a song. Do the interviews after the songs or in a group at the end of the DVD. Don't interrupt the song for them. Even PORTRAIT OF AN ALBUM, the no-longer-available DVD of the making of Sinatra's L. A. IS MY LADY album, had full takes. (Perhaps on this album Tony and company never got through a full take?) I'm delighted to have seen Tony perform on this DVD. He's a marvel. But the producers of the DVD should be shot!"
3,Tony Bennett - Duets First Edition,"The Second edition Tony Beeett Duets is better than first . I only bought this edition , thinking that was so good, but was a frustaction for me."
4,it's a beauty,"Nice music in a wonderful atmosphere.Nice guests and a excellent host.A host, who only stimulate his guests, while he remains in the background for himself.That's mostly unusual!"
2,don't like this taste,"Other flavor mints are fine but these leave me with a not-so-good taste afterwards. They do the job of getting the saliva flowing, but go for another flavor."
5,"Truly refreshing, cavity preventive, and long-lasting breath mints","This jar of 240 small mints packs a powerful punch against tooth decay, bad breath, and dry mouth. The mints [there are several available flavors, but there is not a jar containing an assortment of all flavors] contain xylitol, a fluoride-like ingredient that coats the surface of each tooth teeth to prevent cavities (i.e., dental caries). No matter which flavor you buy, each Spry mint lasts relatively long [much like a piece of hard candy] and is incredibly pleasing to the taste (while delivering a light (and safe) fluoride treatment to the teeth). One's favorite flavor depends upon the individual palate: I prefer the Berryblast flavor; yet, the Lemon flavor--although more subtle but less rich--is nearly as satisfying."
1,Wrong Amazon Barcode Label,"Ordered the Xlear Spry Berryblast mints. Unfortunately, Amazon had their barcode label placed on the Power Peppermints. The one star is really for the mislabeling Amazon made. As for the wrong item sent, the Power Peppermints is pretty good. Very minty."
4,Berryblast should be Berryhint!,"These are basically little hard shelled candies with a hint of a berry flavoring. They are a little smaller larger than regular M&M;'s.With the hard pink covered shell, they don't leave any powder residue and so are convenient in that way.I didn't experience them as particularly sweet or interestingly sour so some may like that feature but I find I am gobbling them down in search of some kind of flavor burst.I prefer the Xlitol Cinnamon MintsEpic Dental 100% Xylitol Sweetened Mints, Cinnamon, 60 Count (Pack of 5). They really give you a zinger of a flavor blast and are sweet tasting...I am satisfied with one or two or three at a time instead of being unsatisfied with the Spry Berryblasts after sucking on way more than 3.For portability, I used the little empty tins from the Epic Dental Mints and filled them with the Spry. The plastic bottle Spry comes in is not portable (unless you maybe want to use it as a shaker or rattle on stage...ha,ha,ha)"
5,Non-minty mints,"I know when I hear the word ""mint"" I have expectations of mint flavour so I didn't know what to expect from these. There is NO mint flavour, only raspberry flavour. They're delicious!"
3,Taste Good but Made in China!,"My dentist told me to get these mints to stop tooth decay. They taste great and I would have no problem EXCEPT that they are made in China. I didn't know that when I ordered them. After reading about the poisonous toothpaste, lead based toys and deadly dog food, I do not trust pharmaceuticals or other edibles compounded in China."
3,tastes great but makes me painfully bloated,"Got these for the dental benefits, I both love this lflavour and the lemon ones. However they make me very bloated. I will try to build up to more a day, but if it keeps being like this, I sadly can't take them anymore.Will probably depend on how sensitive you are, so be careful, start with just a few and build up..."
5,"A Great Candy Substitute to Reduce the ""Bad"" oral Bacteria","This is a great candy substitute because it utilizes Xylitol, a sugar-alcohol that has no carbohydrate action. Oral bacteria ingest the Xylitol and cannot metabolize it, thus starving the bacteria. With daily consistant use, Xylitol greatly reduces the harmful cavity-causing bacteria in one's mouth.Xylitol is also available in several other forms:Spry Peppermint Xylitol Chewing Gum 600 Count, Xlear - Spry Toothpaste Flouride Free, 4 oz toothpaste,Xlear - Spry Oral Rinse, 16 fl oz.konedog"
5,John O'Donohue Lives on in this DVD,"Whether or not you have read any of John O'Donohue's wonderful, inspiring books, you will enjoy this DVD that enables you to walk with him through beautiful Irish landscapes and hear his warm voice as he talks of friendship, spirit, nature, God, and blessing. The DVD is very inspirational."
3,Mikasa Italian Countryside Footed Bowl,"It's pretty, but not as pretty as the dishes - the dishes just look like a more expensive product. Would look nice with fruit."
3,Not The Best Quality,"I bought this for a friend and was there when she opened it. The color is cream and it looks nice, but it's not very heavy, as I expected. It's so thin that it's not smooth inside, you can actually see the ridges inside the bowl at the bottom. I expected better quality."
2,Deeply Disapointed...New York State of Mind Missing...,"Yes, this CD has several great tracks such as The Ghetto & The City, etc. But imagine my disapointment when I found that the very best song/medly on the original release of The Best Of Mark Almond...was missing. That would be the medley New York State of Mind/Return to the City. This medley was worth the price of the CD. So I have to give it only 2 stars for stupidity in the compilation of the re-release."
3,Good Reference Book,"This is one of a series of books on bridge by William Root, an outstanding authority on the game of bridge. I would not limit my study to his books alone. I think it is good, but Audrey Grant's series on bridge are better. Nevertheless, it is still a good reference book."
2,Not the book I was looking for,"First off, I am a Christian who loves the Harry Potter books. I've been searching for other information to defend these books from other Christians who haven't actually read the books for themselves and are just shooting off comments about the worst parts of the books. Looking for God in Harry Potter brings up extremely obscure names and reasons for names in Rowling's books and most of it is at the very least an extreme stretch. E.g. John Granger mentions that Harry's surname Potter is because of the fact that God is referred to as a potter by Paul. This book was not useful for my purposes and in my opinion just a work of fiction."
3,Kind of Sad,"This is a book written by a Christian fundamentalist for other Christian fundamentalists. If you live in the world of ""am I saved?"" and want to know if it's ""OK"" to read Harry Potter books, then this book might be for you. On the other hand, if you can think for yourself, and don't subscribe to a sadistic god of heaven/hell, all-or-nothing, just one true religion, you won't see the point of this book.The author makes some valid points about the richness of J. K. Rowling's worlds, etc., to let us all know ""it's OK""."
3,More people should be this vested in the study of literature,"I love reading books like this. I like to see someone who is educated, take a subject that has been reviled and judged without thought or detailed consideration, and bring its true colors into the light. A work of literature is an expression of the soul brought on by tons of experiences. And harry potter is an incredibly diverse, remarkable society to only exist in a book. Harry Potter can be many different things to many different people. It has the power to relate to the many minds, including the christian mind, which john granger decently argues. I would also recommend listening to ancient faith radios broadcasts on the subject of harry potter-it is very interesting for fellow christians looking to receive some insight."
3,Looking for God in Harry Potter,"The book makes some good allusions to the Holy Bible, but some of the points are a bit stretched. If you are looking for good things in the Harry Potter series to tell people, then you will find many of them. For the rest of us looking for a good work relating God and Harry Potter, it will not be found here. The book is poorly written, and the way the ideas are covered reminds me of a friends lecture notes, (you get the idea, but nothing flows and it is quite boring at times). The book does have some good references in it, but it is more informative than entertaining."
2,Unrealized potential,"This CD is a remastered edition of the original 1983 album by a short-lived band. Cobra, which released only one album before breaking up, actually contained some talented musicians. Vocalist Jimi Jamison went on to work with Survivor, while guitarist Mandy Meyer had played with Krokus and would go on to work with Asia. Unfortunately, the potential was largely unrealized here. The outcome is competent, but rather non-descript hard rock. There is nothing bad, but nothing really outstanding either. Also, the price is a bit stiff for a CD that runs 38 minutes."
3,First Strike CD,"CD is great, getting it was a little bit of an problem. Ordered on Dec. 19th and did not receive it until Jan. 14th. Did not diclose that is was coming from UK. Might have made a different decision on placing order."
1,This movie sucks,This movie suck it does not even have DMX in the movie like they make him out to be he is in the movie for maybe a total of 2 mins. but overal it is not worth getting
2,no story,"I never really got the story. This movie just has alot of shootings and people getting killed and it seemed like the police force had no control. At the end the message was about New Orleans high crime rate and poverty. So I assume this is what the movie was about. There was no real story. This could have been a good movie if some more thought was put into it. Shame on the director and writers. They have a couple of good actors in there too. To me the movie was just all over the place, (this was worst than a soap opera. DMX was the narrator, he was not an actor in this movie and you only see him talking a couple of times throughout the movie. It is like one of the reviewers said, almost like a home movie. The only thing I learned about this movie was at the end when the message pops up about New Orlean high crime rate and high proverty. Other than that you are not missing much."
3,"""It could have been better""","It was slow going without too much of a storyline,a few good actors who could have done better in a really good movie.Sadly I was not impress with this movie"
1,HOME MOVIE???,"I WANT MY MONEY BACK. I paid a dollar to hire this and its not cool at all. This couldn't pass as a soap! The acting is so bad you can see the characters trying to remember their lines with blank expression on their faces. Its fun spotting the camera crew in the reflections though. Especially the sound guy. I think porn has a better plot than this. The only natural dialogue appears when characters say 'motherf***er"" which is quite convincing and very natural until more challenging non-slang is scripted. How LDP and DMX pit their names to this is beyond me. Its not like they are that good anyway but this flick is suicide!"
3,Great toy- Wished the kids liked it.,"Neither my girls: 8 year old or my 2 year old, have ever really played with this much. Guess it's not their cup of tea. sad. it's a pretty cool concept."
5,Great anime!,"I waited sooo long to see this anime! Fansubs were hard to find and there were no Hong Kong imports done, so this is it! It's more serious than Sailor Moon and more ""grown-up"" than Cardcaptor Sakura(which is TERRIBLY, painfully English dubbed), but not as developed as Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne, which it is similar in plot to. Of course, there is a small mascot: Ruby the hedgehog, but she doesn't talk. Definitly pick this up, and if you enjoy it, e-mail the company and bug them to bring over KKJeanne and Corrector Yui."
3,Subs vs Dubs...,"At first I really liked it...The subbed episodes were good. It would have been nice if the opening and ending themes where subbed as well...then I watched the dub. It was dubbing at it's worst. Not only were the voices quite horrible, but the script was almost completely different from the sub. It was as if the people who dubbed the first season of Sailor Moon had gotten their hands on another really good anime. I was absolutly horrified..."
5,Saint Tail! the master thief that staels Asuka Jr.'s heart,"I've read and watched Saint Tail, i like reading it better as you can use your imagination more but hte episodes are really good too. Saint Tail is about a girl named Meimi Haneoka and her friend Seria who is a nun-in-training. During the day Meimi is a regular school girl that goes to Saint paulia academy, But by night she turns into the mysterious thief Saint Tail! but she just isn't any thief, she steals back items that were unjustly taken from their owners, Her friend Seria listend to peoples confessionals and tells Saint Tail what to steal and where. Saint Tail is pursued by a boy in her class named Asuka Jr.(who she likes) he wants to be a detective and is the son of a famous detective. Asuka Jr. challenges her and Saint Tail accepts, She then leaves clues for Askua about her next heist. want more? E-mail me!"
3,it's okay,"the story is cute but it seemed like a very simple plot. girl hears people's problems, tells friend, friend turns into a super hero and helps those people. the english voice acting isn't bad, a lot better than other stuff i've heard (like ccs). overall, i'd say a 3."
4,Very comfortable shirt.,"I like this t-shirt very much because it is comfortable and not too extravagant. I like to wear shirts that have a minimal amount of designs. I specifically like the name of the team and the logo, that's all. The shirt is a one-size fits all. I am a big guy to begin with and this shirt is large on me."
2,Buy a book about composition instead.,"I received this software few days a go and it is not what I though it would be. There is no video, audio or even a place to type. Basically it is a multimedia file with text instructions. I wouldn't waste my money although it doesn't cost much. I find it useless."
2,Scent is overwhelming,"The scent is overwhelming. Smells like an Avon product. It actually makes my eyes burn when I just apply to my hands. And the skin on my hands now feels irritated, much like when I touch dryer sheets or strong detergents. Not good! I don't know if the ingredient list really lists everything in this product, as I've never had a reaction to any of the recognizable ingredients before, and I've used most of the ingredients listed in their pure/straight form on my skin at one time or anotherThis stuff is probably not good for people sensitive to smells. Even if it didn't irritate my skin I'd be unable to use it due to the strong perfume.:( Ugh. I'll stick to straight macadamia nut oil and pure shea butter from now on. I wonder why I tried something new when I already have something that works great."
5,Great lotion for eczema,"5 star for quality of product and really fast delivery. Lotion leaves skin smelling good, and it keeps skin soft and unirritated.. i have eczema, and this really feels nice. I have gotten compliments already on its scent. Also, I use it with Aveeno daily moisturizer to keep the dryer spots from drying out fast.Great overall; however, the bottle has to be left sideways or upside down because it is hard to squeeze out the lotion's thick consistency. I would suggest a squirt top. Thank you!"
2,Why change a good thing?,"I usually purchase this item locally but the price has increased about 50% and was quite happy to find that amazon sold this item and for less!! I quickly purchased a couple of bottles to tie me over for a few months in addition to the newly purchased bottle. As soon as I used it I noticed something was different and when I checked the ingredients I noticed they changed them!! The consistency which used to be thick is so much thinner. Also, the wonderful smell is nonexistent. I instantly cancelled my order on Amazon (hopefully it goes through) but I had to write a review to let others who may come to the site looking to purchase this item for less. If you can luck up and find one of the ""older"" bottles (which based on the picture it is not) then that's great but I was not willing to take that chance. Some people may be ok with the change (why I gave it a 2) but if the two complaints I listed is why you liked the lotion, don't BUY!"
2,Unsatisfied Purchaser,"The radio works well, especially because the tuner is digital. Switching from stored memory station is a bit complex. Overall, the radio is complicated to use, and the instructions are not very clear. The most troubling part of this device is that the radio alarm only goes off for about 5 minutes (I have not figured out anyway to lengthen the alarm time), and unless I have it on loud, I sleep through the alarm. My advise is that if you can afford to, buy a better Alarm Clock."
1,Clock does not work,"What good is a clock radio that does not keep time. This piece of junk was recieved on Friday and sent back on Monday. During the weekend, I set the time three times and within 5 to 6 hours the clock reverted to the initial setting, and the radio presets were also lost."
3,Jensen Digital CLock Radio,Jensen is normally one of the best electronics companies you can find. I don't know what they were thinking when they designed this one. It is the most difficult radio I have ever had the displeasure of trying to figure out. They should have stuck with the tried and true system they use on their car radios.
3,Not what I was hoping for,"I was excited when I saw this item as it was what I was looking for in a raido. It looked good and I liked the fact that it had present radio stations. I wanted a small radio for my kitchen to listen to music, NPR and sports. For me, the sound isn't as important as the reception. I was disppointed in the reception. It didn't pickp-up several small local FM stations even though I had the correct number dialed in. Otherwise it did sound fine for the stations that it did receive and my wife like the look of it. I'm taking it back and plan to spend more money to purchase a radio with better reception. It's good for $25, but I was disappionted."
4,cool,I think this game is really cool because all the new graphics and new teams and plays.It's really cool because it has the arizona dimondbacks team and they are the world series champions i think this is a relly good game.
4,Best Baseball Video Game Ive Played since Baseball Stars,"Im not a big fan of Baseball, or Baseball video games. Occasionally, however, I find one that is worth playing. This is a great baseball game. It has everything from Sammy Sosa's constant grin to Junior's famous swing to the new ball parks (and the field of dreams!). It is not too hard to hit or pitch, a problem I have found with some other games. The only dificuty I have found in the short time Ive been playing this is that the baserunning can be a bit tricky. But over all, I give it high marks."
2,OK gameplay... terribly easy competition,"I would like to start out that even though I gave ASB 2001 only 2 stars, it is a decent game. It's the kind of game that you sit down and belt out a few hard earned homers and then quit. I didn't like how hard home runs are to hit in the home run derby. You hit the ball and it just goes.... no sounds, no commentary, only the repitiveness of the dull crowd. In Triple Play, you hit a home run and you know it. The crowd knows it also and you get the warm fuzzies all over. As for the competition, it was incredibly easy. I think i lost one time when i was the minnesota twins playing against the cooperstown legends. Nolan ryan smoked my batters, but they only won by a 7th inning Mr. October homer that barely cleared the left field fence. Besides that, it's an OK game to play against your friends for a bit. Right before a game of Perfect Dark!!!"
1,The worst sports game ever!,"When I first bought this game I was realy excited. I already own ASB 2000 and think it is a good game.But when I opened this one-terrible! The announcers get boring by 2 outs in the top of the first! The only thing I like about this piece of junk is that the game play is good, but not fantastic. In short, this game could not be worse if Acclaim even tried. ...."
3,Somewhat Useful,"This might be somewhat useful for someone wanting to know what an expert witness is and what he does. However, for an actual (potential) expert witness, it is rather weak. The advice is all good, but too generic to be very useful. It is a very short book, which makes it an extremely quick read. I would recommend ""The Expert Witness Handbook"" instead (which is on my bookshelf)."
5,A trip worth taking!,"""The Wings of Time"" is a most interesting look at the culture and history of ancient Greece through the eyes of three men from the 21st Century who have traveled back in time. Because the trip was planned in advance, the men arrive with a knowledge of the language and important historical events about to unfold around them. Like the movie of ""The Titanic"", the reader is able to experience actual events, including meeting Socrates and the great Persian King Xerxes, through the eyes of amiable fictional characters; a very entertaining way to gain some historical insights! The book ends with a most likely opening for a sequel...hopefully Mr. Marmar will ""write on""!"
4,a terrific read,"This is an exciting blend of science fiction, fantasy, ancient history, a good study of customs and passions of a bygone age that begs comparison with our own values in modern times.Once picked up the book is hard to put down. If you can say that about any book it's time you read it.The characters are a neat blend of modern attitudes with a newly found respect for ancient society. Any one who enjoys TV's ""The X Files"", adventure stories, mystery and intrigue, and fantasy should find this a great read.I recommend it. Just Read It."
5,Take the step away from MTV rap,"THIS MAKES NO SENSEComing out of Cali's Quannum label (along with DJ Shadow, and Blackalicious), Latyrx will explode your brain with the energetic and deadly accurate flows of Lateef and Lyrics Born. This album will hold the interest of the real hip-hop heads, and it is also a good first album to try to get away from the big-name, uncreative rap music that has invaded our TV's and radios. Lateef the Truth Teller consistently holds the listeners interest with his all over the board rhymes and vocal undulations. Anyone who has seen him live knows that just when you think he can't get any more hyper, he just goes wild. Buy this for some hip-hop that will make you smile."
2,"I lost interest in it, towards the end.","I really wish that I could agree with the very positive reviews, but after reading mostof the book, I just lost interest in the characters and in the story. I liked it at the beginning,and Ira Wood obviously is an intelligent writer with interesting and humorous observations.And chapter 17 in the book is very funny - a dinner with the family. After reading most of the book,though, I just lost interest in the characters and in the story. So I read the last 30 pages of thebook, just to see how it ended."
4,Great detective.,"I loved the old TV series, and Erle Stanley Gardner wrote the book- literally. If you ever likes Perry Mason you're sure to like this book."
2,Great looking...but not working!,"Got this because the dial was easy to read, but after a few days, it quit working. jeweler said the battery was good, but something mechanical was wrong with it. Sent it back and still waiting for a refund. I'll stick with Citizen and an Eco-Drive. Invicta, where is your quality?"
2,Does not work so great with optical mice,"Love the mouse pad, it's beautiful and feels great. But, the globe pattern freaks out my optical mouse. If I actually rated the pad a little more granularly:Look: 5 starsQuality: 4 starsFeel: 4 starsMouse tracking: 3 stars (more resistance feels more like velvet)Mouse function: 0 stars, my optical mouse does not work.I'm sure the other patterns will be better, just be wary of the globe as the lines cause issues.Garry"
2,not suitable for serious game programming,"The reviewer Pierce is spot on. The book has little to distinguish it from other books already out on MIDP 2. Much of the text concerns low level and simple material. Basically walking through the classes that are in MIDP and explaining how to use them.But in a very elementary manner.I guess the value of this book depends on your background. If you have never used MIDP [any version], then it does have some merit. You will certainly learn how to craft basic graphics and a user interface. But if you have already used MIDP and want an advanced guide, that will actually help you code a sophisticated game, then look elsewhere."
5,Looking for a grill cover for your George Forman!!,"Well, look no further. My apartment complex doesn't allow any type of charcol or gas grills but electric is allowed. I was going crazy trying to find one that would fit my George Forman Kettle Grill - I didn't want to lug it in and out all summer. So, I took a gamble and ordered this grill cover and it fits perfectly! I can now leave my George Forman Kettle Grill on my deck and not have to worry about the elements!"
3,Did not fit our 18 inch grill,We could not get this to go over our 18 1/2 inch Weber grill. Our grill has a handle so maybe that is why. We returned this and got the 22 inch cover which works fine. Seems to be well made and durable.
3,Very good quality,"A little bit pricey, perhaps, but it fits well, looks good and is sturdy enough to easily stand up to the elements. Sort of like an L. L. Bean product for yer compact Weber."
5,Weber quality,"Weber quality strikes again!!I needed a cover for this older style Weber grill. The quality of this grill and exact fit is exceptional. And, for a reasonable price! Good job Weber!"
1,Not For You If You Live In Florida.,"This item lasted about a year and then the sun got to it. If you just want it to keep the dust away and will be stored away from the sun, it might be okay. Mine sat in the sun on the patio and and the ultraviolet rays just dried it up to no end. I certainly would not recommend this product to anyone."
5,an excellent book for premed students,"For someone who is initially exposed to anatomy and physiology (even basic histology and embryology!), it's quite readable and understable. It even makes this complicated subject much fun. Colorful graphics and diagrams help describe concepts and processes more precisely and interestingly. You'll love physiology after reading it. ""No, I don't think so"" will probably be your answer when your classmates comment that physiology is too hard and dull. Fairly economical purchase of a combined anatomy and physiology text."
3,Disappointing,"Having been to Florence several times over the past few years and gained an appreciation of Donatello's work (especially his wonderful statue of Mary Magdalene), I was looking forward to viewing this DVD. Unfortunately, it proved disappointing. The photography is subpar (partially because many of the statues carried the accumulated grime of centuries, but also due to unimaginative framing), the commentary pedestrian.Donatello was one of the geniuses of the Renaissance; he deserves better than this."
3,Long Vs. Short Covers,"I prefer the long weber grill cover for winter protection but in the summer i prefer the short cover. The Weber 9856 Genesis Silver B Grill Cover is a great short cover. Although it blows away in high winds, it is much easy to remove from the grill when it is being used a lot."
5,Kid's love it!,This is a fun filled book that the kids really like. They enjoy the rhyming nature of the book and can really identify with the characters.
4,ECW Anarchy Rulz,"WOW!!! what a great game. I loved this game a lot. Much better thatn any other ECW game ever made. Has many great ECW start who I will name later. There are many matches including a barbed wire match, cange,ladder. Its just EC F'N W. Great hardcore action.SUPERSTARS:Tommy DreamerSandmanRob Van DamDudley BoysSabuTazMike AwsomeRey Mysterio JrEddie GuerreroNew JackBalls MahonyAxl RottenSuper CrazyLance StormLionheart(Chris Jericho)PsicosisRhinoChris BeniotMasato TanakaPlus Many More"
1,What has Acclaim done???,This is one of the worst wrestling games ever made for PSX. It's worse than the first one. The only thing I like about it is that there are more wrestlers to choose from.
4,A awesome great game for the ecw and wrestling fan.,"Very good game.It is similiar to WWF Attitude but with some more type of matches and modes.Every ecw star,from sandman to RobVanDam.If you have played WWF attitude you can see same graphics,engine and the create a wrestler which is likely large.If you love acclaim wrestling games buy this one or rent it before buying it.Thanks guys!!!!!!!!"
5,ECW,ECW ANARCHY RULZ is a cccccooooolllllll game it has a lot of characters it has a lot of matches so get this game NOW!!
1,DON'T BUY THIS GAME!,This game stinksIcan'teven do a grapple Move and when I Do It is Stupid.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT IS VERY HARD AND IT IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!
3,real review,Im gonna tell the truth this game is not good but its not bad but the best wrestling game by acclaim thebest match is the deathmatch. e-mail DA__DON@webtv.net to here more.
3,"NIce looking, functional - but hard to assemble","The swivel bar stool is very attractive and a very good value. We have put together other pieces of furniture (kitchen islands, etc.) but this was one of the more difficult as the legs were a very tight fit)."
4,great for photos,"Printshop 20.The cartoon-graphic stuff they provide reminds me of ""wacky plaques""that Mad Magazine(?) use to put out-decades ago!However,I found that using it for photos is really nice.Just import from the drop down, adjust your parameters-crop,resize,adjust color,contrast,fix blemishes, etc.and then I choose ""export as"" from File drop down and save as a jpeg anywhere I want.I really like it, because in that respect, it's very user friendly once you know how to do it.I've made several cards with it, and all I can say about that is you better have your own photos or graphics to choose from, as I find the ones provided as 1,000 of the same thing."
5,LATEST PURCHASE FROM AMAZON,"Purchasing from AMAZON is becoming exremely easy. This CD Arrived so safely packed, and in the shortest of time (just over one week). I live in New Zealand, ""down under"" in the Southern Hemisphere, and a VERY LONG WAY from U.S.A. This is VERY EFFICIENT service indeed.The Broderbund product, PRINT SHOP is well produced, and offers so many options. It takes a little time to master, but promises to fulfil my requirements.Broderbund Print Shop 21 DeluxeBroderbund Print Shop 21 Deluxe"
5,Good,It is perfect for what it is intended. I would recommend it for a variety of uses. Give it a try
4,my fault,"The book was not as pristine as I expected from one rated 'good', but as I later discovered, that was my fault, as I wasn't aware of the norms for the ratings. On the whole, I would give this vendor three stars out of four."
5,A great introduction to Isaac Asimov,"This was the first book of Asimov's that I read, and I think it give you a good grasp of what the late great writer's thought was like. You have some of the best short stories included, especially ""Nightfall"", one of the all-time SF classics, and some enduring favorites of mine, such as ""Belief"" (which asks what happens when a physicists finds out he can fly)and ""Breeds There a Man?"" (a rather unsettling tale about mankind's origins and future).Asimov is at his best form with the short story (the famous Foundation Trilogy began as short stories), and these are the pick of the litter. I'm not sure how many people are aware of Asimov's interests in science history, and he has many delightful essays giving one a window into some of the lesser-known characters in scientific history, and some of Asimov's thoughts on the role of science. Of particular note is also his thesis that technology made slavery obsolete."
4,Wonderfull!,"A year or so into my Nitty Gritty record cleaning machine revitalization of my long neglected lp collection , I rediscovered this gem. It really is one of the most overlooked lps in the Kinks Kataloge. I'm embarrassed to say I hadn't listened to this in forever and a day. Call meself a Kinks fan.....It really is one of the last great Kinks lps. $$$ well spent then and now."
3,a die hard Kinks fan finds little to cheer about,"This album was the last good effort from the Kinks and was definitely the beginning of the end for the band. Although Do It Again and Livin' On A Thin Line were both great songss there is little else worthy of more than a cursory listening. I am a die hard Kinks fan. I saw them on the Word Of Mouth tour and a couple tours after it. Get this one at auction or a used cd, spend the money on Give the People What They Want and the live One From The Road for the best of the Kinks from this era.GOD SAVE THE KINKS"
5,Finally on CD!!!!!!!!!!,"I have been waiting forever for this CD to come out (I've nearly worn out the LP!!) Includes great classics like ""Do it Again"" and ""Living on a Thin Line"". Though ""Sold Me Out"" is my favorite, a great rockin' track, this album contains some awesome softer moments, such as ""Missing Persons"". FANTASTIC!!!"
3,One of Daves moments.,"If there was a rivality between the Daviesbrothers this album was the moment when kidbrother put bigbrother in place. The only classic Kinkssongs here are Daves ""Guilty"" and ""Living on a thin line"". One great rocker and one delicious rockballad. Rays songs are for the most okey but for once he missed out on the genius (but the TV-studio livetake from 84 ((You Tube)) of the titlesong is tight, exuberant and brilliant). The rate is a STRONG 3."
4,BS,"Whoever wrote that review above is a retard. First off, Maestro is NOT Latino... He's from Canada(Toronto), not LA... But the album is good, not great..."
2,Not worth the money,My son received this you when he turned 5 and he is almost 7 and has only used it to hear the woman's voice announce the time. It is difficult to figure out how it works even after reading and re-reading the directions. The buttons are not clearly labeled and the volume button does little to change the sound level. It not even mildly entertaining.
1,buy a better clock,"the first one arrived broken with no instructions. the replacement (easy process) worked.... as well as it was meant to. the time can only be manipulated in increments of 5 (3:00, 3:05, 3:10 and so on).that confused the kid. it also does not always repeat the correct time that the clock hands are placed on. i could go on, but why bother. it does not tell time. enough said."
5,top notch,Top notch with most all of Hooker's distinctive beat hits. Sound quality is very good. Would recommend very highly to any blues fans.
1,"Er, have a good look around first before you purchase","There's an online download available titled ""John Lee Hooker 100 Blues Classics"" which is very, very inexpensive. I haven't seen a collection that could be better for the price and the recordings are crisp.This paragraph has been added since I noticed H McFadden was not happy with my review. Ok. I'll talk slower then. iTunes has a download called ""John Lee Hooker - 100 Blues Classics"". There - I said the i word. Didn't want to, as I am a regular Amazon customer and I don't like to mention either site on either site.When I read a review and someone mentions (probably a little generally) that there is something better out there (in their opinion), I go looking for it - and not just on Amazon. OK? My email is available on my profile. If you have question regarding a review of mine, please don't hesitate to email me for clarification etc. I respond a lot better to that than if I have some numpty trying to get on my case."
4,I'm teachin' the blues to this cat.,"This is a solid collection of songs by John Lee Hooker, spanning most of his long career. It doesn't have every important track by him, but it's the best that's available."
5,An Awesome Mystery Novel!,"The Bishop and the Beggar Girl of St. Germain is a very exciting mystery novel. I'm relatively new to mystery novels, but this one was quite an interesting trip. A priest is missing in Paris, and Bishop Blackie Ryan is on a mission to rescue him. The missing priest is the most popular priest in all of France beacuse he is a television star and a hero throughout the nation of France. But his integrity is seriously doubted by the church. Blackie gets help from a hilariously sardonic Cardinal Cronin, and a beautiful begger woman. They discover that the police, as well as the Church don't care about the priest. But despite all this Blackie solves the mystery...in quite an amusing way to say the least. I would tell all of you beginner mystery readers to start with this one. Quite a wild ride! I loved every page of it!"
4,Fr Greeley does it again.,"Blackie is back and travels to France. In this latest book of the Blackie Ryan mysteries, Fr Greeley has Blackie and Cardinal Cronin travel to Paris and have to find a missing priest and uses this vehicle to convey a parable of love and devotion. This mystery will keep you guessing and the characters, new and familiar, will endear themselves to you.This book is a very enjoyable way to spend an afternoon but the topics will stay with you for weeks."
2,Kindle Edition Rating Only,"I will not speak to the content of the book, which I believe is wonderful, and I leave that to other reviewers. My review is only relative to the Kindle edition of this book.The Kindle edition is barely readable. When the book was converted to the Kindle format, someone did not proof read the conversion. There are typos throughout the book - which are sometimes very distracting and you have to try and figure out what the sentence actually should say.While I love the book, I would recommend that you wait until Amazon (or the publisher) corrects the typos in the Kindle edition. I have taken the opportunity to notify Amazon of the many typos and have requested that they be corrected. I certainly hope they will be soon. (Oct 2010)"
3,3and1/2 stars.Slow moving but packs a punch at the end.,This was my first Bishop Blackie book and I liked it but it did drag in places. The interchange between the bishop and the beggar girl helped to punch it up before I lost intrest. The solution when it comes makes it worthwhile. I certainly never saw it comming. But for those who like strong realisum in mysteries it is pretty far fetched. Such things do not bother me though and I think I will read about Bishop Blackie agian.
2,the begger girl of st germaine,"Not the best of Andrew Greeley. Redundant, story dragged on. I was very disappointed and even though I am an avid fan, I don't know that I would reccommend this book."
4,Pure Greeley,It is heart warming to read a book that entertains and satisfies without any slick gimmicks. Father Greeley is in his element with Bishop Blackie. I throughly enjoyed reading this book. Love and suspense and mystery...a wonderful combination.
4,The Bishop and the Beggar Girl of St. Germain.,"Once again Andrew Greeley has written an attention getting book. I enjoyed the story line. However since I cannot read french, the french phrases throughout the story were a bit distracting."
5,The Bishop and the Beggar Girl of St. Germain,"A wonderful story told by one of the greatest story tellers of our time, Andrew Greeley. Blackie Ryan in Paris, investigating the disappearance of a very popular priest and enlisting the services of a student beggar girl as his translator. An unlikely scenario for Chicago's favorite Bishop, but Greeley does it again. He makes Paris come alive and the characters are superb, you want it to go no and on. Great book."
3,not what I need,"This file organizer may be very useful for someone, but it is not what I need. This is just a book of dividers. Some pockets would be much better. No I understand why there are elastic bands attached. But if you are looking for something just like this, it's a nice reusable (with extra index strips) and moisture resistant organizer. I'll keep it since it's not worth returning it."
3,Not what I thought it was,"Maybe it's my fault, but I didn't get this from the description. I wanted something to store all of our documents that I keep in our safe. I thought this would be a great way to keep them organized. Turns out, there's no pockets or anything of the sort, it's just large dividers. I guess, the idea is to sort out entire folders or something. I wanted an all-inclusive binder with pockets and everything."
5,Some of the best in anime horror,"We stumbled on this anime online a few months ago, and were quite astonished at how good it was. Expert pacing, combinded with a suspense filled story make for quite a ride. But be warned, this anime is not for the faint of heart. It is near brutally violent. The only major flaw is, like many shows in their prime, the final episode (episode 13) leaves you on a cliff hanger that is never resolved in the anime, as the show suddenly stopped."
4,"Violence, demonic, romance","From anime TV series, this is not one of those futuristic combat shows with robots and space fleets on some distant moon. If you would rather up close and in your face, you should watch this. With these bad guys, you have to cut them to bits to kill them, but even then some of them just won't die easily! The heroes must kill them all to put back all the pieces of this mysterious box that will send them back to hell and seal them away forever."
4,A Great Opportunity,"Keith Jarrett Trio Live at Open Theater East is the next best thing to being there. The DVD release features an uncompressed PCM stereo soundtrack (in addition to the standard Dolby 5.1 surround) that is as crisp and clean as it gets. This is one of the best sounding DVD concert releases I have heard.The performance is stellar. Peacock, in particular, really shows how sympatico he is with Jarrett and DeJohnette, eliciting lots of smiles (and Jarrett's signature groans and hollers) from both.It's a very well put-together program, with the highlights being Solar, Oleo and Keith Jarrett's original, The Cure. Presented with no interruptions, it's pretty much like being there. The filming is simple, with good coverage of all trio members, without some of the quick cuts that I find irritating in some concert recordings. If you are a player, you'll get plenty of chances to watch the musician who interests you, without the others being sacrificed.Well worth the buy."
5,Astounding,"Watching these three artisits is a rare treat. They play with a level of musicianship, presence, surrender and selflessness that is extremely rare. In some pieces one wathches them becoming possessed in every cell of their being by the music, much of it clearly improvised. Watching this affects one deeply. Thank you!"
3,Talk about distraction..,"I would give this dvd 7 stars too, if it were not for one detail. The coverage of the different musicians is great, the visual quality is great, the musicians are (of course) great, but what is the deal with the annoying high-pitched noises Keith Jarrett makes?! I mean it's not even in tune with what he's playing! Talk about ruining an otherwise perfect dvd. It's really great jazz, and I attempted to look (or listen) past the ridiculous noises, but to no avail. Pure torture. Maybe I just don't have good concentration, but there is so much good jazz out there that I would never recommend this dvd. I recommend buying something else and saving yourself the unnecessary hassle--unless you have extremely good concentration."
2,Ultimately Annoying,"Okay. Let me get the contradiction started. I love the artists, the selections are interesting, and the performances top-notch. So why am I giving the DVD two stars? Keith Jarrett's annoying habits. Jarrett accompanies his own piano-playing by humming and snorting his improvisations. Imagine a Warner Brothers cartoon version of a bee humming a song, and you get the idea. I'll be the first to admit that I found (find?)the late Glenn Gould's audible humming on all his recordings more than a little charming. But Glenn was more subtle - and in key, something Jarrett cannot quite accomplish. All the positive things the other reviewers have said are on the money. There is a lot that is good about this performance/DVD. But I question whether their hearing (or system) is up to par if they can ignore this serious shortcoming. I've tried several times since I received my copy in the mail to sit down and enjoy this recording. But this annoyance is too much to bear."
2,Ultimately Annoying,"Okay, first of all, I'll agree with the other reviewers: the musicianship of these three men is astounding, their musical choices interesting, the technical aspects of this recording exceptional. So why the two-star review? The annoying habits of one Keith Jarrett.The man makes noises that distract and detract from the performance. Imagine a Warner Brothers cartoon bee humming and buzzing through his nose for the whole concert - That's Jarrett. I'll be the first to admit that I found (find?) Glenn Gould's humming on all of his recordings more than a little charming. But Gould was always subtle, and in key - something that Jarrett cannot manage.I do agree with the other reviewers regarding the positive qualities. I do, however question their hearing (or systems) if they are not distracted by Jarrett's noise-making. it's as if one were invited to watch a master chef at work, only to see him pick his nose during the food's preparation."
1,Would you put garlic on a banana split??????,"I am still in awe of what I just witnessed on this DVD. Here is an extremely talented jazz pianist playing his butt off [he rises from the stool regularly] :) ..only to poison his performance and talent with awful grunts, yelps, and moanings that in no way add any value whatsoever. It just baffles me that Keith developed this horrible habit alongside fantastic piano chops! Did he think he needed some sort of gimmick to be noticed? You'd think someone somewhere along the way would have coached him...""Hey Keith, you gotta drop that whining during your tunes...you'll lose a lot of fans if you keep that up!"" I even wonder how the other fine musicians on this DVD feel about being associated with him. They play like they don't even notice it, but I'll bet they hate it like I do. Despite the great sound and efforts by the trio don't buy this DVD if you expect the typical jazz experience you find on other DVDs."
5,Important Set--Good for school use,As a teacher this set is invaluable. The recordings are well-chosen and nicely mastered. It's a good survey of 20th century audio recordings.
4,"The Only thing we know for sure, is fear itself","I like it. I have a really good memory and by hearing these speech, I know where to put the empases on the word I say"
4,Cute,Nice hat but the ribbon around the hat is a darker brown. So the ribbon color isn't like the picture. I'm sure my daughter will still like hat for Christmas.
2,Not made of wood,"The description of this product says ""wood construction"". While I certainly did not expect solid wood for $30.99, I thought it must at least have wooden sides. Not so. There is absolutely no wood in this thing. The box says ""wood product"", which is essentially particle board.I hope Amazon corrects the product information, so people can tell what they are actually ordering."
2,Review for Mekong,"In the pan it looks mocha with subtle gold glitter, on the lid it is an extremely dark matte brown, almost just looks black. Don't buy if you're expecting a shimmery mocha, the shimmer doesn't really transfer to the eye at all. But it does wear long"
5,make me up,"I have learned alot of ways to use this eyeshadow just by watching Farah Dhukai on You Tube.I've been watching her since I had my knee surgery.She is so cute,doesn't really need makeup but what she puts on just enhances her looks.watch her and you'll see what I'm talking about. dhukai.com."
5,very sweet perfume,"I love this perfume ,the sweetnes and lasts all day and night, and the beautiful bottle is a piece of art."
2,disappointing images,"I think the producer meant well but the movie was disappointing because the sharpness and contrast of the images was so excessive that it was difficult to make them out. Manet uses a lot of very vivid colors including black in his painting and some of the images especially Olympia comes out so dark it is almost all black. Too bad, I so looked forward to this movie. The information was fairly ok though. I will look at it again anyway. For good Manet images go to Rosamund Bernier Impressionists series on four videos, especially the one entitled Modern Art and Modern Manners. These videos are all available used or new on Amazon or Barnes and Noble. I hope someday someone will make a really well done retrospective on DVD of Manet's work"
2,Poor quality,Very nice to find a DVD about the artist Manet with interesting and insightful comments and so quit disappointing the very poor quality of the images and paintings which form the very topic of the movie next to the life of the artist who made them.All this gives a feel of a very low budget moviethis of course doesn't make it a cheap one to buy.
4,After seasoning performs well,"After having a porcelain grate that rusts even though I cover my grill, I decided to upgrade when replacing. After seasoning (cooking on it 1/2 dozen times), the grate performed great. No sticking, no rust, cleans up well."
3,Stainless steel cooking grates,"I was expecting solid rods of stainless steel. This is made of thin sheet stainless steel molded in a rounded shape on the top side. Except for being much lighter than expected, it appears to be fine."
2,Not enough mass for good browning,"This is a top notch product, well made out of good material but when you toss a steak or burger on the grill you will not get those nice grill marks on your meat that you expect to see.The SS racks don't have the mass of the porcelain on steel racks my grill came with and consequently don't have the same browning effect.I will be replacing these SS racks with the porcelain on steel racks. The cast iron racks are just too much trouble to bother with."
4,Weber stainless steel grates,"The grates are fine. The question is, ""why did I need to buy them?"" For the price of my Weber Genesis Silver natural gas grill, you would not expect that the ""iron"" grates supplied with the grill would rust through in two years, especially since the grill was covered by an expensive Weber brand grill cover at all times except on the rare occasions when the grill was actually being used."
3,"2nd edition, somewhat incomplete","The third edition is more complete. The mechanism for the Wittig should be noted that it is under debate whether the formation of the oxaphosphatane is concerted or step-wise. Otherwise a good quick reference. For a more in-depth review of Named reactions, see Strategic Applications of Named Reactions in Organic Synthesis. [...]. Too bad that book has not been updated in a while."
4,A lot of pieces in this set!,"I bought this because our local library has a similar set that my 2 year old daughter cannot get enough of! There are a lot of fun pieces in this set, such as cookie cutters, a roller, timer, masher, whisk, drying rack, etc., that I did not see in other sets. The only thing that I thought was missing are cups - except for the four mugs, which I thought was strange. I am a little disappointed with the quality. I expected the plastic to be heavier and more durable. However, my daughter does use them quite a bit in her pretend kitchen and enjoys them."
3,Small Plates,"I just ordered this for Christmas for my 3 year old and 1 year old. After reading the reviews I thought this was the best value for money. The plates are TINY...even the dinner plates are tiny...so don't expect more than a small hot dog to fit on them. Otherwise I think its a great toy, but be warned about the plates."
5,Excellent Purchase!! Comes with so much and is very durable!!,I purchased this for my four year old and he loved it!!! There was so much in the box and worth everypenny!!!
5,Advanced 2 year old loves it!,"My two year old granddaughter LOVES make believe - she would pretend to cook like Mommy with whatever she had in her toy box - buckets, shovels, etc. With this set she cooks and serves dinner to everyone.She especially loves the tea kettle and utensils. She's been learning to cut her food with a knife and these pieces are a perfect size for her little hands to practice.Overall the items seem durable without being heavy, colorful and perfect for little hands (not too big and not too small)."
2,Disappointed,"Once again I should have listened to what others were saying about this product. Everything was so small, especially the plates and cups. Some of the utensils were ok but most were very cheaply made. After we gave them to our daughter, within the next day we took the majority of small stuff away (are in the process of replacing with a higher quality product). I usually read the reviews and take them seriously, I have made two purchases this past month both on Amazon, I read the reviews on both purchases, I should have not purchases them based on the reviews but I did anyway and now I am writing disappointing reviews on both items. Reviews pay off!!!"
4,Not just for toddlers!,"I purchased this set for my 6 and 4 year old daughters. Both of them went to town with it! The pastry cutter and knife can cut through Play-Doh, so my kids went straight to work cutting cookies and lasagne noodles, and scooping ice cream out of Play-Doh. There are enough pieces to set up any toy kitchen. The pots fit nicely on their kitchen's burners. However, there are a few minor issues:1. No way to store the pieces once the box is open--I need to build a cabinet or shelf2. The dish drainer's silverware container does not hold all the flatware.3. Includes cookie cutters, pastry cutter, rolling pin and mixing bowl--but no cookie sheets or baking pans.Overall, this was a well-chosen gift."
5,Literally everything but the kitchen sink.,My nephew LOVED this kitchen set!! Some of the utensils in this play set my sister doesn't even have in her kitchen!
4,Great set,"Overall we are very pleased with this kitchen set. It includes just about everything my son could need to play in his new kitchen for a reasonable price. Some other sets we looked at were cheaper but by the time you bought three pans here and utensils there, it was going to add up to way more money than just buying this one set. Our only complaint was that the timer included doesn't work properly. We contacted the manufacturer and they said they could not replace it for us. But overall, my son loves this and I think it is a great value for the money."
4,Great kitchen set,"I looked for several options but I decided to get this set. It has a lot of pieces. The size of the pieces is easy to handle for the kids, it has a lot of variety and she plays different activities everytime. I only put out a set of the things so she can enjoy. I think that if there are too many pieces at the same time she is not enjoying it as much. I think it is good quality."
4,"Small, but a lot of fun",Great toy for little hands. Everything is small and easy to store. Set could use a few additional pots and pans.
3,Some pieces are flimsy,"Lots of pieces for the price, but I wish the pots were made of heavier plastic. Several of the pots have warped so that the lids do not fit on. That said, suprisingly in the 10 months we have had it, only 2 pieces have broken. I would sugest buying additional pots for the kitchen."
4,A very nice set.,"So many pieces, a really complete set. Pieces are sturdy and well made. I got it for my grandson as a gift and my daughter said it had more items than she actually has in her kitchen!"
4,"Very cute, great deal, choking hazards are easily fixed.","I really like this set. I have an almost three-year-old, and a one-year-old. They both love to play with this set, but the only part I found to be dangerous was the lids for the salt and pepper shakers. I just super glued the lids on there so that there was no way my little one could eat them, and I think it is all good from there. For the price, this is a really great set, and it has a little bit of everything!"
3,"...a pretty long way from ""Piano Man.""","Stuck in some tripped out soul void between the Rascals & Vanilla Fudge, the Hassles sold about 100 copies of their first LP & 10 copies of the second. A lot of organ bands around New York covered songs from the first LP, & their version of ""Colored Rain"" is nervy to the edge of brilliant. The Hassles were on the road to Art Rock with ""Hour of the Wolf."" It's a silly album (check out the wolf howls) saved by some nifty Billy Joel songs like ""Cat"" & ""4 O'clock in the Morning."" This is the only context in which I can stomach Billy Joel although you probably disagree.But it's still a pretty long way from ""Piano Man.""Bob Rixon, WFMU"
3,Big Deal,"Folks on Long Island pay a handsome price for living there. If this is what they've had to listen to, it must have given rise to the Bridge and Tunnel Set (who head for Manhattan for GOOD music). You can hear stuff this good in any neighbrhood bar with a band. Sheesh!"
4,A great exemplar of the late 60's long island sound,"There was a time in the late 60's on Long Island when the music was raucus and punchy... a guitar, Hammond B-3 organ, and a strong bass and drums - perhaps a lead singer. This is the time, the place, and the music that formed Billy Joel. His band was fun to see; and fun to listen to.I bought this album to both remember that time, and to pass it on to my kids... I was there... I loved it... and it brings back great memories. (oh yea... get a first Vanilla Fudge album; and if you're lucky, you might find a Vagrants album too)."
2,"Not terrible, but not terrific","It's the early Billy Joel...and friends. Not terrible, but not terrific. If you're a BJ collector BUY IT and enjoy. If not...forget it. I got to see The Hassels perform at a small ""PR"" event one afternoon at the 60s disco ""Arthur."" We were given their new LP to rave/write about...sorry, it wasn't that good. Many years later got to see/hear him ""doodling"" at the piano, hours before a giant concert in Long Island. I got to hear some truely wonderful jazz piano that I will never forget. Wish someone had recorded those 20 odd minutes... I would have given it a full 5 stars."
2,AWKWARD lamp for the Optura 400,Odd design. Very cumbersome. The fasteners are hard to tighten and keep tight. Maybe you should buy the 500 with the built in light. If you've seen the 400 then you can really blame 'em. Where would the light go?
5,First rate cops and robbers,"Hard to tell who is evil and who isn't (Is anyone who they seem to be?) in this gripping series set in Harlan County, Kentucky. It's great noir fun as Deputy U.S. Marshall Raylan Givens chases the bad guys and the rednecks sometimes bumble around and shoot each other. Excellent acting by the stars and supporting cast. Extremely violent."
5,Tim Olyphant is amazing we anxiously await each episode.... Bravo,"This is a great series, got interested in it after finding Elmore Leonard wasinvolved. Love his writings, great cowboy style to his stories..."
5,Wonderful Series!,"I have watched this series from the beginning and I have enjoyed every minute of it! The writing, characters, filming and acting is wonderful! The men are dangerous and sexy and the women are hard-edged and unforgettable! Love this series and can't wait for the next season to come along!"
3,Third season is somewhat disappointing...,"Somehow, the 1st two episodes (all that have been shown so far) have been just a little bit disappointing...they're good, just not great, as Seasons 1 & 2. Guess I've just been spoiled by the Bennett clan from Season 2. It is *still* the best show on TV. Yes, I have Season 1 on DVD and Season 2 on Blu Ray. Also, I'm sure Season 3 will improve as the weeks go on (as the 1st two seasons did). FYI, my favorite regular character has to be Boyd Crowder (played by Walton Goggins). Now if we could only get rid of that Winona character..."
5,Awesome show,"I don't watch a lot of TV, but this show is a must not miss. Great chemistry among the cast."
5,Never Let It End!,"I have been hooked on Justified since the first episode and I guess most of the credit goes to the writers but there's no denying that the cast puts its own flavor into the stories and the way they are told. After you get past the fact that you are obviously looking at scenes of California, the dialogue gets downright homey, not all Southern, not all redneck with some classic quips that could only come from someone who has been around the South. Yeah, some of the plots are implausable. Boyd Crowder somehow stays out of jail, for example. But its all for the fun of it and for that I thank all involved."
5,We're SO hooked on Justified!,"We started watching Justified in their first season. For the first two seasons, we were able to catch missed episodes on Hulu, but when the 3rd season came along, we couldn't do so. Since we'd missed the first 3 episodes or so, we decided to wait for the videos to come out. We just HAD to order them on Amazon, because we were too anxious to wait for the boxed set at that time. We LOVE the show and we're totally hooked on it. If you haven't yet seen any Justified episodes, please start with season 1, or it just won't make much sense to you. What a GREAT show -- and what GREAT episodes season 3 has!"
5,OUR NEW FAVORITE SHOW,We look forward to each episode and we have purchased all three seasons in Bluray. Very happy with the quality and the prompt shipping.
4,Just-ified,"I bought this for my husband as a Valentine's Day gift. Men are so hard to buy for and I know how much he loves this series. So, I was amazed to get it fairly priced. It arrived fast too!"
4,Justified season three,I love this series. I think Tomothy Olyphant is a great actor and knows how to pick good characters. Definantly not something to watch with your kids.
5,Justified,OMG I love love love this show can't wait for Jan.2013 for the new season of Justified!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's a great show JUSTIFIED!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Better and better!,Please tell me that there will be a season four and five. Timothy Olyphant is as cool as he was in Deadwood!
4,a better one so far,"good plot points in this episode. they keep you anticipating whats gonna happen. im thinking we're gonna see something similar happen with the limehouse gang like we saw with the bennetts, last season. loretta makes a appearance again. wtf is going on there? there's a excellent ending to this ep."
5,The best!,"Raylan is the most awesome man ""alive"" (you know what I mean)! Every season has been equally enjoyable. Love it!"
3,Might be slipping.,"I think season 2 was the best so far. It seems like this series is getting more and more violent. Also, Raylan is getting more and more promiscuous---seems to fill time rather than come up with more story. I really enjoy the quips from Art and the other male marshal. I will continue to watch, at least for one more season."
2,"Guns, hicks and no cool chicks","I loved Justified Season One and Season Two.I couldn't figure out why I was finding Season Three such a snooze fest and then I realized all the brilliant babes were just gone...ghosts. Pretty much absent.Last season we got lots of Ava, Winona, complications and nuanced writing. There was the matriarch Mountain Mama Mobster and the Savvy OrphanGirl...and a few other great supporting woman. This season there are NO woman. Winona and Ava have had as much screen time as thetwo teenagers who flashed the trucker and performed sexual favors for drugs in the latest episode I watched...Bring out the Guns.I can't even bother watching the rest. I have never, ever, written a review on Amazon before but I am so disappointed at the nose divein this season. The lead actresses must be pissed. I gave it two stars only for my boys Raylan and Boyd, but you need more than two stars to make a show.Come on fellers, set the bar higher. Oh well, maybe next year."
1,Show plays great- if you can get past malfunctioning menus,"Received Justified Third Season all appeared well upon delivery. The disc menus don't work properly. They have text errors, don't load properly, don't appear at all, etc, etc. Luckily, we have been able to watch the programs, once we get past the menu problems."
5,Great Show,Very Funny and exciting tons of action from begining to end. Can't wait for season 4 I'm sure it will be even better.
4,Good action scenes,The series has good action scenes and logical story lines. The humorous lines mixed in with the drama are good.
5,Love this show,"Another great show from FX. Long time fan of Timothy Olyphant. I was pissed when ""Deadwood"" got cancelled but after watching Justified Im glad we get to see him play Rayland. He's definitely the sexiest law enforcement character on TV. I love the writing on the this show particularly the dialogue between characters. The cast is perfect."
3,Disappointed from Season 2,"This season didn't impress me as much as seasons 1 and 2 did. I love the setting (being an Appalachian), the characters and the storyline. Season 2 is much better though."
3,"Episodes 1, 2, & 3",It's the best way to catch up on missed episodes. You have control of what and when you see it.
2,OOps I wrote on wrong one,This is the season we have been waiting for for ever. We have to wait until the next season starts and I think that is bogus. It is not in the consumers best interest...get it together you would sell more if they were available sooner.
1,Amazon lock up,"I wanted to purchase Justified season 3 and purchased the on line video and not the disc, Amazon instructions are easy to change if purchasing disc but impossible and you are locked out to cancel the order if you want to cancel the on line video, and no help from Amazon."
1,I am done...,"Have been a justified fan since the beginning but I noticed this season the writers going too far. This last episode, ""Guy Walks Into a Bar"" just pushed the line beyond what I want to watch. No thanks to naked child molesters. I enjoyed Rayland's character but enough is enough...cancelled my amazon pre purchase of the whole season."
5,Another tremendous season!,"I have enjoyed every episode of all three years of this show and am happy to own all three seasons. Each episode is extremely well made and continues Mr. Olyphant's Lou Gehrig like record of appearing in only excellent movies and television shows. I have yet to see anything that Mr. Olyphant has appeared in that wasnt superb from ""Hitman"" to ""Crazies"" to the Justified Television Series.Of course this years episodes as well as the two preceeding it come with my highest recommendations. View everyone if there is any way for you to do so."
5,Best show on TV,Love this series. Love all the characters. Never dissapoints. Loving season four. I was hooked with season one.Need some new villians.
5,LOVE JUSTIFIED,"There is nothing I don't love about the FX series ""Justified"". I have watched all three seasons over and over and over on DVD. While Timothy Oliphant is the star and producer, I love, love, love Walton Goggins's character, ""Boyd Crowder"". Excellent casting and top-shelf performances by all of the people who have been in the series. It is above and beyond my favorite show."
5,Justified and Amazon are the best.,Just received the complete third season of Justified and while I have already seen this season on TV I cant wait to watch it again. I have numerous fans that are already asking for it now. So family first my nephew a big fan of the series is first on the list.
5,Anger Management satisfaction,"Timothy Olyphant is awesome. The way he plays a deputy marshall just makes the show. All the plots, intrigue, and life altering events happen to him just because. He handles every situation equally with no prejudice. Sort of like a mid life crisis gone astray. . ."
4,good stuff,"Entertaining show about a modern day marshal who does whatever it takes to bring about justice, and refuses to let bureaucrats steal away his soul. Tim Olyphant and Walt Goggins are both enjoyable characters who also provide some amusing humour to go along with what would otherwise be a show about degenerate crackers and crackheads in rural Kinntucky."
5,TV DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS SHOW!,"I just love every episode of JUSTIFIED's third season! I thought it would be hard to top season two with the Bennette family but season three raised the bar on awesome tv. Even though I dowloaded all 13 episodes of this season, I do plan on buying the DVD when it is availible just for the extras.The Amazon downloads were super easy....just click on buy it and instantly view it. You can view it over & over again because you now own it! Super easy."
5,Great Entertainment Value,"well written, well acted; engaging plot, interesting, sympathetic characters; gritty, realistic, and intense, grownups only; can't believe this was only $15!"
3,"Yes,but for how much longer ?","It may be that the writers are beginning to run out of ideas, but there has been a distinct move to a more urban setting in the story line, making it all look a bit too familiar among the many law enforcement programs. Too bad."
2,Amazon Prevents Resale of this DVD (and many other newer DVDs) by Buyers,"This is a great TV series and rated 5-stars for quality. But buyers be aware, Amazon lists this DVD as a RESTRICTED item, meaning its resale by you on Amazon is prevented. You are not allowed to sell this DVD and many other newer DVDS as a used DVD unless you are specially pre approved and Amazon is not approving new small sellers. Amazon is trying to eliminate its small home-based resellers. You can sell it on eBay."
5,Weber grill Cover,"You can't beat it when all you do is unwrap it and use it! The cover is a high quality, perfect fit product (odd shape and all) that looks great and fully protects the grill. I highly recommend it>"
1,Not as pictured!,The advertisement picture shows the cover below the top of the wheels. The cover I received was a full 3 inches above the top of the wheels and left the bottom storage rack fully exposed to the weather.
1,FIX THE MISTAKE PLEASE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,IF I HAD ONLY TOOK THE EXTRA 2 MINUTES TO SCROLL DOWN AND SEE THAT ME FELLOW GRILLERS HAD ALREADY MAD THE SAME MISTAKE AS I...AMAZON DROPPED THE BALL AND STILL HASN'T FIXED IT YET...COVER DOESN'T FIT PERFORMER GRILL..CALLED WEBER AND THEY TOLD ME TO ORDER 7455 AND IT WILL WORK FINE..
1,BEWARE - NOT FOR THE PERFORMER GRILL,"This item is being paired and sold together with the Weber Performer grill. This has been written about before and if I had looked at the customer comments I would not have made the mistake. However, it would be nice if Amazon would correct this problem since it appears that this has been getting reported since 2006."
1,not the right cover,"cover does not fit grill,got a defective grill first time. OK, was sent new one, now got cover and is the wrong size..others wrote about this but looks like they don;t care. Now I have to pack it up send it back and hope they send the right one. I talked to someome I could not understand and he did'nt understand me. This is America, Talk my LANGUAGE....."
1,"Great product, just buy it somewhere else","I saw this product oin the store yesterday, and I think it'll be great. Do youselves a favour and buy it somewhere else though. Amazon says it ""usually ships in 24 hours"". Now, 48 hours later, only ONE of the items (the smallest one that I just threw in for convenience) has shipped. Of course, this means that I can't cancel my order and buy it at the store now. Amazon's customer service has slipped significantly in the last 2 years. Save yourself the trouble and buy from a local retailer."
5,The Best By Far,"Java was the first programming language I learned and Head First Java was the first book I used to try and learn it. I found it funny and engaging but, more importantly, the topics stuck in my mind and I learnt the basics fast.As this was the first programming book I had used, I was assuming that all books would be this easy to use. However, other java books are tedious, vague and confusing in comparison. I soon abandoned them and returned to Head First.If I had to make a critisism of the book, then it would be that in the first chapter, there is a lot to take in and you may need to re-read it a few times before you move on but other than thatI found the book excellent."
4,slower than i thought,The book is easy and fast to read. Terms are easy to understand. With that being said i'm struggling with java. One thing i had to do with this book is totally memorize the code in early exercises to understand what i was doing. Good book your mileage may vary.
1,Look at the cover....would you take this book seriously?,"Do yourself a favor, don't buy this book. This book is discombobulated. Takes you everywhere except into detail on what you're actually doing. I've gone through a chapter, looked back and gone ""What did I just learn? Absolutely nothing. Am I stupid? Let me re-read that chapter again."" Rinse. Cycle. Repeat. After the first 6 chapters of this, I finally gave up. Too many jokes. Forced humor. Not enough substance. If I wanted to laugh, I'd go to a comedy club. I want to learn. Be serious. Scribbles in the margins messing up the source code. Book sucks. And that ""Sink A DotCom"" game? Biggest waste of a chapter. After that I just closed the book, and threw it into the garbage.If you like TV, buy this book. Plenty of remote controls in this book. lmao"
3,"Good, but not as a reference","I'm new to Java, but ancient in the world of programming (30 years of experience). When I am able to find a topic that I need to check on, this book gives a pretty good explanation of that topic. But finding the topic is a major problem. The index is ridiculously short for a book of over 680 pages. Most of the terms I need to look at (I am examining Java code written by experts and trying to figure out what it all means so that some day, maybe I will be able to write some myself) aren't in the index. As easy as it is with today's word processors to automatically generate an index, there is no excuse for having such an incomplete index. A second, associated, gripe I have is that there isn't an electronic copy (preferably PDF) of the book on a CD. Then I could do my term search using Acrobat Reader and not have to worry about the incomplete index provided. But, no CD with this book. I will probably go back to the Dietel and Dietel book as my reference."
2,"Too much emphasis on ""fun"" examples were lacking in detail","I found this book to be lacking in examples to the point of being nearly useless as a reference item due to all the ""fun"" inserted ad nauseum. It seemed like this book was written for people over 50 who know next to nothing about computers or programming. This book is well written overall but the target audience is clearly not the serious student. Get this book to learn Java basics casually but if you are in a college class this is not your book."
4,Best Computer Language Intro I've Read,"This is a great book! I've read a ton of programming books (probably just about literally) in the last two decades, and even wrote one, but this one -- as far as teaching a programming language, anyway -- is in a class (no pun intended) of its own.I like the ""Head First"" series, but some of them make me feel kind of dumb (because I don't always grok what they're saying - such as ""Head First Object-Oriented Analysis & Design""); this one is very clear and interesting.It is at the Head of its Class (again, no pun.... ah, whatever)."
4,pretty good. A bit wacky,"This book was pretty good. My only complaint was that it was a bit wacky. When I say wacky I mean that the anicdotes kind of clouded what the writer was trying to say. With that being said, there were some great examples. But there was often a lot of unneeded dialogue.Still, a good book."
5,"Fabulous, but not for evrybody","I am teaching a Java Programming class and using this book as my text. The course assumes some prior programming experience, and I believe all of students have that. In fact, most of the students are doing great! I am truly amazed at how quickly they are learning and applying concepts that other Java texts don't even touch or get into.Personally, I think the content and presentation can't be beat, but at least one of my students has a COBOL / mainframe background, and he is not adapting to the text. In fact, he said he is used to reading big reference manuals, which this book clearly is not (a good thing). I only mention this becauase the use of graphics, younger people, and the wry, hip slang they use can be a turn-off to some people.Bottom line: I think it's a great book. It is not for everybody, but then, no book can be. Buy the book, learn Java, and have fun!"
4,Head First Java - an Instructional Brew,"Head First Java, 2nd Edition is a well designed self-paced learningtool. My only complaint is the writing style sometimes makes it dif-ficult to locate specific information. The index is also a bit thinfor an educational text. Example code is provided in most chaptersand answers to the exercises are also supplied. Overall, I recommendthis book for folks trying to learn Java without enrolling in a tra-ditional class."
1,Book style is too distracting and erratic,"I'm a SharePoint Designer who writes training material; which I've had to study for Oracle, Unix, SQL, HTML, HL7 etc; and I've bought a ton of books. The style of this book has been so distracting that I just can't get through the book more than a few pages. My eye is constantly being dragged around the page looking at comic pictures. Maybe it's just me, but I've found the Microsoft Step by Step series the best at flowing you end to end. If you are a structured reader like myself, I would not recommend this book"
2,Too basic. Just a first step,This book is very very basic.If you don't know ANY object oriented programming (C++ etc.) or have no access to any instructor AND have failed to learn anything from standard resources like the Java tutorial on Sun ... this may be a decent place to start and gain some confidence. If u know C++ or any other such language ... u are better off starting with the Java tutorials on Sun and then buying a decent book on Java.The other issue with the book is ... every aspect of java is covered in one or two scenarios that makes your feel confident ... but the material on each topic is so high level that I doubt if you can go beyond that example armed with this knowledge.In any case ... you will need a second book on Java ... so why buy this?
5,Finally a Java book written for me,"This is an outstanding introduction to Java. I've done VERY basic programming in procedural languages but had a need to get some object-orientation. This book explained all the things that most other programming texts assume the reader knows and understands. To top it off, it did it in an entertaining manner.The analogies are great and while the authors frequently repeat the same concepts several times, each time they do it from a slightly different angle. I need the repetition so this method saves me from having to read the book multiple times.I first purchased the Head First EJB book but the authors clearly point out in the early chapters of that text that you really need this book first. They weren't kidding. If you need to get from a complete lack of Java knowledge to understanding EJBs, this book should come first, then the EJB book.I can only hope the authors will release a book on XML and Web Services. That would complete me (for now)."
3,Evaluation,"Basically the book was ok. The difficulty I had was when I paid for Expediate service, I was expecting 2-3 days for delivery, not five days. and when I requested the tracking# and name of delivery company. All I got was the order# which did not help me at all. I will not order from this company again."
1,This is from O'Reilly?,"This book is not up to this publisher's high standards. It is full of pictures, looking more like a comic book than a serious text. Pictures (and not screenshots, either) serve the same purpose as blank space and pretend characters: they take up space that the buyer has paid for and expects to find filled with substance."
5,"Fun, effective review.","I left Java development back when the 1.3 version of the SDK was being eagerly awaited. On return I looked for a way to review past knowledge and get up to speed with new features. Head First Java was a fun way to do both. It is not a comprehensive reference resource, it's an engaging learning model that provides you with a solid conceptual and practiced foundation for digging deeper on your own. It moves a little fast for someone completely new to programming."
2,Frustrating!,"I've done quite a bit of procedural programming with perl, but have NO java experience and no OO programming. From the introduction it seems like I'm part of their target audience. If that's the case, they fail miserably.The first five chapters of this book were pretty clear, but I found chapter 6 confusing and frustrating. For example, on page 139 there is a class. Cool. I want to type in the class and see it work. But it doesn't work. Something about setLocationCells being passed and int, but expecting a String. Or is that a <String>? Is there a difference? I have no idea. I thought strings were declared with []. Next, they present a ""Sharpen Your Pencil"" exercise on page 146 - no answers. ARGH! Now I'm stuck, frustrated, overwhelmed, and lost.I found a lot of the puzzles/brain teasers at the ends of the chapters too difficult. The author's website is not at all helpful either - it would be great if they had a message board where people could post questions and help each other out."
3,"Head First Java - Good book, bad Mobi formatting","Definitely a good book for people looking to learn java, but the formatting is awful on the kindle version (At least on the regular sized ones)The examples were often impossible to read due to their font colour. and strangely formatted with irritating page breaks."
4,Great book for learning Java,"I am a software engineer with little experience in OOA/OOD/OOP. I found this book very easy to follow and with my Linux machine in front of me, I did a lot of the sample code with little to no problems.There are still a few mistakes in the provided code but it wasn't hard to figure out what was wrong."
2,Too much unhelpful text,"This was the class textbook for a data structures course I took that was taught in Java. If you have a lot of time on your hands, the book could be an OK overview of Java, but it requires too much reading to get the point across. It also doesn't explain the basics of getting yourself set-up well. I instead relied on online resources to learn the language, and I could have done without buying this book."
1,Not for anyone who has written code before,"I grew up on Basic, C, C+, and even assembly. I have taught myself HTML, and Visual Basic. I am also a hands on learner. If I see a bit of code I want to type it and see how it works. Try to mess with it and get a better idea of what is going on. If this is your style don't bother with this book. There is nothing logical about it. It jumps all over the place. The code samples are incomplete at best. Changes are made with just a wave of the hand. I have spent more time trouble shooting code errors (not from typing, but from incorect or incomplete examples)."
1,great if you are looking for a cartoon,"I have done some Java programming but was a bit rusty and figured a overview type book would be nice. However I found this book pretty much useless. The layout is like a comic book with lots of graphics but little content. I found it worthless and will likely not look at any other Head First series books, the format just fails for me."
2,All over the place,"I really did not care for this book. I felt it was too scattered, not at all the way my brain works. Also, I don't care for books that give non-real world examples. This book uses the object of dog and methods such as bark, they could have just as well come up with real world examples of problems. You might like it, but I suggest you find a copy at the library or book store and read through a chapter first to be sure it is up with your style of learning."
3,Not For Everyone,"From an experienced software engineer...I wouldn't say that this book is bad. About half of the jokes are funny. If you like puzzle books you might like the exercises.This book teaches Java using a self-proclaimed ""engaging, entertaining, image-rich, conversational approach."" Translation: Games, cartoons, and jokes. It could be suited for beginners, but I found presentation gaps that would confuse a novice.I sold the book shortly after I started reading it. I need a more concise presentation, or at a minimum, a way to get at the meat material quickly. _Java in a Nutshell_ is my recommendation for a tutorial/reference."
4,Missing 1.5 Annotations information,"Overall great book, makes you learn what you need to know.It is missing information on 1.5 Annotations, so if you need this information you will need to find other material."
4,Java made easy,"Head first Java is great book for beginners to Java programming. The approach they fallow to explain the concepts with pictures and short stories allow readers to have more fun and easy to understand than the serious learning.If you are an object oriented Programmer already, this may not be the good book for you to learn Java, but if you are a not familiar to Object oriented concepts, this is the right book for you.As an experienced Java programmer and teacher, I was always in search of a good book to refresh my fundamentals and to fill the gaps period. I found this book more helpful for me and also for the students for the same purposes.To summarize, good book to learn Java basics. Buy one and keep reading.:)"
4,Fantastic,This book is a great resource for my beginning Java students. I suggest that they buy this as a supplement to the text book to help them understand java basics. Like the difference between a class and a object. I hope the author's are working on a newer version to correspond with Java 7. I gave it four stars because this book focuses on an older version of java (yet the fundamentals are the same).As a Computer Programming professor I would recommend this book!!
2,"Good presentation of ideas, bad example coherency.","I got about halfway through the book before I had to go get another one with more examples of coding than this one offered. Perhaps it's just the way I learn but I didn't find the conceptual stuff a problem, it was integrating all the things together and see it all presented in working order that I was finding myself frustrated with figuring out at times. I'd rather be shown everything from the ground up than given little short cuts here and there and then just expected to know where they all fit together when shown little snippets of code."
4,Excellent refresher for people who have been out of touch with Java,"This book absolutely served its purpose for me. I bought it because I had learnt java a long time ago and wanted to brush up on it. It's for anyone who is familiar with basic programming-oriented things like ""what is a float/byte,"" but who actually wants to LEARN JAVA. So, it doesn't waste time explaining these basics (which all programming books annoyingly do) but explains all the overarching concepts in a simple and easy-to-understand, yet detailed kind of way.Frankly, this book cleared up doubts I had from many of my Java textbooks from college. So, I would absolutely recommend this!And I would also recommend it for beginners. It's not hard to google ""what is a byte,"" but it is hard to understand bigger concepts in Java!"
2,"too much effort on being ""fun"" ; wastes time","I've heard great things about Head First books, but was turned off immediately. Who has time to wade through all this cutsie/hip presentation? I returned gratefully to my all-too-grownup ""Core Java"" book and blasted through everything I needed to know, and more."
5,Great Book,"Clear writing makes it easy to understand core concepts, lots of visual aids and little side projects to keep your mind and keyboard busy."
5,great book,awesome book easy to follow. I Highly recommend it if you know some programming and want to learn JAvA programming.
5,Excellent Book!!,Pretty good book for those whom Programming is difficult to understand. You will be doing an excellent purchase.
4,Good Supplement for a Java course,Very good book to use as a supplement for a Java course.Course texts need ppt slides and question banks and Case problems at the end of each chapter to supplement the text.But for buying a book to learn Java - this is a good one.
1,To Hip to be Useful,"I dislike all of the Head First series that I have read. Head First Java is no exception. I am a professional working on a master's in software engineering. I do not want or need fluff. I want to get into the nuts and bolts quickly. This book is useless in this regard. I also find the presentation of the material insulting. Serious programmers/engineers should look to Java How To Program by Deitel as an authority. Head First java may be interesting and useful to the young, those who need to be entertained to learn, or have zero to minimal exposure to Java/Programming. I will not be purchasing another title in the Head First Series. If you need this text for class, you are better served by Deitel and/or web searches."
2,Too much fluff,About 65% of the material is useless fluff. Authors try to be funny and silly.I'm not an expert programmer. I took a few programming courses (C++) in college. It doesn't provide a good reference either.If you prefer technical books to be to the point this book isn't for you. If you've tried other Java books and it didn't help I guess this one will not hurt.It does have the information you need if you're willing to dig for it.
3,Only good for beginners,"I have bought and read through the first edition of this book. Yes, it acts like a comic book and offers lively explanations to some Java concepts. But I think it is only suitable for Java beginners.There are many important concepts that are not mentioned in this book, like for example, Inner classes, the use of wait() and notify() methods, etc. If you are studying for the Sun Java exam, do not soley depend on this book.Nevertheless, this book is really good for beginners since I mentioned the fundamental concepts very well. I have not read the second edition, but it just includes the new features of J2SE 1.5 release."
3,Head First into ?,"Not sure about this book. With almost 700 pages it is a little daunting. There are a lot of examples, cartoons, jokes, etc. so you aren't reading 700 pages of text. It does have an interesting way of presenting things. I think it may be of more use as I get more into coding java."
1,Hold it! Not suitable for beginners.,"This book is for beginning Java programmers, NOT beginning programmers. Big difference. I wish the book description had said this rather than read it in the book after buyng it. And if you do not know how to set a PATH statement so that your computer can find the javac.exe in the BIN directory of your J2SDK, then you are going to be lost before you get to page 1. All this is assumed knowledge by the authors.I put this book back on my bookshelf to be revisted after I complete the SAMS Learn Java in 24 hours book. (Oh, I do know how to set PATH statements from my previous experience using DOS. You should learn how to do this also.)"
2,Too Whimsical for Me,"I am taking on-line classes in Java. I thought this book would be a good way to get more detailed insight into the material covered in the class. However, the topics seem way too scattered and whimsical for my needs and liking. I really want to be able to look up a topic (such as loops) and get the information in one chapter. The index is minimal. The book may work if you use it as a tutorial and got through it starting in chapter 1."
2,Eh... Quite Unimpressed. Not recommended,"With so many reviews and such a high rating, I had high hopes for this book.The book just moves WAY too slow with the constant joking. The lack of good examples and exercises makes me feel like I'm not learning anything. I just felt like I was reading a book with poor humor.If you're serious about learning Java and want to learn by programming, I recommend passing on this book. If you want to read about Java and don't feel like actually practicing what you're reading, this book may be for you."
2,"Good for philosophy, poor for actual programming","This is a book that I really wanted to like. I actually do think the humor is pretty cute and engaging. I have a better understanding of what OOP means thanks to this book. But for actual programming in java? Nope. This book skips over the basics that everyone needs to know just to get a simple program to work in order to focus on the deep concepts and fun things like MIDI beatboxes that you will never get to work.Now, it's not as if I don't know the difference between a for loop and a while loop. I know how to do them in C++, Python and Pascal thanks to books by Gaddis and Savitch. It's just that I have no clue how to implement these basic things *in Java.*Now, the book says that you should have 'some' programming experience and I do. No, you really do need to have a lot of programming experience in Java before this will be of any use. But I think such a person will be looking for a more in depth book."
5,Excellent introductory book to learn Java and OOP philosophy,When I was found this book I was trying to learn Java from Deitel&Deitel; but I couldn't understand the esense because of the verbose style that they used.Then I search about Head First in generall and I gave it a shot because of the reviews and for the teaching style that they were discribing.I am happy that I did it. I understood Object Orientation and basic principles. Most important I had great time reading it.It even explains a hard subject for beginners as Event Handling and makes it relatively easy to grasp.
3,ok for Java 5.0 not java 1.4.x series,"the book is very well elaborated, i give it 3 stars not because of the book itself but because i think Sun screw up in terms of compatibility code( if they had that intention at all). if your planning to use java version 1.4.x series buy another book, i can't even run the simple exercises on page 12!!!!!!!!!"
5,Excellent book.,"This is an excellent book even for advanced programmers. I would describe the style as ""annotated text"". It doesn't hurt that the annotations are funny or cute."
2,Didn't work for me,"This book didn't work for me. I found the pictures, stories, and games both damaging to clarity and distracting from the task of learning java."
2,Too cool to be useful,"To be concrete: it's a very enjoyable piece of reading but if you really wanna learn Java, please get Core Java by Cay S. Horstmann and Gary Cornell. Lot's of jokes and images but very few java."
5,Great for beginners,"I'm a Flex developer with few knowledge about Java, so I picked this book to be the first one I was going to read on Java. This turned to be a good decision as the book explains in detail and in a funny way how Java works. After finishing the book I was already looking for other books by the same authors. It was simply captivating.However I wouldn't recommend this book for those coding in Java for more than one year."
3,Not what I was looking for -- too cutesy in presentation and not enough actual teaching,"Typically, I have trouble doing the first thing. The tutorial programs wouldn't compile using the compiler that came on my iMac and there were no hints from the book that this might happen or what to do about it. As a reference book, it is weak. My opinion is that this would be a great book to learn from in a classroom setting with an expert available to fix things that don't work. I bought this book from Amazon after I bought another book from a bookstore which I read first -- I learned a lot from that book because I wasn't trying to compile anything."
3,Good for someone who is brand new to Object Oriented Programming,"I was hoping for more from this book. I guess I wanted more than just a basic introduction to Java. I have the Head First SQL and Head First C# books and I enjoyed them greatly. This book got me going into Java and did help to explain some Object Oriented stuff that I did not feel that I picked up on in the Head First C# book, but by the end of the book I did not feel that I really grasped so much of the language as I did with the C# book. If I had been brand new to programming, I probably would have loved this book, and I still do enjoy what it taught me about Object Orient Programming, just not so much the Java part of it."
3,a fair textbook,"This book as a one of the few modern Mongolia textbooks out there in the market does do a good job presenting basic Mongolian grammatical concepts, with a plus since it has an accompanying cassette. However, this book does not do a thorough job in laying out Mongolian grammar and it has many typos which are really irritating. In comparison Colloquial Mongolian is a better book both in terms of presenting Mongolian language, culture and the price of the book."
3,Good Introduction But Lacking,"I am living in Darhan, Mongolia, and have been doing full-time Mongolian language study for 8 months. I ordered and used this book as part of my language studies. This book gives a good introduction to Mongolian and it helps to have some grammatical explanations in English. The exercises in the book are good for practice. However, the book is insufficient for learning Mongolian fully, either spoken or written. There are some errors in the book - grammtical and the use of some endings (suffixes). This book helps as an introduction to the language and gives an overview of some basics, but as said, is not sufficient to really learn the language."
4,Excellent,"I can't credibly speak for the Kinks' early output, but regardless, this is one great album. I have waited for a long time to find it on CD, since my cassette has basically died. This CD and ""Give The People What They Want"" are to me the apex of the latter stage of the Kinks' career. The title track is one of my favorite songs ever."
4,A MUST HAVE,I give this CD 4 1/2 stars (outta 5). I'm glad to see this and Word of Mouth are finally available on Disc (although I disagree with the 2 previous reviews and think this is slightly better). Do yourself a favor: buy both and decide for yourself. You won't be dissapointed with either.
4,BEST OF THE 8O's KINKS,"Having been a huge Kinks fan from the beginning, I tend to view the Kinks output within the different era's in which they have produced music. For me the 1980's produced a lot of outstanding straight forward rock music from the Kinks. With this record, they reached their peak from this era. Outstanding songs throughout with excellent bonus songs ""Once a Thief"" and ""Noise"". Not a bad song in the collection. A few mediocre songs mar what could have been one of their best ever. A solid 4 1/2 stars. Their final release from this era, ""Word Of Mouth"" would also include some great songs, but would fall short of the consistency of this record."
4,nearly perfet,I use this magnifier in restaurants to read the menu and the bill. It is portable and bright enough for dim rooms. I would have liked the shape to be longer to be able to read whole lines more easily.
5,A real lifesaver,Thank god for Amazon. I can never find things like this at a shopping center. This thing works great and it was cheap. Highly recommend getting a few to leave around the house.
3,Good magnifier but...,"it probably needs expensive, hard to find button batteries. Distorion is minimal and it is carryable (although the plastic lens does not go into the bottom of the case as it appears it might do --- thus, more chance for scratches.If not for the batteries, definitely four stars. Not a bad item and the light does not have to be used --- although it's a very nice feature."
4,very handy to have on a computer desk,"This magnifying glass is very handy to have on a computer desk. I used to have to use one pair of glasses to look at my computer screen, which is about 2 feet away from my eyes, and another pair of glasses when I need to take a quick look at some notes on a piece of paper. Not anymore with this magnifying glass! Now I can just keep my ""computer glasses"" on and use this magnifying glass when I need to take a quick look at some small text.The glass is better looking in actuality, but also a bit smaller than I thought. I can only have a couple words in focus at a time, thus the 4 star rating instead of 5."
4,Help for aging eyes,"Since getting lens implants following cataract removal, I've thrown away the glasses I'd worn all my life. Don't even need readers. However, really fine work, especially in limited light, is a challenge. I saw a similar magnifier in use and purchased this item after an Amazon search. Just what the doctor ordered. Sliding it open lights the bright LED light, closing it turns the light off; couldn't be simpler. Optics are clear. I only wish that the lens were protected when closed to prevent dust from accumulating and the inevitable scratches that will occur if this is carried around. Nice product, fair price."
2,Magnification not 3X,Great magnifier in all aspects and loved it except it does not magnify 3X. I compared it to a large 3X magnifier glass I have and this product looks more like a 2x. I kept it to use at my desk but bought a Carson through Amazon for traveling. It is a 3X glass in my test and works great.
4,Good Small Print Reader,"I purchased this after reading many reviews on Amazon as well as other sites. As I get older, it is becoming somewhat difficult to read small print product model numbers as well as serial numbers. This is perfect for that. I also use it in dark resturants to read menus. It is small enough for me to put it mr pants pocket when I don't need it.The field of undistorted magnification is pretty small but is good enough for my purpose. I also purchased one for my wife as well as my son-in-law. Both of them concur with my statements. The LED light is bright enough that in many cases I did not need the magnification to read the menu."
2,Defective LED Light,"Upon receiving one of these I discovered the light flickers and it is extremely dim! The light is unusable and this one is going back to Amazon for replacement. It appears behaving in a similar fashion as another customer (S. Gaston ""flower lady"") experienced and reported!"
3,Okay,"The screen of the magnifier is small. If you're looking to read text this is not going to work. Though I have not attempted to replace the battery, battery container seems to be contained by a very small screw-A Phillips screwdriver-of which would have to be incredibly small. I dread having to replace his battery."
2,should've listened to the others,"The viewing area is really, really small, 1.5 inches to be exact. I have to close one eye to focus."
5,best pocket flashlight magnifier I've ever used,"I got one of these around 2007 and took it for granted. The lens was perfect for reading, the light was just the right intensity, the pull-out feature for light deployment felt solid, and the whole unit just had a dependable simplicity about it. I assumed this sort of gadget was common.Then in 2010 I lost my Lightwedge, and I had a hellish time trying to replace it. I didn't remember the name or where I'd purchased it, so I tried every other pocket magnifier I could find. They were all awkward, flimsy, hard to read, or all of the above.Just the other day someone suggested I search for my long-lost magnifier on Amazon, and I ended up ordering a couple of possible replacements. When I received this one, I was disproportionately thrilled to have my perfect old pocket magnifier back. Thanks, Amazon!"
2,Disappointed with Acquarella Moisturizer,"I am a big fan of Acquarella nail polish, but am disappointed with the moisturizer that goes with it. I was trying to avoid using hand moisturizers with oil in them, since they can interfere with the polish adhering to your nails. So I bought Acquarella Moisturizer to complete my nail care set. I used it for about a day, but the skin around my nails kept getting drier and started peeling. I think that scrubbing to remove the Acquarella Conditioner had dried out the skin around my nails, and the moisturizer was not helping at all. It was a waste of money. Instead I am going to get some jojoba oil to use along with the Acquarella nail polish."
2,Just get a bottle of aloe vera gel,"This isnt really anything special. Its just a gel with aloe and PCA, and I have had just as good results from either aloe vera gel, PCA spray, or safflower oil. This is supposedly to go with their nail polish, which I do love by the way, but again, I didnt notice any great moisturized results."
5,Fabulous,This is a wonderful book. Larkin Van Horn is such a talented beader. Her work is beautiful and skillful.
3,Not really my style,"but nothing wrong with it. There are many nice designs and tips, but just not exactly what I was hoping for."
1,Waste of money,I was looking for and intelligent adult film with attractive people in it. What I got was some lame film with a few fairly attractive women that you don't get to see very much of. The photography was all over the place and the scenes were short and jumpy. All the women had super huge breasts and most looked fake. And you didn't see too much other than their breasts. I wish I didn't spend the money. I bought this DVD after reading the good reviews and now I'm angry. Don't waste your money...really!
3,Let us all with one accord sing praises to our heavenly Lord.,"This is a Christmas album by soul singer Jackie Wilson. It was originally released in 1963. The songs are all Christmas standards, with no new songs written for the album. The songs are arranged in an ""easy listening"" style that doesn't really suit Jackie's soulful voice. I would much rather have heard these Christmas songs played with some soul, instead of in a bland style that would be much better suited for Pat Boone. Despite the rather dull arrangements of the songs, Jackie does sing them extremely well. His singing on ""Joy to the World"" is especially impressive. This is a decent Christmas album, but I was expecting something more exciting from ""Mr. Excitement""."
2,lukewarm,the old ones were noisy and warmthese are quieter and not as warmnoisy and warm better in my case
3,Disappointing,"This book comes with an undersized CD, including correct pronunciations of Hungarian words.But alas, it lacks the Hungarian-English side of the dictionary, which apparently is available only under a separate cover. I wish I'd known that before buying it.Instead, I recommend both Hippocrene'sHungarian-English/English-HungarianConcise Dictionary andHungarian-English/English-Hungarian Dictionaryand Phrasebook, both of which include Hungarian words. English speakers need something including Hungarian words for sojourns in Budapest --- and definitely in the countryside, where very few people understand a word of English."
1,weird combination,"The dancing is creative and excellent. However, I can help but wondering why they can't find an equally creative musician to write the new music for it? Why they reuse Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty? The heart-breaking and ear-jarring screams uttered by the lady giving birth to an egg and the scene of handgun firing on the stage are not even remotely associated with beauty.Am I biased because I watched the classic ballet Sleeping Beauty before? No. I only heard the music on CD. When watching this dancing, I feel as if I was watching ""Terminate 2"" with all figures spoke Shakespeare's language...The one star is for all the dancers. Other than that, I could not find any other thing to praise. Perhaps those who want to taste raw fish slices with A1 sauce wrapped in tortillas, and eating with a can of New Coke, might like it."
5,This one will make the Grinch on your Christmas list smile,"Score one more for Rhino. This label really does know how to find obscure cuts and bring them into standout various artist collections. The only gripe I could have is this disk sounds a bit monaural in a mix, but I'll still use it--it's fun to mix up a little blues with the typical sugary Christmas sentiment.What can I say about this collection that has not been said? Just add Lightning Hopkins, John Lee Hooker, Canned Heat and the rest of the crew in and you've got a mix that'll make your season funky."
2,Poor dubbing,"Was initially happy to purchase this disc,mostly because it was the first time that ""Night Owl"" was avaliable on CD. The recordings on ""Night Owl"" seemed different than the original (vinyl), not as crisp, and slower. I actually timed the title song and compared it to the original. Not surprisingly, it took about 20 seconds longer to play. The dubbing of this disc is not what it should be. If you really want ""Night Owl"" on CD and don't want to wait, then purchase. Otherwise I would secure an avaliable copy of ""City to City"" and wait for future releases of ""Owl""."
5,Muy Sabrosa (Very Tasty),"I like most people first heard Gerry Rafferty on the Stateside of the Pond when he was with Steelers Wheel,I have always liked his basic use of Acoustic Guitar/Bass/Drums/Keyboards & Sax, as well as his double tracked vocals ,Gerry has a great sense of Harmony & Melody ,something that is sorely lacking in the Rock Music scene today .These are Gerry's first 2 Albums and are Dynamite well worth the purchase. Drummer Henri Spinnetti is on these disc's and he has done work with Paul McCartney and others ."
5,Two Great Albums!,"City to City and Night Owl are two fantastic albums by Gerry Rafferty. These two belong together, as they were released a year apart and contain similar songs and many of the same musicians. A real one-two punch that assured Rafferty's place among the best singer/songwriters in popular music. The sound quality on the CD's I received is first rate. They sound great on inexpensive computer speakers, and even better on a higher end sound system. The package arrived a day earlier than scheduled and in perfect shape. The lack of any real booklets or album information is a negative, but for the price you simply can't beat the value. Highly recommended!"
5,Good Vendor & Great Album,"I chose this rating because the vendor shipped it safely and it arrived to my father a few days in advance, as a Christmas gift. He was craving a good Gerry Rafferty CD and I thought this may fit. He was quite pleased with the selection of songs from both albums and he said the sound quality is great through his JBL tower speakers."
4,Fast-paced story rich with New York jargon and hip hop flava,"Although I was familiar with Nelson George as an author, this was my first time reading one of his books. I was thoroughly impressed. Being from the New York area and being close in age to the main character, I could easily relate to the story. The story also interestingly chronicles the growth of D. Harper, the main character. If you think you'll enjoy reading about the music industry and New York in the late 70s, the 80s and early 90s with glimpses of the New York club scene, you'll love this book."
4,Very HIP!!,This is a very hip book. It takes a slice of americana that isn't written about very often. It was a breezy well written believable story of life in urban african-american society. I'm reading Urban Romance now!!!.
5,A true tank of a watch...,"This is a magnificent timepeice from Invicta. Its design originality and functionality is nearly unmatchable. I've owned this watch for nearly four years and have only needed to replace the battery and have the chrono-seconds hand ""reswedged"". I have also received many a compliment on it as well, a real attention getter.I enjoy wearing a watch that has some bulk and weight to it, so this is a proper mix of both. It feels like a sturdily-built timepeice. Surprisingly, as heavy as it is, unless you wear sweaters or tight cuffed shirts you'll hardly notice it on your wrist. It's that comfortable."
3,Lasted one day,I bought this for my 5 year old son - he can't sit still so this was the perfect way for him to practice math.... and he loved it for the first day and only day he had it. My son stepped on the on/off switch and it broke. Lasted one day. Wish it would have been more durable because he was so excited about it.
1,Junk,"This educational game did not last a day in my house.The battery compartment was ridiculous to get into.Looks more fun than it actually is, wouldnt waste my money"
2,Seems like a good fun idea.....,"But they need to make one major change and flip the way its' printed. They should start with the ""1"" on the left and go counterclockwise...which of course is against clock time but it doesn't line up with that either! My 7 year old son played with it for one day and shows no more interest in it because the number placement. My 12 year old thinks is pretty cool and could adjust to the backwardsness of the numbers..but loses interest too."
4,Math Mat,"I purchased this item for both my 3 yr old and 5 yr old boys. Since they are quite active I thought it would be a good way to learn while still being able to move. They both love playing with the math mat and since you can change the level of difficulty it works for both of them. However, as in other reviews stated, I don't know that they will actually learn how to do math but will definitely be more familiar from the repetition."
4,Fun Math Facts,"Both of my kids love playing with the math mat. The numbers game is way too easy, but the level 1 addition and subtraction is about right for my 5 year old and my 7 year old uses the level 2 games to practice math facts. The kids get lots of exercise when playing since they circle the mat during the question, then run to the answer."
3,how old is this book?,This book is actually not bad. Tha auther seems a bit unsure what he wants to talk about at the begining though adn it is based on linux redhat 6.1 and 6.2. Where is the 7.1 version? half of the book is out dated and it is about time they released something up to date. For example the section on inetd should now be xinetd and the details are copletely different. Also some of the answers to the example questions are wrong and I can prove it!
1,Outdated Version,I bought this book without reading the reviews and I say don't buy this book unless you have a back dated version of RH Linux you need to support. Get a more current version that covers RH 5.x.
3,Makes a great gift-really ties the room together,Nice mouse pad. Get it for you're local unemployed bowler friend types with associates named Wo.It really ties the room together.
1,Comically expensive for the equivalent of a paper clip,"Folks, it's a *mousepad,* not a real rug, no different from any other mousepad except for the cutesy pattern and the fringes. It works no better, and sometimes worse -- jerky, for instance -- than the Amazon mousepad for $4 or the same one mousepad at Staples for the same price. At a couple of dollars more, maybe; but at a 400% premium?!? -- another $16 for something you'll spill coffee on and have to replace? Buy five $4 mousepads instead. You'll have one that works fine, and have four as backups in case you spill food on it."
3,Too small for the camera,"While the case itself seemed fine, it is too small for the Canon HR-10. The Canon site lists this as a suggested accessory for the HR-10, but the camcorder will not actually fit inside the case, the lid cannot close. If you have a smaller camcorder then this could be a very efficient and easy-to-carry case, but check the measurements since this case does not have a lot of extra space."
1,Too Small for camera,"Even though the product information indicated that this case would be a good fit for our camera, Canon Vixia HF10, it was way too small. It would fit the camera, but that is it. You can't even fit the small spare battery in there. If you are considering this case for that camera, go up a size."
3,Get rid of the typoos,"I like the books of Sara Paretsky, this review is about the alarming increase of typoos in the Kindle editions. This may have an adverse effect on the future of this otherwise very smart way of reading. The books are typed into Kindle form too hastily and then checked by rather stupid software for errors. The result is Hispanic spelled as his panic. Utterly ridiculous. The typoos are too many to count, does this bother anybody at Kindle? Maybe Sara Paretsky should have a word with Kindle."
1,Kindle needs to withdraw this book,"Definitely DO NOT order this book. The formatting problems are not minor and Kindle should withdraw this title and fix it. At one point it completely forwarded to the middle of the second book. Elsewhere you enter conversations in progress and a page or so later the parties THEN greet each other. This happens at each point where the large headings appear at the ""beginning"" of chapters.I am close to giving up and expect Kindle to give me a credit for this book. One of the problems I can see with the Kindle is how difficult it is to know whether paragraphs are out of order. This is a killer flaw on an otherwise great product. Amazon, you better be paying attention... how many other titles have this same problem?"
2,Kindle Only Review,"Some formatting problems - each chapter start is a few paragraphs out of sequence. Poor editing, didn't anyone proofread this? Also no way to skip to the second book (no table of contents).That being said THE EYE OF THE TIGER is pure classic Wilbur Smith. Lean and action packed, usually the first book I recommend when someone asks about his books."
5,This CD will have you praising and worshipping God,"I bought this CD for one song, I Trust You. However this CD is amazing. My eight year old son loves it as well. The entire CD is wonderful. It takes you to a praise then to a worship then back to praise and then back to a worship. Awesome. I could listen to it all day and night. It has 17 songs on it. It is very rare to purchase a CD and you like all of the songs. I can honestly say I like all the songs. You will get your money's worth from this purchase."
2,Need another one,"It was a library copy yet description only noted it was used. When I received it in the mail a note was attached saying it was a library copy that had been buffed and cleaned. It played for a few days and now it skips and sends my cd player an error of ""NO Disc found"". Very unhappy"
5,Very Good!,"This CD is worth the purchase! I'm glad I purchased it! It has a several different styles of Gospel. Some of the styling reminds me of Kirk Franklin, nevertheless it is a great CD. It will entertain you and minister to you."
4,A nice collection if you can't afford individual albums.,"This set is definitely for hardcore Monkees' fans. It comes with an informative booklet, with stories behind the songs; all the singles; and almost all of the major album tracks. But with Rhino's reissue of the entire Monkees' catalog on CD, this box set is hardly necessary anymore unless you just can't afford the individual albums."
3,Cheap Tin-Type Metal,"If your amp weighs more than 30 lbs or so I'd skip these and buy something more ""substantial"". I can't imagine the screw holesholding over time as the stress is put on these while lifting and moving around your cabinets. The metal is paper thin and whoknows how long the tubular handle of this thing will stay connected to the cheap surrounding material.For the money it's a deal I guess, compared to the heftier versions but I'd be very concerned about installing these in anythingsubstantial."
3,"Been there, done that","A current and concise book with relevant helpful details for selecting a decent restaurant while traveling in Italy.The resturants listed are largely a matter of taste, but in general are quite good. I never felt ripped off by any of the restaurants the author recommends. Her assessments were fairly accurate, although the dishes she describes aren't necessarily available.One major criticism is the organzation of the material. The book isn't the easiest to follow. It requires flipping between pages and sections to gleen together map locations and specific information."
4,The (second) best introduction to Hickox' Rubbra Series,"Rubbra is `tough' music, but it yields its rewards - and it is thanks to Hickox (and Handley) we even have a chance to hear for ourselves. And if an English variant of Eduard Tubin sounds appealing to you, you might lap Rubbra up. The set of the complete Rubbra symphonies might be overkill for a newcomer to this music, but Symphonies Two and/or Five should be sampled. Unfortunately there is no coupling of those available, but Five and Eight (Rubbra's three-movement ""Hommage à Teilhard de Chardin"") are nearly as good an introduction."
5,The real winner!,"Clay has that special ""something"" that will take him right to the top. I'm looking forward to his next CD. He has a voice that takes my breath away! This is a must buy for all Clay fans."
5,Excellent,"I just got the CD yesterday but I could not get just one. I had to get four--because my friends also love Clay's songs. That said, I'm not speaking for myself when I say it's a great buy-- WE AGREE and WE LOVE IT. This Is The Night (track two) should be Track One (IMO) but I love both tracks. I'll be on loop for a while with this one---but I know I won't be alone!"
5,CLAY IS AMAZING. NOT AT ALL DISAPPOINTING..JUST GREAT,"I COULDN'T WAIT FOR THE SINGLE TO BE RELEASED. AND I WASN'T THE LEAST BIT DISAPPOINTED IN THE RESULTS. CLAY HAS AN AMAZING VOICE. HE SHOWS HE CAN SING ANYTHING. THE BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER IS VERY GOOD, THE CHORUS COULD HAVE BEEN NOT AS LOUD. BUT THIS IS THE NIGHT IS AMAZING. THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL SONG, AND CLAY JUST GIVES YOU CHILLS WHEN YOU HEAR IT. HE PUTS HIS HEART AND SOUL IN HIS SINGING AND YOU CAN DEFINITELY TELL. HIS VOICE IS STRONG AND ON PERFECT PITCH THROUGH THE ENTIRE CD. THIS IS A GREAT PURCHASE!!!...I AM EAGERLY AWAITING THE FULL ALBUM RELEASE. CLAY IS WONDERFUL...WE ALL LOVE YA CLAY....."
3,Shoddy Production,"I am a huge Clay fan - what a voice. He's definitely got the chill-bump inducing ""X"" factor. Performed live, his cover of Bridge was just amazing - the absolute best of American Idol - as was TITN. CD though? It's just not that great - BOTW choir totally drowning him out at times? What's up with that? TITN was very good, but not as excellent as the live performance. Bottom line, here's a guy who does what most singers cannot: sounds better live. I'll keep listening for him, but really hope someone slaps whoever let them release this version, and that the album does him justice. I'm sure he's horrified, too."
5,Clay rocks!,This single is so awesome. Clay has an amazing voice and he should have won American Idol. But the numbers show that his single sold more than Ruebens did and it was well deserved! Everyone should get this single and Clay's CD when it comes out in October! Clay rocks my socks!!
5,Can't Wait for the Full CD!!,After listening to this single I can't wait until the full CD is released. After buying too many CD's with only one or two good songs on them it will be great to buy a CD I know will be full of hits!
5,Clay Aiken can sing the PHONE BOOK!,"If Clay Aiken were to sing the entire phone book, the dictionary, and ten encyclopedias, I would still buy it. I would buy anything from this amazing artist! This guy has a brilliant voice. I cannot believe the power and the range, and this is a guy who was on a ""reality"" show. What's this about coming in second? His voice proves who the real idol is. The songs themselves are only so so, but the voice is a thing of absolute beauty and amazement!"
5,Amazing!,"This album is amazing! Clay has such a great voice and is so talented! Both songs are sang wonderfully and are perfectly mastered. It is worth the money to buy! This is true talent, and everyone should listen to it, and see what a star he is!"
5,Clay is the Best!,"I love this CD. I can't wait for his full album. Clay has such a beautiful voice and range. Clay's morals and principles are very refreshing. I have not bought a CD in many years, but do not regret buying this one. The Adult Contemporary radio station in my city has not chosen to play Clay's songs. Too bad for the radio station, the station has missed out on a golden opportunity to add listeners as I know that I would have started listening to that station to hear Clay's songs. However, I just play his CD in my car and turn off the radio stations."
5,&quot;THIS IS THE BEST&quot;,"Okay, if you know me i am a totally obsessed clay fan. I have followed him from day 1. This CD is so amazing!!! I mean just think, that voice coming out of him! I have listen to Rubens single and i actually compared clays and his. Clay has so much more...... Power in his voice i guess you could say.He and his voice is so amazing and inspiring to almost anybody.This Is The Night IS the best song i have ever heard. Trust me and go buy it!!! North Carolina representin'(HAHAHAHA)"
2,"Empty, Hollow, Overproduced Schlock","I'll give it two stars for his over-enunciated, technically proficient singing.As someone who works in radio, let me tell you straight: You Will NEVER hear either of these songs on the radio. Bet me a dollar.I mean... really, kids... Can you possibly imagine ANY radio programmer in his right mind playing either of these songs next to Nelly, Timberlake, 50Cent, Aguilera, etc... We have a term for that... ""Train Wreck""Oh, I suppose some easy listening or small market Adult Contemporary Station might play This Is the Night, but I wouldn't hold my breath.Don't get me wrong.. he seems like a nice kid (even if he does bite his toenails..yechh -see Rolling Stone) He's just not a pop singer...He's got talent, but these songs really, really [are bad] I couldn't imagine hearing his rendition of Bridge Over Troubled Water anywhere outside a tent revival in Deluth.Peace.. .out"
3,Clay Aiken:Is this his night?,"I purchased the Clay Aiken single yesterday and listened to it a million times. It is a powerful mix of a classic and new fresh song, but is it a good new fresh song? I think the song ""This is the Night"" is cute and he sings well on it, but the lyrical content is much less than lacking. He walks away with that song with a just ""okay"" review, hopefully there will be better content on his full-length album (""Claymates"", please dont chew me out). His version of ""Bridge over Troubled Water"" is wonderful. He breathes new life to the song and makes it seem fresh. I like this song, but with some hesitations. I feel as if it is sort-of over produced and under produced at the same time. I think that at times, the choir overpowers him. General feeling? Pick up the single. Clay Aiken is a wonderful talent and has an amazing voice."
1,He bores me!,"I'm not escited about his voice, I don't like BOTW! He's second to Ruben that's what America remembers!"
2,Nothing to Write Home About,"The music is okay and the vocals are okay too. I heard it at my girlfriend's home, but I'm glad I didn't buy it. Give me Barry Manilow any day of the week, or Peter Cetera for that matter."
5,Left me wanting more!,"After hearing Clays single, it left me wanting more...I pre-ordered this CD...we listened to it in my office and everyone was speechless, Clay's voice is truly a gift from above! Could have done with more Clay and less back up on Bridge over troubled waters, but still spectacular. Awaiting hs August CD with ""Solitare""."
3,An Almost Polished Jade,"Well, his voice is original and magical. However, he's still not yet fully polished. After catching his performances in American Idol, he's certainly the brightest star among them. But, there are still some, understandbly, flaws in his singing. For example, when he hit the high pitch in 'Somewhere Out There' at the very end, his voice trembled and lost its stability. And he's more suitable to sing certain pieces, not all of which he's performed. A very promising future star, though. Keep it up!"
2,"YAWN....If I wanted a Broadway single, I would have gotten","The Hairspray cast album. More suited for Broadway, less suited for pop. Love his voice, but the singles were poorly mixed. Ruben got the better deal with his single. Plus he's the winner, collector's item. 10 years from now, you'll remember Clay like Sam Harris from Star Search. ""Who you say?"" Exactly."
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"Over produced to the point of being just plain bad. I suppose the guy can sing somewhat but this CD tries to hard. It was painful to listen to. The only reason this is number one now is because crazy people are buying 10 and 20 copies, which I guess makes his #1 status kind of bogus."
1,Not impressed,"I wasn't impressed with Clay Aiken's CD. I'm just not feeling his music. He definitely belongs in the Easy Listening category and if this CD is like anything we should expect from Clay in the future, I don't think he will last in this business."
2,"I love his voice, but can't listen to it very long.",I'd love it if he becomes one of those broadway singer. Will definitely be his big fan. But I think this kinda songs are not for him.
5,Clay's CD,"Clay's voice is amazing, fresh, and unique. It's a wonder to me that he did not win American Idol. This CD is a great buy if you want to hear fantastic singing and two wonderful songs. I know we're counting the days til Clay releases a full album."
5,A great start!!!,"I love this man...his voice sends chills right up my spine everytime he sings. I was a little disappointed with the recorded version of Bridge over troubled water...I just think it could have been mixed better. I think that the background singers were too loud, but they can't cloud this amazing voice. I couldn't wait to buy this and can't wait for his debut album. I haven't heard a voice this good on a man in a LONG time."
5,Clay Aiken CD is tops,I bought the CD with the pre-order option as soon as I found out it was available and it was great. I had no complaints other than it is way too short. We need an album with this great singer and I am watching for one everywhere in hopes of pre-ordering it too. He is an up and coming star whose time has come and will go a long way. The CD was everything I thought it would be and more.
5,Clay Aiken,"I am so excited that Clay has gotten the rocognition he so well deserves. Since his audition on AI, I fell in love with his voice. After finding out more about Clay, I like and respect him even more. He is a great role model for America today. He is generous, honest, humble and more importantly, a Christian. His personality and wit makes him adorable. Hooorayyyy for Clayyy!!!! :)"
5,COMPELLING!,Clay's music is so habit forming that it is difficult to wait for his next CD. Had to download some songs in order to hear more. THIS IS THE NIGHT has turned out to be one of my favorite songs. Am impatiently waiting for the next CD.
5,I never thought I'd be a fan of American Idol.,"I never really was a fan of American Idol. I'd only watch it to see Simon tell how bad the people were. Then I decided to watch the 2nd season for the heck of it. I'm glad I did.Clay is such an amazing singer. He's voice is so.....I can't really think of the word, to admit, but I get goosebumps! It's so ""entrancing"", in a way. The only bad part about this single was, yes of course, the choir was a bit overpowering but I'm really glad I got this single. I look forward to more from Clay!"
5,He is so good!!,This young man is really going somewhere....the cd is wonderful.Finally a real idol for America!!
5,Clay is great,"I think Clay should have won. I love this CD. His voice is clear and beautiful, and perfectly executed. I look forward to more."
2,Clay got shafted,"I am so disappointed in this CD. After the live performance of ""Bridge"" I was speechless. ""Bridge"" is one of those songs I would never willingly listen to again, it's been done to death. But Clay made it new, and his own song. Unfortunately, that magic and his wonderful voice, were not captured on the CD. It is overprocessed. Clay's voice gets totally lost in the soaring violins and the back up choir drowns him out. This young man can sing (!!!), but you would never know it by this recording."
5,"What ""Simon Say's"" isn't always correct!","What does Simon know! How dare he say Clay is ""more suited for Broadway""! Simon does not speak for everyone, that goes out to Randy & Paula as well, you're supposed to be the ""professionals"" in this business but WE-the consumers know what we like and WE LOVE YOU CLAY! It's been said before time & time again, but his vocal ability is just AMAZING, I cannot believe that Clay hasn't had any professional vocal training, he comes off sounding like the true professional that he is! I love this single and can't wait for his full length CD! Excellent job Clay! Everyone get out there and buy this single, it'll blow you away."
5,This is what American Idol is all about,"This single is great and really shows off Clay's great voice. 'This is the Night' sounds better than it did on the show. My only complaint is that the choir in 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' is too loud. I didn't buy the CD to hear them sing, I bought it to hear Clay. Overall though, the song still sounds fantastic and I'm sure both we be hits. I can't wait for Clay's full album to come out!"
5,Only One Small Problem!,"Both of these songs are incredible. ""Bridge"" has a bit too much choir in it, but nonetheless--this song can be played over and over again to pick up on the nuances. Also, it you've ever heard the ""Elvis version"" of ""Bridge.."", it sounds a bit similar, and has a little ""marchy"" tone to it. ""This is the Night"" sounds strong and heavenly. It hits all the right neurons in the brain--incredibly pleasant! Only one small problem--the CD is too short! Leaves you wanting more!"
5,"Come to England, Clay!","I first heard Clay sing on the wildcard show on ""American Idol"" and fell in love with his voice immediately. I couldn't vote for Clay (being from England!) but watched every show until he was robbed in the final. His voice is truly stunning and is showcased fully on these two incredible songs. I cannot wait for his album.If only our idols were as good as this!"
4,Clay is my American Idol...,"...Now my comments:1. Bridge Over Troubled Water- I think that his recording of this isn't quite as strong as the emotion of the live performance. It sounds like he wasn't permitted to record it to perfection. A very good performance, but I liked his live performance better.... his voice is drowned out by the chorus at times.2. This is the Night- This is actually better than his performance on the finale. His vocals are clean, the lyrics and music are very pop-oriented. I think this is the stronger of the two recordings.Overall, I really hope that Clay chooses the more difficult path of recording music in the style of Josh Groban- live music, great heartfelt lyrics, allowing for free range of vocals and focus on the incredible instrument that his voice is."
5,He Touches the Soul!,this single is breathtaking. His magnificent voice touches your soul. His cd Measure of a Man is another electrying experience and Solitaire what can I say AWESOME. Clay Aiken is a superstar with a magnificent voice that reaches out and grabs your very soul.
5,The Best New Talent in YEARS!!,"Clay Aiken stands out among the hundreds of singers that record each year. His ability to embrace you with his voice is truly awesome. Whether you are 8 or 80, you won't be sorry with this CD. People will be talking about this young man for many years to come!"
5,The Real American Idol,"Clay is definitely at his best with these two songs. His voice is superb, as usual. Rueben has nothing on Clay. His voice does not come close to the powerhouse voice of Clay. If you want to hear a real American Idol and some great songs, this is the c.d. for you. Don't be fooled by Ruebens title because Clay is the better man."
5,That Voice is Something SPECIAL!!,"There are a lot of people out there who sing, but few who have a voice that is really something special.Clay has the ability to draw you in and make you FEEL and EXPERIENCE the song. He burns a song into your heart. You find yourself hanging on every note, every inflection. The song comes alive and you don't just listen to it, you experience it emotionally.These songs are just a taste of what Clay has already given us, and a preview of great things to come. Can't wait for the full album."
5,Clay Rocks My World,"Who ever would have thought that the misfit from American Idol would become the greatest pop sensation the world has seen in over 10 years? His voice is shattering and strong, perfectly flawless. I cannot think of any other artist I would rather listen to. Beautiful work, Clay!"
5,My Idol,"The Power in his voice peaks at times with these songs. This is the night is sung with Passion and heart felt Emotion. Bridge just is a great song and to quote many judges from AI you wonder where this voice came from. All I know is I am glad I found it, America got it wrong, but Clay fans got it right. This a great 2 song CD and comes highly recommended"
5,Clay's biggest fan,Both songs are great simply because Clay's voice is so amazing. Can't wait for his album to come out.
5,Amazing New Talent,"Having watched American Idol 2 and seeing the metamorphasis of Clay, from the nerd to a pop star, I am amazed.Clay's voice is magnificent and will surely become more so as time passes. ""Bridge Over troubled Water"" is good but my preference is ""This Is The Night"", passionate and with much emotion, this song is perfect for Clay to perform as his first single."
5,Best Thing That's Come Along In Many Years,"If you have to be a teeny bopper to like Clay,then I'm A 62 year old teeny bopper.His voice is like a taste of heaven to the soul.I can't wait to get his album. It's very obvious that he is the real American Idol.Elvis was the thing in my young days,but clay has reached my heart and soul. I love you clay. You will go far in the music world. The very best of the best."
5,tears to my eyes,I was cheering for Clay since his audition on AI. The quality of his voice and his ability to belt out a song the way he does gives me goosebumps. His performance of BOTW brings tears to my eyes everytime I hear it. He is truly my American Idol.
5,Another Star is Born,"When he came on the AI set in Atlanta, I thought - not another geeky nonsinger. He opened up his mouth and my jaw dropped! I have not felt this way about a singer since Paul McCartney.'This is the Night' is the perfect first song for Clay. Schmaltzy and lovely with enough emotion to get your heart going. This young man has a voice to die for.As for 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' - I love it! I love gospel singers and I really like the choir. Clay's low notes are wonderful and he should sing in that octive more often.All hail the birth of a new STAR!"
5,Clay is a star!,Clay Aiken is one of the best singers. He has a wonderful voice and these 2 songs TOTALLY show his vocal talent! This is ABSOLUTELY worth your money! You won't be disappointed! Buy Clay's single and have a blast listening to it!! CLAY IS THE BEST!
5,Instant Success,Clay came out strong for the first CD. His voice is unbelievable! I would recommend this to anyone for it truly spans the generations. Thanks for a great CD Clay!!
5,The REAL American Idol!,"Clay Aiken rules! This single is just a preview of the amazing career that awaits Clay. I think he should've won AI2. He does ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" better than anybody could ever do. L8er!"
5,Goose Bumps,Clay Aiken's voice is so amazing! Everytime he opens his mouth and sings i get goose bumps all over. He is truly talented and deserves all the support he can get. Amazing Amazing Amazing!!
5,Anxious for Aiken's Album,"There may only be 2 songs on this CD, but they are both AMAZING. If you thought the performances on live television were good, you should hear the perfected versions of these songs on the CD. This CD makes you anxious for Clay's soon to come album.1. Bridge Over Troubled Water - This song fits him so well. His voice grows deep at times which for girls seems really sexy! His range is showed incredibly well too. It's upbeat and uplifting. Great!2. This is the Night - This is an amazing, slow song (yet not too slow. The lyrics are beautiful and Clay sings them beautifully. The last note is heavenly.Ok so this review may be coming from a girl who's crazy about Clay, but let me tell you something, he brings out his voice like never before on this CD. I'm not getting all wrapped up and giving him praise out of nowhere, his single demanded it!"
5,Clay can do no wrong,*THUD* That's the sound of me hitting the floor after hearing Clay's beautiful voice.
5,true american idol,"this cd is great, clay proves he is the true american idol with his one of a kind voice."
5,"Clay Aiken, our American Idol","Clay Aiken is the voice that America fell in love with. His vocal strengths shine through on this incredible CD. ""This Is The Night"" is a powerful pop ballad that will take it's place with the best of all time and ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" has never sounded better. Clay's rendition gives me chills and every time I hear it I flash back to the AI2 Final and remember how amazing it was and how America couldn't stop talking about it the next day. I just can't stop playing this CD. It has been going non-stop since I received it. In fact, it's playing right now. :)"
5,NC is SO PROUD of this NEW STAR,"Clay has a most unique, clear voice of an angel. This CD will convience anyone that he headed for the top. He is second to NONE and I can't wait for a full length CD to come out. Even though there are only two songs on this you will play them repeatedly. It will be the best money a music lover could spend.As a North Carolinian, we are so PROUD of you, Clay. Now we can share you with the rest of the world."
5,The MOST talented contestant on American Idol 2!,"Many of the people who claim that Clay sounds like a Broadway singer have never even been to a Broadway show. They just jumped on the bandwagon that was started by the acerbic American Idol judge Simon. Simon must be partially deaf because Ruben Studdard sounded hoarse during the last month of the show and not once did Simon say anything about Ruben's deteriorating voice quality. All Simon did on the show was criticize Clay. In spite of Simon's criticisms and Ruben's win, Clay had the upper edge. More copies of Clay's single were sold than Ruben's single. And that's what matters in the music industry. A lot of people have good singing voices, but that doesn't mean that their records will sell.Clay's voice is unique and powerful, and it's clear to see that he will have a successful long-term career. He may not have won the American Idol title, but his record sales prove that he is the winner after all."
5,Second To None,I personally think this is going to be the best new performer we have had come along in a long time. Clay has a voice that brings chills. I could listen to this Cd over & over. The arrangement is outstanding!
5,Clay Aiken Wows the World,"This young man has one of the most beautiful, soothing, heartfelt voices I have ever heard in my life. ""This is the Night"" literally gives me goosebumps and brings me near tears because Clay makes you feel the song. His voice is so full of emotion and strength. You can tell he puts his soul into his music. I will buy anything this man releases just to hear that sweet sweet voice. Praise God for the gift he has given to Clay and that Clay has chosen to share it with us."
5,AMAZING,This CD deserves a 5 star rating! Clay's voice is amazing; capturing us all! This CD is a must buy!
5,THE BEST!!!!!!!1,"I LUV CLAY SOOOO MUCH, AND THIS IS JUST THE BEST ALBUM!!IT CAN ONLY GET BETTER, I'M OFF TO PREORDER MEASURE OF A MAN!!!"
5,Clay Aiken Rules!!,Clay Aiken's amazing voice is so magical and musical. Buy this CD single; you will definitely not be disappointed. His soaring voice will make you feel so alive. Clay Aiken is the real deal.
5,"""AIKEN"" FOR CLAY!","He is the most talented young man out there today. I highly recommend this CD and Measure of a Man. When Clay sings, he becomes an instrument and he tugs at your heart strings. I have never recommended anything on Amazon, but, I had to write in for Clay. ""This is the Night"" will be my wedding song one day - just rips my heart and soul out. He's just an inspiration to me, all around."
5,THAT VOICE - OH MY GOD - THAT VOICE!!!,"What more can I say than Clay Aiken is the most amazingly talented artist I have heard in a long long time or maybe ever in my life! I am anxiously awaiting the release of the full length CD! Two beautiful songs, one beautiful voice, and plenty of chills to last you a lifetime! This baby is going on AUTOPLAY!!!They won't be making anymore once all copies are bought - so get yours and decide for yourself!!"
5,Totally Awesome !,"Sing on Clay Aiken !!! After listening to this CD time and time again I still yearn for more. Can't get enough of his soothing voice. Clay has won me over and became my all time favorite artist with his version of ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"". Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!"
5,"Great Songs, Wonderful Singer","Clay Aiken definately made his mark with these singles. Bridge Over Troubled Water is everything a cover should be, bringing the classic into a more contemporary arrangement, while still retaining what made the song lovely. His voice shines from every low verse to the soaring chorus...and that last note is magnificent. At first I considered the choir too loud, but I've grown more accustomed to it, and I think they are a magnificent support/backup, and really, there is no way to drown out that Voice.I was surprised by how much I enjoyed This is the Night. It's a sappy song, with trite lyrics, but...somehow it works. In Clay Aiken's hands the ballad shines and moves me. I couldn't imagine it in the hands of another singer. With this song, Clay soars. I am in constant awe of that voice, and I await the coming album with baited breath."
5,Fabulous!!!,"Clay Aiken has a voice that is a true gift. When he sings you cannot help but pay complete attention. Paula was definitely right when she said that when Clay sang ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" it was like you heard it for the FIRST TIME! ""This Is The Night"" is an original song and is truly worthy of being a number one hit. Unbelievable how someone with such an incredible voice could have been unnoticed until now. Can't wait until Clay makes a complete album!!! (RCA-Claymates are achin' for a special Christmas CD also!) Definitely a must buy single!"
5,Aiken for more Aiken,"Just wanted to drop by and say that Clay is amazing...his voice brings me to tears and makes me smile...he is truly a star. Thank God for him auditioning, or the world wouldn't be so lucky right now. I love this CD and I cant wait unitl his full album comes out and then hopefully a Christmas CD. You can never get enough of Clay Aiken...his is a voice you could never tire of. GO CLAY!!!!"
5,Clay has a powerful voice!,"I just rec'd my Clay Aiken single and just love ""This is the Night"", BOTW was good but the background singers and music really took away from Clay's powerful voice, hopefully they will tone that down and feature more of Clay's wonderful voice on his upcoming album (CD). No matter what Clay sings its dynamic and powerful. Can't wait till I can pre-order his full length CD!!!!"
5,AWESOME,"What can I say, after the wild card show, Clay became my 2nd favorite. My first favorite is Joshua Gracin. I DO NOT have any regrets on buying Clay's album. I love both of the songs. But, what I love about Bridge Over Troubled Water is the power he has in his voice. This is the Night is just a beautiful song all around, I love everything about it. I definately recommend this album. Oh yeah, I can't wait for his album. :-)"
5,Wonderful,"I was a huge AI2 fan - and rooted for Clay the entire season. I think Clay taps into a new market for ""popular"" music. This is the first CD I could classify as ""pop"" that I have purchased in five years (and I can't wait to buy his full length CD). I am so tired of the music industry forcing untalented Brittany wanna bes down our throats. Clay is talented - and has a voice that gives the listener goose bumps. He should have a tremendous career! GO Clay!"
1,A Waste of Money,"Don't waste your money. Clay is alright for show tunes, but I couldn't bare to sit through a whole CD of his singing. He tries too hard. There's no natural talent involved. I can't understand why he has a single out and I shudder to think he is working on an entire CD."
2,Only For The Most Rabid Of Fans,"I have to admit, I was never a Clay fan. I was all about Trenyce all season. However, Clay's talent was undeniable. However, this CD is truly a poor showing. The cover of Bridge Over Troubled Water is just not nearly as good as the original. This Is The Night is annoying and uninspiring. If you're the type of person who'd buy Clay's used gum, then go ahead. For the casual fan, I can't recommend this CD."
2,Clay Is Nothing Special,"The voters got it right hun when they voted Ruben as the American Idol. Clay Aiken over sang both of his songs and he is better suited for a Greenwich Village Cabaret Bar. Also, I could definitely see this young man on Broadway huns. Clay is nothing special huns."
1,Not fit for the modern scene,"yes Clay aiken does have an impressive voice but lets all face it. he will never ever make it onto mainstream radio. his voice is 100% set for the stage and he will make it extremely far on broadway. yes, that right, i said BROADWAY not BILLBOARD. its an ok song but i doubt ill here it on the radio while in such places as NYC or LA which pretty much decide what is played through out the rest of the country."
2,Let's Do a Simple Reality Check,"Clay is certainly a competent singer. However, let's put this entire thing in perspective. Listen to Elvis' cover of ""Bridge over Troubled Water"" from The Essential 70's Masters Set disc 3. Elvis' singing is transcendent and defines greatness. Clay is simply average in comparision."
1,Sounds like a female broadway singer,"Clay is a nice person, but sounds too much like a girl with the high notes. Gets very tiresome. I think people are giving him indeserved hype because he is such a super nerd. And today nerds are cool. I wish he would use a deeper voice like his first audition. That was impressive. This certainly is not.I do think Ruben is better. I also think Trenyce was the beauty, voice and stage performer who could have really flew up the charts. I think that Julia Demato has an incredible beautiful voice and the look that could have took her places. Though she fell short on stage. Listen top her on the American Idol II CD. Breathtaking.I won't buy Clay's new CD. I don't think I could listen to it more than once. He is no Ruben."
1,Clay is a flash in the pan. Ruben has staying power.,"Unfortunately, this guy does not do the classic Bridge justice. Way too much brass is laden on what should be an elegantly simple song. And the original song is sappy and juvenile. The real talent lies with Clay's competitor for sales, Ruben Studdard. Ruben is the artist from AI with flawless talent, mature style, and crossover appeal. Ruben'll still be around after this media circus has folded it's tent."
1,i'd rather listen to yani,"my title says it all... to say someone is bellow yani, is pretty much shameful..."
1,Would Give It A Zero If I Could,His voice sounds awful on CD. He should go on broadway although is acts and looks like a woman. I don't see much potential here. I would give it a zero but the lowest rating is 1.
3,A little boring,"I bought both CD's (Clay and Ruben )because I like Ruben's style but I like Clay's vocals. He really has a strong voice but throughout the CD I was waiting for something to click so that i would want to play it over and over again. That never happened. I was waiting for more but for some reason the CD just didn't do it for me. I tried to be objective and listened to it three times but this CD left me feeling like something was missing. I hope that his full length CD will be more interesting and something I would like to listen to in my car. I hate to agree with Simon but his voice really is Disney or Broadway. Not a bad thing if that is what you are into. Overall, Clay can sing and very well but this CD just wasn't what I expected."
2,Whats so good about Clay?,The cd is ok. That is it. I think his voice is kind of shrillyand too high pitched for my ears. I do not think it is anything special from my taste. Liked Rubens voice better.
1,What!!,What a wanker!!This is for people who like celine dion and now they have the male version to torture their boyfriends with. God help us all.
1,It irritates my ears!,Please don't sing a song of the legendary Simon and Garfunkel. You wrecked it Clay. Simply BAD!
1,Let's Get Real,"If Clay Aiken were appearing in a club somewhere, say in New York City, without the added advantage of having appeared on nationwide television -- how many people would actually go and listen? I wouldn't and I still don't. Technically, he is fine -- he can hit the notes and he obviously knows how to use his voice. But, I don't believe a word he is saying/singing because it doesn't sound or feel authentic to me at all. A real singer is a kind of actor -- someone who draws you into an experience to move you. What Clay Aiken does is the vocal equivalent of putting varnish on a soulful unpainted wall. It's all show and no substance. Real singing isn't about hitting notes, or belting out tunes, it's about really going deep into what makes the experience of being alive ""song"" worthy. He is the victim of everything wrong about celebrity and fame in this country. He is not an artist. Everybody likes him because everybody ""saw"" him."
2,good voice--bad recording,"Clay has a wonderful voice--unfortunately. the producers of the recording did a terrible job of mixing. The orchestra and background singers are so loud that that his voice, muffled to begin with,is hard to hear. It is obvious that they wanted it on the market ""asap"" regardless of the qualiyy it deserved."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE WORST CD SINGLE EVER. HE CANNOT SING AND ANYONE THAT SAY'S HE CAN.. OBVIOUSLY CAN'T HERE.I SENT MINE RIGHT BACK FOR A REFUND. NO ONE HERE WANTED TO EVEN HAVE IT FOR FREE. WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS? PLEASE DO NOT WAITE YOU TIME AND MONEY ON THIS TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Smooth,Clay's voice is smooth and enticing. I really enjoyed listening to the quality sound of the music.
5,So glad I bought it!,"Just got my cd today after ordering on June 12. It was worth the wait! I haven't bought a single since I was in high school. Twenty plus years later I felt compelled to buy this one. I don't know what is about him, but you've gotta love Clay. Big ears, big feet, big heart, HUGE voice & all!I think I should have bought a couple more cds because this one will get worn out soon. I liked the songs equally well, and the choir on 'Bridge' didn't bother me at all. It's a beautiful, uplifting song that Clay makes extra special. 'This is the Night' is a pretty song that you end up singing along to.Clay's full length cd should be great. He can sing the heck out of anything."
5,Clay's My Idol,"Although ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters"" has never been my favorite song, I like the way Clay does it. Can't wait for his complete CD to be out. What a voice!!"
4,"Fabulous singing, poorly mixed recording","As a professional in classical music, my friends and colleagues couldn't believe how I could become so thoroughly hooked on this season's American Idol. As a voice teacher I enjoyed critqueing each performance with my nine year old son. I eventually became a Clay-maniac, and was crushed in the end that Clay didn't win. I told my husband that I now know how it feels to have one's team lose the World Series. I bought both Clay's and Rubben's single cds last week. They are both fabulous, but I am dissapointed that the gospel choir track on Clay's cd is so overpowering. On Rubben's cd, the choir is properly ""in the background."" On Clay's cd, it's as if Clay became a part of the choir. Conspiracy?"
5,MUST BUY THIS CD!,"Do the world a favor and just buy as many copies of this CD and pass it along. Even strangers you do not know. Both songs are so good that it just leaves you wanting more. His voice is a gift and his talent is unmatchable to anyone out there right now. To think he didn't even win! But who's winning now considering how bad Ruben's single is. And to think, I loved both oF these guys during the show. GO OUT AND BUY THIS CD NOW!!I ONLY WISH I COULD GIVE IT MORE THAN 5 STARS."
3,more clay....less background,i just rec'd my cd....clay's voice is great..that is the reason i bought the cd....to hear clay's voice...not all those( too loud )background singers voices.....they totally messed up bridge over troubled waters......the chorale director needs a hearing aid....they completely blocked clay's voice on the majority of that song.. This is the night...was a lot better...it does get 5 stars....you could hear clay great.....please do better on the album.....i want to hear clay....clay.....clay.......not those other yelling people.....please......with a voice like clay has...no background ..backup is needed.!!!
5,The BEST!!,"I am sooo glad I bought Clay's single. It made me an even bigger fan! AND it made my mother a fan too when she heard it. She wants more Clay now just like I do.The songs are beautiful - just perfect!! I do hope Clay can chose some songs to be on his debut CD. From what I have read & seen about him he has great taste in music. Clay has such a unique and lovely voice! I was surprised that I loved his sound so much to be honest, just because I have never been a big fan of most male singers. But Clay Aiken is the whole package no matter what anyone says: he has the looks, the VOICE, and the fantastic personality! Clay seems to be a great & humble person. Those qualities just made me love him more! I wish I could give this an even higher rating. Get it & you will not regret it! WONDERFUL JOB CLAY! I really love you!!!"
5,Clay is my American Idol!!,"I see Reuben dropped out of the top 10. Not to my suprise!! Clay has the talent. Reuben may have been more marketable to Fox, but Clay was the true winner!!!!! I can't wait for his album. The single was just a little taste of what is to come. I feel great things are in his future!!!"
5,Awesome,"Clay Aiken has proven that he has the voice to become a star. He might not be the next Justin Timberlake or Ricky Martin, he does have a sound of his own. He voice is as strong as any other male artist out there today. He will be successful. Bridge Over Troubled Water gives me chills each time I hear it. It is my favorite song when I was growing up."
5,"Wonderful, Wonderful,Wonderful","That's all I can think of to describe this new CD by Clay Aiken. Both songs are sung beautifully, with just enough emotion. Bridge is a truly distinct interpretation of the original Simon and Garfunkel hit of the 70's. Buy this CD as soon as you can."
5,What an instrument,"Clay Aiken is a true talent...and has proven that to be a pop star...looks really don't matter...its the talent that carries an individual..His rich deep tenor, sliding easily between octaves is a flawless instrument..While ""This is the Night"" could be classified as a typical bubble-gum pop ballad, Clay Aiken has taken the song to a completely different level...And while ""Bridge over Troubled Water"" will always be remembered by Simon and Garfunkle...Clay has added a new dimension to the song based on the new and updated arrangement..I hope that the powers to be at RCA records takes the time and effort to guide Clay's career and allow the instrument to mature and thrive in the trecherous waters of pop music..."
4,Swooning for Clay,"I absolutely adore this young man's presentation, style, and singing abilities. He is a sheer delight to listen to as well as to watch. [And nobody seems to mind that wink except for Simon!] ""This Is The Night"" is a terrific movie-like theme -- uplifting, orchestrated and sung beautifully. Both Randy Dawg and Paula were clearly in a coma the evening that he introduced the song. How sad for them because it is a great song sung by a clearly talented young man who rose above the judges' self-importance. Clay's dulcet tones are background in ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters"" as the balance seems to be in favour of the Gospel singers or perhaps its my humble equipment. But while ""Bridge"" is a good performance...""THIS IS THE NIGHT"" is everything a classic song should be. CLAY is truly MR. PERSONALITY and has the talent to belie the importance of the crown."
4,What A Voice,"Clay sure can carry a tune and make it his own. I didn't watch AI until the last two episodes, but I quickly noticed Clays charisma, sweetness, and lovable sense of humor. The highlight of this cd is half of it -- the second track. I wasn't too impressed with the recording of Bridge Over Troubled Water. Don't get me wrong -- Clay sang it beautifully, but I thought the vocal volume was erratic (a production issue, not a Clay issue lol). Maybe the choir just drowned him out, but I thought he lost the spotlight to the choir in that song. Except for the last note of course, which he hits perfectly. This single is an exceptional debut for any artist, and it really shows us that Clay can hold his own. The music fits his voice perfectly (so all that blah about Clay being only a Broadway star goes out the window). He sounds better than the Backstreet Boys or N'sync and sings love songs better too. If you appreciate true talent and a pure voice, you will love this single."
5,Witnessing the beginning of a legend,"All I can say is... its not every day that you witness the beginning of something big. Something epic. I think that Clay Aiken, the ""skinny white boy from Raleigh"", is going to surprise everyone and become the Elvis of the New Millenium, in terms of fan support and worldwide acclaim.His vocals are kissed by God. The pure tone of his voice and his range is incomparable. While the background vocals are too loud on ""BOTW"", Clay's voice soars above and beyond. This song and arrangement really showcases his range, and the innate POWER of his voice. ""This is the Night"" is a beautiful ballad that uses Clay's voice to the fullest. Every note is perfect and every lyric is sung with heart-felt passion.I don't buy many CDs. But I hope to be buying Clay Aiken's for years to come."
5,Best voice since Elvis.,"I was a teenager during the beginning of Elvis. There hasn't been a singer since that made me feel the way he did, until now. Clay Aiken is a STAR. I love his CD and have bought 2. I can't wait for his album. I am addicted. I am looking forward to more of his original songs. Buy this one and help keep him on top."
5,Little Old Claydie From Clearwater,I'm 74 and I haven't been this thrilled over a singer since the Sinatra days. If he sings Stardust {Hoagie Carmicheal 1929 } I swear I will have cardiac arrest
5,The True American idol,"This CD single speaks for itself. The true star is Clay Aiken and he will blow Ruben out of the water when his CD ""Measure of A Man"" comes out. Fantastic, amazing and unforgettable are only a few words to describe his talents. I totally recommend!!!"
5,LOVE HIM,"I never buy CDs, but I will buy everything that Clay comes out with. He's just amazing. I could listen to these two songs over and over again (and I do). I really like Ruben and Kimberly too, and I will probably buy their CDs when they come out, but to me, Clay's voice outperforms them all. He's my American Idol."
5,Clay has Arrived.,"Our American Idol, Clay Aiken has made it! If you watched the show than you know what to expect, a smooth voice, range, and Clay's eye wink*. And if you've never seen the show, than shame on you! Be prepared to be blown away with Clay's seemless voice, the effect that he has on his audience, his charm. ""This is the Night"", a wonderful power ballod, showcases Clay's urgency and emotion, and ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"", a S & G remake, truly remarkable. Please support Clay, as he is the true American Idol!!"
2,Where did the feeling go?,"Clay Aiken is a mildly talented young person. I was never really a fan of his, though I enjoyed ""This Is The Night"" a little bit. His voice sounds good on that one. However (there's always a however), in my opinion ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" was a VERY bad decision. Please take a moment to listen to the original Simon & Garfunkel version on the song. Note the gentleness, yet subtle power of it. It was a soft, emotional, powerful, career-defining, tearjerker ballad. Now please listen to Clay's version. The cheesy chorus, the cheesy trumpet, and then Clay. They basically took a fantastic song and sucked all the emotion out of it. It leaves me cold. I am sorely disappointed that it is getting as much airplay as it is. The two stars is because he does not have a bad voice. I strongly reccommend that you buy Simon and Garfunkel's classic album ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" in addition to, if not instead of, this hyped-up disappointed."
5,It's Clay...All The Way,"Although the wait wasn't terribly longAt last, I was able to play the songOf Mr. Clay Aiken with the golden toneFor this opinion, I know I'm not aloneI play the CD from morning til nightClay's voice gives nothing but total delightHis perfect pitch, the tones so smoothReally puts his listeners in the grooveMy local Target and Best BuyWere sold out within days and that's no lieAnd now I sit around and waitFor that supposed August 19 dateWhen his album comes out for my listening pleasureTo play during every minute of my leisureIf you're not a fan yet you are missing outBuy the CD and you'll know what I'm talking about.It's Clay...All The Way!"
4,Should you buy this CD??,"When I bought this CD, I found the first track ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" to be slightly disappointing. The choir accompaniment is MUCH too strong, overpowering even Clay's strong voice. It softens the sound of the song far too much, making it sound almost like Clay is one of the choir. The second track, ""This Is The Night"" is soooooo much better! Not only is it a beautiful, moving song, but the accompaniment is perfect and Clay's voice absolutely shines. BUY IT IF: you love Clay DON'T BUY IT IF: you dislike Clay. Pretty simple, huh? It's not a must-have for most people, but for anyone who watched American Idol or just plain loves beautiful singing voices, it's a given."
5,A Phenomenal Album!,Clay Aiken has truly proved himself to be a teacher of many fields and his voice is a blessed gift from the heavens. ^-^ I absolutely love his album and the undying beauty of it has made me find Clay a hero in my eyes. He's such a brilliant young man that so many people idolize. He deserves all of the very best rates for his music.
4,amazing clay,"what has taken our hearts by storm. it's the wonderful and amazing clay w/ that god given pheno menal voice.BOTW is a joy to listen to, as well as the numerous songs that he has sang so well at AI. clay has touched our hearts w/ his talent and i pray that his star will continue to shine for many many years. can't wait till his full cd and hope he tours solo in the near future. i truly believe that we have a new singing superstar."
5,still AIKEN for CLAY!,"Who cares if he didn't ""win"" American Idol? Looks like Clay Aiken will win over Ruben ""I sound the same in every song I sing, but I still get praised for it"" Studdard. Clay's new singles are AMAZING. As soon as I recieved my order, the CD went straight into my CD player and hasn't come out since! I want to say congradulations to Clay for being so successful, even though he was robbed of some silly title, while silly, but deserving. This will show the people over at 19 entertainment that they rigged the show for the wrong person! BUY THIS CD! ITS AMAZING!-Amy"
3,"Nice, but I'm Looking Forward to Better",What this disc does is demonstrate that Clay Aiken can sing very well. But the songs aren't particularly memorable or unique - that's why they're not getting much radio play. I'm looking forward to his album which I hope has more to offer.
3,Good Debut Single,"I have never been much of a fan of the American Idol craze, but Clay seemed a bit better than most I have heard on the Radio.Bridge Over Troubled Waters is the Classic Simon and Garfunkel song which is considered a classic, here we find Clay singing with a choir that shadows his voice, and he gets lost among the others..This Is The Night is a typical pop song, with a catchy melody, but has no substance behind it. However to get noticed and make a start in pop music the song choice is acceptable.Where Rubben failed Clay succeeded with this interesting debut single. Lets see how this #2 fairs in the really world."
3,Very Good,"One thing is for absolutely certain - Clay Aiken has a lot of potential. He has perfect pitch (his use of amplitude and phrasing is also notable) Anyone that begs to differ feel free to respond. It's amazing to think that he has practically no vocal training. With some training this guy could be one of the great contemporary pop singers (as compared to a very mediocre Ruben with nice timbre and weak range and weak phrasing). As for the album - it's certainly not a gem. I personally like this version of 'Bridge' but still nothing groundbreaking. Come on folks, what can we expect? The future is bright for Clay."
5,Clay Aikens voice is AMAZING,"The best song on this CD is This Is The Night!It captures Clay's full voice range and is an absolutely beautiful song. Clay's voice is magic and I could listen to him sing to me all day!Bridge Over Troubled Water is good, too, but to me it seems the background music and the choir singers seem to override Clay's voice somewhat.This CD is a Keeper!I can hardly wait for Clay's album to come out in the fall!"
5,Clay you always AMAZE me,"I just want to say a quick note here. I think this SINGLE rocks and I can't wait for the CD! I get chills everytime I listen to the cd. I listen to it over and over, and its only 2 songs!!! It sounds wonderful and Clay is such a talented artist with a TRULY AMAZING VOICE! Everyone should buy this because I think it appeals to all ages and groups of people! GO BUY IT NOW!"
5,Clay Scores!,This CD leaves me feeling SO uplifted! I get chills everytime I listen to it! If you LIKED Clay on American Idol you will LOVE his CD! He has a rare and unique voice that soars WAY above the competition!
5,the best,"he has an amazing voice!! i really look forward to hear his other songs. Ruben is good, but not even close to Clay.i love it"
5,What a debut!,"Mr. Aiken really delivers the goods on these two songs. ""This is the Night"" is a sweet, romantic song and Clay Aiken's delivery makes you want to kick off your shoes for a slow summer dance under the stars. ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" -- a classic --suffers a little from a choir track that's been added to the mix in truly epic proportions, but Mr. Aiken still manages to raise the goose bumps with his powerful, distinctive voice. I can't wait to see what RCA does with this talent on a full-length CD."
1,Just like any other broadway singer,I dont know what all the hype is about but he is just like a zillion broadway singers out there. Nothing special and I wish I didn't buy the CD because the music is BOOOOORRRRRRRING!!!!!!!!!!.One can go to any broadway show and there will be another CLAY.
1,Waste Of Time,"You wouldn't know that Clay has a good voice, because the quality of the recording's are terrible. The choir and music cover up his vocals, making it nearly impossible to hear him. I say, wait until his full album comes out to make a purchase. Maybe the studio will do a better job of putting that together. On the other hand though, you should still get Flying Without Wings/Superstar, as that is beautifully mastered."
2,Second Place,"""Clay can sang,"" that's a given. He certainly gave the American Idol a run for his money. However, Ruben clearly has the better voice. I think Clay will do well if he was to do a sound track and/or song for a Disney movie. His CD is great for the doctor's office or elevator."
1,Don't Bother!,"Clay was pretty much right on during thecompetition. He sang very well. But the CD isn'tall that. After reading all thegreat reviews for him, I expected better.Makes me wonder the motive behind all the high recommendationsfor buying his CD. Well, I bought it and I was a bit disappointed.He tries to sound too soulful instead of justbeing himself. The music drowns him out tooand it just doesn't seem to come together.It's a bit too much to listen to over andover again, especially after a long day of work.I purchased Ruben's CD first and I was extremelysatisfied. A-1 First class all the wayand the quality and sound is superb! Ruben soundsas if he's been singing professionally for a longtime. You would never know that he is juststarting out. Buy Ruben's CD instead. You won'tbe dissappointed."
2,needs a little more work,"Clay has an ok voice, but it has no style. It is difficult to listen do to its blandness. This is the night is a bit better than Bridge over Troubled Waters, which I have heard others sing much better. I think his voice needs a little more work. He has a broadway kind of style that does not easily fit into the pop world. He needs more strengh and force when he sings. These songs are kind of stiff He doesn't make them flow very easily. Maybe with time he can bring his voice to a point that it can be considered an instrument playing not just tuning up."
1,strongly dislike,I liked clay on the show but I hated the songs he chose to put on this single cd. I was strongly dissipointed at it. i liked Rubens single cd better.
1,Get a guitar and write your own song,"Bruce Springsteen. Bob Dylan. Neil Young. Paul Simon. John Lennon. Bob Marley. These are artists and musicians who labored to become real stars. A real ""reality-based"" show would watch ""real"" musicians do their thing to earn a contract. American Idol ""musicians"" cheapen the classics and trivialize the true difficulty it takes to become a musician."
1,Not pleased!!,"This single is not even worth buying. Clay's voice is too Broadway and the songs are boring. I honestly cannot see these songs being #1 on pop stations. He brings no excitement to these songs like Kelly Clarkson does; therefore, I'm not impressed."
1,Waayyyy Overrated!,"Bought Clay's CD because of all the wonderfulreviews posted here. What a BIG disappointment!I am not happy with it. It's just okay, but notnearly as great as the reviews posted here are saying.The on Bridge, the music drowns him out and it's reallynot something I could listen to over andover again. Clay should be on broadwayor something. Don't know where he fits inexactly, but broadway would be nice."
5,a star is born,"collosal voice--collasal personality comes thru in his music-clay is so unassuming ,no false pretenses--from the first moment he sang in audition for american idol i knew he was going to be a great star. wonderful songs, wonderful presentation, saw him on GMA this am,how can you not love him? the album and measure of a man should go gold. just like frank sinatra ,he will do it his way."
4,"Clay's terrific, but get rid of the choir next time","He does NOT need it, the choir did nothing to enhance the song. Other than that, spectacular!! This married 24-year-old mother of 2 will be buying his next CD, can't wait."
1,I'm baffled!,"To the people who actually bought this: Is there something lacking in the original version of this classic Simon and Garfunkel song that compelled you to actually want to listen to the latest American Karoake Idol winner sing it?? Could you possibly have spent your money on a band or artist who is actually talented enough to write and produce their own, unique music, or do you really have to let the hype machine do its job on you again and again and again?? (Or wait - do you think maybe Clay wrote this song himself???)"
2,Poor Poor Pruduction,"why do they rush these poor guys songs out and then release them with those terrible overpowering background vocal. something that was a low point of American Idol tv show is now a low point of there cds! Anyone who watched the show knows Clays voice can shatter glass, well then how come on the cd we can barely hear him o at times 5 stars for Clay 2 for the cd"
1,give me a break,6.99 for what amounts to nothing more than a glorified 45 record.I wouldn't pay that if it was the rolling stones and you expect me to pay that from some no-body we won't even be around in a year.Ever heard the term Flash in the pan... this is it
2,Showtunes?,Showtunes anyone? American idol he is not and now we see why!! I mean I am from the same town and went to the same school but seriously he is a good singer but not mainstream.
1,Not what I expected....,"I found this 2 song cd disppointing...This is the Time is a very bland and predictable song, seems like it was written on an assembly line...I actually liked clay's singing on it better on the final show tho...when you listen to it on the cd, you realize that the song itself is not good, and the production is very ""blah""..sort of like an 80's ballad...""formula""..As for Bridge Over Troubled Water?? I could barely hear Clay over the choir...I have NO idea what the recording engineers were thinking here..the whole cd sounds as if they put it out as soon as possible just to cash in on the idolmania..I hope they take a bit more time, get better writers and producers for his album..."
5,This is Clay's Time!,I think that the future will a shining star for Clay. His talent is great and I'm a grandmother that loves to hear him sing. I can't wait till his next cd comes out. This one was super.
5,Love this guy!,"While I think the gospel singers drown out Clays beautiful voice on ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" it is still a good song. However, ""This is the Night"" gives me goosebumps. This young man has a beautiful voice. Because I was a avid viewer of American Idol, I can picture him singing this song. Clay is truly the American Idol and when his CD is released later this summer, it will rocket to #1 in sales. ""This is the Night"" has a great beat and the more I hear it the more I love it. I'm already signing it without the CD playing!! I LOVE THIS GUY!"
5,His voice moves me...,"I love both songs; however, Clay seems a bit reserved -- holding back -- if you will, in this version of ""This Is the Night."" When he sang this song during the competition he did so with so much passion. It's almost as if this arrangement was toned down somewhat. I still love it and the classic, ""Bridge Over Troubled Water."" Can't wait for his CD to come out in August!"
5,Finally someone who can sing!,"His voice is fantastic. In this world of untelligible noisy music it is a joy to finally hear someone who can sing. There are a few out there, but most of them are people who have been in the business for years. I also applaud them. Clay's voice, his smile, his delivery as well as those beautiful eyes makes you melt, plus he has a great personality. He is MY American Idol and an asset in music today. He's not manufactured, the guy can REALLY sing."
5,I listen to it all day every day,"I think this CD is awesome! The fact that I can hear Clay every day is just wonderful and it makes my day that much better when I get to hear him sing. However, I have also downloaded all his live performance songs onto a CD and I must say I appreciate his live performances of these two songs better than the CD. Only because the music on the CD is a little too loud and hides his phenomenal voice. But, other than that, its wonderful and I can't wait for his debut album to come out August 19. I voted for him 35 times on the last night and was soo upset that he didn't win the American Idol title. But, those days are over now because he's winning on music charts way beyond Ruben and thats all that matters! Go Clay! You're truly my idol."
5,The 'Real' American Idol,"Clay is the ""REAL"" American Idol and proves it here. Clay's voice is fantastic, even over the ""too loud"" choir. He's definitely on his way!I can't wait for his first album."
5,Clay is the REAL American Idol,This is my favorite CD now...I listen to it 24/7 I totally love it. I think anyone who is a music person and people who aren't music people will love this CD.
5,Amazing!,"Clay is outstanding in every way as his singles prove. I am completely moved by his voice each and every time I hear him sing. Keep the hits coming, Clay!"
5,Goose Bumps All Over AGAIN!,"Fantastic CD...made me want more. I agree with another reviewer that it is a shame that Clay had to compete with the background vocalists at times. His voice is so pure...perhaps next album RCA will let Clay sing without all the background ""noise"". This is a must have CD."
5,THE American Idol,"Clay Aiken has one of the most absorbing, enjoyable and appealing voices that I have ever heard and enjoyed. His clarity and scale of voice is phenomenal and I rate him up there with some of the best artists of our time. I wish him the best and look forward to more of his 'crooning'."
4,Let Clay sing,"Clay has a wonderful voice and is more than capable of carrying Bridge Over Troubled Waters on his own. Whoever orchestrated this rendition did no favor to Clay or the song. The loud, sometimes overpowering choir quiet destroys the mood of the piece. I'd love to hear Clay sing it acapella.As for This Is The Night, wow. It's a beautiful piece and destined I'm sure to be a favorite at weddings from now on. It has a beautiful melody, evocative words, and suites Clay's voice to perfection. Gives me goosebumps."
5,awesome,This CD is a must buy! This is the night is my favourite song and I can't stop listenin' to it! You won't be disappointed with this CD! so BUY it!
5,Takes your breath away!,"BOTW has way too many background vocals--almost drowning Clay out. Nonetheless, this man can sing and it all seems so effortless! This is the Night is a schmaltzy but endearing tune--here's a case where the singer makes the song.Clay has not ceased to amaze me and I'll definitely pony up the money for the full cd! What a heavenly voice."
5,Awesome voice,"After Clay's performance of ""This is The Night"" on AI, I was so moved I had tears in my eyes. SEEING him perform is the only thing better than hearing him. I couldn't imagine he could outdo himself until I heard Bridge Over Troubled Water. I have always loved that song, and didn't think it could be done better than the original version - until Clay. It is even better! If you appreciate true talent, you will love this single and anything else Clay does. He's the best I've heard since Josh Groban came on the scene. He's just plain good."
4,Not an American Idol fan? No Problem!,"I bought this single because, let's face it, it was cheap. I wanted to know what the big deal was, so I bought both Ruben Studdard and Clay Aiken singles. I came away feeling Clay Aiken's songs, both of them. He didn't win American Idol. He didn't need to. His talent is just transcends the whole cheesy AI vibe. He is kind of doofy looking, but he has a gorgeous and sexy voice. Clay's voice on Bridge Over Troubled Water is so rich, deep, and flowing. The only problem is that the choir can be a little distracting. Clay sounds like soft satin on This is the Night. What an amazing range this guy has. All in all, it's a great first start. Music lovers everywhere will appreciate this."
5,Wonderful Clay Aiken CD Single !,Brisge Over Troubled Water is one of Clay's best songs ! This Is The Night is very good also. Any fan of Clay Aiken will love this. I do.
5,TRUE IDOL,"yes rubens single makes him sound better than he did on the show, but that is expected. clay however sounds the same, which is still way better than ruben. clays voice is true while rubens is studio made. the songs are great and with clays voice they are even better. a definate must have for any music lover."
4,Would be a five except for...,"Clay is gifted with such a special voice. This is the Night is wonderful, but his voice is overpowered by the music and backup vocals on Bridge Over Troubled Water. Hopefully on the full album they will let his voice be the main focus, as it should be."
3,CLAY FANTASTIC..... CD not so much,"I agree with some other reviewers that the emotional intensity of Clay's finale performance was not here on the cd, but most of all, the poor production values. You can tell this one was hurried out of the gate. BUT, I still think Clay was robbed of his true title and I WILL be buying the CD in August...."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a huge Clay fan, but his producers really let him down on these songs. Clay sings ""Bridge over Troubled Water"" here way too low and tentatively; the chorus is even more annoying than it was on the television show. The song has none of the impact that it had sung live. It was probably a mistake to substitute it at the last minute. This Is the Night is better, but the arrangement is pure karoke. I hope his handlers do better by his album, although I fear more of the same from a rushed production."
3,Very Good Not Great Yet,This cd is very good not great as the reviews indicate however. CLAY will get better as Reuben will in their careers.
1,Yelling or singing?,"If you like to hear someone sing at the top of their lungs, then by all means purchase this CD. I think he tries too hard. I would prefer to hear him relax more when he sings."
1,Bad Mix Too Bad,"I just received the Clay Aiken-Bridge Over Troubled Water single and there is just too much traffic on the bridge. Unfortunately, the wonderfully talented background singers on the single over power the fantastic voice of Clay Aiken. Disappointing but enjoyable none the less. The producers could have done a better job with the balance."
1,A Complete Waste of Your Hard Earned Money,"""This Is The Night"" is the lamest song in the history of american music, and Aiken's screeching will only add to your pain. America made the right decision in naming Ruben Studdard the American Idol! Ruben you Rock!"
5,Fantastic Is An Understatement,"This young performer will be one who missed the title but his ship will definitely come in. I purchased 5 copies to keep and to share and I haven't been this excited about a single since Candle by Elton John. Love it so much and highly recommend and can't wait to see his live performance. What a joy to finally have a clean cut Christian whose music we won't mind our children listening to. I have to say hats off to his beautiful mom who obviously did a fantastic job raising her son. So sick of the nasty speculations about Clay but know that he has the class to see past all this trash. Clay, good luck to you and your career and I sincerely wish you the best that life has to offer. What diginity you posess to lose, when you and the rest of the country knew that you were truly the winner. You are number 1 and I love you to death."
5,A sign that amazing things are sure to come from Clay Aiken!,"Clay Aiken sounds amazing on his first single. Although there are only two tracks, it is worth it to get a taste for the wonderful music we have to look forward to. In ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"", the background vocalists are a little too loud, but Clay's voice shines through, crystal clear and perfect. Even if you aren't an American Idol fan, Aiken has so much talent, you have to buy this single!!"
3,Promising,"His voice is one of a kind... but he still sounds very stiff. When he sings the national anthem, it's patently clear that he's trying to show off his rich and sonorous voice than singing with emotions. As a result, the whole music is stiff with little kinks that make you worried for him, as if he would make any mistake any time. You could clearly sense the instability of his singing in the American Idol. Despite these, he still can go very far after a great improvement. Hang in there."
5,ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL,"Clay Aiken is a phenomenon!! This CD only proves that the best is yet to come with his full length CD!! Clay is the ""American Idol"" for good reason.....talent upon talent, with humility and goodness thrown in! ""Bridge"" is fantastic and the ending packs a wallop. ""This is the Night"" is equally great! You will not be disappointed with this CD! The only negative reviews here are from Clay haters whose opinion doesn't weigh heavily. If you don't like Clay then don't buy this CD. If you like him, you'll love this CD!! Anyway it would merit 500 stars if they were allowed!Congratulations on winning American Idol Clay!!"
2,Not as good as I expected it to be,"I felt that Clay's voice in the ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" song was mostly overwhelmed by the accompanying choir and was not able to stand out. I had to strain to hear his voice whenever they sang with him. Otherwise, he's pretty okay. Didn't like the ""This Is The Night"" song. Perhaps the producers should've picked another... Clay had sung other songs better."
2,"A great Career, but not a great CD","Ok - I put aside my bias toward this years winner ( Ruben IS my preference ) and listened to Clay's offering. I came away with the same feeling; the correct person won the competition. While it's a given that Clay has a great voice, his ""over the top"" renditions don't give me the ""warm and fuzzies"". BOTW suffers even more from the heavy-handedness of the production than Ruben's FWW. And I heartily agree with Randy Jackson; This Is The Night should not have been released. Clay should lobby for new writers and producers. He deserves better,"
2,Horrible,"This guy is just not a great singer. Beyond that, looking at him makes me ill. I can't understand how this geek has mass appeal, and was happy when he lost to Ruben, who has a better voice and more presence.God help us if I have to see this Archie-comic look-alike in the future. The fashion makeover isn't fooling me. It's just that religious fervor common-denominator nice white boy thing that I guess appeals to the average american. Never been happier that I live in Boston instead of wherever it is that someone like this finds broad appeal.Why should I expect more when my fellow citizens stand behind our crass President who says ""Bring it On"" when asked about the continued violence in Iraq?"
1,I would give this a zero if I could,"This single is really [weak]! Clay's voice is mediocre at best and his cover of 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' is insulting to Simon and Garfunkle. I'll be very happy when Clay's fifteen minutes are over. Ruben has a much better voice, I strongly advise you to buy his single instead!!!"
1,"Ack. Oversing much, Clay?","Apart from teenyboppers and old ladies, I can't see who this could possibly appeal to. He oversings every single note, which is superduper on Broadway, but not on the charts. I am baffled why this is outselling Ruben's single. He sings with emotion and exudes charm. Clay? Not so much. Oversinging and over-emphasizing every note of every song does not equal emotion.And why, why, why did he sing this classic? No one will ever eclipse the Simon and Garfunkel original or the remake by Johnny Cash on his latest.I hope Clay disappears from the charts and reappears on Broadway. That's where he belongs."
1,Aiken leaves you aching...,"It really is rediculous what people consider great music in todays society. I tuned in to the first two seasons of ""American Idol"" and all I can say is, its a good thing that Kelly Clarkson wasn't part of the second season. Kelly is much better than Clay or Reuben. She has a better voice and can perform a much wider variety of music as well. ""This is the Night"" is absolutely awful and no one could ever out do the original version of ""Bridge of Troubled Water"" by Simon and Garfunkel. If you want to buy a great CD, go get Kelly Clarkson's ""Thankful"", Norah Jones' ""Come Away with Me"" or Celine Dion's ""One Heart. Don't waste your money on Clay Aiken!"
1,FIRST SINGLE NOT HIS BEST,"VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS CD. THE SONG SELECTIONS ARE WAY OFF. ALTHOUGH I FEEL THAT CLAY HAS AN AMAZING TALENT, WHOEVER PICKED THESE SONGS FOR HIM DID NOT DO HIM ANY JUSTICE. BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATERS IS A BEAUTIFUL SONG AND CLAY MANAGED TO TURN THIS SONG INTO (AS SIMON WOULD SAY) BROADWAY. THIS IS THE NIGHT IS SO BORING I HATE LISTENING TO IT PERIOD. I PRAY THAT HIS DEBUT CD WILL BE MUCH BETTER."
5,No Troubled Waters Here,"Both songs are great and wonderful to listen to over and over. That being said, the songs would have been even better if the background music were lower."
5,It's the VOICE,"I have never heard a male voice as incredible and pure and moving as Clay's - I don't particularly care for either of the songs on the single(the arrangement for BOTW is particularly hideous - I would have chosen To Love Somebody and Build Me Up Buttercup) but it hardly matters because I'd listen to Clay sing the phone book. It's Just That Good.I'm also eagerly awaiting Kim Locke's album and - don't kill me! - think Clay should have finished second to her. Ruben? He should have been the 3rd to go, after Carmen and Corey who physically hurt my ears. *Charles Grisby* had a far better voice than the vapid, medicore Studdard."
5,Clay is on fire!!!,This red-head has rocked my world with the two tunes recorded on this cd. He has really outdone himself. I'm so proud that Clay calls NC home. Way to go Clay!!
5,LUV THIS GUY,Clay is amazing....his voice is captivating...I have listened to this cd over and over again since I got it in the mail..luv it more and more each time I hear it ...his voice really does give you chills...beautiful...cant wait to buy the album..by the way..I never buy cd singles...but really enjoyed his version of BOTW..and I do not regret buying this one...Its a must have both songs are done beautifully....Go Clay...God bless you..you are a breathe of fresh air...
5,"Great Voice, But ""Over Produced""","I have been a fan of Clay's since the early days of AI2. I love his voice, however I'm disappointed that his first CD was overproduced to the point of having to strain to hear Clay's voice --- too much orchestra and chorus, bad mixing (same with Kelly's CD). I still give Clay's CD 5 stars because when you can hear him break clear of all the background ""music"", it is SO nice, SO good."
5,Who needs the title? He's still my Idol!,"This single is worth every penny! ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" is a classic song that has had fresh life breathed into it by Clay's soulful, gospel-tinged interpretation. The gospel choir was overpowering and distracting at times, but couldn't dim the sheer genius of Clay's vocals. This performance fully explores Clay's phenomenal vocal range, from the DEEP verses to the final high note, which is simply a work of art! ""This Is The Night"" would be a cheesy, easily dismissed power ballad if anyone else was singing it. The lyrics are rather sophomoric and the tune pedestrian. That said, Clay's performance of it is almost beyond words. This is the kind of song that gets stuck in your head for hours, and I find myself listening to it over and over to learn every run and nuance. Clay's vocals on the chorus are pure and soaring, and the bridge is very well harmonized. Add this one to your collection and you won't be sorry! Or, you could add five like I did!"
5,OMG!,"i ABSOLUTLELY LOVE HIS SINGLE!!! i have to say that i'm a fan from the show, but this boy can SING!! gorgeous and voice of an angel (but then again, this is from a fanatic) either way, he's got an AMAZING voice and seems like a decent person. BUY THE CD! haha"
5,this is the night/bridge over troubled water,"i like the song because it's a classic. with clay singing it in his own voice and version, it is so soothing, and it gives me goose bumps listening to it. it is just so great to finally hear somebody that really has the voice to deliver it excellent. the ""this is the night song"" beautiful..very refreshing. of course i have the cd. i couldn't get enough of listening on the radio. waiting for it to come on again takes forever. i love to sing, male or female song, and this song, it's perfect for everybody, young and old. and i rooted for clay ever since he got a call back, and shone to the top. more power, clay!!!!"
5,Clay is AMAZING!,"I seldom buy single CD's but this one is well worth the price. Clay has a style that is all his own. Both of these songs are wonderful! I love the harp in the background on ""Bridge Over Troubled Water."" But my favorite one is ""This Is the Night!""What were those judges thinking anyway? Because all 3 of them said they didn't like this song. As a home viewer, I must have heard it much better than they did. I thought it was the perfect song for the occasion and for Clay's wonderful voice. For an ""untrained"" voice, Clay is amazing! I can't wait to hear more from him and I'll certainly buy his CD when it comes out. Clay's range is remarkable. He puts so much emotion into the songs he sings. His voice allows him to sing in any genre! He'll be selling CD's and singing on Broadway! Even if you've never heard this man sing, I highly recommend this CD because his voice is so fantastic! Way to GO Clay!"
5,A Breath of Fresh Air!,"When I first heard Clay Aiken I knew he was special. I just didn't know how special. The more I watched him on American Idol the clearer it became. His voice is pure, clear and precise. He has amazing range. I love his version of Bridge Over Troubled Water which is not a song that had previously appealed to me. I know some people say that the choir overpowers him too much, but to me I hear him just fine. This Is The Night is a beautiful song as well. Clay did a marvelous job on this as well. He is right on with his delivery. He is one awesome talent and his future looks awfully bright. I will continue to support Clay in anything he chooses to undertake. He has made a true fan out of me and that is not something that is easy to do. In fact I would venture to say that this is the first time I have felt this way about any artist. Keep up the great job Clay. You are a wonderful and special artist and person. Sing on Clay!!"
5,Great singles!,"This is a great first single release for Clay. If you watched him on American Idol 2 then you know what you're getting as both songs were performed on the next-to-last show of the season. They kept the choir in on the first song, which is nice, but Clay's last note doesn't have quite the same impact as seeing him nail it live under all the pressure. Still a great song, though. I think 'This Is The Night' is a GREAT song, too -- I'm not sure why Randy and Paula said they hated it on the show. It's a very romantic ballad that still touches me whenever I hear it."
5,He could sing the phone book & I'd buy 10 copies!,"I can't say enough about Clay Aiken. Love him, love his voice, and I firmly believe he will turn the music industry on it's ear. He's gonna be the Sinatra of this generation. RCA, please focus on Clay's voice and not the background vocals. Still, great CD and I strongly encourage everyone to buy it."
5,All I Expected and More,"I loved Clay on American Idol and could hardly wait for the arrival of my CD. It is awsome!!!! ""This Is the Night"" gives me goosebumps every time I play it. Anxiously awaiting his first full length CD album."
5,"Wow, ""this is"" amazing!","When i was watching the second season of American Idol, i was a big fan of Ruban Studdard and Charles Grigsby (obviously the latter of those two didn't make it close to the top spot), since Charles was voted out at the 11th place, i kept voting for Ruban. But as i was going for Ruban, i found myself much more liking Clay's performance's. On the last voting period, i voted for Clay, not Ruban, and since, i've liked Clay. His single featuring the cover of ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" and his original ""This Is The Night"" first single is amazing! Ruban's ""Flying Without Wings"" and ""Superstar"" single disc comes nowhere close to Clay's amazing vocals on these 2 tracks. My favorite of the 2 is ""This Is The Night"". I am waiting anxiously for Clay's RCA debut, i'm not sure if i'm that excited about Ruban's, but i might pick it up anyway."
5,Clay is my Dawg!,He has an amazing voice on cd and on AI. I had him picked from the day he audtioned on AI. He will be a HUGE superstar!
5,A star who will endure!,"Even though I love this CD, I felt a bit let-down when I first listened to it. It seems to me that the powers that be don't understand what it is people love about Clay's performances: the purity and beauty of his voice. They should be doing everything they can to showcase his amazing voice, and not drown him out with music and back-up singers that are both too loud. I think this album could have been a lot better with more Clay, fewer needless frills. Perhaps it was rushed to the marketplace a bit too fast. But, having said that, I am sooo happy to have this CD and I play it a lot. It's the only Clay we've got right now, and that means a lot. I just hope the next CD gives Clay's voice the showcase it deserves."
5,Bridge Over Troubled Water/This Is The Night [CD-SINGLE],"Okay for all of you American Idol season 2 fans this is a must have. For all of us that tthought Clay should have won you HAVE to buy this. I highly recommend listening to This Is The Night. Let the words speak to your soul. If you are not a CLy fan just give this single a chance. Listen to the words of This Is The Night, you will be a changed person after listening to this."
5,WOW!!! Never disappointed in Clay's voice!,"Wow! Clay's voice is awesome! He never disappoints. I agree with the remarks about the choir being somewhat overbearing at times on BOTW -- but as has been said, that was no fault of Clay's. Hopefully it will be on the album which comes out in August or September... and they will correct the sound and allow Clay to to be heard as he was the night of the final competition.This is the Night will be a classic as it well should be. It is beautiful! Way to go Clay! I would encourage you to buy the CD and buy one for a friend so they can be blessed as well! :-)"
5,superb,I love this album and I can't wait until a bigger version comes out. Clay is an outstanding singer and the backup on this is really good.
5,Joey,"I just spoke with Don Boy (as I call him) on his cell. I'm Joey Scribner and I own ""GRINS & GIGGLES COMEDY"" www.grinsandgiggles.netDon is one of the funniest comic on the circuit and he told me that he had a chapter in there about me. He said he was going to send me a copy but he was laughing to hard to embellish about what he wrote. I would venture to say that it's true because as being a fellow professional comic some really crazy crazy stuff happens out there....WOO HOO! I asked him if he wrote about his ""MIDGET"" experience in Decatur Illinois and he said ""no I left that out""..(amagin that)...Now that I hear he wrote a whole chapter about me I just have to say that I would never do anything like that (yea right) heeeeeeeelol....I'm honestly scared to get my copy. But Don is a very funny and talented man.....And really I'm looking forward to reading his book! I just know it's gonna be a riot! One thing about Don is he doesn't pull any punches!"
3,Identically dressed Swedes struggle to change more than their clothes.,"The three years since the last Hives album has been rough on garage rock: The Strokes are AWOL, the Vines flamed out and the White Stripes embraced Led Zeppelin. The brightest new hopes, Black Lips, are best known for (literally) pissing on their fans. When the Hives collaborated on a Timbaland single and recruited fellow hip-hop producer Pharrell, it seemed like a provocative makeover was at hand. But even the title of their new CD is vintage Hives: It's a cheeky attempt to one-up Metallica and the Beatles. Most of the album, like the single ""Tick Tick Boom,"" sticks to formula: glam, pogo-ing blasts that aren't quite as catchy as ""Main Offender,"" their 2002 mini-hit. The second half draws on their Devo worship -- ""T.H.E.H.I.V.E.S.,"" manned by Pharrell, is robo-funk -- but often leaves them sounding unrecognizable or annoying. ""Well All Right!"" offers an apt metaphor: ""swim across the ocean in a concrete suit."""
3,Very Different,"The new Hives album is quite good, but very different from their other albums. The songs are catchy, bordering on pop - Hey Little World and Try It Again are something you could dance to. Giddy Up and Puppet on a String are barely recognizable as the Hives. They tried something entirely new, and I would say they succeeded in producing a good album with some great songs. Personally, I prefer the old, garage rock Hives, but the Black and White album is definitely fun to listen to."
3,"A mix of great fast songs, and awkwardly strange slow ones.","The Hives past 3 albums were all in your face rock albums. They had a good formula. I wouldn't mind if they changed it up a little bit, but that's not really what they did here. They usually only had one slow song on each album, and the songs were good! On the black and white album, there are about 5 slower/experimental songs that are pretty much downright awful. I can't even listen to them. Giddy up and Puppet on a String are just bland, boring and repetitive. I don't mind slow hives songs, just these aren't very good. With those few bombs on the album, I can't give this more than 3 stars. It does have some classic hives songs though. The best in my opinion would be ""Square One Here I Come"", ""Tick Tick Boom"", and ""You dress up for Armageddon."" Overall though, a little disappointing. Maybe not their least creative, but definitely their least appealing."
5,GREAT!,great album! it came like it was brand new just like stated and i have no fault with it. i will deffenitily will be getting more this way!
1,Globetrotter New Zealand Travel Map,"Desiring a travel map for the purpose of driving, I found this map inadequate. It was difficult to read because the towns were printed in very small print with little coordination of print size to size of town. Generally the city map inserts were good. The map legend or reference referred only to the city inserts so there was no description of roads, train routes, tunnels, hiking tracks etc. I prefer the Kiwi Pathfinder map series or the Wises maps."
3,A decent companion when traveling,"It was a great extra to get sites from the lord of the rings marked. A little hard to follow while driving because of the size of map and so many locations mapped out, a little overwhelming. Not all city areas are shown in detail which makes it difficult to find hotels when smaller road names are not listed."
1,A Woman Standing Still,"If this book is fiction, then the lead character, Sara, seems oblivious to self and takes no responsibility for the role that she plays in the outcome of her life. Her narcissistic and borderline personality disorder wreaks havoc in her world like a tornado in a Kansas trailer park. It appears that the reader is to believe that she has grown in some way during her ""Woman's Walk"", but I saw no evidence of it at all. A better title might have been a ""Woman Standing Still"". It seems as though this book is supposed to have a feminist bent; however, it appears to this reader that if it were to be read by more than the few reviewers listed, it might set feminism back more than 2000 years of organized religion ever could do."
4,A fairly decent porn,"Pretty good porn movie. It is not disgusting to watch, the women are pretty, full and sexy. Unfortunately, some of the guys are are eyesores. On the whole a movie that I would reccomend."
5,"Well-argued, practical, wise","Smith makes an excellent case for a more nuanced, well-rounded understanding of conversion than the traditional punctiliar view. Bringing together biblical and theological analysis, plus extensive experience in ministry, he argues that conversion can take a long time. There is rarely a magical one-time decision that changes everything in a person's life from being totally oriented toward sin to being fully devoted to Christ. Embracing Smith's view can have profound implications on our ministry philosophy, particularly in blurring the traditional categories of evangelism and discipleship.I disagree with some of his denominational biases (CMA), and I am skeptical of his assertion that a rebellious period is almost necessary for adolescents raised in Christian homes. However, this assertion where he pushes me to reconsider my assumptions make his work all the more valuable. Highly recommended. Don't just read these reviews; read the book."
1,Started Falling Apart from Day 1,"These shoes are so comfortable that I had great hopes for their future. However, they started falling apart from day one of general wear. Literally. The heel support cracked on one, and chips would fall out every day. Holes appeared on the top surface (leatherette) and grew into larger holes and cracks. I could not walk anywhere there was wet ground, as the soles leaked. Finally, after two months, I gave up. Two months, Grasshopper ~ you owe your customers better than that."
1,Sneakers,I have been looking for just yhe right color of sneakers for months. The denim color is rich & they are so comfortable.Great since I am on my feet all day at work.
2,"They were cool, until they fell apart.","Well, I did like these shoes, they were very comfortable, and cool, however after just a couple months they fell apart, and the whole back on both of them ripped from the bottom of the shoe, in the denim ones anyway. So, as I said before they WERE nice for a little while, but I wouldn't want to buy them again."
5,"If you really want to know what happened to Stax, read this. If you are an independent artists, read this.","This is a wonderful book. Read at your own pace or skip around. It is very detailed. If you find a part too detailed or not interesting to you then just skip a few lines. The story of Stax really needs to be made into a movie. The Johnny Baylor and Dino Woodard, gun pulling incidents are wild. Al Bell had big visions for the company but unfortunate events (CBS/Clive Davis no-deal and the Union Planters Bank situation) killed the label. That's why companies have Board of Directors.I never knew some of these hits that I had heard on commercials or by newer artists were done by Stax artists.I would also suggest taking a look at the Respect Yourself documentary. That is what made me want to read this book to learn more.Stax the movie would have been perfect for the 50 year anniversary a few years ago. If you make a movies based on Chess Records, surely you can do one for Stax."
4,Soulsville U.S.A,"This is the ultimate reference book to research Stax records. It's a heavy read, very detailed and not a chatty, social book therefore I would suggest reading an alternative one as a starter and follow-up with this for the real research"
4,Great book- but why the small type,"Like the zillion CD retrospective of the more than worthy mighty Stax house, this book is great EXCEPT what nutjob decided to make the tye so small??? I've got fine vision but this makes for an unpleasant reading. Otherwise, God bless you Mr Bowman- and VIVA MABEL JOHN!"
4,Ugly does the job!,"I was at my wit's end with the spontaneous fly ""situation"" that has developed in my place. As a) I live indoors; and b) I have pets, I wanted a solution that was non-toxic and non-horrifically-stinky. I found the answer with these Victor fly ribbons, which even come packaged with a thumbtack for you to use to fasten them to the ceiling.The fly ribbons are ugly as sin--more so when dotted with flies--but they really do work well. I've had great luck trapping both fruit flies and ""larger"" flies alike. Be careful to avoid touching the sticky ribbon with your hands, as it takes some effort to wash off the goo."
1,no flies caught after 3 days,"I have a minor fly problem in our kitchen, so I bought these at Home Depot to fix it. After hang the fly ribbons for three days, zero flies were caught. I still see a fly occasionally buzzing around our kitchen ignoring the fly ribbon completely."
1,zero percent effective,"very disappointed. we hung them all up for 4 days and caught zero flies. even the one over the trash can had zero flies, though there were a few flies hanging out on the wall next to this useless thing.i would avoid this product if i were you."
1,Not useful for gnats,"We had an invasion of gnats from one of our indoor plants - getting them under control was very difficult. I bought these strips to try and cut down on the number flying around the house, but the strips only caught two gnats! These things are poorly designed - getting them unwound and pinned to the ceiling was a hassle. I certainly wouldn't buy them again."
1,not a single fly caught,"not a single fly, I tried everything, I tried in high place, door level, flat surfaces. I want my money back"
1,This stuff don't work,I have it hanging in my kitchen for over a month now. Must have at least 30+ flies in the house over that time span and not one even go near it. The flies in my area must be smarter then yours. I don't know how this item get 3 and 1/2 stars.
4,fly traps,Seem to work well for small areas. I use them to capture all those pesky soil knats(sp?) in my potted plants.
4,Very effective against gnats and flies.,"It caught six gnats even before I could hang it up. The only downsides are 1) not very attactive and 2) don't let it touch anything, because it will stick to everything."
5,Jolly Good,"This recording provides a wealth of British nautical marches played with boisterous excitement. Omnipresent Kenneth Alford marches like HM Jollies and On the Quarterdeck sit alongside one-hit-wonders like In the Eye of the Storm, Up Periscope, and the Nelson Touch. Many of these marches are rarely heard outside of the British military services and are nearly impossible to find in the United States. Grab a copy while you have the chance."
2,so-so overview of GMO,"Mr. Pringle has written the lastest book on transgenic plants, of which about a dozen others were previously penned. He tries to take a neutral stance, but he thinks Mae Wan-Ho, Jeremy Rifkin, Vandana Shiva, Puztai are legitimate scientists, when they are not.Alan McHughen's book is far better as a neutral, objective look.Even if he were more sympathetic to the need for transgenic plants to stave off starvation, the writing frequently doesn't go anywhere. Just when you think the chapter is heading somewhere, e..g, in the one about Monarch butterflies, he takes it back at the end. Several chapters are this way, seemingly building to an alarmist conclusion, then suddenly its, ""Oh, well, it really didn't turn out so bad after all."" Kinda disappointing, especially for over $20."
3,THIS IS NOT A DOG TOY!!!,"While very cute, this tiny critter is not a dog toy, which i found out only upon receipt, unfortunately, and it didnt seem worth it to pay to send it back. Even still, my little hot dog enjoyed pulling the string and watching it shake over and over and over, which was amusing until she ripped it apart shortly after. there are small pieces on this which is a choking hazard so i wouldnt ever allow a dog to be alone to chew on it.it did arrive very quickly though."
4,"Baby, It's a Wild World","Based on Cesare Pavese's novellaThe Selected Works of Cesare Pavese (New York Review Books Classics), this film examines the complex interplay and emotional intensity of relations between a bourgeois group of women. The pervasive cynicism within the novella is concentrated in Momina's character. The film also emphasizes the burgeoning and evolving role of the independent woman. This early work shows the development of Antonioni's unique framing and narration methods, particularly in the beach scene. It's rare to have an ensemble cast deliver such strong performances!"
3,Great DVD transfer of a disappointing Antonioni movie...,"If you are a fan of the great Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni, you have never heard of ""Le Amiche"" and are buying this DVD because of the director, you are in for a disappointment. There are good reasons why you haven't heard of this film! Sporting a great black & white DVD transfer by Image, the movie is an early effort that goes nowhere and is ultimately unsatisfying. While the acting is adequate, and it is amusing to get a good view of Italy in the 1950s, the story is poor and superficial (the film is based in a story ""The Girlfriends."") Ostensibly dealing with the same subjects that Antonioni will continue to revisit in later movies, this one fails to get into any of them with any depth.In summary: The movie gets ** two stars, the DVD quality gets **** four stars. If you can rent it cheaply, give it a try, otherwise pass."
4,Good book,Well written book... important for student pursuing a PhD who wondered about things not usually spoken in an organised manner.
4,Flag is large but can tell it isn't as nice as others out there,"Fits the purpose I want to use it for. The flag is pretty cheap, but for the price it is what's to be expected."
3,"Yes, the American Idol he is","I didn't like this song, but I did like most of the songs that Ruben sang, I love Clay just as much, if he had won I would have been happy for him. Too bad there couldn't be two American Idols. I'm looking forward to purchasing songs written for ""them"" and if I like the songs I will support them. I love both of their music. I'm happy that they became friends."
3,Ruben review,It was a great song. The music video is great as well. I can't wait for his cd to come out.
3,Ruben is tapped!,"I was a watcher of the complete series of American Idol 2. I loved all of the top 10 but, it was obvious from the beginning that Ruben and Clay were the most talented. Near the end, it became apparent to me that Clay was the more obviously talented of the two. Clay can make me tingle in places I didn't know I could tingle! I love Ruben's ""teddy bear"" personality and I grin everytime I see his dimples. Unfortunately for Ruben, I can't see his dimples each time I listen to his CD so, it doesn't do a whole lot for me. Yes, he does have a Barry White/Luther Vandross appeal, but I don't feel there is a whole lot more to his voice and talent. The most climactic performances Ruben can present are just swept away repeatedly in any Aiken song. When Clay belted out the final word, ""Mind"", in ""Bridges,"" the depth to his voice was almost unimaginable. Ruben can sing a sweet and creamy lullaby, but he's no Clay 'Where'd that voice come from?' Aiken."
3,Not bad...,"This is not a bad single....but it didn't do it for me. It's nothing to turn your nose up at, but I didn't feel it matched the quality of many other artists out there. All American Idol opinions aside, I think this CD could have been slightly better produced. The voice was nice, but nothing blew me away."
1,A bit slow,"Superstar is a bit slow. It's got a nice message, but it's a far cry from the original. Flying without wings is no better. I wouldn't recommend buying this CD at all."
1,Questionable Arrangement?,"For anyone familiar with the original version of Flying Without Wings by Irish Boy Band, Westlife, will be sorely disappointed by Ruben's rendition. The arrangement of the song falls flat and record executives are already feeling the lack of enthusiasm for this CD single. The public can only hope that Ruben's full length CD will feature more interesting and original works that feature this singer and his full potential."
1,Enough with cover songs!,"Why in the world did AI not get an original song for Ruben? Both these songs have been done by others and the original singers are much better. The words to Superstar seem out of place when sung by a male singer. FWW is okay but no real emotion in these performances. I hope the producers of Ruben's album are doing something new and original or it will end up in the bargain bin within a few months after its release. As our favorite chef says Ruben needs to ""Kick it up a notch""!"
1,Not what I thought.,"Not the best song. It wasnt bad, but I had hoped for a better song from Ruben. Cant Wait to see what he does next."
1,Booooring!!!!,Hope for Ruben this isn't a sign of things to come! It sounds like he was ready to fall asleep during the song; like he is dragging himself thru it. Zzzzzzzzzzz!
1,Bedtime Music,The music on this cd is not for me. It made me very sleepy. I would never recommend it to anyone.
1,Ugh. Just. Ugh.,"Okay. Ruben has a great voice. But this? is HORRIBLE.Superstar - I really do like slow songs, but this puts me to sleep. I can't even listen to it completely, becuse it's the epitome of enuii.Flying Wthout Wings - I HATE THIS SONG! HAAAAAAAAAAATE. HATE. It has lyrics that are completely nonsensical, and again, it is so annoyingly boring. He is very raspy and by the middle of the song, it is just a mess of vocal runs and ""oooooooh baybee""s. It is so very sad, as Ruben is a great singer, and he certainly deserves better."
1,Way toooo slow,"I bought Rubens cd hoping it would sound great. Rubens sings so dang sloooooow, my goodness, I am not happy with Rubens cd at all. I would not recommend it, some people may like a lullaby cd, then maybe it would be allright. Sleepy now..."
5,Ruben's talent as is big as his smile!,"This single should prove once and for all that Ruben Studdard is deserving of his title!His voice is smooth and soothing.He is an R&B powerhouse.Flying Without Wings is arranged beautifully and Ruben sings from his heart,you can feel it!Superstar,which has never been one of my favorite songs is arranged well and really gives him a chance to shine.He has such a rich full voice.I can not wait for his full cd to be released!Ruben has such a broad appeal he will no doubt be serenading us for years to come.If you can only purchase one Idol Cd make it Ruben's,you wont be sorry."
2,Bad cover version of flying without wings,Westlife's version is so much better...they could write him a new song instead.
2,"Sadly, a disappointment","Ruben charmed me on American Idol with his wide grin and southern charm. However, his talent always left me feeling...passive. I liked Ruben but I never liked his singing.With the release of his cd single, I can only say that my feelings have been sadly proven. I wanted him to release a great single; I wanted him to amaze me. But he never does. Instead, I'm left with that same passive feeling. I just don't care. I'm hearing the song but I'm not listening.Perhaps Ruben's ability will improve with the release of his actual cd. But, until then, I'm still waiting to feel something."
1,READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY,I have nothing against Ruben but if you are interested in this single because you like the song DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION as talented as this guy is he did a [poor job] job with Westlife's song and if you'd like to hear how this song was MEANT to be sung purchase the Westlife version and hear for yourself.
3,"Ruben is great, the songs are BORING!",Ruben has a beautiful voice. Who chose the songs for his first CD single? They don't have a clue. Ruben's first CD single should have been Neil Sedaka's 'Breaking Up Is Hard To Do'. He sang it during the competition and it was perfect. 'Flying Without Wings' is a total snooze....... Have insomnia? Listen to this song. I'm sorry Ruben....
2,Not an American Idol,"Poor Ruben; winning American Idol must have been the biggest day of his life. Now that man of little words is having the biggest flop since Justin Guarini. Though he is number two on the charts shouldn't we expect more of our American Idol? His album is boring. Both songs are sung the same, they just changed the words around. Please don't make a whole album like this."
1,Not a good version at all,"The star is only because Ruben as a good voice. but the arrangement is bad an boring, if you realy want to enjoy this song (flying with out wings) you should look for the original version by the irish band WESTLIFE."
1,DON'T BOTHER BUYING THIS CD,"I'm very disappointed with this boring CD. Ruben sounds flat and has poor range. Ruben's voice sounds raspy, hoarse, and scratchy instead of being clear and refined. He sounds out of breath after one song.Flying Without Wings is a wonderful song when sung by Westlife."
2,Ruben definately 2nd place,"Superstar is great, but Flying without Wings exhausts me. Aiken's single is much stronger."
1,POOR EMOTION!,Flying Without Wings should be full of emotion. Ruben tries to swing through based only on his smooth voice. His rendition of this song leads me to believe that the American Idol producers were afraid to let him and Clay sing the same songs for fear that Clay would give far superior performances of the songs. Can you imagine Clay singing this song?? Would have suited his voice much better!
2,Not the Original Velvet Teddy Bear,"A poor man's Luther Vandross, or Keith Washington. Listen to these two artists (Luther in the 80's and Keith in the 90's) and you'll see where Ruben gets his inspiration and vocal style."
2,Ruben,"Didn't like the single. Was disappointed. Love the song, but not the way it was sung. Tried playing it on two different players, didn't sound any better. I am a Ruben and Clay fan. But, if I had to vote again, Clay would be my choice. Clay can sing Ruben, but Ruben can't sing Clay."
5,NO HATERS - HE'S GOOD,"It's amazing how bad reviews are posted about Rueban but none about Clay. If Clays so golden then he should've won, but Rueban won and he's all that and a bag of chips. They both are good, but Rueban carrys the hold package and sings like an Angel. Clay can sing, needed help with his apperance, and he needed some coaching on style and change. Regardless, I would recommend both singers and their music."
5,Ruben New R&B King,"Ruben's first single has me on a high. He has the true smooth quality of the old time R & B singers, but with his own individuality. This is a rarity in the world of black singers. I haven't heard such a new young talent in years. I am so thankful we still have young artists who want to make a difference in the music world. Ruben has mastered the true sound of this soothing song style. I had thought the true masters of R&B were all becoming extinct, but Ruben's Flying Without Wings has restored my faith in good music production."
1,Slow and Dreary,Superstar isnt too bad but it is just so so so slow. And no point in buying the single if you have already purchased the AI2 CD.....the same song is on there. Flying without Wings was just dreadful on the show. So I wanted to give it a second chance and listen to it on the CD. It is still a dreary and slow song. Why do they insist on arranging his songs so very very slow. Once I think he hits a higher note in the song. Save your money and hope eventually they will give him something to sing with some life to it.
1,Boring...,"I found that this single was extremely boring. Ruben sings with no emotion, and that's a big turn off for me. Clay's single is amazing. Buy that one instead!"
5,This CD gives me chills!,"Ruben is definitely a star! When he performed Flying Without Wings on the final show, I didn't like it that much. After hearing it on the CD I love the song - it is beautiful and the words speak of true love. Superstar is one of my favorite songs. Ruben's cover of this song is great!Finally for those who want to compare Ruben to Clay, please recognize that they have two totally different styles. If you love smooth R&B, you'll love this CD."
1,Disliked Alot,"I really really would not recommend this.. but i EXTREMELY recommend CLAY AIKEN'S Bridge Over Troubled Water/This Is The Night!! And i guess you probably can figure out that im ALL for CLAY!!! And Im telling you, You should go buy his album ""Measure Of A Man""!!! I Love it!! Well I LOVE HIM!!!!!!!!!"
2,Horrible Just Horrible,"While Ruben can sing some, he just didn't show me on this Cd what he showed on the show live. Superstar was not very good and Flying without wings was mediocre at best. His voice does not carry well as a recording artist. I would suggest Clay Aikens ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" instead or Kelly Clarksons new Cd."
5,Flying Without Wings,"I absolutely love this song and I think Ruben is an awesome singer. Hearing and watching him perform warms my heart.I believe he was rightfully chosen the American Idol. I like Clay and I think that his singing is okay,but I think that all the comparison between the two should stop. We should all just be happy for both young men. They seem to be really good friends and each seems to want the other to do well"
5,Flying Without Wings,"The first time I heard 'Flying Without Wings', I could feel my soul taking flight. A hundred times later, this song still has that effect on me. And no one else could have put that kind of magic in it but the man who performs it. You can't go wrong with Ruben Studdard. It's impossible."
5,Ruben is the Genuine Article,This song is a classic and Ruben does it justice. His strong vocals make this song one to love.
2,Kind of boring and blah.....,"Ruben *IS* a velvet teddy bear, cute, cuddley, and sweet,but that will not help in sell more CD's. These songs just drag on and on! He did a better job when he sang them loud. I would download them off of Kazaa before going out of your way to acutally by the CD. I listened to a friend's copy and I am so GLAD I did not buy it. Ruben will sell more CD'S if he wakes up a little. The best thing I EVER heard him sing was ""Sweet Home Alabama""...at least he sounded alive during that one. He has a great voice, but not much pizzazz!"
2,Is OK good enough?,I loved both Clay and Ruben (and Kimberly Locke) all through AI. This CD is a disappointment. I know Ruben can sing but the way they had him sing was boring. Do yourself a favor and get Clay's CD and wait for Ruben's album. Hopefully Ruben will flex his creative muscles and not let producers overpower him again.
2,I'm not impressed,"I'm not against Ruben, but I didn't find his c.d. very enjoyable.....if you only buy one of the two AI singles (and that's all you really need) I would buy Clay's instead."
2,One Word: Nice,"Ruben is a sweet guy with a nice voice, but listening to him sing (and watching him sing while on AI) is really, well...boring. Don't get me wrong, Ruben is great, but I would not recommend this CD. It was nice listening/seeing him sing on American Idol for free, but paying for it? Eh...not worth it. His voice is soothing, perhaps if you want to lull a young child to sleep you could buy this CD as some sort of lullaby but otherwise, his voice just doesn't give the listener chills..."
1,Not memorable enough... sadly,"Sigh... I was disappointed in this single, as soon as I got done listening to it once, I tossed it into my drawer full of old long forgotten cds. I had no desire to listen to it over and over again. Ruben has a nice voice but so do many male R&B singers who are now long forgotten or are not distinguishable among the ever growing crop of R&B singers. Please do not let him fall into this group!! I hope his full-length album will have some great writing and melodies and take full advantage of what he has to offer, otherwise, in the future, we will not see him in the music scene. Please don't hold back!! I hope I get to hear him with Tamyra or Kim Locke - my two favorites - because that could be a HIT!!"
5,Amazing!!,"Without a doubt Ruben Studdard is the American Idol. An American Idol is more than great vocal talent. S/he should be the total package. Ruben's delivery of ""Fly Without Wings"" is an emotional ride that leaves a feeling of such great pleasure. His subtle delivery of a song I've never heard before until now and the results are brilliant. ""SuperStar"" is a heartbreaking plea of love and longing that only a truth singer can convey. Comparison may not be fair, but Ruben Studdard will be be compared to Teddy Pendergrass, Luther Vandross, Gerald Levert and do I need to say more."
1,I was sooooooooooo disappointed...,"Flying without wings is okay...Sadly, Superstar is truly awful, and since it has always been one of my favorite songs, it really bothers me to say I just don't like it! I don't mean Ruben is awful, it's the way they made him record this song that I hate. Ruben sang it beautifully on American Idol, why they slowed it down to the point where you just want to reach into the CD drive and spin the disc to speed it up is beyond me. The song drags on and on and on...I hope Ruben speaks up when it's time to record his album, he is a good singer and deserves better than he got. If you can download the clip of him singing this song on American Idol, listen to it and compare, I know you'll agree."
5,A REAL STAR,I can't stop listening to Flying without Wings. It is simply a beautiful song delivered by a beautiful voice.
5,Flying Without Wings,"I think Ruben has done a wonderful job with this new CD, and I plan to buy all of his music when it comes out. I bought 3 of these cd's and gave one to each of my kids in addition to myself. He is great!! and I know he will go far in his career!!"
5,This CD is a have to buy!!!,"I have been a fan of Rubon's(the velvet teddy bear) since the beggining of the show in my opinion this is a great CD ""Flying without wings"" is a song that gives you encouragement it has very good words within the song.And Superstar is also a favorite of mine as well listening to this song gives me chills. I feel that Rubon is doing a good job at being the ""American Idol"""
1,This guy needs singing lessons,"Ruben seems to lack the stamina to finish a song without sounding out of breath.He also appears to have no real ""range"" of voice. His songs all sound so monotone.However, he has mastered the ability to string out a single note into an endless barrage of saaammmeeeeenessss.I am completely unimpressed with Ruben's singing abilities, while also being somewhat stunned that he was chosen to win American Idol.Maybe he won due to his family members admitting on national tv, that they went into the parking lot during voting time and each of them ""voted"" for Ruben HUNDREDS of times EACH!He sure has learned how to use his goofy, pathetic puppy dog grin that seems to beg for applause and pity to his full advantage.If you want to experience REAL TALENT, take a moment to listen to Clay Aiken's newest album. You won't regret it!"
2,"Not Bad, with Time Will Come Improvement",Rubens effort on his first single isn't too bad. I would still stick with more established artists like barry white or luthor vandross when it comes to sultry soul music. If Ruben is allowed to develop his own style and move out of the shadows of the caliber of the artists previously mentioned artists he'll do much better.
2,REASON CLAY IS NO.1 AND RUBEN WENT TO NO.2,"Ruben has a wonderful voice however it is lost in his rendition of ""Flying Without Wings"" and ""Superstar"".The song is over produced and Rubens voice sounds like he doesn't feel it. There is a reason why Clay Aiken went to No.1 and Ruben didn't, and Ruben is already out of the Top Ten at No.18 Singles and Clay is still sitting pretty in the Top Ten after 4 weeks.I am curious to see what happens when both these artists albums are released on the same week. I think Clay is definitely going to chart higher, as the single. Ruben is very talented but I feel Clay is the real American Idol."
1,Hate it,I believe that he can't sing. All of my friends say that when he sang on American Idol that he hurt their ears. I think America picked the wrong person. I think that Clay should have won because he has more talent and a way better voice.
5,Flying Without Wings and Superstar,"I bought both Ruben Studdard's and Clay Aiken's CD's because I think they are both fantastic singers even though they have different styles. I was very disapointed in Clays CD, it was not as good as on the final episode of American Idol. On the other hand Ruben brought tears to my eyes. It was much better than on the final episode of American Idol. I am glad they both are recording albums because they both have so much to offer to America."
2,Meh..Not My American Idol,"I think Ruben sounds the same in every song he sings.He has no range. I belive if you were to buy anything, you should buy Clay's single. Don't get me wrong,Ruben is a good singer, just think he could be better."
1,Clay Is Better!,I listened to Clay's Bridge Over Troubled water first and i must say Ruebens flying without wings beat it hands down but This is the nite is better than anything rueben will be able to ever produceFlying With out wings well eh it had good lyrics sorry i am a very dedicated Clay fan and was beside myself with the fact that rueben won but o well Clay is out selling Rueben! His Cd has an average of 5 stars rueben only have 4 everysingle one of there reviews was great thats true yet all clays cd has over 1000 reviews rueben has only 400 sumthing! In short Clay is better
5,"Ruben ""Stud""dard","After watching American Idol I was amazed at the voice Ruben has. But how would he do in the ""real"" world? Well, his voice is just as soothing and comforting on these 2 songs as I had hoped. His style may not be for everyone, but if you enjoy Luther you will for sure be a fan of Ruben. Clay may have a strong voice but Ruben's voice is the type that will stand the test of time. It is music for ALL ears. Good job Ruben! You go Boy! Can't wait for a full length CD."
2,Disappointed,"I've listened to both American Idol cds, and came away disappointed with Ruben's. His voice is still scratchy and he oversings notes he can't sustain. The entire time I listen to his music, I can just see his headwagging and pointing his finger and it is very distracting. I found my mind wandering when I listen to his music. Perhaps if better songs were chosen for him? At any rate, this cd did not ""fly"" with me, wings or no wings."
3,It Was O.K.,"I am not thrilled with this CD but I like Ruben. In comparison, I would rate Clay Aiken's CD as the better of the two. Flying Without Wings, while not my favorite version, was o.k. but I would have preferred a different song than Superstar, Ruben can do better."
2,"A little disappointed, good but not great!","Ruben has a very nice voice and ""Flying Without Wings"" is a beautiful song. Personally I enjoy artists with greater range. Ruben is limited to the types of songs he'll sing. CD is ok, not sure I'll puchase an entire 10 track CD."
2,Luther?,"First...Ruben is very talented and very sweet, BUT his ""sound"" is so Luther Vandross-Peabo Bryson that it can be hard to distinguish the difference. Luther and Peabo are a bit more polished, though. Ruben does sound smooth and will be bound to improve with time. I just REALLY REALLY hate the song ""Flying Without Wings"". It drones on and on and gets stuck in your head and drives you nuts. Superstar is much better and at least it is on the single. I just think I will be sick if I hear ""Flying Wings"" another time....blech! I guess I am more into Luther and would buy his CD first."
2,DISAPPOINTING FLIP SIDE,"I REALLY LOVE FLYING WITHOUT WINGS, BUT I CAN'T EVEN STAND TO LISTEN TO WHAT HE DID TO KAREN CARPENTER'S SUPERSTAR. IT JUST DRAGS AND DRAGS. I WAS HOPING IT MIGHT GROW ON ME, BUT I SKIP OVER THAT SONG NOW."
3,Ruben is a good singer and a great guy!,"Ruben is a good singer and an absolutely fabulous person, with a heart even bigger than his persona; I admire him greatly! But... for me, he just doesn't have that certain 'something' that makes me want to listen to his music time after time-- his voice sounds like so many others-- talented, to be sure, and nice to listen to, but without a stand out uniqueness that would compell me to buy his CD album. Perhaps with some time he will develop his own style and distinguish himself from the rest.Good Luck, Ruben-- I wish you nothing but the best, you're a great guy!!"
2,Get Ruben Some Better Material,"Ruben certainly can sing, but this CD just puts me right to sleep. No fireworks, no stirring moments - it's what my 9 year old would categorize as ""night-night music."" Flying Without Wings doesn't do a thing for me, and Superstar is so doggone slow I feel like it will never end. I hope the material they choose for his full length CD is more exciting!"
1,"Terrible, VERY unoriginal........","Ruben's voice is ok, but it is well below any decent Motown singer. Skip this [hopeful] and go listen to the professionals, like Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson. There is nothing new here, very unoriginal."
5,Ruben's Hit CD,I have listened to Flying Without Wings Over & Over. This is a powerful song. I love Ruben's rich voice and the burst of energy that comes toward the end of the song. The choir is asensational addition which only enrich the song more. Thanks Ruben for such a great experience. I L0VED IT!
1,Buy Clay's Instead,"If you are going to spend money on a single, trust me...BUY CLAY'S INSTEAD!! Clay's is MUCH better and will be worth your money."
5,Good CD !,Ruben I love your voice. Keep up the good work! You are my Idol. It sounds like you have been singing for years. Look forward to seeing more of you. Best wishes!
2,Ruben's voice may be impressive...cd isn't.,"i feel sorry for ruben to have such good talent, while releasing a bad single. i can honeslty say that i don't like ethier of these songs...Flying without wings drags on and on and on, the whole cd is boring. neither song did ruben justice. although he's a great guy with a impressive voice, don't, i repeat, do not buy the cd unless you are looking for creative ways to waste your money. clay's cd was by far, better, even though both singles were overproduced. my advice: by clay aiken's single, and wait until ruben's cd comes out."
1,I'm sure he's a nice guy...,"with a nice smile to boot, but his singing just didn't do it for me. The songs just got boring fast. He sounds like there's a huge weight over his chest, resulting in a less than dynamic vocal range. I can't recommend this to my friends...."
5,Ruuuben Rocks,"I love Ruben his songs on his cd single give me the chills! They played ""Flying Without Wings"" at my daughters high school graduation. Ruben is a star and a true American Idol!!!!"
1,Luther or Ruben?,"I admit, Im young and didnt know who Luther Vandross was. But, when i watched the AMAs and seen he had won 2 awards and heard apart of his song, im like Ruben sounds like him!I dont like people that copy other people and i dont like the way he sings honestly! It sounds like he has sumthing stuck in his throat! I dont like too many of his songs and i hate Superstar, i think that is a really bad song. Sorry Lionell! Well, thats just what i think, I would TOTALLY pick CLAY over RUBEN, Clay is much better in my view!"
1,isn't worth 1 star,"This cd is dull and boring - definately music to fall asleep to (better than counting sheep or reading a dictionary). I'm hopeful his album will be better, but I'm not hoding my breath."
1,Just an average singer.,"Ruben does have a nice voice but I don't think he can really make it far. He doesn't have a range at all and always sings the same type of song. If I hear ""Superstar"" one more time i'm going to puke. ""Flying Without Wings"" is a nice song but you can save your money."
1,He's a fake!,"DO NOT BUY THIS! Rugen Studdard is really a evil robot benton world destruction. When you hear it's voice, it hipnotizesyou to like him! But not me! My mind is to powerfull. He reallydidn't win! With all the people he hipnotized he was boundto win! All this is true!"
1,Proving the point,"Just proves my point, they wanted Clay out from the beginning, but a bridge over troubled water stood in their way. Point taken, Clay's the best and should have won it!"
3,we luv clay!!!,"i'll b fair, ruben duz hav a good voice n stuff, n i hav nothing against his looks, n i think that he's a sweet guy! so i won't b xtreme, n i gave him 3 stars. but really, what we want is clay!!! CLAY RULZ all the way!!! his voice is so much richer and more ""layered"" than ruben's, who always stays the same. overall, i'd jus like 2 say ... GO CLAY ALL THE WAY!!! (hey that rhymed, i'm a poet n i dun even kno it ... XDD)"
1,Horrible,Boring!!! His singing is so boring. This song is so boring. If I could vote 0 I would. Don't buy this. His singing is the same run of the mill the Music Industry is trying to shove down our throats. He is not the American Idol!!!!
3,well he's no barry white or luther,not a ruben fan but he was better than scarecrow clay aitken anyway i don't like this song and i expect ruben to be arouind for another year then he'll be anothger memory and comparing him to the maestro barry white is ridiculous.
5,Hot CD!,Ruben you can sing! You sound so much like Luther! Superstar sounds so good. My friends can't wait until Tuesday! I look forward to buying mutiple copies of your CD on Tuesday! Enjoy your success!
5,This CD is Excellent!,"I've purchased 3 single CD's in my life one was Flying Without Wings/Superstar, the other was the soundtrack from the Bodyguard and the other was from another American Idol contestant. I enjoy this single the most and I want my full Ruben CD now. I think I've worn my single out from playing it so much."
4,Soul Brotha who needs more of an 'edge'...,"Clay and Ruben were never my favorites on AI (Kimberly Locke happens to be my fave), but I could never deny the talent that these two guys possess. Indeed, Ruben demonstrates the kind of 60's and 70's soul/r&b that isn't seen very often anymore in young artists. I love soul, r&b, and hip-hop, but Ruben, along with Clay, have yet to record anything modern or edgy. This is the key to competing on the mainstream pop charts. Both of these songs, along with Clay's, are performed very well and are good enough (for now at least). But the hype over these singles won't last much longer. Their next material will have to be more modern and edgy. Huge fans will probably disagree, but this is the truth. Ruben has the potential to be one of the best, but these songs, and others like them, won't cut it in the long run. Like I said, a superbly talented guy (but his songs are definitely going to have a short self life)."
3,Can't overcome poor production,"First of all, I am a huge Ruben fan. I think he has a wonderful voice and is very genuine. I thought he had some magnificent performances during the series. That being said, I was quite disappointed in this CD single. Ruben's voice was and is awesome, but the music sounded like it was done on my Casio keyboard. Especially on ""Flying Without Wings"" the backing music and vocals sounded cheap and tinny. A much better musical version of the song is done by the group Westlife. If they could have put Ruben's voice with that music, it would have been great. ""Superstar"" suffers from the same poor production quality.I think they should have released live versions of his and Clay's songs instead of cheesy, canned, studio renditions. Hopefully, the powers that be will put more time, effort, and money into Ruben's debut CD. He deserves better than he got here."
2,"Love Ruben, hate the song!","I love Ruben and I will certainly buy his forthcoming album, because of his vocal talents. He has rightfully won the American Idol title.However, ""Flying Without Wings"" is a poor choice for a single. The record company should have released ""Kiss And Say Goodbye"" instead.Another thing that the record company should have done is to improve on the arrangement of Superstar - too slow, too boring. Ruben was brilliant doing Superstar on American Idol, but so-so on CD doing the same song. The fault lies totally in the production."
2,So disappointed!,"I really thought this was going to be a lot better. It's not the same when you can't see Ruben. I wish him all the best of luck in his new career, but this is just so weak. It has fine moments, but they are only moments. I thought he was capable of much better and I hope his upcoming album includes some original songs. Clay's CD is so much better."
2,Nothing Special,"Im not A ruben basher, I actually liked Ruben. But, His voice isn't as amazing as it use to be. It's good. But not as good as Clay Aiken or some others from American Idol. Its okay. Thats it"
3,Poor choice of songs for Rueben,"It's a nice effort, but quite frankly not an ""American Idol"" performance. Not memorable. Rueben's talent is so limited, I don't agree he is the American Idol. Get Clay's single instead, you'll be much more satisfied."
2,Ruben does not shine on this cd,"While I like Ruben's voice, this cd does not do him justice. Unlike Clay's cd which is magnificent, this one is just plain depressing. Dont waste your money."
2,Zzzzzzzz,"Yawn--oh, sorry! I seem to have drifted off while listening to this boring CD. Ruben's voice is okay. I've heard better, I've heard worse. I just can't get real excited about it--he's clearly not for everyone. Bottom line: don't waste your money. If you like AI2, buy Clay's CD instead."
1,Nap time!!,Ruben has a nice voice but these songs are just plain snoozzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzze!! Songs you listen to when trying to take a nap. If the album isn't any better many fans will be truly disappointed. Save your dough!!!!
1,...,i expected a lot better. If I knew it would disappoint me like so..i would spend my money on better things
1,Elevator Muzak,"What is the big deal here? Ruben Studdard is a nice concept, but the talent is pretty standard. If you are going to buy Superstar, please buy the Luther Vandross version. Ruben's version is slow and dull. I felt like banging my head against the wall a dozen times. I think I almost fell into a coma. Ruben also covers Westlife's Flying Without Wings. It was pretty stupid the first time around, but Westlife made it work. This is a pop song. Ruben Studdard's got a standard R&B voice. It's nothing special. There are R&B stars with more conviction in their voices. Ruben Studdard seems to be stuck in a rut, since both songs sound very similar. I know they aren't supposed to. It's nice background music. If you suffer from insomnia, this is the cd for you. I'm sure grandmothers everywhere will appreciate this."
2,IDOL???,"Does he have talent? Yes he sure does. He is a great singer, but he should not have won American Idol."
1,What the .......,HORRIBLE!! This guy is terrible! Clay was robbed! This album was terrible. I had to turn it off half way through it. He is a wanna be Anthony Andreson. This is by far the worst album I have evere heard. I thought Terence Trent D'arby and Johnny Kemp were terrible but Ruben takes (and eats) the cake!TWO THUMBS DOWN!
5,Ruben's CD is awesome,Please buy Ruben's CD it is awesome. There are a lot of haters out there who were/are not ready for a Black American Idol. Well stop hating this is 2004. Get ready for the real talent: Ruben!
5,Fantastic!,"I love both songs! Ruben was the right choice and Ilook forward to his album! Clay sounds okay, justnot something I would like to listen to over andover again."
1,Ruben Review,"These songs are ok. It just sounds like all performances i heard on the show. Every song sounds the same, he needs more variety to his song selections."
4,"Nice, but not great","I was disappointed that they chose to include Superstar on Ruben's single because it is already on the American Idol 2 CD and the rendition sounds too drawn out, doesn't compare favorably to Karen Carpenter's version. I was also disappointed that they chose to use Flying without Wings, which was sung by Irish boy band Westlife a few years back. The song seems better suited to Westlife's range of voices, it sounds fuller, not so thin. Unfortunately Ruben's voice sounds tired on both tracks, which isn't really fair to him (let the guy rest up before recording!) or an accurate depiction of his talent. Hopefully they won't have Ruben sing many *retreads* on his new album, he needs to sing orignal songs to be taken seriously."
3,It's O. K.,It was O. K. I mean Flying w/o Wings was great but Superstar was way too SLOW. I prefered Clay's single.
1,something missing,"The charisma is lost when your not watching him perform, his just isn't voice is not enough to carry him."
3,The Velvet Teddybear deserves better.,"I really enjoyed Flying Without Wings. However, I would have liked to have seen something other than ""Super Star"" as the other track. I loved Ruben's live performance of this song, but the arrangement of the recorded Version sucks. I am a Clay fan as well. I was very happy to hear that ""Bridge Over Troubled Water""was going to be his second track instead of ""On The Wings of Love"" Maybe they should have had Ruben record another song he sang during the competition like ""Kiss and Say Goodbye"" or ""Breaking Up is Hard to Do"" I give Ruben five stars and Simon Fuller and his group one star, they are the ones who need to raise the bar."
4,"""Superstar"" Says It All!","Although ""Flying Without Wings"" seems to be the song that has been promoted, as a singer myself, I found Ruben's vocal talents were showcased much better on ""Superstar"". On ""Superstar"", he shows more variations in dynamics and it is a wonderful song! True enough, it has been done before. However, a great song is timeless! Go Ru!"
2,"OJ's innocent, and Ruben is Americas idol!!","Unfortunately, this is a lackluster performance, and almost completely devoid of any real SOUL. The real SOUL man is, of course, Clay Aiken...sings circles around this guy, and sales figures are proving the point. And longevity will too. What a shame AND a sham that so many people ""vote"" their own skin color, rather than talent. Ruben seems to be a nice enough guy, but a nice guy does not a talent make. If you want ""chill out"" music, there's many who do it better, so why fritter your time away with the subpar? Having said that, I do wish both of these young guys all the best in their respective paths."
3,Good Start,"This is a very good performance. The audio quality is very poor but that is not Ruben's fault.FWW is not a great song as perfromed by Ruben, but very good.Superstar is excellent. He sings with conviction and pulls the listener into the performance.The peolple at RCA/J studios need to listen to this CD to figure out how to get rid of the massive compression and pitch correction which takes all the high end out.Let the performance be natural. No Phil Spector wall of mushiness, please. I want to hear the performer breath."
2,"Flying without Wings was Good, but Superstar was Horrible","Ruben did a good job with the song Flying without Wings. Superstar was miserable - it was so bad that I turned the CD off. As the others have mentioned, the song was really slow. If you liked the Flying without Wings song, you may enjoy this CD, otherwise forget it."
2,"Okay, but could have been better.","Ruben is a great singer but I just didn't feel it in these 2 songs. I am glad I only paid for 2 songs because after the first song, I turned it off."
2,If you think this is good....,"I've heard ""Superstar"" and it's not Rubben's best performance. I agree to some listners that they should have choosen ""A Whole New World"" instead. that song brought Rubben...Superstar didn't.As for ""Flying Without Wings""...I was VERY disapointed. Maybe's cuase i'm a Westlife fan and their rendition of FWW is much better, or maybe cause i'm ticked that Simon gave Rubben the song only to have him totally ruined a Westlife Classic (which entered the chart at #1 position by the way). Westlife could have made it big here with FWW but to the States, it's Rubben's song. If you like ""Flying Without Wings"" on Rubben's single, you should really check out Westlife's version. It would definately bring tears to your eyes."
5,I give this cd more stars! 400 stars!,"My mom bought this cd, I was listening to this cd on Sunday at 1:20P.M. So, I can hear the whole cd. I love this cd, but I do not like the background vocals, they should've left him singing it alone without the background vocals. It makes no sense, however, Ruben is better without background vocals. So, when his cd comes out. Pleeeeeeeasee! Leave out the background vocals! That will drag his voice down. I truly agree that the choir in Clay's song ""Bridge over Troubled Water"" should have been left out too. I couldn't hear Clay's voice when they were singing. That's what I was expecting to hear at the end of the song. I'm going to buy the single just to listen to it then I will come back to review it. American Idol production people, please leave out the background vocals and do something with the instrumentations. Ruben, Clay, Kelly, and Tamyra Gray are all talented if Tamyra Gray had her cd out, it would be worth to buy.Buy this CD!!!!!!"
1,Get Clay's,"Lets face it, Clay is the clear winner here. Ruben may have won but sales is what this is all about."
1,not that great,this cd isn't very good and ruebans voice isn't very powerful at all...he is an average singer and the clay cd is amazing because he has a great voice
4,"Ruben Sounds Great , But Poor Production","If you're a fan of a certain TV show, then you know these two songs well. FLYING WITHOUT WINGS is an original tune, and it sounds pretty good. The tone of the song is somewhat gospel-tinged, which really suits Ruben's rich voice. SUPERSTAR is a better song - essentially a remake of Luther Vandross' remake of the Carpenters song. On both songs, Ruben sounds terrific, although his voice is a touch raspy (no doubt he was overtaxed from all the singing they made him do). Unfortunately, the production sounds like it was a bit thrown together. The background music sounds too much like a cheap tinkly piano, and it really lets Ruben down. Big thumbs up for Ruben and I'm looking forward to his full-length CD. Let's just hope that he gets better producers next time."
1,To compare to Luther or Barry is an insult. . .,"Ruben is no Luther and he is no Barry and never will be. Flying without wings is a horrible tune at best (although I would have hated it with anyone singing it, who writes this stuff?). But to hear him butcher a beautiful Carpenter's song is about as bad as you can get. The biggest problem with Ruben is that all of his songs sound EXACTLY THE SAME!!! I don't know why it's taking so long for his full length album to come out considering he could sing one track and they could just copy it twelve times and put different names on them. Buy this CD if you are an insomniac."
2,meh...,"this CD was not the best, but it wasn't horrible either, but f i had a hance to buy it or not buy it, i wouldn't buy it, but clay's is awesome, i recommend that one instead."
2,As expected,"After watching American Idol this CD is about what I expected. Reuben sounds much the same in the songs he sings and these songs are no exception. He has a relatively nice voice, but I prefer to listen to someone with more range of talent."
4,Ruben has a wonderful voice,"While I am mostly a Clay Aiken fan I am also a fan of Ruben Studdard's. I love Ruben's smooth as silk voice and it can be heard loud and clear on this single. The song was not my first choice for him, but his voice sounds great on it. I am looking forward to hearing more from Ruben in the future!"
3,Nice gospel like singing,"Ruben is more of a gospel singer to my ears. He has had a lot of vocal training according to his bio. but he still has a thick quality to his voice that, for me, is better suited to R&B; and soul music as well as the aforesaid religious genre. I am not convinced that he deserved to win American Idol when compared to a natural, exquisitely pure,crystalline voice with a far greater range and power that Clay Aiken has.But I do enjoy ""Flying without Wings"". His rendition of ""Superstar"" with all the ""baby, baby, baby"" words that he repeats over and over does not work for me, although he does show very nice lower register and he hits his notes right on.I wish Ruben well and hope he finds his niche without beingforced to sing hip hop or rap which will alienate a lot of us who hate that genre. Ruben deserves great music to record. I hope his label doesn't ruin it for him."
4,Ruben delivers his typical warmth and grace,"Ruben has a golden, distinctive voice and shows it off to great advantage here. While ""Flying Without Wings"" is a rather weak song (which is why I'm giving this only 4 stars), what I really like about this single is that Ruben holds on to his strengths and shows some growth in other areas. For example, he's eased up on the excessive melisma that sometimes got in the way of his performances on AI.I was never able to vote in AI because I'm in Canada, and although Ruben sang the best of anyone for several nights I still would have given the edge to Clay. Nonetheless, Ruben has definitely earned his recording contract. I'm really looking forward to his first full length CD and I wish him continued success."
1,One word: BORING,Superstar is one of the worst songs I have ever heard!! It is beyond boring..it is not Rubens fault..the version is too slow and there is too much time with just instrumentals. Flying Without Wings is a good song but Rubens version is nothing special. Don't waste your money on it.
1,Sleepy Ruben,"Rubens version of ""Flying Without Wings"" sounds like he needs a nap.The song is excellent, but if you want to hear how it should sound listen to the Westlife version."
2,Not what I expected,"I am not an avid AI fan but enjoyed both Clay and Ruben. I bought both CDs and I must say, I find Ruben's to be pretty tiresome after a couple of times. Clay's, on the other hand, is not. Guess that takes me over to the Clay Aiken side of this debate that's been going on."
5,One of the Best Voices I ever heard,This man has a voice that defies description and transcends all genres. When he sings he pulls you in and makes you feel what he feels sending you to higher heights. Buy his cd and let the Velvet Teddy Bear take you where no man has taken you before. Ruben will be around for a very long time because his voice has staying power and oh so much soul. Thanks Ru for emotionally charging me and lifting my spirits.
1,Mary Hart Is Wrong!,"Watching Ruben Studdard on American Idol, you couldn't help but smile while watching him. He was the jolly fat guy. He smiled through all of his performances(which was pretty strange when he was singing about breakups). As talent goes, he's painfully ordinary and unoriginal. I made the mistake of listening to Superstar after a long day at work. About a minute and a half into it, I fell soundly asleep. I just can't listen to Ruben's voice for long periods of time. His voice put me into some kind of hypnotic trance. Later on, I zoned out to Flying Without Wings. Ruben Studdard has a pleasant voice, I suppose, for the Mary Harts of the world. He was good on American Idol because he smiled a lot. I do not recommend buying an entire CD worth of Luther Lite ballads. What worked on American Idol does not work here. What's so great about Ruben Studdard? I guess you'll just have to ask Mary Hart."
1,boring,"Ruben has a nice voice but could he be any more boring? He has zero personality and this is very evident when singing. Poor guy was led astray by the American Idol judges, they gave him false hope."
1,nothing different here,"i was not impressed with his live performances and his studio performances are even worse. let's face it- he sounds like a zillion other R&B/soul performers. nothing unique in his voice, inflection or styling. all the performers he's compared to ( vandross, barry white) did it first and did it much better. it takes more than a good voice to make a performer, and this guy just ain't got it. buy an otis redding, jackie wilson or sam cooke CD to see what a REAL soulful singer is all about. nobody will remember this guy in 10 years."
1,Huh?,"Ok, the title of this thing is Flying without wings. Ruben couldn't fly if he had wings because he weighs too dang much. His wings would literally have to stretch over city blocks to get him off the ground. The song is awesome though, Go Ruben!!"
1,ruben is not the american idol,"how can he be the american idol when clay outsold him by like 25%, clay aiken has the better voice, the better stage presence, the better personality, and ruben is just blah, this was clearly shown with his album, there is nothing special about either of his songs"
5,Ruben - America's TRUE Idol and Sexy Teddy Bear!!!,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the start of something great! I'm from North Carolina and the folks here are trying to shove the guy who DID NOT win (and was kicked off initially) down our throats. Now that guy does have a nice voice and will do well with showtunes, Neil Sedaka, Barry Manilow, and ""Up With People"" type tunes. But when the lights go down and the ""Quiet Storm"" kicks in, Ruben has versatility with his range, not to mention a soulful depth far beyond his age. The song selections for this coming out CD were okay, but I look forward to some truly great originals and remakes in the future. Ruben, congratulations!! No matter what some North Carolinians say or think, YOU ARE THE UNDISPUTED AMERICAN IDOL!! Folks, let's show our love for his singing by buying his music. You will not be disappointed!!"
1,Ruben Studdard SUCKS BIG TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"OK i dont understand what the big fuss is all about! I hate rubens voice he cant entertan people at all!! Now everyone her knows that Clay Aiken can. Belive me, by Clay's album. You'll thank yourself later. I know i did"
1,One Word - BAD,"Unfortunately, this CD shows why some great performers do not make it. This CD shows how limited his vocal range is. He could get away with that in the competition but he can't on a CD. I can not recommend this to anyone. The songs are so much better when sung by the original artists."
3,There are two basically opposite ways to produce an artist:,"Method#1/Listen to him, understand him, use what he is, get him in the studio when he's at his best. Study his performances:is he at his best on the first takes, or does it take some warming up? Does he get deeper into the song with coaching, or does he lose his special quality? Are the slow songs working best, or up-tempo? ..(and so on).. Method#2/ Have a concept that needs an artist to execute, and bend, twist, and pry that artist into the shape you've pre-determined... Method#2 works well for image-heavy, talent-light performers. In Ruben's case, it destroys everything he is: a decidedly not-hip, throw-back romantic singer. Ruben needs the hip-hop flavored aspects of this cd like Perry Como needed Stevie Ray Vaughan guitar solos. Let the guy be himself, that's all we ever loved about him."
2,I thought he was capable of more...,I was also quite disappointed by this CD... I was looking forward to hearing it but it just seems to be lacking that something that made him special on American Idol. It's too bad!
1,Wonderful? Amazing?? What's up with that?,"I cannot believe I am reading reviews of these songs that say they are ""wonderful"" and ""amazing."" C'mon people, you can be a fan of Ruben's but you need to start listening with your ears! The songs are boring; he sounds like he wants to be home sleeping; and he certainly shouldn't be compared to Luther or Barry. Ruben is a nice guy; he has a warm smile; he sings okay; but, this CD is not worth 5 stars, and the songs are not wonderful or amazing.Flying without wings is okay.Superstar is awful.I am being honest here. Don't spend your money on this, wait for his album, maybe he will have gotten enough sleep by then and be ready to give it his all. Let's also hope they put some pep in his songs, Superstar sounds like it's playing on the wrong speed..."
1,Didn't care for this cd,I bought this cd thinking that Ruben would be able to sound much better with a professionaly recorded cd. It wasn't and I didn't care for it at all. His voice is much like that of Luther Vandross but a bit more gravely. sorry Ruben. I love ya but not your voice.
3,over-produced,"First, to the other reviewers that want to compare to Clay, grow up. This should be about reviewing Ruben's CD on its own merit.The AI competition is in the past. Ruben won. Get over it.Ruben did a super job with Superstar on American Idol. Why the producers of this CD asked him to slow the tempo and change his vocal style, I will never understand. The whole thing is too slick and over-produced.Ruben, I hope you get a chance to do your own thing at some point. That will be worth the price of any CD. I still think you are great. I have no respect for your record producer, however."
2,Nice but nothing special,"This CD can best be described as just nice. Flying Without Wings is a good song but Ruben could use better enunciation of his words. Still the song is passable. Superstar, is really not very good. If this CD is any indication, Ruben will remain simply mediocre. I would recommend not wasting your money on this CD."
3,Good Voice but...,"I just don't think he's very into it. He's not singing his heart out. Ruben has a great voice, but if only we would let go in his music and act like he really believes in what he's saying. It's like he's reading what someone else wrote (which he is), but it shouldn't be that obvious that he didn't write it. He's not into it."
5,Ruben IS America's choice.,"The right person won again this season. This single kicks off with the amazing ""Flying Without Wings""... so uplifting! Ruben's velvety-smooth voice glides up effortlessly onto all the right notes. Some may say ""Superstar"" is too slow, but I really like what they've done with it. They used his voice to a great advantage. They probably could have cut off some of the intro... but that's just me. I eagerly await his solo album!"
2,"Hmmmmm, it's alright",This bored me - I found it just alright. I won't be listening to it anytime soon.
3,Flying without Wings,RUUUBBEENN! I like Ruben. His voice is smooth but It sounds like he runs out of breath & doesn't have the voice range to sing lots of song genres'. I don't mind listening to this song but I don't think I'll run out and buy it.
5,EXCELLENT!,"Ruben's CD is the best I've heard in a long time. Both songs were on the money. Clay's CD on the other hand was terrible, just awful, don't buy it, save your money."
1,"Buy Clay's Single Instead, or a Luther Vandross Album","Ruben's voice just does not cut it. It seems as though he tries to imitate Luther Vandross, and it does not come across as even near the level of Vandross' voice. Superstar is already on the other American Idol album, and Flying Without Wings, the way Ruben sings it, is just mediocre... there is no point in buying this single. Clay Aiken's single, on the other hand, is excellent. Ruben got the better written song, Flying Without Wings, as opposed to This Is The Night, but Clay has so much more talent than Ruben, that he can pull it off. If you are looking for an R and B voice like Ruben's, you are better off with a Luther Vandross album. But if you are looking for a real quality voice, purchase Clay's single."
3,Music lover from N.M.,"Ruben, I know that you are friends with clay, I have seen you both together and the great picture of you and clay sleeping when you were on tour, I really appreciate that you are special friends.This is what i don't understand about everyone that is disrespecting either of these young men.They are both great, they each have a different style, and voice, why do they have to be compared.Why can't we just enjoy both of them.I loved both of you on AI2.So those of you who wish to bash either of these 2 men it just don't make any sense.I hope you new album does as well as clay,s has done so far,you were right to let his come out first.GOD BLESS YOU, RUBEN."
3,"Not bad...but not really good, either","I'm not going to say anything about you-know-who, because this isn't about him, it's about Ruben. Just clarifying.Frankly, I'm sick of ""Superstar"", as lovely a song as it is. He sang it too many times and too slowly on the show that by the time this CD came out it was trite. ""Flying Without Wings"" is a better song, but I can't help wondering why they couldn't at least write out a new song for Ruben, rather than this Westlife cover. (I happen to prefer the original, but then Westlife never made it in the US so why not reuse?) I'm sure Steve Mac and Wayne Hector could have churned out something similar but new.Ruben does sound like Luther, I think, but a younger and less mature Luther. As he should--Ruben is only 25 years old and Luther Vandross is much older.So, basically, I think that this CD could have been a whole lot better, but he has a good voice and can carry a tune and that's more than many of his contemporaries can do, so three stars."
2,Not worth buying.....,Ruben is an okay singer but I just don't think he has what it takes to be the American Idol. I wouldn't waste your money on this CD. In my opinion Clay sings much better. Clay has a much better Vocal Range and blows Ruben away with his Cd. I would suggest buying Clay's CD. His single is Awesome. Clay is my American Idol.
1,Save your money - Get Westlife and Clay's CDs Instead,"Sadly, the voice just doesn't stand up without the visual image of Ruben smiling on stage. Sadly, for Ruben it also means radio play could be limited as well. I'm not sure why they chose Westlife's song for Ruben.Listening to Clays' This is the Night, then Westlife's version of Flying Without Wings and then Ruben's version - the lack of magnetism in Rubens voice becomes abundently clear.I'm really bummed, but Ruben just doesn't stack up without the visual aides."
1,Dreadful.....,"Being from Alabama I so wanted to like this CD, but it is just dreadful. I wish Ruben well, though."
3,"Nice vocals, but the song is disaster","This single does NOT do Ruben justice. If you watched his journey to become the new American Idol, he did MUCH better than this single gives him credit.The song is a boring, no climax, bubble gum pop/R&B song. I mean, look at who wrote the song, Steve Mac and Wayne Hector? Who??????? Contrastly, Clay Aiken's songs were written by Paul Simon and Aldo Nova. Ummm - I've at least heard of them!!Bottom line is Ruben will sell, but they sure started him out on the wrong foot. A very clumsily written song and a horrific cover photo. Maybe it doesn't pay to be the American Idol?"
3,It's okay......,"The CD is Okay but I can't tell the difference between him so much and Luther vandross..... That's not a bad thing but he should develop more of his own sound and style. Unfortunatley he is not as powerful as Clay. Definetly keep with the soul sounds though, just make sure his upcoming album sounds orginal.I have a major concern though that I have read several reports in regards to the upcoming album that it is supposed to be hip-hop. If that is the case, I'm sure he will do well but his career may end quickly because of it. Most of his fans like him for his soulful sounds and it may be a major turn off to those that were expecting it on the album and got hip hop instead...."
2,"FWW decent, but a let down; superstar provides a good nap.","I was extremely let down with Ruben's CD. Being a fan of both Ruben and Clay I was expecting great things from both of them when their singles released. That being said, Clay not only lived up to my expectations he surpassed them. Ruben, however, did not.While FWW is a good song, the recorded version lacks something that the live version had. It's not a bad song, I just feel it could have been better.Superstar should have been left of the CD entirely. Not only is it horrible, it's boring. If I manage to listen to it more than once all the way through I can almost guarantee you that I'll be fast asleep by the end of it.I hope to see better things out of Ruben, so far Ruben has just proved that Clay should have been the American Idol."
3,"good, but not great","ruben sang ""flying without wings"" pretty well on the recorded version, i'm really getting sick of ""superstar"" though, this is the third time i've heard him sing it. take my advice, get Clay's CD instead."
3,It's ok...,"I like it,but it just doesen't cut it for me. I think Ruben defineltly has a great voice,but I just didn't like Superstar....They should have chosen something different for the single,because Ruben's talent,to me,doesen't show in that song.I've liked Ruben from the beginning,but Clay now seems to be the better overall..."
2,Roooben deserves better,"I want to start out by saying that I like Ruben and I wanted to like this single. I think he has a lovely voice, and he's usually very enjoyable to listen to. However, whoever decided on these two songs for his debut single needs their head examined. ""Flying Without Wings"" is an insipid ballad that was bad enough when Westlife recorded it, but does not do Ruben's voice justice at all. ""Superstar"" is much better, but it's already available on the American Idol 2 love songs album, so why bother to buy the single? Clay Aiken (the runner up to Ruben on American Idol, for anyone who's been living under a rock) has two songs on his single only currently available on that single, whose bright idea was it to put only one new song on Ruben's single? My recommendation is to skip this single and buy the American Idol love songs album instead."
2,Makes It Obvious...,"Not a spectacular disc. Superstar... he's sung that so many times it's lost all significance. And Flying Without Wings... good, but not great. Ruben's release is OKAY, but when you compare it to Clay Aiken's... there really is no comparison."
2,Butchered Flying Without Wings,"I liked Ruben Studdard on American Idol 2. That is, I liked him until he butchered a beautful ballad. Flying Without Wings USED to be a beautiful song, but Ruben has made it horrible. I find it disgraceful that they would allow Ruben not only to record this song, but to release it as his first single in North America, without ONCE MENTIONING a very important fact. THIS SONG IS A COVER!!!!!! and a horrible one at that. Ruben is going to make this, to borrow a term from Simon, dreadful version popular in the United States when the group who originally recorded it, Westlife will never even be mentioned as the original group to sing the song.And that, is a shame."
3,"Good, but nothing compared to Clay's.","Seeing this is the first CD of Ruben, I expected it to be not as good as future albums he'll hopefully produce. All though Ruben has a good voice, he doesn't proclaim it out as much as he can. And I've seen him at his best. In these two songs, it seems as if he is holding something back throughout his singing. Unlike Clay's two songs, Ruben's seem alittle taken-back and lowly sung. Ruben is a good singer, no doubt, but he needs to proclaim his voice more. If you are a Ruben fan, I say get this CD just to support the guy. Who knows, you may have a different opinion than me."
1,This has to be the most boring song I've heard!!,"Yuck, Yuck, Yuck! Where is the Kelly-Clarkson-spirited song. This thing is a complete joke. Poor Rueben ... I should have ordered a burger! :("
1,"Ruben's ""Flying without wings"" is not the best","I couldn't believe that Ruben picked this song to release as a single and then didn't even do it justice. If you really want to hear a much better version of ""Flying without wings"", listen to the version by Westlife!!"
5,Ruben Studdard CD,"Ruben's CD is incredible. Flying Without Wings was just an amazing song for him so sing and it sounds like silk. Superstar is good, though a little bit long. His RnB voice is very soulful sounding and I would recommend anyone and everyone to buy his CD. While Clay Aiken has a louder and sometimes stronger voice than Ruben....Ruben is the better singer. More consistent, smooth and his transitions are flawless. (Clay has too much vibrato for my taste"
2,Just ok,I was a little disappointed with this CD. I do love Rubins voice very much. I just dont like these 2 songs. I have heard him do better on the American Idol show. I hope the producers give him some better songs for him to do on his CD.
3,OK but nothing to brag about.,Ruben Studdard sounds good but also sounds the same as many other R&B singers.His version of these previously recorded songs just doesn't impress enough to make you forget the original ones.The CD is OK but it doesn't take your breath away.
1,Nothing New,Ruben contributes nothing to music today. He is a R&B and Pop singer just like most of the singers today. Nothing new. He will not last long.
2,"nice guy, but no dice","Reubans singing is good, even above average but not enough to win over Clay Aikin in the American idol contest. The voting methods are highly suspect. And the numbers of cds purchased by customers tells the true story. Unfortunately Reuban is one dimentional, and his music is so soothing that it puts me to sleep. Clay on the other hand has a huge range of voice and it is inspirational and exciting. I like Reuban but if we want to be honest here then let me tell you this cd is a bit of a yawner I'm sorry to say. I guess it's a matter of personal choice. But the lions share of the talent, truthfully is in Clays court. The truth hurts sometimes but Reuban has nothing to be ashamed of. He is a talent in his own right. This doesn't take away from that. If he were my son I would be extremely proud of him and his accomplishments.God speed Reuban."
5,Ruben is flying without wings,"Right now I am listening to his single, and honestly it brings me to tears. He sounds so professional and like he's been doing this for years. Ruben is truly a great singer and is definetly worthy of the American Idol title!!!"
2,Not too Bad,"Ruben has a wonderful personality, as he showed on the show. He can really light up the stage with his beautiful smile. But, when all I heard was his voice, I wasn't as happy. His voice is slightly monotone in both songs. I hope to hear better when he releases his full CD."
1,Same Ole...Same Ole,"Production values were not on par with his voice, and his voice is showing signs of the strain that his overperforming has caused. The song was much better sounding from Westlife, if I'm being REALLY honest. Take a voice break, ROO!"
4,Flying Without Wings,"I think that Ruben is a wonderful and emotional singer who interprets lyrics quite well. It's a beautiful song, sung beautifully. My 4 stars are for the singer alone, the deletion of one star is due to the overblown and poor production value. He does not need all of the background noise."
3,A bit disappointing but enjoyable,"I really enjoyed watching and listening to Ruben on American Idol. He was such an endearing charming performer. I found that much of that was lost when his voice was recorded. ""Superstar"" is a particularly slow, lackluster track. Great song but give me Luther's version any day. Since the single was not very expensive, I don't feel too upset. I'll definitely think twice before plunking down more money for his full CD. I'm sure it will benefit from the added production time."
3,Just OK,"Ruben has a an ""easy listening"" voice that does not have much range. The production on his single Fly without wings is Horrible.He sings very well but is accompanied by what sounds like elevator music. His first CD should be good as long as they produce it as an R&B album with lots of soulful grooves. That would B cool G!"
2,"GREAT talent, not a great CD unfortunately","I really love Ruben but personally these songs just don't do it for me. I hate to say it but I think his version of Superstar is boring, slow, and tired. There's just no magic in it, there's a lack of that certain something special to make it stand out. I thought so when I first heard this song on the AI2 CD and I still think it. Ruben has a great voice, this song just doesn't showcase it the way it should be.As for Flying Without Wings it's an okay song. I think it's definitely better than Superstar but it's also not the best song choice for Ruben. There were so many songs Ruben sang on the show that he just knocked out of the park and sadly these two songs just don't compare. I really hope that next time they give him something meatier that he can sink his chops into!"
2,Decent singer- horrible song,"Ruben Studdard is a fine singer and his voice will fit in nicely within the generic catalog of R&B output. I received his single as a gift and I can't get past the silly lyrics, ""I'm flying without wings, 'cause you're my special thing (or THANG)..I'm flying without wings."" Blech.Superstar was a wonderful Karen Carpenter song and it was done once again by Luther Vandross(whose recording I own)...so where does Ruben Studdard fit in? A shadow of Luther. I guess I just don't see the need for another Luther-sounding recording of this song. Very strange."
2,"Good, but not great","While Ruben does have an undeniably good voice, his performances of these songs are a bit bland. The original versions of both songs (Flying Without Wings was originally a Westlife song) were more soulful than his renditions here. The American Idol judges cheated Ruben out of a chance to improve himself by refusing to offer the same criticsm to Ruben that other contestants on the show received. Ruben, unfortunately, never had a chance to improve himself from week to week."
2,"May be flying w/o wings, but he'll need lots of jet fuel!","I don't think Ruben is a bad singer, but he sounds just like Luther Vandross. Both songs on this CD seem flat without any soul. I wanted to like Ruben's CD, but have to admit that it is Clay's CD that shows more uniqueness and feeling. Of the two, I recommend buying Clay's. I expect to see Clay with his own variety show, and Ruben stopping by occasionally as a pop-in guest."
2,Ruben's new Single,All the big hype over this guy.....I had to buy it. The 2 songs on this CD are totally boring. How did he ever make it to the top? It clear that he is a Luther Vandross wannabe.
2,Just okay...not an attention grabber,"This performance is one dimensional. He never leaves his comfort zone and doesn't have the vocal stamina hold the notes so they pack a punch. It's not horrible...I would not change the station if I heard these songs on the radio, but they are not songs that I would request or suggest others buy. As far as American Idol, this doesn't live up to the hype. I'd rather listen to Kelly Clarkson's ""Miss Independent""...now that's how to belt out a fierce song!!"
2,"If you want to hear Luther, BUY Luther","Yes, Rubin can sing carbon copy of Luther. And that's ok. But if you want to hear Luther, Buy Luther!!! I rest my case."
1,This book will not help you practice Spanish,"This book is very poorly set up and does not help. It oversimplifies concepts and the answers to many of the exercises are mismatched with the questions, so it doesn't even give you the right answer. Also the exercise instructions are unclear. For example, it will say to replace the bolded word or phrase with a spanish word or phrase, but nothing will be bolded."
1,Just plain BAD,"I almost wonder if the editors of this book speak ANY language fluently. They describe a concept, then give an example that contradicts what they just said. Then they mix up terms like ""cardinal"" and ""ordinal"" numbers, switching back and forth on the same page. Sometimes the answers don't match the directions for an exercise, and sometimes the answers are just plain wrong. And this is supposed to help people learn??"
3,"Admiral Byrd, the Hollow Earth Exploration and UFOs","While not even close to a professional documentary, this film reveals details about the Hollow earth Theories, Admiral Byrds exploration (with actual film footage) and the connection to UFOs that are reported to come from inside Earth. What more could you expect for $1.95?"
3,"The Dr. Proves there's a Hollow Earth, that's all you need to know.","Spoiler alert...I wanted to watch this video to see what Dr. Krastman had REALLY experienced about underground civilizations, though it was just a debunking of the theory that beneath the earth's crust is a molten layer, instead, he claims, it's a hollow layer, with a surface like our earth facing inwards towards an inner sun, approximately 2,000 miles below where we live.The second half of the movie showed some silly old movie about fake travel to this place. It was really lame and unrealistic to travel 2,500 miles fairly easily and then rise back up through the water, where their dinky craft would have got crushed under pressure on the way up in reality.I want some real stories and video evidence of a hollow earth!"
4,Lyrical & Rich. This One's a Keeper!!!,"No funny stuff: just a very pretty collection of songs. Her song choices are interesting, but they play to her strength as a very good guitar picker. She has a very clear playing voice, and has very good command of her instrument and the tone she wants to communicate. For some strange reason, her playing reminds me of Miles Davis' playing in ""Kind of Blue"" or the singing of Nanci Griffith (Folk/Country Singer), in that her musical voice rings true--no fluff, no fancifull frills, just beautiful and at times sublime & eloquent guitar music."
3,"Good, but strange!","Even though he has written some really strange tales with Elric and the rest of the Eternal Champions Series. This one is perhaps the strangest of them all. While it begins rather slow and the plot is somewhat difficult to picture it is still a well done portriat of choas and good.However, my suggestion is to quickly get through without question to finish and go to volume 11.This volume may be better reading twice.But that's my view!"
4,Outrageous and fun,"From the moment the Iron Orchid makes her entrance on a seat of crushed bone, to outlandish adventures in Victorian England, a robot-run nursery and a primeval planet, this trilogy never flags. Moorcock creates consistent, believable characters, places them in enchanting and amusing settings and lets all hell break loose. Truly masterful writing and an ability to move and delight place Moorcock in the ranks of great sci-fi writers who transcend the genre, like Neal Stephenson and Orson Scott Card. His wicked and subtle sense of humor puts him in company with Wodehouse and Dickens. Now if only I could meet a man like Jherek..."
5,brain allergies,"usualy people conect allergy with something that is only cause headach,neusia,or a rash. but how many of you (the readers) are conecting allergy to a disturb mental state, or one type of schizophrenia?.there are many sections in this book that are all explaining the allergy from the roots and the way it should be treated through the rotation diets combined with specific suplements. it is all explained in an easy to follow-way, and a lot of case histories are covered.an allergy discusion is not complete without this book."
2,Light is good but shade,Bought this item after reading reviews. Delivered quickly and installation was a breeze using inculded tube mount. My only complaint is the shipping box was not damaged but the plastic shade was cracked all the way from top to bottom and the seller says right in the warranty that they don't cover damage. The light works fine so I'll live with the cracked shade.
4,Hanging organizer or use on the go,You can hang it or carry it with you! Very convenient for things you need in office & occasionally take along
4,Perfect solution for my desk,"I have limited desk room, and needed a way to keep my papers handy without cluttering up my desk. This product is the perfect solution! I have it on the wall right next to my desk, and I just pull the files out when I need them. My desk stays clear. I usually don't need to take my files with me anywhere, but I love that this offers that capability as well. Smart design, Pendaflex!"
4,Works great for my teenage school work,"This design is really great! My daughter loves it and has become far more organized just because of this little addition to her room. After working on her assignments she puts her work into the hanging file system labelled for that specific subject. When it's time to take the work with her to school, she can fold it up and off she goes. Keeps it all together.The colors are fun and vibrant and the system is well designed and very useful. It's good for those who like to see what they are working on or need reminders of where to put their work so it won't get lost or misplaced. She loves it, and so do I! Highly recommend!"
5,Not sure how I lived this long without it.,"This is probably the single best productivity / focusing tool I have ever owned. Load it up with what you need to get done today or this week, then tackle it color by color. I cut the black panel at the bottom off -- I think you just need that if you need to pack it back in its carry case -- it looks prettier without it."
3,"Durable and light, but battery life is subpar","When I saw this light, I got really excited about the small size and flexibility and completely ignored something equally important: batteries. Included with the light were two C2032 coin-size lithium batteries. The box promised that these batteries would last approximately 20 hours, but by my estimation, the light started to go dim after only about 16 hours of use. This does not seem like a big deal, but C2032 batteries can be expensive to replace (I paid 2.99 a pop at Batteries Plus), and if you're not careful, your cute little book light might end up costing you more to power than a 100 watt lamp. If you intend to use this light often, I recommend that you order a bulk amount of replacement batteries from Amazon."
2,Weak light,"OK product, but the beam is weak. It is adequate as supplemental lighting for a book (i.e., when you have overhead lighting) but not enough if you are reading in the dark or in low overall light environments.Definitely NOT recommended for use with large books, like textbooks. The light coverage is simply not adequate and the neck is not long enough to let you compensate for this by adjusting the beam down the page as you read.The other thing I don't like is the light cover has that clear bottom that doesn't shield the beam from your eyes when placed at most angles over the book, leading to eye strain (think reading under an incandescent bulb without a lampshade). A much better light is the Mighty Bright.02/15/2008 Update: worse than I thought. Would rate less then two stars but can't edit the original rating. This light is too weak, the clip is bulky but not strong. Threw mine away because it serves no purpose!"
1,This light sucks!,"I ordered this with the blue flex light. The blue light was great and gave a lot of light. THIS light had smaller light bulbs, barely gave off light and was a BIG disappointment. Amazon paired this with the blue one and I assumed they were the same. This one is not worth the money at all. If I didn't know how difficult returns are, I would definitely get my lousy $9.98 back. But I would take another blue one!"
1,Very Poorly Made,"I like the price, size and style of this light very much. Unfortunately, when I opened mine, only one of the LEDs worked, so I exchanged it for another one. Both the LEDs light up in the second one, but the switch is defective, so it won't stay on unless I keep my thumb pressed down on it. I could dismiss one defective unit, but two in a row? I'm not sure if I'm up for a third try. Two strikes and you're out."
1,broken home,I couldn't wait to be able to read at night without needing to have my large light on and well i recieved my light and it was broken also it didn't even turn on. what a waste. lets see if i get refunded.
2,cute for a moment,really liked it the first couple of uses. after not even half a month it is not working anymore. the switch is not turning on the light. even after changing the batteries it is still not working. I guess you get what you pay for.
3,"Perfect at first, but then not so good","Initially I thought this was the best book reading light I've ever had. It was bright and the neck is the perfectd length with a very easy to flex neck that is also very stable when you get it into the position you want. However, the battery didn't last all that long, which isn't a huge deal just an inconvenience to replace it, plus it takes TWO batteries and the total cost is basically the same as the book light itself. Also, and more importantly, after a few months use one of the springs on the clip broke and I could no longer attach it onto a book."
2,cute but not durable,"I bought three. Two worked and one did not. The push button is not really durable. they are, however, very lightweight and the flexible neck works well."
2,Mine was dead within weeks!,"I was really unimpressed. The light dimmed so quickly that it was useless within weeks. I'm not sure if I got a faulty one, but I was not impressed."
4,LightWedge book light,"Not as bright as I had hoped, but works OK when attached to a book. I replaced the batteries that came with it and that seemed to help with the brightness."
5,best book light!,I bought my daughter this book light expecting it to be cheap and flimsy for the price. but when I got it I was so surprised because it was such a quality item. I have now ordered a second one for my son!
1,Useless device,"Its simply useless. Barely any light to read. I ended up returning this and buying a different oneRitelite LPL792XLB 5-LED Computer and Book Light, Metal. Save yourself some time and money and buy a better one than this."
2,Itty Bitty,"This light is very, very, very small. It is about the size of a nickle! The light it puts out is not particularly bright. Might be great for reading on a camping trip or something, but otherwise, not a great buy."
1,Does not shed light!,Worthless! I purchased one for my daughter and it does not work at all. It has to be pitch black for the light to even be visible. We put fresh batteries in it but to no avail. She just needed a little help reading in our very dim living room but since you can't see the light it's more like a really heavy bookmark.
5,Works great!,"For Christmas I purchased a $20 Kindle light for my husband, which I really liked. I decided to purchase one for myself and found this one for half the price. It's exactly the same, works great, and I can read in bed without turning on the overhead light, etc. It shines on the page very well, I have no trouble seeing, clips on well (although I clip several pages together at once if it's a soft-bound book), and moves easily if you need to flash more light anywhere. So far I've used it nearly every night for about 1.5 months and the little battery is still working fine. It came with 2 spares though, and we purchased an extra package of batteries so I'm good. Although I've read other reviews about the light switch going out, this hasn't happened with mine. At this price, I'm not too concerned about it, either."
1,Worse Reading Light EVER,"When I received my long awaited reading light, which took about 3 weeks to be delivered, it did not work. It was not just that it did not work, came with a dead battery and the screws at the base of the reading light were stripped, which means that this reading light was used. Now I understand why it is under $10. Don't waste your time looking at this product!!!! How came a person mail a used reading light to a paying customer? I am unsure and untrusting when I am looking again for another new reading light."
4,Great as expected,"I find this light useful, wish it was a bit brighter but it works. I use if with my iPad in low light to see my keyboard."
4,love the size!,"I purchased this for myself after a recent family vacation. I stayed up reading, needing to keep the light on. It would be great to have this on such occasions. I haven't used it yet, but because I like it's small size and light weight, I gave it four stars."
2,Poor Light,"If you are over 40 and your eyesight is ""not as good as it used to be"", then think twice about this reading lamp. It barely emits enough light to fully illuminate the entirety of a small paperback, let alone a full-sized hardback book. I found myself juggling with the light when I got to the bottom of the page. A hassle!"
4,Great purchase!,I am satisfied with the purchase! I placed my order and it was at my door in no time. I was well informed of the product by the information they have provided. The clamp is average.
3,Perfectly Useful Reading Lamp-- Horrible Color,"Let us be frank. I bought this because it was cheap. I suspect it was cheap because it is a horrible pinkish, flesh color. The name of the color is cameo-- meant, I assume to call to mind the soft pinkish shell color of the background of so many items of cameo jewelry. It is not a happy color choice.However, other than that, it is a perfectly serviceable clip on book light.Recommended for the color blind."
1,Poor poor quality!,"This item is not a reliable product. The button to turn on an off the light broke on the second day, now I have to use tape to turn on the light. The light it self is not strong as I was expecting. I am sure that for a bit more you can buy a better product.The batteries came dead so if you are planning to buy this don't forget to buy some batteries as well."
1,Returning Item,"This light is way underpowered. I attached it to my laptop after work, and the light barely reached the keyboard. Tried it with a few books too and found myself straining to see the words on the page.Additionally this light did not come with the extra set of batteries mentioned on the packaging. Maybe replacing the bulbs would have helped, but I'm not going to spend extra money for lightbulbs on this underpowered light."
1,"functions well, not useful","I'm unhappy with this light primarily because of the quality of the light. It seems to be both too bright, nearly blindingly blue, which startles anyone else near it into full wakefulness, but it is also not that bright on the actual page it is illuminating.The physical design works fine, but the light is poorly thought out."
3,lightwedge flex neck reading light,"The light works well, but the base clip is large and does not fit very well around the narrow edge of my Kindle reader."
5,Perfect Size!,"I love this little light!! I can use it just about anywhere where I need a little extra light. Normally, it sits on my treadmill so I can read the display. I also use it on my sewing machine in addition to the built-in light.The batteries that came with it didn't seem to last very long but the new ones I bought are lasting far longer. The arm of the light can bend into virtually any position which is what makes it so extra nice.I purchased a different brand of light locally because I needed a second light. Paid more for it and it doesn't even compare to how nice this light is. Definitely a good buy."
3,"Casts light over wide area, lightweight","In my use of the product, there are two points that I'd like to make.1. The light that the two LEDs produce is cast over a wide area. If using on a pbook or on an ebook reader, it will illuminate the area around the item, in addition to the item itself.2. The clear lens also casts light horizontally, i.e., into one's eyes. I found this feature very annoying. However, a piece of electrical tape fixed this issue.The reason I purchased this item instead of others is that it is powered by CR2032 batteries. These are much lighter weight than AA or AAA batteries. Although the clip/base is pretty big, about 2"" diameter, the whole thing is pretty light."
5,RE:Granddaughter loves reading her books with the night light,This turned out to be a very useful gift for my Granddaughter. She feels so grown up using the night light and reading while everyone else is asleep.
4,Good light; better for paper than kindle,"This light is well-made with a nice finish and solid switch. It puts out plenty of illumination and is an ideal choice for reading traditional books. For use with a kindle the light is a little too focused and uneven for my taste, producing a bright spot that makes reading a little less enjoyable (but is still certainly usable)."
2,Reading Light Review,"I purchased three reading lights in different colors. This particular one arrived with the green light piece not securely attached to the green piece on the end of the neck. Within a week, a visiting child had it in two separate pieces and it had to be thrown away. The one light that came in good condition and working order is fantastic, but it's not good when two out of three had issues."
1,"low light, already broken","This light was never strong enough. I could barely see a few lines on the page and it didn't cover a whole page in a paperback. Now, after just a few months, one light doesn't turn on and sometimes, won't turn off. Don't waste your money."
3,reading light,"I was very happy when I first received it, worked great.Now the light is dull and if the battery is not in place won't turn on.Did not pay a lot so it is worth the money. Considering purchasing adifferent one."
3,I never got it...,"Amazon shipped this, or so they said. UPS delivered it, or so they said. All I know is that I never got it. Both parties wanted to pass the buck on whose actual fault it was. I'm a frequent home delivery recipient and have never had a problem like this before. Kudos to Amazon for not giving me the run around and just issuing me a credit immediately. I did, however, go and buy this same product from a Borders store. It's cute and pink and compact and inexpensive. Now, the actual lighting of the thing? I don't know. I gave it as a gift. My gift recipient was delighted, though."
1,Very bad,Do not buy this device it is very very very bad and you will not get any benefit out of it.
2,"ok for what i paid, but wouldnt buy it again","bought two of these to go along with the books i bought for my nephews for Christmas. Tried both of them out to make sure batteries were ready to go and noticed immediately some manufacture inferiorities. First, battery and bulb are a poor match and you'll find yourself changing them often. Second issue is the clip. One of the lights i purchased has a clip spring too weak to hold itself up on a book. So to make sure everything is evened off in the wash, nephew #1 gets the weak spring and nephew #2 gets the near-dead battery. with shipping, i paid just over $8 for both of these to be delivered to my door, so i wasn't going waste my time with repackaging and shipping off back to amazon. Learned my lesson, next year i go back to buying giftcards."
2,You get what you pay for..,"This book light got dim pretty quickly and I ended up replacing it. It was super-cheap so I can't complain too much, but I wish I'd bought something better to begin with."
4,Flex Neck Reading Light,The construction seems be sturdy (for the price). The light from this device is sufficient to cover both pages of a book. Not very happy with battery life though. Got about 5 hrs of reading over a period of 2 weeks. The problem could be the batteries shipped with the device.
3,Cute but NOT bright enough,"I just received my flex neck light and it's super cute and light weight. My main purpose for buying this light is because I wanted a bright light to help me see whenever I read at nights but unfortunately this light isn't as I bright as I was expecting it to be.If you are someone with poor eyesight then this light wouldn't be ideal for you. My sight is pretty good and the light helps me to see the words in the book but it reflects more like ""a candle light"" which isn't adequate lighting for reading unless you want to eventually go blind. Hence, I gave it a 3 stars only for it's cuteness, lightweight and flexibility. If anyone know of another brand with a brighter light please recommend. Thanks"
2,The push button switch is low quality,"I've been on the quest for a good book light for a very long time. Usually they start off OK, but dim considerably after just a few hours of use and also have dark spots in the corners of the page. This light does NOT have that problem. It is very bright, it easily illuminates two full pages of a large hardcover novel with no dark spots. It's easy to read by. I love the flexible neck and the big clip that can fasten over multiple pages and holds like a champ. The problem is the switch. It is a push button that does not work reliably. Sometimes you have to push the button ten times to turn it on or off, the other night I spent a half an hour fiddling with the stupid thing before I finally got a screw driver and removed the battery. Of course, by the time I did that, I was no longer relaxed enough to sleep. This book light would be perfect if the switch worked. I'm really disappointed."
2,Too dim,"Nice flexibility with the bendy neck, but changing the battery didn't make it any brighter. I had to move the light down the page as I read, and even on paperbacks the light didn't spread all the way across the page. I'd rather wear a headlamp than unclip the light every time I need to turn the page anyway."
2,Weak Light,The lighting is not sufficient for comfortable reading. I guess for $3.0 we shouldn't expect more.
3,GODD WHILE IT LASTS,This is a good little book light but battery ran out very quickly. It also is not that sturdy. One of them I ordered broke apart the next day
2,Not so great.,"After opening it, the light was functional for about 5 minutes until the clip broke. That was OK, as it's something to put in my kids' room for reading - didn't necessarily need to clip. However, the button to turn it on and off is terrible, incredibly touchy. Fortunately, only spent a couple of bucks on it...."
2,flawed,This book light is hard to position correctly if you are reclining reading - the light does not distribute evenly. Also it is temperamental about turning on and off- sometimes the button on top does not depress correctly and it takes multiple tries to get it to turn on or off. Also quite heavy so if not clipped to a sturdy group of pages or magazine it falls forward.
3,Weak light,"This light is light weight and clips on well to my Kindle, however the light is weak and the compartment for the batteries needs a special little screw driver to open it.I would not recommend buying it."
3,Not enough light,"This is a very light, well designed reading light except for one thing... The LED lights do not give adequate light! And, after all, that is the point. My eyes are almost crossing at the dim, gray lighting for nighttime reading."
5,Flex Neck Kindle Light,I bought two Flex Neck Kindle Lights for my two daughter for Christmas. They are both avid readers and travel a great deal. They have repeatedly called me to tell me how much they enjoy the convenience of using that light. I must buy one for myself.
4,Good cheap light,"I've had this light for about two weeks now and find it very good for a cheap reading light. It's light isn't the most focused, but it's bright enough to read by without flooding the room. The flex neck lets you move the light in closer if you're reading something larger like a magazine or want to try to limit the overflow of the light lest it bother anyone else."
5,Perfect,"This reading light is great, the flexing neck lets you bend it any way you need for where you clip it, the 2 LEDs put out just the right ammount of light to see both pages perfectly without throwing any light around the room, and for 10 bucks you just cant beat this. Best reading light ever.Update: Been using this for several months now. Still like it very much.. the batteries are a little more expensive than AAAs would be, $5 for the 2 it uses if I remember correctly, but its worth it cuz theyre very lightweight."
5,"Nifty, useful, and chic","My wife gave this to me as a birthday gift and after using it several times, I have found that it is a pretty good deal. Several things -1.) The neck is bindy, so I've used it to shine down and shine up, to the left and to the right.2.) The clip doesn't destroy the book or crease the pages.3.) The Light is nice and bright but not daylight.Get the light. Or, maybe, come to the light? Nah, get the light."
5,Great reading light,"This light works well for reading in bed. I can keep the light focused on the book, not on the sleeping baby."
4,Very lite and light,Size is great and adds NO weight to the Kindle. Some say the light is not bright enough. Almost too bright for me but impossible to find one that is not. Love it overall and hope it holds up. Nice that it folds in a circle for travel. Will just pop the battery out in the airport so it doesn't turn on.
4,given to me as gift for kindle 3,I was given this as a gift two years ago with a paperback and loved it. Then this year I was given a kindle three. I have been using it with that and it is perfect. I use it mostly at night when laying down and it so lightweight and easily clips on top of the kindle. I love that it is flexible and I can be sure to point it away from hubby if he is sleeping or if I do not want the light to be as intense. The batteries can get a bit pricey in dept stores but I have found them in dollar stores and you can get a pack of 50 for ten buck on amazon. The only down side I have is sometimes I can get a reflection on my kindle screen from the 2 pinpoint lights but if you angle the light a bit to the side they go away. Over all I am very pleased with this item. The biggest plus is mine is now going on three years of use and it still works like day one.
2,eh not so good,"I bought this game thinking it could possibly be like the old PC games S.W.A.T. man was I wrong, The game is alright, but just crap compared to those old PC games. you can control your team fine, but your character, not so much he tends to stay focused on one person then walks backwards until that persons out of view and turns around to walk correctly, a poor game really. if you want to check it out rent, or wait til it drops down to the low prices."
3,Its alright,"When i bought this game, i thought it was like FPS, but no, is more like killzone liberation, a third point of view. I would recomend to rent first. the graphics are alright. It just game lacks it when you lock some one, and then you want to switch targets."
3,Jaz Fans Here's your Night,"Jaz lovers would discover through this movie one of the most famous jaz festivals in the world. Held yearly, the festival is a must-go for that music genra fans. The beauty of Tabarka, a coastal town in the noth-west of Tunisia, will only add magic to the event as it did to this movie... Enjoy!"
3,NOT Lee Norris (but not bad),"For those fans of the Lee Norris vehicle Metamatics, please be informed that this is the US avant-punk band ""The Meta-matics"".NOT IDM!Listen to the streamed samples first!I was somewhat peeved at first that I bought this cd (thinking I was picking up a listening-techno gem), but as a fan of all kinds of progressive music, it's actually not too bad. There's talent behind the screaming... But it's definitely not for those who run at the mere sight of guitars."
5,Great System,"This is a great system for quarterly tax purposes. We own a trucking company, so when a job is completed we file all of that particular job's paperwork in the month the job was completed. It was somewhat painful to get organized, but now it is truley pain free to stay that way. I would love to see a filing system just like this one but with 12 compartments for annual type filing."
1,Too SMALL.,"Note, I am NOT giving these ear plugs 1 star because they are a bad product, in fact they may be a GREAT product if they were large enough to plug my ears...so I will never know. Just be aware that they are SMALLER than an average size ear plug. They are the same size as those ""Pretty in Pink"" ear plugs marketed for women. They do feel very soft though, yes, but they don't expand enough to block any sound from my apparently large ear holes.BTW, the most comfortable(don't make your ears hurt and no noise on pillow) and best noise blocking earplugs I have found for sleeping are the 3M 1120 and the Howard Leight MAX orange cones, in that order."
5,great.,"great. best product ever. Very soft and Very comfortable. I use them on the train, while reading and while studying. Keep up the good work Hearos!!!"
2,Ok,They look and feel cheep but they totally do the job. They blind in with my skin color. You also get a lot of them.
1,Can't read it,"I'm sure it is because this is an old book, but the pages in the pdf file are practically illegible."
4,"Great Mat, But ""game mode"" is too fast for beginning age group.","I know a lot of people are complaining about the ""game-mode"" of the dance mat. I completely agree that the game is too advanced for a 3-year-old, maybe even 4, but I think this is a benefit. This gives the mat more longevity and my son (who just turned 3) will play with it for longer. Right now, he really enjoys making his own music by jumping on the different characters, or playing ""back-ground"" music to the 4 pre-made songs. I haven't found any problems with needing to have your feet in a specific place. I have played on this mat several times, and, if anything, I feel it is pretty generous with where you can step. Also, I have played the dancing game twice, and it is hard, but I was able to play for a minute. I think it is a great stepping-stool kind of toy. I would highly recommend this, but if you are looking for a ""follow-me"" kind of game for a 3 year-old, this mat isn't for you."
2,Disappointed - not what I expected,"I thought this toy would be a good way to get my grandaughter to exercise. However, when you set it for the ""follow me"" mode, it does not allow a child enough time to follow the lighted character and you must push the ""Follow Me"" button once again to start over. It is frustrating for the child and because of this feature, it isn't as fun as it could be. Perhaps this product could be improved by having a slower and faster mode. I was very disappointed with the overall product. However, the mat is well made and very bright and attractive."
1,frustrating!,"I liked the concept of this because my daughter loves to dance, but this mat is way too fast for a 4 year old and for myself! It also does not work properly when you step on some of the pictures, you have to stomp real hard and have your foot positioned perfectly or the game is over. We have yet to have a game last more then 10 seconds. I would not reccommend this, it is a real waste of money."
2,Game too fast for age rating,"My 4 year old was excited about the idea of this. He doesn't want to just step on the mat to hear the sounds, he wants to play the game. But the game moves way too fast for the age 3 & up rating it was given. I am a very in shape coordinated adult & I find it not easy to keep up with. And sometimes even when you get it right, it thinks you did it wrong. When you do get it wrong, it goes through a short oops sort of tune before you can restart the game. So my 4 year old just ends up hearing that over & over, usually after 1 or 2 steps is all, & he quickly became very frustrated. I found it frustrating when I tried it as well. I spent more on this item than others I saw because it said it was suitable for ages 3 & up. But it's definitely not. I may as well have gotten a cheaper one he couldn't keep up with."
2,mat doesn't light up,"i bought this thinking the actual mat would light up if my daughter played on it...nope...only the control panel lights up...it's just not fun that way as the kids don't associate stepping on the mat with the lights on the control panel...i wish the mat would light up, it would be much more fun."
1,False Advertising,"Until the publisher puts August Derleth's name on the cover of this book, I'm gonna give it one star. This is just ridiculous. Imagine, if you will, Stephen King's publisher writing a book after King dies, then publishing it under King's name. That's basically what August Derleth and the publishing company have done here.I think Derleth is dead, so this isn't really his fault. Still, I wasted five bucks thinking I was buying a book of H.P. Lovecraft stories.Stick to the Del Rey or Arkham House published Lovecraft books. At least those ones were written by Lovecraft himself."
1,Derleth is such a FAKE,"These stories were written by August Derleth based on a few notes by Lovecraft. These stories are NOT by LOVECRAFT. Derleth is not even in the same category as Poe, Lovecraft, King. It is such a shame that this book mentions Lovecraft as an author when it isnt his work at all."
2,This book is not the work of H.P. Lovecraft,"Despite the book's byline and what some reviewers here are telling you, this book is 99% the work of August Derleth, executor of the estate of H.P. Lovecraft. Derleth merely took a few sentences from Lovecraft's writing journal (""The Common Book"") and made stories out of them, claiming collaboration. He used the same ideas over and over again, which is why these short stories begin to humorously resemble on another after awhile (come on, how many stories can you end with a massive run on sentence in italics?). Guy inherits house, guy finds old books, guy goes nuts. Derleth never really understood Lovecraft's appeal. Interesting only if you've read most of Lovecraft's work, and Derleth has done much better mythos pastisches: check out Carroll and Graf's ""Mask of Cthulhu"" and ""Trail of Cthulhu"", both of which have Derleth's byline instead of a hoax!"
2,False advertisting,"Talk about false advertising. Derlith's name doesn't even appear on the front cover of binding. Only Lovecraft's. If I had known, I wouldn't have bought it!"
2,IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR STORIES WRITTEN BY LOVECRAFT...,"...do NOT buy this book ---- for it is nothing but a bald-faced (lie) attempt by Ballantine books to capitalize on the Lovecraft name. If you're looking for stories actually written by HPL then look somewhere else. If you're only looking for mythos stories then buy this book. They're pretty good, just not up to the level of Lovecraft."
2,Items fall out of the pocket sides,"If I would have realized this product was not closed on the sides down to the bottom, I would not have purchased it. Small papers fall out from the side where it is not enclosed."
1,Pretend Play Kit review - not worth the purchase,"I was disappointed in this product. It looked much better on the website. The set didn't really include much in the way of pretend foods. The apron is cute but overall, not worth the purchase."
3,It is pretty good for the money...,"The kids are showing interest in people's jobs and curious to playing store. I thought this would be fun for them. They like it, but since it was a Christmas gift, I think they have been too overwhelmed by everything to appreciate it. It is definitely a cheaper made play set - but the price reflected that. My daughter's favorite thing is the apron - of course, she loves to dress up. It is a fun toy, but not a favorite."
5,This will WOW the kids...,"This is actually a really nice set for the price. Seems durable, not chinsey. The grandkids love it. This will make a nice addition to the kids playing store. I would recommend."
1,Look elsewhere,"Very disappointed in this item. It is flimsy and hardly worth the cost. Most of the food items were made from cardboard, and will not survive for long."
4,"OK, alittle dissapointing.","Bought for granddaughters to play ""store"". Dissappointed with set because the ""credit card"" is just a piece of plastic with nothing on it-can't tell that it's the CC. Signs are just pieces of laminated paper; some of groceries are only small cardboard boxes and there are very little groceries in the set. The best part for my girls was the apron! They loved the apron! Overall, it's cute but the only thing in it worth anything was the apron!"
4,Fun for pretend play,"We have the Learning Resources cash register, and my 4-year-old daughter loves it! So, we bought this to add to the pretend play. She loves to ""open"" and ""close"" the store with the sign as well as play with all the other signs, the ""sale"" especially. Apron is cute, too, and nice that you can personalize it. Boxes of food that it comes with won't last very long as they are just thin cardboard. We tried to reinforce by taping-we'll see how that goes. Overall good toy to coordinate with the cash register."
5,Hard sought-after rock classic brings back memories,"From their performance on SNL (""Art Lover"" with a disclaimer for the song content)I fell in love with this album. I have looked for this CD for years, only to find it out of release. Amazing that it has finally been re-issued! One of the Kinks strongest albums both lyrically and musically, a true gem."
2,"""Once we had dignity and grace...","...now we have got nothing but our own time to waste"" went the lyrics to one of the songs on this album. They say that self knowledge is important: well, that sums it up. I bought this when it was released in 1982 and was appalled that the same band that could come up with ideosyncratic gems like 'Days' or 'Waterloo Sunset' could also produce this characterless, MOR rubbish. And then, to remind listeners of the way it used to be, to end the album with another gem, 'Better Things'. That priceless little song is the only reason this gets two stars, not one."
2,Mouse constantly stuck,"I bought this for my husband. His mouse didn't work at all on it, and mine works better but often times the cursor gets stuck and doesn't move. We have high quality mouses so that shouldn't be the problem. Maybe if you have a rollerball mouse, you'd like this pad."
1,Battlefield Dearth...,"Well, this one tries real hard to be a cult classic. Too hard. It's 1950-something, and an alien craft has landed behind a movie theatre. The theatre is nearly empty, save for three hoods, two geeks, a titanically endowed blonde and her boyfriend, a fat chick (Charity Case) and her pencil-neck date, a drunk, a hillbilly couple, and a girl who keeps pulling extremely long boogers out of her nose. Sound exciting? Anyway, the ""crowd"" is there to see ""Space Patrol"", a silly movie about time travel starring Bob Clarke and Ann Robinson. We are taken back and forth between the movie and the audience watching it. This is dull to the point of agony! I kept hoping the alien monster would slaughter everyone involved! Alas, it only kills the ticket-lady, a homeless guy, and the theatre manager! The rest is an exercise in tedium, where time actually warps! I finished the movie having aged ten years in 90 minutes! Watch at your own peril..."
1,Don't waste your time,"This one fully deserves the MST3K treatment it'll never get. It's puerile, full of foul language, and double entendre. The script feels as if it were written by a couple of 13 year old boys who tried to include every sex joke they know while attempting to shock their friends. The movie-in-a-movie ""Space Patrol"" *might* have qualified as a lower echelon camp classic if it were not enmeshed in the celluloid wasting theatre wrapping. I get the impression Wade Williams and crew were attempting to create a ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" in the sci-fi genre. They failed miserably. Bad script, bad acting, mostly bad special effects (only those in ""Space Patrol"" are decent) all add up to a bad movie.If you *must* own this one at least spring for theMission Mars Collection - Flight to Mars/Attack From Mars/Invaders From Marsso you'll get a couple of decent 50's sci-fi adventures at a fair price with this turkey basically thrown in free."
3,"Fun plot, over the top in a few areas","A fun movie for the most part, with a few areas taken over the top. There are quite a few visual gags. A few are classic, but a few are a little gross. Nice Saturday afternoon escapism."
3,too many chefs in the kitchen almost ruined this,"not that this was/is a great movie,but minus a few charactors and it would have been a better one.decent effects,nice flow,a good mix of humor/horror,fine acting/directing/editing=3 stars.this is leaps and bounds better than the farce spielberg unleashed.this puts that to shame(thats not saying much!)"
5,Absolutely beautiful,I am a massage therapist and use this in my practice-- the clients and I both absolutely love it. If you do not like bird or nature sounds with your music then this is not for you.
2,:(,"This CD is just....bad. Ar least in my oppinion. I disliked it. The only reason I listened to it was for the Aly and AJ ""Walking on Sunshine"" song. To tell you the truth, other than that song, I hated it."
3,WHATS THE DEAL?,Why do they have the original artists in the movie but then when you buy the soundtracks its all covers from other artists?
3,"A little disappointing, but it's okay.","This CD is okay. Not good, not bad. Overall, just okay. The good thing of this CD is the songs are quite rocky because it should suit the racing movie. The bad thing is on track 12. You know, they shouldn't put an old song in the movie, right? I believe so. So, this is the thing which cost the whole CD not perfect."
1,Original Soundtrack?,"I don't know how the record producer for this album has the audacity to call it the ORIGINAL soundtrack. The following songs on the soundtrack are not performed by the ORIGINAL artists from the movie:Walking on SunshineFun, Fun, FunMagic,Roll On Down the HighwayBorn To Be WildMore Than A FeelingMetal GuruHaving mistakenly bought the album thinking it would be the ORIGINAL music, I can categorically say that the covers are no comparison to the ORIGINAL. I was very disappointed in my purchase. DO NOT get this album if you are expecting to hear the same music as the movie."
3,"You hear them, but only in the movie","The covers on this CD are not bad but they are definitely not what I was anticipating after seeing the film. And of course it has no point, it's supposed to be a fun film. I only have one question thought, where is the original or cover for ""Jump"" from Van Halen when Herbie is in the demolition derby? Anybody know?"
3,Go for the P900...,"It involves more money but it is worth the price. The improvements are excellent making it the best phone, PDA, MP3, mpg4 movies and internet browser combined."
1,Unreliable Suport,"This is a great phone and PDA, until.... fails!, I enjoyed the P800 for 20 days, then, the touch screen stop working, on this device means all!, at the end only the on/off button works, The vendor saids that they can't apply the warranty becouse they don't have phones, unless I acepted a motorola with price $100 lower! and i would lose the diference. and the service center that I have to pay if I want that they fix It! (Is still under warranty!!) anyway was impresive for the time it works, my recomendation, Check if the company were you purchase the phone is honest and have the capacity to cover the warranty. It's a great phone, shiny it don't last.. (oh and the online support never giveme a solution!)"
3,P800 good phone but,make sure you steer clear of cleaning the screen too much. the screen is too sensitive to cleaning. i had 2 yes 2 screens stop working because of light cleaning. they should have made it more apt to cleaning because the screen gets smudge etc. the treo 600 gets smudge but cleaning it is much easier and i havent had it die on me...anyway its a cool phone but becareful when cleaning only use a slightly and i mean very slightly wet cloth
4,actually P800 is not too bad,"I have been using this phone for almost a year and if ind it and excellent gadget.SE P800 is, however, a challenge sometimes.GUI could be improved to give bigger buttons when using touchscreen with fingers. Power saving mode could be improved.I used it all over US, Germany and Russia. Works well. US mobile companies are way behind on SE pda phone product line. i don't know why. perhaps there's not a high enough demand in their estimations.Sony are not making them any longer. It is time to upgrade to P910i."
1,I am disappointed,"Perharps we had raised our expectations too much.The truth of the matter is that the phone can only be used with AT&T and in this area at this time this telephone company has a poor connectivity.Also we found,(my fiancee and I both own one thanks to the unhappy idea of christmas gifts)that the keyboard is not so easy to access and overall the features so strongly advertised are not useable.Also I would like to add that Sony-Eriksson would not insure these phones,and we think for a pricey gadget as such this being a letdown."
1,AT&T and Cingular obsoleting this phone,"Really wanted the P800, then the P900, but I'm glad I held off.AT&T and Cingular are building out their networks using GSM 850 rather than the GSM 900 frequency that this phone supports. So this phone will only connect via GSM 1900 in the US, in places where coverage was already available. If we want improved access, and AT&T's GSM 1900 coverage is very poor, then we'll have to wait for comparable GSM 850 phones. As of now, there aren't any."
2,Overpriced Shipping,"I did a quick purchase of this item on Amazon. My mistake. I found later that the shipping was nearly twice the price of the item! When I send a message to the seller why this was the case, I received no response."
4,teaches to care about poor people,"It's a great cartoon. It teaches you to care about poor people.People who don't care need to see it. The little match girl is one of the poor people and tries to sell matches, but no one wants any. It is rather gut wrenching but you need to see it."
2,Very disappointed,"I bought this device because I am starting to travel internationally. I received the product a few days ago. I am not 100% happy with it. To start, the screen is very hard to read. The contrast setting really does not do anything to help read the screen. Have to strain my eyes and keep tilting the unit to avoid reflection to read. The backlight is useless too!! Very disappointing!!!There is no capability to enter more than one word at a time. It does have a selection of phrases based on category that can be selected.It does function fine as a translator, just not too easy to read, or move back and forth through options.I would give this a 2.5 out of 5.0. I feel that Franklin could have done much better with this product. Why make a translator device that is very difficult to read?If I was able to return it, I would. Definitely not worth the retail price of $230. Going to check out the Voyager III."
3,average,Overall is nice compact translator however the screen is very hard to read. They should have made the font display much larger.
2,Franklin TGA-490,"All in all it's good for beginners to get started.The TGA-490 is not programmed well. Quite a few of the phrases or words are out of order in most or all of the languages.The database is very limited; there are not many words.The crystal, in front of the display, scratches too easily causing difficulties in low light problems (visual difficulties)."
2,lousy light,"The translation and language portion of this product work fine. The problem is in the visibility of the screen. In the days when we can use a cell phone as a flashlight, this screen is very difficult to view even in good light. It's like going back to the early days of portable devices.I have some problems with the user interface, things like a next and previous button to return to a search you want to modify. But overall, you can find what you're looking for fairly easily."
1,Do not read this book for health purposes!,"This woman murdered 20-40 people in her facility. She was not a doctor; she was a total psychopath! She literally starved them to death; she also encouraged them to commit suicide; she performed her own autopsies and used cirrhosis of the liver as cause of death on a lot of her victims. She tortured and abused them. Her facility was out in the woods, away from people, so most of her victims died. Some managed to escape to neighboring homes to get help.If you are looking for a book on fasting for health reasons, do not look here for it! This book was written by a psychopathic murdering monster!!!"
1,Save Your Money...,"Beware...[...] Linda Hazzard, who called herself a ""Doctor"" was a sociopath who starved more than a dozen people to death. She was a thief who would gain power of attorney of her patients so she could rob them blind, literally taking their clothes, money, and jewelry for herself. Hazzard kept her ""patients"" as prisoners. She would beat their starving bodies with her fists (even their faces) and administer enemas for hours at the time, while they screamed in pain. She was a sadistic murderer. This book is filled with made up junk she used to entice people to her fasting facilities. Her words are not medically founded since she wasn't even a real doctor,or scientist. Additionally, the quality of this ""book"" is very poor. You can tell they used a copier to photocopy the library book, but a majority of the words are cut off. Not recommended at all..."
