3,Juniata River,I bought this book on the advice of a friend...It was an OK book but I had hoped to see something more of the tributaries of the river...since I summered on the raystown Branch.
4,Not the game for me.,"I am pretty obsessive about game buying. Before I bought Pirates!, I read just about every review I could find, and everyone (generally) seemed to like it. I was surprised, however, when i took this game home and got bored with it pretty rapidly. But this is not a bad game. It is a slow game. There is a lot to do, but none of it was compelling enough for me to really want to do it. The virtual world is huge, you can do a ton of things, but the mini games and the game in general is not that interesting. Because you'll be doing the same task over and over again, it starts to lose its meaning. But i come from the generation whose games are very ADD. If you have a little bit of patience (which I don't), and a bit of imagination, then this game might be the game for you. However, it certainly wasn't the game for me."
2,A very disappointing port of a good game,"I really enjoyed Sid Meier's Pirates! on the XBOX and so was looking forward to taking the same game on the go with the PSP version. I ended up disappointed because the PSP version isn't nearly as good. The main problems are the much smaller screen and the significantly longer load times. This results in my single biggest complaint: ship-to-ship combat takes place on a zoomed in version of the world map, rather than on a much more detailed small patch of ocean. The difference is palpable and the result is far worse.If you've never experienced the game before, you might be willing to put up with those problems because the underlying game is a lot of fun -- but anyone who has played it on a home console or the PC should skip this port."
2,Boring,"Based on the good reviews here and elsewhere, I purchased this game and was excited to play it. Unfortunately, I do not see what others find so fun about it. I found it extremely slow-moving and repetitive. You sail, fight, trade, dance....over, and over, and over. Boring-boring-boring. There are side quests, but they just do not make up for the overall simplicity and dragginess of the game."
2,repetitive and too easy,in two words: repetitive and boring. the gaming repeats 4 or 5 actions all the time without any evolution happening. u got a new ship and well u keep dominating the word as before. the game is really boring and the attempts to introduce some variation (dancing with the governors daughter or searching for thesaurus inland) just bring more repetition to the game. the graphics are really bad too without any kind of inovation. if u love pirates well there are no many other options for psp but maybe u should save the money for the next movie. this game is just going to make the time of waiting jonhhy deep longer...
5,"Fun game, but scratched and freezes up. Not very happy.",Got the game. Played for awhile then the game started to freeze and the whole PSP had to be shut off. Be careful when buying software from this site.
2,Strategy in need of an update,"This game is a media darling, but I couldn't help but feel like the gameplay and the graphics were old and outdated. The game seemed like something I would play on a PC in the mid 1990s. I know it's a remake of an older game, but I would have liked to have seen some more modern gameplay elements."
2,The Original Ten,"Oh boy. I'd stick with the original ten in the Bible. True, there have been recidivists in opposite direction, but no defense of the tenth commandment will prevail against the lack of inhibition of our elected leaders. There is a moral void at the center, and no poems can overcome kitsch and Krugerrands, not to mention a sensibility too timid to encounter the self in a mirror with anything but an ultra-refinement of conceited verse that won't work in a rough and tumble age..."
2,Not happy with Visioneer 7600 USB,"I tried to install the scanner on my computer which has Windows 98 second edition. The scanner software does not have the appropriate driver for the newer edition of Win98. The website does indicate that there is a problem. Even with updating the driver, installation was unsuccessful. I am returning the scanner to the store.Anyone buying this scanner should make sure that the installation software will recognize the updated Win98 drivers.Ram"
4,Good scanner,"Very easy to use. OCR software is great, handling my blurry text with only a few errors. Good quality photo scanning with software for adjusting the photos."
1,Defective,Purchased the unit and returtnerd it the same day. The software appeared not to be compatable with win 98. Anyway it did not work. The tech support was awfull. Returned the product andwould not recommend
1,terrible tech support,"I bought a Visioneer scanner, but have had nothing but problems with it. The software wouldn't install, despite my best efforts and many, many calls and emails with Visioneer's tech support. It may be a corrupted Paperport disk causing the problem, but the real problem is this: Visioneer has terrible, terrible tech support. They kept sending me maddening emails directing me to do things that didn't help one bit, often with suggestions that had NOTHING to do with the problem. One suggestion froze up my Pentium II computer. I am returning my scanner to Visioneer and will purchase another brand."
3,This scanner is not supported with Windows XP,"I've had this scanner for 2 years and have had good luck with it. Then my husband upgraded to Windows XP. Unfortunately, Visioneer does not support this scanner with Windows XP and I've had nothing but problems since the upgrade. The scanner driver locks up and sometimes I'm unable to print from the PaperPort software. This requires much rebooting to resolve itself and just because it prints or scans once doesn't mean it will do it again. I recommend you buy a newer model unless you have no plans on upgrading your OS for a few years."
2,Scanner did not work,The Visioneer One Touch 7600 Scanner was poorly packed. In addition it never worked. I did return to seller who expeditiously handled the complaint and immediately issued a full refund. I never found out why it did not work. Sorry!
5,The Zack Files,I really enjoyed this product! It was a relief that the dvd actually worked. I liked seeing the behind the scences feature. It was really cool!
1,Ripped Off,"When I was a little kid, I used to watch this show all the time. It's safe to say I was obsessed with it. When I discovered that somebody on amazon was selling it, without any hesitation whatsoever, I dug into my purse for my credit card, eager to bring back the pleasant childhood memories I had from watching this show. When it came in the mail, I popped it into my computer's disk drive. Not only did it take a while to find the files from the disk on my computer, but it also only allowed me to watch one episode. ONE episode. ONE.I was VERY disappointed."
5,Good clean fun for a little one!,I purchased this for my granddaughter who is 2 1/2 years old and she hasn't stopped playing it. She also loved getting it from the mailbox which by the way was full in just a few short days. Thankyou
5,This is an undiscovered gem for most,"On A Storyteller's Night never even got word of mouth on this side of the ocean,but in their home country,England and many parts of Europe they were very popular and one listen to this cd you'll know why.If you're a fan of melodic rock or commercial rock ALA Foreigner,REO,Kansas,etc.You'll absolutely love this! Better songwriting and songs that are majestic and captivating,one listen to the title track,Last Dance or possibly the best song you've never heard Les Morts Dansant and you'll be hooked.The rest of the album is equally on par,but the above three really stand out.Check these guys out I think you're in for a real treat."
3,Arrived damaged.,"Product arrived with safety nipple broken.......I cannot use the safety cord.It was ,however, the product I thought it would be and it works well."
4,Keeps the Rangers away!,Exactly what I needed. I hate sneaking out at night and trying to empty the grey water only to bump my head trying to shut it off when the camp host or ranger drives by with their headlights!Now I hook up a regular hose and extend it to the woods and drain away!
5,Nice to have.,Great addition to any RV. Use it at the campgrounds that allow gray water to be released. Easy to use.
4,Pretty Good Replacement,Purchased this to replace missing cap on RV. Works as expectedbut would like to see bigger nubs or perhaps 2 wings to makethis a little easier to put on and remove.
5,Valterra cap,"Nice product, made in Mexico, not China. It does the job, would recommend for one wanting the hose connection for grey water draining."
3,Interesting reading,"I was hoping this book covered more ""not so activitist"" ways to get attnetion from the press BUT it was still worth reading for anyone who does want to get the presses attention. Just remember to keep it within the law. Will read again for more insight."
3,good for pregnant and non pregnant folks with strong caveats,"Would have given 4.5 stars with strong caveats...LIKES: not the usual poses...nice sequencing...mostly ground based poses...soothing voice and music...great for even non-pregnant folks. DISLIKES: No modifications offered. Some of the mini-movement sequences area a tad bit too fast. ""Dynamic crow""--I disagree that there should be anything ""dynamic"" about crow pose for a pregnant woman. And a repeated standing to squatting sequence might make some pregnant women dizzy. If you follow it at your own speed and ability, it's a decent DVD. I do like how they qualify ""with prior yoga experience""...I agree."
4,i was even born yet****,"a great book with nice pictures and stories. i'm afraid the script printed didn't match what the actors' were saying. however, i still enjoyed the movie. this classic will live on forever. laugh & enjoy. ****"
5,Great business grade machine,The Brother 4750e Intellifax fax machine was bought to replace a Pitney Bowes business grade fax machine at our place of business. This is a great machine and has worked out for us without any problems. I would highly recommened this machine for your small business.
4,It was good,Pandora's Clock was a very good book with almost realistic facts that made it feel realistic.
2,An OK book until the disappointing ending,"At the end of this novel, we find that all the passengers have been infected with the virus. Luckily for them, the virus has mutated into a nonfatal strain. Mr. Nance doesn't seem to have realized that an entire population does not mutate spontaneously to produce a new, avirulent population. Mutations are random events that happen to individual organisms. This was an incredible letdown.Also, at the end of the novel, Captain Holland asks Rachel, one of the passengers, to marry him. Excuse me, he's known her for what, a few days, and he's decided he wants to spend the rest of his life with her? What is this, a Harlequin romance?I'd say the only good part of the novel was the start, where the plane is constantly being turned away from airports. That was well-plotted and written. Unfortunately Mr. Nance needs to do some homework on genetics, and get the rose-colored stars out of his eyes."
4,Pandoras Clock,Good book with a plot that keeps you reading. Mr. Nance knows aviation so it's also great reading for those with that interest.
4,Great Techno-Thriller,"This was my first book by Nance. I really enjoy reading airplane thrillers and Nance writes them expertly. This one has a really great premise, a virus loose on an airplane. This would be a great movie."
4,"Pretty Interesting, though the ending was a little unclear","This was a pretty entertaining book, and even though the flight jargon was a little thick, it didn't take away from the story. As usual with books with slightly complicated issues, though, the ending left a little to be desired, but I would read it again in the future anyway."
3,Starts with a bang...ends with a fizzle...,"Pandora's Clock starts on firm footing with an intriquing premise, the possibility of a ""doomsday virus"" being carried on a commercial airline flight. The first hundred pages of this book move along crisply, slowing building tension...but the introduction of some government type characters and the eventual shift of focus away from the crew and passengers of the airliner, and towards a CIA conspiracy ruins the book. The finale is a poorly thought out and very contrived turn of events that leaves you very disappointed. It's not a bad read if you let the first half of the book carry you through to the end, but nowhere near the quality of The Hot Zone or The Andromeda Strain."
2,Pandora's Clock,"I'm not a fan of thrillers, and found this one to be typical of the genre. I have to admit, I was worried that I wouldn't even be able to finish the book when I ran across this unintentionally hilarious sentence in chapter four, when the diplomat's assistant sees the tall, broad-shouldered pilot for the second time: ""The same vibrations that had shuddered through her back in Frankfort erupted again now with seismic force..."" Fortunately, I didn't notice any other writing along those lines, although the author did seem to be obsessed with beautiful, busty women. It's funny the way that male authors so often write about some average-looking, over-the-hill guy who ends up with a drop-dead gorgeous sweet young thing. Personally I would have found this book a lot more fun if the pilot had been a middle aged woman and the diplomat's assistant had been an Orlando Bloom clone!"
1,Waste of Money!,"This was a waste of money! Don't bother because not one soul in this god awful ""band"" has an ounce of talent."
1,false description,"CKY volume 2 is a great cd. Probably one of my favorites. Unfortunately, this isn't the cd I received. Therefore, do NOT order this cd through amazon because you will not receive a Volume 2. You will receive Viking Skull's Chapter 2 cd. I wanted the legit copy of volume 2 and this is what I got."
5,wow,"heres the story, i bought this for my cousin, and he opened it up and we listened to it, we played the prank phone calls in his car, and man, he was driving and almost ran off the road from laughing so hard. its the funniest thing i've ever heard in my life. the songs on disc one are great, all of them. great riffs by deron miller, and co. the x-mas songs are just FUBAR!!! trip through hell...i dont understand them, maybe the guys were drugs...oh well...enjoy, its great."
5,ok people,"This is viking skull volume two and not cky volume 2. i dont know who posted the pictures of cky volume two but this is not cky. Viking skull contains the drummer,jess margera, of cky but this is not cky music. This is a completely different band!!!!!!!"
4,... ... this is a very good read,"... This novel took me a couple of days to read, instead of my usual couple of hours, and held my interest throughout. I thought the characters were interesting and well drawn, not thin at all. And the 'villains', well, actually only one character, does not have a predicatable 'ending'. I've been sorely disappointed with some purchases lately, but not this one. Highly recommended."
4,A Little Slow But Well Worth the Time,"Alexandra is about a grandmother visiting her grandson on base while in the middle of the Chechen occupation. The movie is pretty slow as there's absolutely no action in it, but I think that's the point. This movie to me is more about the emotional. The relationships between the soldiers and how they react to having a ""motherly figure"" around. The relationship between Alexandra and her grandson and even a little insight into her relationship with her late husband. Most especially I found the nature of the relationship between the Chechens and Alexandra to be the most potent. This movie perfectly shows the uneasiness of relations involving the younger generation versus the older people who lived during soviet times and simply think of each other as ""comrades"". This film may be slow but it's well worth the time spent watching it especially if you're interested in the Russian-Chechen conflict."
2,Not What I Expected - Read The Details!,"The artist's name confused me -- I was looking for new music from ONE Eskimo when I bought this for my wife...It is a continuous rambling of electronic music, that basically sounds all the same... I decided to turn the CD into ""flying disk""..."
3,review of NY Yankees print,"I was a bit disappointed in the darkness of the prints and the size. Also, instead of sending the 3 5X7 prints in an envelope appropriate for size, they sent them in an extra large poster rolled tube, which curled the prints."
2,"Poor diagrams, sloppy text","This was the recommended textbook for my Neuroanatomy class, so I bought it. Turns out, it didn't help very much. Now, in general I am more of a notes person than a textbook person, but with this book I used it more seldomly than usual. For some reason, the text doesn't speak to me as well as other books, and the figures aren't as well-drawn as other books. I ended up buying Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain by Mark F. Bear. It has better writing, and clearer diagrams."
2,MX 518 FOR GAMING!?,"Logitec's mice absolutely blow for longevity. The scroll button is toast again after 5 months of gaming. I have been through 3 logitech mice in 1 1/2 years. There is no way to repair them since they are made as disposable. Guess Logitec mouse producers either don.t game or dont care. Im goin razor next, just not looking forward to having get used to a different feel mouse. As for 1600 DPI, what a waste of cash. Ive never found a use yet in all my gaming for anything more than 800 DPI."
4,Works good.,This mouse works good.The pointer is good and a lot of extra features I have not used yet.I did not give it all stars only because I hit a arrow button on the side by accident sometimes and it is a back button for the screen.Not a big deal but annoying.It could be just me.
5,Great mouse!,"I bought this as a replacement for a cheap RadioShack mouse that had been slowly dying on me. The difference was incredible!At first I was weary because I thought it would be really light; it's actually got a decent amount of weight to it, and feels quite sturdy.The on-the-fly DPI changing is great. You can set it (with SetPoint software) to up to 5 presets, anywhere from 400 to 1800 DPI, great for either extreme sniping or fast-twitch assault runs.The fact that it's wired is a relief as well, no more cursor freezing or skipping; everything tracks perfectly and smoothly.Lastly, it's EXTREMELY comfortable. The thumb rest and overall shape almost make me not want to take my hand off it.I definitely recommend this mouse."
5,Great Product.,Mouse was perfect condition and was packaged well. I was very satisfied with my order and would be more than happy to order again. A++
5,So comfortable,"I have always enjoyed the high quality of Logitech anything and this is no different. This mouse is so perfectly constructed that I barely realize I am using it. It glides super smooth, it is contoured almost perfectly for my hand and the DPI adjustment buttons don't get in the way at all. I highly recommend this mouse."
2,Get a Diamondback Razer 3G,"It's big and uncomfortalbe. Wish the big hump wasn't there. Hard to pick up when your hands on it. Comfortable for the first 30-45 minutes. Nowhere to put your pinky comfortably. I returned it and ordered a Diamondbck Razer 3G. Lighter weight, more erogonomic, fits left handed and right handed people. Same sensitivity. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!!!"
5,great gaming mouse,"this mouse is wonderful. if you love to game, then you will enjoy the 'ingame' sensitivity adjustment capabilities. The back button is well placed. I've found the forward button is a little out of reach for my short thumbs, but i hardly use that button anyway. All I can say is, get it, you will love it."
4,Good Gaming mouse,"I bought this mouse a year ago now and have been using it for gaming, work and web browsing. It's sturdy, light, and very accurate. It's also big which is good for me (large hands). The buttons are sturdy, I have never had a problem with the left click button, but after a year some of the plastic coating on the mouse's central piece is pealing, which makes it look likes it is shedding (not very nice).overall its a good gaming mouse. Will use it for a long time."
3,Overrated Mouse for Palmers,"Thought the mouse was overrated given the incredible amount of hype. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad mouse, but at the end of the day it's just like any other mouse with higher sensitivity. As a palmer, I thought that this mouse was too small even though it's immensely better than the G9 which I also owned (and have since given away also because it's WAY too small for me). While the mouse is not great for PC FPS gaming, I found it better than a lot of other mice for the PS3. Overall, might not be worth the $28 I paid but maybe closer to $17.50. Could be great for those with smaller hands."
4,mouse,"A well constructed easy feeling mouse. Lots of years out of the first one so I just replaced it, thats how much I like it"
1,Very uncomfortable,The right side of the mouse can't fit your Ring finger. very very uncomfortable. this is a 50 dollar mouse. c'mon?
2,"short term great, long term bad",This was great for about a year and half. Then I found the unibody left mouse button to become overly sensitive. I guess I could take it apart and try to increase the spring resistance. I've had other mice last much longer.
1,Stupid little things keep it down,"There are a few details that made me send this one back.1. A Mac won't even boot when the mouse is attached. Really, what USB mouse doesn't work on a Mac these days? Plus there are no drivers available for this particular mouse. I should have checked though. Can't use it on the home machine.2. On Windows the left and right main buttons aren't remappable, although there is no good reason for them not to be. This makes ambidextrous mousing impossible. Can't use it on the work machine.3. The installer CD doesn't support Windows 2000 Pro. I had to go to Logitech's site (not really up to Microsoft's standards) and download an installer. It wasn't a Windows 2000 specific installer, so I'm wondering why the installer on the CD is OS specific.I'm going to stick with Microsoft for work and get a Mighty Mouse from Apple for home."
2,I don't like it It just doesn't fit my hand right,"I have big hands. I have trouble with the right button clicking just by the weight of my finger resting on the button. In order to not click it I have to move forward till the tip of my finger is resting on the area in front of the button which then causes my hand to fall asleep like I said it just doesn't fit my hand right. I play video games so I'm using it for long periods of time. And the statement ""Metal"" refers to the plastic finish. HA! HA! HA! real cute."
5,Best Mouse for the buck hands down,I just got my mouse today I was ecstatic about the performance I had initial problems installing the mouse but after I unplugged it and plugged it in again the problems went away. I have to agree with my other comrades from this site this is the best mouse for the price and I have no problems whatsoever except for the look which I thought was the result from damage from shipping but it was designed like that so I have no complaints.
4,Good gaming mouse,My MX 510 oddly came with better software than this MX 518 but this is a good gaming mouse when you can find it for under $30.00. I would give it 5 stars except for the excessive price that often hovers at or above $70.00.
4,Good but not a gaming mouse,"This mouse has a great feel. I love the detentes of the wheel and for a right handed person, it's great. Button placement is pretty good. Now, if you're a gamer, I think this needs more buttons.The software that Logitech has provided has been a little ""crashy"" in Win7(64bit) in the past. I just reinstalled it w/o issue so far but I'm just reporting that it hasn't been perfect.I'd recommend this for the average computer user that wants a more ergonomic mouse or a general gamer, but I don't think this offers enough options for your pro-gamer."
5,Very Good Mouse,"This is a highly recommended mouse for gaming or any long duration of time spent on a computer. It fits into the contours of your hand very nicely. It has great sensitivity and it connects to the computer very well. I don't really care for the extra buttons on the side, though."
3,good not great,I like this mouse but some buttons seem a little spongy and I am not greatly impressed by quality just generally.It does work well for gaming with a few problems like above.
5,Great Mouse,"The box from amazon was like an anti-bomb box, protect the mouse I might say from falling of a buildind, jeje. The mouse is great, esy to set up, very light, the only thing I dont like is whe you change the dpi it doesnt say to which one you change it, you can configurate each button, it very nice."
4,Mouse,"The mouse isn't top of the line, but it's not bottom of the line either...a standard laser mouse is about 800 DPI.... this is about twice as good as a regular mouse. 2100 DPI is most commonly used by professional gamers.the ""quick switch"" option that allows you to go from high sensativity to low sensativity mid-game is useful, but hard to get used to."
3,"Excellent mouse, buttons not very durable","After 6 months my MX518 developed a problem with the left button. The button still works, but there is a werid creaking/scraping tactile feeling when you press it. I believe this is due to internal plastic parts deforming with time. All this mouse was used for was light browsing. I loved the mouse, but this is the second Logitech mouse with button problems (G5 is the other). I will research Microsoft's offerings before buying another MX518."
1,Poorly responsive junk,"i got this mouse to play Bejeweled Twist with (The most demanding game on a mouse that I regularly play). It has a poor response, stickiness and almost impossible to get to respond well, either moving too fast and over-correcting, or too slow and hard to align. It is no better than my 6-year old basic Microsoft mouse. Also, since Amazon doesn't sell it directly, expect problems returning it. Avoid this mouse. Get one you have tried out first."
1,This thing SUCKS!,"The moves cursor moves erratically when I move the mouse. This happens no matter what DPI I have it set on, or what kind of surpass I am using it on.I am running Windows 7 on a brand new laptop. This moves is worse than an old Genious mouse I bought for $5! Considering that this thing costs $30 +, this is a terrible buy!I have never encountered such an imprecise device - this is the most horrid mouse I have ever used! Maybe I did not get a standard product?"
1,MX518,"I have used several gaming mice over the course of the last few years, the mx518 being one of them. I play FPS games such as CS, Far Cry, Halo, etc. I've also used it to play WOW and other mmorpgs. The mouse has many amazing features, however it doesnt appear to stand up to intense use. For instance, after about two months the mouse stopped working in its full capacity. During gameplay the mouse skips across the screen, or sticks in one place. When I hold down the fire button and attempt to move the cursor, it barely moves, and when it does the control and speed are seriously compromised. At first, the mouse seemed to deserve a five, however after a while it seems to deteriorate very fast. Would not suggest any SERIOUS gamers buy this mouse. If you play occasionally sure, but if you play more than 2+ hours a day, find something else!!!!"
1,Avoid buying it,"after few months of using it, it started to lag badly, and the scroll wheel stopped working, I'll never buy logitech mouse again.."
2,logitech mouse,"This is my second mouse, I wore out the first one. I love these little ones they are good for gaming and everyday use you can't go wrong buying this. I get the blue or black it fits your hand without gramping-its a great mouse-I hope you try it. I love mine-you don't need a mouse pad to use it. Have fun! I hope this has help you out!!"
4,"Works very well, great precision","Great mouse, especially for the cost here on Amazon. I play FPS games (Counter Strike: Source, Battle Company: Bad Company 2), RTS (Dawn of War II, Starcraft II), and just general computer usage. I love it! A great mouse. Button placement isn't perfect beyond the main left and right buttons, but they are the main ones I use. The side, thumb buttons are useful for forward and backward when browsing, but I haven't found a use for them when gaming yet.All in all, an excellent mouse and I don't regret purchasing it at all."
4,great mouse,I love this mouse and almost everything about it. The only drawback on the design is the dps adjustment buttons being to far apart. Despite that this is still my gaming mouse of choice.
4,Optical vs Ball Type,"Excellent product, very responsive and ergonomic. Anxious to know how long it lasts. Ball type mouse was being replaced yearly."
2,Garbage,"While is mouse is certainly beautiful and works great when it is working, I have found it to be unreliable.The first one I purchased from Best Buy did not have a working left-mouse button. I returned it and got a replacement which worked great... for two months. The right-mouse button is now ""going away"", it is getting more and more difficult to register a click. It is at the point now where the mouse needs to be replaced."
5,Best Mouse in the Business,"I thought that this mouse would not work with my Mac. I could not get any of the buttons to work. I found out you just need to Uninstall the Logitech Control Center if you are having this problem and it works great! It is an amazing mouse. If you download USB Overdrive, you can apply most of the same functions to the buttons as you can with the Windows software. If you are in the market for a gaming mouse, a graphical mouse, or just a solid mouse in general, i would highly reccommend this one. It glides like it's on ice, on the fly sensitivity switching, and ultra precise tracking make this the best mouse on the market. at this price, it's a steal."
5,Good mouse,"I'm an ambidextrous mouse user and this mouse, although designed for a right hand, is also comfortable with the left. The smooth rubber sides on it are good and its very responsive. On the fly sensitivity adjustments are a great bonus, with no special software required to take advantage of it. I'm a gamer and am very picky about hardware... if there was a weakness with its performance I would have found it by now. It serves its purpose and looks nice too."
5,Great gaming mouse,This mouse has been awesome. The control is spot on and very smooth. The 'on the fly' pixel adjustment is really cool. You can switch it around during a game until you get the feel you are looking for.Highly recommended.
5,Excellent for price and great quality,"Don't buy another mouse because it has higher DPI. Sure the other mouses can reach 4500 DPI or 6000 DPI, but in reality, even 1000 DPI is too much for me. I bought this mouse because of its price (I got it for $25 on Black Friday) and boy was it a steal. This mouse is great quality and really easy to use: just plug in and play. If you want to make the buttons specialize in something else than their given functions, then pop in the CD and install... but once you pop in the CD and install the software (called SetPoint) to change the mouse buttons, you don't need the CD anymore. You can just click on the shortcut on your taskbar or desktop or whatever.I wish you could make the thumb buttons change the sensitivity while in-game because using the given sensitivity change buttons is a hassle (you have to move your middle finger into an awkward position to press them). I also wish you could go below 400 DPI.This mouse is a great buy otherwise!"
5,"Used for 5 years, still works great","I bought this a long time ago, likely when it first came out. I couldn't believe how responsive it was. Now, it works just as good as day one. The paint is coming off a little on the left side and on the metal logitech logo, but thats no big deal. If you're looking for a larger, solid mouse at a great price, this is it. I use it on a standard faux wood desk, not sure how it works on marble or granite, but it works great on all the surfaces ive tried."
4,GREAT MOUSE FOR PRICE,vERY GOOD GAMING MOUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. RUNS SMOOTH AND HAS ENOUGH SETTINGS TO HELP GIVE YOU AN EDGE.
4,Solid,"Solid weight, nice buttons. All the buttons come in handy for WoW and regular use. There is an issue for Mac usage: out of the box the page up and down buttons control the tracking resolution, and the included CD is not listed as including a Mac driver. SteerMouse can reset the buttons, ControllerMate can not."
3,Logitech MX518 review,"I bought it to replace my G5 that I had for 5 years and I can only say that I miss my G5, this MX518 feels a little cheap, its not as accurate as my old G5, maybe I am just used to a better quality mouse.It works fine, just does not feel expensive in any way shape or form."
2,Lasted a year,Mine crapped out after a year and in such a way that I blamed my computer for it. The mouse randomly froze up for <3 seconds at a time could happen once a day or 10 times a day. I thought I might have a virus so I scanned every thing and planned on reformating.When I searched it on logitechs forums it turns out this is a very common problem.Pro's: I like the shape/button location and simple design.Cons: Short life span
3,Decent,I bought this mouse for gaming and it worked well. The size is too big in my opinion. Software is ok.
2,Second one of these...Keeps dropping connection..POS!!!!,These mice are pieces of crap. I have had two. The first lasted about a year and then started randomly dropping the connection. It is more than annoying to be in the middle of a game and have your mouse suddenly stop working for 5 seconds while is drops the connection and reconnects itself. The second mouse I bought in May and it has already started doing the same thing. I am in contact with Logitech now. They are going to replace it and send another one but I still have to ship it to them and wait for it to be returned.If the return one doesn't work I will be dropping Logitech permanently.
5,No lagging and move very smoothly,"I've used this mouse for almost 6 months so far. It has been great, the clicks are perfect and the overall feeling is very good. No lagging and move very smoothly. There are no cons to this mouse and thats why I love it."
3,it's a mouse,"Even after all these years...I am not sure about it. I am not sure about the ergonomics, I am not sure about the comfort level. I am not certain the buttons do add that much functionality. However, it does eliminate the need for a mouse pad. It's not special in any way."
2,"Too Large, Erratic","If you have big guy hands you will love this. My small girl-hands, however, are not very happy. I am in early Carpal Tunnel and the large size mouse makes it more painful, but even without that the mouse not ideal for normal comfort. I have had logitech mice before using set-point software. This mouse is very erratic and difficult to control no matter how you change the settings. Guess you get what you pay for. Shame on Logitech for even marketing such an inferior product."
2,All the buttons doesn't work,"Update to review. After updating the driver for a plug-in application called SteerMouse, this mouse works just fine.Former review: All the buttons won't work with my Mac Pro. The side buttons, the right and left and scroll wheel work just fine. But the three other smaller buttons simply will not work."
5,Ignore The Ignorance - Professional SC2 Gamer,"I'm a Grand Master Zerg in the Starcraft II scene and have been using this mouse for over a year and it's been fantastic.For the price I don't think there can be any other comparison.It's quick, durable, and very sensitive. My next upgrade will be the Black Mamba but I would use this before anything else for the price, this is an excellent mouse overall."
4,razor replacement,"Logitech's Gaming Optical Mouse is what I chose to replace my worn down optical razor mouse from two years ago. It doesn't have as many side buttons as the razor did, but it was very rare for me to use all the buttons. Leaning around corners with this mouse is taking a bit to get used to doing. For the slightly discounted price I got this mouse for I am very pleased with how it does in 1st person shooters."
4,Improved FPS gaming,"Finally ejected the pc mftr mouse and replaced with one to help with hitting what is being aimed at in FPS games. (COD4&5, BF2, TF2, JK2, etc.)The in-game adjustable sensitivity is great when one is carrying multi primary weapons in one pack. It is nice to hit sniping & run-gunning w/o having to go out-o-game to change sensitivity. The mouse is comfortable in the hand (or large mitt as this writer has!) and the controls all have a very good sensitivity to the single-hand use.The only thing that would be appreciated is if Logitech would NOT load their entire keyboard/mouse/etc software for a single product. (Just don't like having unused dlls & execs on the system. Call it old-fashioned.)Highly recommended considering there are some which are higher priced."
5,Best Mouse Ever,"TheLogitech MX 518 High Performance Optical Gaming Mouse (Metal)is the best mouse I've ever used. it doesn't have some of the fancier features of its big brother theLogitech G5 Laser Mouse (Blue/Black)who has a customizable wight tray. but this mouse is the smoothest mouse i've used, with it's plethora of buttons. which I especially like the forward and backwards buttons for browsing through windows. and they are all fully customizable. the on the fly sensitivity switching works well, and is also fully programmable with the included, but not necessary software(you can still use the sensitivity switching without the software). this is by far the best mouse you'll ever get. you won't regret it!"
4,Great gaming mouse...,"It's a great mouse... I like the design, moves very smoothly, has buttons in the right location and let's you choose different dpis on just a click...Good cost vs value...I could use more buttons but you can't have it all, hehe..."
4,Great mouse,"A great mouse overall, however the two main mouse buttons tend to wear out after six months to a year of repeated use. This in turn causes mouse clicks to require much more pressure than initially required."
4,Nice. Real nice.,"Even by demoing this at Best Buy, or trying it out at a friend's house you can tell that if you're looking for near perfection in a gaming mouse, this mouse will answer your prayers for some $40 or your money. The only drawback I find in this mouse is the fact that it has a cord that can tangle, get caught, and choke you (no seriously my friend was trying to grab the mouse and I lifted it up and started waving it in the air so he couldn't get it, and it ended up wrapping around my neck). Still, not all wireless controllers and mouses are that good--batteries put annoying limitations, and sometimes the mouse's receptor has trouble getting the signal from the USB trasmitter thing. But overall this is a great choice. Highly reccomended for gamers--works well with WoW (World of Warcraft) and other MMORPG's like Guildwars and such. I hope this review was helpful to you (and I'm not who you think I am--lol)."
5,Nice and simple...,"Great mouse for anyone who doesn't care for wireless. Responsive, precise, and ergonomic. Looks great too."
5,Absolute perfection,"This mouse is amazing. It looks great, feels great, it's incredibly precise, and the adjustable sensitivity makes it perfect for any situation in any game, along with doing artwork or anything else. If you're wondering whether or not you should buy this mouse, stop now. Just buy it."
3,A good replacement mouse for gamers,Not the best mouse ever made for PC gamers but it does the job. Plug and play feature; I didn't bother installing the CD that came with the package (MS Windows Xp did the rest in installing the mouse). I had the Wolfking Trooper gaming mouse for two years and it recently quit on me - the left clicker broke (too much Modern Warfare and Battlefield games). I still have my doubts on how long will this mouse last. I picked this mouse because I'm on a budget and I would like to give it a shot. Hope for the best!
2,Mine quit working in just months,"just months after purchase, mine just stopped lighting up. I am going to try the Logitech warranty process."
2,faulty wiring...,"Overall I would grade the look and feel OK for the price. It glides pretty well over my flat desk without a mouse pad. Also, I'm having 100% compatibility with my MacBook Pro Plug-n-Play, no drivers to install.When it worked consistently it was a very decent mouse... after one year usage, the mouse intermittently loses connection making this a ""game over mouse"" rather than a gaming mouse.I believe the problem is durability with wiring at the top of the mouse."
4,Enjoy using this mouse,"It's a great mouse. I've also been using on of Logitech's mice with the dual mode free spin scroll wheel, and so that's the only thing I would say is lacking from the mouse. The G500 has that, so maybe I'll get that next time I need a new mouse."
5,best mouse I've ever had,"This mouse is great for gaming and normal use, I love how you can use it to scroll through windows and change the sensitivity of movement, It is also very nice to be able to customize the buttons on the mouse for other uses. I also love this mouse for gaming, the side buttons make games alot easier, due to being able to map other commands onto them, making things much easier. I would highly recommend getting this mouse, its worth the money"
5,Best mouse ever made!,I original bought the older MX510 mouse a few years back. I wanted a mouse with as many button as possible and wasn't wireless. Didn't feel like changing batteries. After quite a few years of great usage it started showing its age and I decided to upgrade to its newest version. So far its just as good as the older version but with better performance (movement response time).I hope to get just as many years out of this one.
5,"MX performance, MX value","Great mouse, very easy to use, glides over any surface, very responsive- exactly what a hardcore gamer like me needed. My boss at work is very unhappy with my work because I'm spending more time playing on my PC than working!This logitech mouse and GTA San andreas would be answerable if I lose my job!!! :)"
2,poor buttons,Nice and comfortable mouse but poor durability of buttons. Only good for about half a year and then the right and left buttons started to wear out.
4,Logitech MX518 Gaming Optical Mouse,"This optical gaming mouse is awesome and everything I'd expected to see. The dpi is excellent and I never have mouse lag. Unfortunately for most video games, the MX510 would be good enough. I had an MX510 and I do not see much difference from the 518."
5,Excellent!,"This is by far one of the best mice for gamers. I've had the MX510 and G15 before, and I think this one is superior to both of them. I love the extra buttons and on on-the-fly sensitivity features!"
5,Awesome mouse,"I would recommend this mouse. I bought it to replace an old mouse (It was the cheapest logitech mouse I could find), but ended up putting it on my gaming rig. The resolution switcher buttons really make BF2 a lot easier to play. This is a great mouse."
5,"comfortable, accurate, fast, adjustable sensitivity","Great mouse, smooth, fits my hand perfectly, plenty of control with the many buttons.Might not fit everyones hand just right."
1,Broke after a month,"Broke after 1 month, scroll wheel died off. button under the wheel stopped working after a day. very poor quality overall. bought it because of high reviews. now back to a4tech x7. best mouse ever. MX 518 is just waste of money. don't buy."
3,"Solid mouse, but prone to cord problems","I have owned four of these mice over the past several years.They perform well, but they all have a short lifespan with me due to problems with the cord.It appears that after so much use, the wiring becomes loose and frequently disconnects.After sending the original mouse back RMA, I received a replacement that did the same thing.I bought another to replace Logitech's replacement, but that too had to be sent back RMA.The fourth mouse is now having the same issues again.Logitech was easy to deal with for the most part regarding replacements, but four failed mice in a 4 year period seems problematic.I don't abuse the mouse, but it does get used often. I suspect that if this was a light use mouse, it would be a great mouse for you."
3,Great mouse,"This is an awesome item, I love it but the reasonw why I gave it 3/5 is because I recieved a factory damaged product. I was gave a refund and then went and bought the same mouse from a retail store near by. If I didnt have problems from the beginning I would surely have rated it a 5/5"
4,Great mouse for gaming,"This is a great mouse for gaming, especially because it has two buttons that control the sensitivity on-demand. It has three sensitivity levels , which is great for first person shooters. Might be an overkill for daily usage."
4,"Excellent Linux support, but one unrelated quirk.","For the most part this is a great mouse. The only issue I've had is that when running Windows XP the mouse wheel tends to have some backlash now and then. By that I mean when scrolling down using the wheel, the window will occasionally scroll back up by a mouse wheel increment. It appears to be a software thing since I have not had the problem when running Linux ( Gnome/Fedora 8 ).The Linux support is fantastic by the way - plugged it in without having to install any additional software and the +/- buttons change the sampling speed without any issue."
5,It does what I wanted it to do,"I am an IT Administrator and spend ALOT of time on the computer. I initially bought one of these mice for my work PC. The install was easy, and I had no problems. I love the back/forward button for my web browsing, but even more, the application switch. I'm a big gamer at home, so I splurged and bought a 2nd one for the mouse sensitivity at my fingertips."
2,Great mouse for 5 months,"Having had two mx510 mice expiring on me within a year, I chose to purchase an mx518. When it works, it's a great mouse but suffers from the same problem as every other logitech mouse, weak mouse contacts. This has been marketed as a pro gaming mouse and yet the durability is shockingly poor. For 40.00 I expect more and the whole problem can be cured by upgrading the contact which is manufactured by Micron Industries. Logitech obviously don't see this as a problem despite the fact that this issue looms large in gaming forums. Logitech have lost me as a customer so will be buying a Razor Copperhead with my refund!"
2,Awsome mouse Horrible mouse button.,"I purchased my first mx518 about 7 months ago. Did awsome, pwned some noobs in cs:s and what not. Great for photoshop and other programs. Couldn't get over the fact that it had adjustable sensitivity on the fly. However, about 3.5 months after i had the mouse, the left mouse button began failing. Opened the mouse up and there is of course a sensor there. Looked online to see if i could find a replacement and had no luck. I went and purchased another one of these thinking i would have better luck. Had it for a month and a half and, dun dun dun, same problem on the second mouse. No problems w/ my 3 year old wireless mouse that is part of the mx duo lol."
5,execellent mouse,"This mouse looks even better in person, the designs looks nice and when using it feels nice in your hand. very good quality mouse"
4,"Great mouse, not the best material.","Had this mouse for about 2 years now still works great. The only problem with it is the material the buttons are made out of. After a couple weeks of use I noticed a build up of ""crud"" around the edges of the buttons. I saw that at least one other reviewer had this problem and stated it was from the buttons wearing down. However I believe the crud is actually just dead skin cells from your fingers that cling to the button's surface. As long as your not super greasy and you clean the buttons every now and then, you should be able to get a fair time out of the mouse for the price. If let the crud build up, it's obviously going to cause problems when it sticks in the cracks of the buttons. As for cleaning I just run a q-tip around the edges and it's good as new."
4,Owner,"I really love this mouse and have been using is for the last 18 months. However, I do have a few complaints to share with you. After about 6 months of use, the left button became sticky, and it was had to feel when I was clicking or if I was clicking at all, even though the detection worked fine, this must have been a problem with the plastic. My second complaint is that the dpi could be a little higher, for the price, 1800 dpi is a little low."
5,Best Gaming Mouse Ever!,"I have been PC gaming for years and this is the best gaming mouse I have ever owned. I literally have four of these I like them so much. Unfortunately it looks like after many years Logitech is phasing this model out and replacing it with the G400, which looks just as good or better. I will keep on rocking my MX 518s until they get to the point where I need a replacement!"
3,"Great mouse, don't buy it from here","newegg has it for a lot cheaper, I remember paying $40 for it 3 years ago.I got one 3 years ago, it's a great mouse, but the outside of it started peeling (the black stuff) so it looked nasty and crusty. The cable in the front of the mouse gave out after 3 years of regular use.Not recommended. Overpriced- look at some Razr mice, the mouse really doesn't make all that much of a difference- although this one is really good. It just took a crap so I replaced it with a $10 mouse from the same company."
5,Great mouse for the money.,"I just bought this mouse and love it. I use it playing Battlefield BC2. I was able to setup the buttons to perform tasks I usually have to place my hand in odd positions to accomplish. The mouse is smooth, doesn't skip, and very responsive. I LOVE the look of the mouse. I also love the ability to change the sensitivity on the fly. Sometimes I tend to move too quickly when shooting long ranges. I am able to slow movement down instantly. The first time I used this mouse I doubled my kill count in BC2.One bad thing (but not bad enough to drop the rating a star): This mouse is a bit large. If you have small hands you may not like it. I have gotten used to the size. I use a small mouse at work all day, so it is a matter of getting used to it. I love this mouse. I usually hate this style of mouse (hand-specific with buttons by the thumb) but I really like this mouse."
5,Good all around mouse,"Good for gaming. Good for plain ol' working on the computer. It is not wireless but the cable is pretty long and seldom gets in the way. Very Reliable, especially wen compared to wireless mouses (even more so in the context of gaming)"
5,Great Gaming Mouse,"I really enjoy this mouse, the shape of the mouse is perfect for the placement of my hand. The buttons are in perfect reach for ease of use. I have used this mouse for years in multiple different games ranging from MMORPG's to FPS's to RTS's. The buttons work great for quick access.I did notice that after 3 years, the mouse usb ""died"". The mouse still worked but randomly the mouse would ""disconnect"" and then reconnect in a matter of a couple seconds. Sometimes it would repeat this 2 times in a row. While playing games this gets frustrating, so I just bought a new one of these mice, and it works great. :)"
4,Good mouse for a cheap price.,"This mouse is a good looking mouse and very easy to use. It's accurate with very small movement for gaming, such as sniping. I found the sensitivity buttons on the mouse very useful and the forward and backward buttons useful for internet browsing. Overall a good product."
3,Issue on glass like surfaces,"Over all good but does not work well on transparent glass or acrylic surfaces. Need to have mouse pad if it was the case. Checked the settings but nothing available to correct it. Not sure why this particular mouse is so sensitive. I also do have Logitech RX1500 mouse but does not have any such issues. Other than this, grip is comfortable with extra buttons appropriately placed. By the way, I am not a gamer, hence have no feed back for gaming related issues."
1,Something wrong with this mouse,"this mouth is great when it works.I got the first mouse, and after a year or so some buttons stopped to work.I got the second mouse, and after few month the right click button stopped working and became absolutly worthless, because you cannot assign right click to any other button."
1,Can't Take the Pressure,"I burned through 2 of these MX518's, the first one I bought and the replacement the company sent. It took about three months apiece. They work great to start but if you have anything but a soft touch they can't take it. And I don't mean abuse-Just serious use. If you advertise yourself as a GAMING mouse...HELLO-you'd better be able to handle serious gaming. I'm not even going to go through the hassle of trying to get ANOTHER replacement. If I had it to do all over again I'd start with another brand!"
2,Built Poorly to Last Shortly,"I got the mouse when i completely redid my art studio over, new custom pc the works. Money was no concern as long as what i was buying would be you know... Good. This mouse worked like a gift from the Gods for about 1 year, then oddly enough it started to gradually become a dump from the Gods.The laser would start turning off randomly, which was very annoying, in addition it got to the point when the laser while on wouldn't react at all. It would only blip back and forth shortly on the screen. I was sadly disappointed in the least considering i'm not using a mouse over 6 years old that i spent 15 dollars on... and its working flawlessly...In short great mouse outa the box... Don't rely on it for the long run. Seriously its like Fruit Strips Gum;""OH WOW THIS IS REALLY GOOD!!!!(1 min later) ""Aw....""Get something else. Not to dis Logitech cause their products are always... (till this one) perfect. The 15 dollar mouse is Logitech.Just stay away from this mouse..."
5,Nice,"It's great for gaming, and love the slick look and feel. You have to get used to it though, since the shape of it makes you move it differently."
1,WARNING THIS TOY OVERHEATS!,One of my children received this toy for Christmas yesterday. We put in brand new batteries and it worked great then an hour later it wouldn't work. We assumed a bad batch of batteries. Opened the back to replace the batteries and noted bulging batteries. Still assumed bad batteries. Replaced batteries and within an HOUR with the toy TURNED OFF we noticed a hot plastic smell. Robot was VERY HOT. It had MELTED the battery compartment. We are contacting the store and manufacturer but please be aware!
3,Good but discs sometimes get stuck,"This is a pretty good toy although the discs seems to get stuck and don't shoot out all the time. We usually have to readjust and then usually it will work, althoufh sometimes we have to adjust the discs three or four times before they will come out. It would also be nice if they had a volume control. It is a little loud."
1,A piece of Junk that Did not Work AT ALL!!!!,"My son got this for Christmas yesterday! What a disappointment it was when we put new batteries in, turned it on and NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY nothing happened! This is a piece of junk sold by Young Explorer.We bought this Robot from Young Explorer, which is now issuing us a refund, which will take a while. After telling them that we will never buy anything from Young Explorer again, the customer service person said: ""Have a Good Day!""I know it is the manufacturer's fault, but Young Explorer should be able to stand behind the toys they sell and make sure they are good quality toys."
5,"Great book about all natural, whole raw foods for Dogs","This is a really great book if you are thinking that whole foods is so good for humans, why don't we feed our dogs a canine version?The author goes into why and how for doing a whole foods diet for our canine friends. It covers what dogs need in their diet and what foods work best to meet this need. Discussion includes supplements, where to get them, and how to prepare the various portions of the diet so our dogs get the most good from it.The author also includes sample diet pages for several weights of dog and pages for working out diets for our own dogs.Very interesting read."
3,Common Sense book,"I read this book out of curiosity and looking for a better diet for my pet. The ideas are based on common sense and it is tough, at times, to get through the authors personal belief system on the subject. Her writing does not seem to come from any professional background or research, making it all a bit hard to swallow. It does seem logical that dogs and cats should not eat what the food stores pass as edible food, but maybe humans should not as well. A bit more thought and academic dietary training might have made the book more substantial."
2,Please ship faster.,I love the product but the package is taking to long to ship. Please let me know what the issue is. thank you.Thank you.Karla.
4,A Concise Guide for Preparing for HFI Certification,"The text provides a wealth of information that helps the candidate focus on the concepts necessary to pass the written portion of the HFI certification exam. The chapters were brief, but to the point, and ended in an important test over the covered material."
4,It is definitely different - some good attitude...,"Gasoline Jesus is my favorite song here - the attitude in the lyrics and guitar. Definitely not pop music! Oh yeah, and don't try and dance to it. My suggestion, a big leather chair and a glass of whisky! (Or in the car, without whisky of course.) Good stuff."
3,For Class,"This book came as promised and in great condition. However, if you are looking for light reading or a way to get a better understanding of Spanish. I would not recommend this book, it is dated and the story it cheesy at best."
3,"nice, adds more size than I thought, and have to re-fit/re-seat it often.","This really makes a large phone even larger. Probably much better protection that the old elago slim fit it replaces. It is rubberized, so doesn't slip into pockets like the elago one did. I have had it for a few days now, and noticed that about 30% of time I pull from my pocket I have to re-fit the edges or back covering.I like the looks of it. Buttons work fine volume rocker and power buttons work fine through the rubber membrane on sides. The S-Pen can be hard to remove."
1,Deceptive,"Be forewarned. Despite the Catholic trappings, this book is an anti-Catholic delight. It rages against Church authority, tradition, Scripture. All the predictable moral buttons are pushed. Everything authentically Catholic is dimissed as narrow, repressive, etc.What we're left with is a ""Catholicism"" so vague that Oprah's book club looks firmer."
4,Good for a quick fix,Good if your short on time and don't have the typical 30-60 minutes available for yoga.
5,Husband has neck issues,"It has short workouts that are perfect for working certain areas and are not too long. Stretch and work an area, then move on."
5,What problems?,Had it for a week now. I'm not experiencing the same problems others are reporting with it. I don't have any problems getting to any of the buttons. Maybe they just have stubby fingers? I dunno. Everything works fine for me.
2,Not worth it!,"This book is poorly written and over-priced. It only took me a few minutes to read this pamphlet on Malt-a-poo's, and I didn't gain any useful insight into the breed. I'm sure that the author is knowledgeable about these dogs, but she didn't convey that in this publication. In fact, I was so distracted by the spelling, grammatical, and punctuation errors that I found it hard to read.The book did have two positives though. I liked the pictures of Hilton's Malt-a-poos and the information about size of the dogs (often Malta-a-poos grow larger than either of their parents).Before I read this book, I was considering also buying Hilton's book about puppy development, but now I definitely will not!I feel this book was a waste of money."
2,Not Worth It,I completely agree with the prior review. This book is certianly not worth over $10. Don't waste the money.
2,Definitely NOT worth the price!,"This book is only 33 pages long and several of the pages are just pictures of the Author's dogs. There is no factual or research based information in the entire book. It is simply based on the Author's opinions through her experience of owning several maltipoos (which she points out is correctly spelled Malt a poo). You can find more useful information on the internet for free so don't waste your money on this one! Maybe at the time it was written there were not many resources on the internet, but now this book is virtually useless. I have never given a book a bad review before but unfortunately I felt it was necessary in this case. I am sure the Author had good intentions but definitely can't justify the high price of over $20!"
1,Disappointed,"It's too bad that there aren't any other books on Maltepoos because although this book has a few good parts, it can be read in about 15 minutes and is certainly not worth the price. I got Puppies for Dummies that I've been reading for a week and still not done and got great information for the same price."
3,Again...!,"Marco continues to provide a good, basic, pretty well rounded coverage of Delphi/Kylix development. But as with most of his books this book is sparse on detail and skirts around a lot of real world development topics.For the beginner it is probably better to buy marco's ""Mastering Delphi <insert version>"" as this book does not add much that is Kylix specific."
3,clown shoes,"I bought these at a really great price ($30) because they only had sizes 6 and 9. I normally wear a 8 or 81/2 and these are 9, so I thought what the hay. I really love skechers, and in the pic they look nice, but when I put them on they are TOO roomy in the toe area (width and length). Looking down at them they looked very long, like clown shoes! I'm pretty disappointed. Maybe in a much smaller size the wouldn't look that way..."
1,HP 58 cartridge received was 7 years old,"Seriously, this vendor stinks! The cartridge did not come in a box; only in the foil envelope which is normally within a box. The date on the foil envelope was Oct04. Whether this was the manufacture date or the expiration date it makes no difference. This cartridge was much too old (more than 7 years), and it speaks very poorly of this vendor, pcInk, to try and sell it. I requested a return which they honored, but with a shipping label with which I had to pay for the return shipping, although I stated that the item received was different than what was advertised. Well, its not worth arguing with them about $3 return postage, but I'll never buy from them again. Be wary if you decide to buy from pcInk."
2,4 YEARS OLD,"2008! Seriously - this is NEW? I ordered 3 of HP#58 ink cartridges. They were supposed to be NEW! They arrived in the individual wrappers - and were unopened - so I guess some would say they were ""new"" as they haven't been used before. However the date on them was 2008! When I ordered NEW I expected something NEW!"
2,Arrived much later than other ink cartridges I ordered,"When it arrived it was not in it's original box and I do not know the expiration date .I am currently not ready to use it, and do not want to open the foil package andthere is no expiration date on the outside."
4,Cartridge,"As newer and more efficent printers are on the market, it is nice to see you can still get ink for the older ones, thanks"
1,OUTDATED INK Cartridges,"I ordered the #58 HP INK Photo cartridge. It arrived quickly.When i opened the cartridge , i saw that the EXP. CODE/or BEST USE BY code was SEPT 2008. I purchased the item on JULY 2010. I contacted the company and they said that it was listed on their page that the cartridges had old date codes. I COULD NOT FIND THAT INFO ANYWHERE ON THEIR SITE. Had i known this , I would NOT have purchased and OLD print cartridge. They were very quick to email me a return postage form so i may get my money refunded. I will see how quickly they refund my money. BE WARNED THE PRINT CARTRIDGES HAVE OLD CODE DATES THAT IS WHY THEY ARE SO INEXPENSIVE."
4,"This is the ""Photo Cartridge""","HP No. 58 Photo Cartridge (C6658AN) .... This item is not listed/technical specs. corrrectly..... It is a Photo Cartridge which replaces the black cartridge in a printer.... What it has is: black, + magenta(photo) and Cyan (photo).... This is in additon to the tri-color cartridge, thus giving;.... 6 color (cyan, magenta, yellow,+ (this cartrige, #58) black ,magenta(photo) and Cyan (photo).... I am going to try this in my HP 550 and will see and write my results. I have purchased the refill inks (way, way less $ ...like 10-20% of the cost, 80% less) and it has the ink for the Photo Cartridge. So I want to try it. I will write back with my opinion.Scott"
5,Good stuff low price,Good stuff at a low price is just what people need today. Consider yourself as one who helps in these tight money times.
5,It's a No No to Kiss a Rhino--Gotta Love Roger Day!,"After seeing Day in Savannah in concert with my first ever Pre-K class, I had to keep singing the songs with my kids. I purchased this CD as well as his Rock n' Roll Rodeo, and listened to it a few times a week. I even allowed the children to work the CD player themselves as they came to know their favorite song numbers (#2, #3, and #4 for the most part)."
5,Orchestral Masterpieces,"These Four Symphonies by Schubert are perhaps his best, with the 8th 'The Unfinished', and #9 'The Great' perhaps being the best known. But the Mozartean #5 and the 'Tragic' #4 are little gems that showcase Schubert's genius as well.Dover's edition is taken from the complete works of Schubert as printed by Breitkopf and Hartel. The editor of this edition of the symphonies was no less a musician than Johannes Brahms! A fine edition, excellent for study and following along while the music plays. Recommended!"
2,There are better choices,"First, the good news: HP supports this printer, so you can get paper and ink for many years to come. And it prints borderless 4x6 prints in a matter of seconds.Unfortunately, there is a lot of bad news about this printer. First, the color tone is poor. Second, the drivers are not fully XP compatible, which caused some instability for me. Third, the card reader is virtually worthless. It can take an hour just to read DPOF prints. Four, the per-print cost is moderately high.For the same money, buy the vastly superior Hi-Touch Imaging dye-sub printers, which produce better prints at a lower cost per-print."
4,Great for novices and travellers,"The printer is highly suitable for non-PC environments and for those on the go. The HP Photosmart 130's affordable price, support for the main digicam storage media, ""no-brainer"" operation and quality output also make it a good buy for novice and intermediate digital camera users who are looking for a photo printer.Pros: Portable, no PC required, quality output.Cons: Printing costs can get expensive, takes 2.5 minutes to produce a 4R print."
2,Clumsy Print Options,"This is just an okay photo printer. The colors are not vibrant. The main complaint I have is that this printer does not have a screen that lets you preview and select the photo you want to print. Instead, the printer assigns a number to each photo contained on your memory card that is DIFFERENT from the number the camera assigns to each photo. The inconsistent numbering systems make it difficult to select the photo you want to print. If you use a memory card that can contain 100 or more photos, this becomes a big problem if you don't want to print all of the photos on your card. The only way to deal with this issue is to print index cards to discover the number assigned to your photo by the printer, but that means wasting your expensive printer ink and paper. I'd suggest buying another photoprinter that either uses the same photo numbering system as your camera or has a preview screen."
5,I love it!!!,"I received this item for Christmas and it is one present that is not collecting dust. I purchased a camcorder carrying case and I pack the digital camara, paper and extra ink and the printer with me to every function. Everyone instantly gets copies of the shots they want. No more being hounded for my negatives."
1,Driver Conflict Problems,"A fine product, as long as you do not try to attach it to your PC, especially (if like mine) you have several other USB driven devices. Apparently HP has had a problem with ""mass storage driver"" conflicts with its Photosmart line for at least two years now, and customer support for resolving them is laughable: the problem is always the other item, not their printer. Of particular note is the GoBack program that comes packaged with Norton Systemworks - HP hates it and crashes your system. It also has problems with CDRW devices. After 10 days of frustration, I gave up an returned it to them. I am still looking for a small photo printer I can use as a dedicated device that does NOT conflict with rest of my hardware & software."
2,Misleading..,I received the wrong edition of a book I had bought. The picture posted with the review was not the same book.
5,The best book out there for review of derm meds,"This is the best book out there for listing meds used in various conditions in dermatology. Has dosages, available sizes, comparisons, charts, tables, etc. Very in depth (for example lists known sensitizers in various known products for quick reference). Great pocket book for any resident or practing derm.Michael J. Crowe"
3,Interesting morality play,"TWC is an entertaining episode where a female hologram is able to kill with her touch. This is also one of the first episodes where Spock is in charge of the Enterprise while Kirk is out. LTBYLB is the episode with a ""message"". Two aliens ( painted half black and half white but on opposite sides of the face) are fighting. Has some concentration camp mentions."
3,Paper not Plastic,"I thought the material would be a little more durable. It looks like it would be black plastic, however it's paper. Not what I expected, but still does the job"
2,Description is inaccurate. Does not have Infopocket.,"These folders do not have the Infopocket as described. Priced fairly I guess, but I returned them because I wanted the Infopocket type."
2,Missing folders,"Just like the other reviewer, the box was missing folders. In my case there were only 20 instead of 25."
1,a waste of money,This camera does a terrible job. It is even difficult to aim it at the spot you want to photograph. You are better off with a single use water resistant camera than with this piece of junk.
4,Interesting WWII tale from co-creator of THE PRISONER,"If you know THE PRISONER, then you know the premise. That national security agencies operate remote locations to sequester those who ""know too much"" to be left walking around, susceptible to capture and interrogation, or treason.In this case, it's not a stylish TV mystery, but a WWII spy thriller. Though I think calling it a thriller is a bit of a reach. I found an old 1970s copy of this book, and plodded through it. Despite a lack of thrilling action, it's a fascinating back story of a little-known detail of the great war, rather like the memoirs of the explosives officer that formed the basis of Thames Television's nail-bitingDanger UXBseries. Like the work that these poor individuals have to perform, the novel is rather sad and dreary, like the ""cooler"" presented in the book."
5,Simply The Greatest,"This album is my favorite of Airto's. Let's face it, he is one of the greatest percussionists of all recorded artists. In addition to winning numerous Downbeat awards as best percusionists, he was even the guest artist on the PBS Boston Pops tv show. He is an ""Indian"" Brazilian and thus uses a large variety of percussion instruments. Although he uses electronic instruments, his incredible talent with native Brazilian percussion instruments is an fascinating listening experience. I saw him live in Kansas City and while playing a drum set he also simultaniously plys other devices. He is a rhythmic Zwengali."
2,"Insightful, but inclusive","Downing is an excellent writer making postmodern philosophy very accessible. Another plus is she has interacted with the primary sources. Too many evangelicals just read critiques by other evangelicals. Downing has spent some time with postmodern writers. Much of the book was helpful. She shows that postmodernisms exposing of the flaws of modernism has served our faith. This is very true in many ways, but Downing goes too far the other way. She leans toward inclusivism, which is a very tempting thing to do in today's postmodern culture in order to not offend, and remain respectable. The problem is the biblical worldview will not allow it. Christians must build their worldview from Scripture, as unpopluar as this may be. You just can't mix worldviews and remain faithful to both. I would reccomend Veith's 'Postmodern Times' then this one."
2,Proposes a thesis without logical foundation,"After reading this book for a philosophy class, I am strongly of the opinion that Downing has little skill as a writer or logician. Yes, she does establish postmodernism and its roots nicely, but she fails to establish the very thesis of her book--that postmodernism serves faith. While I will admit my bias to disagree with her, she did not successfully make her arguments. I found myself repeatedly wondering how she could fail to see the circular reasoning and illogical leaps. Maybe if she had actually been able to argue her point, I might have thought more highly of this book."
4,Good for a Winter's night,"This is the type of mystery that grabs your attention from the first page and holds your interest until the last! I found it hard to put down, with an extraordinary heroine who commands ones attention! Ms. Duckro knows how to set the scene, in this case Hilton Head and Beaufort, South Carolina, and to tell a tale of intrigue, excitement and concluding suspense which will surprise even the most avid mystery reader. An excellent first effort, with the promise of yet more to come."
5,Christmas Caroll Sweet Valley Style,This book isn't scarry at all.In fact it's really sweet and is about Jessica(my favorite twin).I recall reading this as a kid and am now rekindled reading the Sweet Valley series and was so tickled and thrilled to fine that this book was still in print.If you're a fan of the Christmas Caroll like retelling and am a big of Sweet Valley fan as I am.You will love this book.
5,Xmas Ghost,Replacement book for old HC edition. I am pleased with the condition of the book; I am already planning for the Holidays. Teacher-Librarian
5,Way cool,I think the ghosts taught Jess a good lesson. She should have told Jessica about the little mistake. I was happy when the Ghost brought her into the future and showed her that things would turn around and Elizabeth would be popular and Jessica would not have friends.
4,Christmas For The Wakefileds,"For some reason I just love this book, and did even when I was little. It was one of my favorite Sweet Valley Twin books. Maybe it's because of the 'Christmas Carol' connection, I really don't know. But this is a really sweet retelling of Charles Dickens classic, Sweet Valley style. I still have this mental image in my head of reading this when I got the book during the Winter Holidays many years ago.This book is well-written and has a good message for kids as well."
3,CJ1022,"I ordered two boxes of hanging folders(navy and violet), however, none of them have the interior infopockets and color-matched plastic tabs(only clear tabs inside the boxes) as described in the technical details. I'm wondering if I've received wrong stuffs.I've shopped with Amazon many years and this is the very first time I'm not quite satisfied with my orders. Thank you Amazon!"
3,Would be great if it arrived in the color that was ordered.,"I ordered these folders specifically because I specifically needed 'black' folders. Needless to say, when they arrived and were BRIGHT orange, I was a bit disappointed. I decided to keep the orange to avoid the hassle of a visit to the post office, paying return shipping, and waiting for the CORRECT product to arrive. Perhaps I will just buy a few Sharpie markers to color over the orange.Overall, the product is great -- if it arrives in the correct color."
2,Not 25 in a box...,"These seem sturdy enough, and basic black, but I was inclined to count the contents since other reviewers mentioned getting shorted. They were right! I ordered two boxes, one had 25, but the other 24! What's up with that?"
3,Photo misleading,"These are not true black; they are a deep gray. If you've seen how the green pendaflex folders are mottled color, that's the same effect here. That's disappointing, because the photo makes these look like a deep, maybe even glossy, black.The actual weight of the folder isn't impressive either. How they'll hold up is more a function of the strength of the top fold, so we'll see. If there's anything negative in that aspect, I'll be sure to update this review."
4,A short term review,"As I've only used them for a short time, I can not comment on durability, but I will comment on the initial. It seems like any other hanging folder. Nothing too special about it. Although it is not as Jet black as I imagined it would be. It's more of a dull/cardboard black type color. Not really as pictured. But not bad."
3,as a reference only,"This book was not what I was expecting, but it does seem to be a good reference book for how aircraft components and plans are depicted for ""traditional"" aircraft structures (ie tube&rag). The book is mostly a collection of plan sections showing the details of part layout. Very little ""design"" text, mostly just plan section reprints in *detail* (thus the name). There are also a lot of conversion tables, hardware spec tables and a term dictionary. I'm building a rag&tube plane, so I'll hang on to this as a reference."
5,"Exceptionally warm, friendly, easy listening acoustic music","Chuck Pyle's latest CD captures the essence of his easy going and sincere stage presence with a combination of serious and humorous songs done in an acoustic folk/country style. These are singer-songwriter compositions that you have to really listen to the lyrics to fully appreciate. The productions are not overdone and yet feature some of the best musicians and backup vocals by such noteworthy folks as Jerry Jeff Walker. I heard Chuck live at the Tumbleweed Music Festival in Richland, Washington in September, 1999. Don't miss a chance to see him in person and don't miss this CD, it is a real gem!"
1,Basically useless,"Okay, you know when you go into a dimly lit restaurant where each table has a tea light candle on it which provides just enough light for atmosphere, but not enough to do anything useful, like read the menu? That's the level of illumination we're talking about with this lantern. You can see the light of the lantern, but you can't see by the light of the lantern. It's very pretty though."
3,Good for younger kids,This is good enough for younger children but oler ones and adults won't be happy with it.
1,don't waste your money,This lantern is not bright at all. My Coleman micro lantern is brighter and has only 3 led save your and go with known brand.Coleman MicroPacker Compact Battery Lantern
1,a disaster,The lantern DID NOT WORK!!! The on-off switch was broken! Maybe that is why it was so cheap?
2,Power externally,"The dynamo does not do a great job for this lamp. If you crank for a minute, you will get about 3 minutes of good light and then it fades fast. Perhaps this is normal with dynamo charging, but I expected a longer charge, especially when it is running off low power LEDs."
4,Won't Burn Your Barn Down,"This is a good product that performs well. The hand crank obviously provides sufficient power for an acceptable amount of time. The lantern has 3 settings for brightness: 4 leds, 8 leds, and 12 leds. At 12 leds this lantern provided enough light to compare with a propane lantern except you don't have to deal with the gas, heat, or threat of burning yourself. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because the overall sturdiness seemed a bit flimsy, but it has not broken thus far."
2,Caveat Emptor!,"Bought this lantern to use in Afghanistan to augment the room lighting. Should have thought twice, and I hope others do too. It says to crank the lantern for one minute rapidly; this causes quite the glow for about 30 seconds, which is not what it said in the listing. The handle also has broken; I would not recommend it if you are looking for a decent light output. It just isn't there."
2,poor quality,"As mentioned by another reviewer, I saw these lanterns in a retail discount store. I was very close to purchasing it until after cranking for a minute, the on button wasn't cycling through the light modes. Only the 12 led mode worked. The rubber covered on button is also simply a cover, if you push, and slide by accident the rubber cap slides under the casing. After trying to play around with it in the store, the 4 light came on and flickered, then went out. Unfortunately there wasn't another exact model to test/buy so I opted away from this one."
4,Good Stuff !!!!,"I love these crank up lanterns. They give off enough light, last good when you crank them 120 times as per the directions and are cool. They really give you that camping feeling and I am sure will work great in a power outage."
4,Delightful Introduction into Oracular,"I had the blessed chance to meet Diane Skafte and found her to be such a warm and spiritual woman. She has the air of some ancient prophetess herself; which made her book all the better. The best parts of this book is Skafte's imagining of what an ancient scene would look like (for example--what a petioner to the Oracle might think or experience before, during, and after their oracular experience). She helped me see that God and the ""gods"" speak to us all the time through various means. The only thing keeping me from giving her book the full 5 stars, is it begins to bog down toward the end as she gets muddled in left-wing environmentalism. But overall, a good book."
3,A nice English book,There are a lot of proverbs that Czech families throw out when trying to make a point. I guess my expectation would be to have the Czech proverb first with an English Translation following. There are a few Czech translations in the book but not many. The book is a mainly a list of the English version of popular Czech sayings. It is a very nicely decorated book and I did enjoy looking through it. Didn't want anyone else to be disappointed if you were looking for a one stop shop of Czech sayings in both Czech and English.
3,Not much individuality,"Students are given a cute picture with all the words already written and a blank space for the student to write one or two words. While this book may be great for kindergarten or even preschool, I have found it is not challenging enough for first graders."
4,Great Ideas,This book gives a teacher many great ideas to use in writing books with children. Many of the patterns are very easy to reproduce and are helpful.
1,This could be the most annoying cartoon ever.,"Some kids seem to really like these episodes. I fear for them. But, I fear more for their parents and society. This cartoon features a collection of insipid, annoying children who make you wonder if they're intended to depict human beings or some lower, more grating form of life. And it's not just the kids. The parents and grandparents are unnerving in their own way, in part because you know that they gave birth, directly or indirectly, to these cloying offspring....Anyway, my daughter rented this--and forced me to sit through it to convince me that it had some merit. She was wrong. ..."
1,no more overpriced little bits of shows!,Where are the seasonal sets of this fine show. They're doing the seasonal sets of Spongebob for crying out loud.
5,Granddaughter loves it!,My Granddaughter just recently discovered the Rugrats through Netflix which she doesn't have at home so I got her this DVD to take home with her. She watches it over and over!
5,Technical Perfection of a Master's Piece is Bliss,"The previous rater's comment about this being without soul, I think, is not fair. For me, the perfection of most anything by this organization creates a blissful passion not to be outdone - it depends on what you're looking for. My purpose is the recreation of the Master's work, and I happen to be entranced by this orchestra, therefore, listening to this work, especially turned up loud, will bring me tears.As recommended, I will check out Mackerras, but I'm positive that this recording does not deserve two stars!"
2,I must disagree,"I can't think of a larger tragedy in the world of classical music than Marriner's control of the Academy of St.-Martin-in-the-Fields. SMitF is one of the finer orchestras around, and yet Marriner is one of the most uninspired and flat conductors to reach his level of popularity. Mozart's 40th comes off as a souless, but technically mostly correct rendition, and the 41st (Jupier) makes this masterpiece sound far less than masterful--in places, dissonant. The best Mozart I've yet to hear is under the baton of Mackerras--do your self a favor and persue his recordings; leave Marriner on the shelf."
2,The chapters are too short.,"While his ideas are good, each is only given a page or two of explanation. I felt like I was reading the Cliff Notes edition."
2,No No No! Great concept poor performer,"If you check around this is a discontinued item.I bought three on clearance for cheap on the web, I paid $12ea. Just arrived yesterday. I think it is a great idea. But the amount of air bubbles was not near enough for my needs. The deeper the water the worse it will get even with the regulator removed for MAX air. ARIO 4 clams to go as deep as 14"", But the siphoning technic will suffer at this depth. I am also so curious about the heat it will generated, which could be a plus for tropical fish i guess if it doesn't over heat like a waterfall-pump when its not cleaned regularly. I found it difficult to hide and hold down and very noisy if touching surfaces as the other review mentioned. I would not buy these again. Will stick to a good old pump and stones."
1,Works great at first....,"The aerator works wonders at first - before it completely dies. I had it plugged in for a total of 10 hours before it completely died on me. When it was working, it was exactly what I needed so I am very disappointed. There were LOTS of bubbles!!Maybe it was just a lemon, but who knows..."
2,Lasted a little while.,"It's a cute little kettle, but didn't last long. The handle came loose from the spout after overheating it. I DID forget it was on, but was close enough that, if it whistled loud enough, I'd have heard it .... and yes, I did have the spout lid down in in place. Also, there is a problem with the roll pin that acts as a clevis, or hinge, for the spout lid. After 30 or 40 uses it starts to work it's way out. It was almost completely out when I caught it. It presses back in easily, but be careful to not let it end up in your tea cup. The whistle volume varies a lot relative to the amount of water you're boiling. A small amount of water, for one or two cups say, won't whistle loud enough to hear it over the TV. BTW, I DO have good hearing."
1,Worse teakettle ever!,"In need of a new kettle I came across this Copco. 1st thing I noticed was the lid was hard to take off and on and now I just finished trying it out for the 1st time. What a mess! it sprays water all over the place as soon as it starts boiling and when I went to pour it, water came out from like 3 different places. I am returning it today!"
1,Generally Useless and a Waste of Money,"I have both this Chiltons Fiero manual and Haynes Fiero manual. I have reviewed both at the Haynes Fiero manual page, and as both are nearly the same in content, both fall way short of any use other than very basic information. See that review for details:Pontiac Fiero '84'88 (Haynes Manuals)"
5,"Great for the do-it-yourself types, like me!","This book was just what I was looking for. It breaks down the technical aspects of ski tuning and preparation into the basics for everyone from the novice to the experienced ski enthusiast. Prepared me for the task of purchasing used skis and accessories and for tuning and adjusting everything for every member of my family. Saved me a bundle and allowed me the satisfaction that everything is done right to get us on the slopes and keep us there as long as we want without being at the mercy of the Pro Shop and expensive ski equipment rentals. After spending a few bucks on some minor equipment for tuning, I purchased the skis and accessories and had everyone tuned and ready to go for not much more than it would have cost me to rent everything. All future trips are a bonus..."
5,Great Sound in a Small Package,"I just bought this system for my mother. She wanted something small that sounded good and could hold 3 CD's. This system also has 2 cassette decks. There are 3 programmed EQ settings from which to choose depending on the style of music you listen to. The display is colorful with lots of moving bar graphs and other information. The unit is very nice-looking and has a high-quality, sturdy feel to it. The real beauty of the system is it's dual-powered subwoofers. Each one get's a dedicated 35 watts leaving a more-than-ample 15 watts per channel for the mid-high range drivers for a sytem total of 100 watts. It sounds great at moderate levels with very clean, deep bass and only suffers at very high levels from distortion due to extreme woofer excursions. It even has outputs for surround speakers. For the size, price, and features of the system it's pretty hard to beat!"
5,Great Show with Great Plots,"This is a GREAT SHOW with GREAT PLOTS that are interesting and well written for an animated series that was done 15 YEARS ago. The picture quality and sound are pretty good they are not perfect but pretty good. The Menus are nicely done, overall this is a very nice set , you really can't beat it for the PRICE. The show itself is done very well with GREAT PLOTS and ADVENTURES, King Arthur, Merlin, Valiant, Arn and Rowanne are all great characters. Once you start watching you wont be able to stop, this show has you addicted from the very start. I was very pleased with this set, they also put a nice booklet in the set that lists every episode with a brief description and picture of each episode, again nicely done. This set is a must buy and I am looking forward for the 2nd volume to complete this GREAT SERIES!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Comic strip to cartoon,"This four disc cartoon set has been vividly and brilliantly been adapted from the long running Sunday morning newspaper comic strip. It is a bit slow, but worth the watch. It's all about a fallen prince chasing a dream. Literally chasing a dream he had one night on his exiled island.It's a bit goofy,but still well done.It's great to have on a sleepless night. It is almost guarnatee to put you to sleep. Vivid color."
1,First Impression of Cantu's Delphi 6,"I bought this book to learn Delphi. I have no prior experience in it. I am not even 4 pages into the book, and the author is already telling me that he is not going into any details on the basics of Delphi, but instead, is going to focus on enhancements concerning Version 6. He already assumes I am familiar with the Delphi IDE, and if I am not, I can go to his website and get the information I need. I went to his website, and it is more confusing than the book (needless to say, I cant find his ""step by step instructions on Delphi IDE). I think this guy needs to jump off of ""cloud 9"", and step back down into the real world. I want to learn Delphi, not write a thesis on it, or go off on some intellectual space fantasy into the cosmos. I just want to learn Delphi! This book has over 1000 pages, and already assumes you know Delphi!"
3,Cantu is overrated,"I've read Mastering Delphi 3 and 6 and while Marco Cantu does a good job of exposing Delphi to beginners, his style is VERY lacking when it comes to advanced techniques. I also feel he is somewhat condescending in his explanation of technical matters and assumes that his reader is a near-complete neophyte (well that could also explain the popularity of his books). Still, the website complementing his books does show an effort to make it useful and attractive to his audience.Fairly experienced programmer will find that his writing style in the Mastering Delphi series hobbles learning as in the effort to sound more 'friendly' by not adopting deeper technical terms he takes two paragraphs to explain something which a couple of sentences should suffice to."
1,Send this book back to the 50s,"This book is without a doubt the most disappointing online buy I have ever made as the story is devoid of entertainment value, and serves only to reinforce gender stereotypes. It comes across as smarmy, reactionary, and astonishingly clichéd.The drawings are artfully done in a sort of pastelled version of Norman Rockwell fused with Illustrated Bible. As a 21st century dad I felt insulted reading this and can only recommend any existing owners to send this book straight back to the 1950s where it belongs."
5,Wonderful Book for Daddys and Babies,"Daddy's Lullaby is a wonderful story about a Daddy who comes home from work late one night- and finds his whole family asleep - all except his youngest baby. So, Daddy and Baby take a stroll around the house, checking on all sleeping family members. Then they settle down and Daddy sings Baby a lullaby (to the tune of Rock-a-by Baby).The illustrations are beautiful and the story is really sweet.This is a wonderful gift for expectant and/or new dads. I've bought several copies to give as gifts this holiday."
5,Should be issued equipment for all GI's in Korea.,"I bought this book in a bar on Aragon Alley in Songtan, Korea outside Osan Air Base in 2001. It was my second tour at Osan and between the tours, the Korean ""Juicy Girls"" had been replaced by Russian and Filipina bar girls. This book will give you all the clues on how to score with Bar Girls without losing all your money and it will teach you all the scams they play. All young (and old GI's) should be issued this book. Too bad it is now out of print. If you come across it somewhere, BUY IT!!"
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"""Lone Star Knight"" is the 5th installment in the Texas Cattlemen Club Series. This is the first book I read by Sara Orwig and I guarantee it won't be the last.In this installment, the reader is introduced to two lonely characters, Matt and Helena. Matt is a member of the Texas Cattlemen Club, which is a front for a secret organization. Helena is a member of a royal family who was in a plane crash which the TCC is investigating. Matt moves Helena to his ranch so he can protect her better. During her period of recuperation, Matt and Helena get to know each other better and end up getting CLOSE.That's about all I can say without giving up the story. I can say this book is great and is an excellent addition to the series. If you want a book that captures your attention, moves quickly, and mixed with a little suspense, then this is the book for you.Let me know if you enjoy it. Don't forget to read the entire series."
2,The Don't Sweat Affirmations: 100 Inspirations to Help Make Your Life Happier and More Relaxed,"Some of the affirmations are good. Others are just fair. Not what I was looking for, only has affirmations for feelings and not for parts of the human body and nerves, ect."
5,not just for nurses,"This book approaches nurses' writing from a new angle. Not only are the nurses' poems presented, but alongside each poem is a commentary on the circumstances of the writing of the poem: in other words, the poetic process behind the finished product. It's a mistake to label these writers ""nurse-poets,"" suggesting that they are somehow separate from ""poets."" They are poets who are also working as nurses, just as there are poets who are working as butchers and teachers and undertakers and housewives. The poets' commentaries in this collection reveal hints and information about the process of writing that will be valuable to all writers, not only those who happen to be nurses. Some readers may fear that ""nurses' poetry"" might be either too sweet or too grim. But this is a collection of human poetry, good poetry, poetry that stays in the mind and the heart."
3,A Younger Perspective on Apartheid,"After reading several books by J.M. Coetzee, I was more or less prepared for the conditions and incidents portrayed by Mr. Eprile. However, the experience here is that of a person maturing in the closing years of apartheid, rather than the older characters in Mr. Coetzee's works. The result is a view into the vulnerability of a young person trying to adapt to a collapsing racist society, the lack of alternatives for living a morally fulfilling life. Perhaps it's this lack of structure in the experience that leads to a shortage of structure in the novel. While some of the parts are intensely interesting, and all are worth reading, most can be read without reference to the others. The lead character's gift of memory is a unifying factor, but really not vital to most of the events. The writing is outstanding, though it might benefit from cutting, and the work is entertaining despite the grim subject at its center."
3,Epile's South African Tale,"Great historical depiction of the Apartide in South Africa. Beautifully written; it reads as a historical memoir. Plot not that engaging. Very interesting protagonist point of view. By the end of the book, the question of 'accurate' memory lingers."
5,"Review of ""The Crocheter's Treasure Chest""","""The Crocheter's Treasure Chest"" is an excellent, comprehensive book for anyone that loves to crochet or wants to learn. It has easy to follow directions and explains as well as illustrates how to make the stictches.The book has a variety of patterns from doilies to large tablecloths to bedspreads. For those who want to tackle larger projects, you can make sets such as placemats and table runners with matching coasters.There are also examples of how to combine crocheting with fabric for tablecloths and doiles. There are a variety of edgings which can be adapted to any fabric.Overall, this book meets the needs of the beginning as well as the experienced crocheter. Happy Crocheting!"
3,Begin with another book,"Although the patterns in this book are beautiful, you should work with another book if you're a beginner. These patterns were written by/for thread companies that have long been out of business. The gage is very difficult to get correct on some of these and it took some research on thread to needle equivalents and a number of restarts to get going on a doily that would lay flat."
1,The Crocheter's Treasure Chest,Wasn't particularly impressed with this book. Some of the patterns are difficult to understand and the print is so small it is difficult to read
5,A fine book,"The patterns in this book are absolutely beautiful, they are worked on bedspread weight. They are very traditional and I like that."
4,A Good Read!,"Don't be put off by this book's daunting terminology. Beneath the author's unrestrained use of labels like universalism, particularism, individualism, communitarianism, specificity and diffuseness, lies an insightful analysis of cultural differences. After defining various nationalities under a host of polysyllabic headings, authors Charles M. Hampden-Turner and Fons Trompenaars illustrate the differences between them using engaging and easy-to-understand scenarios and stories from popular culture. The end goal of each of these sections is to explain to international business managers how cultural dilemmas can be reconciled."
4,Great Book,"This was a great book about the early history of the Texas Rangers, and life on the frontier pre-Civil War and after. The characters were wonderful and narrative to keep you on your seat."
4,A Candid Perspective of In the Fishbowl of Ministry Life,"Nancy's book is a recollection weaved with stories and some preaching in between. There were many subjects I could relate to, from individuality, to living with a human that is seen by infinite by some and a scapegoat by others, children in a fishbowl, callings in ministry for pastor's wives, realities of congregations, marriage issues because of ministerial schedules and other important topics. I appreciated her vulnerability, her insights and her honest evaluations. I think I will share it with other pastor's wives as I am sure they will see themselves in this book as well. Although she is showing reality, she does it with a candid optimism. It was a fun read and gave me some great things to think about from a new perspective."
4,Very encouraging and uplifting volume for ministers' wives,"This book helped me find peace in the first (eventful!) year of being a staff wife. By sharing humorous anecdotes from her career as a ministry wife, Pannell encourages other women who are married to church staff members to be the person God created them to be. Her chapters on dealing with difficult people and relishing the ""fun parts"" of ministry life kept me smiling, and her honesty about the hard parts of staff life made me realize I was not alone. If you're struggling with your place as a minister's wife, read this book!"
3,Good but no cigar,"I'll make this short.Did anyone expect Farewell Summer to be as good as Dandelion Wine? I didn't. So I was less ""shocked"" at its quality than some.It is by no means a bad book, but it is also by no means as good as Dandelion is.You won't gasp in awe at this, but nor will you need to get drunk afterwards, to flush the bad taste of it out of your system.It is good. Just no cigar.And I DID enjoy the ""talking to one's genitals"" part of the story. That was kinda inspired."
2,Douglas Who?,"Dandelion Wine has been in my personal top 3 ever since I first read it for a sophomore lit course in 1982. Although the afterword of Farewell to Summer asserts that both novels were born of one draft, the original characters are recognizable only in brief flickers. Douglas Spaulding, in particular, in a matter of supposed mere days or weeks between the end of the first novel and the beginning of the next, has inexplicably morphed from the pensive, sensitive everyboy into the wannabe leader of a small-town terrorist cell. Yes, Bradbury remains ever the wordsmith, but this was just a bummer - too dark and too bizarre in comparison to the original. I almost wish I hadn't read it at all."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a big fan of Dandelion Wine, but found Farewell Summer to be disappointing at best. The Douglas of Farewell Summer bears little resemblance to the boy we knew in the book's prequel; he comes off as little more than a hoodlum in this story. Further, I thought the chapter dealing with his sexual awakening was weird. I think Bradbury has lost it, but then maybe all men lay awake at night talking to that thing down there.Farewell Summer lacks the depth and emotion of Dandelion Wine. Check it out for the library if you are curious, but don't waste your money."
3,An Interesting Diversion,"Compared to Dandelion Wine, this book does not hold up well. But maybe it's not fair to make such a comparison. If you're reading this, then you're probably familiar with the back-story, so I won't repeat it, but the upshot is if you like Dandelion Wine, this book continues the story, but it is almost nothing like Dandelion Wine in that it has a linear narrative that focuses entirely on Doug as opposed to the episodic stories in DW. Ultimately, I like to pretend that this book is a sequel to some other book, and if you're looking for a Green Town fix, then just reread DW and Something Wicked This Way Comes, both of which are superior.Also, much has been said about the sexual awakening that occurs in Farewell Summer. Perhaps too much. It's weird, but it's Bradbury. If you've made it this far, you'll do fine."
3,"MM, Bradbury",Not my favorite Bradbury but still chock full of delightful images and words. Supposedly a 'sequel' to Dandelion Wine; I didn't really feel the connection.
4,Book most enjoyable when read in August...,"It's funny, I read Dandelion Wine in June/July... Then in the scorcher of August 09'(currently) I finished with Farewell Summer, and the ending, I finished reading laying down on a couch around 3 in the morning. It was decent sychronicity that enhanced the book. I figure, you could walk away from Dandelion feeling sated but farewell summer is close to a mandatory read to get somewhat of a better conclusion, the conclusion of which definitely surprised me."
4,Gorgeousness counts for a lot in these two luscious works,"Most older listeners leave behind light classics like Scheherazade and the Fountains of Rome at a certain point. I retain a lingering fondness for the former, though, and in the annals of great Scheherazade recordings, Stokowski produced a handufl. This must be the most gorgeous to come out of Philadelphia since his heyday, and gorgeousness counts for a lot.Muti doesn't lay on the Arabian Nights shmaltz at all--his tempos tend to be brisk, his phrasing pristine rather than blatant. But there's panache, and EMI's recorded sound, if a bit distant, packs a punch. If Scheherazade is one of your guilty pleasures, this is a luscious wallow. The Resphigi, also gorgeously played, gets a marvellously pure and un-vulgar reading."
2,Poor Quality - Not as Advertised,I did not like this product because the sound quality in 8 out of 10 waltzes was poorly recorded in ADD. It had been advertised as being fully DDD.
1,i have my doubts,the dvd is still inside the package. i still have not opened it in fear that if i open it and its damaged i wont get my refund.i want to know if i can return to get my refund
2,Disappointing for people with a larger interest,"At first glance this book looks OK but when I read this book it can't live up to my expectations as a world war 2 enthousiast. The information on this book is not correct either because it has only 160 pages instead of 272 pages. Some of the pictures inside this book are good because I haven't seen them before in other books. The book is OK for people who take a look at world war 2 for the first time, people who want to know what weapons decided the outcome of battles and the war as a whole. But it is not interesting for people who have a larger interest."
4,Might rain.,"A clever mixing of fact and fiction. Teddy Kennedy sweats in the Senate Steam Room...Barbara Boxer grandstands on the Senate floor...Trent Lott parks his damn car over the white line in the Senate parking lot. Lefcourt has fun skewering the usual cast of Senate characters while inventing the totally believable Woodrow W. White - junior Senator from the great state of Vermont - and a dizzying cast of two staffs, two wives, two children, two INS proceedings, and an unused supply of Testoderm. Perfect for a plane ride."
5,Hysterical!!,"I read the Booklist review of this book and had to get a copy. I'm not finished yet, but so far, I'm loving every minute of this book. Sometimes I'm laughing so hard that I have to stop to catch my breath. What I'm enjoying the most is the fact that he is using real people in his story. The Trent Lott story line is a killer. Also, I absolutely thought that Lefcourt was ingenious in choosing names for the men of Vermont's organized crime. Hysterical! It was nice to know that I wasn't completely historically challenged when I figured that part out before it was explained in the book. This is my first book by this author, but it won't be my last."
3,Fun,"A fun read. Lefcourt has a great sense of the absurd without taking it overboard. In lesser hands, this tale would have devlolved into irrelevance. That said, the author seems to be of two minds as to whether Woody White has a redemptive internal character. If he does, some of the early events in the book seem incongruous. If he doesn't, some of his later actions seem far-fetched. It feels like Lefcourt began the book wanting White to be a buffoon, but began to like him along the way. The result is that the author suddenly ascribes his central figure certain redeeming traits without laying the groundwork necessary for the reader to believe in them."
2,Blecky!,"I should have known with a book titled Woody, and reading the cover should have been a clue, but I happened to be in the bookstore, choosing books with red, white and blue on the spine (I like political satire), and I happened upon this one. It had potential, so I did read it all, if that is saying anything. All the way to the last chapter where a character invoked his First [sic] Amendment right not to testify against himself. A good editor (or even a semi-competent one) would have caught this mistake. Other comments: It's rude and absurd, definitely not funny."
5,please give us a table of contents,How can you expect us to buy the book without providing a table of contents?!
3,Pill-Doh Chicken Flavor,The Chicken flavored doh is not that big of a hit. A few of my cat's will eat the Tuna Flavored much quicker.
2,Grammatical Errors,"Someone should have proofread this book before it went to the printer. I find it difficult to concentrate on the text, when I am finding so many gramatical errors. I am trying to focus on content, but so many errors are distracting."
5,As Advertised,"When our Hoover vacumn bag was full my wife thought we may be able to empty and reuse since they were less dusty than paper ones we had used in the past. Knowing they were not reusable I found these Hepa Y filter bags on Amazon for a reasonable price. In the meantime had to get paper bags. The paper are not near as good as these cloth filter bags. The only problem was the shipping cost was as much as the bags. Price, shipping time and product were all as advertised. Will buy again. I combined with other items so ended up with no shipping cost. Recommend stocking up when placing other orders on Amazon."
4,"Plenty expensive, but they work well.","These bags are expensive, but seem to capture way more dust than cheaper varieties. After reading many of the reviews, it's apparent that some people have no clue how a vacuum bag works. Several people commented that although only half-full, the bag needs changing. It's important to note that the volume of dirt inside a vacuum bag has little to do with whether or not it needs changing. Rather, the amount of fine dust that's clogging the bag material itself is the deciding factor. You could install a brand new bag in your machine, then proceed to vacuum up a relatively small about of fine power, and pretty much destroy the bag. The incoming air would not be able to pass thru the bag material, since it's clogged with the fine powder. So don't be upset that your bags need changing when they aren't completely full. Full has nothing to do with it."
1,Don't buy these bags!,The bags I ordered were Hoover bags as shown in the picture. I ordered 4 packages of 2 each and I received 4 non-hoover bags that were the wrong size. If you want the real bags that fit don't order these.
4,Hoover Type Y HEPA Filter Bag is excellent,The OEM type Y bag and the generic replacement bags let a little too much dust through. This bag is good but a little pricey.Thanks.
5,Good filter,Very happy with the filter - definitely holds the dust and dirt inside. Haven't had any issues with allergies since...
1,Do not buy from B&M Housewares.,"Please note that this product is sold through several different sellers. If bought from B&M Housewares, be aware that what you will receive is not Hoover brand bags, but a knock-off, sent without packaging in a plastic envelope. The product description clearly reads Hoover Bags, and are priced as such, but the product I received is inferior, and not worth what I paid."
1,Product was not what is described. Stay away from B & M Housewares.,"I just received the vacuum bags from B & M Housewares. I ordered two packs of HEPA Filter Bags, two per bag. What I received were two packs of normal non HEPA bags, three per pack. This seller is not reliable and ripped me off. I recommend using a different vendor. It is not worth it for me to ship the bags that I received back. What is extra annoying is on the same day I purchased normal bags from a different vendor via Amazon.com, the 9 pack, for $7.00. So now I have 15 normal vacuum bags and no HEPA filtered bags. And these 6 normal bags cost $19.80 :(I can not rate the bags since I did not receive them. The one * is for the vendor."
1,Buyer beware,FALSE INFORMATION. Did not receive 3M Filtrete HEPA Bags as shown in picture or as mention.
3,make sure the bag fits into your vacume before purchase,"i think this bag capacity is too big for this particular machine even though it was ""recommended"" by amazon when i purchased the hoover vacuum. i had to hold in the extra before closing the door. i just replaced the bag for this one...so i'll see how it'll perform."
5,Quality bags,These bags are very thick and do an excellent job of filtering out all dust. There is never any dust showing inside the vacuum or on the secondary filter.
1,not what I paid for,"When I saw this item I thought 'WOW! How perfect, the kids will love this'. Got it in the mail and thought 'hmmm. . . a little chintzy, but still awesome for the kids'. An hour into playing with the 2 kits I bought they had disassembled every piece except the maybe 2 items that are solid plastic. WHO in their right mind makes a children's toy to disassemble into SO MANY PIECES!!! I definitely expected better quality than what we received and would have sent both bags back if it werent for the fact that now all the pieces are strewn about the house."
4,bag,My nephew and niece are not that into it yet but I'm hoping they will be soon. It's a pain [...] to get the thing to close with all the buttons. Also the plastic thing in the middle has been destroyed in the case. But all the toys stay together just fine except for the blood pressure toy. The tube pops off really easily and it's annoying to keep putting it back together and kids don't have patience for that kind of stuff.
3,not very durable,"I got this for my daughter when she was 18 months old to ease her fears of doctor visits. It didn't really do that but it is one of her favorite toys. However, 6 months later the blood pressure cuff no longer stays together and the snap is about to come off, the stethoscope has come apart in two places and the case itself has ripped in several spots. I think the pieces could be more realistic as well. I'm looking for a replacement because all the pieces are in such bad shape now (or lost) but this was definitely a hit while it lasted."
2,pretty junky,"This doctors kit looks really cute. My 2 year old loved it the minute she saw it. It also started falling apart the minute she saw it. The blood pressure toy broke, the snap fell off one end, after the first day. Now, about 2 weeks later the bag is actually tearing in a few places. For the same price, the Fisher Price one is a much better deal. I will be buying that one soon."
2,Very Disappointed - missing pieces,"This product arrived and had missing pieces and other duplicate pieces. I was so disappointed and would have returned this item had my grandson not already opened and started to play with it. I've always had great success with ordering with Amazon, but this will make me watch the items a little closer."
4,A great gift,Love it! It arrived quickly. Perfect gift for friend who is interesed in medical stuff. I would buy it again. Madel me think of the old fashion toys I grew up with.
2,Spend the extra money,"Do yourself a favor and keep looking. I got this toy for my toddler, who enjoyed for all of the few days it lasted. Very poor quality and cheaply made. I suppose it would be cute as a prop for a Halloween costume or something. But don't expect it last through a good play session of even the most gentle child. Spend the extra bucks and buy a better set."
4,Teaching Kids to Stay Healthy,This doctor bag is a realistic way to teach kids to stay healthy with doing the simple things from washing hands to listening to their heart.The bag is also a good idea to use as a prop for demonstration for adults especially during this flu pandemic.
1,child's doctor kit,I purchased this for my 31/2 yr old granddaughter. The quality was very poor and the snaps pulled out before Christmas day was over and the doctor tools were very poorly made. I was not pleased with this product at all.
1,Definitely NOT worth the cost - VERY 'cheap' toy,"I was excited to get this for my 3 yr old son, because he's not yet had a doctor kit, but was so disappointed when it came - it is the cheapest most horribly made kit. The kit pieces are made of the THINNEST plastic, if they get squeezed at all, they just stay crushed, the thermometer and medicine syringe seem like they're supposed to 'function' (minimally at least) but they don't, and the blood pressure cuff is made of cheap felt. I want to return it but it'll cost me almost half the price of the stupid kit to send it back, so I guess my son will just get to play with it til it's destroyed and I'll have wasted the money. I didn't have a lot of money to spend on a kit, and was excited I found one that was relatively inexpensive, but I apparently should have checked the previous reviews more closely. Because now I've just completely wasted my money on a piece of cr*p toy. :("
2,You get what you pay for,"This is a cute toy but really cheaply made. My daughter is 2 and she loves playing doctor, especially at the doctors office but after just a few playtimes the bag has ripped, the blood pressure cuff which is made of felt has ripped, etc. This is not durable for long-term use."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas and it fell apart the next day. The pieces were flimsy and the bag itself came apart after hardly any play at all.
1,Junk,"We have had it for about 2 months. The hard plastic tools are good. They appear to be able to withstand some use. However, the bag can be literally ripped in half by a one year old's hands. The blood pressure cuff is made of felt. The snap is going to pull off soon. The stethascope is falling apart. The thermometer fell apart into 3 pieces. Complete Junk. I guess you get what you pay for..."
3,3 year old likes it,"It does the trick for what type of play I hoped my son would get out of it. However, I felt the bag that contains the items was a bit cheap. It should be more durable for young children."
3,Potential,"Starts out unevenly, middle section very moving, ending predictable. Rayner is just filling time for Jordan. It's alright."
1,The Item I didn't get:,"In March of this year, I ordered a 2 oz tube of MAAS Metal Polishing Creme. On March 20th I received from our local post office an envelope marked ""received unsealed"". Inside the package was a carton in which the metal polish should have been in, but there was NO TUBE OF POLISHING CREME. Assuming that the tube had fallen out, I wrote to the company and received NO REPLY! I now feel that the whole thing was a scam. I would not order from this company and would like my money back. Sincerely MEMorrison"
4,Sink and Range Hood,"This is an addendum to my prior review. The range hood I polished was enamel, not metal. As I said, it now seems to repel grease. Although it took some elbow ""grease"" and a fair amount of MAAS to clean it, it has been almost a year and all I have had to do is wipe it with a wet cloth to keep it clean."
5,breathalyzers,I buy this for all my relatives and friends as well as recommend this to them for peace of mind both for themselves and their children. This product is priceless!! Thank yu.
2,Awsome subjective test,"LOL let me get this streight, the product detects alcohol by displaying a ""bluish cast"", thats bloody brilliant, so the device will certainly almost always be predisposed to warn of DWI and thus saving lives always. Note the instructions state to never use on oneself due to the subjective indicator I AM or AM NOT drunk.I think there is a lawsuit waiting to happen here... what about color blind people??? Oh dear..."
4,review of Psychiatric Medication Issues for Social Workers . . .,I received this book in the condition the seller said it would be in. I have no complaints about the book or the seller. I rate this seller as very good.
5,A Lyrical Exploration,"This lyrical exploration of butterflies has an amazing range. The author's depth and breadth of research is equaled by her ability to sweep us into a very special world, the world of those who are obsessed with butterflies. Butterfly biology and ecology, the focus of this book, are clearly presented in beautiful language. The details of butterfly anatomy and behavior are sometimes bizarre and always interesting.The author adds depth to the book by including the human view of butterflies. Her profiles of contemporary and historical scientists and ordinary people who have been obsessed with butterflies are riveting. (Some of the people are as peculiar as the insects!) She includes the incredible variety of meanings that societies have assigned to butterflies and moths. I had a hard time putting down this unusual blend of science, biography and mythology."
5,Information to meditate on...,"Looking for a field guide to butterflies and not finding one at my local library, I picked up this little book instead. Not having any expectations, except that maybe this book would be over my head as I do not consider myself 'obsessed', I loved this book...it was enchanting! The awe inspiring nature of these beings is honored here. I found Ms. Russell's writing beautiful and informative, and at just the right times, poetic and inspirational - pausing to quote parts in my journal. I'm not sure that I'm obsessed, but I do find myself seeing many more butterflies, and thinking about them even when they are out of my sight!"
5,Great book for beginners,"I paint with oil pastel but recently decided to use oils and brushes. This book covers everything a painter needs from choice of brushes to loading paint on a brush and the strokes. It includes a good section on cleanup and care of brushes. If you are just starting, I recommend this book."
3,Okay,"Okay, read about brushes and brush work. I would have liked more on different uses of synethic and natural bristles."
2,You will prefer ordering the 2000 edition of the same book,"Because France does not change that much, Michelin Green Guides (1995 edition) did not change either. They still keep this handy pocket format that all other publishers copied. They still are very shy with pictures. They don't tell you everything you would expect from a french guide-book. Still, they tell you what is most important. You cannot make any mistake if you follow their advice. So bring this guide-book with you ... and buy the Knopf or Eyewitness guide to get a more detailed view of our nice region. If you want to get advice from famous Michelin staff about restaurants and places to stay, buy the 2000 edition of this book. If you are interested in more than just castles, read the ""Wine and food guide to the Loire"" from Jacqueline Friedrich and bring back home some bottles of Champigny wine."
1,I DON'T LIKE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,....This book really {stinks}...........it is very bad........no good.....don't waste ur money on it!!!!!!!!! REALLY MAKES WANNA CRY!!!!!!!!
5,No regrets,"I bought an F150 in April, but I did not get the factory instated back-up sensors or camera. It took only a few hours after drove off the lot before I was full of regret about not spending the extra $$ for the camera and sensors. I looked long and hard and discovered this device. I don't tow things regularly, so the trailer hitch was unused space 95% of the time. This sensor is as accurate as my other 2008 Ford with factory sensors. This is the single best purchase I made next to gas and oil. Buy it"
1,Both stories need a little 'birth control',"Whom Gods Destroy is another visit to an insane asylum, no better that the 1st season show 'Dagger Of The Mind'. At least Dagger introduced the 'Vulcan Mind-Meld"". Even the actors looked either 'nut's' or heavily medicated. Note Kirk & Spock slouching in the ""table room"" scene with more than mild disinterest in their faces (even for a Vulcan!)The Mark Of Gideon screams for an obvious message. Duh! Birth Control. Anyway, why would a supposedly intelligent race free of disease allow its' population to run amok! Do I see Soylent Green?"
2,Basic Web Information,"The ""Grantwriter's Internet Companion"" is a short compendium of online sources for grant money. The book is targeted mostly toward primary educators, and (despite the title) others will probably find it of limited use. I'm in psychology higher education, although I did find a few useful tips. Primarily, however, the book serves as a basic primer for seeking internet information. The first chapter talks about websites and search engines (oddly, it does not include google). Subsequent chapters discuss in more detail some education-specific sites. In reading this book, I was hoping to find some new and ""secret"" information imparted; instead, it directs the user to fairly well-known sites.If you haven't used the web much, then this book will probably be somewhat useful (I'd bump it up a star for these users). However, persons who are already web-savvy will likely find little new information here."
5,Excellent instrumental rock!,"An excellent instrumental rock cd. I took lessons from Curt and know that he is one of the few guitar players that also knows music theory very well which shows in his unique and excellent playing. ""Terrise"" is probably my favorite."
5,!!!,"I love Stasia's music! The unforgettable songs explore a wide spectrum of life's experiences with wisdom, sensibility, humor, and grace."
2,I'm not wowed,"This bag is small (for a diaper bag) and cheaply made. It is basically an open bag without pockets or anything to help you organize (except the tiny plastic bag shown in the picture). Did I mention it's cheaply made? I have other diaper bags purchased from Amazon that are fantastic, but this one is not a bargain at 70 percent off the retail price. I would send it back, except the shipping cost to return it is 3/4 the price of the bag itself."
1,Waste of money,"I just bought this game and this book. I am not and avid gamer, but I heard good things about this one so I tried it. This book was supposed to teach me how to win. It tells you absolutely nothing useful.Don't waste your money."
1,Do not Buy this!!!,"My Dad got me Empire Earth gold,when I noteced this in it, So, I read it, and when I was playing Empire Earth Gold, I did what it Said in the walkthroughs,and I lost!!! I treid it with almost all the Campaigns, and I still lost!!!If you want better walkthroughs, go to https://ee.heavengames.com ."
5,Excellent information and VERY EASY TO READ,"THANKS FOR THE GREAT BOOK! I read it in one night and will start to do some of the easy ways to prevent osteoporosis now. I'm only 25, so I want to protect the bones I have. Great read and super information."
5,AMAZING! SUPERB!,"Of all the books out, this book tells it like it is--and gives amazing hope for those with osteoporosis. It tells WHO is at risk, HOW osteoporosis destroys our bones, and HOW to resolve it--easily using FOODS, EXERCISE, LIFESTYLE CHANGES, and MEDICATIONS, if needed. Glad to have the book--hope it saves many lives. Read this--if no other--for it is easy to understand, interesting, and HELPFUL--outlining a complete program for keeping bones strong all your life. Loved it!"
1,Get Another Book about Osteoporosis,"This small book really does not pack a lot of punch unfortunately. Not terribly well written (lots of medicalese) and without particularly clear guidelines in terms of supplementation and exercise, the authors limit themselves to generalities that I cannot imagine would be very helpful. Better to purchase the Nelson book."
5,A formula that works!,Mark's Joyers The Great Formula is an easy to read and follow marketing book that I continue to recommend to my business building clients. Having an effective marketing funnel and a formula in which to use it offers predictable results.Debora McLaughlinMarketing Mastery and Business Building Coach[...]
4,The Great Formula,"Although I haven't finished it yet, I found the book so intriguing and easy to comprehend that I bought ""The Irresistible Offer"" and read that first!"
3,Online marketing,"I was involved with online marketing for ten years, but am no longer involved with it. Not a simple read."
2,Not developed enough,The book surprised me negatively. I expected something more developed not just basic outline of marketing process and some case studies (some of which are totally missing the point). Nothing useful for someone experienced in marketing.
5,More marketing genius from the master,"I gave Mark's prior book, The Irresistible Offer, 5 stars, and The Great Formula deserves at least that many, if not more.This book is so practical in it's explanation of Mark's brilliant - but deceptively simple! - ideas on marketing. It includes several case studies written by contributors who have very successfully used Mark's concepts, and they also include many brilliant ideas of their own. I don't think I've ever dog-eared so many pages in a book before! (And - this is a true story - my girlfriend was wondering why I keep a separate copy in every bathroom in the house!)I highly recommend this book, not just to marketers per se, but to ANYONE who must market or sell anything, be it a product, a concept, or themselves. That applies to salespeople, politicians, singles, teachers, you name it. If you have something to sell, this book will increase your results big-time."
5,Value Packed! Another great One From Mark Joyner,"You can learn exactly what makes the Great Formula within the first few pages of the book. It's a simple concept and once you read it--you see that it's basic common sense.What's great about the book is that it is jam packed with advice from numerous business successes and how they applied the Great Formula to their businesses. You get to hear from people like Yanik Silver, Jason mangrum, Joshua Shafran, and best of all, Lee Benson.Most, if not all, of the guest contibutors com from making big money on the Internet. If you have an Internet based business that sells products (and I guess services, to a point), you should really get your hand on this book! In fact, I'd reccomend you buy this with the Irresistable Offer and you'll probably never even need another marketing based bok."
5,Classic in electronic music!,"If you love trance or any electronic mucic , get this cd.I bought this cd on recommendation of the first rewiever who sounds like he knows what he's talking about. I am simply trying to put together a library of good music of all genres of music, from jazz,classical rock to electronic. Yes I have the Sashas and Digweeds and Warrens and I love them all but Frequencies holds a very special place in my cd library right next to Kind of Blue , The Dark Side of The Moon and Toccata and Fugue in D minor.I have a great respect for Mr.Fracois K. and the music that he creates. This review is the very least I can do to repay him."
3,Very okay,"Thisssss book wassssss very good but it had too much sssssstuff about ssssnakessss. It gave me nightmaresssss. P.S. Sssorry, my 'ssssss' key kept getting sssstuck."
5,A BOOK TO GO ALONG SIDE THE HOLY BOBLE ON YOUR NIGHTSTAND,"In reading this book I felt like I was being schooled by some of the greatest mind's of the last 500 years. As I am of middle age and having survived the ""GO,GO 80'S"" and the ""DOT.COM 90'S"" I was searching for something to expand my horizon's in a ""MEDITATIVE"" and ""SPIRITUAL"" manner, and this book does that. Being a disillusioned ""CATHOLIC"" at the moment this book gives me the hope and support I need to support my church ""ST. PATRICK'S CATHOLIC CHURCH IN BAY SHORE, LONG ISLAND"" so it can return to the great institution ""GOD"" intended it to be. So if you see someone 'BOBBING"" and ""WEAVING"" in the surf of life, toss them a copy of ""WATER PEOPLE"" to calm their souls. I think for the money you can not go wrong."
4,Disney and Kids.,"The classic cartoon that began the Walt Disney Company is now available as a children's book. All the wonderful scenes from that cartoon short are found here. However, much is lost because STEAMBOAT WILLIE is connected to sound and in a book there is no sound. Also, the cartoon doesn't make a very good children's book. Still, it is STEAMBOAT WILLIE and it's a nice piece of literature to introduce anyone to the cartoon that made Mickey a star."
3,Contains Some Good Info But Amateurish,"This could actually be a good book if it had been edited and produced by professionals. Instead, it has convoluted writing,...crude cartoons that pass for illustrations and plastic spiral binding that seems to have come from the corner print shop. It does, however, contain a good amount of hard information. The author should seek a real publisher and relaunch this book."
2,VERY OUT OF DATE! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"This book offers great info...for 1997! Times have changed A LOT! The world of cyberporn is so highly competitive that the tips in this book are ridiculously outdated. Don't waste your money unless you have it to burn. There are very few, if any, viable ideas and tips that you can actually use in today's cyberporn market."
3,a reader,"sure, This book made me hundreds of thousands of dollars, no - a million dollars...I highly suggest it!"
5,Keeps you coming back for more,"I've had this CD for several years - along with Suspended Night and Lontano (and Leosia...yes, pretty much all of Stanko's music that I can find). It has taken awhile for Soul of Things to reveal all of its treasures to me, but reveal it has. Beautifully recorded (naturally - it is an ECM production), patient to unfold, this is jazz to curl up to. Though the tracks are not named and the intent appears to be to look at a set of themes from different points of view, each has its own distinct personality and plenty of tuneful hooks. This is not blowing jazz, but a perfect melding of the talents of a youngsters with a jazz legend. All contributors shine on this one and it cannot be recommended more highly. To me, it stands just slightly above Suspended Night, which itself edges out Lontano - but I really wouldn't want to be without any of them."
3,"A nice ""cloudy day"" CD","This was my first listen to Stanko, and I initially wrote off this CD as another ripoff of the classic 1960's Miles Davis Quintet sound, but without a Wayne Shorter to complicate things. Repeated listenings have revealed Stanko to be a player steeped in Davis melancholy, but with his own things to say and (at times) a fiery way of saying them. His band is respectful to the point of almost sounding afraid to interrupt him. Thoughtful, elegant stylings for those cloudier days - and, in the classic ECM cliché, understated at times to the point of being almost invisible."
1,Conventional,"This is pretty conventional music without any harmonic, rhytmic or melodic inventiveness. Good only for background music."
4,When this all meant something,"This is an effort by an aspiring Anthony Green and one of his early bands. I am generally pleased with most offerings from Green and I must say I did enjoy this as well. But compared to his other work it pales in comparison. It is an obscure ride, with songs like 'Flower, fist, and beastial wail,' you're never quite sure what they're talking about. I still enjoy going back to it every now and then as it holds a certain charm, in fact it is arranged very nicely, starting of with the slow, entrancing 'show your teeth,' then gradually building into some more fast paced songs.If you're an Anthony Green fan you will most likely warm up to this album, as long as you don't take it too seriously."
2,Practice,"Audience of One gave their best shot in making something work. I don't believe that the vocals delivered by Anthony Greene were as quite as n'sync with the rest of the music. The band could not find proper ways to tie in transitions betweens steady beats, sparatic lead-ins, or chaotic explosive harmony. The entire album was a failed, but valiant rookie attempt at polishing anything from a rough garage-style sound. In Anthony Greene's second go at finding his place in the sun, he must have landed a godsend with the formation of Saosin. Pro-active listeners who were left starved with the mere fifteen minuete of Saosin with their EP; Translating the Name; will not find compensation with the sound or vocals in this album."
1,Does not work on Windows XP w/ Service Pack 2,"When I installed this software, I received a DMA.exe error and the program halted. I tried this on both XP Home and XP Pro systems. If you want to run this program under Windows XP (either Home or Professional), it will not work. All of my systems, both Home and Pro, have Service Pack 2 installed, so I don't know if it works on non-updated systems.If those are the versions of Windows you have available, then you should probably get the Magic Artist Deluxe version, which claims it can run on XP."
2,Frustrating and sometimes fun,"I agree with the first review, however, by starting it over and over again, sometimes clicking the mouse durring the intro, it eventually starts. When it does start I agree with the second review."
4,Just a Sound Blaster Live with extra software,"The Sound Blaster Live +MP3 is a great card but it is just the standard Sound Blaster Live with extra bundled software. I was expecting some type of additional hardware acceleration for mp3 playback and encoding but the price still isn't bad for the great sound quality. Some of the software is pretty useless, however I found the encoding software to be great with encoding support up to 360 Kb/s and full CDDB support. The software also goes nicely with my Nomad as it makes it easy to increase the volume of a quiet recording or add special effects easily."
5,Most Bang For The Buck!,"I bought the Soundblaster Live! to replace an onboard sound card that was Direct-Sound ""compatible"", but not a true Direct Sound card. An audio program that I used frequently did not run reliably with the old sound card. Installing the Soundblaster Live!, made all of the difference. I found the installation process to be simple (be sure to disable your old sound card under ""System"" in Control Panel before installing the Soundblaster) and the documentation to be adequate. The included software bundle was an added bonus. The audio program I use takes advantage of the extra speaker outputs on the Soundblaster Live! and uses them for a cue channel. I use my PC to record and edit sound files for radio and TV production and I really like the features of the Soundblaster which include a digital output and the rear speaker output as well as the audio quality it produces. I would highly recommend it for anyone with a home recording studio and believe it's a good value."
2,"Good sound card, bad drivers","The drivers for the SBLive have never been great. With Windows 2000 the drivers were horrible. With Windows XP, you can have basic functionality, but instally Liveware (required to get all the features from the card) will cause system instability, etc. Don't buy this for XP!"
2,Not for Win2000 - Can't plug in speakers and mic at same tim,"The main reason I got this was because I upgraded my system from Win98 to Win2000. Unfortunately it did not come with the Win2000 drivers and I had to download them. The problem is then that the download does not give you all the software (mixing, recording...) which really shrinks the value.Also, the jacks are too close that I can't put in my mic and speaker/headphones at the same time. Duh!!If you have win2000 or think you might go there (I like it) get another card."
5,Whoa . . .,"WOW!! I just bought this book and it's amazing. CLAMP's artwork is truly amazing!! Every single picture is beautiful and it's well worth buying this book whether you're a fan of X or not. The details are beautiful, and if you're a lover of angels, this book is chock full of bishonen with wings!! The book is divided into different sections....some focus on Kamui, and some on the Seven Seals and Habringers. Great artwork, great book. Go buy it. You won't be sorry. ^_^"
4,Simple and powerful.,"This is a highly accessible book, with simple and powerful concepts that can be applied from the first moment you read them, and which can make a significant difference to how you perceive yourself and how others perceive you."
4,Inspiration and Much Useful,"I too was suprised at some of the negative comments.I have my own copy of this book and the publisher (microcosmpublishing) isvery clear its layout isn't super perfect... it is photocopied from 'zines, which actualy gives is a nice authentic feel, and it's almost always legible.There is a lot here from food to clothes to health, to other DIY, saving money,from pratical necessities, to areas related to fun/art/entertainment (see the full description) It's not perfect, and you may need to pick and choose as I have whatparts are most useful to you, but for the money you get a very good dealand more than enough areas (if you are at all interested in DIY) to gleanideas and inspiration from."
1,Save your money ... buy something else ...,"Yes, the book does have some good information. Unfortunately a lot of it is illegible - being a reduced copy of hand-written scritch scratch. But that's not the worst part, which is that more than half of the items have nothing to do with ""making stuff and doing things"". It's more like ""The worst guide ever to your body and yourself."" What sexual activity or tampon alternatives have to do with the title is beyond me. Definitely R-rated and not for kids. The good stuff can all be found on the Internet, and the bad stuff you can do without. A real waste of money."
1,terrible overall,I got this book thinking it might be an interesting or useful read and it was neither. The book is poorly put together and has very little useful information. Don't waste your money on it.
1,Keep Looking!,Impossible to read/follow. It's just looks like a print out of a website with lots of lists. Very cheaply done. It gave me a headache to look at.
4,"A FUN, INTERESTING AND ENTERTAINING BOOK!","Well, I originally purchased this book for one of my nieces who was expecting; however, I have a new kitten, and I wanted to give him a unique name. His name is now Winston. My niece did choose a very, very, very unique name for their baby, but I'm not sure they found it in this book. Although, I really do think they did. 8]------------------------------------------------------SEPTEMBER 29, 2008 UPDATEWell, another niece of mine is expecting in 2009, so I am purchasing this book again. I really do think you will find several names to choose from with the help of this book."
2,Greatly disappointed,"While there are some interesting parts of this book, the bulk is lists of names by their origin. That would be great if you knew where names you like came from. If this book had an index of names it would make a huge difference, but it doesn't."
5,Excellent book!,"This book is really singular. It has very many interesting categories, which is missing to other books much. It is varied. But first of all it is very helpful, if one liked to find the fullcoming name."
1,Terrible book - why all the positive reviews?,"Are these reviews from the author's friends and family? This book is a joke. No offense, but it looks like info culled off the internet and copy-pasted into a word documented, printed to an inkjet, photocopied and bound. Even worse, much of the information is inaccurate. I showed some of the foreign name sections to native speakers, and they laughed at some of the ridiculous errors. Buyer beware -- do not name your child based on this book without confirming elsewhere. I would hate to have children named based on false information."
1,Disappointing Book,"This book looks like it has been written in and printed from Word. It's even printed on 8 1/2"" by 11"" paper. The names are only divided by nationality. Many of the names are repeated 2 or 3 times. There are errors in formatting and in name placement. For example, the name Sinead is listed under the Irish Male Names, but then has ""female"" as the origin, ""Irish"" as the meaning, and ""gracious"" as similar names. Under the Hungarian section there are several names which have the origin listed as Indian. Given how few names are included, there shouldn't be so many errors. Very Disappointing book...I had to return it."
3,Not an easy learning tool,"This is more of a reference book designed for walking around Germany and being able to flip through the pages and hold a basic conversation. I expected it to be a lesson, but it was just lists after lists of words. Not very helpful."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A departure from the epic length Queen books, this novel is also set onTiamat. BZ Gundhalinu features in what is basically a crime novel. Thecity it is set in is where people come for their longevity drugs. Ayoung policeman is involved in a raid on an illegal technology store.The Snow Queen wants the gear there, his police sergeant (acharacter from the other books) thinks he is useless, and there is amysterious femme fatale type also making life more annoying.A very dangerous mystery that at the end of it involves very high stakes."
3,LA Confidential on Tiamat,"A quick read, geared toward those who've read the rest of the books in the series. A couple points that were left lingering in the other books were cleared up. The book doesn't have the depth of the Snow Queen, however. I also thought the plot was similar to the movie LA Confidential. Privileged officer paired up with a street cop from a blue collar background, the whole love story, and the corruption in the police department."
4,A 14 year old's review,"After reading The Snow Queen, I was a little disappointed at how this book did not carry the mythical mystique and mystery that I had hoped it would. It was pretty good, although some of the main characters I felt were underdeveloped, and that some of the terms used in the book aren't described in enough detail. (What is Survey?) However, The plot is original and well thought out, and I thought that the imagery was excellent. The descriptiveness of the settings surrounding the characters makes Tiamat come to life."
2,"Slow going, too much foul language","Unlike her earlier books, this one was very easy to put down each night. It's much shorter but took me longer to read - a tell-tale sign that it's not very engaging.I was also taken-aback at her fascination with the f-word in this book. I often pass a lot of my books to my children to read, but this one is going back to the library unread by my kids."
2,beginning hackers only,"I concur with the other reviews, I bought this on whim at a trade show.. the cover looks better than the contents.. there are some good hacks in here but the author really doesn't appear to know why they work, he just appears to have stumbled on them (like a lot of us do)and documented them. I prefer better explanation when hacking such a critical core component."
2,It's good for beginners...,"On first look, the book is not bad. But when you go deeper, it seems to be a collection of personal experience from other users, and already published by Microsoft entries. I would rate it as an entry level book. The NT resouce kit has a better coverage of the registry."
3,"Informative, but quite repetitive","I learned a couple of things from this book that I didn't already know from reading other books about the film scoring industry. However, I can't agree with the endorsements chosen by the publisher that imply this book breaks new ground, etc.It was very basic, very simple reading, and I got frustrated at how often the author repeated himself. Sometimes, it felt like the same content was actually copied and pasted from one section to another.If this is one of the first books you read on the subject, it might prove to be quite helpful to you. But it's by no means a major work. Some of the anecdotes included are humorous, and I enjoyed the ""insider"" feel when reading it. But overall, I came away wishing I had gotten a lot more depth and not so much repetitive fluff."
3,Overall: good,"This is a good overview book of film music. I own and have read a variety of these types of books, and this holds pretty well. However, i would suggest the Berklee Press book by Richard Davis as well."
5,A Real World Approach to Real Estate Investment.,"Real estate has proven in the past to be a very good investment for a very large number of people. Much of that has come from sheer luck as they bought a house kept it for many years and then solf it for a very good profit.This book talks about how to treat real estate like any other investment. That is, the market goes up, and the market goes down. This is not one of those buy distressed property, perhaps cheating the little old lady that owns the house, fixing it up and selling it. Instead it's a pretty good study of every aspect of the real estate business.All in all, I'd only add one thing, go get your real estate license and become a real estate salesman for a local agency. You'll learn about people, you'll learn about real estate in your area, and you'll see her principles in action."
1,This is a ripoff!,"I have RCC and I got this book free, Do not pay for this book!!! It can be ordered for free from the Kidney Cancer Association."
3,"Ok, but nothing like dictators circus","this is the second Pierrot album I've listened to. The first was dictators circus, and it was unlike any J-rock I've heard before. Moody, dark, and a little chaotic. This one being the second was a bit of a surprise. only two of the songs sounded anything like the last album. In a nutshell it seemed a little too...happy. All in all not a bad album, but then again it's not something to lose your head over.Get dictators circus. -Neo_Kage"
3,Big disappointment,"This CD was way overrated when it came out. The only songs that were good were the singles and Acid Rain... Most of the songs sound too similar, and it seems like they weren't really trying to be creative... Pierrot is by far my favorite band, but this CD just doesn't give them justice... My rating of a 3 is only that high because I love them so much. I really wouldn't recommend buying this. It sounds too punk-pop for their music. This album seems like Pierrot has lost what make them individual."
5,Not as bad as others would say,"Pierrot's new album including 4 singles; ""Barairo no Sekai"" (intro thme to the anime ""Get Backers""), ""Psychedelic Lover"", ""Neo-grotesque"", and ""Hill - Genkaku no Yuki"".1. a pill2. Psychedelic Lover3. Daybreak4. Upper Flower5. Neogrotesque6. Kakumei no kuroi tsubasa7. Acid Rain8. Hill -Genkaku no yuki-9. God Bless10. Morning Junky11. Barairo no sekai (album mix)12. Answer"
2,Creative Failure x2,"This is the second Creative product I have gotten in the last 4 months that has completley bombed. This soundcard sounds great, it has some great software but it's as plug and play as my atari 2600. On a clean windows 98 install I found out what was wrong with it. It was having a pci conflict and a irq error. It wanted irq 5 which wasn't a problem but it was odd. I tried it in a few other pci slots and still no go. I tore out my USR 56.6 and bingo it worked. I put the modem back in and re-assigned a few things. It kind of worked. But basically it only works at 100% if I kept the modem out. Which is fine and dandy if I didn't just buy the modem. So the card went back. Hey, it sounds great but I talked to about 6 techs who all had the same problem with it and who all had to re-assign settings to get it to work. But like Creatives burner I don't have the time to mess with settings. When I pay money I want it to work the first time ;).I'm going to try a yamaha"
4,My Bathtub was invaded,10 year old die hard lego fan loves this. It now lives in Bathroom. His new wish list includes more sets from this line
4,Great product,I have 2 of these on two different gates (one a 14' gate) and they work great. My 7 year old can swing the 14' gate very easily. I installed one to the side of one gate and on the other gate I installed it directly underneath the gate and they have both worked fine. I have had them for about 4 months and go through the one gate 4 or 5 times a day on average and it hasn't slipped yet. I think the negative review poster needs to tighten the bolts down on his.
2,Superfluous recording.,"I'm generally a Sawallisch fan, but these two symphonies are performed in a bland and perfunctory manner. The sonics are fine, but there are many better choices, including many in as good or better sound. This particular recording has virtually nothing to recommend it, unless you fanatically and compulsively collect every recording of these works, Sawallisch, or the Philadelphia orchestra.It may be cheap, but it's no bargain. If you want something that's cheap (assuming that you buy from Marketplace sellers), sounds better, and is infinitely better as a performance, try KubelikDvorák: Symphonies 8 & 9 / Kubelik, Berlin Philharmonic Orchestraor MehtaDvorak: Symphonies Nos. 8 & 9 ""From the New World"" [Australia]."
1,A Terrible Disappointment...,"I'm not sure why this recording was given 5 stars. I bought this recording without reading any reviews. A look at the Penguin Guide to classical music mentions a number of serious flaws in this recording, and I wish I had read it before buying this cd. In comparing this recording to a cheaper, generic version of Dvorak's 8th I found that this recording was totally inadequate. Sawallisch's rendition is played with a very noticeable lack of passion. In fact it's the coldest, most dispassionate playing of Dvorak I've ever heard. And by the way, even if you like your tempo fast, Sawallisch rushes along like it's a race to the finish line, as if an unwilling participant with little affection for the music."
4,WOW!!!,"Wonderfully written book! Mrs. Robinson is a passionate writer that believes in details. In reading this book I felt like I knew these people and was living their experience with them... The way she put the words together to describe the people, their setting and situation displayed nothing less than a desire and talent for writing. Hats off to you Joanna!"
1,The Baby's here,I was very dissapointed in the seller. It was advertised as new and was very used. This was a gift for my Granddaughter and now I have to try and find a NEW one.
1,NO WAY IS THIS A PG MOVIE!!!,Seriously! nudity and very adult themes in my opinion. How this got beyond the sensors I dont know.And the ending is scarring. I would say 14 is maybe an ok age to watch at the youngest.I would think it would be R rated.
5,"Elegant, Classy, Magical!!!!!!","I had heard about Diane through the grapevine and picked up Midnight and it has been in my CD player ever since. She brings to mind a female Frank Sinatra. You are transported to a NYC jazz club circa 1952. Her voice is so versatile,and Barry Manilow does an excellent job producing and writing a lot of the music. The first track Meet Me, Midnight is beautiful and the CD never lets up and includes some great duets with Brian McKnight and Barry. ""Deedles"" as she is affectionately known has won me over and I strongly suggest it for fans of female jazz vocals like Norah Jones and Dianne Krall."
2,Subtle as an alarm clock,"Schuur has talent but lacks restraint. She's quite showy, and presses, often slipping into embarrassing bombast. The vibrato and sustain would be impressive if this were ""The Sound of Music"".This is an ego driven vocalist. All singers are in love with the sound of their own voice, but most have a knack for not letting on. At her best she eases back and rides the tune, content to let her pretty tone do the impressing. See, ""Our Love Will Always Be There"".She has that mannered, hard R, over-enunciated phrasing, which she executes naturally and with true personality. The vocal treatment is brassy and far forward in the mix, and it doesn't meld well with the instrumentation, which sounds isolated, as if off in another room.In short she's a bit of an odd bird and likes to squawk."
4,What's taking so long,I submitted a rather full review two weeks ago and it still hasn't been posted. What's the delay?
3,"Diane Schuur's ""Midnight""","OK, here's my review for Diane Schuur's ""Midnight""..The songs were great, but being that I'm a Barry fan, my favorite Barry album is indeed 2AM Paradise Cafe. The way Diane Schuur sang ""When October Goes"" was ehh, ok .. but I cringed when I heard her singing ""in my aRRRRmmss"" -- she stressed(?)the letter R in the word ""arms"" which was a big turn-off to me.Since Barry produced this album, I'm suprised he approved of that part? What happened? What was he thinking? He sings that song allot better & makes it sound excellent without anyone wanting to cringe! As a matter of fact, he can sing any song without anyone wanting to cringe(except for those who don't care for Barry & his music) - he sings every song so beautiful. I'm not a Diane Schuur fan but I was only interested in this album because Barry produced it. Anyway, I was impressed with the other songs though except that small part in ""When October Goes""."
4,"S, Puking and Crying",This is a unique compilation of songs that are brutally honest and are represented through electronical instruments along with strong voices. May take a while to grow on you but something always makes me come back for more.
3,It's OK.,"I beg to differ from you but to me it seems similar. The beat is a little almost unnoticeable faster, but that is the merengue out there today. It's ""listenable""."
3,HELPPPPP !!!!!!!!!!,"To me ,this book was okay .I think it was'nt scary at all !The other Goosebumps were okay exept for this one .I think this was'nt such a good book 'cause people know that lizards as big as us don't exist !"
4,Just dial 555-CREEP,"Not exactly the best plot for a book, especially ahorror story. But Stine turned on his talent and turned thisplot in to a horror- comedy book.It starts out as a super dorky guy tries to get revengeon his enemy. He meets a girl and gets mysterious calls atduring the middle of the night.Their his friends all right, friends who gulp downsquirells and have purple scales all over their body.... andthey call themselves... CREEPS.If he does'nt act fast, everybody might turn intopurple scaled, squirrel eating creeps"
2,Not good enough,"This was the stupidist idea of a book ever! This bit, but the only good part washow he turned a dumb idea into a decent book. Still sucks. Worst Goosebump ever."
4,Calling all Creeps,"If you like monsters and fights and scary stuff then this is the fantasy book for you. The book is Goosebumps calling all creeps. This book is kind of like The Incredible Hulk. Because they are normal people then they turn into monsters. Ricky Beamer has problems like us Jarsed, David, Brenda and Wart bully him and beat him up.I like this book because kids can turn into big purple lizards and they eat squirrels. I would recommend if you don't like monsters, you might not like reading this book. If you read this book BEWARE of the purple lizards!!!By: Shaquille Thunder Hawk"
3,Unnumbered,"This was exactly as described, but it is not the numbered original print. It's a great book, but I ended up ordering the original one instead and gave this copy to my son."
3,Goosebumps Series by Different Printer,"Just a note to be cautious if your intent is to add to a current collection. Even though the books have the number in the listing, the spine may not be numbered. When I called AMAZON, I was told there was a different printer doing the processing of the books now and that ""they didn't have the numbers to print"". The covers are slightly different, as well. Books are the same reading. I have questioned a couple of sellers, but often times they are shipping from a warehouse and just do not know which printing is being shipped. (This is not an issue because AMAZON will take care of any order problem - just a word of caution when ordering these particular books.)"
4,"Good, I like it","The tone block I received was not the same color. Perhaps I missed the disclaimer ""colors may vary"" but really, my son doesn't much care what color it is. Also, the tone block I received did not come with a mallet. It came with a small stick that functions, but not as well as a mallet would."
5,Very Fast Shipping!,"I ordered this gum for my grandmother who had been looking, but couldn't find it anywhere. The shipping was extremely fast, and the product was just what she was looking for. Thanks for making my Grandma's day!!!"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH QUALIITY,"NOT VERY WELL MADE AND LOCKET DOESN'T STAY CLOSED NOR DOES THE PICTURE STAY IN IT'S PLACE...VERY PRETTY TO LOOK AT, BUT CAN'T WEAR IT..."
2,Worked great for the first year,"Its a very nice mirror and worked great for the first year. No loss of suction, never fell off. However, starting in year two, it would never keep suction. I tried cleaning the window and the suction cup; huffing a little moisture onto it prior to sticking, not huffing on it, nothing worked and so I went without a mirror. Plus you cant really make it go above your windshield, so it blocks some of the forward view. It was a quality mirror for the price, but now its in the give-away box. Will be buying a clamp-on that I can position above my windshield. So I do not recommend this product."
3,Good for the price,"Must be VERY careful in adjusting the ""ball and socket"", which is under the rubber cover. I had to loosen the 2 bolts that held it in, so it would move easier. I had read a lot about the ""pot metal ""arm"" breaking off. The ball will be in a position that will not let it move, due to an angle on the arm. If it does not move easy, look at it close and see if it is the arm angle that is causing it to bind, if so change the position of the ball.I also had to put a slight amount of silicon grease on the suction to make it hold"
5,Great mirror,I have used this mirror for one season. When placed on my windshield it stays in place. Make your adjustments before you adhere it to your windshield. I use it on my Bowrider center winshield and open or closed it stays in place.
1,"""NO stick suction"" boat mirror","This CIPA model 11050 suction rear view ski mirror is OEM original equipment for a $29,000 Yamaha jet-boat model AR 210. Well in 50 words or less.. wont stick to windshield.suction cup too stiff even if left in sun to soften up still a no go! I tried to attach w every thing but crazy glue products and still no sucess. In fact while tryting to attach to my GPS mount the mounting swivel bar broke off. Not suprised since it made of soft poured lead."
1,ARRIVED BROKEN!,Would give this no stars... The mirror adjustor was snapped out of package... Completely broken and unusable ? Would not recommend buying this product!
1,Suction cup doesn't work,"I purchased this item based on a recommendation on my RV forum to use in my motorhome, so I could watch the coach behind me when I was driving, since I don't have a rear view mirror inside the coach. I couldn't put it on the windshield because I have an electric sunshade that it would interfere with, so I tried to put it on top of my dash, but it wouldn't stick. I then purchased an adhesive disk, also from Amazon, that is supposed to work with suction cup mounts exactly like this. I tried the two together, because I didn't want to stick the adhesive to the dash until I was sure it would work. No matter how I pushed the cup onto the disk, it wouldn't hold, so now I'm stuck with both a useless mirror and a useless disk."
1,"Looks good, broke when I took it out of the package","Thought this would be perfect for the boat when I saw it this winter. Ordered and received with no issues. Finally took it out of the package to put on the boat this weekend and it immediately broke. The mounting is obviously just not durable. The tension in the ball joint that has to be overcome to adjust the angle imparts enough force on the rod to break it.Since I waited to try it, I missed my window to return it."
1,Don't bother,"Yesterday I unpackaged and mounted it. Today it broke when I tried to adjust it the first time. Not sure it's worth the shipping charge to Michigan to get warranty coverage. So CIPA wins, I guess."
1,Broke in first 5 minutes,The shank that connects the adjustment ball to the back of the mirror is pot metal. I put a slight amount of pressure on the mirror to align it and it just snapped in half. Now worthless.
2,"Nice design, poor quality","If they had spent a bit more on better materials, this would have been a great mirror. Inside that nice thick ribbed boot, is a very thin metal rod, cast from some kind of grainy(like sand), low quality metal. The first time I tried to adjust it, it snapped off in my hand. Buyer beware."
1,Bad,"This item is not made for pontoon, but tried and was very disappointed with it the suction cup would not work any where you put it, it would fall right off. I would not recommend it to any one."
1,too heavy for suction cup,We bought this for our golf cart. The mirror is very heavy. Too heavy for the suction cup to hold it on the windshield.
5,Nice ski mirror,Cheaper off Amazon than in the local boating stores. The mirror works well for spotting wakeboarders while you're driving. The suction cup mount works well and avoids clamps which tend to scar or other mounts that might require permanent mounting holes. Recommended.
2,Broke after a couple of days,"We used this a baby mirror in our car. The suction cup worked great and the mirror had a really good picture. However, when we went to adjust it after having it for just a couple of days the rod that holds the mirror broke. We are in the process of returning it.:("
2,"very poor suction, but nice mirror","I bought this to use in my car as a big mirror to see my child, but it won't stick to the window long. The suction design is not strong enough for the weight of this mirror, and it is heavy."
3,Works well,"Sturdy, easy to mount although the suction mount dies need a very clean and smooth surface. If buying again, i would probably get a larger mirror, but this one is just fine. Good product."
5,"Great for use in the car, too!","The rear view mirror in the car has fallen off three times in the past few years (always in HOT weather), and I am tired of putting in back on. So, I bought this to stick on the windshield where the original mirror mount was. Works great, very sturdy, and gives a better rear view than the original mirror. Pretty much eliminates the blind spots. Does has a wide-angle image, and takes a bit of getting used to, but provides a safer view of what is behind your car. Plus, cleaning the inside windshield will be easier--I'll just remove this mirror to make the job go faster. No more trying to clean the smears around the permanent mirror."
1,Absolute garbage,Broke during installation. The mounting bracket is cast metal that is very weak. This mirror broke while I was pressing the down to attach the suction cup. Exceptionally disappointing that this terrible product is offered by Amazon.
2,Broke Before First Use,"Cheap POT Aluminum arm between the suction cup and the mirror broke when adjusting - I determined the cause; the ball and socket assembly that is supposed to be the swivel point was over-tightened and did not allow any movement so all my twisting did was bend (and break) the connecting arm.I think a stainless steel part would solve the issue best, but you could check the tightness of the ball and socket before adjusting and avoid breaking the arm as is.The suction cup is large silicone and should hold well, the mirror also is large and I beleive it would be a great product if they changed the connecting hardware between the two."
3,Good Purchase,"This has fallen off twice now and I am getting tired of putting it back up (span of about two weeks). I will be giving my car a thorough cleaning and will try again afterwards. Maybe that will be the issue.*Update*I originally bought two of these. One for my wife's car and one for mine. They are used to see the back seat where our daughters car seat sits. In my car, no matter what I do, it continuously falls off. In my wife's car however it works like a charm. There must be something about the glass in mine so my rating has upgraded and I do believe this is a good purchase, it does exactly what we need it to do (in my wife's car only)."
2,Broke on the first try to adjust,The mirror is great as stated on the other reviews. It's large and very good to watch your child on the backseat.The suction is very strongHowever the support (the metal stick with a ball on one end) that holds the mirror broke on my first try to adjust. So be careful.
2,Can't tell a difference,It seems to be a good moisturiser but can't really tell any tone change. It smells like food cooking ..... not sure what that's all about but the smell is weird for lotion.
3,Okay....,"Didn't really work for my skin, it was okay. It worked a tiny bit. There's no special scent to it, it's average, so next time I buy tone repair I'm buying another product."
2,This was not what I Thought it would be!!!!,"First off, when i recieved this product in the mail i thought it was something else because it was very small, not much bigger than a carmex jar. I used up the first jar and didnt see any results. I know it takes a while for a product to work sometimes so i went ahead and purchased another jar. I am not pleased at all, still no results...Do not buy this."
3,Okay..,I feel like this product is working but it takes a while. I use it with my micro needle roller.
1,Doesn't work,"I have pretty bad acne scars and this didn't do anything to them, it kind of helps the razor redness mark things but it really is not good not worth the money look around for something else."
5,Wife loves it...,"I bought this for my wife and she loves it. She recommends it 100%, says the price for the product is great and it outperforms brands such as L'oreal, Neutrogena, etc. She got great results in two weeks with this cream."
2,Disappointing,"This is a very very disappointing product, since I haven't tried it yet I'll give it a two star product. But when I got the product from the mail it is very small, in my opinion it isn't work $7. The product says it's 1.6 oz... nope that is a BIG FAT LIE! When I got the product it is only .5 oz. Beware buyers... it's a scam!Oh and if you wanted to return the item, you have to pay for the shipping itself!"
4,"Commoners, Tribute, and Chiefs","Potter combines findings from ethno-history, archaeology, and anthropology to trace the living patterns of natives occupying the Potomac Valley during the years from 200 to 1700. In particular, Potter uses these findings to trace the Chicacoan political organization, social behavior, and settlement patterns as they changed over time showing how and why the Chicacoans went from being a distinct group before contact with Europeans to moving to new land and merging with two other tribes and becoming the Wicocomoco by the latter 1600s and finally becoming landless tenants living on an English plantation. Potter shows that Chicacoan life (as well as the living patterns of other native groups in the region) was affected by changing subsistence patterns (increasing importance of agriculture), increasing population, conflicts with neighboring tribes, changing climate, and finally contact with Europeans."
1,Not recommended,"Just got the book and about 55 pages into it and felt I needed to vent. This author may know his subject very well but has no idea how to convey it to the newbie builder. The point of a book like this should be to explain the material in such a way to help someone who has never built a guitar to do so. His explanation of making a mold starts out with you the reader coming up with a design based on looking at pretty color pictures. Huh? He tries to explain about a shooting board and go-bar press assuming you already know something about it. Next he tries to explain a curved template in a way that I just don't get. Is this for an arched top guitar and if so why not say so? I think I am wasting my time trying to read this book. I got suckered into thinking this was a good book to own by the abundant color pictures. This is a coffee table book-""oh look at the lovely pics""- not to be confused with a how to on building a guitar. Anybody want to buy a used book?"
4,pretty cool,In the future I will attempt to build my own guitar. It does seem that this book will be beneficial in that process. Ask me again in a year!
4,What to read first,"""Build Your Own Acoustic Guitar"" is the 2nd book you should read and is a great layout or outline for you while building your guitar. However, ""Guitar Making"" by Cumpiano & Natelson is still the most detailed, fact filled book on guitar making. I keep both on the shelf side by side."
4,Good book,"Good book. Author build a guitar almost from scratch using many hand tools. Author is even a bit motivational- telling the reader to have faith, focus on the task, and it will all go together. I wish it had more detail on building the various jigs and fixtures. I felt that I would likely need additional text to build a guitar, but this is a good book none the less. I was impressed by the authors extensive use of simple hand tools."
5,ok book,Im building my own guitar. this book is helpful not great. Lots of info but you will need more than this book.
3,"Good for an introduction to guitar building, but won't complete one with this book alone.",Lacking many measurements to complete a guitar with this book alone. Dose not have side templates. Not a lot about necks. Pretty pictures take up most of the pages. But a good introduction to terms and an understanding of building a guitar.
3,"Not just any guitar, this exact guitar.","I got this book, along with two other books in the same genre. The images are in color and very detailed. The instructions are fairly easy to follow. Why three stars and not more? Because this book is really about building a replica of a Kinkead guitar. I wanted instructions with more depth, more discussion of variations and explanations. I found that elsewhere. So, if you want a book that will walk you through building a Kinkead steel string guitar, and only that, buy this book. If you want a book that will take you through the breadth and depth of building classical and steel string guitars, with detailed instructions and explanations, buy something else."
4,"Old game, good fun!",I expected this game to be exactly what it is and purchased it for nostalgic reasons. It's a fun thing to own and I received it very quickly after I ordered it. Great experience and fun old game :)
2,Wagner in two dimensions,"I read the reviews before buying this, and they were mixed. Mine is also mixed. Not an audiophile by any stretch, nor an authority on classical music or Wagner, I was somewhat disappointed in this compared to other performances I have heard of the same pieces. These are rather flat, workmanlike renditions, probably very true note for note but without any feeling or passion. But, you get what you pay for, I guess."
5,A MUST READ FOR ALL AMERICANS.,"The ""Shot heard 'round the World"" was a year after the American Revolution began with major force."
5,great shirt,I recently purchased a black cotton tee shirt withe the Navy SEAL logo on it both front and back. It fits great and the feel of cotton is awesome. I highly recommend this product. Good luck with your shopping.
2,Thriller minus the thrills.,"The House That Vanished (Jose Ramon Larraz, 1973)Larraz' atmospheric, though ultimately dull, chiller about two thieves, a model (For Men Only's Andrea Allen) and her boyfriend (Vampyres' Karl Lanchbury), who stumble upon an old house and set about looting it, only to discover that murders have been committed there very recently. Afterwards, the model tries to find the house again. The title should tell you what happens. The setup and glacial pace put one in mind of the first hour (i.e., the bad part) of The Haunted House of Horror, released a few years previous, but unlike that one, this never even attempts to break any rules, preferring to go the classic-thriller route. Problem is, there are few thrills here. Some decent acting, and the atmosphere, but little else. *"
2,You get what you pay for.,"I figured that I couldn't go wrong with an inexpensive radio, but I was wrong. The radios actually function just fine in terms of range and clarity. The problem is that they are just poorly made. The first time one was dropped (and yes they will all eventually be dropped) it kind of exploded and did not go back together well. The battery location and means of holding in the batteries is much less than ideal, and just not well designed. I never tried the ear bud microphone because it was too poorly made to fit properly in my ear without pain. In sum, this was a cheap pair of radios that have confirmed the wisdom of shelling out the extra money for some well-made Motorollas. At least I have an extra set of radios when the need arises."
2,"Functionally ok, physically could be better","I purchased 2 sets of these radios to use while on a family trip to Disney World. They did work ok, but the protective rubber cover on the bottom of all 4 radios was lost within the first day of using them. This does not seem like a big thing, but the cover serves as protection in case they are dropped and also keeps the battery compartment cover from sliding off. If the design is changed, I may purchase them again, but for now, I have returned all 4 with the chargers."
3,Not bad for a budget radio,"Quality is decent, though the on/off volume knob feels cheap. Good range in the suburbs. Included belt clip a plus. Will only take the FRS-EM8 and the FRS-EMC8 earbud microphones"
5,Beautiful music for the soul,"This music is a delight to the soul, even if listening to it reminds you of something that breaks your heart."
2,Try something else,I kept it in my car. the pin was flimsy this I noticed right away; rounding a corner yesterday the pin came out and the whole thing discharged all over the inside of my car. I will buy one of those new smaller compact extinguishers before I will mess with one of these ever again. It will take months to clean the mess up.
1,Literally the WORST thing I have ever bought!,"First of all, this set came with only one piece.The pic shows a framed painted tile with an iron hook and porcelain knob. In reality, it is a stamped tin frame holding a HORRIBLE color-print on a piece of office paper behind a piece of glass. Oh, and that porcelain knob -- it's actually plastic, and it is covered with sharp bits of glue or resin.An absolute wast in every way. Please do yourself a favor, and avoid these!"
2,A disappointed buyer,"This is a nice little walkman, the sound is very good the hold feature is nice to prevent accidentally switching stations if you're carrying it in a purse or backpack. The major fault I find with it and the reason I gave it two stars are the headphones, they are very uncomfortable, the foam ear pieces are very thin and actually hurt your ears a bit even though they don't fit closely. Also with the sound down fairly low someone sitting next to me could hear the music quite well, not something you want for a plane trip or sitting on mass transit. I bought this specifically because I liked the idea of having tuning and volume control on a remote on the headphones so I could keep it in my bag and not risk dropping it but the headphones were so bad I wound up using my old pair and foregoing the remote. To bad because it's a nice product except for that."
3,Reynolds best Action Feature,Burt Reynolds is both the star and director of this fast paced action 80's crime thriller based on the story from Elmore Leonard (Get Shorty). Features ground breaking stunts from famous Hollywood stunt man and actor Dar Robinson. Great performances by George Segal and Charles Durning. This film is not yet available on DVD. -sideshowvideo
3,stick,"i always loved that movie,i had it as a vhs,so it was imperative foor me to have it as a dvd.It'S a light action comedy movie with burt reynolds"
1,"Stick, the movie?","Stick: A NovelI had just finished reading the book and when I found out that it had been made into a movie, I was curious.What a waste of money and time. I could not sit through the whole thing. Terrible acting and very dark."
5,"Stick it in my eyeball, please","Stick. Another great movie featuring the explosive Burt Reynolds. You know what, I don't even need to see this movie, because I already know it will own me 100 times over. If it is anything like Malone at all (which I've heard it is), than I am already defeated. Now go buy these classic films to enjoy for all eternity. Until you die, that is."
5,Cool Fricking Action Movie**********!!!!!,"A bad guys worst nightmare, a hero with no fear of death! Fills the vengeance streak in all of us! A must see!!!!! Real life stunts and action!! No CGI here!!!"
2,Release the Director's Cut!,"After a string of box-office disappointments, ""Stick"" (1985) represented Burt Reynolds' last gasp as a major film star. However, this potentially strong Elmore Leonard adaptation was marred by studio-imposed reshoots and the actor's ill health. Director Reynolds has assembled an offbeat cast (notably Charles Durning in a ridiculous fright wig), but the crime thriller suffers from a wildly inconsistent tone. Judging by its atmospheric start, one senses that Burt's original cut was superior to the messy finished product."
5,This one resonates,"The author says, when she was young, she dreamed of walking out of this world and into another. She realized that dream by writing this book. Like many other well-crafted stories for children I have not found this one to be any less sweet when I read it, not (as I did at first) as a young teen, but as an adult. Track down this story at a library, and for a brief while, walk into another world."
4,GREAT HITS-but not enough of them,"Most of the classic hits of the Osmonds are included in these 3 C.d's but, as usual, there are hits missing. Where's ""On the Shelf"",""This is the way that I feel"", ""Who's sorry now"", ""C'mon Marianne"", ""My love is a fire""! All top 40 hits and great songs. They added album cuts instead and the one's chosen are not even the better songs. If you're a new fan, then I recommend this set but for long time fans like myself this is a waste of money,if you're looking for songs new to c.d. The original albums need to be released on C.D!!! Five stars for the OSMOND FAMILY. Two for the people who compiled this so-called box set."
4,BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE!,"SANDRA'S BOOKS USUALLY ARE KIND OF SLOW READING, BUT ENVY WAS VERY WELL WRITTEN. I THOUGHT THAT MARIS'S CHARACTER WAS VERY STRONG WHERE ONE WOULD EXPECT HER TO BE NAIVE, STUPID AND NOT REALLY KNOWING WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND HER. SHE SHOWED US HER STRONG SIDE AT TIMES AND THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE FLOW OF THE BOOK. PARKER AND NOAH'S CHARACTERS WERE SO WELL TWISTED THAT I HAD TO GO BACK TO THE PROLOGUE SEVERAL TIMES JUST TO TRY AND GUESS FOR MYSELF WHAT WAS REALLY HAPPENING. IT WAS GREAT! ALSO, THERE WERE WONDERFUL PLOT TWISTS BETWEEN NADIA, THE GRANDFATHER, AND ESPECIALLY WITH ONE OTHER PERSON - I WON'T TELL 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO RUIN IT FOR OTHERS! :) THIS WOULD MAKE A GOOD MOVIE."
5,envy,"BOY were the reviews right on with this book i loved it, the story kept me interested right up to the end and there were some suprises that you did'nt see coming the only small dissappointment was i would've like to have seen noah's punishment in more detail and it would've been nice to see nadia get hers too just on principle alone for the actions that she did, also the end was a little too THE END, but this book is an excellent read"
5,Envious,"This is the first SB book that I read and it was clever, thoughtful, interesting, suspenseful. She crafts her novels is such an interesting way and her writing style flows so well. The heroine shows strength, intelligence, and wisdom. The hero is hard to like, he is rash, impulsive, rough, bitter yet soulful. You will not regret this fast paced and intriguing novel."
2,A Twinkie,"I have seen this book described as a romantic mystery. There wasn't much mystery. I knew where the story was going after about 60 pages. Romance? Not much. Explicit, uninteresting sex? Yes. I read one of Sandra Brown's earlier novels and remember it only because I disliked it so much. But with all the hype and glowing reviews surrounding this book, I thought I'd give it a try. The beginning...the prolog of the `book within a book'...was very good. I was intrigued and found the character description of the crusty old sailor quite appealing. But the rest of the story was a let down. The writing was okay and the pace moved along at a pretty good clip, but the story line was lightweight and predictable. It wasn't a total waste of time. It was like eating a Twinkie when what you really want is a big slice of triple chocolate cake with fudge frosting."
4,Shockingly Evil,"I really enjoy a book about books, then add a mystery and you have a great story. It was interesting to view books from an editor's point of view. I liked the sections where Maris is working so close with Parker to create and perfect his story. This book was shocking and mind-blowing. Noah was the epitome of evil. I loved how Parker's story and reality all find a way back to the one person who set everything into motion."
2,As bad as her very old ones.,I was very disappointed in this book. I have read everything she has written since French Silk. This reminds me of her very old stuff. I just didn't buy the whole plot and I just didn't like the characters.
2,Mediocre at best...,"As an avid reader of the romantic suspense genre, I was excited to read Sandra Brown's latest work even though I felt her last few books have not packed the punch of her earlier novels. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in what started out as an interesting read. The book was both predictable and slow. Halfway through I started to skim pages just so I could finish the book. In a nutshell, great premise, bad execution."
5,Wonderful Book,This was a great book with lots of twists and turns. My only drawback to it was the foul language and I am not a prude. The book and story were great. I read it twice and have loaned it to several friends to enjoy as well.
5,I found this book VERY enjoyable amd intruging,"I was already a fan of Sandra Brown after reading Exclusive, but after some of her less than steller books (Slow Heat in Heaven was not one of my favorites to say the least) I wasn't sure about her newest one, but I ended up LOVING it.Of course, I find the whole book writing/publishing world fascinating, but there was just something unique about this book. I am usually not surprised by any element of the ending of romantic suspense books because I have read so many, but there was a little bit of a suprise at the end of this one. Even though Parker's ""meaness"" was a bit irratating at first, you quickly understood and there were times where I wanted to skip ahead just to read the chapters of Envy that Parker wrote.So READ this book- you won't regret it and if you want another Sandra Brown pick up Exclusive."
4,Her best yet!,"I have read several of Sandra Brown's books and enjoyed all. This one I loved. Deep down I figured out most of the mystery and then some, but it was great fun along the way. Parker Evans' dialogue and repartee were excellent, Mike was great, Noah was a b.......and Maris was good too. All the players were well defined. The sex wasn't bad either. :) Some of you may be offended; Sandra never holds back. All in all, it was a terrific read, especially in the last few days when we all needed a distraction once in a while to postpone reality! God preserve and protect America!"
4,Back on Track,"One of my first reads was Sandra Brown. I so appreciate her use of persons with disabilities as part of the story - not an add-on.Frankly, her last few works have been weak. But I really enjoyed Envy. As someone who (like millions of others) wants to write the great American novel, the storyline adds the right amount of spice. Hey, tell bookstores and those who inform us of new books that Sandra Brown is not another Joan Collins. If this were true I wouldn't be writing this review"
5,"Envy - Wow, what a book!","I just finished Envy and I have got to say that I think it is the best book I have ever read! I wish I could give it 15 stars! Sandra Brown is one brilliant writer. I have read so many of her books and they are all wonderful, but this one - she has even topped herself - and that's saying a lot.When I first started it, I wasn't sure I liked it. It took me a while to be drawn in. So please whatever you do, don't stop reading it if at first it doesn't seem like your cup of tea. Believe me, you will get so hooked! I simply could not put this book down until I finished it. The rest of my life was simply put on hold! GET IT AND READ IT!!!"
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I picked up this book to read while I was looking for something else I had really been wanting to read. I was very pleasantly surprised. This kept me reading the book through every page and though there was some predictability in the plot, the were several twists that really took me for a loop. I was actually sad the book ended. I have read several others by Sandra Brown such as Ricochet, but this was by far the best I have read of hers."
1,Bummer,"Brown's old books are much better than this drivel. The book is in no way up to the standards of Brown's old paperback romances. The hero is very poorly defined. I couldn't figure out why a supposedly classy lady would like such a jerk. And the villain was too over the top to believe, i.e., the murder of the heroine's father-- such an unnecessary event and out of character for the supposedly sharp witted dad. The whole book was a patchwork of bits and pieces that failed to jell together into a novel. Farfetched and poorly written, I'm glad that I got this one from the library and didn't waste my money on it."
4,Envy...,".... kept me hooked I had some of it figured out by the midsection, but Sandra Brown did a great job of making me guess again, and then change my line of thinking and guess again. A great summer read."
4,Pretty good,"This was a very entertaining book, although it was very predictable I still enjoyed reading it. I gave it 4 out of 5 because of it being so predictable to me, there were a couple little surprises that I didn't see coming though. All in all I would recommend it."
3,"Good, but not her best","I am a big fan of Sandra Brown's mystery suspense books, so I was looking forward to Envy. For the most part the book was very enjoyable. The book within a book format was very well done, and kept me turning the pages to get to the end. Unfortunately I had figured out the entire book long before I got to the last page. The outcome was fairly predictable, although not entirely disappointing. I had a love hate relationship with the Parker Evans character, but found the Noah Reed character too broadly drawn, and Maris just a little too perfect, and seemingly unaffected in being a pawn in two men's games. My major complaint about the book involved the fairly graphic sex scenes. I don't mind sex in books or movies, but these were graphic enough to make me uncomfortable just reading them. I most likely would have graded the book a little higher if not for this factor."
1,What a turkey,"I have a long commute and listen to many audiobooks as a result. My most recent listening experience was ""Envy"" by Sandra Brown. I have to say that when one is able to figure out a plot, including most of the so-called twists, very early on, it's pretty obvious you've got a turkey on your hands. However, to go beyond the plot transparency of ""Envy"" and be more specific: the characters were cardboard archetypes and superficially drawn (Noah is absolutely not to be believed), and the many sex sequences were over-ripe to the point that they were often hilarious. I was literally laughing out loud at times. I enjoy a thrill ride as much as the next person but this was just poorly done formula hokum."
1,not good,"got this book thinking it was a mystery. boring, poorly written, predictable and ridiculous.characters lacked any depth or definition.won't be reading any more sandra brown books!@"
5,Great Fun,I found this book incredibly amusing and suspensful. A friend of mine gave it to me for a birthday present--and it was wonderful. I usually read James Patterson but I found Sandra Brown much more intelligent. This book borders on actual literature. I strong recommend this book.
4,Sandra Brown Is Great!,Even though this isn't my favorite Sandra Brown book it gets points for keeping me guessing. I really like the main characters and the pace of the book kept me going. I'd recommend this book to all Sandra Brown fans.
5,Believe the hype -- it's great!,"I read this book because of the uncommonly high number of 5-star reviews on Amazon. Yes, this was a long book, but the plot twists and turns were great! The characters were very well-developed, complex people who I felt as if I knew intimately. And, although there was some predictability, the suspense leading up to the fait accompli kept the hair standing on the back of my neck! In summary -- most enjoyable!!!"
4,PRETTY DARN GOOD!!!!,"I was pretty disappointed in ""Envy"" when I first started to read it. The first few chapters seemed to drag, save for the installments of Parker's ""book."" But once it got rolling and we were introduced to Maris and Parker's relationship...it all changed. I really enjoyed this book, as I do most of Sandra's books."
2,Envy,"Sandra Brown is an excellent author, she is so good that I always buy her books as soon as they come out. However, I was very disappointed in this book, it did have a good plot but I was turned off by the excess use of profanity and descriptive sex scenes that bordered on being pornographic, they definitely didn't do anything for me except make me skip over some of those pages. When her next book comes out I will take the time to review it before putting down the bucks for a hardback that I have no wish to keep."
3,Don't need all the explicit sex talk.,"I had not read any works by Sandra Brown before, and by recommendation, I thought I would. I was very pleased with her style and character development, but I certainly could have done without the explicit sex talk. While some reference to the matter was essential, a lot more could have been left to the imagination of each reader. I hesitate in recommending it to those whom are offended by such language, but would not disregard it all together. The story was great and the ""good guys always finish last"" gives a good ending to the whole ordeal."
4,"Totally predictable, but fun","I really enjoyed this book, despite the fact that I knew exactly where it was going from the beginning, and was a little disappointed that it was so predictable. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the ride, and the book-within-a-book was a fun twist. I agree with someone else who said the villain is too evil.....I think it would have been a stronger book if he was a little sympathetic. However, this is just what it is, purely entertaining, a page-turner."
3,Envy,I think this could have got a 4 star rating had it been written with more class. The language throughout was deplorable.Writers are suppose to be educated. Educated people should have a better vocabulary.Individuals are aware of expletives and they can be referred to without bringing them out excessively.Truly great writing can be accomplished without the profanity and explicit sex scenes.
5,Another winner,I'm in love w/ just about any SB book. She out did herself again w/ this book. All the characters came to life to me in this book. Big winner. I'm just going to read every sb book. I'm half way there.
5,My Favourite book by SB,"I have read all of Sandra Browns thriller novels and this is by far my favourite, kept me guessing until the end, thrilling and sizzling plot. A difinite page turner in my opinion."
3,slow starter,"It took me a while to get into this book, but then I could not put it down. If you like Sandra Brown, you will enjoy this one. Had a couple of things in it that didn't really jive in the overall plot, but still worth the read."
5,Cycle Riding Reader,"Wow! I just could not put this one down. I read a lot and I read a lot of Sandra Brown. In my opinion, this is her best yet. Although I thought ""The Switch"" was good as well. This one has inspired me to write my very first review. This book ""grabbed"" me early and ""teased"" (on the jacket summary)as to how it would surprise you with its ending. Even though I had pretty accurate ideas as to who was who in Parker's novel ""Envy"", it was never dull and less thrilling to ride and read it out to the finish. Sandra Brown is definately good at combining a thrilling mystery and romance in this one. Keep it up, I'll be there to read them. Sandra Brown is much more than a romance writer. This one is worth the time to read."
5,Envy is the best book I've encountered in a long time!,"I recently listened to (I know it's cheating but I have long car rides to and from work) the unabridged version of Envy and it was fantastic! The other reviews have summed up what the book is about so I won't go into all that again but I wanted to throw another vote into the ""highly recommend"" category!"
2,Unbelievable,"Did any of these reviewers actually read this book! No New York editor is going to `track down' a writer who only submits his initials with a pedestrian at best prologue. Then when she does track down the author, he's so rude, any editor would have consigned him and his novel to the trash. These unbelievable events ruined the rest of the book for me. Did Ms. Brown's own editor think this was a feasible plot devise? I know this was fiction, but was it fantasy too?"
1,Really tiresome and tedious....,"Sandra Brown is an excellent story teller and I usually enjoy her ""mysteries', but I have come to find her writing tiresome. Her vulgarity and crudity gets old after a while. While I know she is trying to make a point that the bad guy is really bad and the good guy is in a lot of emotional pain, there is a way to convey this without all the vulgarity and crudity. I also did not find the magnetism between the man and woman in the past two books she has written that I have found in books written before them. I could of cared less if they ended up together. Quite frankly, I found the book tedious and I rushed through it only to get it over with. This will be the last book I buy of Sandra's unless she can seem to find a way to get the point across without all language."
5,Awesome book...couldn't put it down,"Sandra Brown is my favorite author. Her books are never disappointing. I don't know how she does it. It seems that so many of the big name authors have gone downhill lately.This is one of the best books I have read from this author. My other favorite one is Fat Tuesday. This book is totally entertaining, fast paced, interesting. A total page turner and I highly recommend it !"
1,Sandra Brown should stick to what she does best!!,"In terms of raunchy, soft core sexy novels with a basic plot of boy-meets-girl, girl-hates-boy, sex-sex-sex and happily ever after, Ms. Brown gets my vote anyday. However, whenever she has tried to integrate some sort of mystery into her writing, she falls too far from the mark. ""Envy"" is just as bad as her other mystery endeavors, it is totally unbelievable, weak characters and frankly, there aren't enough sex scenes. I could care less about what happens to the main characters and, by the end of the novel, wished they had all drowned in the first chapter. Like my title says, Ms. Brown should keep churning out such great novels like ""breakfast in bed"" and ""longtime coming"" and, stay away from any forrays into mystery or god forbid, adventure."
5,wonderful,"What a great read! I real page turner for me. A book with in a book will keep you at suspense and falling in love all at once. I highly recommend this book if you enjoy murder, mystery, and romance!"
1,Big disapointment,"I will start out saying that I respect the author for his service and the price he paid serving his countryThat said I cannot give the author more than one star, thats for his service to his country.The book itself er Boooooring beyong belief, we reach page 120 before the author even get to Vietnam, the first 120 pages is spend telling about growing up in small town Ohio and becomming an officer.The rest of the book is filled with details about the auhtors living arangement in vietnam, very little is aboutflying the O-2 FAC in combat.This book was a huge disppointment, had the titel said ""My time becoming a USAF officer and living accomodations in Vietnam during a combat tour"",it would have been a pretty good book, but the titel ""Naked in Da Nang"" and a front cover picture of a O-2 FAC diving while firing rockets suggest a quite different book than than the titel impliesBo HermansenDenmark"
1,Disappointing ...Not much in the way of combat narrative!,"I bought this book on the basis of five-star reviews which implied that this book was going to be loaded with actual combat action. In fact the first 100-plus pages are nothing but stories about growing up in small town Ohio along with anecdotes about Air Force Officer and flight training. When the author finally arrives in Vietnam he devotes entire chapters about his living accomodations, finding a rat on his pillow, etc. The title chapter, Naked in Da Nang has nothing to do with the war. It's about taking a long hot shower in Da Nang during a typhoon - the power goes off, the lights go out, the author gets himself stuck outside, naked, in the storm. The actual stories about flying as an o-2 FAC in Vietnam are few, brief and far between. Don't buy this book unless you are related to the author (you probably wrote one of the rave reviews) or else you went to Tipp City (Ohio) high school with the author."
2,Entertaining but not great,"i don't want to rip on the author. it was a fun story. I suspect there are thousands of pilots out there who have better stories and more interesting experiences than jackson but he is just the guy who actually found a ghost writer to sit down and put his stuff in book form.It just seems like this was mostly about sitting around the camp and complaining about how bad things were when, as the author acknowledges, they had it infinitely better than anybody else in vietnam except for the pencil pushers.If you are interested in Vietnam, there are many, nay more books I would recommend reading before I read this one. Matterhorn is a great recent piece of fiction which is spot on. bright, shining lie is also a great one as is Unfortunate Son.Jackson is a little to self-involved for my taste. He tries to be humble in this book - genuinely tries but ends up failing. Just not a lot here sorry to say."
5,Inspiring new concept,"This book shows new alternatives for quilters and quilt artists! By using beautiful silk flowers and some easy embellishments, Bonnie shows step by step how to achieve some incredible results. The photos of examples are fabulous and instructions clearly written. There are so many designs in the book - I want to try them all!!"
1,AutoCool Review,"While this product was easily installed as advertised, I was very disappointed in the results. While it does help, somewhat, keeping the interior temperature of my vehicle slightly lower in the unbearable heat and humidity that we live with down here in the deep south, it does not peform as I had expected. I believe that I get much better results leaving my windows slightly opened, if no rain is expected, than using this product. I would NOT recommend this product to any of my friends or acquaintances."
3,Killer was too obvious,"Good book for teens. The killer was not who I wanted it to be, it should have been the woman (that's it for my spoiler). To many single men in the book involved with Sydney."
1,should have seen that coming,Description was right on definitely exactly what I neededDescription also said PACK OF 10Definitely not TRUEI received a pack of 2 wall hangersI PAID for 10 wall hangersI want the rest of themI feel I deserve the other 8 wall hangers I paid forSo if you want 10 keyhole wall hangers you should order 5 packs of 10 or purchase them somewhere else where you really get what you pay for
1,Should Be Removed,This item needs to be removed from Amazon. It clearly states package of ten. You only get two. It ends up being five bucks per bracket. Complete rip off.
3,My mom is OK,"Bought this because the My Dad book by the same author is excellent. Little dissapointed but it's still a good book. Guess My Dad by A Brown set the bar too high :) I'd buy it again, though...no regrets."
2,Weak.,"Here we have Komputer's CD for 2007, a weak release. After 10 years from their first album, far more was expected. Some songs lack beat and sound like interludes making the full listening boring.If you want to extend your ELECTROnic precise Kraftwerk-like beats all you need from Komputer is ""The World Of Tomorrow"" (1997)."
2,Not happy,"The product was ordered through Amazon and sold by Adorama. I have purchased a few other seemless backgrounds from Adorama directly, but ordering through Amazon came out with cheaper shipping and handling. I now realize why. This product and the other 2 backgrounds in the same order came damaged with an end on each of them bent over. I do not know where the fault lies for this. Unfortunately, I needed all 3 backgrounds immediately so I was not able to return them but had to unbend and unkink the tube the best I could in order to mount them onto my background holder. All 3 work and are usable since the damage is along the edge and I can keep that out of the frame when I'm shooting. However, this makes me reluctant to order through Amazon again for the same items."
1,Dangerous - DO NOT BUY,"I was very surprised to see my 21 month old pop this outlet cover right off the outlet. We received these as a gift at the baby shower, but now seeing all the poor reviews and from personal experience I will NOT be recommending these to any other parents or parents to be."
1,NOT SAFE!,I walked into my eight-month-old son's room after his nap today to discover he had removed one of these from the outlet near his crib. DO NOT buy them!
1,Horrible & Dangerous,My 22 month old just greeted me with a handful of these outlet covers. Sigh. I am so disappointed by this product. I should have bought the cheaper ones that are really hard to remove. Don't buy.
1,DANGEROUS,Much like everyone else said - these plugs are so easy to remove it is almost laughable. My 10 1/2 month old removes them and chews on them with ease - it doesn't even take effort on her part. So disappointed in this product.
1,Not baby proof,"Like the other reviews, as soon as my baby was mobile these were the first things to get pulled. Then the baby wants to put them back in and thinks that she has learned a new game. Too thick, too much to grab, too easy to get an edge underneath and pry off. Very disappointed, very pleased with smart daughter."
2,Didn't last,By 18 months my son was able to take these off. I think they are too thick and provide too much for him to grab onto.
4,I like them,"I purchased these mainly for the price, because the sliding outlet covers do not work with the many Decora outlets I have in my house. I have found that with a snug fit (it must be flush with the outlet) they are not easy to remove as the other reviewers have described. Furthermore, the color is the same as my outlets, so they blend in and are not obvious. I think that is the reason why my 2 year old son, who is very dextrous, is not interested in removing them and (knock wood) we have not had any problems."
1,Too easily removed by an 8 month old,"I purchased these, thinking that all outlet covers are the same, and I liked the price. However, my 8 month old son can easily slip his tiny pointer finger behind them and pop them out."
3,Worlds dumbest parents,"Some candidates for ""Worst Parents"" here:1)The description lists ""Child-resistant"", not ""Child-proof"".2)Allowing a child to watch a parent install the plug isn't smart.3)Watching the child touch an outlet without immediate parental intervention to stop the child reinforces this dangerous behavior.4)Videotaping the child further reinforces this bad and dangerous behavior.5)The following is printed on our packaging: ""CAUTION: This product is only a deterrent. It is not a substitute for proper adult supervision."" Perhaps these children would receive better supervision at day-care since they obviously aren't getting proper supervision at home.These parents have succeeded in documenting their parental negligence for child services. Hope your children don't get hurt while waiting to be picked up."
1,Awful!! See the video of my 9 month old taking it out!! Sad.....,Length:: 0:57 MinsMy 9 month old taking the outlet plug out....I do not recommend this product!!
1,Not safe at all,"We received these outlet plugs with a grab bag of other Safety 1st products. Unfortunately, these are NOT safe at all. When my daughter was nine-months old she could pull them out of the sockets with relative ease. They are too easy for her to grip and pull out of the socket, so we switched to a different kind that lay almost flush with the outlet covers.(We have an older home with a mix of older electrical sockets and newer electrical sockets, and these did not work as they should for either style.)Edited to add: I had contacted Safety First regarding the ease of removal by young children with these covers and asked if there was something I was missing when installing. Their response was that children develop at different rates, and we need to keep on eye on our child when said child is around the outlet covers. (I'm summarizing)"
1,DO NOT BUY,"Don't buy this product. They seem great at first because they are very convinient and easy to get out, but unfortunately they're a little too easy. A one year old in my care is able to get them out easily, not only defeating the purpose of the plug but also creating a choking. Sure the old fashioned ones are a pain to get out and they ruin your nails... but these are too easy and are very dangerous."
1,Junk,Trust me they figure out how to get them out of the outlets. Get the old fashion one that us parents have a hard time getting out.
1,Useless,These outlet covers are a complete waste of money. They are perfectly designed for little fingers to pull out. My daughter has an easier time pulling these out than my husband and the tab sticks out in a way that makes pulling it out tempting for her. Bare outlets would be safer.
2,Dated information,"Book just arrived and I eagerly started reading only to find the whole book sadly out of date. If you are interested in restoring antiques this might be of some value, otherwise it is not going to be much help. I should have checked the publish date more closely. It would have been a great book in 1993!"
2,Obsolete book,"Obviously an obsolete book,we don't have ""tube TVs"" around for a while...I expected to be ""more on the practical side of the things"",passing some hands on facts,than ""general hints""."
3,"Good, but not completely satisfying","I bought and read this book at a time when I wanted to understand electronics better. I also had an old shortwave radio made with vacuum tubes. I was eager to learn how to keep it and other things working. While I enjoyed reading it and it had some useful ideas, I never really used what I learned from the book on anything. The book will not hurt you and may even help you. How helpful the book ultimately is may depend on your own skills at reasoning out solutions to problems. It will not do that work for you."
3,OK but not great...,This book is just ok but not great by any stretch of the imagination. I was expecting it to go into much more detail than it actually did but it is fine for a beginner. I think you can find better books at the library.
2,For Advanced Users Only,"I was looking for a manual that would take a digital multimeter user from beginner to intermediate user. This book is not what I was looking for.The book does not explain basic electronics concepts or componets, nor does it walk the reader through basic to advanced use of the digital multimeter. Instead, it assumes that the reader has at least a basic understanding of electronic principles and circuits.This is not a good text for the beginning user."
1,How to Test Almost Nothing,"It seems universal that books on electricity, electronics & related testing equipment are targeted for highly-skilled pros.When they say ""for beginners"", they actually mean mid-level."
4,One Great Idea is Worth the Book,My goal is circuit troubleshooting communication gear. There is one terrific idea in this book that is worth far more than what I paid. There is a very simple circuit to use in conjunction with an oscilloscope that proves to be a super way to test components. Buy this book one for that alone.
4,learned a lot,"OK, so I'm new to electronics. But for this not being a reference book, I sure learned a lot. Not just about electronics, but some really useful things. Like how to not blow up caps when you test them. There's a lot of good info here for a novice like me. Well done."
5,"Great book, almost like a technicians notebook!","This book is filled with practical knowledge! Applicable immediately to whatever you are trying to fix. There are a lot of ""quick and dirty"" test circuits to build that will help you diagnose and troubleshoot circuits.Only a few chapters into the book I already see it's potential. I only wish there was an updated version covering some of the newer electronic devices. Very useful to the hobbyist as well!!Cheers!review date 10-21-2010"
3,Less and more,"This book is less than I expected. I wish it had more about multimeters and testing automotive systems. It is also more. It shows how to build certain circuits for use in testing, but I don't think I would use them."
2,Not a buy book,"After reading this! From Front to back. I would rate this in my opition as a not buy! Its a 3rd edition: copy write 1993. This book has not kept up with changes in the eletronics field. Since 1993. It devotes a whole chapter on using a oscilloscope. Which uses the older type scopes. It has a whole chapter. On volt meters. Which is out of date. This field has widen on the type of meters in the market now. The first thing I did notice was the illustration. (No color or B & W pictures) Which, where a little cartoonist looking. It has a chapter on testing TVs. On using the old picture tube with vacuum tubes. On page 194 it shows a illustration on building your own Vaccuum tube tester. If you can find a TV that still uses tubes. It also has a page on 185 on testing Phono Cartridges with a scope. It does talk about IC near the end of the book."
2,Pet Ramp,My 90 pound dog had knee surgery so I needed a way for him to get into my SUV since obviously I couldn't carry him. I was taking him to therapy and to vets. He was so scared of the ramp. I even tried it with my other lab who isn't scared of anything and he wouldn't use it either.It's only good point is that it is fairly easy to transport. But I'm definitely going to return it.
5,nice little unit,I bought two of these units thinking as a gift for an elderly parent it would be nice and I needed something for my workroom. I was realy impressed with the features and the well intergrated sound. Getting a remote for so little is amazing but getting auto reverse on a good sounding tape deck as well as many other features made this one of the best buys I made this year. Mom loves it and so do I. It is not terribly powerful but sounds great. The combination of features as well as portability make this a great little stereo system for travel a kids room or in my case my office.
5,"Splendid Ninth PERIOD, not just among bargains","After listening to this Ninth and comparing it to Karajan's 1963 recording I was shocked to discover that was an improvement over Karajan. The sound quality is totally top-notch, but more importantly Muti conducts the orchestra with such clarity -- the chorus absolutely shines, rather than becoming muddled and obscured by the stings as in the Karajan rendition. Also, if you listen carefully you will notice that Muti uses bass much more effectively than Karajan. Karajan may have the more prestigious reputation, but I have to evaluate what I'm hearing - Muti's 9th assuredly belongs in the upper echelon of 9th recordings. In general Seraphim classics offers quality bargains, but this takes the cake."
4,An enjoyable entry among bargain Beethoven Ninths,"With access to quite a few of Muti's bargain-priced CDs from his Philadelphia years, I thought I should find some of the best to recommend. This Beethoven Ninth stands out for gorgeous playing by the Philadelphia Orch, clear sonics from EMI, and an accomplished, if not at all origianl, interpretation from Muti.We don't have to compare him to Karajan, Furtwangler, and Toscanini--there's no point--but if you like Beethoven to sound generally mellifluous rather than revolutionary, this Ninth is a good choice in the bargain class. Only the opening moments of the first movement and most of the slow movement lack inner tension. In the finale the vocal quartet, though not particularly German, was about the best in the world for pure singing, especially James Morris in his totally secure call to joy. The chorsu is precise but quite aggressively miked, as are the solo quartet."
4,A little slow but passionate and exciting,"The Beethoven 9th is such a great piece of music, that I am always in the market for another recording. My latest is this one with Ricardo Muti and the Philadelphia from the '80's. One look at the timings and you can tell this is not a recording with authentic tempos in mind. Those versions usually clock in at 64 minutes or less. This one takes over 70 minutes. However, the music never drags and the performance has lots of passion. Only the first and third movements are slow. However, the music is never static. As long as there is intensity, slow tempos are totally justifiable in Beethoven 9. As for the soloists, I like the ladies but the men are too heavy handed, especially basso James Morris. The chorus is outstanding. At the budget price, this version is well worth it. Unfortunately, Amazon does not allow for 1/2 points, so I have to give it just 4 stars due to the male soloists. It really is 4 1/2 stars."
5,loved this cd,i found this CD to be very entertaining and enjoyable. hardly do i ever take the chance with an unknown artist but this was a wonderful surprise.. well worth a listen
2,exasperation,"I purchased a Sirius Incanto coffee machine a little more than 1 month ago. I had problem immediately. The first machine snapped and popped then I asked for coffee and it would grind my coffee and discard it to the dreg drawer, dry. Would not make coffee. I spoke to the techie at Cafe West and he agreed that the machine probably needed a new brew group and sent another. I inserted the unit and the machine did the same thing: snap, pop, rattle, discard ground coffee, stop.I called again (it's an expensive item), they sent a different machine and I returned the first unit. OK, works much better. Still a noisy item and has begun a/o today throwing out the ground coffee without making coffee. And although there are plenty of beans in the hopper, won't make coffee unless I add more.Not my best purchase but, when it does cooperate and make me some coffee, it is heavenly."
1,A Nightmare,"I'll begin by stating that when the machine is working it produces terrific ristretto, espresso and americano. The frothing unit also functions well when working. The problem is that it is an unreliable machine that breaks down very frequently. I have had several replacements and some haven't even worked out of the box! This is clearly the least reliable product I have ever owned in any category. I don't understand why the company just doesn't recall them, destroy them and move on to a design that will reflect quality and concern for their customers. My advice is to avoid the Saeco Incanto Sirius at any cost."
2,Breaks down all the time,"Don't buy this one. We bought it when it first came out, and although we do love the coffee it makes, since 2006 it has been broken and sent in for repair at least six times! The last time the authorized service center (Espresso Equipment) in Livermore CA kept it for 6 months, then returned it with a bill for only 1 hour of repair and for parts that were not provided, and within 4 days it stopped working again. The factory won't even take a look at it! Time for something els."
3,Not the best of the Disney animated storybooks,"This program errors continuously on our 2 year old computer, and hitches on our 4 month old computer. Some of the animation and sound effects are redundant. The on-page activities are limited and one of the games isn't very intuitive. My 2 year old son, however, couldn't care a less. He likes it."
2,Peterson Suction Cup Tuner,"The good thing about it is that is very cheap, the bad thing about it isthat is very ""cheap"". I tried putting it on my violin and it doesn't stick,the ""suction"" apparently doesn't work."
1,Not what I remember...,"I guess the production was okay, but there was only one small part that I liked. Too bad I couln't have heard a preview. Boo hoo for me."
5,Beloved Water Music,"This is a beautiful arrangement of Handel's beloved suite. Many brides use movements of this for processionals, recessionals, and seating the family. My used copy was in excellent condition. It's enjoyable classical music for relaxing and entertaining."
3,Somewhat wimpy,"The price is certainly right, but the interpretation is rather lifeless and uninspiring, so, to be truthful, I was a little disappointed."
5,Wonderful & relaxing,I've been wanting this music for my auto for a number of years now. I had it as a cassette tape which broke. I'm fulfilled once again as I listen while driving.
4,"Easy practical read, lots of good advice.","When my supply of new books dries up I like to hit my bookshelves and re-read something I enjoyed in the past. This book was fun to read, the author has lots of colorful verbage and pictures from the past that will make you smile. Or Cringe. Mixed with that is a very powerful message of saving and spending your hard earned dollars. If you are new to finance and don't want to wade through a textbook type explanation of financial matters this book would be a sound choice. It contains information on spending wisely, mutual funds, options and insurance in just enough detail to get you started. I would supplement this purchase with ""The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need"" by Andrew Tobias for a great jumpstart on finance."
5,High-larious,"Greed is Good is a whiz bang, whack-em, sack-em ride through the financial maze. It's better than Ricky Martin. It's better than The Great Space Coaster. Greed is Good is funny and fun; it goes down like a Slurpee...no spoon-straw needed."
2,I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS BOOK WAS PUBLISHED !,"Apparently this book was sent to the printing press without the publisher, Harper Collins, actually reading it. It is loaded with typographical and factual mistakes. I have never read a book containing so many mistakes. Here are four examples. There are many others. 1.) Page 120, ' Woman who can talk money are even more attractive than those who can talk sports.' It should be, ' Women who can talk money..."" 2.) Page 190, Hoenig misspells the name of CNBC anchorman Bill Griffeth. Hoenig spells it Griffith. 3.) Page 200, Hoenig says Corey Feldman was in the movie 'Licensed to Drive'. The name of the movie was 'License to Drive.' 4.) Page 58, Hoenig actually claims you can invest $100 a year at 11% per year and have $867,996 after 40 years. This is nonsense. These are just four examples. You will find many more if you waste your money on this book"
4,Very good tight,Used this tight for my daughter's iceskating show and it kept her warm nicely.Very good tight.
5,Great Product,I bought these tights for my granddaughter. They definitely helped keep her warm for her first competition. Seems made very well and fit perfectly.
2,snags galore,This material snags more easily than I ever would have imagined. For the price I would have much expected better.
2,Where is the diversity?,"I bought this book because I like to draw and children are one of my favorite subjects to draw. I was hoping for more variety in poses and expected a multi ethnic display of pics. I was disappointed by the lack of photos of children of other races, only two small pics of Black children and NO Latinos, Asian children included, even the white children that comprise the vast majority were 80% blonde and blue eyed, pretty insulting imo. Alot of the pics were sticky sweet and overly angelic/sentimental."
2,Too technical for a new mom gift.,"I like to give new moms a book on how to photograph their children. I've purchased several different books covering this topic, this is the first one I'm not happy with. This book is far too technical for the use I need. There are much better options out there."
5,Helps you get the perfect picture!,"Have a child at home? Once you read through this book you'll find yourself saying ""Of course - how intuitive!"" Suggestions are presented clearly and with photos to help you maximize good pictures for the fussy kid. A must have for every parent."
3,almost as good as Guyton,"I used this book for an undergraduate renal/endocrine physiology class. For this material, it was excellent, but I still found myself referring back to my Guyton text fairly often. For comprehensive coverage of systems physiology, I would suggest Guyton.In addition, I think we got one of the first printings of this book a few years ago, and the binding everyone's book fell apart completely after only three months of use. I hope they've solved that problem."
3,My eyes!,"I'm sure this book is excellent in hardback, but the paperback print is just too small. And my eyes are only 32 years old! I returned the book."
4,Humour and Revolt,"Casca gets involved in the Boxer rebellion in China in 1899-1900 and fights on the Chinese side against the imperialist British oppressors. Well, that's the condensed version, but I found it by far the most hilarious of the Casca stories (the parade ground scene with the corpse on the flagpole and the bandit raid on the Chinese village being two scenes which had me in stitches) and if you can ignore the blatant anti-British bias that screams out at you this is an enjoyable yarn of Casca acting as a British undercover spy and ending up fighting against them. The Chinese water torture scene is very well done, too."
3,Fabio??,"The story had some good parts, but the one thing that makes me want to puke is the friggin cover. Fabio? With not one scar? Man, this is just plain misleading. Casca is not some pretty boy, and even in #1 when he had very few scars...he still had scars. I have no idea whom the target audience was when this cover was done. Jeeez!"
2,Cursed to be the worst...,"I remember this one to be one of the most boring and unbalanced novel of poor 'ol Barry Sadler's. Was he writing them just to collect a paycheck here in this time frame...? Running out of story ideas? We'll never know.I was hoping for something along the lines, and up to par to his past Asian adventure, Book #4: Casca the warlord. Samurai's and ninja's is what Casca should have been fighting with in these novels. But it wasn't meant to be..."
2,Disappointed......,"The reason that I purchased this Universal Concentrator was because my current blow dryer or hair dryer (whatever you call it!), concentrator went missing. I became excited about getting this universal concentrator because I couldnt seem to find the concentrator for my type of hairdryer....I asked around about any universal concentrators and was pointed to this direction.I waited anxiously for my product to get home, and once it did I was happy to find that it did fit my hairdryer! After a couple uses (like 3 times) though I found that when I would try to straighten my hair with this concentrator attached, it would pop off and hit me on the head...With that being said I cant even put the concentrator on my hairdryer anymore because it wont stay on. I understand that its not a miracle worker, but I at least expected this to last me more than a month."
1,Don't waste your money,Don't even waste your money! As soon as you turn on your hair dryer the nozzle flies right off. I even tried to duct tape it to my hair dryer and it still came off.
5,Meet expectations!!,HairArt Universal Concentrator fits perfectly to my blowdryer and the airflow is more powerful than the concentrator that comes with it.
4,the kids can lay down the rock!,"i can't believe this album was recorded on a 4track!...it sounds like a lenny kravitz record. very full flavored clean, punchy rock recording. these guys must be experts on the seventies rock idiom...they really know how to do it. i think their sound is somewhere between the black crowes and the poppier side of the allman brothers. very seventies...this album can be strummy and sing-songy at times, and super heavy (as in ""she's so....."") in other moments. the singer is a bit overly emotive at times....but i think for the most part this is a great album to have for a road trip...if you know what i mean"
2,Slow Hands,I read the first 100 pages then jumped to the last 100 pages because the middle was boring. If you like a book that keeps you reading because it's intresting I would not recommend this.
4,Great item!-second time around,"I first purchased this product-then had to send it back to the seller because the sub wouldn't sink! The second sub I got today was GREAT! It sank, it's pretty easy to control-and it's a fun toy to use. If you're getting this product-I would just like to say that DVD Earth was very prompt in sending it. It was almost the very next day! Thanks! I definitely recommend this to you!"
2,Fun Toy,"This was a great toy. I would drive it around the fish tank, pretty easy to control and lasted 5-10 minutes on a charge.Unfortunately something happened with my charging base after about 20-30 uses (few months), and it stopped working. Not sure what happened."
1,Didn't work for me,"I'm a party decorator and was looking for a white masking tape that would temporarily tape light paper decorations to the wall/ceiling without damaging the paintwork. I usually use Scotch Masking Tape and that works great but this time I needed something white. Anyway, I tested it by taping up a hanging foil swirl (very lightweight) to the ceiling. Unfortunately, it fell down within a few hours, so not suitable for this purpose. Still looking for a white masking tape as good as the Scotch beige one...!"
3,Not great adhesive,"While the color vibrancy is excellent on this product, the adhesive is not real strong. It tends to start peeling soon after applying. If you want this for removable tape, it'll work well for you."
4,"Offbeat, Optimistic Modern Adventures in the Tokyo Slums","The most accessible film of director Satoshi Kon's all-too-brief anime career. Where Perfect Blue and Paprika are more adventurous and challenging, they're also difficult to sit back and enjoy in a traditional sense without falling into a deep state of analysis. This one, of three bickering homeless chums who find an infant girl in the garbage, retains the quirks, charms and emotional punch of Kon's other works without challenging quite so many conventions. Sweet, funny and grounded, it's constantly flashing a dry wit and, although it often tugs at the heart strings, things never get overly soft or weepy. The trio of leads are diverse and interesting, each with an onion skin of personal history to explore, and their hunt for the child's parents amidst the overpopulation of a major world metropolis constantly jolts out in surprising new directions. Beautifully written, drawn and animated, it can also be a bit static and randomly fortuitous."
5,Terrific Anime Film,"The only thing that bothers me about this film is that it is sub-titled in English instead of dubbed in English. Anime purists will tell you that subtitles are the only proper way to view anime, but I dislike hobbies with ""have to"" rules and I prefer well-performed dubbing (which is not so unusual these days). This film, either version, is a charming story about three homeless men who discover an abandoned child at Christmas time. Sound like ""Three Men and a Baby"" to you? Yeah, me too. But don't let that stop you from enjoying the unique take on the storyline and the beautifully presented artwork. It's a film for teens or older but is totally appropriate with a tender meaning. Characters are well-drawn and well-drawn (if you know what I mean). A keeper in your anime collection. More so, if you're a fan of Satoshi Kon's work."
5,Not Your Average Christmas Story,This is a brilliant take on 'Three Godfathers.' It is twisted and touching and a great introduction to Japanese animated film.
3,Excellent story!,True to the homeless with the cussing but a little too much for my taste. Excellent story! I have spent time among the homeless they do have codes they go by and yes they will cuss (not all).
3,Classic modern Christmas Movie,"Satoshi Kon's third movie is about a homeless bum, transvestite and runaway finding an abandoned baby on Christmas Eve as they attempt to search for the baby's parents (in order to give them a piece of their mind). As the other reviews say, it's a really uplifting story about the spirit of Christmas, forgiveness, and destiny.Unlike Kon's other two movies (PERFECT BLUE, MILLENNIUM ACTRESS) , this one is primarily a comedy and has a lot of funny moments and will get you shedding a tear or two. I didn't think this movie was as strong as his other two, but it's definitely a tearjerker if you watch it during the Holiday Season."
3,Quick Overview,"The lives of three homeless people are plunged into chaos when they find an abandoned baby on new-year's eve. Do they keep it or do they start an impossible search for the parents in snowbound Tokyo?Diverting, but felt like it was not explored as fully as it could have been. The characters are definitely fascinating, but seem to lack something in depth."
4,Good funny anime,"I catched this on Starz the other day, this was a funny anime.A baby thats kidnapped gets dumped and is found by a homeless gay couple. One man names the baby Kiyoto after his daughter.By a strange twist, he meetshis long lost daughter, though the homeless man left his family and from then were heard treated to one bizarre scene after another.The couple realized the baby is still lost and try to find the real mother, a woman claming to be the mother takes the baby, but the gay couple realize she is a fake and hunt her down.Dont want to give anymore info except this is one funny anime."
2,Disappointing Quality,"These Pendaflex Extra Capacity Hanging Expansion Folders, model number 04152X1, are disappointing.As years go by the quality erodes for many products. Things are designed wear out as soon as feasible. Pendaflex folders used to be very nice quality. This current generation of Pendaflex appear to be made by the lowest Chinese bidder.The old Pendaflex folders were sturdier and had a better quality of paper. The metal hangers were a stronger gauge.The pressboard bottom needs to be installed by the user in a cut-out at the bottom, a really junky construction. One should expect a built-in reinforced bottom.There is no info-pocketOffice Depot no longer offers Pendaflex. The Office Depot store brand is even shoddier quality. I guess the Office Depot low price for junk has pressured Pendaflex to lower its price and the quality in order to compete.On the other hand, it does not appear that anyone else now makes a better quality product."
4,"Good overall quality, but insert for bottom is an issue","The only concern is the insert for the bottom, to keep it open. I would like to have a more sturdy way to assure the desired structure."
2,wish it was better,"Okay. So i really wanted this book to be good. I am really interested in women in mythology. The basic problems with this book is that it contains almost no real information. The book is tripple spaced and is really just full of stories heard second hand. I was hoping it would be more factual, giving info about more women. However it just gave stories about certain women, if you are interested in that just seach for a good website like paleothea.com. If you want facts, info, or good writing look elsewhere. I really hope that someone else writes a book about this topic because i find it incredibly interesting. However i will give the book two thumbs up on its images. the beautiful color photos of art work are really nice illustrations."
3,Cant wait for audiobook release...,"Starring the voices of : Crispian Belfrage ( Liz & Dick),Denice Duff (NOTLD 3D).This audiobook was different in a good way,The lead role has a filmic quality that would lead itself nicely.thedevilwithwingsaudiobookTheir is alot of war plane action heard and near death instances where escape seems impossible.Exotic war events against Japan and treasures to be had by victor.So,The costume of THE DEVIL WITH WINGS is all black,aviator hood with oval eye lenses( Which isnt removed thru 85 % of story),black gauntlets,black high boots--Sound familiar ? (cough) DARK KNIGHT RISES ???"
4,you can def feel a little jolt of energy,"these multivitamins will give a user a small energy boost (From ginseng that's in it), otherwise it contains all the vitamins from A to Z"
5,I love it,"I've taken this product for two years and I love it. For those of you who work out, it's perfect for you. I take it with a protein shake or all fruit breakfast. If it's causing some people an upset stomach they may want to consider their diet and the time of day they take it. Also, ginseng is spicy and ginko may not agree with everyone. I love the product."
2,Stomach ache,"We bought large size bottle of ""Centrum Performance"" from BJ's. When I first realize that its causing this annoying stomach ache.... I told my wife... and after long time we agreed on something.... this product is definately more likely to cause stomach ache then Centrum... which I have used before without any problem."
5,It works.,"At first, these gave me a stomach ache for 5-10 min, but after a few days, I do not get them anymore, thank God. Plain and simple, these work. These are the only vitamins I've ever tried or used, so I cannot judge them relative to others. But, I do feel more energy in the morning (I am not a morning person at all) and it lasts well into the evening. I feel a noticeable difference during and after workouts, too. I do not get as tired, and I feel great all day. Highly recommended for those who have an active lifestyle, although I will probably try the GNC Mega Men multivitamins at some point."
2,Vitamins to Expire in 3 Months...,"I bought vitamins and received them timely, but the expiration date on these vitamins are 02-2012 (I bought these vitamins 10-2011). Highly dissatisfied. I looked at my old vitamins I bought a year ago and even they had an expiration date of 02-2013, which is later than the vitamins I received from you."
1,received vitamin on 12/12/11 ..it expire on 2/2012,this mean i have to take this vitamin and finish it in 2 months. Not very good. my old vitamin bottle have 2013 expiration date.
1,Causes upset stomach,"all of a sudden, I noticed I was getting upset stomachs about once a day that would last about 30 mins. I finally realized, it was within about 5-10 mins after taking this. After that I confirmed it--this causes relatively severe upset stomach for me (and apparently many others, based on the web). And I wouldn't consider myself someone with an easily upset stomach by any means."
3,Have they changed ingredients,"The last time i purchased these vitamins i felt a surge of energy.. now they just make me sleepy. I don't think i'll be buying them again. Perhaps its just me, everyones body is different. By the way if anyone is looking to lose weight and wants to do it naturally try this, it made me lose 10 pounds."
2,Good Product BUT,"I believe in the product. Glad that Amazon has it as it's hard to find in retail. Thing is, expiration date is too soon - 4 months. They should have some kind of policy when shipping consumables with expiry dates. I could have returned it, but I find returning products such a hassle. I will think twice about buying consumables with Amazaon if no policy on expiration dates is set."
1,Expiration date missing,Beware!!! Expiration date is missing! The sticker was ripped out.. I am pretty sure they are selling expired vitamins! Coz why else do they take out expiration dates??? It's a waste!
3,"Selling vitamins with a ""December, 2012"" expiration date in December, 2012?","Selling vitamins with a ""December, 2012"" expiration date in December, 2012? I should have known that for a price of $1.99 for a 60-count bottle that ""something might be amiss"", but still. You would think that a seller might want to mention that the reason for the cheaper pricing was due to the fact that they were set to expire during the same month that they were being sold. As a result, I might have chosen to purchase just 1 bottle instead of 3..."
1,DISCOUNTINUED,This product is DISCOUNTINUED. There is a reason a lot of people here are not seeing expiration dates. Centrum stopped making this product a good while ago. I would recommend looking on their website for their newest or up to date multivitamin types.
1,upset stomach,"you guys are right, now i know why my stomach been upset. i just started taking these again. today i only took half of the pill after i read the comments and my stomach goes kinda bad within 5 minutes. before i never knew cuz i always take it when i eat once a day. you may get stomach cramps and get the feeling that you feel like throwing up."
5,Mr. Corks Totally Off The Wall Christmas,Hilarious and 'totally off the wall'.One of the funniest cd's I've ever listened to.Buy it. It's well worth the price.
4,Good book,"I love Elizabeth George but this was my least favorite. I found A Woman After God's Own Heart and A Mother After God's Own Heart much more in depth. There is some overlap in A Woman After God's Own Heart. However, it is still a great read with really great information."
2,Not Such Good Advice,"Some of it is good, and certainly I want to be a wife after God's heart. But overall, . . . no. Tried it, rejected it, much happier now."
5,Excellent,Very well written - convicting - excellent practical ideas for loving others. Reminder - marriage does include sacrifice. Bible reminds us to deny ourselves & pick up our cross - it isn't all about us. If we can't love our mate - how in the world can we love God.
1,Find a better book,"I had heard good things about George, so I though I'd give her book a try, but I could barely make it past the third chapter. I felt like I was reading the Complete Idiot's Guide to an Unrealistic, Cheesy Marriage. I found her tone condescending as I, the reader, was first called her ""precious reading friend"" and then was accused of having a ""sometimes empty brain."" And to give my husband a really fabulous day, she suggested I not talk at all the whole day...yes, she really said that. No thanks. There are a lot of other choices out there for books on biblical marriage. I think I'll keep on shopping."
3,"Read ""Power of a Praying Wife"" instead","I have read a few books on being the wife God intended me to be. I haven't regreted it for a second either. The problem with this book was I read it after reading ""The Power of a Praying Wife"" so it was a let down after such a great book. Don't get me wrong, this is a good book but I like the way the other author states things better. Just an opinion. If you have read the other book I mentioned then you really don't need to go through this one too."
5,"Altama Black 8"" Boot","Great boot. Took only a few days to brake in. Boots are comfortable, have good support, and the running chassis makes a big difference. Like walking with tennis shoes on!"
2,Version for left-handed or can you switch the stylus side?,"My daughter, who is left-handed, said it was very difficult to write with this as the cord and stylus are on the right hand side and the cord isn't long enough. I'm hoping there is a way to fix this?"
2,FED UP,"I went crazy looking for this toy this Christmas, and after finding it and paying $10.00 more for it....I CAN'T FIND THE EXTRA CARTIDGES TO IT ANYWHERE!! What is up with this toy?My children are already bored with it because they know that the cartidges exists from the commercials. I give up."
3,Frustrated,"I went crazy looking for this toy at Christmas. I finally found it and when my daughter who's five opened it the first thing she said was, "" Where are the other games?"". She meant the software cartidges which she saw on the commercials but were no where to be found in the stores. I am still looking for these cartidges and don't understand why they are so dificult to find."
3,Iam not happy with the toy!!,"About a month of my daughter playing with it the screen has a one inch section in it that doesn't work. I tried reseting the screen like you do when you first get it. I do not recomend this item. I am very unhappy about the short life, for the ... price."
2,be warned,"ordered this t-shirt as a gift for someone... appears that it would come in white to me. The fact is that the combi doesnt guarantee color, and just sends out random ones... i was mailed a bright red t-shirt which unfortunately isnt going to workout. be warned. i called the company and they were apologetic, but nothing they can do.. if i take the time to return it, i will follow-up with commentary on how that goes"
3,No separate piano parts,"I bought the book and thought to have both violin and piano parts on separate sheet. Unfortunately, the violin sonatas are printed in form of score containing both violin and piano. I have to copy the score for my piano accompaniment. Other than that the Fugue and Patitas are great. Overall this book is good for personal collection and I can never stop playing them."
5,new edition of the NHoC,"The New Harp of Columbia is the seven-note ""old harp"" tune book for shape note singers in and around Knoxville in east Tennessee. The 1975 University of Tennessee Press reprinting is probably out of print (though we have a few extra copies) as of March 2001. A new edition, scheduled for publication by the University of Tennessee Press in July 2001, will include the present (1867) New Harp of Columbia, with about 40 additional tunes from the earlier (1848) Harp of Columbia which M.L. Swan omitted from the new book in 1867. Meanwhile, come sing with us! - Bob Richmond (RSRICHMOND@aol.com)"
4,Puckish,"While I am tempted to agree with the facts of the preceding negative reviews, I believe they've missed the point of the book. It's not meant to be a ""narrative around life in this secretive country""; it's meant to be a collection of images that allude to the fantastical narrative of official DPRK propaganda - to ""portray the country as it wishes to appear"", as the author says in his afterword.So yes, while the photographs are not of the quality of, e.g., Harris's Inside North Korea (and are in fact occasionally taken from television sets), they are intentionally of this quality, and this book is far more educational and entertaining for it.And can anyone tell me what the woman on pp 20-21 holding her jacket open while facing a hotel clerk is doing it for? Maybe the book should be PG-14..."
1,Very Dissapointing,"I've never seen a photography book this weak. Typical vacation pictures are much better (I'm not exaggerating). Don't take my word for it, buy the book and see. I didn't listen to the review titled ""Paradise Lost"" (which was dead on) and I wasted $35."
4,Great touch of Chirstmas cheer,"I bought these for the holidays. They are really fun earrings. The red is nice and bright, and I got a lot of complements while wearing them. They are large, but lightweight, and comfortable to wear all day-I even forgot I was wearing them at times. They are fragile, but came in nice, clear, hard plastic box. This kept them protected during shipping, and comes in handy for storing them safely when they are not being worn."
5,family variety,"The grandchildren love these videos; they provide facts with funny little cartoon characters. Henry, the gecko host, makes the adventures charming. This series provides an excellent introduction to animals; very entertaining for little ones.Amazing Animals: Seashore Animal [VHS]"
5,Great Drum,I purchased 2 drums as gifts. My friends and I have created a drum circle. These drums look and sound great.
1,never got it,"I don't know how the game was because I never got the game, been waiting over 3 months. I would love to have tried the game"
4,My Review,"When I received these pajamas, I found the top was a little snug although I ordered Size XL. I wish the top was a little more expansive because I move around quite a lot during the night. Other than this, everything was good."
5,Stellar in every way!,"Everything from the production value of the DVD to the fights themselves are simply top-notch! This is one of those seemingly rare events where not only is the fight card stacked with unbelievable matchups, but the fights themselves live up to the hype... and them some. Simply put, this DVD is packed with some of the best fights I have seen in quite a long time. I highly recommend this event not only to the hardcore MMA fan, but to the newcomers just beginning to enjoy the sport. This is a great example of what makes Mixed Martial Arts so exciting!!"
3,A bit of misrepresentation,"Volumes two and three of Bruce Wayne Fugitive can both be accused of misrepresentation. The first half of #2 basically has nothing to do with the main ongoing story and is more a continuation of Greg Rucka's previous Evolution storyline. Then the Bruce Wayne saga essentially ends with this volume, and yet there is one more, with its contents being more accurately described as an epilogue than an intrinsic part of the story, combined with a few more unrelated single issues. While bits and pieces of both are important, this practice of deception is certainly disappointing and somewhat dishonorable. The last two volumes could have and should have been edited and subsequently collected into one larger book. I may not have picked up the last one if I had known more about its exact contents. Shame on you, DC."
3,Read it for the story arc,"Bruce Wayne: Murdered and Fugitive series is a good story arc. Nothing exceptional either in the story or the art. For some reason though, I do like the interaction of the other characters with Batman as the question his innocence.I do recommend it. I have read it a couple of times, so it is good enough to read more than once."
1,I lost interest,"This is the third volume of Fugitive? That story was more or less wrapped up in volume 2. So there seems to be some loose ends such as saying goodbye to his bodyguard, now released from prison and working for Checkmate and some episodic stories here and there.Batman fans here are just too kind with their rating. Why are DC artworks so inferior when compared to Marvel?"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"David Cain, the man that almost framed Batman for murder, and Batgirl's father, has important testimony to deliver. There are those that do not want him to do so, and have hired Deadshot to kill him.Batman has two problems, he has to protect Cain, and he has to find a way to get Cain to actually want to live."
4,Curing With Cayenne,"Loved the info in the book. I have some questions about the author though. He takes personal credit where he should not - after all, he is the reporter, not the one with knowledge."
2,Rolling pins with handles are soooo much easier,"I kind of regret this purchase. I bought it when I was taking a Wilton cake class but I wish I hadn't bought it because my wooden rolling pin works just as good (teacher advised us not to use wooden rolling pins because it wouldn't come out smooth, BUT for large pieces of fondant meant to cover a cake you use the side on the bottom). I would advise just trying out using your wooden rolling pin OR buy one of the other Wilton rolling pins that has handles. Not having handles is reeeeaally hard on your hands. However, the small rolling pin that Wilton sells for rolling smaller pieces is something I would recommend."
3,BEWARE the shipper - always opened packages,Like the other reviewer my Wilton package was cracked and opened and had been put inside another plastic bag. Not a shipping problem! The rolling pin itself was damaged with marks and indentations on it which makes it unusable for rolling smooth fondant. Whoever packaged the item was well aware they were sending me something that had been opened and damaged. The amazon packaging was fine. I am returning it for another one. I am hoping that they will have to send me a new one while my used/damaged one is being routed back to them.Followup: I received another one while mine was on the way back. The 2nd one arrived in Wilton packaged that was also cracked open at both ends and split along the entire side. This time the roller had only a blemish or 2 so I smoothed it out and will keep it. I should have just made a trip to Michaels!
2,Bent with little use,"I was quite pleased with this rolling pin the first few times I used it (didn't have any of the packaging products others seem to have had), but I went to make a wedding cake two weeks ago and realized it was really significantly curved, like a parenthesis, making it not so good at rolling out a consistent thickness. It has not been heated or stored under pressure, so I have no idea what could have bent it, but I'm pretty disappointed!"
2,Meh,Got this to use in a cake decorating course. needless to say I'm not impressed. Since you need to use shortening to keep your gum paste/fondant from sticking all it did was make my pin greasy and hard to work with. I'll stick with the wood or silicone based ones.
3,Average book - pay close attention while reading,"This is a beginner's book, not a reference. It is elaborate so it must be read with a good amount of concentration. If you don't read between the lines, you might miss some good points."
2,Not a good book for someone new to ASP!!,"More lost then when I started reading. The code examples do not work without some tweaking. The assumed familiarity with the .NET framework is frustrating. This was very disappointing. I really needed to gain some quick knowledge, and it is not going to happen here!!"
1,Lousy sink-too difficult to clean,Every water spot shows on this sink when it dries. I have had stainless steel previously and never had a problem. This sink is almost impossible to keep clean. AWFUL!
1,Quality is awful.,"I looks great and I love the design, but the quality isn't quite what I though it should be. I choose the Kohler over the others for its heavier gauge steel. The price point jump to the really heavy stuff was more than I could afford. So far in one week with very gentle use I have made a small ding from a pot that dropped just and inch off the bottom and two scratches on the top of the sink that I can't explain. These were not copper pots, rather lightweight egg pans. I just purchased the bottom covers for protection, but those are a pain because you must pick them up and clean under them due to food getting stuck. I wish I would have saved up the extra money on the heavier gauge steel models. Now I worry every time I wash dishes.Update: I really don't recommend this at all now. After a few months of gentle use, it looks like my last sink did after 20 plus years of use with all the scratches and dings. This is obviously a very cheap grade of ss."
4,installation can be tricky,"Great sink, very sturdy 18 gauge stainless. Can fit a 9x13 pan in the larger basin to soak! That was the main reason I purchased it. The price was almost half the cost of buying it directly from Kohler. I am still trying to figure out how to TIGHTEN THE NUTS DOWN ON THE MOUNTING CLIPS ON THE FRONT EDGE since there is LITTLE ROOM for getting a tool up between the front of my cabinet and the bowl of the sink, about 2 1/2"" clearance between the two. Kohler's mounting design would have been MUCH easier for this drop in sink if they had used a clip system with screws instead of nuts. A screwdriver would fit nicely into the tight space. ONCE I GET THE SINK IN, I WILL LOVE IT!"
1,POS,"First, the reason I bought this sink was because it was easy to install and I done it myself (first time). Forget the clips! I have granite so I used some hardcore clear silicone and it feels as if I placed it in cement. But let me tell you, this sink is crap. After one week of use it has ton of scratches all over the bottom from spoons and forks. It is crazy. I moved from an apartment and I am pretty sure the sink there was a cheap sink but it hell didn't scratch. I am telling you do not buy this POS you will regret it. I have stainless steel appliances and everything looks nice except the sink. I can't replace it because I am out of money after doing a lot of upgrades to the house but this sink will be out of there as soon as I have some money to spare. Look elsewhere. I am surprised with the high reviews on Amazon. Check Lowes for more accurate reviews."
1,look elsewhere for true erotica,I thought I was getting something similar to Penthouse Forum - this is artsy plays with little to no erotic stimulation.
2,Wrong color - Received Brown color,"I bought the chimes as an add-on piece to my drumset, but when I received this item the color was BROWN. Other than the difference in color, the chimes are built sturdy, quite durable, and sound fantastic."
4,Great Toy!!,My son is 17 months and he loves it!!!!! He plays with it at least once every day. I'm will be buying another bigger maze for Christmas.
4,Mesmerizing,"A Christmas gift for 2 granddaughters, ages 3 and 1. They never tire of placing the beads just so. Gives Mom a break when needing to reorganize their play area. Great for teaching colors and counting. A tad pricey but worth it. Made the shopping experience easy, especially with free shipping."
2,Overpriced,"When I bought this toy, I payed around $40. I really think that this is way too much for what it offers.First, it's not really that big. My daughter is under 2 years old, and she has hard time tracking the beads through hard to reach places of this toy. I think that the wires are too tight in some places thus restricting access of little hands. Overall it's not very exciting. The bids are a little difficult to move around for a smaller child. Perhaps my daughter is just too young for this toy, and I'll keep on trying to encourage her to play with it. However, I do not recommend it at the price I bought it for."
4,Kids love it - tracks could be more spaced out,My son loves to play with this toy daily. He does get a little frustrated when he cannot move the beads they way he wants but he figures it out. The orange track gets a little tight even for their little hands but eventually its managed. Also he attempted to sit on the bead maze and the wires bent. It took a little muscle power to unbend but it worked out. It would be better if the tracks weren't so close together. If I were to buy another one I would inspect to see how close the tracks were so their hands can move the beads about better.
1,Great show. Poor player app,"I really enjoy the mentalist but the amazon instant video app continues to unexpectedly shut down. The app has a pop up when I reopen that says ""instant video unexpectedly quit, would you like to send an anonymous report so we can fix the problem?"" I've already sent over 10 anonymous reports but I really would like to watch the show I purchased from amazon. Additionally, the app will not interface with Apple TV, maligning it so I cannot watch the show on my tv when I am home."
2,menu is mental,"Hi,Like anyone reading this review I really enjoy ""The Mentalist."" The show is exciting and humorous. Plus the character of Patrick Jane has a legendary smirk.My issue is the main menu screen. There are no options. No choice of episode selection. No settings. Nothing. You have to play all the episodes. If you are looking for a specific episode you must fast forward to find them. It is really strange and frustrating.It seems rather ironic to me that a show based on mental acuity can't seem to make a normal menu screen. That is a bit mental.If you can get past that, the episodes are great."
5,I'm Addicted,Somehow I can't get enough of The Mentalist so I had to go back and watch the first one again. I was even willing to PAY for it............I'm a sick puppy. LOL
4,a need for more veiwing,I love the time I get to watch the Mentalist. amazon has help me get all four seasons. I just happen to catch an episode on cable that Amanda Rightti was added half way through and Simon Bakerwas only a guest. I didn't see that on my first season. Help find out if I missed alot.
1,Complete rip-off of a great show!,"This show is just Psych - minus the witty writing, the great acting, the intriguing characters and the quality and style that characterizes the original. Unbelieveable this made a second season. Watch the original instead - it's way better."
2,Poca imaginación,"Los amantes de las series de suspenso, sean de investigación privada o policial, esperan sorpresas, caminos nuevos y que la tensión en cada capítulo vaya subiendo se acuerdo a la conocida secuencia de ""hilo, nudo y desenlace"". En mi opinión, The Mentalist (1ra. Temporada) carece de ello. Incluso si uno la considerara dentro del género intermedio de la ""comedia policial"" (en el que se encuentra, por ejemplo, Bones), se la siente insípida y carente de imaginación.Cuando pienso en un mentalista lo asocio de inmediato a un ilusionista, al estilo del personaje de Harlequin, aquella maravillosa película inglesa con Robert Powell, Carmen Duncan, David Hemmings y Broderick Crawford, y siento que The Mentalist se encuentra a ""años luz"" de ella. Para mí, no vale la pena."
1,A blatant rip off of USA's Psych,"If you like sloppy seconds, this is the show for you. Otherwise, may I suggest you check out USA's Psych. The incredibly well written basis for this counterfeit."
5,good,bought these for my husband for Christmas he loves the mentalist but can never stay awake long enough to see the ending of them on tv so that is why i got these
4,WHAT A SURPRISE!,"There's nothing as great as discovering a new television series and finding out how unique it is! The Mentalist is one such show. Having heard about it on tv ads, I decided to borrow Season One from the local DVD store and see for myself what this show was all about. It's a bit quirky, a bit black comedy, but alot of fun. Simon Baker is perfect in the role of Patrick Jane, a pseudo-psychic who is always a few steps ahead of everyone else. His character is witty, intelligent, and a bit arrogant at times. I can't wait for Season Two...."
4,"Skeptic turned fan...""The Mentalist""",I never watched the show on major network and took a gamble on Season 1 because I ran out of good shows to watch. It frankly surprised me.The show is relatively low budget and sort of silly if you live in California since you really can't just hop in your car and drive from Sacramento to Oakland withall the crime scene first responders still milling around. The edgy character Simon Baker plays is quite charming and the scripts are pretty good.I have already ordered Season 2 and 3. Hope I won't be disappointed.
4,The Mentalist: The first Season,We loved the packaging and the DVDs. The case came with the interior pegs that hold the DVDs to the case broken so when we open the case the DVDs fall out. Shipping problem?? But the Mentalist was great.
2,Love the show don't like the purchase.,I assumed that the pilot would be the show where Baker started out as Jane. That doesn't seem to be the case. I am not able to get the videos to work on my computer. Maybe when I use the dvd player it will work better. I love the show and wanted to see more episodes. So far I haven't.
4,An interesting show,"Very entertaining. As long as you can believe the premise of a police ""consultant"", watching Jane do his thing is lots of fun. The episodes are well thought out and fun to watch."
1,"One more time, with feeling!","I travel for a living and have to go to Detroit quite a bit. People often groan when I tell them that but I have learned that Detroit and its surrounding areas have a lot to offer! I was disappointed with this book because of its colorless, soulless treatment of a very dynamic place. It reads more like a term paper than a travel guide. I have read guides to Michigan by seasoned writers who treated the subject matter with the heart and excitement it deserves. I would definitely pass this one up and keep shopping."
3,"good, not my favorite","Food tastes are definitely subjective. Wouldn't buy these again, but that is just my personal taste preference. I love the black sesame rice snaps from the same company. These Tamari Seaweed I dip in hummus to augment the flavor, the black sesame rice snaps I savor without any dip/flavor as they are so delicious without anything else. Ingredients are simply whole grain brown rice, tamari and seaweed."
3,FROM BACK COVER,"Sweet and innocent no more! Abby Benton longed to cast off her closely guarded virginity - with her boss. Mere proximity to executive taskmaster Matthew Smythe, a.k.a. ""The American Earl"", left her quivering with sensual anticipation. And when his lips crashed against hers, the sexy aristocrat unleashed forces far beyond his control. For once he had fulfilled his mission as midnight mentor, Abby knew she could never entrust her body and soul to another. Matt considered their loving merely educational - he'd called marriage a ""fragile attachment' - but Abby had a different agenda. And as swiftly as boss had turned teacher, teacher would become husband..."
2,"OK product, but not pleased","This is a great design concept, but with all the weight of the folder contents, the bottom needs stronger accordion material to support the generally heavier contents. The material used for the front and back portions (the outer construction) is the same weight as other model without the hanging tabs. Because the material is not heavier, the folders bow and sag in the file drawer. This is a great concept, but the material is not strong enough to last over time, especially with the in an out frequency of this type of hanging file."
3,not durable enough,The product is too expensive for its use. when it is getting to be full it can't carry the weight and the hangers rip off.But there is no other solution in the market for filing 4 different subjects under the same project.
3,NOT FOR CASUAL READERS,"I found this tedious reading. Type size and spacing between lines is part of this. Having said this, the book offers excellent analysis and extensive research support for those who question our fire bombing of cities and use of the atomic bomb against the Japanese."
2,No excuse,"Inhuman incineration of 100's of thousands of civilians in their homes is somehow justified. What???Killing via firebombing civilians is inexcusable. The American Generals in charge ordering or allowing indiscriminate bombing of non-military targets and especially the residential areas should have been convicted of war crimes along with the Japanese.Granted, an all invasion would have killed staggering numbers of civilians. But incinerating their families would only increase the likelihood of Japanese soldiers fighting until the last man.Perversely leading to the use of the A-Bombs."
5,The best yet,"Was Hiroshima necessary? What about Nagasaki? Would the invasion of Japan really have cost the lives of a million American soldiers, or were the Japanese eager to give up? And hey, what about those Russians?People know amazingly little about the Pacific War, compared to the epic conflict between the white nations in Europe. Indeed, the first two weeks of August 1945 loom larger for the chattering classes than do the four years that preceded them--eight years if you date the war from the invasion of China proper--fourteen years if you consider that it started with Japan's annexation of Manchuria. I've been reading about the events of August 1945 for a decade, and I have to say that the analysis gets better as the years go by. Richard Frank's book is the best yet.(The answers are yes, probably, no, no, and they didn't have much to do with the surrender.)"
2,Does Not Fit the Phone,This car charger does not fit the Nokia 6102 (Cingular). We ordered two...need to return them both!
1,Bad Description,"This charger does not fit the 6102. I ordered it several months ago when I first got the phone but never got around to opening it until after the return period so now I'm stuck with it... Also, it isn't a Nokia brand charger and I was linked here from the phone's Amazon page where it said ""Nokia accessories""..."
1,Does not fit phone,Why would you put this charger in the area with the Nokia 6101 phones when it does not fit this phone? It was very frustrating to me to order it because it said it fit my phone and it get it and open it and it doesnt actually fit. That was a BIG waste of money!!! So if you have a Nokia 6101 even though it says it fits this phone DO NOT GET IT because it really doesnt fit it!!!
4,Another awesome release from this Israeli duo,"These guys rock! I first heard two of the tracks from this album at their live events (Cities of the Future, and Im the Supervisor) and fell in love with their evolved sound while still being a little concerned over the more commercial sound in comparison to their older work. This album though is truly sensational. Those tracks are here, and really rock, but other tracks such as Frog Machine and Bombat alone are worth the cost of the whole album."
5,The best chocolate flavor ever,"The best Dolfin flavor. It is so warm and spicy. I don't like milk chocolate at all, but these are like pure pleasure. Makes me think of the movie ""Chocolate"" with J Binoche & J Depp every time I eat one."
1,Try Windows XP network features first,"Connecting via wifi was a hassle (secure, but a hassle) and the printer sharing didn't work for me. File sharing did work.The program really slowed down my old Pentium4 so I dumped the McAfee Wireless and used the Windows XP networking options. I recommend using the basic Windows XP features before you go out and buy this product. You might not really need it."
4,Works okay.,Prefer the Pure Plug. This is tame enough. Should stop any whining about ozone smelling too strong. Design would go well with other hi tech ... toys.
5,great for cigarette smoke,"Have tried many different product out there to controlsmoke odor and this is by far the best. Takes up littleroom and the air is fresh and clean after a short time.After my husbands poker parties with cigars and cigarettesI just leave it in the room and when I wake up in the morningyou cant even tell. Its amazing, REALLY. Gave one to myparents who both smoke all day and you cant even tell anymorewhen you walk in the house. You would think, the product being sosmall, that it could not possibly do much, but it works betterthan the huge other products that requires filters and frequentcleaning. This unit requires nothing. Just dust it off every now andthen perfect. It REALLY WORKS WONDERS. Love it.Plan on buying another one soon.For those that say it makes noise or the fan stoppedworking, just keep the fan cleaned off with a little brush becausewith any fan you need to keep the accumulated dust and hair off tokeep the motor from burning out."
1,"A great product, but I got a 'lemon'",I have your product in several places in our company. I bought this product for my home and it worked for only one week. I have my paperwork and have been busy with a personal family problem and have not been able to call you.Please advise how I can get a replacement.Thank you.Suzie Davis
3,Did not Last,"When I first got this product, it was awesome. Clean, fresh smelling air. But unfortunately, it started making really bad noises after about 2 weeks, so I returned it. I have been looking for something that works as well, but so far I haven't found it."
2,Great For The 6 Months It Worked!,"Got it, worked great, loved it, 6 months later bulb went (no way to replace it)and it died.Don't waste your time or money!"
1,Worked Great but for only six months,"I used the Prozone air purifier in my caviary (guinea pig room) and it worked wonderfully...for six months, then the machine did not produce ozone any more. The fan still runs, but the bulb inside is no longer on. I think it is a bit too costly to buy a new air purifier every six months."
1,BECAREFUL!!!!!!! DANGEROUS!!!!!!,"I thought this unit was great, it removed smells and made the room smell great. The first one we had only lasted about 6 months, they did send a replacement which has lasted two years until last night when it started on FIRE flames shot out of the top and melted the whole unit, the smell is awful in the house and the house is filled with black soot THIS UNIT IS VERY UNSAFE TO DO THIS DAMAGE TO A HOUSE. THANK GOD FOR ADT OR OUR HOUSE WOULD HAVE BEEN DESTROYED."
2,Dies within a few years,This works well at deodorizing but read the reviews and you see the fan dies quickly and the bulbs shortly after that. I think I got two years out of mine. Better to buy one that generates ozone with plates instead of a bulb that burns out.
3,Not sure how much is attributed to the placebo effect.,"It smells like it is doing something (like after a rainstorm) but there isn't really anything to clean, and it is hard to tell how much it pulls out of the air. I use it as a masking agent on occasion. Turn it on for a while and let it cleanse the air, and then turn it off and put it away."
5,A truly captivating collection,"Aphrodisia: Art of the Female Form is a stunning, full-color artbook featuring photographs of sculpture, painting, digital art, and drawing by a wide variety of modern artists. All images were selected from among almost 1200 pieces, by a jury of six people: Joe Chiodo, Spencer Davis, Craig Elliott, Frank Frazetta Jr., Greg Hildebrandt, and Bud Plant. And all artworks have the common theme of celebrating the female form, whether as a fantasy warrior, a ""bad girl"", a far-future femme, or something else entirely. Though Aphrodisia's artworks are emphatically not pornographic, some have an erotic tone, and there are quite a few nude or extremely scantily clad female images. This is an artbook intended for adults, about reveling in the moment of female beauty. A truly captivating collection."
5,I'll order another,The sizing was a little small (had to order XL when I usually wear L) but I like the length for yoga as it's hard to find a long enough style for my torso.
3,A poor middleground between The Goal and a textbook,"When I read about ""The Goose Chase"" when it was first published, my first thought was ""Finally - someone wrote about changing Logistics and Distribution like Eli Goldratt wrote about Manufacturing. I was wrong. The author never develops his material into a cohesive blend of entertainment and education. The education material is presented towards the end of the story as a bulleted narrative rather than woven into the fabric of the story. While I wasn't disappointed by the lessons presented I was disappointed by the presentation and the shortcomings of my expectations."
5,You've got to let me chop it!,"I don't know what that means, but I like it! This is my first SCOTS CD; bought it about three weeks ago and can't stop listening to it. SCOTS are an interesting band. They lampoon/celebrate (lampoonibrate ?) aspects of southern and rural culture that may seem stereotypical; but as one who was raised in the Ozarks, I can tell you these songs hit close to home in a way that makes me smile with recognition. Liquored Up and Laquored Down?, seen it! Cheap Motels?; seen it, unfortunately. King of the Mountain?, yeah I've known a few. Corn Rocket?, uh well, no not yet. Haw River Stomp?, change it to Current River Stomp and I'm there.The music? Well it's not exactly country and I can't even say it's rock-a-billy; I also hear surf riffs and mexican horns. I don't know how to characterize it but it's good, high-energy fun with just enough poignancy to balance the raucousness. I'm still trying to figure out what Pass the Hatchet's all about though."
3,WHAT HAPPENED TO SCOTS?!,"Speaking as a long-time fan of SCOTS (I used to catch them at Cat's Cradle in Chapel Hill, the town where this CD was mastered), I just don't know what happened to them. I am used to that hard-edge, funky, punk, rockabilly sound they used to crank through their past albums(especially Dirt-Track Date). They have really cleaned up and smoothed out their sound with Liquored up & Lacquered Down. The tunes are still the same fun, white trash anthems we all expect from SCOTS, now with the keyboards adding a dimension missing in their earlier work. But if you are a SCOTS faithfull, do yourself a favor and buy something from their earlier collection instead of this one."
4,Strange Animal,"Liked the song ""Damaged Goods"" from the album. A car pool partner played selections from their various albums. Tends to be upbeat, which I like. Their music defies easy pidgeonholing... and might be called ""techno-redneck music"" or something like that. Their music is not maudlin in the way much of ""Country"" can be, which is a plus."
2,a dud from a usually great company,"We bought two of these coloring books for our girls, aged 4 and 6, who love to color detailed papers and love Bible stories. This book, being from Dover, we assumed it would meet their usual top-quality coloring books.About two thirds of the book is great, although, agreeing with another reviewer, the women's faces look a bit strange. Not that the girls noticed that. What they did notice right away was Eve, in her pre-sin state without even a bush in front to cover her, just some long hair over her chest.The usual godly women are pictured like Ruth, Abigail, Sarah, Mary, Deborah, and others; but along with them are Delilah, Judith (from the Apocrypha) holding a man's slain head, Bathsheba (while her godliness is not in dispute by me) with only part of a towel covering her and a David gaping at her in the background, along with Ahab's wicked daughter, and others.These negatives and more like it make me give the book a low review."
5,Saints' lives,"I thought this was a great book--I first checked it out at the library, then I wanted to have a copy of my own.I did learn about being more patient, but I learned MORE about Saint's lives. I found out more information on St Monica, St Augustine, the archangels, Joan or Arc, and MANY more saints from this book then I did from the internet. The author did a great job relating a saint's life to your life, and how you can be more saint-like. There are also a lot of great prayers included for each saint that is mentioned. If you are interested in saints. then read this book."
4,As the Christian daughter of a lesbian...,"I can safely say that this book makes an honest effort to approach the subject kindly and treat homosexuals in a loving way. I do not agree that homosexuality is just another lifestyle. I have watched my own mother go from lover to lover, never satisfied. She has had at least 13 lesbian partners in the past 14 years. She has finally found a woman that she is content to stay with but she is just that, ""content,"" not necessarily happy. She left the church years ago and has no use for religion, but she and I get along beautifully. We have learned to love in spite of our opposing views on her sexuality. I love my Mom and I know that the environment she was raised in was one of maternal loss (her mother died when she was 18 months old), profound loneliness, and verbal abuse from an unaccepting, often cruel grandmother. Jesus encouraged compassion for every mortal, lesbian or straight, conservative or liberal. I leave the judging part to Him."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this book. I was expecting a more balanced view about the topic; instead I felt I was bombarded with reasons to support homosexuality and Christianity together. I would have appreciated the space to come to my own conclusions. Drawing on different authors to compose the book was the most enjoyable aspect. In addition, I was hoping for some empirical, empirical data as an introduction to the topic."
2,poorly made,"I needed a pirate shirt for a party my husband & I were going to. This shirt is reasonably priced. It's quality however is very poor. The seams were crooked & the garment dingy. The fit was okay, he is 5'11"" 200lbs. It's fine if you don't mind poor quality. It's strictly a one time deal."
5,Great fit and look!,"I'm very satisfied with this outfit. It fits me great, but I am usually a size small or meduim for panties."
1,size does matter,This product was one size and the size was small. I am not a large woman and this didn't fit me very comfortably at all. The bra was ok but the thong/garter won't be worn again. I am very disappointed with this purchase.
5,Where was this book this summer?,"What a great book!I wish I would have had it this summer on my family ""car"" vacation. (The airplane mode of travel doesn't seem to be an option anymore.) I look forward to using many of the ideas in this book during the up coming holiday season on our way to the grandparents.The original ideas in this book far exceed the ""slug bug"" or ""row row your boat"" games and songs I played with my brothers and sisters in our family car. Additionally, Diane Flynn Keith has come up with ideas for activities for your shorter cross town excursions too. I have already done some of her activities and they worked.A must read for anyone who drives a car with children inside.Using Diane Flynn Keith's ideas has made my driving time enjoyable, less stressful, and has helped me be a better parent. I don't hear anymore, ""are we there yet?""This book is an easy read and more importantly fun!"
2,so-so,"This book is interesting, but worth waiting until it gets to the library. Carschooling is not a new idea, and many kids like mine learn naturally in the car, when we can talk and discuss things. I am not sure how safe it is to preplan things for the car that you might need to provide assistance for,etc. Seems to me carschooling is something that moms already do, not just one person's original idea. This author seems to think she has the corner on this idea , and really its nothing new that I haven't seen before. Well written however, and worth buying if you have read everything else. Nice to have a new homeschooling book on the market to read--"
3,Informative.,This book gives very detailed explanations about every aspect of Norse Mythology that you can think of. I does however seem a bit jumbled at time but definatly worth it.
2,Cheam and uninteresting,The toy is really not too impressive. My son played with it for maybe a week and put it on the side. Not really something I would spend 50 dollars on and the hose is a joke.
4,a great fire truck,Too complicated for a 2 year old...but probably great for a 3 -4 year old due to the mechanical parts. I think the mother of the grandson kind of set it aside until he got older and didn't get frustrated by trying to raise the ladder without cranking it.
4,bruder firetruck,this is a fine product. should have seen grandson's face when he found out it really squirted water! he's put out 400 + fires since christmas!
1,Disappointing.,"Toy came with no instructions. Everything written was German.Siren/horn came with its own AAA batteries. When case was opened, it revealed that the batteries were corroded. I have to run out for new batteries to see if the toy is broken, or if it is indeed the corroded batteries it came with.Lucky I found an ""instruction"" video on YouTube for this, or we would be clueless on the operation of the hose.Kids seems to like it - but he will be disappointed when the hose doesn't work and the siren proves defective, which I fully expect it to."
3,Fire hose is out of water,The only reason we paid a fortune for this fire engine is the hose squirts water. Well it was a matter of a few uses before the hose got a kink or something and stopped squirting. When it did squirt is shot water 15 to 20 feet. Can't seem to fix it.
4,Great toy for the budding fire fighter,"My son loves fire trucks, so we bought him this as a Chanukah present. It's very solid (actually made in Germany and not China) and has great detail. For us North Americans, however, it doesn't look like the fire apparatus that you'll see in your town. But it's a good size for Playmobil figures and, as I said, very durable."
1,Disappointed,"This was my first time to order through Amazon! I ordered the Bruder Man Firetruck with real water hose for my grandson. Which I am now sending back. I decided to open the toy the night before his party to make sure everything worked and if it needed batterys I could go ahead and put them in. I also, put the water in it to test how it worked. Thank goodness I did. There were so many holes in the hose it was unreal. the hose seemed to be dry rotted or something water squirted out everywhere and made a very big mess.I had to go out and get my grandson another present the next morning before his party. This was a present he had asked for and then I could not give it to him.Very disappointed in the product."
3,Not up to Bruder standards!!,"My son has a pretty decent size collection of Bruder trucks, and he was super excited to add the fire truck. He loves the lights and sounds and the squirting water, but I was less than impressed with the quality of this truck compared to the other Bruder trucks we have. The ladder keeps skipping when you try to extend it, the hose is very thin and cheap looking, and the quality of the plastic is more what you would see in brands that are half the price. My son likes it, so I won't be returning it, but I am not pleased with my purchase at all."
3,Disappointed,"I was excited to get this for my son for Christmas and was one of his 'big' presents. While he loves it and has been enjoying playing with it, I'm pretty disappointed at the overall quality. I don't expect it to last very long. This truck seems way overpriced to me."
4,Bruder Man Fire Engine,This product is well made and has lots of moving parts. A working fire hose was a great addition. I have bought other Bruder trucks for my nephew who is a truck fanatic and he loves it.
1,Not Accurate by >12F. Worthless,"Needed it as an outdoor thermometer for deck outside the kitchen window. Inaccurate by almost 12F at the 30F area. This is useless for someone who lives in WI and needs to know when it is below freezing outside to dress the kids, etc. Returned on same day that I got it."
2,Chaney thermometer performed poorly,Chaney Instrument 6 Inch Brass Finish Thermometer With BracketGreat size for reading from indoors. Easy to install. Poor performance. I checked accuracy against three other thermometers. The Chaney thermometer was 8 to 9 degrees off. This was too much for practical use.
1,junk,this product is junk it melted when it was installed this product was junk would not recommend any to buy it
1,too short,This product is TOO SHORT. It's the exact number for my car but it's about 2 inches too short. I even triple checked to be sure I purchased the right one. It will not fit without an extender. Try and find one of those in a pinch.....
3,Buy the 2000 edition for pictures and avices on restaurants,"Because France does not change that much, Michelin Green Guides (1997 edition) did not change either. They still keep this handy pocket format that all other publishers copied. They still are very shy with pictures. They don't tell you everything you would expect from a french guide-book. Still, they tell you what is most important. You cannot make any mistake if you follow their advice. So bring this guide-book with you ... and buy the Knopf or Eyewitness guide to get a more detailed view of our nice region. If you want to get advice from famous Michelin staff about restaurants and places to stay, buy the 2000 edition (english)of this book. If you are interested in more than just castles, read the ""Wine and food guide to the Loire"" from Jacqueline Friedrich and bring back home some bottles of Champigny wine."
2,Hunter quality is lacking,"First, I was't impressed with the overall look. It's very 80's. However, it is a Hunter product and a good price. I have used this product for 2 weeks. I have 2 cats and a dog in a small apartment. This is only used in the living room. It has done nothing to pick up any dirt and cat hair. I noticed on the top inside the grill most of the fan is covered with Styrofoam. It seems to block 3/4 of the fan. I called Hunter and asked if this is supposed to be there and they confirmed yes. So it's going back today."
1,USES TOXIC STYROFOAM PARTS,"BUYER BEWARE: I just set the unit up tonight and am horrified to find out that the inner lining of the fan area is made of styrofoam. Yes, the highly toxic substance that health groups are now advising be removed from all cooking, cleaning, and other products. In this case, the purified air from the filter has to blow over the styrofoam to reach the room. You may be cleaning up dust by using this filter, but you're adding that many more carcinogenic particles to the air. This product should be banned from the market--it is a health hazard, masquerading as a health product. I will be returning this product and not purchasing anything else from Hunter in the future."
1,bad motor,"The motor gets noisy after a couple of weeks. Also, there is no way to tell which way the hepa filter goes in. So, when diagnosing the motor problem I apparently put the hepa filter in the other way and the machine blew all the trapped particles back into the air and I had a massive allergy attack. This product is inexpensive for a reason."
1,it doestnt do anything,this thing does not do anything other than making a noise maybe its only made for small rooms like 2x2 or something
2,2 Month life span - really?,"I received this unit on October 20, 2012 and it ran for 2 months - almost to the day and died. It worked great up until then, but I feel it should last longer than two months! I'm not happy."
5,It works!,The unit does exactly what it's supposed to do - filter/clean the air in our bedroom and it is quiet!
4,Wake up and smell the clean air...,"I love this filter! After one week I was shocked at how much dirt it cleaned up from our air. You do have to replace the filters but it is totally worth it.If it is in the room with you and you are trying to talk or watch tv it is very NICE to be able to turn it down, to hear better without having to turn it off. Don't get me wrong, even the high setting is NOT that noisey. I highly recommend this air cleaner for the price and for the quality."
4,Compact decent arifiler,"The Hunter 300090 appears to have decent build quality. Fan is not as quiet as I was hoping for, but should not be too loud in most situations and does move a lot of air. Filter is easy to replace. Unit is nice that you can mount on the wall, lay on its side, or stand upright."
1,Something Burning ??,"The air was better befor using this , seems to emit a burnt plastic smell - Sending Back for refund, advise staying away from this product."
3,Ok,Well after turning it on... strong smell... been running it for a full week nonstop and the smell is finally going away. Also have to leave it on its side or if you stand it up.. something rubs making a noise.. probably fan. Hopefully It does clean the air.
5,Hunter 30090,Recevied on time. Set up an woking in 10 minutes. It is in the dogs' (4)room and pulls a lot of the hair and dander. I really notice the difference.
4,worth the money,Purchased this after favorable reviews and researching different products. Is quiet and does an effective job. Would recommend.
1,Lasted 3 months,"I p-urchased this unit from Amazon and within 3 months of intermittent use, the unit failed. It ceased to run. When it ran it as very silent and apparently effective in a small room. The quality however was wanting."
3,Air Purifier,"When I initially started the purifier there was a distinctive smell, kinda like plastic for a few days. It appears to be working though, less allergy symptoms for my wife and it really helped during those santa ana winds!"
5,Nice little Hepa Filter,"I already own two similar Hunter models (and have for a couple of years), and I recently bought two of this model. They're very reliable filters that are appropriate for a bedroom or similarly sized room. The replacement hepa filter medium is not cheap, but they rarely are. Prefilter media can be obtained inexpensively, and are ideally changed often. The housing on this model is trivially easy to open, and changing the filters takes around one minute, and you will be amazed by all the filth that the filter has removed.The unit has mechanical controls, which I like because it means it can be used with a timer or a remote controlled outlet. The highest setting is perhaps a bit loud for sleeping, unless you want a ""sleep hummer"" effect. At its lowest setting, it is minimally audible. I definitely recommend this model."
5,Great quiet air filter. QUALITY,Have used this hepa purifier in our baby's room for over a year now with no issues. In fact I might order another one since the filters are about $50 and I can get a whole new one for $59 on amazon.
4,Replacement filters cost too much!!,I have been very pleased with this air purifier until today. Replacement filters cost more than the purchase price of the purifier. It makes more sense to buy a new unit instead of purchasing the replacement filters.
2,worked great for awhile,Well this filter worked great for about a month. Then it started to rattle a little but only sometimes. Now when it's running it has a burning smell and sometimes I have to hit it to get it to turn on. I'm going to have to check the warranty information.
3,The Man's Point of View,"I picked up this book because it belonged to a series called 'Bachelor Territories' i.e. it was written prominantly from the man's point of view. I thought that would make an interesting change because nearly all romances only show the woman's side of the story. The plot itself is light and funny at times. However, the hero seemed too conservative (a bank executive !) and the girl seemed too frivolous (a night-club dancer) for them to make an ideal match. Since the book didn't much show the girl's point of view, it was hard to understand why she was so attracted to the man. Furthermore, though she was supposed to actively pursue her man, we didn't see much action on her part."
3,A Bit Too Much Cake...,"I find that this cover-up is not yellow enough to cover dark purple or blue-ish under eye circles that look almost like bruising (which is how mine are). It starts as a nice cream consistency but then finishes a little bit too cakey, settling into my under eye wrinkles. I tried wearing an additional brightener on top, but honestly I'm not very impressed."
3,Chrome finish pitted,"It's a nice scoop, but after a few months the finish pitted (we ran it through the dishwasher). It would be fine if handwashed."
1,It's A Fake...Not Stainless Steel,"As several other people have reported, the scoop is not stainless steel but plated pot-metal (albeit somewhat thick, which disguised it for some time). Shame on Cuisinart (or maybe even Amazon) for lying to its customers. A pity because I had loved it otherwise."
3,Ice Cream Scoop,"Color is as illustrated. Does scoop up ice creameasily, but handle seems a little large and doesn'treally have a great grip to it.'"
5,Best Scoop!,"I've tried many many ice cream scoops, but none have compared to this Cuisinart! It fits in your hand perfectly and scoops with ease. Others are hard to hold (handles are too big) or do not scoop well. It has held up well after years of use and many trips in the dishwasher - still looks and works like new. Just bought a 2nd one as a gift for my mom."
1,Horrible quality,"I had a gift certificate from Amazon, so I bought this DVD. Boy was that a waste. This DVD is horrible quality. It's basically like some kid with a cheap cam corder recorded a bootleg copy of a concert and added in some lame transitional effects. The sound quality is terrible, and the sound cracks everytime Lea reaches any high or loud notes in her singing."
3,beautiful voice,"She always has her sweet and beautiful voice. Every song in the DVD is performed perfect by her. As musical fans, you should have this one for your collections.The only thing it disappoints me is Lea's dressing style, not suitalbe for her. But it's nothing to do with the DVD, just the one who did making up for Lea."
5,"Lea Salonga (the original ""Miss Saigon"")...amazing concert!","If you love Lea and broadway, you need to own this DVD. From start to finish she is breathtaking. Her phrasing is impeccable with a voice to match. Her version of ""Someone To Watch Over Me"" in my opinion has never been done so beautifully, and with just a guitar backing her. The San Miguel Philharmonic lead by her brother Gerard is equally wonderful. Bravo Lea!"
4,pretty good,"because i am from baltimore and my friend recommended this doc, i decided to check it out. it was pretty good. i liked kevin's story, but would have liked to see more about how/why he developed elmo. too bad about all this other drama too :("
5,Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey,"If you've read my other reviews you know that, without fail, many of my favorite movies on are documentaries. That said, one of the true gems of 2011 that few moviegoers got to see was about a puppeteer and the wildly popular character he brought to life. Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey is about as accurate as a title can be: director Constance Marks profiles one Kevin Clash, the man who grew up crafting his own puppets, dreamt of meeting Jim Henson, eventually landed a gig on Sesame Street, and reinvented a furry red muppet to become one of the most widely beloved of them all. Not surprisingly, I found the film sweet and charming, not least because Clash himself is such an endearing character, and its upbeat narrative left me feeling a little inspired. Being Elmo is a fascinating feel-good story about a man who followed his dreams without compromise and almost inadvertently created a cultural icon."
3,For a personal documentary its interesting,This documentary was interesting to see how Elmo was created and what a huge global icon he is. It was a good personal story of Elmo's puppeteer and how he made it into the industry. It was nice to see once but I wouldn't own the movie.
2,Not enough book for the money,"If you are going to only buy one book on pumping, buy ""Pumping Insulin"", not this book. This book is very small (60 pages, and 5 1/2""x4"") and doesn't fully explain all the concepts it goes into. (For example, it mentions the 1800/1500 rule, but doesn't explain when you would use either number.) It does have some good suggestions on where to wear the pump, and similar issues. My suggestion, if you can get this book for very cheap, and you already know the basics, pick it up. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother."
4,Absolutely disgusting!,"This isn't the type of book for the ""easy-veiwing"" crew but the photography, quality of printing, & subject matter is top notch! Not for everyone but if you're curious what the inside of your chest cavity or skull looks like (after it's been cut & clamped open, of course!)this is the book for you!"
4,Riding the secular fence.,"First off I loved their first album LTTP; And love Hawk Nelson. I pretty much only listen to Christian Rock (Kutless, switchfoot, Relient K, FM Static, others) and I bought Hawk's new release at my local Christian book store...Problem is that after listening to it I did not here one song that I felt had a Christian message (and brother I listened close!). Don't get me wrong many FM Static, and Relient K, songs are not totally Christian themed either (many of which I love) but DUDE you got to give something back to the Christian base that bought your first album...I mean throw me a Christian Bone here guys.If your put off by Christian music you have no threat of being offended here. If your looking for Christian Music you may want to skip this album, or for that matter buy evanescence's Fallen, its more Christian that this one.My rating is for the skill of the band NOT is lack of meaning full content."
2,misleading,this is not a Christian album.the music on here has nothing to do with God.It should be in the world music section because that's all it is.
5,Not the End of the World for This Band...,"From the first time I heard ""Every Little Thing"" from Hawk Nelson's first CD, I have loved this band. Fortunately and unfortunately, they have greatly matured from their first album to create Smile, It's the End of the World. While traces of their old style remain, this album sounds much different than their last one. While it is still as ""unfocused"" as their past work, this album is on a different side of the pop/rock spectrum. Fans of the old record might be appalled by the change of style, as was I, but will most likely be quickly converted. Every song has something to offer. Some are happy and poppy, others edgier, and some even throw in a little Gospel flare.Overall, this is a CD that does what it does right. No matter the atmosphere of the song, it is communicated effectively, and ultimately catchy. No one who enjoys this genre should miss out on this one."
3,It's OK,"This album has a light, fun sounding feel to it. It is intended to appeal to teenagers and seems to have a sound that they like.It is rather meaningless lyrically. It is full of fluff and little meaningful content. Hawk Nelson is purported to be a Christian band, but I heard nothing in this album that would validate that. Some of the songs are boy-girl love songs. Some others are hard to tell what they are even about - mainly nonsense.In spite of the fairly trivial nature of the lyrics, there is nothing offensive about them. This is not an album that parents would need to worry about being a bad influence on kids.There is one song that sounds pretty good: 'Everything You Ever Wanted'. A couple of others are kind of catchy.Overall, it is an ok album. It is not one that I particularly enjoy, but I'm sure it has some appeal for its intended audience."
3,positive music in a negative world,"Ok, I didn't enjoy this cd as much as the ""Letters to the President,"" but I must admit that the band has matured in their sound and have done an alright job on this one. A few of the songs drag, but I must admit that my favorite song ""Everything You Ever Wanted"" is reason in itself to buy the cd. After experiencing a painful breakup, this song has so much personal meaning that I feel that God has used it to speak personally to me (to others as well perhaps).Overall, I don't think this cd was as strong as I expected, but I certainly wouldn't tell anyone not to buy it. Hawk Nelson is certainly a quality Christian group that the Christian music industry should be proud to have. As the cd says itself, it is a positive attempt at something in such a negative world. Well said!"
2,Hit and miss,"*Smile, it's the end of the world* is the second original hawk nelson release to date. First came ""Letters To The President"", followed by a reissue of Letters with some bonus tracks. Unlike Letters, Hawk Nelson take a different approach from the punk-pop of past days. There are a few standout tracks, like the sing-a-long song ""The One Thing I Have Left"", the heartfelt ""Everything You Ever Wanted"" and the energetic, bouncy ""Head On Collison"", but most failed to keep my attention. I will say that the one and two stars reviews are a bit harsh, but I can understand them too. *Smile, it's the end of the world* is sub-par at best, and I'm sure most HN fans have already figured that out. If you're new to HN, or you're just looking for some quality punk-pop, check out Letters To The President instead."
3,Worth the buy just for hello,"This single is ok at best, Talk shows on mute was never the best song, though neither was the entire album (crow left of the murder). You get a live version too here which sounds no different at all to the studio version.Wish you were here is nto a bad version but it has been done a number of times before.The highlight of this single is hello (lionel ritchie cover). The piano has been replaced with guitar but it still retains the beauty of the original, with brandon doing a nice job with the song as well."

4,granny,This costume is still the talk of many occasions! Very funny. I had to make a few alterations but overall a good costume.
2,worked well for the first 10 month and then accuracy went below 15min per day,The watch worked quite well for the first 10 month and then began useless. I will try to get fix it since it has 1 year warranty.... I bought the watch from MR. WATCH
3,Can anyone tell me if the neck should be thinner on the low e side?,"Can anyone tell me if the neck should be thinner on the low e side?Whether I look down from the top or the bottom of the guitar I can see there is a substantial difference. It's like it on there slanted, its not twisted, it's equally off the entire length, nut to bridge. My substantially better built Tama/Ibanez does not do this at all and I need to know if I should return this one for another. I am not expecting perfection, but it's probably 1/8 of an inch or more difference. If I were to try to file the bridge down I would have but purposely angle it. And then I would have to do the same to the nut."
5,BEST PRICE FOR BEST GUITAR,"This is really a good guitar. If you are a beginner, I would recommend this guitar to you. Good looking, perfect sound, every thing is great."
5,Absolutly great for the money!,I have no idea how they can sell these for this low of a price! Absolutely wonderful. My brother is an accomplished guitarist that repairs and sets up guitars. He had very little to adjust to have it playing great. He was also very impressed with the quality and price!
3,Jasmine By Takamine S34C,Dark stain spots on face of guitar. Stain drips on sides of guitar. Other minor imperfections. Appears to be a factory second. I will still keep this as an introductory guitar for my son. Acceptable for the price.
5,Perfect for the Price,"My wife got me this as a Valentine's Day gift. We paid < $100 USD. This is no high-end Guild, obviously, but for the price I am extremely pleased. This is my first acoustic. As other reviewers indicated, the strings needed to be changed... I put on some nice Elixir 12s, and the guitar plays like a silky smooth dream. It has a sweet sound and is much more than I thought I was going to get. As another reviewer put it, this is a great ""pick up and play"" guitar. I am not picky at all about the wood used in construction, etc. - if you are, then you should look into higher end models. Completely 100% satisfied with this purchase."
2,Not what I expected,"The Jasmine looks and feels nice,but when I tried to tune it,the top E string had an annoying vibrating sound and the bottom E string was ""dead"".Some adjustment of the truss rod helped,but I can't understand how a guitar could make it out of the factory sounding like that.It's obvious no one in quality control gave it a test before packing it in the carton.Even with the adjustments,it seems the strings that came with the guitar are not well suited to it and it still lacks the quality sound I was led to expect."
4,Oh?,I bought the guitar and a strap and there is only one place to attach the strap. Is this some sort of joke? Otherwise the guitar is beautiful but that makes me pretty pissed
4,Ok guitar for price,The guitar looks great--the only complaint I have is that the action is not set quite right and there is a little buzzing on the low string.
4,Very good,"I own a Telecaster and a Classical but wanted a steel string and bought Jasmine and it's a deal price wise. I did pay a guitar shop to do the setup $50 and they lowered the action and new strings and I'm happy how it plays now ( the lower the strings makes it easer on the fingers ) Great sound . The Nexbody is as large as a jumbo at the bottom and the narrow cutaway next to the neck but if I had to do again I'm sure I would buy a much smaller guitar. Still it sounds great, big volume , and the strings ring out like a jumbo."
4,Jasmine,"I like this guitar, it's a great quality and looks sexy. It has been a while since I've received the guitar but I do remember the shipment was well handled, and the guitar came without a scratch. The sound is a bit off now, I don't know if it was warped, but I'm rather dissapointed considering my fender squire acoustic is still in great shape. Which I would say they are somewhat comparable. Overall good construction, great deal, could'nt be more satisfied!"
5,Love it!,"I just have to say that I'm a complete, out-of-the-box, BEGINNER guitar player and decided to purchase this guitar because of the hundreds of rave reviews and especially the price! I'm floored! It sounds BEAUTIFUL, arrived in perfect condition and I've had zero issues with it. All I had to do was tune the strings - which were already strung - and away I went. I feel extremely lucky to be able to buy a guitar for under $100 and have it feel and sound so wonderful. I can't seem to put it down, except when I HAVE to because my finger tips are killing me! Can't WAIT to get those callouses built up! I highly recommend it for any beginner out there. By the way, for any other beginners out there, I've been using a product called 'TUF_FOOT' which is used to toughen dog paws. So far I really do believe it's helping!!! I'm only on day 3 of receiving/playing my Jasmine and though my fingers do hurt, I expected them hurt more at this point in my journey!"
2,"I liked it, but its quality is bad","2 stars mean ""I don't like it""... It's not that I didn't like it, it's just that it's quality is bad. And it doesn't matter how much I paid for it, it's how much its list price is. This should have a reasonable good quality for its list price. Instead, the one I bought came with a bad neck, buzzing a lot. I'm not going to tell the whole story here, but I ended up returning it.Unfortunately, I learned the worst way that, sometimes, I should buy things in local stores. Sometimes, you must touch it, try it, feel it, before you buy it.If you don't care about it buzzing or if you're willing to pay the same price you paid for the guitar to fix it such that it's usable, buy it. Otherwise, go to your local store and choose the guitar you like most."
5,I believe this is the best guitar for the money. Period. In the whole world. Unless you find one for free.,"A friend of mine discovered one of these in a music store and we were both surprised by the quality of the sound and the look/feel of the instrument. I have a Yamaha acoustic that I paid $300 for, and with the exception that it is not acoustic-electric, this guitar is no worse, in fact, probably better. The sound is big and clear. The looks are good for the price; I love the matte finish and the cutaway. Sure, it's got a lamenent top, but it really does sound wonderful. I was not surprised at all by the fact that this guitar has almost a perfect 5/5. I have bought a total of 3 to date."
4,Jasmine by Takamine Acoustic Guitar,"Good find on this one, especially if you just want a reasonably priced, quality guitar! Be a great buy for a beginner or someone who just likes to sit around a campfire and entertain!"
2,DISAPPOINTMENT,"I guess you pay for what you get. I just wish manufacturers (Takamine) and sellers (Brooks May) perform better quality control before they ship out their products.PROS: It's a beautiful guitar in terms of appearance. The satin finish and the woods used are very pretty.CONS: On delivery the 2nd fret and 5 fret on the high E string were dead.Only one guitar strap button on the guitar.The quitar strings were low quality and old. Be prepared to restring.Simple quality control before shipping out would have resolved these problems. You can't play the guitar with dead frets! A visit to my quitarman and 50 bucks later, after setup, new strings (Martins) and one more strap button made the guitar what it should have been from the start. Of course, the price for the guitar is good, but beware a visit to your guitar shop may be necessary."
3,not bad for beginner,"i been wanting to learn how to play guitar, now i save some money so i bought it. when it came the 4th 5th and 6th string is a little rusty i dont know y. aint it suppose to new? took me like an hour to tune it to tone. 1 of the string snap like it broke but it didnt, i was shock cuz i heard a load snap. all i did was release the tense of the string and put it back into tune.if ur a beginner guitar player like me, u should buy it, even tho the string a little rusted but it still make a nice sound. am still learning.if u know how to play i suggest u buy something more expensive cuz u wont like wat u paid for. ill keep the guitar but i wont buy it from amazon for guitar no more, i would go to the actual site to buy it or go to a guitar store and buy one, cuz u see wat u getting here u just a picture which u probably dont like."
3,slow boat in th year of lord 2010,"will not be ordering from this company again. the product is resonable for the price,but when you are sent an e-mail saying that the shipping date that you'll be reciveing the product is on 1-25-10 And on the 1-28-10. and you are trying to find out what happened to that product. And the guy tells me it was ship out ,but customer service can't tell me when it's going to reach me. so i said to him should i give it a week or two and he said yeah that sound about right. Ha..Ha.. Went on vacation and got a call on 2-4-10 from my son-inlaw saying dad you got a package order in the mail told him ask the post master how did the company send the package post master responded by boat???? I said to son-inlaw I belive this is the yaer 2010 they could have parcel post air..... UPS FEDEX I belive they still service the 50TH State HA..HA....."
1,Wrong order,They sent wrong guitar. But the sales rep contacted me immediately and is doing her best to fix the issue.. More details when/if the issue is resolved..
5,Takamine Acoustic Guitar,"We purchased this guitar last Christmas for our 12 year old daughter, who is a beginning guitar player. It has been a great guitar! The quality is very good for the price we paid (Around $125) and has a very nice tone. I would definitely recommend this guitar."
4,"Check everything, the bridge that holds the strings at the bottom","Check everything....the bridge that holds the strings at the bottom was cracked between each pin. I really like the guitar and my instructor said it was good for the money, however, they do take cuts somewhere to lower the costs. So be sure to check every part of the guitar, from top to bottom. Had to put new strings on...others were tarnished and rough on fingers.. otherwise, good buy !"
4,Great for away from home,"Currently living on a naval base and having this guitar is turning into a lifeline. Great for on the go playing, mind you the quality is not as good as a regular Takamine. Great sound except for the strings that came with the guitar, which are a little rotted. Advise anyone who purchases this guitar to get new strings in advance and to change the tuning pegs. This guitar has great action and is great for anyone to play, beginner to advanced. Action is smooth and though finish is rugged, the guitar has a lot of character and a great full sound."
4,"Stained., Kind of dissapointed...","When the package arrived at my door., the tape and box was bent and a little opened. I didnt mind as i was opening the package because inside it was another box., the guitar box. I opened it and nothing was broken . Except there is an inch of which looks like black ink smeared on the guitar near the pick. I was very dissapointed, i tried getting it off but it looked as if it was permanent. that nothing could get it off. Other than that, the guitar is great, just need a change of new strings. and good to go! im happy with the price of the guitar and its quality.But the stain is very noticable.. :("
5,Great buy,Sounds much better than most guitars in the 500-800 price range. Looks good too. 20 yrs of plinking around guitars and hacking songs into obscure mating calls.
3,Some Visual Concerns,"Ok, I guess you really do get what you pay for. I'm a Brass Man, but want to learn the guitar so I thought I'd be safe and order this Jasmine/Tak as a safe choice in the event I actually get better and eventually want something better. This guitar sounds good but when I received it I discovered that the back has a 1 in. dent obviously passed off to me the buyer on line. The finish on the front has a couple of knot spots that make it look like blemishes. It was not sold as a blem. or second, but if I had the choice when looking at it I would have purchased a different guitar. I guess I'll accept it instead of sending it back and paying the shipping for a replacement. I think the seller took advantage of me by giving me a guitar that they couldn't sell at their store. Lesson Learned!"
5,Sweetest Guitar I have,I just love this guitar and play it more than my other 25 guitars no joke if you buy this one you'll be happy with it
4,No regrets,"For the price of this instrument, the perks of it is pretty amazing. Sounds great, feels great and looks great. With the right set of strings this guitar can easily be compared to top brand guitars. The only thing negative that I could say is the cosmetic aspect of it. I'm assuming some got lazy and didn't quite finish it off well. A few minor chips and scratches on the sides and sound hole. The fact that I absolutely loved this product made me overlook those slight cosmetic damages. Jasmine guitars have not failed to impress me yet. I would definitely consider purchasing this guitar again if anything where to happen to my S34C. Also, the S35 guitar isn't bad neither. This specific guitar is an upgrade to that one but either or is great. Recommend this guitar for anyone trying to explore more into the world of acoustics."
5,Good product for the price,"With a low price tag, this is one of the coolest Guitar I have played so far. The size, acoustics are just appropriate. The finishing of the guitar is more of matte and woody, a bit of gloss finishing would have gone a long way, but that is the least of concerns considering the sound and overall quality of the guitar. Would definitely recommend for beginners and learners. I have to tune it everytime I pick it up to play but thats probably because the strings are fairly new and the weather conditions, but I am sure as this gets older it would become much better. Amazon did a pretty good job under its ""Prime"" plan in delivering the product quickly, the seller could have packed the guitar in a bit more sturdy way with bubble wraps and stuff, but Fedex did a good job in handling the package."
5,Fabulous,"This is a great beginner guitar. We purchased it for our son's 10th birthday so he could take guitar lessons. The owner of the store suggested we have the bridge adjusted to lower the strings to the finger board. This made it much easier for our son to play and when we did this new strings were put on too. It sounds so much better now with the new strings. It also stays in tune well, which is another indicator of good quality."
4,inexpensive with a really nice sound,"I didn't want to spend a lot of money on whatever new guitar I purchased because I was planning on using it for alternate tunings, however after receiving the S34C and doing a little fiddling with it, I was surprised how good it sounded and played. I decided to use my other guitar for the alternate tunings for now. I slotted the bridge to lower the strings into the bridge and made a new bone saddle to replace the plastic one that came with the guitar. This guitar is laminate top to bottom, but really has a nice sound. For under a $100 you can't beat it."
5,Wonderful surprise!,"I am new to the guitar world and have only taken lessons for a short time. I just wanted to voice that this guitar arrived unharmed and in record time. After a quick tuning, it was ready to play. The sound, quality, and beauty of this instrument was MUCH MORE than I expected. I have been playing it for only two days. It is easy to play for a beginner and it has launched me into a new world. thank You - Takamine."
4,Jasmine by Takamine S34C,"For the price, this acoustic is hard to beat. Action on mine is nice and low. No fret buzz issues at all. Decent sound. Tuners actually hold very well, better than I expected at this price. The workmanship on mine is quite good for less than $100.00. However, the frets could use a little filing on the ends along both sides of neck - but certainly still playable. I will try my hand at that little project with a file I purchased at the Stewart McDonald website when I restring it next time.Remember, this is Not a $500 - $1000 guitar. Good for a take anywhere guitar - beach, campout, ...and hey if something happens to it you are not out much and can get another. Also, great as a starter to find out if you really want to stick with learning guitar.If you are doing recording or live gigs, this may not be for you, otherwise just a fun, low priced guitar to have fun with. (As always, good strings keep the tone sounding good.) Rock On & GOD BLESS!!!"
1,Surprised at the good reviews,"Maybe I got a lemon? I ordered this one after reading so many good reviews, but ended up receiving a guitar in the mail that had a severe two tone discoloration down the front (one half light wood, the other half dark) and a pick guard that had fallen off. I found it at the bottom of the box. Cosmetic things sure, but I guess I'm a little picky about how my guitars look. Didn't even bother playing it. Had a helluva time getting the company to complete the return with it as well. After months (literally), I finally got them to take it back. I know Takamine is a very reliable name so it is likely I just got a lemon, but still."
3,Just so-so,"Its sound is not so good compared with my last guitar's. And I have paid more for the current one. The amazon said it should be a new one, but its strings are all rusty. The body seems nice."
3,You Get What You Pay For,Does not sound very good. High action. The pickguard was installed crooked. It is attractive overall. I changed the stock strings as soon as I got it to Martin's. Still not to expectations for the reviews and price. I am going to lower the action at the saddle. Maybe will get better. Stays in tune pretty well.The high action causes buzzing with chords. I may change the nut also. You get what you pay for.
5,Christmas Gift,"Fabulous beginning instrument for my daughter, thanks so much for the speedy delivery that made to be opened Christmas morning."
4,Jasmine By Takamine S34C NEX Acoustic Guitar,"I did a lot of research before I bought this guitar for my son who is a begining player. The guitar looks beautiful, and has a nice rich, full sound. My only disappointment is that the neck needs to be adjusted as 2 strings twang against the frets. My husband assures me that it is adjustable and a common issue with new guitars."
5,Worth Every Penny,"My inlaws live in South Florida, and I wanted a basic guitar to have there. I ordered this guitar and it came in and had a rather big nick in the kneck on 1st fret by B string. I sent it back and as I have always had w/ Amazon, there were no problems. Before I noticed the knick, I played for about a 1/2 hour and was very impressed. I went to the local Sam Ash music store and all the cheap guitars were nothing in comparison to the sound I had w/ this guitar despite the nick. I figured the heck with it, I want that sound, for the price, i'll take a little blemish, so I ordered it again.Again, the sound is awesome. The intonation is spot on. The kneck is a little frayed at the top(not a big nick like the first),there is some other smaller blemishes, but like I said, for the price of this guitar, you are not going to find a better sound unless you pay a lot more.So if you want a beater guitar or if you are starting to play, I highly recommend this guitar."
2,NOT WORTH IT,"This book is not worth your time or money! I was expecting it to contain the translations in full (for the Reading Latin ""Text"" book), however that's not the case at all. All you get are hints to help you through the text but that's as far as it goes.It contains SOME of the answers to the exercises from the GVE book but not all.Definitely not worth buying in my opinion."
2,"Using Sidwell? You need this book and a keg of prozac, mate.","Better yet, do yourself or your students a favor and FORGET SIDWELL.This cancer on the body of Latin education has impaired and imperiled students for too long. Choose Wheelock, chooseScanlon, choose to sit down and memorize Lewis and Short, but please, please, don't keep buying this putrid and detestablemockery of a language course. If you need evidence of this man's utter madness, look to the mind-numbing exercises devoid of holistic comprehension, and to the chaotic presentation of grammar. Introducing the passive voice a dozen chapters after deponents? Absurd! Criminal! This study guide might be necessary, but it is also clumsy in arrangement and difficult to navigate. The mise en page is likely to scare new students, and turn them away from what can be a very fun and accessible language without the obstacle of a rotten mushroom like this guy. Sidwell: the sun has set on your empire of tears; you have had your day."
5,Very Inspirational,"This book is very inspirational. The fact that most of these businesswomen started out as homemakers with no previous business background is incredible. It really makes me believe that if they can do it, so can I!"
4,great book!,"A wonderful book for those who enjoy reading cookbooks. Wonderful comments, lovely fonts, make for an inspiring read. Great descriptions of the birds and their uses as well."
2,no title,"This attempt at a comprehensive naval special warfare(NSW) history leading up to formation of Navy SEAL teams and their deployment to Vietnam has only one thing to recommend it: numerous first-hand accounts by NSW unit & team veterans. Otherwise, it suffers from poor editing in the text itself and ill-conceived structural arrangement. And it contains a fatal flaw, for nowhere in the book does the author cite a single source or reference for the information he presents,except the self-referencing first hand accounts, thereby violating the First Commandment of the history profession. The result is often clumsy paraphrasing that could leave the author open to charges of plagairism. Also, by not citing his sources or supplying a bibliography, he denies the curious reader any chance of following through with his or her own research of a particular item mentioned in the book. Let's hope he does better next time."
2,Old timers reminisce,"Imagine a group of WWII veterens sitting around reminiscing. Now record this word for word, and put their ramblings, unedited, into a book. That describes this book.For example:""The Navy reactivated me for duty with the Naval Beach Group at Little Creek, Virginia, in 1950. I stayed there about six months before going back to demolition work with UDT4. AT UDT4, I spent about two months as the executive officer of the team. Then I was sent over to UDT 2, where I took the position of CO. UDT 2 was a long assignment; I was there from 1951 to 1958, "" p. 43 blah, blah, blah. So WHO CARES!?This book doesn't do justice to the brave men who fought in WWII, such as my father. It is very poorly edited. It deserves to be placed deep in the Navy Archives as a verbal history. Not on your bookshelf."
2,scent doesn't stay,"it is a lovely scent, but who cares if it doesn't endure the 5 minuteride to work. i tried it 3 separate days, wearing more each time.im going to try some other bvulgari fragrances, but nowim nervous about it. this was my first. luckily i didnt invest inlarge bottles."
5,favorite perfume,"The only perfume I've used for years. Has a light jasmine & orange blossom fragrance. The only problem with it is that it wears off very quickly. If you want something that lasts all day, you'll be disappointed. However, unlike other perfumes I've tried, this one smells the same when I use it right after a shower and when I use it later in the day."
3,Great Scent that lasts seconds,"This is a great scent out of the bottle. No sooner than i put it on after the shower got dressed, drove to work, it had already began to fade. By the end of my 7 hour day. It was gone, gone, gone."
5,Early Margaret -- still Margaret!,"If you have seen or heard ""I'm the One that I Want"" or ""Notorious C.H.O."" and enjoyed them, then you must listen to Drunk with Power. Some of Margaret's routine from this album is repeated in the other two performances, but it is interesting to see the difference in Margaret's attitude toward her weight, network executives, and other topics over the years. This CD is highly recommended to even the most casual Cho fan!"
3,Lord Londonderry's Follies,"An intrinsically important and engaging subject treated by Ian Kershawin quirky prose and in a numbingly repetitious fashion. Historians,of course, do a lot of research but they don't have to stuff it all intoone book. A terser narrative perhaps one half the size would havedone the trick beautifully. I read the whole thing but some of it(especially the overly-detailed figures on Britain's preparations forairwar under Londonderry's ministry in the '30's) was a slog.Also, my hardcover edition was full of typos."
4,The U.K. between the Wars,"Ian Kershaw, who--I believe--has written the best two volume work on Hitler, here brings his very deep talents to the pre-World War II life of a secondary English aristocrat. Londonderry's story serves to illustrate the ambiguities existing in the broad sweep of British poltical life in the face of a rising and aggresive post-World War I Germany. All the policy options in the 1930s were not as clear cut as they appear to be today with our full knowledge of the horror brought about by the Nazis. This book also shows the dying out of a way of life for the social/ political class represented by Lord Londonderry. A very good book to help one understand the 1930s in the U.K."
1,"Boring, Boring",I am an avid reader of WWII books but this has to be the most boring of the 150 books I have read.
1,"BIBLE is GREAT, Service is BAD","I love this Bible. Its the easiest to read and easiest to understand. When I can find them for a decnet price I buy them for friends and family. The one star is for the ""once again"" poor service through the amazon sight. It took 12 days to get here!. They didnt even ship it until 6 days after I ordered it."
5,What SHE wanted,I bought it for my wife as a gift and she loves it! Get one of theses bibles for yourself!
3,Good content but odorific book.,"This used book came complete with an unpleasant odor which is somewhat neutralized by using a drier sheet for a book mark. Other than that, its a good translation and I'm enjoying the daily devotional."
5,Love Max Lucado...,"Purchased as a gift, But enjoyed looking through it. Great commentary by the fabulous Max Lucado!"
5,Great,"The copy I received was in very good condition. All the pages were in brand new condition, and there was only a small dent on the front cover. And this is an awesome Bible, by the way. Easy to read and there are some wonderful devotional tools."
3,Ok at best,I understand it is used but having stains on it is kind of gross. Who even knows what the stain is!
5,"SIMPLY THE BEST, MOST READABLE BIBLE EVER.","Max Lucado does it again. This DYNAMIC Bible is a joy to read and has many great features.The one feature I wish worked differently for my kindle is Mister Lucado's personal commentary always appears before the beginning of each chapter, while in my hard book text version it appears in the margins where it can be read last.But for the occasional Bible Reader this text presents a simple,less confusing and illustrative adventure, allowing the chapters to come alive and give a reader a most pleasent readable experience."
5,Very nice,"I really love this book. It has different reading plans. It has a 30 day plan for new Christians, it has a 2 year plan if you are interested in reading the whole book. It has notes on the side of the page to explain more about what you will be reading. It also has an index where you can look up scripture to read if you are needing help in certain areas of your life. I plan to buy another copy of this book for my best friend."
3,It's okay...,Find it hard to know which book of the Bible you're in because the display doesn't reflect it. Doing this would be much more convenient!
4,Not Searchable,"There is no way to use this bible in church because there is no way to get to the verses or passages without using the TOC. If I have said it once, I have said it 1000 times. Amazon should NOT produce or sell a bible for kindle without DIRECT VERSE JUMP!Bibles for the kindle are useless without some quick way of navigating to the verses and passages you want. Otherwise this bible is wonderful."
5,Like very much,Have enjoyed this Bible very much. I enjoy the preview before each book of the bible and the wording makes the Bible real for me. My main criticism is that it is difficult to tell which book of the Bible I am in. Would like to have the name of the book at the top or bottom of the page. It is not too difficult to get around in my kindle if I use my back arrows to go to the contents page and moving from scripture that is highlighted in blue and then back to where I am reading is a whiz. I enjoy a lot of the writing of this author. He makes the Word of God come alive!
1,I did not receive this item!!,"I have complained several times about not receiving this item. Please check it out for me.Thanks, Ruth Manning"
2,Not very comfortable,"These flip flops, are very cute to look at, but they are not the least bit flexible, they are for lack of a better way to put it stiff, kind of like cardboard."
1,Battery life is horrible,"Can someone start a company called ""we won't screw you"", because these guys did. Volume, reception and battery life are garbage rated at best. I am really surprised. This will be the first time I have left a cell phone company. I am saying goodbye to Verizon for not taking this back, telling me how great the phone was and not giving me a discount on a replacement phone...only new customers. Well I am a new customer, just no longer theirs. By verizon."
4,My dog smells of oil,"Great little phone! My major complaint --- it's hard to hear the person on the other side no matter how high I turn up the volume. I love the voice activated dialing feature - great when in the car. No need to train it to your voice, either. But the computer voice within the phone (volume) is also very low and no way to make it any louder so its often hard to hear especially in the car. Forget it if you're calling from a loud place.I have no use for the picture taking abilities or video clips or to download ring tones so those features are wasted on me, but it's nice to have the ability should I ever wish. Overall a great phone so far I just wish LG made the volume features all around louder. I have no idea how someone with hearing problems would cope."
3,Good Phone,"This phone is exactly what I expected and in very good shape. My only concern is, the battery life. I have to charge the phone every night."
2,Needs More Work,"Upon first look my LG seemed to be the perfect phone for my needs. It felt sturdy and, had alot of nice functions with it.However, the reception is horrible. I breakup or drop customer calls all the time driving while driving thru the city. Everyone knows how frustrating that is. And I know it's not Verizon because my previous phone worked great in those areas.Also, the camera resolution is awesome at 1.3 megapixels but, there is a one second delay from the time you press the ""Take"" button to the actual photo. This results often in blurred photos or you actually miss what you were taking a picture of.Thirdly, the programs you can buy with the phone to upload music or photos to your computer just does not seem to work. Often you have to reinstall the programs just to get the program to work one time!Overall, to me this was a phone with great potential with dissapointing results. I'm going in Monday to buy another phone."
1,LG stands for Little Good!!,I thought this phone was great for about 2 months! I have had it almost 2 years now and There is very little good to say about it. I am on my third battery and it is on its way out. I am on my second charger. I would neverbuy another LG phone! My whole family has different Lg models and they all have the same problem.
3,Great phone...until it breaks,"This phone was a little bulky but had fabulous features, particularly the removable memory, great picture quality, comfortable controls, and good speakers (as phones go) that could play mp3s. Then, after 15 months of trustiness, the part of the phone where the charger plugs in was somehow bent or broken and would no longer accept a charge. I had it insured, so for the $50 deductible they sent me a new one. Three months later, the same part of the brand new phone broke off. So if you do purchase the 8100 (which has since been replaced by the slimmer sleeker 8300), do not touch it or breathe on it while it is plugged in."
4,vx8100 cell phone,"My wife has this phone wont let itgo,this replacementis better then the one we have works great and serivce was excellent. Thanks for everything."
4,I bought this for someone because I have this model,I bought my phone used and paid more (and had to buy the battery and charger) so this deal (included battery & charger) was great. Ive had my phone 2 years and its still good. My son lives in the hills so is having some reception problems but his area is difficult anyway. this is a great phone for most people and a wonderful deal from the seller I bought from.
4,The Best I've Had Thus Far...,"I wanted to add a positive review for this phone.I noticed they are all negative.I have had this phone for about a year. I have not had any problems at all with the battery. I did purchase a 2nd battery which I forget to use..If the signal is weak, it's usually where there are a lot of trees...The only issue I have is that I can't figure out the MP3 player...My son downloads stuff just fine with this phone. It can be done without difficulty. I just don't have the time I guess.Overall, I love my phone. If I replace it, it will be to get one with more options like the Verizon En-V."
4,Awesome Toy,"I have always used a Samsung phone they have the Best pictures ever. I got the LG 8100 3 days ago and it is a great phone, all but the camera is not the best or clearest. I love the setup on this phone and the size and weight of it! When you go to take a pic you have to keep it on the item you are taking a picture of or it will mess up. Overall a good phone"
2,Not as advertised,"The MP3 Player is very hard to get to, and the buttons on the front don't work for it (officially it's not an available feature from Verizon, but Menu- 0 - service code 000000 - menu9 - menu16 will take you to a menu that includes the media player.Also, 512MB means MegaBITS, not Bytes, only 32MB are available onboard for your media, and only 2MB of that for ringtones.The voice recorder is not fully enabled, either, and also requires a tedious menu-path to get to, instead of the one-touch button on the outside.The LED ""flash"" works for close-up, but it's more of a flash-light than a ""flash"", and hard to activate/turn off."
3,Okay for features but not a good phone,I have had a model of this phone for about one month. Verizon has replaced my handset because of dropped calls. However in the replacement model still find that that volume is lacking. The voice is still choppy. The stubb antenna is something evil. Either develop a full antenna or an internal antenna. A stubb is just in the way. The features are all gutted by Verizon (And I was told that they have great service). The ringers suck. I guess Verizon wants you to buy from them. I paln to downgrade to a more another phone without all of the features that hopefully gets better reception.
1,Worst LG I have owned.,"This is an excellent phone, when it works. I have had this phone replaced 4 times since I purchased it a little more than a year ago, three times for a faulty ""socket?"" for the earpiece/headset and once for freezing up when trying to use the camera. The earpiece for my latest version was dead, again, two weeks after it was replaced and I just don't feel like going through the hassle of waiting for another new one via Fed Ex. I think it is telling that Verizon stopped carrying this model shortly after I purchased it and every replacement has had to come from the manufacturer itself. I have only owned LG phones prior to this and was satisfied with all my previous models. I may even buy another LG in the future--after adequate research--but this one has done nothing but inconvenience me."
4,"DURABLE, low battey life and reception","In my job as a landscaping contractor, my phones take a beating. My previous Moto E815 was destroyed after 6 months. Im goin on a year with this phone and still no problems. It constantly gets dropped, abused, and almost run over, but always functions great. I love the multi color light outside of it and the SD slot allowing me to add infinite music and ringtones. The battery life on this phone leaves something to be desired, as mine only last for about 1.5 days after a year of use. Also i notice that others with Verizon can get sevice in places I cant with mine. But overall the service is consistent, and this phone has held up great. Full of features and great for those of you like me that have destroyed phones in the past."
2,Good for a year,"Yeah, it was a good phone for a year, great reception, battery life even when I was usnig bluetooth, hence 2 stars. Well, now it drops calls even in places where my wife's old samsung, also from Verizon, picks call without any problem. Battery life is dismal now. Bottom line, I am not sure about Verizon, but it si first and last LG phone I have to deal with."
3,No Broadband!,Don't bother ordering this phone for VCast or Broadband internet unless you live in a really big city. Go onto the support section of Verizonwireless.com and you can click the BROADBAND coverage map. It isn't much! Look for the blueish-gray areas NOT the yellow areas!
5,The Best Phone in the Market,"This is a simply amazing phone. It has a Camera, MP3 player, Bluetooth connectivity, and other bells and whistles.I had a Sony Ericcson phone for a while, but it had issues with keeping connected while driving. This phone, so far, had no problems with getting disconnected in NYC/New Jersey Area.Compared to other phones in the market, this is probably the best phone you are going to have.Verizon service was amazing also. I had it activated today and ported my old cell phone number from cingular within 2 hours."
3,Not as good as Motorola,"Went through two of these from Verizon. Tried using three different headsets at highway speeds and could not hear my callers. My previous Kyocera did not not have this problem. Bluetooth range was poor and the connection noisy. My bluetooth headset was not the cause as it is clear on other devices.Not a business tool for sure. Good voice dialing system and command program. Twin speakers goofy looking.Returned both 8100's. Replaced them with a Motorola E815. Clear bluetooth and more than enough volume at highway speeds when using headsets. They've been making cell phones for a long time. LG is a newcomer. Go for Motorola. It simply works.I'm also quite wary as to why Verizon is hawking the 8100's so hard, and downplaying the Motorola, this concerns me.bpAlso..major note here! Once you switch to an E911 type of phone, you can never go back to a non-E911 phone! I found this out when wanting to go back to my older Kyocera and V. would not let me citing FCC rules. Whatever."
3,"Audio and Video go out of sync, Reboot upon REWIND","UI look and feel is very good. Looks like the same effort was no put in building a stable video streaming client.I've been using verizon's VCAST service on this phone for the past 3 weeks. On some clips, Audio and video go out of sync few seconds after starting the playback. And it is really annoying to watch video clips without Sync.On many video clips, REWIND operation crashes the phone and results in auto-reboot. Sometimes I had to do manual reboot.Doesnt look like a stable video streaming productCamera picture quality is not so good."
5,GREAT BOOK,"My friend gave me this book for Christmas. At first, the book didn't look appealing but after reading the first page, I was hooked! If you like lord of the rings, you'll for sure love this book. If not, you'll enjoy the actions, the suspense, the stories, plots. The stories unfolds in such an exciting way. Every page will make you wanna read more. 320 pages....yeah right...it seemed to me like I read only like 100....i want more! This book is great! I loved it a lot. You shoudl read it too, I'll bet you enjoy it too! Email me back on what you think! lilaznboy4ever@yahoo.com"
5,Fred Saberhagen at his best,"The story is placed in the (future/past?)in a rather backward society. Various super high tech masks were created in the deep past that give the wearer superpowers modeled after various ""gods"" of earth's past.""Valhalla"" (Nordic heaven) is not all it seems to be up close. Is something amiss? Norse myth is the backdrop of of a story of adventure and danger. Saberhagen's book has just the right amount of humor, the characters are likable, and the story moves along at a good pace.It is a very good read."
4,My K Class Loved This Book,"Every year a leprechaun visits my classroom. This year she/he left this book. The kids loved it. They felt sorry for the dog and predicted what might happen between the unlikely pair. We talked about the leprechaun's demeanor and feelings. The thing that i heard about most with this book was that ""Lucky,"" the dog, was a girl! This is a very big deal with 5 & 6 year-olds...especially the girls! This book is perfect for St. Paddy's units or getting in the mood for the holiday and talk of wee folk. The illustrations are charming as well."
1,Were they serious?,"Yet another awful kids' book. No story, no plot, cheesy illustrations, no moral. Just mindless. If you care for your kids, get them something with meaning, not this rainy day junk."
1,Beyond obsession/Lovers & Liars,"It seems to be a bootleg DVD, Blurry images, terrible terrible! sound......Both movies are good but.......not on this double sided version DVD."
5,What more could you ask for?,This is about all the BEE GEE's you can handle.It's a great product and if you want a greatest hits disc then get this one.
3,Hmm... Maybe the 'Second-Greatest 'Hits Album.,"If you're a die-hard Bee-Gee's fanatic and already have all of their original LP's on vinyl, 8-track, cassette and CD, this is probably the ablum for you, BUT for everyone else, there are at least TWO MAJOR SORE-SPOTS with this album:""Emotion"" - this remake isn't completely awful, but despite more than 20 years since I've heard the original, that was absolutely better.""Islands in the Stream"" - this remake-version is almost painful to listen to.This album's got most of the great hits that I was really looking forward to (like ""Guilty"" with Barbara Streisand), but it's also got these recent remakes which make me want to commit hara-kiri on my inner ear organs. I wish some artists over 50 would show a little more respect for their younger, druggier, and better glory days."
4,"If you love the Bee Gees, get it.","CDs are almost outdated now. You can download specific songs off the internet for a couple of bucks. But if you are old school like me, buy it."
5,Exellent replacement,"During an RV vacation last summer, our RV broke down, and was in a shop for 31 days, causing us to miss our entire vacation. After picking up our repaired unit, we discovered all our favorite CD's which were kept in a case had disapired. We had collected these through the years, and thought we would never find them again. What a wonderful surprise to find Bee Gees Their Greatest Hits The Record in excellent condition and brand new. I will not hesitate to order from Amazon.com if I find more of our lost CD's."
4,"a beauty, 1970's to the present","an attractive item. love red. just wish there were more songs released on this package. imports contained a few extra tracks. why not the U.S.***** enjoy.*********p.s. no need to edit ""to whom the bells may toll"".****"
2,Beware of New Versions of Old Songs,I was disappointed by new versions of Islands in the Stream and Heartbreaker versions that appear on this CD. I was hoping to hear the originals with Dionne Warwick and Dolly Parton.
2,Too small to be called a coloring book,This is very small and hard for little hands to color in yet alone keep it open. I do not recommend this coloring book at all. My Toddler looked at it and threw it on the floor. I will stick with traditional coloring books. Hey I can go to the dollar store and get one much better than this one. Disappointed
2,Price says it all,"The book is a mini coloring book. Has the ABC's in it. This def. Shows the meaning you get what you pay for. It was 1.50 I feel I should of paid .75 for it. But my son will color in it, all that matters."
1,small coloring book,I thought the coloring book was normal size but it was like pocket size.Fast delivery though.
3,Read the dimensions!,"While this has great illustrations, make sure you read the dimensions before you buy it! It came today and I was totally surprised that it's about 5 inches tall. I like it, and we'll use it, but I should have followed my advice. ;)"
2,It's more of a flip book,This book is really hard to color in because it's so small and the pages don't lay flat. It's more like a picture book than a coloring book because of that. I do like this one better than the dinosaur one because the pictures are more interesting.
3,"Ok, but small","I was surprised by the size of this coloring book, it's very small, and I think for little kids it's more difficult to draw on such a small surface.But overall for the price that's not to bad."
1,I hated it,"I didnt even watch the whole thing.. the picture looks hot, but its narrated by 70-80yr olds and it was so boaring I didnt even watch most of it. I do not recomend it to anyone.... unless you were a member of the club"
3,amusing interlude,"About all I can think of to say about this is that every generation seems to think it invented sex or discovered it for the first time. Orgies are as old as ancient Rome, and probably older than that, even. OK if you're bored and at a loss for something to do."
3,It's like watching your parents *yuck*,ChickenRibsChow MeinLasagnaMeatballsPotato SaladMacaroniCole SlawCold CutsDid I say chicken?
3,American Swing,An insight into the swing movement. A documentary on Larry Levinson and his eventual downfall. It was just OK. So-so.
2,Too much blabla,The cover is Totally misleading. Content is a bunch of bla...bla from old people who share miserable experiences.Absolutely not what expected.
2,Disapointing,"I don't know why this movie is marked as an NC-17 movie, is it because there are some nude frontal photos of both sexes flashed on screen for a couple seconds? This movie is at best rated R."
1,Don't waste your time,Good thing I didn't spend much money on this junk. A documentry about free love in the 60's and 70's. I never even finished watching it. What a waste of time.
2,American Swing,Did not like this movie at all. Not my kind of viewing. Some may enjoy it. I did not like it.
3,Disappointed,"I anxiously awaited the new version of the survey. In the past it has proved to be invaluable in purchasing commentaries. Unfortunately I was disappointed. Not much new work has been done. Many of the comments will sound annoyingly the same...because they are! If you have a previous version save you money and wait for Glynn, he seems to make an effort to stay on top of the publishing world.I'm disappointed that Carson's name is on this one, I expect more. Either a grad assistant did most of the work or the publisher needed sales.On the bright side, if this is the first time you've used this survey it is indispensable."
3,Where's the beef?,"At $14 a pop, it seems like alot of money for what appears to be 20 pages of new comment. Carson would have been much better off culling all the comment on commentaries nobody cares about any more and putting it to good use describing in more detail those that do. Longman does a much better job covering new stuff (though misses some new ones), plus is organized much better."
3,Not for the beginner,Really was not what I was looking for..wanted a basic to better understand the New Testamentthis was not enough scriture and too much detail
4,Great overview for Bible Students,Read this before you buy commentaries. Geared towards buying a couple or more per book so it can get expensive fast if you are not careful.
5,The go to guide,New Testament Commentary SurveyThis is a must have for the serious commentary purchaser. For the Bible student that is interested in researching the best commentary for a specific book of the New Testament this survey is invaluable. I have used the 4th and 5th edition and now I am using the 6th edition and I refer to it often. The comments are brief yet clear enough to be able to make an informed decision. And with these reviews and recommendations coming from a scholar at the level of Dr. Carson they can certainly be trusted.
5,A Must Have Resource!,"D.A. Carson has done a wonderful job with this book. Search online, or just go to your local Christian bookstore and to see all the available commentaries is just mind numbing. They are also so expensive. But in this book Carson reviews most of the commentaries out and tells you what is good, and what you should avoid. A awesome resource to save you money and to build a awesome library."
2,confusing,"I hate to contradict other reviews, but I found the layout of this little book confusing and cluttered.Over the past few years I have found the list from Macarthur's book on preaching to be helpful to the conservative preacher.Detroit Baptist Theological seminary has a useful pdf on the pastors library as well."
5,Excellent Caribbean travel guide for rum lovers!,"A great resource for the rum lover planning a trip to the Caribbean. The brief introduction to the history of rum and its distillation process can serve rum enthusiasts and neophytes alike to better understand and appreciate this wonderful spirit.The book is divided into sections, each one dedicated to one of the Eastern Caribbean Islands. Within each section, readers will find a complete listing of the local distilleries, along with pictures of the labels produced and a brief descriptions of what makes the particular rums unique.While some rum connoisseurs may be disappointed by the lack of detailed tasting notes for each rum, they will certainly be delighted by the otherwise generous amount of rum-related information for each island, such as distillery tours and rum shop locations."
2,Shojo Space Opera... Er...,"An ambitious full-length feature, Toward the Terra is intelligent, well-animated, and rather boring. Don't misunderstand me - I like cranial anime, but the plot here fails to keep one's attention, and meanders too much to be effective. And I never thought I'd say this about anime, but Toward the Terra is just too long. 112 minutes to tell a story that could have been over in 75. Character development is inadequate, and the extremely shojo (girls' manga) character design is tiresome, and the music is awful - even though I like J-pop. Then again, this could just be 19-year old animation showing its age. On the plus side, the animation is fluid if drab, the revelation of the psychics' purpose is interesting, and TRSI is selling this for $5 now. If you like melodramatic space opera, and especially if you like classic anime, give this a shot, but I personally reccomend Gall Force in that category."
3,Touching Stories,"There were many touching stories in this book. I will say it wasn't what I expected. I had read Jesus Freaks and was expecting much of the same. Though it wasn't a bad book, it just wasn't one of my favorites. It will certainly remind you how good you've got it."
1,Dishonoring to God!,Complete rubbish and dishonoring to God. Listen to your children's music before you give them something that can most definitely make your child question their faith or teaches lies about God!I was going to post lyrics off some of the tracks but I noticed I was wasting to much time searching for them. Shouldn't they be freely and easily accessible? Especially for children's music...If still in doubt take this cd to your Pastor and see what their views are. You can listen to it for free on pandora before you buy it.
3,Ok for very short time,"My 6 year old got bored with this game after about 15 minutes. He still plays it frequently, but only for very short periods. If you are looking to keep kids entertained for a long drive or something, pick something else!"
4,"Giant door stop, gets the job done","This thing is HUGE! We were going to use it for a front door that is about 2 1/2 inches off the floor when it clears the threshold. But this is bigger than we wanted. Still, we are keeping it. It proves handy for other things. Somehow, we just didn't appreciate how big it really would be. Think hockey puck on a stainless steel post. And there isn't a way to permanently attach it to the floor. But we are using it in unexpected ways, like a door weight to hold a door open. It's plenty heavy, movable, and we like it. Four stars only because, for those who want a door stop, it ought to attach permanently, and doesn't."
3,OK,"Yes, it stops the door. No, it doesn't hurt too much when I kick it. No, my cats haven't figured out how to move it, although this is only a matter of time.It's awkwardly large, though. And since you're spending a boatload more than you need to in order to have something that looks nice, that's a big deal"
2,Too Bad!,"I was so excited when I saw these door stops because anything I had used before did not hold our office doors open. When I received them in the mail, and felt how heavy they were, I thought for sure they would work!Unfortunately, they did not hold the door open without another rubber stopper stuck under the door, so now I have to use both."
3,Not the best,"When I got this book I knew it was from 1991,but there were pictures in from 1985 it left me with the feeling it was an old book .The overall feeling of this book was that there was a lot of good info about the kennels in the U.S.A.but the lay-out is in my opninion not so good.So overall 3 stars for the book!"
5,Native American Music Awards,"Center of the Universe, my personal favorite, has just been nominated by the Native American Music Awards in the catagory of Best Instrumental. It's a wonderful blending of traditional flute music and etheral keyboards, taking you on a journey to the Center of the Universe and bringing you out in a higher place. A perfect CD for meditation!"
2,A lack of objectivity,"I couldn't get past page 100. By then I had lost any hope that the author possessed the objectivity necessary to produce a worthwhile history of his subject. Constant repeated superlatives about any and all aspects of the Nez Perce or of his primary historical figure became monotonous. For example, in his description of the arrival of Lewis & Clark, he extols the nobility of the Nez Perce while describing a council meeting that, but for the intervention of one women, would have decided to murder the visitors in their sleep. This all too common tendency to see tribal life as an unspoiled and innocent Eden takes this author over the edge of credibility."
1,Troy Bilt ain't wat It used to be,"I have owned Troy Bilt products for 30 years.Sprayers, mowers, and the like.Loved them all.They were well built and went on year after year after year.I had a Troy Bilt Tomahawk Chpper that I had used for 25 years before it gave out.I has heard Troy Bilt's quality had taken serious hits but bought this unit anyway.BIG Mistake.It jams repeatedy, it is poorly engineered and if you have more than a modest amount of chipping or shredding to do, you are going to be at it a long long time with this piece of junk.No more Troy Bilt for meGry Hutchinson"
1,me too,"This chipper was fine for a while. Then, when loading leaves into the chute, my wife accidently included a small piece of a branch - no more than one inch in diameter and two inches long. That destroyed the machine. It came apart internally as described by the other buyer - the clamp came off and a blade came loose badly damaging the flywheel. It is nearly $300 for a replacement flywheel. Then, shortly after repairing that, the engine literally exploded when the engine case cracked open throwing bits of case and oil everywhere. A replacement engine is around $500.The engine case is about as thin as cardboard and looks like it's made of cheap sphelter. That's not to mention having to replace the oil seal after only a year of operation. If it was made of materials that could stand the strain of real work and if the spares were reasonably priced it would be OK; but as it is, it's an expensive lesson in modern junk manufacture."
1,Briggs & Stratton Engine the downfall,"I was looking forward to using my new Troy-Bilt Shredder. I read all the instructions, followed them, put in the oil and then the gas. The gas started coming out the air-filter in a stream. I pulled to cord to rotate the engine 1/4 a rotation and gas started coming out the muffler. I returned the machine for a full refund. I wasted the better part of a day with pick-up and returning the unit. I had my sights on getting a rototiller after using the shredder. Forget that. Does anyone do an inspection before shipping and selling equipment anymore?"
2,A lot of nothing,"This is nothing more that a numerical listing of a bunch of ideas about how to improve chapter relations. The list is not in any particular order and has a lot of stuff that is not unique to chapter relations but is just plain old common sense, such as, ""Respond to chapter inquiries right away to show commitment.""Certainly not worth $5.95 or even $2.95. If it was 99 cents I might say it is worth having for the few good ideas that are in it. But frankly this is one of the worst purchases I've ever made on Amazon."
5,"Great Menu Ideas, Tailor Your Own Diet",This book is excellent in helping people to tailor a diet that helps them cope better and live a more full life. Great menu ideas too.
5,How to Write More Books.,"First-rate little book filled with erudition, wit and deep respect for good writing. The author knows how to make every word and punctuation mark count. Highly recommend to anyone who cares about writing. This book, HOW NOT TO WRITE, is, however, a re-issue of Mr. Safire's 1990 book FUMBLERULES. Both are equally good, because they are the same book. I purchased Fumblerules used here on Amazon for a tiny price. Buy the new one here, too. You'll be glad to have either version."
4,Fun romp through the thornier parts of grammar,"William Safire, of course, is a master of the English language. In ""How Not To Write,"" Safire attempts in a humorous way to lead the reader through the thornier thickets of grammar. To a large extent he succeeds, demonstrating proper and improper grammar throug humorous example.A worthwhile addition to the library of anyone who writes. The only problem I see is trying to remember all the rules when you really need them . . . like when you're writing.Jerry"
2,"Great bluesman, weak cd.","No, Willie Foster was not just one blues-harp player among many others ; he was an amazing bluesman, a great harmonica player, and a wonderful singer, with that complaining voice that goes straight to your heart. But his life full of trouble (misery, prison, psychiatric hospital, etc.) never allowed him to lead the musical career he could have had. Finally, he only recorded some 45's in the fifties, and 5 cds at the end of his life : all of them are very good with some gutwrenching moments, but this one is very weak : Willie couldn't be bad, but the sound is poor, and the production is awful. Try any other cd from Willie, except this one."
2,One of many...,"Little Willie Foster was one of the many second or third rank blues players who somehow became ""legendary"" once the real legends had all died off. Not to say that his music isn't enjoyable, but there are many CDs out there by guys just like him, and almost none of them have anything to offer that differentiates them from one another. Foster's music might best be described as a somewhat watered down mix of Howling Wolf and Sonny Boy Williamson #2. If you're looking for truly original and/or important harp blues, buy a CD by Junior Wells, James Cotton, George ""Harmonica"" Smith, Sonny Boy Williamson #2, Big Walter Horton, or Little Walter. If you've got all those and you're looking for the next best thing, get a CD by Carey Bell, Billy Branch, Kim Wilson, Rod Piazza, or William Clarke. If you've already got all those and are still digging deeper, pick up something by Easy Baby, Little Arthur Duncan, Raful Neal, Johnny Dyer, Wild Child Butler, or this guy, Willie Foster."
4,An Invaluable Employee Resource,"This book has been an invaluable resource to me in the months since I first received it....It's come in very handy in a couple of small instances in my workplace. Sad as it is to say, there are always going to be companies that are out to cheat their employees, or companies that take advantage of their employees out of ignorance of the labor laws. This book has backed up my opinion on more than one occasion. Anyone working for a company that they don't quite feel is looking out for their best interests needs to have this book in their library."
4,Detailed,"If you are having specific problems with an employer, this book is probably a must-read. But as background on a subject that you might feel you should know something about (as in my case), it's a slow and not exactly gripping treatment of a complex topic. Treat it as a reference book, not an introduction. Note also that laws change in this area (typically every 4 or 8 years), so the book is going to date itself quickly. All things considered, buy it if you have a specific need."
3,Just the Basics,"This guide is presented for use to an employee, most probably someone who has a workplace issue occurring, though I believe it would be most useful for anyone within Human Resources.It is a guide, therefore it is not an exhaustive reference. Major points are offered, but details are lacking. Each person's circumstance is not the typical case, so judgement or follow-up guidance may be necessary.The guide is lacking in the way of religious issues. Only one page was dedicated to the topic. I also had more questions about business trip related issues. Just the basics were covered.Most of the topics that vary state to state have summaries with the details and a reference address to the states' legal code.For your further research, the guide instructs you to subscribe to Nolo's legal updates as well as check out [...]."
4,excellent reference and just plain interesting reading,I love this book. It explains a lot of things that some of us in the workforce have probably wondered about at sometime or the other. For instance- why are some salaried individuals excempt from being paid overtime?. Answer is in the book. Part of keeping the workplace fair is knowing your rights and this book does a very good job of telling you what your rights are as a working in general. Of course its not a law encyclopedia and different states have different laws but this book does a good job of hitting a lot of points. From a writing perspective it is fairly engaging and not hard to get through considering the subject matter.I highly recomned this book if you are at all curious about what your rights in the workplace are.
4,Handy reference,"I'm sure you could look up all the things in this book on-line, but to have it all in one handly reference guide is great.I work in an office that recently voted to unionize because we didn't like the way we were treated. We weren't being paid fairly. This book spells out exactly what is legal and illegal when it comes to paying for breaks and overtime. It took the Department of Labor coming in to sort out our place, but maybe if we had waved this book under the boss's nose it would have happened sooner!"
5,Made a Christmas,"Once you get over your initial shock, e.g. the realization that the world was crying out for a 12"" Zuckuss and Lucasfilm responded to that call with, well, a 12"" Zuckuss, you can't go wrong with this guy. His partner 4-LOM is floating around too, along with Dengar and Bossk and the ubiquitous Boba Fett, so you too can live the dream and make your coffee table or computer desk the bridge of the Executor. Highly detailed - the kind of thing you can brandish at unsuspecting friends and make them jump, actually - and this made my brother's Christmas, which probably tells you more about my brother than anything else, but truly, an excellent product and one far better than you'd expect given Zuckuss' relative obscurity in the Star Wars Universe."
3,Dumb Question,"I bought this figure just because I loved the bounty hunters when I was a kid. But in the original star wars, esb and rotj, this figure was refered to as 4LOM. Even the 4"" figure was refered to as 4LOM, But this is refered to by another bounty hunters name, Zuckuss.Is this a fo-pa on hasbro's part? If it is, then this is a unique item to collect.Hey hasbro, if you make 12"" figures this good, you should make another Boba Fett! I WANT A BOBA FETT!!! Good figure, buy it and leave it in the box, or buy two, play with one, and display the other! Kinda hard not to take him out an play with him!"
1,I've read better,I found this info very dry and hard to get thru. I much prefer the writings of Lynn Miller (Work Horse Handbook & Training Workhorses / Training Teamsters) who is actually fun to read.
4,WW2 In-Depth account of Day to Day operations in war,"This book is excellent, sometimes rambling from one person in the story to another, this makes the book seem alive. The story is about a WW2 Infantry Company that is put into combat (green) and looses many men from wounds, cold and combat fatigue. Overall a very realistic and moving book of the realities of war and the interaction of Officer and Men as they fight the European theatre."
1,"Historical piece, not for today's world",I was frustrated with the electronic format. I wanted to be able to look for particular issues and was unable to do it.
3,I've seen some madness before..,"There are very few things in this world that have gotten the best of me. Spike and Mike #5 has ruined me. Some of the scenes are hard to watch unless you are a hardened criminal who has broken out of jail after 12 years and multiple rapes. The beginning clips are pretty tame, but I had to put my head in a vice as the tape played on. Hell- I thought I was sick and twisted. It separates the men from the kids."
3,A GOOD STUDY AID,"This is a good book to aid in enhancing nursing content. It has great memory aid that will help you remember the content. It is a must for nursing students that need that extra help in medical surgial nursing. There is very little on fundamental skills, maternity,pediatric and psychiatric nursing."
5,Hysterical!,"My then-7-year-old daughter received this book for Christmas last year, and even a year later it makes her laugh! As a family of cat owners, we found the book to be as accurate as it is funny. We highly recommend this and any other ""Professor Xargle"" book."
2,Too many beautiful words,"McGuane's overwrought prose was too much for me. I would prefer a few apt, tight metaphors to dozens of cloudy word pictures that leave me wondering ""what is he trying to say?"" Yes, much of the language is beautiful to the ear. And perhaps McGuane frequently intends to create a sense of ambiguity. But reading McGuane reminded me of fishing with a guy who likes the sound of his own voice but isn't sure why he's talking. After a while it is grating.I'm not looking for a mock-Hemmingway style in my angling literature. But McGuane gives us so... many... words."
4,Great product for the price,"I used four of the jacks as leveling jacks on my small travel trailer. I had to modify them to be permanently attached to the frame of my RV. They are sturdy and work well for my purpose. If you simply want them as a car jack for changing a tire I believe they will suffice. The max. height extension is limited (about 18"" - 20"") so keep that in mind."
4,Excellent white noise,"Just received the 30057 model and have no opinion yet on quality of the product yet, but wanted to comment on quality of fan noise and post the power usage.**Sound Quality**The fan makes a very pleasant soft white noise in a 12x14 room on low -- almost as if intentionally designed to make nice white noise. Medium is about the volume of a standing fan on low. High is still a pleasant ""wooshing"" noise, but would mask a noisy urban environment fairly well. Airflow is released out the top towards the ceiling (i.e. feels like a fan when you hold your hand over it).**Power Draw**Measured using a Kill-A-Watt:Low - 60 wattsMedium - 78 wattsHigh - 91 wattsTurning the ionizer on and off appears to have no measurable change on the power draw."
5,Three Years of Daily Use - Still going strong,"Purchased this a bit over three years ago and use almost daily. Florida tends to have a lot of pollen, dust and other general need for air purifier...plus, I like to use it for the white noise or to remove odor when cooking. Other than replacing the filters every three months - this is a solid unit that works exactly as it's supposed to. After three years it's still going strong. Price was right and absolutely no complaints. Very pleased with the Hunter brand!"
3,Great warranty but noisy On high speeds,"Hunter has the very best service department on the web, but some of there units are noisy this unit is quite on slow speeds but very noisy on high speeds, but if noise is not a problem for you then this is a good product by hunter, but because of the noise I gave this unit three stars.Hepa"
2,Odor,"The humidifier works well. It does its job and is just the right size for a bedroom. However, we are returning this one because of an odor that it puts off when running. We are going to exchange it for the same one and see what happens because we do like this model."
3,Works great out of the box.,Used in a room where people smoke and the filters only held up for about a month. New it worked great but be prepared for replacing the filter often if it is for taking care of smoke.
4,Doris Bodmer (Visa ending 34154),"As with all MC Beaton's Hamish Macbeth stories, it is is the nature descriptions which are so particularly charming. You think you are in the Scottish Highlands with the constant change of weather and the few remarkably lovely days, the stern mountains and the Loch which can be silvery smooth or roaring with fierce waves. All this surrounds Hamish, the lovable and astute detective who wants to live nowhere else but in Lochdubh. I want to take my next vacation in the Highlands (hope I won't get murdered.) Keep writing Mrs. Beaton we love your books."
4,A wry commentary on menopause and a darned good mystery!,"Beaton seems to like to include children in her stories and has created an exceptional one here, twelve-year-old Heather who can raise the power of Celtic gods when needed. This is a wry commentary on the vulnerability of menopausal women (""the men's pause,"" it's called in these pages) and a darned good mystery to boot, which you won't fully appreciate until the very last page!"
5,M. C. Beaton,"Another mystery in a little Scottish town. It will give you a good look at life in a small village. Seems like a postcard place to live, but then someone is found murdered and a mystery has to be solved. Thank goodness we have MacBeth on the job...I like this series."
5,Just What I Needed,"I've recently retired and am looking forward to years of ""re-engaging"" with activities I haven't had time to focus on during all those years of full-time work and rearing children. Get it Together is exactly what I needed to provide essential background information and help me organize all the documentation I want my family to have. Now I can travel and do the things I've been looking forward to without worrying about whether my children will be able to figure out what I would have wanted them to know in case something should happen to me.Get it Together has given me an entree to discuss things with my children and to encourage them to do their own planning for the future."
3,Only problem is with 1st two TR games,"This is a great pack for the price, includes the original first 3 tomb raider games. Only problem is with the original TR and TR2, the cutscenes have no dialogue. This means that you cant hear what the characters are saying. The easiest way to bypass this is to download the cutscenes from [...] and get the story that way. The first two TR games for Play Station don`t have this problem, so if you have the money for it I suggest getting the original TR games for Play Station as there is should be no dialogue issue."
4,Good Toy,My son liked this toy overall... but as he got older his favorite thing to do was to pull if off his high chair. I have a good clear plastic liner that goes on the highchair so it was able to suction pretty good. Even with that he learned to pull it off.. that in itself became the best game for him - to pull until it snapped free. It's a good toy but could be a great toy if the suction could be better. I will say that the suction is better than some other toys with suction that we got and quickly gave away.
4,I like it,"This book is very interesting. It is easy to read and understand. It's like watching a movie and since it is so detailed, it got me on the edge of my seat. Suspenseful."
2,glossy trip through complex terrain,"I read this in a book group and found that I couldn't get any traction with it. Every chapter felt like it was an overview. Somehow, I couldn't really connect with the ideas in the book. They did seem a little glossy, a little too facile and the author had a little of that ""I know"" kind of tone which is off-putting for me.I was looking for text that made me search deep inside or where I said to myself ""Wow"" as I connected some dots that I never had before.This book seems to me like familiar territory for anyone who has lived even a slightly ""examined"" life."
4,A Euro-Western Thriller,"This story would count as a very long THRILLER, if done by Graham Greene. It tells of an endless chase on behalf of wartime Nazis of a prepubescent multi-lingual boy who carries in his head data on hundreds of accounts whose contents have the smell of wealth to the masters of the Third Reich. It is about human intelligence and its foibles: in the boy, his German tormentors and his Daddy--a title which his playboy turned hero biological father earns in spades as he seeks to save his reluctant son not just from Nazis but also from his inner demons.+++It is hard to believe that this is a translation from another language (French) into English. I would go so far as to say that this is the first translated novel I have ever read that does not read like a translation.So kudos all around. This is sheer diversion. Made for a movie serial.The game's afoot!-OOO-"
5,Impossible to put down,"Impossible to put down, this book is indeed a page turner. A fast paced thriller, you soon feel as though you are the hunted child. An avid reader, I found this book by accident and it is my favorite. If you like great stories, read this book! This book could also be a great movie!"
5,Read Read Read Read,This is a superb book! I keep recommending this book to friends. Everyone who ever read it has loved it! I am trying to find a copy of it but it is out of print.
3,16 Songs From 1972 - 1976.,"The first track, The Free Electric Band, is great keyboard driven song, belted out with joy and humour, by some way the best on this CD.Not that far behind is It Never Rains In Southern California, slower than Free Electric Band, but maintaining an interesting story line about a guy trying to make his way in Hollywood.The Peacemaker and Down By the River are reasonably good songs and When I Need You was covered in the UK by Leo Sayer, but I prefer Albert's original recording.99 Miles From LA was also recorded by Art Garfunkel, both versions are OK with me.I/m A Train appears to be a children's song and again it's OK.The Air I Breathe was a big hit for The Hollies in the UK, Albert aquits himself well on this one, I like both versions.However the remainder are not much to write home about, in the end only Free Electric Band and Southern California are totally unmissable."
2,Not much here...,"To me, this book was a waste of money. Not enough info here. There are much better books here to spend your money on. I felt that Shari Thurow's book was much, much, much more informative."
4,Execellent for starters,This is an excellent book for understanding the basics of search engine optimization. The book paid for itself with its advice about registering domain names. My only complaint is I wish the writers used a spell check and grammar check before printing the book.
1,discouraging,"This book offers some of the bare bones about search engine marketing. Some of the information inside it was incorrect before the book was even released.There are a couple decent pointers in this book, but there is an equal amount of misinformation. I would advise trying some of the search engine optimization forums (or the book Search Engine Visibility) instead of reading this.If the basis of your knowledge is outdated half truth, then you have no knowledge. I am extremly disatisfied with this book. I practice search engine optimization for a living and would not be able to live if I followed this book."
1,Air Force Delta,"Take this from guy that owns a PS, DC, N64, and a PC, and played almost every flightsim game out there. To put it nicely this has got to be the biggest piece of junk flight sim ever to be unleashed on an unsuspected gameplayer.Sure it sounds like it wold be an awsome game you get to fly almost every combat plane out there, but the sad thing is that they all feel generic. Another thing the graphics are no better then PS's AceCombat2, and the planes don't do no kind of aerial manuvers.The game is defenetly not a flight sim, and is a bad mockery of an arcade style game.If you're still not convinced do your self a favor and rent it first or better yet wait for a few more months untill Microsoft Combat flight simulator comes out on your dreamcast."
1,Airforce Beta,"Actually, this was the first game I bought for my Dreamcast: as an avid Flight-Sim gamer, I wanted to check my new machine's capabilities right away. Sadly, the game proved to be quite a turn off. It's simply not there, reality wise; evidence of inferior Playstation level graphics are all over the place, especailly in explosion effects; but worst of all, I kept getting stuck in a certain mission, with no way out. Simply put, once you start with this one, it won't take you very long till you start looking around for replacements.Even the music track is horrible."
3,Gets Boring after a while,"If you love flying jets and blowing up things this is a game for you. But the bad part about it is that if you get stuck on one mission, chances are that you will get bored and not want to play anymore. I reccomend renting this unless you love this type of game."
4,awsome game but not the best...,"afd is a pretty cool game, the graphics are awsome espeaseally at close range.but as u play more the levels get much harder than they should be i am still stuck on the 4th mission!ac2(ace combat 2)dosen't have better graphics (it's for ps1) but the levels are a little easier so i actually beat the game. but afd is still an awsome game if you are good at speed flying taking down planes in 5 hits instead of the usuall 3 (on some levels) then you should get this game."
1,Worst Flight Sim game I have ever played,"The only reason this even got to the shelves was because it came out early for the dreamcast. One year from now, this will be one of the forgotten games for the dreamcast...Awful."
1,This Game is very hard,This game is very hard for kids under 9 years old the targets are hard to see and they are very small. And your choice of guns are very small.
2,"Fun, but nothing new",the game is fast paced and fun. there are many aircraft to choose from and the ability to buy your favorites is a nice feature. the game never bogs down it is action all the way. unfortunatly where the game does lack is in deapth. if you have played bogey dead six or ace combat series then you will notice that there really is nothing new. they are all basicly the same game. the mission breifs could have been a bit better as well. the graphics are good but not anywhere near the level that the dc can produce. but it was fun and i enjoyed playing it. if you liked the others you will like this one.
3,A decent game but lacking in any real originality,"This game reminds me of the old Afterburner game for Nintendo, but with better graphics. It is simple to play and enjoyable for waisting 15 minutes, but there is nothing here to make you want to beat the game. The levels are all basic shoot the target, don't get shot down. The planes all look nice but the lack of decent computer AI makes the various statistics redundant. The only reason to buy this game is the lack of any better combat flight sim for the DC."
5,One of the best air-combat game I've ever seen!!!!,"This game is very easy to pick up and play. The power of the Dreamcast is fully demonstrated with Air Force Delta. After finishing a mission, the player can review the whole combat scene from start to finish. The replay shows all angle of air combat. It's like an animatd movie. This is a must see and a must buy!!"
5,I love this game!,"I love playing this game, yeah I would have love playing it with take-offs and Landings but it still loads of fun."
5,"Not the best Dreamcast game, but still a fun shooter!","If you are looking for an accurate flight simulator, then don't look here. However, if you want an enjoyable 3-D shooting game where you strap yourself into a cockpit and Go Downtown, look no further!"
2,Very little booty,"The women are attractive but the show is very poorly directed. If you are fan of butt shots,this is not the tape for you.Hot Body has really gone down hill over the past several years.One thing that is still certain is that John Cross loves the sound of his own voice.Who wants to here him talk while a women is undressing for the camera."
4,Good Read,This book is a wonderful way to learn or re-examine your preaching calendar. There are a lot of helpful tips and several plans to help you get started.
4,Violence Prevention,Accessible. Well structured. Using it as one of our resources as we develop a policy and guidelines for reducing violence against healthcare workers.
2,Barely any coverage for First Gen Models,This book mostly covered 2nd generation camaros and up. Not recommended for anyone looking for a 1st generation guide. Almost no information on interior restoration for 1967 camaros.
2,This book tells you nothing.,"This chiltons ""total car care"" doesn't tell you how to dissasemble or reassemble anything with any detail at all."
2,Dissapointed....,"I was so excited when I received this book. However that all changed once I began reading it. I have read many books on Autism and this one was by far the worst one I have read. I felt the writer dragged the chapters out. I was hoping this book would provide a lot of information on the sensory issues in autism, instead it just gave each sensory issue its own chapter without really explaining anything. This book is less than 200 pages long, it could have been written in probably 60 pages. I do not recommend this book. It is very boring and uninformative. Read ""The World of the Autistic Child"" or ""Facing Autism"", you will enjoy them a lot more and get more information and they cost a lot less too."
1,Why I stopped reading Sci Fi,"I purchased this book after hearing O'Leary's poem on the car commercial. While the poem was mediocre, it did provide a certain haunting quality I thought I'd find in the author's books.Unfortunately, that one poem was probably his best work. This book is an example of why I quit reading Sci Fi in the 70's. It reads like a bad nightmare (and I don't mean a nightmare that is so real it is scary - I mean a nightmare from which you wake up and go ""HUH?"").There is no real discernable plot in this book. It shows no imagination whatsoever on the part of the author. The author substitutes the shock-value of vulgarity, in actions and language, for plot and character development. It provided no comedic relief, no real drama or pathos, and left me not caring what happened to the characters.Someone here compared it to HHGTTG by Douglas Adams. No way! Douglas Adams provides class-act comedy. O'Leary doesn't even approach the level of Three Stooges comedy."
5,"Wonderful story! Entertaining, thought-provoking!","Loved this book! I stayed up 'til 2:00am just to finish reading it, and I didn't want it to be over. Great suspense, superior plot management, content that is both clever and wise (Sounds corny - but I wouldn't say it if I didn't think it was true).I love books that TEACH as they entertain, and this book does that very well... It's meaty, has lots of ideas, packed with observations, theories, content. Real content.The writing style is quick, witty, fast-moving, conversational, natural-sounding - you really have to stay with it, you really learn Patrick O'Leary's ""voice"" - but it's easy and fun and really engaging.Highly recommended!"
2,A puzzling work of SF,"I looked forward to ""Door Number Three"" after reading the jacket cover. I like SF that plays on issues of time and alternate realities and the like. This book was not at all what I hoped for. Mr. O'Leary writes well and fluidly. His story has a staccato quality that must attempt to highlight the discontinuities of reality that he explores. For me, the result was a book that was difficult to ""get into."" The main character is appealing. This was not the case for the others, including the mysterious woman from an different plane of reality. The ideas are interesting, and the writing is crisp. The story execution falls short, however."
4,3 Light Vanity Fixture,"Got this yesterday and when I opened it today everything was okay. It doesn't have screws to attach the plate to your junction box, nor does it come with light bulbs. I used 8/32 screws for the box, and the bulbs are regular base screw in types.It goes up easy enough and looks good. The color is more wrought iron black in my opinion. The light shades are pretty heavy duty and I think they really add to the appearance of this light. I put in the equivalent of 60 watt bulbs and it was just right for the 1/2 bath this went in."
5,Man Made: A Memoir,"I could not put this book down. The writing is superb, the story truly amazing. What an incredible story told so well."
4,"For a good time, dial EFO","The problem with reviewing a band like Eddie From Ohio is that I am forced to try and describe the music in relation to bands you might have heard of, and this isn't fair to an outfit as creative and original as EFO. Is it pop? Is it folk? Is it serious music? Is it ""gimmick"" music? The answer is (e) All of the above. EFO hails from Virginia and plays a great blend of folk-ridden pop... or pop-ridden folk that features some of the sharpest, cleverest, wittiest lyrics you'll hear these days. The songs range from very funny (Stupid American, Eddie's Concubine) to deeply moving (Minnesota 1945, Twenty Thousand Hearts) and everything in between you never thought someone would write a song about. It's sort of like the Beautiful South... without the bitterness... and sounding completely different. Imagine XTC... from Virginia. Anyway, despite a couple of musically nondescript tracks, the overall quality is high and the mood is upbeat and fun. For a good time, dial EFO."
2,Not user-friendly,"If you are planning to use this book as a tutorial for an extended stay in Italy, then this book just might be helpful. However, if you want to use it as a simple phrase book AND as a dictionary, it is completely frustrating. Even the most basic words are not located in the dictionary section (most likely because there were included somewhere else in the book). Thus, if you need to quickly look up a word, it is incredibly annoying to sift through all of the sections of the book to figure out where that particular word might be defined."
4,Great for almost all needs,"Having this book in Italy really improved my experience and my Italian. It is great from the English to Italian standpoint, but for translating Italian back to English, you still really need an Italian-English/English-Italian dictionary along with you. The nice thing about this book is its small size. It fits nicely into your pocket and you can leave your dictionary in a backpack for less frequent uses. The best tip I can give is this: when you're interacting with locals, just try and muddle through, ignoring the phrases you don't remember. Then, afterwards, go back and find the phrase you needed. It'll be more likely to stick with you then."
2,Not So Great,"This is supposed to be a historical romance, but it doesn't really read that way at all. The setting isn't drawn realistically at all, and there are really only a few references to how life was in the 1900s. You can easy tell that the setting wasn't well-researched and that N.R.'s attempt to drawn a mental picture of the 1900s fails miserably. The main characters are thoroughly modern, and I just get the sense that N.R. didn't put too much effort into this book. The love story is cute, but so are a million others that are on the market. There is nothing remarkable about this story and nothing that would have you wanting to re-read it or recommend it to friends. This book was written well before N.R. gained in popularity, so I would skip it in favor of a more recent book of hers."
2,A bit boring,It did not hold my interest. I kept waiting for something more - characters or something different fo happen. Not really a Nora Roberts type of book.
5,Awesome story!,Totally did not expect a story like this from Nora. Kept me hooked the whole time. I did figure out the bad guy early on but it still kept me riveted. Highly recommend this book and already have!
4,Tugs at the Western Heartstrings,"It's a romance novel, people. Moreover, it's an historical romance novel. Realism is not what this genre is about. It was just believable enough that I enjoyed it. This genre is about fantasy, fairy tale. And every once in awhile, I think it's great to read a novel like this one.It's set in 1875, by the way, not the 1900s. Would there have been Apache stagecoach attacks in 1875? I dunno, but does it matter?One thing that does bother me is Roberts' tendency to involve bruising with sex. Lots of passages where the hero is described as bruising the woman when he gets really aroused. I try to ignore these descriptions, but find them disturbing. I don't think that normal embracing, or even rough caresses, would cause bruising. Is this some kind of weird quasi-rape fantasy? And if so, is this what women want to read?"
3,TOMTOM ONE,"I cant imagine how I ever got along without my TOMTOM all these years, makes traveling fun and is easy to operate. The one draw back is that on this model you have to pay for map updates and that can run into some money."
4,Solid Basic Unit,"This product is so easy to use right out of the box. A lot of bang for the buck in my opinion. Has a lot of great features to make understanding, following, or changing routes easy. May not have the high end toys like blue tooth, mp3, yada, yada, but for those of us who want an easy to use yet economical gps, then the Tom Tom ONE fits the bill."
3,Good but Little cons,"Pros: Good for the value and functionalityCons: The mount cup does not stay on the glss, its keep on fall down."
3,Nice Cool Gadget,"Trying to deal with Mapquest or Google Maps is like driving blind. I've used a few different brands of GPS. Settled for Tomtom after trying it out. Since I dont own a vehicle, I needed something small. It works great. I take it everywhere I need 2 drive. No more trying to read a map while I drive, no more asking how to get to.... I would've given it more stars but;1. the included software is somewhat useless.2. There are some streets not on the unit.3. Not able to upgrade maps unless you purchase entire set.4. Windsheild suction cup not too good (Garmin has a lever to actuate & release it).Otherwise, I cant drive without my Tomtom."
5,Pleased as can be!,This worked right out of the box. Not a single problem. Better than I had expected. Used it on a four-day trip with many stops to look up the day after it arrived in the mail. Very easy to use. Only one out of nearly four dozen destinations gave goofy directions. I found it to be very forgiving of mistakes with nearly instantaneous re-routing. Made frequent use of point of interest database. Absolutely amazing! No need to purchase a more expensive unit; the TomTom One is perfect for me. I'm recommending it to others.
1,horrible product,"I received my item on time, however it was not very user friendly. Plus, I tried to return this item and the seller refused to respond to my request for return. I lost money on this item and ended up purchasing a garmin, which I am very happy with. The TomTom is difficult to navigate. I do not recommend this product...go with a garmin."
4,Tom Tom One - US-Canada,"PROS - Fairly easy to use, very compact. Saved me several times driving in unfamiliar areas - much better than a stressful interchange between girlfriend/navigator stressed driving/boyfriend.CONS - Short battery life 2 hours(unless you plug it into your car), sometimes it can take a while for the device to read the satilites. I think it needs at least three of the nine sats. up there. In cities, sometimes hight buildings can interrupt the signal, but typically during first turning on the device.OVERALL - Good gadget if you do a lot of driving alone in areas unfamiliar to you. Well worth the investment. Best to program your destination before you start driving as the touch screen entering can be a little tedious DURING a drive."
4,Great for the money,Very reliable. Consider the money paid it was a good deal. Besides marking my house 50 feet away from where it really is I have no complains. Used for almost a year and been to lots of places. Great when looking for small restaurant and motels miles away. Plans route accurately.
2,Tom Tom -- Not Not,"At work, we use a Garmin, however, I wanted to give Tom Tom a try and found it to be really not to the standard of the Garmin. In addition, my friend has the Nuvi 350 and we took it on a trip and it was easy to use, good graphics, text to speech is good, just an overall good product. This goes for the Garmin that we have at work.The Tom Tom One that I purchased was really subpar. There is no text to speech with street names. The Tom Tom says, ""In 300 yards, take the next right."" Also, the Tom Tom said their were resturants and hotels at an intersection and there were none to be found. Also, my Tom Tom dropped from my windshield when I was taking a turn. And last, the graphics are not very good. It does not even have my address on the map.I would not recommend the Tom Tom... Spend the extra and get the Garmin Nuvi. Oh, the Tom Tom computer downloads were extremely difficult to work.Hopes this helps,JRKathleen, GA"
5,TomTom,I absolutly LOVE this. I'm a person that isn't good with directions so this helps a great deal. Very easy to use. Just bought 3 more for my family members.
4,Tom Tom One Works For Me,"I fell in love with the GPS after renting a car that used Tom Tom. I'm absolutely in love with my Tom Tom and use it everywhere I go. Even if it's only a few miles down the road. I'm dissappointed that Tom Tom One doesn't say the name of the streets, but I can get over that. I guess the rental car Tom Tom was a different model than the one I purchased. Another disappointment was finding the same Tom Tom One on sale at an electronics store for $50 less a month after my purchase. But again, I'm still happier than anticipated and know I'll never be lost again, literally. I also am impressed with how fast Tom TOm can recalculate detours."
4,very good GPS,"I like following features of TomTom One1. It has intuitive user interface and is easy to use2. It gives the user the choice of A-Z keyboard or QWER keyboard that we are all accustomed to since type writer was invented3. Its 20 channel high sensitivity receiver4. its compact sizeI give it 4 stars because it cannot say the street names, can only say left/right/straight. Also, the map is slightly outdatedAfter the previous review on April 20, I used it for a recent travel to several national parks. In all cases, we arrived at the destinations by following TomTom One. I wish I had bought it earlier..."
3,tomtom one - nice but could be better,"i liked that the tomtom one was ready to go right out of the box. but, i'll highlight what i didn't like or thought could be improved upon because everything else was basically nice and user friendly (especially for first time gps users).1. it needs text-to-speech...it gives approaching distance instead of street names.2. battery life was not very long.3. it gave me some weird routes for destinations to which i knew quicker and better ways to get to.i ended up returning the tomtom one."
5,Rich L,"Great product. Even used it to go to places I've been going to for years. It found a shorter way. Most people, myself included, thought you had to pay a monthly charge for the satelites. Not so. Buy the unit and you're done."
5,I LOVE MY TOMTOM!,"A decade ago I bought the first ever Garmin Street Pilot - no model number because it was the first. It was a neat gray-scale toy, but it did little more than show you where you are and what's around you. It was too much effort to plan your own routes, so we never did. We still have it. We watched as the technology exploded and waited for the prices to fall. Last year we tried a no-name piece of junk that threw temper-tantrums at us if we went a different way, and spent more time crashing and rebooting than navigating. We returned it.This time I did more research, and bought a TomTom. I LOVE MY TOMTOM! It is fast and accurate, and obviously designed by drivers! I refused to by anything based on Windows CE, and although I haven't had it very long yet, TomTom hasn't crashed once. It calculates routes FAST, and recalculates quickly (and without tantrums or U-turns) if we go a different way. It zooms out when you drive faster, and zooms in when you approach a turn. Icing on the cake!"
3,Great GPS. Lousy Maps.,"5 stars for the GPS unit but 2 stars for the maps. I really liked this device...the size, shape, display, and features. Everything worked very well. It was very easy to setup and use right out of the box. But I had to return it. The maps were terrible. High rate of errors for me and it couldn't find half of the places that I was looking for. I wanted to use for VA, MD, DC, and OH areas. Obviously this is a budget GPS system but for the price I expected either more accurate maps or free updates. I went with a Garmin unit instead. It has none of the map issues this unit does. It uses a different set of maps form a different company. I have heard TomTom is going to change over to the same company that Garmin uses."
3,Needs Map Upgrades,"I purchased this unit from Amazon based on the Consumer Reports recommendation. Not a good idea as this unit is no longer being made and the the NA maps included are from 2005(?). I contacted TomTom USA and they told me that new maps for this unit will not be avialble until next year (I wonder if they will still support this edition by then). The cost of updating your maps is about 65% of what I paid for this unit.That being said, I am still able to get around using this GPS. When The unit says to turn on a street that isn't there and I don't turn, it takes about 5 seconds for it to re-figure a route to get where I'm going. I haven't gotten lost yet! It does tend to send a person through the city when I know a bypass would be quicker (not necessarily shorter). If someone wants to start out with their first GPS then I would recommend this unit. Once you get used what these things do and want to upgrade, then by all means do so."
2,Out of Date Maps,"Our old GPS unit died recently. After looking at several models, we ordered the TomTom ONE because of its well-designed interface. When we tried to actually use it, though, we discovered that its maps are hopelessly out of date.Our unit (ordered in August 2007) shipped with the version 665 maps, which are a blast from the past. The end of our street is blocked by a barrier has been there for at least 8 years; our old GPS, a Magellan unit from 1999, knew about the barrier. The ONE, however, thinks that the barrier does not exist and routes us through it every time we try to go to or from the highway. The TomTom also doesn't know about the new entrance to the San Jose Airport. And that's just from our first hour of usage!TomTom sells updated maps, but they cost 99 euros -- more than half the price of the unit itself! Needless to say, we returned the unit.Skip the TomTom ONE and go with a newer model. Or do what we did and buy a Garmin instead."
4,TomTom One GPS,"This product is amazing! I took TomTom ONE Portable GPS Vehicle Navigation System on a business trip with me and it easily found my client's location. The only minor problem I found was that it may be off by one or two buildings. I'm not sure if it is a software update issue or just the accuracy of the tracking satellites, but it is fantastic. Especially the audio feature that talks you to your destination without having to look at the screen while you are driving. The volume even increases automatically the faster you drive. It also gives you plenty of warning when your turn is coming up. I recommend this to anyone who travels to places unknown."
1,TomTom One is an old model,"TomTom One is an OLD model. In Europe and elsewhere the TomTom One has been replaced with the TomTom One NE or New Edition. It is lighter, thinner, and all evaluations in Europe agree: it is better!There are two TomTom One NEs in Europe: ""TomTom One Regional"" (with a SD card of the country of choice, e.g., the UK) and ""TomTom One Europe"" (with a SD card of Europe). The latter is more expensive than the former.Wait! The new TomTom One will appear in the USA eventually. March '07? April? May?"
2,not really worth it,"I bought TomTom one which looked fabulous. But I got real bad experience with it. Showing wrong destination time and not able to connect to phone by bluetooth. Tried couple phones none of them able to connect to the GPS. And more over typical driving direction, which took me 2 & a 1/2 hours travelling time where it should supposed to be 1 & a 1/2 hour. So I strongly suggest to check one more time before you go for it."
4,Good product,"The TomTom ONE does what it needs to do most of the time. New routes are calculated quickly when you miss a turn, without letting you turn around.There are a few minor gripes about routing sometimes, but on the whole it works well and correct about 98% of the time."
1,avoid tom tom support,This is a decent product but if at any time you need to deal with TomTom support pay the extra money and buy another brand. They are defint. extremely bad.
5,AWESOME,"We just moved to a new city and my wife was out and about the first day. The display is great, turn by turn spoken directions are awesome and it is really quick. The connection to the satellites is really fast and we have yet to lose it anywhere.If you are moving to a new city, it is a great co-pilot. I highly recommend it."
3,I paid too much!,"I ordered this GPS for my husbands birthday. He was very thrilled. We opened the box on November 14th and the next day everyone started running these same GPS at almost $90 cheaper in some cases. I was very disappointed! It's working fine so far, but sad to say this amazon deal, wasn't a deal!"
5,completely happy not sorry to have purchased this product,This is a good gps and i like that the maps are on an sd card and not preloaded. My friend has an older one that has maps preloaded and this one is a lot better and more accurate on locations.No regrets.
1,NO CD & CODE IN BOX,I purchased this as a gift and was very surprised that it did not come with a cd or code. The cd was no big problem as I downloaded TOM TOM Home online but I needed it because it also has the code to activate the maps. Now I am having to pay an addition $50 to get the maps. I could have bought a much better GPS for the total price. When I contacted Amazon they said they could only give me a $14 credit. VERY VERY UPSETTING!! I will not be buying from Amazon anymore as other gifts I ordered also came broken.
4,"Servise is good, but the thing has different...","I bought this Tomtom second-hand GPS and it was send to me with a GARMIN car charger. So, it can not be charged in my car, even the index light did not work (it did work once, so I knew that it can not work well)!When I connected with the seller, he let me return the GPS and refunded me.Altogether, it was a little bit unpleasent purchasing because I donot want to waste time on these little things."
2,Poor quality Maps (TomTom One 2nd edition),"I recently bought TomTom One (2nd edition) from Amazon after the price was reduced to $199.99. It was a disappointment. The unit operates OK but the maps and voice commands suck. I live in NYC and drive in NY and NJ. Quite often TomTom One cannot locate house on a street or, even worse, places a destination several miles away from where it should be (in NJ). Given, NJ addresses are nightmare (duplicate streets in different townships) and TomTom is a European company. But I expected more from this device."
3,Just OK,"Good qualities:* Touch screen is intuitive* 3D and 2D views* Clear directions instructions* Compass (extrapolated from direction of drive)Bad qualities:* Effective map size is small: In 2D view it's hard to read street names* Annoying bugs: ""Avoid Highways"" does not work. While giving directions, it would repeatedly say ""Keep left"" where it should say nothing or just ""Don't exit""* Customer service sucks* Map view is too small: to see details you need to zoom in, but then you can't see the big picture. Keep zooming in and out is not practical.* Too many confusing codes, activation codes, product codes not for humans."
4,Great product for great price,"Very bright screen, great sattelite acquisition.Doesn't say street or road names though"
1,TomTom needs to find a new day job,"I hate this unit with a passion and I sell the things. Its cheap, 299.99 at most retail place right now and that's what you are getting. The One died in 24 hours, while plugged in and never turned back on. It also directed us to a road that was headed into the Pacific Ocean, there is no road across in the pacific last time I checked. It acquired Satelites ONCE and then never acquired them again. And good luck talking to customer service, both I talked to didn't speak english...A dreadful unit, maybe TomTom could go work at Walmart"
1,WMB,"It's not a good product, Magellan or Garmin are worlds better. The maps are out of date badly, it is inconvenient to navigate, not at all intuitive, etc. I'm going to give my TomTom One away if anyone will have it."
3,TOMTOM 1 review,"TomTom ONE Portable GPS Vehicle Navigation SystemWorks very well and finds satellites quickly,however suction cup mount not very good comes loose at times needs better mount Mounts on Garmins much better they have lever to compress and set suction cup"
2,I'd keep looking if I were you,I have used a Tomtom One for a couple of years.Estimated times are always much longer than your actual time.Map updating is expensive. Might as well buy a new unit (Garmin) when looking at the cost of map update.Screen brightness is either daytime or a really bright night setting even when set to minimum.Computer interface is pretty much useless except for being sold more software.
4,My Tom Tom,"Not Sue Sue, Tom Tom! I purchased my Tom Tom One three years ago and I am very satisfied with the results. It is accurate and clear with the verbal direction cues. I am also happy with the way the system will auto adjust if I miss a turn or an exit. I have let friends and relatives borrow the system as well, and they have loved it! The only issue I have with it, is that I can't figure out how to leave it on when I don't have a necessary destination. I have seen other Tom Tom's that have a ""No Destination"" or roaming type mode, but mine does not seem to have it. Other then that, I am very happy with my Tom Tom!"
2,"Good navigation, horrible suction mount","Most reviews and product descriptions of portable navigation devices seem to center around the navigation features, the ease of use, the clarity of the display, or the accuracy of the directions. I've found all this to be quite OK on the TomTom One. After having used myTomTom One for over 3 years, the one thing that has bothered me most is the suction mount. It keeps falling off the windshield. Other navigators that I've seen, including other TomToms and Garmins have better designed suction cup designs with a little clip of wheel that pulls the center of the cup away from the windshield creating a stronger attachment. The one that comes with this TomTome One is flat and just doesn't perform its most basic function very well."
2,Guided me nowhere more than once,I dont know how other products stack up but ive found this one to want to drive off to no where too many times...Just wrong.
3,"Map updates expensive, no traffic via iPhone","TomTom provides great usability, but my experience is that the maps are highly inaccurate. Unfortunately, purchasing updated maps is almost as expensive as buying a new unit!The traffic updates require a bluetooth data connection and will not work with the iPhone (AT&T; and Apple prevent using the iPhone as a bluetooth modem). With an older phone, such as a Motorola RAZR, you can receive data updates. But beware that you will be charged for data access from your wireless carrier.Based on my experience with the TomTom map quality, I will be replacing this unit with a Garmin next time."
3,"Map updates are expensive, and the PoI feature too.",Most of the times it works fine. On few roads it goofs up with the house numbers here in Phoenix area. So we always enter nearest cross-section instead of with the exact house number and street.Many times we have ended up way out of the city almost in a jungle.The maps should be free for updates. 99$ is way too much!!The Point-of-Interest feature is very poor. Can't find names of many popular chain stores. I've seen that working much better in Garmins.My next purchase won't be TomTom for sure.
4,nice entry level GPS,Actually very happy with this purchase. This system is very small and portable and works perfectly fine. I am not even sure if I will be looking for more advanced systems any time soon.
1,I Tried Hard to Like It,"I was excited to get the TomTom One and at first, it seemed great. But then after using it a few more times, I realized to my horror that this device was absolutely useless. It couldn't give me correct directions, telling me to go straight into a one way street. It doesn't have enough POI and could not even locate a major highway. Basically, Google Maps is all you really need, but the problem is getting an internet connection and device wherever you are, which is why I got the TomTom One. But maybe the iPhone is worth it afterall..."
4,Good But Falls a Bit Short,"I used a Garmin Nuvi 350 at another job and it was great for one simple reason; it called out the street name I'm suppose to turn onto. The TomTom only tells you to turn in feet or miles.It takes getting used to and it does work, but using the Garmin before this product ruined my impression of this TomTom. For a few dollars more I prefer the Garmin.I will pawn it off on someone else and buy the Garmin."
3,Missing a lot,"Interface issues aside (and there are many), the main problem with the device is the utter lack of useful Points of Interest. There are plenty of gas stations, restaurants, museums and schools; but if you're looking for any major chain store (Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy, Staples), grocery store, convenience store, basically anywhere you'd want to go every day, you're out of luck. You have to know the exact address of the place you need to go, which usually requires a quick internet search. Not very handy on the go. After recently seeing the built-in navigation system in my friend's car (which was several years old and had extensive listings for all the categories mentioned above), the inadequacy of my brand-new Tomtom was almost too much to bear, and I had to write this review. There are better systems out there."
1,Lousy Customer Service,"Can't say how good a GPS this is. After I plugged it in to be updated, I get a message No Maps Found. TomTom customer service is absoutely lousy. I've been able to learn to where and how to return this defective TomTom One. The company is not standing behind it's product, and neither is Amazon."
2,Not off to a good start,"Got mine this week and setup was easy. Messed around with it on my normal route to get the morning paper. Now for the big test, using it for an actual destination that required the marvel of modern technology. Well, maybe Edison NJ isn't mapped on Satellite yet but the unit hangs up and reboots for all points in Edison NJ. I tried the points of interest (Menlo Park Mall where I wanted go) as well as random addresses in Edison. Reboots every time! Other addresses in NJ work. So, I recommend you buy this as long as you don't need directions to the city of Edison NJ. I sent an email to TomTom so lets see what the remedy is. There is no pone support but I won't go there. Perhaps a topic for another rant.)"
2,TomTom One,"I am a little disappointed in this product. Does a fair job but sometimes the maps aren't complete. Also the last trip I went on, I put in an address and it said I was at my distination when I was still 3 blocks away. The model I got is the New Edition, but the web site for support doesn't even list this one.???"
5,Tom Tom One GPS Navigator,"Excellent value. I am very happy to have found such a great deal. I have been looking to purchase for some time but thought the price too steep, until I found it at Amazon. Getting the second mounting device was also a great idea. Just have to move the GPS to an already set up holder in the second vehicle. Thank you Amazon"
1,Seems I live in limbo...,"I purchased the Tom Tom One at the end of July 2007. I since found whole sections of highway missing, in one instance 20-30 miles showing open fields. This highway was completed in 2004-2005. Consequently the GPS will not route the shortest or fastest route. I contacted customer service and found that they will not support updates or map share on my map version, (v6.65) which is the most current version until edition 3 is released. (v6.75) It is very frustrating because I know that if I found this many missing roads in my small travels the total missing roads must be vast over the entire country. I am going to attempt to return it but I think I am past that point. The bottom line is Tom Tom does not support map updates on my v6.65 unit. They claim that they will support map share on the v6.75 units. All of us with the v6.65 units even though they are a new purchase are just out of luck."
4,TomTom ONE Portable GPS Vehicle Navigation System,"Overall it's a WONDERFUL device and now I don't get lost! Some features that need to added would be nice:1) include a 'ping' just before the correct left/right turn needs to be taken (similar to other GPS units). I sometimes miss a turn because I'm unsure which turn to make correctly.2) there was one instance when it could not find a street in San Jose, CA at all, even after several tries to enter the address."
5,Wonderful Unit,"We had been holding back on GPS but just rec'd a consumer magazine that rated the Tom Tom One a best buy at $300. Later that day I saw a Staples ad with a $199 price - on my way out the door to pick one up I figured I'd ping Amazon if only to read the reviews. There it was, $199 with free shipping and no sales tax - a no brainer.Like the unit and agree that screen size is perfect. I have already found shortcuts on routes I frequently drive that I didn't know existed."
3,Please fix the software,"Please, please fix the PC interface software! Very difficult to use on the PC. Why isn't ""SET A DESTINATION"" a most obvious box to click on? In fact, it's not there at all. That's why you buy this in the 1st place, to SET A DESTINATION and get there. Of course BUYING FROM THE STORE is quite obvious. I'd love to re-design the user interface completely....it's frustrating. The device does work well, but that PC interface is a horror."
2,Where am I?,"I bought this on hearty recommendations, but I'm lost. It lead me to a gas station that doesn't exist (I ran out of gas thanks to this unit) and suggests left hand turns off of divided highways. It usually suggests routes that work out, but how can I trust something that has betrayed me before? I don't know what else to say except that if I could return it, I would. This is my first gps, so unreliability may just be the thorn on the rose for all of them, or not."
2,DISAPPOINTED,After my buddy drove by with his new Garmin streetpilot i5 I knew I just had to have a GPS too. So after reading all the reviews and pros opinions in my price range I choose the Tomtom one. After only 5 day of use this unit located my home on a differnt street. Miss my mother's home by a half mile. Located my daugther's house two streets east of where she lives. It has only been right on about 40 percent of the time. It is very easy to use but what good is that if it doesn't take to the location you want to go. Can I trust this unit in a city that is new to me to get me to the right location? I did check with Tomtom and I do have the newest map. By the way the Garmin my buddy has located my home at the proper location.
3,TomTom needs help,"Pretty good basic product. But when I tried to get another free voice that I had a promotion code for, it had expired. Not sure why. Also, sometimes streets that have been around for 6+ years do not show up. Very frustrating. Acurate 75% of the time."
2,Frustration plus,"OK...I'm not a novice in dealing with computer hardware; I work for Intel. This bit of technology has been nothing but a frustration since I received it for my birthday. I wanted to download a 'custom voice', and found that I could ONLY do that for a US (American). After 2 months, finally figured out how to do that.Presently, I'm trying to figure out how to gather traffic data from TomTom. But when I try to link that info, I see traffic info outside the US only. Wha? Tried to call Customer Support - wrong business hours. I have to call them from work? What kind of CS is that!?I would recommend anything BUT TomTom..."
4,Christmas Present,"This is a gift for my college-age son, who travels quite a bit between home & school. It's still in the package - and won't be opened until 12/25/07. It looks pretty cool, tho!"
2,Insane Packaging What Gives?,I haven't even booted my TT One yet because I am still recovering from the ordeal of opening the plastic bubble package. The heavy duty plastic bubble required metal cutters and large scissors (while praying that the TomTom did not go flying). This insane packaging might help impulse sales in a retail store but is infuriating and is a lawsuit waiting to happen. Did I say that it is infuriating?
3,Reliable but with a caveat,"I purchased this unit for my daughter and a Garmin Nuvi 350 for myself. The Tom Tom does not speak the name of the street, just says 'turn right in 200 feet' while the Garmin speaks the name of the street. If the name of the street is important to you, either purchase the higher priced TomTom or the Garmin. If just being told to turn is acceptable to you, this unit will work well for you."
3,It works!!!,"I originally ordered this for my wife for her birthday and it got lost in the mail.Amazon of course replaced it immediatly i got it but it did not have an sd card that holds the maps so it would not work.I went back and forth with tom tom trying to get one they said it was amazons fault so i just broke down and bought a 1 gb card for 10 bucks.It was not amazons fault thatTomTom was being stupidAnyways The unit tself is small,portable and can even be used walking or biking.The only problem i have had is the fact that the directions will take you thru residential streets if its the fastest and in some cases down dark dirt roads in the middle of the night.My wife is pretty scared the first time she encountered this issueThe device only see the quickest way it does not know if its a dark country road or a neighborhood with 50 stop signs and speed bumps.I really wish they would route you thru major roads but it only sees the fstest or shortest route depending on the settings"
3,average,"This unit does a descent job of getting to where you want to go. Some things I don't like...1. Sometimes streets with a ""W.,E.,N.,or S."" before the name of the street can only be found by typing the name of the street -- which is not intuitive to me. Other times you need to type in the 'W,E,N, or S' first. 2. Sometimes it shows ""1st"" street as ""First"" and others it shows as ""1st"" -- once again, not consistent. 3. If an address doesn't exist, the device shouldn't show it. 4. It doesn't usually take the you quickest way -- instead it always directs you to the major interstates and highways, even if there is a quicker and shorter path using secondary roads. 5. It doesn't show private drives or roads. 6. It doesn't show or tell you what direction you are going (ie north).For the price, it is a descent value. I wish they would have gotten all of the bugs out of it by now."
5,"Robust, Easy to Use, Simple GPS Device","I used this device for a couple of months before it's battery started acting wierd and I had to return it. I am looking for a new one with some additional features; but if you are a first time GPS user or are not very technology savvy, then this device is the one to go for.Very easy to use, simple user experience, manageable, light, and clear directions. I did not have any problem at all with this device. It is very proactive and tells you about the next action (turn, bear left/right, take an exit) much before it is due and hence gives you enough time to understand and plan.The screens are very intuitive and it is very easy to plan a trip, find nearby locations or spots.Overall, an excellent buy and value for money!"
3,I'm confused as to liking it or not.,"I like the way it looks, sounds, and all the options, but I HATE the fact that if you tell it to take you to an address and you after telling it that change your mind, it doesn't have a cancel button. If you go to a different address that you don't need the GPS cause you know how to get there, it keeps trying to take you to the one you changed your mind about. I looked everywhere to find a cancel button, and it does not have one. Also hate that www.tomtom.com does not work. Try going there and good luck."
3,Unit is just okay,"TomTom One is an okay product. I have found serveral POI incorrect/missing. I would not give it wonderful reviews, as others have done. The customer service at TomTom is definitely lacking and in my opinion misleading. I would purchase a Garmin if I had it to do over."
4,TomTom One review,"Purchased for a two week vacation to travel down the east coast from NH to VA and back home. Got us everywhere successfully even right down to actual street addresses in inner city Baltimre and Washington, DC. A more detailed user manual would have made learning how to usethe unit easier although we did learn through trial and error. We were very glad to have TomTom on board with us in unfamiliir territory."
4,Good value GPS,"Excellent GPS. However, I have found that the quickest route which seems to be the default is not, often choosing roads that result in a much longer trip. If you can get it to choose the shortest route then it does give very good directions. Menu selections sometimes difficult to select."
1,Poor Maps,"I originally ordered a TomTom One over the Garmin Nuvi 350 because it was cheaper, but that was a mistake. It gave me awful directions, and the maps were out of date. One road where I live is about 5 years old, and the TomTom did not have it. Also, the directions were so poor that I would have preferred printing directions from Yahoo instead of using this device.I ended up returning the TomTom and getting the Garmin Nuvi 350, and I am much happier. The Garmin has the road that the TomTom was missing, and the directions are much better.Garmin, most other GPS devices, and web sites like Yahoo all use Navteq maps. These are considered the best. The TomTom uses TeleAtlas, which aren't as good in North America.The Garmin was definitely worth the extra money."
2,Too buggy,"I recently used my new Tomtom on a trip from Northern California to Southern California and then to Las Vegas and on to the Grand Canyon. I have found the unit too buggy in terms of routing. From what I have read on the Internet, this unit uses Tele-Atlas, the data base from a Dutch firm and most of the competitors, including Yahoo and Google use the Navteq data base, a U.S. based firm and generally get much better results. Tomtom had me going in one direction and making a U-turn on the freeway for some unknown reason. I'm going to sell this unit and buy a Garmin Nuvi 350. It's too bad as I like the styling and feel of the Tomtom...too bad the navigating is not up to par."
2,"Incredibly stupid UI, maps not detailed enough.","The unit looks and feels nice and modern, but the user interface is just not good enough. In the main navigation screen, it is not possible to scroll the map. You need to struggle through several screens to be able to do that. More importantly, while main roads are of course there, many smaller unpaved and even paved roads are missing. Taking into consideration that the older and cheaper Mio C310x shows even hiking trails, this is a major flaw. One more disadvantage is that even at the highest magnification, single houses are not shown, just outlines of streets. Again, the cheaper Mio C310x shows single houses making navigation easier. Overall, a nicely looking unit, but just not good enough. My unit was defective, but I would have returned it anyways."
4,TomTomm review,I gave this tomtom to my husband and he is having so much fun with it. There are a few things we still need to figure out but we are happy with it. It's a good beginners GPS.
4,It's alright,The product is really great for the handheld. But to start off is not that easy. But I hope that it will help us on the trip.
4,Great For the price,guess...it's great for the price.....picks up sat pretty fast and is pretty accurate...does occassionally takes some wacky routes but it totally a treat to have when i am working
4,Good but ....,I bought the TomTom One and returned it because the Garmin Nuvi 360 gives me the name of the street I am turning into. This is a big plus. I don't have to take my eyes off the road to confirm that I am turning into the correct street. Last week my co-worker and I decided to do a test. We picked a destination and found both the TomTom and Garmin took us essentially to the same destination when we entered an address. We had to take a trip to a hardware store. I picked Shopping and then House and Garden. The Garmin showed me Lowes is 2.1 miles and Home Depot is 2.3 miles away. The TomTom didn't show the stores. I think Garmin has a more up to date map.
1,before you buy...,"Parents: love your children for who they are. They are already perfect. Your children love you unconditionally; so show them the same love. There is nothing you need to change, and there is nothing you can prevent. There is only the love and support of family. This book has no place in a family."
1,please recycle this book as toilet paper,if i could give this worthless garbage no stars i would but it is nto an option so i will specify that the star is for the good trees that were used to make the paper.THIS BOOK IS NOT A GUIDE BUT AN INCITEMENT TO CHILD ABUSE
1,Never have I read a bigger crock in my life....,"This book is utter nonsense. Clearly, this book was not written by a psych major and those of us that are can't help but stand with our jaws gaping. This book occurred as a result of ignoring the ""thou shalt not bear false witness"" command. As a requirement to rate the book, I HAD to offer one star when really no stars is called for."
1,Guide to loose your mind,"There is no way to prevent your kid from becoming a homosexual. This book will not prevent your kid from being a homosexual. This book will make your kids a lot more distant and depressed. They are born this way, the best thing to do is support them, they are your children. This book was made with ignorance.Want to be a good parent, watch Prayer's for Bobby. Imagine you are in his parent's shoes."
1,Learn to accept your child for who he or she is.,"If you're thinking about buying this book, you'd be better off seeing a therapist to discuss problems with your controlling personality. Still feel compelled to control or change your child's sexuality?If you SUSPECT your child is gay, he or she probably is. Your best bet for their (and your) future happiness is to learn more about your child, get involved in his or her life and his interests, and stop being judgmental about who he or she chooses to be in a relationship with. If you are more interested in forcing your child to behave or dress the way you prefer, you probably won't be seeing much of them after they leave home."
1,Disappointed. Expected much more...,"I'm a psychologist, and I began to read this book because I was interested in how the author would disclaim the scientific data that shows that, very likely, homosexuality has a genetic influence (as shows, for example, the eye-blink experiment). However, I was severely disappointed when I realised the authors' arguments were weak, inconsistent and loose. There was no real rebuke to the scientific studies, just some comments on what 'seemed' flaws in the methods. No proof whatsoever. I realise that to many people (not medical doctors or psychologists), the arguments the author presents may actually seem intelligent and sightful, but to be honest, they are really weak and flawed. I was actually kind of angry at the end of the book: does the author think we people are dumb and we'll buy anything? Apparently. I honestly don't recommend it."
1,quackery disguised as science,pseudoscience...today's version of snake oil...buy this book if you like going through the hassle of returning items.a compilation of blatant author bias and cherry picked statistics and case studies to support the thesis. i've read freshman composition papers that were better thought out and supported.and the funny thing is... i'm not even gay. i just thought it would be an interesting read.
1,HORRIFYING,"If I could rate this lower than one star, I would. It is stunning that the authors apparently offer this seriously - and even more amazing that anyone would take it seriously."
1,Disappointing,"I am not going to say that I am outraged that this book is clearly anti-gay. It is understandable and okay that different people see things differently, but a very large question remains: why do you want to prevent homosexuality? I see the ""absent-father"" issue plays a large ENVIRONMENTAL ROLE in affecting future prospects, however, that issue lies under a larger issue: poor parenting. This book really should be titled: ""To a Parent Who Does Not Quite Understand."" It should really help those parents who neglect their children. Also, as long as one is not being harmed, any sexuality is a personal choice (yes, it often is a CHOICE, but it appears that it may also have a genetic COMPONENT) and is none of said one's concern. Shame."
1,Bigotry,"This book is based on, simply put, false understandings of sexuality and a misguided attempt to change certain inevitable qualities of peoples' identities (their sexual orientation). Not helpful for parents or anyone really."
1,Bigoted,"Why would you even want this? Are you from the middle ages? Are you a member of the Westborough Baptist Church? Are you a hick?If your answer to any of these is no, then what the hell?! I really hope that people aren't so stupid that they actually believe that there's something in this.Thing is, the people who would buy this are clueless so they would believe it."
5,Don't believe it,Don't believe the pro-gay blather that says that people dealing with homosexuality cannot be treated and experience healing in their life. Nicolosi is right on with his studies and his work. This book is a must-read for all those working in marriage and family life.
2,As a physician reading this,"As a physician reading this book, one of the striking things about it is the lack of knowledge, or possibly purposeful misleading, in Dr. Nicolosi's arguments. I read this book with a rather open mind in trying to write on the subject of alternative therapies, and was very disappointed. Dr. Nicolosi has either a completely clouded world view... that discounts science, or deliberately misleads the uneducated reader into denying current accepted thought and practice in medicine and psychiatry (not to mention science). While I would grant that he seems to have some well meaning intentions (in his world view), I would argue that his method would probably do more harm than good, as the success rate (which I do not believe is ever quoted in the book) of his therapy is undoubtedly low, and he offers no acceptance model if ""therapeutic failure"" results. ..."
1,Psychologically Harmful,"I find this type of hateful discrimination sold as ""self-help"" very hurtful to people that truly need someone to care. Thanks Amazon for allowing filth to proliferate in the name of free-speech. You're better off choosing a book likeComing Out of Shame : Transforming Gay and Lesbian Lives."
1,Because I can't award zero stars...,"This book is a joke, and anyone believing for one iota of a second that homosexuality can be ""prevented"" is fooling themselves. Here's a shred of useful advice for you:Love your kids regardless of their sexuality; they will thank you for it. Do not ask or demand them to change something that comes naturally to them. Homosexuality is not a trend people! It is inherent, whether you would like to believe that or not.As a straight woman interested in Queer Theory (and someone who has a number of gay friends/colleagues), I looked at this book mostly for the sake of curiosity. As I suspected, it tries (and fails) to pass itself off as ""scientific BS"" (as one reviewer put it).If you are a parent worried about your son or daughter's sexuality, and it scares you that they don't fit into the confines of heteronormative society, educate YOURSELF. It is easy to fear what you do not understand. Talk to your kids, don't look for answers in garbage books like this one."
