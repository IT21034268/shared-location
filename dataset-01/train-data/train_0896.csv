4,History of the Gothic,"This book is an excellent read for anyone with an interest in the history or scholarship the Gothic or ""horrible"" literature in general. Its focus on the shift in English society to a more luxury and consumer-driven economy, during the time when supernatural literature developed as a genre, becomes a little dense at times, if that isn't one's area of particular interest. However, it is full of insight into the reading public that made the field of supernatural fiction what it remains today, and why people found it (and by extension, still find it) so entertaining to be shocked and frightened by unreal events."
5,A must read.,"This is an amazing book for anyone that is suffering from a terminal disease, works in nursing (hem/onc, PC), or a practitioner (NP/PA/MD) that wants to understand their terminal patients and how to approach them and treat them. A must read."
5,"A ""must-read"" book for the student of Strauss and Nietzsche","Lampert's book is a much-needed corrective to the prevailing view of Strauss's relationship to Nietzsche. As in his other books, Lampert focuses on a narrow selection of source material--in this case, Strauss's 16-page essay on Beyond Good and Evil--so the result is kind to the lay reader as well as deep for the scholar. Using Straussian exegesis on the master himself, Lampert brings to light the formative influence of Nietzsche on Strauss's political thought, an influence that Strauss acknowledged but veiled in esoteric speech. Lampert's book is a philosophical detective story, told with style and authority."
4,Bolero heavy album,"This album features the great and highly underrated Sammy ""el Rolo"" Gonzalez and Paquito Guzman. Although the album features good songs like ""Debate"" and the classic Tito Puente's ""Cuero Na'ma"", it is focused much more on Paquito Guzman and his boleros. Don't get me wrong, Paquito has one off the most beautiful voices you'll ever hear, but if you're looking for salsa, this might not the most appropriate album. I have to admit that Paquito's rendition of ""Alma con Alma"" was absolutely amazing."
1,Instant view has the wrong movie!,"I have no idea what this is. It is NOT the 1991 film with Tony Curtis, Isaac Hayes, and Jenilee Harrison.Whatever they are showing was made in 1990, and doesn't show up in IMDB as a movie, or as a listing on the entries of any of the actors. Thinking this might have been renamed, I spot checked the actor IMDB listings, and they seem to have none in common. The movie credits do not list a Director or Producer in either the opening or closing credits. That's weird. Guess this wasn't a union production, huh? Whatever this is, it seems to be made way, way off the record. It also blows.Save your three bucks. If you want to see the film, gonna have to pop for a used DVD."
5,spend my whole life with you,"i have been looking for zappIII for a couple of years now. particularly for this one song, i love it. i wanted it as my wedding song where can i find it? please bring it back."
5,spend my whole life,spend my whole life is one the greatet love songs ever.bringing it back would be a tribute to Roger and his brother. since they are no longer here.BRING IT BACK.
4,Useful textbook,"The material is presented in a very easy to understand manner. Example Matlab, C++, and Fortran codes are included for many topics."
3,Not too happy with it,"I used this book for a Graduate level course and I bought it because it was the recommended text. I didn't like it, though, too big for its content. I am sure there should be better texts on the subject."
4,Good daypack for running around town,"The Kelty Basalt was a good daypack for an overnight trip or for running around town. A little on the smaller side, but the space was certainly adequate (albeit a bit tight) for an overnight trip."
2,Something's Missing !,The original BBC performance was a masterpiece ... very clever and the original 30's music nicely balanced a rather dreary but effective screenplay. Hollywood produced a 90 minute substitute (in name only.) Don't buy it ... but grab the original Bob Hoskins BBC original if it ever lands on our shores!
3,A noble failure...,"It was a mistake to think that you could take a 8 1/2 hour miniseries and make an hour and 48 minute film version of it successfully. The film feels like a trailer, when the scenes just seemed all slapped together. They go by too quickly, and the film's pacing suffers as a result. It's like when a massive novel is simplified for a film. Martin and Peters do their best (though they're not as good as Hoskins and Campbell in the original), the film is well shot, and, overall, it's watchable. The filmmakers do manage to capture the tone of the miniseries here, with its sometimes jarring juxaposition between reality of the depression and the songs of the depression (which were ridiculously cheery). This was just a bad idea to do this film, and honestly, there really was no way to do it well, especially in such a short running time. But they get a few points for trying. Watch the original, which is a masterpiece...."
2,Potter's Vision Clouded By Hollywood,"What made the BBC series ""Pennies From Heaven"" so great was the time it allowed the story to unfold. Simply put, there is no way this effect can be realized in a 90 minute Hollywood production. Regardless of Steve Martin's wonderful dancing and the always brilliant Ms. Peters, this telling of the story falls flat for those of us who were first introduced to this dark but oddly happy tale in its original form with Bob Hoskins as the hapless sheet-music salesman. If only it were as simple to purchase the BBC video instead of this weak Hollywood production."
2,A Pale Imatation of the Original,"Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters work mightily in this VERY abbreviated version of the original Pennies, but the result is a very small ""mouse.""The producers use SOME of the original music, but apparently trying to appeal to a U.S. audience also inserted some American popular music, to the detriment of the movie.I consider this one of Steve's genuine ""turkeys!"" And I believe I read that he agreed with that evaluation.Amazon is asking a fortune for this 108 minute pale version of a wonderful NINE hour television play written by Dennis Potter. Skip it and go straight to the ORIGINAL, if it is not too pricey for you.A genuine television work of art -- and TV has seldom produced any art at all."
3,What an odd movie,"Musical numbers are fabulous - love the choreography and costuming. I like the idea of the dark plot interwoven with the full blown musical moments. But the characters feel soul-less, especially the women (Bernadette Peters and Jessica Harper). Had the director encouraged them to connect emotionally with the audience, it would have been a much more likeable movie."
2,They can't be serious- can they?,"Everyone in this misguided extravaganza tries hard -- maybe too hard -- to make something meaningful and entertaining of what amounts to expensive bloat. But for many viewers, it just doesn't work. For those who've seen the 1936 Depression-era original of the same title, the oldie has less but offers more, even if what it offers is sentimental Hollywood mush. Ah, but listen, isn't that what the lyrics of the title song are all about, how to make more from less? The original likely isn't the greatest film classic of all time, but it's a hopeful little bit of fluff with excellent performances and some of Crosby's nicest tunes. I was given the Steve Martin DVD of this title by a close relative (gift wrapped by Amazon, of course), so I suppose I'm obliged to keep it. But watching Martin's work simply made me more desirous of sitting back with a copy of the 1936 original, which I finally bought from Amazon and which I and everyone who watched it enjoyed much more."
5,"Great Movie, Mediocre Transfer","My five star rating is for the movie (which is quite wonderful, despite some of the clueless reviews below -- folks, it's supposed to be artificial and emotionally detatched, that's the point!) and not for the DVD quality, which is disappointing. The movie begged for a top-notch DVD production, but Warner's dropped the ball on this one. The transfer is fair at best -- a shame for one of the most beautifully shot movies of the past thirty years. This is the kind of movie that DVD's were made for, and yet Warner's didn't bother to take advantage of the medium. We learn in the reunion interviews (the disc's only extra), for example, that there were a couple of musical numbers which were deleted from the final version to keep the running time down -- at least one of which, by everyone's account, was amazing. Why are these not on the DVD?"
2,"OK, but suffers in comparison to the original","I'm surprised by the range and vehemence of reactions to this movie -- who thought that many people had even seen it? Here's my two pennies: Bernadette Peters and Christopher Walken are great; Steve Martin obviously worked hard to learn his dance steps, but you can see the sweat and that means he ain't no Astaire or Kelly. I don't think we need to burn all copies of this video, but anyone who has seen the original TV production will be disappointed by this movie version. And if you think about it, what was the point of this movie? To remake a diminished version of something great? To give us something easier to swallow than a 6-hr show with English accents? Another insult to Americans (who probably deserve it). Hey, I'm starting to see how people can get so worked up over this movie...."
1,Crude and vulgar.,"This movie sickened me. The music was great, but the way it was used in the movie didn't do it justice. To be frank- I hated this movie and couldn't find anything to like about it. Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters were as wonderful as they always are, but I really hate to see talent wasted. I really can't understand what kind of a sick and twisted mind would write a screenplay like that. I was completely disgusted with the utter lack of any kind of loyalty and honest, decent charity for mankind. It was very unrealistic and I found it not amusing at all. If it was supposed to be, it was only feeding the perverse minds of people who enjoy that."
4,Good Steve Martin Movie,"I really enjoyed Steve Martin's ""Pennies From Heaven"". It is a sad story line. But the songs and dance numbers keep the film moving. Steve Martin is great as the traveling salesman who is having a hard time getting his life together.Bernadette Peters is fantastic as a women he meets and seduces. It was interesting seeing the choices her character makes. And I think Bernadette Peters did a good job here as an actress.Also, outstanding was Christopher Walken's performance. Its amazing watching him dance.The film is very interesting. And it is interesting watching Steven Martin perform in this dramatic role."
4,New French Country,"This book is written for people who are building, remodeling, and/or decorating a home in the French/European country style. It is a sophisticated study, with many beautiful photos and text. Sources are included in part. The book also shows exteriors, landscaping, gardens, and terraces that are exceptional."
2,Enough Pictures Already!!,"I received this ""picture book"" for Christmas and was really curious as to what I could gain. I am a new homeowner and was really stuck on how to model my new kitchen. After finishing Linda's book I must say I was very disappointed. I want ideas not pictures. I understand that a picture speaks a thousand words, but I would like some actual words to go with it. A kitchen is one of the most important aspects of a home, and one should express their knowledge of how to go about making a kitchen by telling... not just showing. And honestly, what is with the random pictures of fruit?... seem like fillers to me. Thanks but No Thanks!"
2,"Not as ""Life-Changing"" as I thought","The ""book"" itself is actually a 3""x4"" pamphlet and probably not worth the expense. It's so short that the full version is online for free somewhere. Really doesn't read well as it is a transcript of an address given to a crowd in Pennsylvania. Alright content, but not what I expected."
4,Quantum Leap Forward,"The last Busdriver I've heard was ""Temporary Forever"", which, while impressive, kind of was less than spectacular DJ work, and sounded somewhat like an updated Fuschnickens album. This latest release caught me by surprise...it's (thankfully) far from being catchy, but is dense, funky and uncompromising, and is sure to stand up to many repeat listenings. Simply, he is in his own world now. His lyrics are dopier-than-thou, with that fast delivery he's seemed to have cribbed from the above Fu. He's much better than that group, however, as the DJ work on this album is far more sophisticated than on his previous above-mentioned album. Stellar work - he's really more impressive than Outkast is right now, and the torch of hip-hop is born forward, despite all odds."
4,Leaves you wanting more,"This album left me wanting more, and not in a good way. First, I know there is a long tradition of recycling tunes, words, and even titles in country music. But I think the traditional Durham's Reel (also known as Durham's Bull) is more interesting. His biggest barn burners seem to be Cackling Hen and Lee Highway Blues, which are almost the same tune. How about a tune with more than two parts? I don't suppose we need another Orange Blossom Special, but how about Beaumont Rag? Or Grey Eagle? Or Ace of Spades? With all due respect to Michael's blinding speed and facility, he does start to sound the same after a while."
4,Great scent.,This is the ORIGINAL Ocean Dream and it is a wonderful perfume. I love this scent and will buy this again.
4,Its good,I think this is a very good book which includs no violence or any other things like that. This is a collection which every family should have and enjoy it 2gether.
5,"These sound great, just great.","Originally I started using in-ear earphones at work to isolate me from the office noise. I started with the Shure E2c and liked them pretty well.My ears are not built for the normal earbud; I need something that would stay in my ear. Later, in a moment of weakness I decided to upgrade to the E3c and I have no regrets. While I know there are better earphones out there, I think that for the price these are great. They make a big improvement while watching movies on an airplane. They are well balanced acoustically with good base and good highs with a nice midrange in between. They also are not victim to noise when the wires move around.The come in a great little case that makes them convenient for travel.I've had these for a few years now and am very happy with them. By the way, I would give the E2c's 5 stars as well. They don't sound quite as good, but they are almost half the price."
2,"Sounds great, but broke after less than a year","These are easily the best sounding ear buds I've owned, however, both buds have broken at different times requiring me to crazy-glue them back together. For this price, I'd expect Shure to use a better grade of plastic or metal. Now the sound in the right earpiece no longer works at all. I've owned these less than a year. I'll be buying a different brand in the future."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I found the sound with these to be good under ideal cirumstances, with an excellent seal. Without a tight seal within the ear canal, they are not great, as is true for all in ear phones. It was difficult for me to get and maintain this tight seal, and I tried all the different earpieces. I also found them uncomfortable for any length of time. I finally gave up and got over the ear phones and they sound amazing for half the price."
2,Very poor low frequency range,"I was stunned at the poor bass quality of the E3Cs. I consider myself a ""golden ear"" and have an array of high-end equipment. Like others have said, range is poor for these earphones. Music sounds tinny. Everything sounds bad. Don't get these phones."
1,shure earphone - leave much to hope,"I bought these E3c's hoping it would be an upgrade from the much cheaper ones that came with the IPOD. BIG MISTAKE! I have great audio equipment and care a lot about a good sound. These earphones are not worth more than 30-40 dollars.These not only have a much worse sound. They are impossible to keep in the ear, no matter which of the buttons you try. I found out later 2 of my friends had the same problem."
1,worthless,These sound awful. I'm embarrassed to admit I spent 140.00 on these. The earphones from my 1989 sony walkman are far superior. If you like your music to sound as if it came from the bottom of a well then these are for you.
2,"Amazing sound, but they won't stay in my ears!","I am very disappointed in these. They sound fantastic and look cool, but no matter what I do they fall out of my ears. I bought different sized foam pieces to see if I could find a size that would fit me better, but nothing seems to work. The original I-pod earbuds don't sound as good as these, but at least they stay in my ears. Maybe I have abnormal ear canals or something, but unfortunately these E3's were a waste of money for me."
3,Not satisfied,"I'd read a lot of reviews on these and expected more. The bass response, as you might expect for such small things, is not good enough, for me at least. Regardless of what all the ""audiophiles"" out there say. And I've closely read and followed what they say about having to position them just right in your ears etc. Maybe I'm spoiled by my Bose headphones. I am going to try and sell my set now. Too bad, because they are better at noise elimination as they seal the ear canal and the Bose does not filter all frequencies on purpose."
3,"Amazing headphones, but...............","When reading this comment from the AMAZON review - ""Rest easy in the knowledge that the E3c's deliver clear, crisp highs and rich, thundering lows."", I was very eager to pick myself up a pair of these beauties. Upon arrival I threw them in my iPod and threw on one of my fav jazz tracks, it was amazing as expected, but to my dismay my electronica tracks completely stink. The thundering lows are nearly non-existant, its very tough to get into a beat when it sounds like its being produced by a speaker from a Gameboy. So in that I am disappointed. Again, I still love these headphones am would recommend them to most of my friends but the Amazon review threw me for a loop with that comment."
2,Ok but I agree to much for what you get,I was expecting sound nirvana as I am a musician and am familar with the Shure brand. I tried every size ear peice and none realy fit. To get a full range sound I had to press them in my ear. If I moved around at all they alwasy came out. Way to much effort. Not worth (...)
1,Wow....either I got a bad set or My ears are going bad!,"I bought a set of these from the APPLE store. The sounded worse than the stock earbuds I got with my iPod. No bass...tiney (sp?) at best. I used them for about 5 minutes and walked back to the store. The rubber ""orbs"" that go in your ear also make for a ""swish"" sound when you walk making them virtually impossible to exercise in, to the point of being so distracting if they sounded great I probably would have taken them back (I rarely return anything!). It sounded like you were walking with an Ultrasound machine attached to your head....wooosh woosh....woosh! Not impressed at all!I wonder if I just got a bad set of buds...but for $179 (at the store) you'd figure they'd be bullet proof! I kept my ""stockers"" and just will have to get used to the pain they cause in my ears. My Humble Opinion.....try before you buy!!!Dundertaker"
2,Total lack of bass,"The sound is great in general, but the total lack of bass makes them worthless for the price. Even if it were 40$ then i would have given them 4 stars, but at this price, earphones need to be perfect."
4,Hi-Fi plus good enough for use on airplanes.,"When I board an airplane I like to lean back and listen, either to an audio book or to John Adams/Samuel Barber or the equivalent. I'd recently purchased the Sony noise canceling headphone the MDR-NC22 which like the ultra-expensive Bose headphones uses active suppression to cancel out the aircraft's vibration. Could Shure E3c Sound Isolating Earphones do an equally good job for my audio books plus provide the necessary fidelity to reproduce a full orchestra? The answer proved to be yes and yes. The din of the aircraft vanished plus I could make out the individual instruments. An excellent buy and a lot lighter to carry around than the cumbersome Bose.One minor caveat: you may have to fiddle with the earplugs for a moment or two to get the right fit."
2,"These are okay, but the Ety's are MUCH better","I owned these earphones for awhile (with amply time to break them in), and while they are a huge step up from the included iPod earbuds, they are not great.The biggest disappointment is that the fidelity of music is not quite there. They produce good sound, just not great. And earphones that cost more than $100 need to sound better than good.Try the Etymotic Research ER-4P. They produce a significantly better soundstage and incredibly deep and accurate bass. ipodlounge has these as the top rated earphones out there.I listen to all kinds of music. Classical. Jazz. Rap. Rock. Funk. You name it. I listen to it. So having a good set of earphones, especially for airplane rides is important.Do yourself a favor and at least check out the Etymotic's. They are significantly better than anything out there. (The only possible exception would be the E500, which I've tried, and they are indeed great. Only they are also a $550 purchase.)"
1,Great on sound quality short on service life,"Great sounding earphones but for the price Shure should be using better quality plastic wire covering. This is my second pair in 2 years that the plastic wire covering dried out, became brittle and cracked open exposing the wiring inside. I use it in the over ear configuration.They are too expensive to replace every year due to poor component quality choice by Shure."
1,E3C Poor Durability,"My left earphone went dead with very light use and fell just outside the warranty period. For a pair of $200 (MSRP) headphones, these should be longer lived and more durable."
2,Great Sound . Quality Problems,"I would have rated these headphones 5 stars however, I have had to return 2 pairs of them within a year and a half. I am a fairly heavy user of the headphones .. about 3 hours every day on my commute to and from work. Both sets of earphones lasted about 7 months with premium sound. Then I noticed a slight sound problem in the left earphone and the problem quickly got much worse until there was no sound in the left at all.These earphones were properly stored at all times and never abused. I did buy the phones only 3 months after they were introduced to the market so the problems may have been worked out.Shure has honered their warrenty replacing both pairs at no charge. However, I feel that when you pay a premium for a set of earphones like these, the quality should be much better."
5,good earbuds,"I just got these today. I've been using a pair of $10 Koss in-ear buds for over a year. They have foam you squish down, then it expands in your ear. The most unbelievable bass. So for $150 I really expected these to be a lot better. Turns out, the mids and highs are the same, but the Koss has better bass. The Koss buds somehow have the bass almost vibrate your head like you are really sitting at home in front of a subwoofer. I don't know how they did it. But the Koss are very uncomfortable for long periods, to the point you want to rip your ears off. The Shure's feel wonderful, I had them in for 10 hours today and my ears loved it. They sound good, they feel good. I just wish they had the bass of the Koss."
2,Durability definately an issue,"First pair I bought lasted almost 2 years before the right side earphone quit working completely. Shure replaced them under warranty with a refurbished pair. Second pair lasted almost 1 year before the left side earphone quit working completely. Shure replaced them under warranty with a refurbished pair. Third pair lasted approximately 1.5 years before the right side earphone quit working. Shure will not replace the third pair because they only warranty their warranty replacements for 1 year. Overall the sound quality is very good, however if you are active while wearing them don't expect them to last. I expected much more durability from this Shure product considering the price."
3,Sound great....now if I could only get them to stay put.,No doubt about it: These head phones sound great. When properly worn they do cancel out all backround noise but that's the trick isn't it? Wearing them properly. The trick is to select the correct sized earbud. Apparently I have weird ears. They're either too small which means they're constantly falling out or too big which means they hurt when wearing them. I find my self constantly readjusting them for the perfect seal. I'm also not crazy about the vacuum that seems to be created when they are inserted. It creates pressure in my ear canal and gives me a headache. Forget about working out with them unless you want to spend your entire workout reinserting them. Looks like I'm fated to use over the head models.
1,Warning: dont sweat,"Yes, the sound is great, but only if you sit still on a winter day. I am now on my 3rd (and last) pair in a few weeks of these---as soon as you start to sweat, the moisture in your ear enters the earphone and it shuts off. SOME of the sound returns after a day or two, but not all of it The user guide states simply: ""Normal operation often returns after the earphone dries out."" Often? Try never. For $180, these should function for more than a week...."
3,A layman's review,"I have several pairs of headphones: Sennheiser PX-100 (on-ear phones, great value), Sony MDR-V6 (over ear phones, good value). The E3c phones I just got I would say sound good, but not as bright or crisp at the Sennheiser PX-100, which are 1/4 the price. They do block out external noise very well, but you have to get used to them stuck firmly in your ear canals. They are good, accurate sound reproduction, but at $180 are about $90 overpriced in my opinion. Expect adequate, but not great, bass. I think Shure, Inc. is getting greedy.Update 12/7/2006:I like these headphones, but the bass is definitely lacking, even with the ipod's EQ set to Bass Booster. I just picked up a pair of the Sony EX51 earphones for $39.99. The bass is FAR, FAR superior to the Shures. If you're an audiophile you may discern that the Shures are a little more acoustically accurate, but the Sonys sound so much fuller I am sticking with them. For the money it's the Sony, hand's down."
4,Great sounding but the wres a little too stiff,Sound quality wise these headphones are the best I've had but only the foam inserts worked for me which was quite annoying since they are pretty nasty now since I use them at the gym. I believe the foam inserts themselves are relatively expensive to replace. After spending a good deal of money on the headphones I'm hesitent to spend more money (they're about a dollar each.. not a pair). Also the wires are quite stiff and relatively larger than other cheap headphones (like iPods earhpones).
3,"good, but do i know it?",unfortunetly i like a more bass sounding earpiece. this one maybe clear but i needed to tweek the playback to add bass to the sound. i can't seem to get the ear piece to stay in. everyone is going to kill me but the radioshack ones that come with the plastic rollup case sfor about $8 sound better to me. (i know i'm gonna get killed here.) but i guess i don't know better.
2,Not Enough Bang for the Buck,"I used these for about 3 weeks before returning them. If I didn't know how much I spent on them, I would say they are ok. There is something about spending a lot and expecting a lot. Well, find another pair of earphones, these have a decent sound, mid-range bass reflex and get uncomfortable after an hour of use. They are basically ear plugs with a small driver on the outside. If I paid $40 for these, I would keep them. Anything past that is simply not worth it. That small driver doesn't really compare to a good over-the-ear type headphone set."
2,Overpriced and underperforms,"Contrary to the advertising, the sound quality of these headphones is poor at the low end and I did not find them very comfortable to wear. Unfortunately, I couldn't find this out until I tried them and once you open the seal they cannot be returned."
4,Dated but fun,"These books are nearly 5 decades old, and even with the end notes, they still feel very dated. But they give the kids a view of London, and they are entertaining. I'd love to see an updated version, not just annotated."
4,"Good, but there's better...","This is a good CD but it weights in at only 41 minutes which is inexcusably short for a ""live"" CD; I mean, this guy probably jammed all night! And, though it was recorded live at Junior Kimbrough's Juke Joint, it was subsequently cleaned up at Fat Possum Studios which is why it doesn't have much of a ""live"" feel--there's hardly any audience or background noise which can add to the excitment of the recording.A much better, and longer (53 minutes), Burnside CD is ""Burnside On Burnside"", which was also recorded live but has all of the electricity of a live peformance. If you can afford only one Burnside CD then ""Burnside On Burnside"" is the one to get."
5,6 Stars,"Hard to believe this record came out over 10 years ago and now both the producer and the artist are dead. RIP, RL! You were the root, the blues walking and talking like a man. Anyone who doesn't own this record should purchase it immediately and play at maximum volume while making love to someone else's woman."
4,Easily R.L.'s best,"""Too Bad Jim"" absolutely pummels ""Mr. Wizard"" and any other R.L. Burnside discs that feature strange white-boy rockers John Spencer Blues Explosion (there's nothing ""blues"" about Spencer). This is the real deal. Droning, hypnotic Mississippi hill country blues, ""Too Bad Jim"" reaches for the old instead of courting the new and the disc is the richer because of it. Burnside covers Lightnin' Hopkins and traditional songs, molding each cut into his own unique style. He is always worth listening to, but those more recent attempts to be hip can't hold a candle to this."
2,not on my A list,I like blues and listen to the greats such as Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker. This recording is not on a par with these artists better work. It is also badly recorded and painfull to listen to on a decent system. You can find much better and I don't understand the previous reviews.
5,New voice for an old Ampeg,"After a short burn-in period, my old 1966 Ampeg Gemini VI found her original voice; clean, clear, and pristine... but now with a modicum of punch. A new- old- stock Sylvania 7591A is best but impossible to find and megabucks if found. The EH 7591A is a fitting replacement that sounds good. The J.J. 7591S has less punch but is more ""musical"" at the cost of about 15%-20% less power. You can't go wrong with either. Buy two sets as we don't know how long production will last."
5,The best text for dummies on child intellectual development,"I haven't even finished the book yet and I'm raving. The author strikes a perfect balance between too dogmatic (""do it this way""), and too technical (""studies have shown...""). Dr. Jacob cites many studies and experiments to support his points, but does not leave you to wallow in information overflow. He then recommends specific activities you can engage your baby in to enhance intellectual development. No silver bullets, no unsubstantiated claims, but a well examined and researched theory and practice for the lay person. I'm buying several copies for friends and relatives who are interested in giving their baby the best care like I do for my 11 month old daughter. I only wish I had read it sooner!"
4,Biting satire,"Perhaps the most famous work included is ""An argument against abolishing Christianity"", in which he points out the ""Inconveniences"" of abolishing Christianity. Why even ""The Bank of East India Stock my fall at least one per cent"". As a clergy, Swift wants to skewer the Enlightenment deism project of a rational religion.Some of the other essays are more humorous, such as ""A meditation upon a broomstick"", and who can imagine the proposal of admiring gloves for ladies (made of baby's skin), being published today! The tale of the spider and the bee in the battle of the books, reminded me of Francis Bacon's earlier story of the spider, the ant, and the bee in the Novum Organum. Well I'd better stop now, to quote Swift ""Some people take more care to hide their wisdom than their folly""."
2,"Points for imagination, BUT...","I have to say I really was not impressed and am having a very hard time understanding what people saw in this book. The story is definitely imaginative, but I found the writing itself to be flat and uninteresting. I wasn't scared and furthermore, at no point was I persuaded that I should actually care about any of the characters. And the thing with the eyes? Too hokey. The imagery was indeed vivid but the language used to describe it could have been much more compelling."
4,Mr. Johnson's Incredible Autobiography,"Learn all you want about the first black HW champion. From his early days in Galveston, TX to his domination of the Tommy Burns to win the championship, get the scoop from the man himself. This was originally published in 1927, so 20 years or so of his later life are missing. That doesn't take away from Mr. Johnson's excellent tome. The only caution you should observe is not to take everything written as the gospel truth. This reprint has footnotes by the editor to warn of any inconsitencies, so you will be fairly safe. A must read for any boxing fan."
2,Lara Croft Tomb Raider Legend,This game was a bit of a dissapointment I much prefer the playstation version. The game is sort of fun but slightly repettitive and the in game instructions are a waste of time they don't quite explain how to do surtain things well enough.I had some difficulty at first trying to figure out some of the end goals for surtain levels in this game as well. I rate it 2 stars.
3,no title,"A very curious book, in which you can definitely perceive the seeds of his later work. As a social commentary, it is probably invaluable in its description of the truly wealthy in 1913, before there was any income tax. I doubt that even today there is a whole lot of difference. But, again, he's so pedantic, it's almost as if Train were lecturing us on the state of our lives and morals. Not that he isn't right, probably, but he's so holier-than-thou about it. There is no author on the title page, as Train, rather ingeniously, sought to make the book seem an anonymous autobiography of a 50-year-old man searching his life. Boy! does it come up wanting! I wonder how popular it was. Ending, like ""The World and Thomas Kelly"", just too, too sappy. But the life he led. Wow! The money spent and yet the lack of love and warmth in his life."
2,product nicked up,"The SOG Tomhawk arrived on time, but the package was torn and the bladeis nicked up badly. I am keeping it because I don't like to wait."
3,Ttomahawk,Good Product currently being used as a self defense equipment.Pros: Sharp and portable.Con: The case is cheaply rip it on the first day made thus the reason S.O.G. sells a separate heavy duty case for and additional $25-30Overall could be better
5,For my use it's great ..,"I need a small emergency kit hatchet - and for that it does the job. It is light, and compact."
4,great for throwing,"i got to ""play"" with this hawk for a few days. (lent from a friend to sharpen for him). and found it to be a blast to throw! not much else though. steel held up decent and didnt really notice any ""play"" after throwing it at a hardwood tree a good 200 times! missing more then a few times haha. but over all i recommend this tomahawk for throwing not really for any type of wood work. such as splitting wood and survival/camping/hiking chores like that."
4,Work Horse!,"Great tomahawk! I used it to make a primitive log shelter and had 2 other hatchets, but this tomahawk did what the other 2 couldn't which ended up being most of the work. Never got dull or dented. It cut logs like butter. It is super light. The only problem I had was the handle is hard and I got a few blisters working with it, but I put on gloves and it was fine. SOG did a great job with this tomahawk!"
4,SOG Tac Tomahawk,"little heavier than expected and the cutting surface could be bigger (though it is crazy sharp), but all in all for the price an awesome buy. Should work well down range."
4,Better than expected,Arrived a week quicker than I expected. Sturdier than I expected. Have yet to try it out and curious to see how it holds up.
4,Great Product for the Price!,"Not sure why I needed one, but had an itch to buy a tactical tomahawk one night and so I bought this item. I am impressed by how well it takes a beating, especially for a 20+ dollar item. It relieved my mental itch and also was a great introduction to the world of tactical tomahawks."
2,BROKE WITHIN A WEEK,i bought this hawk with intention to throw it... after about a week of heavy use the head broke right off!!!!! Apparently it has a life time warranty. but all the same im extremely upset
4,Not for everyone,I realize that a tactical tomahawk is not cut out for everyone but it was the perfect item for me. My son collects and uses weapons od warfare from current day tactical weapons to mid-evil armour. The SOG tactical tomahawk was not only something that he did not have but is also something that he will take with him in the field. The quality and workmanship was more than what i was expecting. It is a fuctional and sturdy tool that he will not hesitate to use in a given situation.
4,Nice Tomahawk,"Well unfortunatly I can't give an accurate review because I purchased this for a friend. It felt very solid, was very sharp. I felt that the handle needed somthing to help stay in your hand so I tied some parachute cord to the lanyard hole for a wrist strap. It seems that if you were using it and got sweety hands it would just fly right out, they really need some type of extra coating for your grip. Otherwise looked and felt realy good. Could realy do some damage to what ever you aimed at."
2,wobbles,the head chipped while clearing brush.it wobbled thru the air when thrown.the blade does handle small limbs nicely.
2,Blade is more fragile than storebought hatchet,Blade got nicked the first couple of days. It must have hit a small rock when I was hacking around in the brush. What a disappointment.
3,way overrated!,"This must be one of the most overrated items on amazon. It looks cool, thats why I bought it, but it does not perform. I own several other tomahawks and they all throw and chop way better than this one. The flat/straight blade design does not work well at all and it is not balanced well for throwing. This steel does not hold an edge well like high carbon steel. The only positives are the price and that it is pretty much indestructable, this handle will not brake (unlike wooden ones). Over all this is just a cool looking, gimicky hawk and for real use and performance there are many better options out there."
1,Fake,"A forgery, not the real F01. The head is slightly wrong and the handle snapped the first time I used it. Don't buy this!"
4,Cool,So far(3 trips) this has held up well in both camp use and throwing. For a toy/tool combo this is hard to beat; if you are looking for a serious hawk there are better ones out there. The edge has held nicely while trimming branches and being stuck in pine targets. I would wrap the handle in grip tape as it can get a little slick.
1,Not worth it,"I received this item as a gift for christmas and within three uses, right between where the two screws on the handle are, it snapped. The reason for it snapping? It was made with a very cheap type of steel. I was using it on wood and chop number 3 snapped it and it flew off. Very dangerous. Just to clarify further, this is the product I purchased, so I am not mixing up the two versions of this."
4,Quality Tomahawk for the price,I couldn't beat this for the price I paid for it. I like the quality of the construction. It feels really good in my hand. The material it is made of has a quality feel to it.
4,Great tool.!,Got it for a gift but took a look at it and should have ordered myself one. Great looking tool and is light weight. All boogie bags should have one.
5,Awesome!,"My son and I have been out throwing this at everything. It has a good weight, well made. Good size. Nice looking. Sticks in wood if you aim right, chops at it if near miss. It's plenty sharp. We are not experts in this area but we would both recommend this tomahawk! I think I will buy another for myself."
3,it was ok till it broke,"i was using this outside, clearing some fallen branches from a storm, and was whacking on a 3 inch limb. then the head snapped off. i contacted seller and they send me a refund (replacement wasn't available). i ended up gettign a cold steel trail hawk, i like it alot more"
2,"Great price, misleading picture description!","Per the S.O.G Web site this model F01T is made in China. Great price compared to the manufacturer website, saved 50 percent off. Blade came burred due to nylon sheath rivet touched the blade during shipping, nothing a quick pass by a stone grinder won't fix. I'm a bit confused with the pictures provided by the manufacturer and the seller.The one that was shipped to me is not the Fusion by S. O. G., but its the same length as the one on the manufacturer's website as the F01T. The one shipped to me does not say Fusion by S.O.G.http://sogknives.com/store/F01T_tomahawk.htmlcomparison of F06-N Fast Hawk Tactical Tomahawk and F01T[...]"
3,SSG,"Deploying to the ""Stan"" and will probably buy two. I always do that with this type of gear. I have been told that a tool such as this can come in handy in this part of the world by many men who should be listened too on such matters. It sounds like several of the negative reviews are from campers. Well keep buying fellas, it pays the salaries of engineers and metalurgists who develop these things. Look.... this is for breaching, field craft, and when the fecal matter makes contact with the air circulator. Not to mention hey....its a tomahawk, cool right. Lets move production back to the states if at all possible. Just thoughts. Thanks for your time. SOG is hopefully a troop oriented company if so they are worth your buck."
2,"Marginal, Light Weight Tomahawk Easy to Break","I own the SOG Fusion Tomahawk along with several of the Cold Steel Tomahawks. The SOG Fusion Tomahawk is too light and flimsy. Drilling several holes in the blade of the hawk is a really dumb idea - it lightens the hawk and makes it weaker and easier to bend/break. I don't care for the plastic handle - it is easy to break and has a lousy grip. At a minimum, it needs 550 cord wrapped around the handle as the grooved grip is very uncomfortable. Wood handles are better. If you need a spiked tomahawk, get one of the Cold Steel Vietnam Tomahawks. Of all of my hawks, I like the Cold Steel Rifleman's Hawk the best.I would not use this for combat."
3,Lack of planning....,"This has turned out to be a pretty good tool...however, who was it that thought covering the blade edge with a hard, clear plastic coating was a good idea? The very first use of this hawk, and the plastic coating on the edge was mangled, and looks like hell. That would not be a problem if there some simple way to get the rest of the damaged plastic off of the blade, but of course there isn't. I found that dismantling the tool, using paint stripper to remove the remaining plastic as well as the finish on the rest of the blade was the most expedient method. Then a treatment with KG GunKote in your choice of color, I did matt black, and now this tool is as it should be. If it had come without the plastic I would have likely given it 5 stars, but the plastic just shows a lack of forethought. I guess that they were just concerned that it would not survive the long trip from China, even though it's made of Stainless Steel."
3,Does not meet expectations,"This is a tiny hatchet, size is perhaps for a 3-5 year old child. It is not the Droid you're looking for."
2,Dont throw it!,"Nice tomahawk made well but not for throwing as it will damage it!up by the top of the handle, so it,s just eye candy now and a close combat weapon!"
4,SOG Tactical Tomahawk,"Nice! It came out of the box as sharp as my SOG Fusion folding blade! It has good balance, and can be thrown with fairly good accuracy. I don't recommend using it as a throwing tomahawk, however. There are cheaper 'hawks that can be used for recreational throwing, but if the chips are down and you do need to throw it, it'll not let you down. It will make a great camping/hunting companion as a kindling maker or last stand self-defense, personal and up close weapon."
5,"SOG Fusion is practical, easy to carry, and useful","I was watching a Hickok45 video on throwing tomahawks and axes and got inspired to buy this from Amazon. It came on time, easily packaged, and was so useful I carry it in the car. I used it after a storm to clear debris, cleared limbs from my horse's electric fence pathway to avoid short circuits, and it can be thrown, but I am not good at it. It fits my hand well and has held up to quick use due to storms in our area. I can recommend it to anyone who likes quality equipment that can help your camp ground, or a game throwing at a target."
5,Great quality,This is a quality product. I gave it to a friend as a gift and he is afraid to show his children.
5,My SOG F01T is up and online..,"Received my SOG F01T Tomahawk today and am very impressed. Has a very nice weight, balance and feel to it.. Definitely has one purpose and it is not for work around the campsite.. My only complaint is the scabbard could be designed better.. It has one loop which will allow it to swing around on your belt or pack.. A Molle style setup would solve this problem and make it more versatile.. As far at the Tomahawk goes ,it is built very well and I look forward to many years of service.. SOG never fails to impress.."
4,Perfect trail Tomahawk,Got this in the mail today out of the box first thing I noticed was wow this hawk is light very light also it has a sharp edge I know because I was the first thing it cut. The holster work's for protecting the blade or you if your a bit clumsy its no good for the belt tough its to narrow to give any with the body and when you walk around the snap's get pulled apart dropping the hawk at your feet. ant got a chance to see how tuff this thing is yet though.Pro'sLightCompactsharp out of the boxcon'sHolster open's if used on the beltGet an axe belt loop or use a rope and make one.Seems great so far.
5,"Great Tool, Just What it is described as","Looking at some of the reviews I wondered if this was truly a deal. I checked it out at a recent gun show. It is well made, strong, and has a metal band that is at the weak point where the handle meets the head, this gives extra strength where axes always breakdown. The handle is banded with grooves that give good hold barehanded, with gloves, or wet. The axe edge is very sharp, as someone noted it will shave your arms. I was able to make 3/4""-1"" cuts in seasoned hardwood with only moderately hard swings. The point is thicker and very durable, I think the handle will last as long as the head. Very well made piece."
5,great tomahawk,"Fast shipping, great weight and balance to the ax. Very sharp right out of package, great product. Recommed to anyone wishing to add to their Zombie defense surplus."
4,Stupendous,Very solidly made. Comes sharpen. Weigh just nice for outdoor use. China manufacure though. Handle could be made less 'slippy'.
5,F01T Tactical Tomahawk,"Usually when you read description from manufacturer its all praise and then you open the box you start seeing bugs everywhere. There are NO bugs on this one, what the description says is what you get. I use it for camping mainly , learning to throw it (VERY slowly :D )and gave it some abuse breaking bricks and chopping some cans and plastic stuff to test the blade and spike - went through everything and stayed reasonably sharp, no dents in it. Fits in hand perfectly ( I added a piece of paracord to loop around wrist) , well balanced and sturdy. Very handy tool/weapon to have around, excellent price too, definitely recommended."
4,Great hawk,It was great exept for the sheath. The belt loop part fell off after 20 minutes of use. The axe itself has held up great after me chopping wood and throwing it at trees.
5,Great value,Great value and well made. Sheath is a bit of a concern although I haven't had a chance to test it yet. Axe head enters from bottom with snaps to hold it in place. Seems like it could easily become dislodged and drop out of sheath.
3,Sharp and different.,"all and all, not a bad tomahawk. The sheath that it comes with is absolutely terrible. When it's on a belt, make sure not to move to quickly. I had to sprint with it on my hip and it came out, almost going into my knee. BEWARE! As a camping tool; worthless, just get a good hatchet or a tomahawk without a spike. As a self defense tool; useful but you will have to practice as to not drive the spike into your own arm, leg, or head. The blade is sharp and makes short work of kindling and small logs, but the steel is soft and has to be sharpened regularly. The hammer on the side was useful for driving tent pegs, but the back side of a camp hatchet would better serve that task. It is light and fast in the hand. I would recommend a lanyard tied on to wrap around your hand as the grip on it can get slippery with sweat or rain."
2,"Awesome, but not.",So I went to my local sporting goods store and was excited to see the SOG Tomahawk in stock. I immediately asked the counter person to take one out for me. I couldn't wait to get home to check out so I took it out of the packaging in the parking lot. I got home and took a couple tosses at the log I throes knives into and it throws nice. BUT on my 7th toss the handle broke right off. I.am very disappointed. If you want a tomahawk buy the Battle Axe. That's what I should have done.
5,Tomahawk throwing,"I am a beginner on learning how to throw a tomahawk, so I was initially worried that I would ruin the handle when i miss or throw it wrongly as i have heard thats what happens with most of the wooden handles, but i was surprise that these handles were pretty sturdy and held up all my beginner mistakes and heavy duty work. It would also be useful for all the cutting work around the house and backyard. I am definjitely considering buying another one for my practice."
2,sheath stinks,"Bought this to mail to Army bud in Afghanistan. Got it and spent all of five minutes with it before noticing that sheath stinks! Rivets pulling out of poor quality materials that were coming apart. NOT GOOD TO GO! Hawk itself seemed good, but sheath was a deal breaker, wish it came with kydex or at least good quality nylon. Hawk felt good in the hand and at around $37 not bad, but sheath was BAD. Come on SOG you make good stuff, but who made the sheath? I hope this gets fixed. our guys and gals need good gear. Not fit as is for deployment. would be ok in vehicle, but sheath can not be trusted!"
5,Another great product by SOG!!,"SOG has done it again with a well built, quality tool. Excellent workmanship on this tool. I've come to expect nothing else from SOG. Definitely the industry leader."
4,Look pretty cool,"Got this as a gift for a couple buddies for the holidays, they are pretty slender and small. They pack a punch though, they have no problem sticking in a tree. When you throw them you can hear the tomahawk whistling through the air, its pretty sweet!"
5,Jan,"This is a very good product, the knife part is not sharp, but I suppose that you can make it sharp, I do not need this to be very sharp now, because we may only use it during summer camp. No regret, recommend people buy it."
5,Great value for the $$$,"So I'm new to this whole tomahawk thing. I'm normally a gun guy, but had to order one of these, as I heard they are a lot of fun to throw, and also great for getting into or out of a tight jamb.Heck, even seeing someone coming at me with one of these weapons would make me run the other direction, kind of that old Cowboy and Indians thing I guess!Seems well made, and compared to the higher priced models, I'd say a very good value. The only other thing that would make it better, from what I know of knife manufacturing, is a full tang, but the one with full metal tangs are pretty pricy.So for my first 'hawk, I'll play with this one and see if I can at least avoid putting any holes in my and my loved ones before worrying about bigger or better (and more expensive)."
5,Very handy,"Great product from a great company. The tomahawk has great balance, good blade, good pick and good cover. This tool should meet all your needs."
2,Big Disappointment!,"From its writeup, I expected a well-balanced, well thought-out, state-of-the-art tool........NOT!I consider my hands to be ""small-large"". Even so, the handle felt too small in diameter for my comfort. That, coupled its being ""top-heavy"", made using it feel awkward and uncomfortable. Cheap hatchets from a discount store have felt much more user-friendly."
5,Nice hefty Tomahawk,"Haven't had a chance to use yet.It's a little bigger than I had hoped, seems well made. Sharp. I don't like thecase, it seems like it would be awkward hanging from your hip on a belt.I wanted something for day hiking and to use formaking walking staffs. I plan to keep thisone for bigger jobs and ordered the smaller F06which I believe will fit my needs better.The F01 for true camping and larger jobs? The F06 for day hikes and small tasks?JJ4/26/12 update Took this bad boy hiking yesterday and it made quick work of the branchesI cut. I was SURPRISED by how fast it was able to cut thru a 3 inch branch 2-3 whacks, couldhave been 1 if I was really trying. Nice and handy, not as heavy in the day pack as I thoughtit would be."
2,sog tactical tomahawk,"dont buy this for throwing the ''BALLISTIC POLYMER BROKE IN HALF , sog is a chineese piece of crap company"
3,Is it a toy or tool?,"First, two rivets on the head is not enough. Trying to get the head to stick in a stump, and I can feel the handle wiggle and move. I don't trust this axe for normal use. As a throwing toy, maybe, but not as a breach tool or hatchet. I got the M48, and everything is so much better, three rivets equal a more secure handle. The notch halfway down makes the handle a little more secure. The rounded blade on the M48 gives it more surface and angles to contact with the wood. The SOG is a little too simple, and a little too toyish."
1,What kind of reviews are these???,I wanted an axe that I could not only throw but could also chop trees and trim shooting lanes when I need to. I was to be using it at the deer lease mostly. I chose this one due to its good reviews but honestly the ppl who reviewed it have no idea what their talking about. The cheap metal blade comes sharp and the shipping is extremely fast but the blade bends and breaks with normal wear and tear. It's cheap metal. As far a throwing it is concerned... Don't even bother. I broke 2 of them in less than an hour. The handles are cheaply made and break easily. I've had plastic forks that were more durable. The best use is to mount it over the fire place and hope that all the weight from the dust doesn't break it.
3,L.A.R.K.ers beware,"This product is incredible for slaying Orcs. I've also been forced to use it when my Bo Staff broke and I was being attacked by a wounded Lyger. I would have to say that I prefer throwing stars to this hatchet when fending off flying attackers however. Also, a tip for the rest of you, two hatchets can be attached by small chain allowing you to wield a wicked set of nunchuks."
2,it is made for looks,"i have held this hatchet and looked it over pretty good it has a very thick blade almost 1/4 inch thick awesome if u bought it to fight with for combat but do not buy this if u want a throwing hatchet its so thick it wont stick and the handle will brake you need a throwing hatchet handle to be able to slip out of the head of the axe if it is thrown wrong the force made by hitting the tree or target will brake this handle very easy COLD STEEL makes a line of awesome hatchets that i love they hold a great edge and you can buy new handles for cheap like 8 bucks! the rifleman,norse( a brand of axe by CS) is great for throwing the blade is flared and sticks every time 60% of the time..lol..jk but really the cold steel norse hatchet is made for throwing and this is modeled after the veitnam fighting axe in the late 60's"
5,Tantalizing pictures with deliciously entertaining text,"If you are looking for a perfect cookbook for a cookbook collector, this is one they will value highly. Pictures burst from the page and are refreshingly surrounded with intersting tidbits and realistic recipes.The layout is superb and each subject is nicely highlighted for easy location while you page through 629 pages of intoxicating inspiration. The cover is practical with a plastic sheath and the book will open and stay that way on your counter.The type is easy to read with plenty of bold text for emphasis. I cannot give enough positive comments about this book. You will love it.~The Rebecca Review"
4,A very good overall culinary reference book,"Jane Horn's ""Cooking A to Z"" is a fine culinary reference. Almost every entry for a food item includes advice on use, selection, storage, and seasonal availability. While recipes abound, there is a distracting inconsistency on the use of numbers-sometimes they are spelled out (one cup), and sometimes they are listed numerically (1 cup). This is especially annoying with fractions, which are spelled out throughout the book.Still, this volume has its priorities straight, for the most part, and devotes generous space to the simple foundations of good cooking: the humble egg, knives and knife technique, and so on. Overall, this is intelligently designed and gorgeously photographed."
1,Don't waste your money...,"I normally don't do reviews, but this is one product I feel the need to write about. I have always bought cheap earpieces because they seem to last at least 6 months before I have to replace them which is fine. This particular one worked for 3 days before it broke. I couldn't hear anyone and they couldn't hear me, it wound up in the trash. Even though its inexpensive, don't waste your money.."
3,It works.... sorta?,"This product what it is supposed to do, it adjust the sounds across the sound spectrum. Now that's all fine and dandy but what did not work was there Graphic display.It displayed the input level, but not the actual adjustments in the spectrum. No matter how much you increase the Bass, or if you just completely cut out the highs and mids the spectrum will still look the same on the display even though it will sound different.Another thing was that some of the lights on display screen were dim from when i opened the box. You could see them but they were obviously dimmer than their surrounding lights. That can't get any better only worse.. i really hope it holds up. Another point is that BOY those LED's (in each slider) are bright. It doesn't matter the venue, you'll be able to see your EQ display and sliders, and there's no way to turn them down.I'm sticking with it cause hey, it works wel,l for the $75 i shelled out for it."
1,Very cheap!!,The blue lights were blinding and the graphic display was upside down. Bad quality!! I would not purchase this item.
3,Pyle-Pro PPEQ100 review,"The product is OK, I wish it would have made a bigger difference in the sound quality. Overall, the product is average in performance. The blue lights are a bit bright and not necessary, they glare your vision when you're adjusting the levels. I guess the price is OK for what your getting. I would consider a better unit for the more serious music enthusiast."
4,ALMOST 5 STARS!,"If you like surf-inspired punk rock, this is the album for you! Produced by Fletcher from Pennywise, this has a MUCH better sound quality than ""Yuppie Ghetto"". I'm sure this will grow on you as much as it has me. I highly recommend!"
5,An excellent how-to on JCL for MVS/ESA,"This excellent book is for novice through experienced programmers. It includes information on the more recent releases of MVS, including SMS and its impact to JCL. While the text is good reading, it is also useful as a reference book."
1,Bitter Dissapointment!,"I was so looking forward to not lugging my PC. The wheels are so noisy that I am embarssed to roll it thru the airport. I thought in the store that it had the inline skate wheels, but instead they are hard plastic look-alikes."
1,Needs lot of other spices to complete 'masala',"It says add cumin, cinnamon, cardamom, clove .. etc..I need something easy ... looks like this one needs all other spices that have to be bought separately"
1,NOT THE ORIGINAL!!!!!,THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE IN BEN E. KING'S SOUND AS RECORDED IN THE 1960'S AND THIS REMAKE. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!
3,Father's input doesn't change outcome,"Dentist Kenneth Taylor murders his wife Teresa 4 months after she gives birth to their first child and then drives for several days with her body in the trunk. This author had Taylor's cooperation and tries to give the story from the father's point of view. Even though Taylor cooperated with the author it couldn't dredge any sympathy for him. The real trouble starts when Taylor, after he is convicted, has his parents take the child back to their home and illegally adopt him to keep him from his wife's sister. It was almost two books in one book. I have also read In a Child's name by Peter Maas for the same story and found that book compelling also."
4,THE LAWRENCE YOU ONLY THOUGHT YOU KNEW,"While the psycho-sexual kinks of Lawrence of Arabia may be a startling revelation to those who know him primarily through the David Lean epic (and who were oblivious to that film's subtle sub-text) this is nevertheless an extremely well-written novel that fills in the blanks of Lawrence's inner life with authority and empathy, making for a highly credible, involving read in the tradition of Gore Vidal's historical series. The chapters involving Charlotte Shaw and her interviews with Lawrence's mother and King Feisal are exceptional. A unique and controversial take on Lawrence that is sure to unhinge purists but is well worth their temporary apoplexy."
1,Awful,"This book is an awful mishmash of the author's fantasies and the rumours which surrounded (and continue to surround) T.E. Lawrence during his life and after his early death. The author claims to offer insight into Lawrence's life after Arabia: I can reccommend a far better source of insight (and a far superior book): Lawrence's autobiographical book, The Mint, written during his time in the RAF. If you want the ""truth"" about Lawrence after Arabia, read what Lawrence had to say!"
1,What A Joke!,"This book is nothing but a minimally researched--if at all--set of the author's fantasies. Much of T.E. Lawrence's life, after Arabia, is shrouded in mystery; a book on the reality of this period of Lawrence's life could be valuable. This book, however, is a mishmash of fictitious characters, events and psycho-sexual idiocies, all springing from the author's psyche--not Lawrence's In fact, the Lawrence of this book is as fictitious as many of the other characters in the book. Do not buy.."
2,takes some sort of talent to make Lawrence of Arabia boring,"Granted my expectations weren't exactly high, but this book really disappointed me. Normally I thoroughly enjoy fictional autobiographies, such as ""I Claudius,"" or ""The Autobiography of Henry VIII,"" or the Roman series by Allan Massie. What sets them apart from this one? A believable narrative voice. I could accept that Henry VIII would say this, or that Augustus would say that. I simpy cannot accept that the T. E. Lawrence whose books and letters I have been reading for years would speak with the voice Stevens has given him here. This is the voice of a blunt post-Stonewall sensibility, not the voice of an evasive Victorian-born, Great Depression-died man, no matter how one interprets his personal psychology. I don't mind a gay Lawrence; I do mind a silly one.Only the inherent interest of the subject is earning 2 stars out of me."
3,Ego Maximus ???,"OK ... The video and audio quality of this BD is top notch and you'll not be disappointed in that arena.But the concert itself i found very nuaseating which is why i gave the overall 3-stars. David Foster kept on saying ""I....I.....I"", endlessly talking about his accomplishments ad-nauseum. I mean, it was as though he put on a concert to remind people how wonderful and brilliant he was at creating all the music hits of the 80s and 90s in all musical styles. It really felt like a eulogy that he was giving himself!!! This is what turned me off the whole concert. Your friends and colleagues are supposed to give you the praise and speak nice and wonderful things about you and what you've done for them in their lives. But if you put on a show and talk about yourself for more than 2 hours ... i mean it really became awful. So you've been warned!!!"
5,A model of how BluRay audio and video should be done,"This concert and this recording are a real gems. The concert itself has many great talents and the songs are well-chosen and performed. The audio is truly superb with perfect mixing of voice and instruments, and there is very satisfying surround channel content. I just bought it, but it is already one of my favorite BluRays. The disc would be a great choice to demonstrate any home theatre. Even the menu system on the disc is well-designed. I'd give it 6 stars if I could."
5,Satisfied customer,A quality DVD presentation enhanced by blue-ray technology makes this a very special video. I would highly recommend this product for anyone who may have been considering purchasing this extremely entertaining PBS special.
3,Hit man David Foster,"I am sure this is a great album, but unfortunately I bought it in Blu Ray (by mistake) my DVD recorderdoesn't play this type.I will have to buy another one to comment"
2,It moves along very slowly.,This video has some great artists on it but it is just not very exciting
5,Great transaction,Delivered on time and well wrappedFantastic concert for all music fansStar studded event with some great performances.This is a must own for all Pop music fans of the last 30 years.It's amazing how many pop icons David Foster has produced and the title Hit Man is about rightYou won't be sorry if you purchase this Blu Ray as the sound and picture quality are both superbEnjoy
5,So full of details!,"My interest in Russian literature began 35 years ago with the discovery of a Russian writer whose work was so very different from Tolsoy, Turgenev, and Gogal,...Anton Chekhov. I own, and have read many times, four different author's views on the life of Antosha. Philip Callow's book gives so many new details about Chekhov, that one comes away with a new perspective into the personality of this magnificent writer. If you are enjoy reading Chekhov and about Chekhov, I heartally recommend this book!"
1,Hero-worship rather than scholarship,"To some extent, the act of writing a biography is inherently celebratory. But Callow's worshipful attitude towards his subject creates a bland, two-dimensional representation of the man. It reads less like scholarship than hero-worship (...).Callow's appreciation of Chekov's genius and his praise for the artist are not unseemly, but the too-facile manner in which he deflects the many criticisms leveled against Chekov make us lose sight of the ""other Chekov,"" the inglorious one, who is equally as important, if often less attractive, than the idealized man Callow presents.In addition--and almost an afterthought in light of the failings described above--Callow's analyses of Chekov's work are often obtuse and, almost without exception, unoriginal."
5,Unique artist,"This guy really knows how to throw music together and he makes it seem all improvised. Mainly focused on the instruments, this album is pretty easy to listen to. It's one of those albums that you can work, IMO."
5,Highly Recommended!!!,"Absolutely the most beautiful girls in ANY Something Weird Video I own. And that's saying something believe me...I currently own almost 40 Something Weird DVD's and counting, but this one(both movies in the set) have the best dancing and the most beautiful late 60's women I have seen thus far. Just awe inspiring. I don't even know what the films were about after the first viewing. I was mesmorized by the women too much I guess. I do however remember a really funny and fowlmouthed cussing old man in the first film that made me laugh after he sold off his lovely step daughter to some creep for $50 cash. haha! What a deal. Anyway, I highly recommend that if you like Something Weird Videos late 60's sexploitation genre that you buy this DVD as quick as you can. You will not regret it! Enjoy! -Chris, Florida"
3,Buy this plus another interview book as a supplement,"I read this book cover-to-cover. Sure it makes you think of what you need to say in an interview. However the overall feel of the book is that it is geared towards young newbie teachers and therefore is a bit ""cutsy."" You have to read through a lot of dialogue to try to get to the meat of the book, which should be to answer the interview questions correctly. Unfortunately, it doesn't accomplish this. It is a good book to prepare you FOR the interviews and different scenarios, but never REALLY covers the many questions that could be asked, except in a vague way.After reading this book I bought Acing the Interview by Tony Beshara. It has 450 interview questions, 80% of which can be used in teaching interviews. Loved that!"
3,"Well Organized, but already dated",This book came out just as the final version of NT Option Pack was released. It shows. Some of the screen shots are from Beta 3 of IIS 4 which is problematic given that the product changed between Beta 3 and final release. Wait for the Microsoft book if you can.
2,Insufficient details for MCSE 80-087 Exam.,"This book is not orgainzed properly. Secondly it is an overview of IIS 4.0, might be good for beginners but doesn't cover the details. As others have already pointed out that it assumes the Beta version of IIS. It tells about the programming details which is not appropriate while discussing IIS installation. Waste of money as far as I am concerned."
2,Too general - no specific information,"This book contains helpful information about setting up IIS4 and it's many components, but doesn't spend enough time talking about IIS4 administration and support. If that's what you're looking for, don't buy this book."
2,A high level technical reference book,"Although this appears to be one of the better books on IIS 4.0, much of the information in this book was taken from Beta 1/2, and has been outdated.. I was looking for step-by-step direction on how to use IIS 4.0, but this book offers more of a general guild-line of how to go about things. If money isn't not an issue, having this book is better than nothing. If it is, then you may want to wait for another book that's based on the final release of IIS 4.0."
5,One of the Best Astaire & Rogers films,"I think this is one of my favorite movies of all time. Fred Astaire as the famous ballet dancer, Petrov, is hilarious, especially when he meets Linda Keene (Rogers) for the first time. The entire movie is very funny and will bring a a smile to anyone's face. ""Zoom, Zoom"", ""They Can't Take That Away From Me"", and ""They All Laughed"" are all brilliant. I reccomend this movie to any Astaire & Rogers fan."
2,Too much!,"I've always thought of myself as a person who likes the off the wall books, but this book was a little over the top for me. The author does write beautifully, but I think that her writing is best suited for short stories. There are way too many adjectives in her writing, and the book seems to be weighed down by all the drug use. It jumped all over the place and it just could not keep my attention."
5,Urgent Message From Mother,There has never been a more auspicious time for such a book.I am connecting with like-minded powerful women via www.mercarina.com WHEN (Women's Human Rights and Empowerment Network) WIN (Women's Irish Network)www.marineconnection.org all whom I belong to and all are on the same wavelength whether it be through Arts Education Business Medicine Healing Politics we can all contribute and make a difference and help Men understand that integration can work and power and money are not the essence of life but love and light are. Accountability and Action are key motivators. Women are joining forces every moment every day. Ancient beliefs are coming forward to remind us who we are as we are part of Mother Earth.
1,Poor study guide for the CLEP exam,"This book was not a study guide, as advertised. It is simply a compilation of tests and test answer keys without any explanations. I am sending it back to Amazon.com"
1,TOTAL Waste of Time and Money,This book shouldn't even be sold. It does not help at ALL with trying to learn.. and I don't recall seeing anything that was in this book used in the actual exam. I think the soap opera review teaches more about educational psychology than this junk sandwiched between book covers. My advice: steer clear- it provides absolutely no help.
3,Basic bin works well but over priced,"I bought 3 of these to replace one large pile. One is to add material to, the second is composting, the third is composted material I am using. I rotate through the three bins each year. The material seems to compost fine with total lack of attention. I add leaves, grass clippings, and kitchen scraps.Pros:- They hold up to the Central Texas heat in full sun- Light weight- Easy to set up and easy to move.Cons:- They get a little limp and cave in on themselves in 100+ degrees if less than 2/3 full- Not easy to turn the compost, but then I don't plan to as I am a lazy composter.- You have to have at least 2. One that is composting and one that can be added to.- Too expensive - 3 of these for ~$100 plus expensive shipping. I could buy a small iPod for less than the cost of three sheets of heavy plastic? That seems wrong. The 3 star rating is mostly because of the cost. If they were less than $20 I would give them 5 stars."
4,my favorite composter,"I bought three of these and I love them. They make great compost without any turning. I just layer and then, when i see that the bottom half is done, I remove the hoop. I set it up next to the unhooped pile. Then I pitchfork the stuff that didn't break down yet into the now empty hoop and start all over. One tiny problem I encounter is that, when full, the bottom of the hoop starts to bend. Also, you have to keep ensuring the hoop stays relatively round in shape as you fill it or it will become oval shaped. Otherwise, this method works the best for me in 20 years of composting."
2,Well you know what they say .....,"Well you know what they say when you really want something then you wait a long time to get it , and when you do get it you are always get your hopes uptoo high and wha ypu get is not anything you wanted or expected that goes for this book. I mean it was ok but really i mean Christina is like a walking Snob and the Jealous Queen. What was up with Samantha I thought i Racing Parker she would be riding the racehorses not training them. Melanie is cool but she reminds me of Samantha in too many ways.Samantha to me isa one and only. I also thought they would actuall got to Sam's farm and have a chapter on it now that that is were Christina rides? oh well at least racing is back. and so is Samantha! Does anybody else think Samantha should ride in eventing for the Olympics thats what i hope. Sam never got ,much credit. Anywho that is the scoop on how I rate this book"
3,Not Bad...but still could be better,"This book is certenly an improvement compared to the others, at least we're fianally back to the subject of racing. But still we're missing deatail and meaning, Christina is still there for one thing. If we took her out of the picture these series would be complete. Melanie has some potential in this noval. She seems to be improving and getting down right serious to racing. Samantha though has much disappointed me. She opens some wierd training stable (not thouroughbred training mind you) and expects us all to love her. The entire reason I loved Samantha was becasue she wanted to train racehorses. That's what I want to do and she was sort of like my role model after Bob Baffert. Not anymore, please pick up her act."
4,Pretty Good,"This was a pretty good TB book. I hate how the author portrays Christine and Ashleigh. I also hate the names, uh no offense. 'Pride's Perfection'?? And Seabreeze is a horse for goodness sakes. hehe Tip to the authors: Keep a list of the people's and horse's info. =) Overall, great job. Keep 'em coming!"
5,YYYYAAAAAAAHHHHOOOO!!!!!! RACING IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I just cannot belive it! Racing is back but what is happening to Cindy,Sammy,Tor,and the rest of the origonal characters? I wish Joanna would start writing them again unlike the other authors who stuff every thing up. I love racing!"
2,what happened?,"Well well well, I started reading these books when they first came out I have quite the collection although as soon as Cindy was suddenly gone i lost interest in them. It seems as though she was never really a member of the family of characters that young girls across North America have come to love. My sister is now starting to read the books and has started complaning about how everything always works out. I say its a series so why make every book have a mushy non thought provocing ending. It is to bad that they have changed so much but if people are still reading them all the power to you. Also I LOVE jumping but the whole idea of the thoroughbred books was racing, I just wish that the story lines would stop jumping around so much try to keep your characters and plots the same for a whole year at least."
4,um yeah,"I just have a comment to make about a review written- It was from ""a reader from USA"", titled I want eventing, feb. 15,2000. If you really want eventing, then read a series about eventing. This is a series about RACING. And, by the way, really pay attention to Christina. She can sometimes be nice, as you said, but at other times she is a selfish, spoiled, arrogant brat, and belongs in Townsend company.P.S. Great book- bad facts."
4,forgotten,"another thing I forgot in my Nov.24th review- Chris didn't get into racing because of her mom- it was because of Star. And i don't think that's fair either, to drop eventing and sell sterling so quickly, as if dropping an unwanted toy."
3,"ok, i'm confused","ok, i need some people to e-mail me or write these answers in a review for me, or something, b/c i have no idea what is goin on!!! how does everyone know that joanna campbell has been talkin to these authors? how do u know that she wanted them to change the books so much? please tell me b/c i want to know, so i can see it for myself. and y does everyone think cindy's so bad and snobby, the same w/ christina.and isn't it a little unrealistic in the later books that christina desides 1 day,""hey!! i think i want to sell sterling,be a jockey, and forget my whole dream of being an olympic jumper!!"" i mean, i don't like eventing as much as racing, but u don't right a couple of books about her dream & then suddenly she drops that dream and the books go abruplty back to racing just as abruptly as it came. plus, y in the world did sammy move all the way to IRELAND!!!!!! come on people!!!!"
2,I Want Eventing!,"This book was okay but the author got a lot of things messed up. She didn't give much detail of the characters.I mean what about Cassisy? I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE the eventing stuff. Iwas really getting caught up in Chris, Dylan, and Parker. Chris is so NOT NOT NOT a snob. In the other books she was so nice. I think she sould stick with eventing and not go into racing just because of her mother. They should have more stuff about Sammy and Tor's new stable. What about when Sammy was in Ireland?"
2,Not cool enough,Ive had this for 1 month now and I put the water inside per direction and it just is not getting cool like my last mat that I used to own for 3 years. I cant remember what that brand was but it looks the same and if it was the same brand then either the inside cushion which holds the water may not be made the same way it used to. Im not getting that tight airless feeling although I emptied the air as much as I could.
5,THIS IS A GREAT GUIDE,"Normally I don't review books but because this one is so GREAT I find myself compelled to . I teach HW classes and this book has been a great reference materiel. also for people who want to get a basicunderstanding of ""How the internet Works"". my classes are a little high level and not for everyone but this book is. I have told many people to read it. The Illustrations are the best I have ever seen."
2,"Too much jargon, too simple explanations, don't buy this...",I had to buy this for a class. What a disappointment. It throws out all this jargon but all the explanations are way too superficial. I understand that this is just supposed to be an introduction - but all it did was get me more confused. I was better off when I didn't read the text and just asked people in the field how something works.One good thing is that it is pretty up to date. It discusses the Melissa virus and other recent happenings.
2,bare bones basics,I highly recomend this book for 4 year olds and 80 year olds. This book addresses concepts only and then at the most simplistic of levels. I am not technical and was not looking for a book targeted to programmers. I simply wanted a book that would provide a modicum of information to satisfy a curious mind and give some substantive explanations as to how the internet works. This taught me nothing and is falsey advertised.
5,Great book and diagrams,"Good thorough book explaining the technology and different parts of the Internet. Also, relatively up to date which is impressive with all the changes going on. I will be using this book in my UCLA Extension class, Web Technology Fundamentals."
4,It covers a lot of areas related to the Internet and WWW.,"I got this book to read about the Internet and how things worked behind the scenes. It covers everything from basic to advance topics that include protocols, modems, internet connections etc. Concepts are really explained well using illustrations. I would recommend it for both the beginner and the advanced surfer."
5,An all-time Salsa classic from Sonora Poncena.,"Great Salsa dance tracks like ""La Montana Del Oso"", ""Tumba Mabo"", ""Mayeya"", ""Hachero Sin Hacha"", ""No Muere El Son"" and the absolutely hilarious ""Homenaje a Las gordas"" and ""La Fiesta No Es Para Feos"" make this Cd a must-have for your Salsa collection. Vocalists Luigi Texidor and Miguel Ortiz are very much adept at covering everything from Son Montunos to Guarachas to straight-up Salsa to Boleros. Need I say more? Buy this classic album from 1975 now!!!"
5,Chinchilla Heaven,Our pet chinchilla loves alfalfa. We try to rotate the different hays that we give him but this is his favorite.
3,The bale arrived open.,"The twistie tie was missing and the bale was open. Fortunately, not much of the hay fell out of the bag."
1,Terrible,"This is the worst hay I have ever purchased for my rabits. The hay was so flaky that it fell right out of the dispenser and the animals couldn't eat it unless they wanted to lick it up off the bedding. Usually you always get a little of thins in every small bale but this one was made of that stuff. If you buy it, maybe put it in a dish?"
4,happy,got this for the little ones to eat. small pets love there alfalfa. mine do a happy dance when we put in there cages
3,1 our of three no good,"I ordered 3 packages of this and one of them was made mostly up of alfalfa flakes, not hay. My guinea pigs didnot seem interested in eating the flakes, so I went through that bale very quickly. I guess it served as extra bedding."
1,Dried Out and Way Too Long,"This alfalfa is terrible. It is dried out, stalky and cut way too long. My guinea pigs could eat only about 20% of the product due to it's being so thick and dry. It created a huge mess in the cage. Do not buy this product!"
2,Doesn't seem fresh..,"I ordered this for my 4-month old guinea pig. And the color just seems off. I looked in the picture and noticed that at least SOME of it is supposed to be green and actually fresh looking. In all honesty, it all looks dead. And it is EXTREMELY powdery. I think I'll contact the seller, but seeing as how I already opened it to see if my guinea pig would eat it, I don't know if they'll do anything. I know my guinea pig isn't a big fan of it. 2 stars for it arriving on time."
2,Amazon Verified Purchase,"This is a book of lists, period. As a checklist book its good but for a book on how to build up a pantry it is not."
1,Another Y2K fear mongerer. I'm sending it back.,"Family preparedness has always been important, no more so today. However with the purported ""Y2K"" scare, ""survivalists"", and other fear mongers have a new tool to push their agenda. Having read ""Making the Best of Basics"" I was surprised and saddened that this book uses the same scare tactics so prevalent on the internet and employed by those who stand to profit from ""Y2K"". I was disgusted by the chapter on buying precious metals. I cannot think of a less wise investment for those who truly wish to be prepared"
5,boat tower,Great Product. The easiest way to place fenders on the boat I've found. Easy to adjust. Use them every outting. I don't have to worry about bending railing.
2,"Marylebone: The Keith Trilogy, Book 2","As a member of Clan Keith and having completed a solid genealogical trace as far back as Ol'Hervius circa 1080-1130, I am perhaps too critical of Smith's work. I greatly enjoyed the re-telling and historical novel approach of the first book - Dunnottar. It was splended how Smith incorporated a vast bank of history into this story. The second volume deviated significantly from the historical facts but still had some insight of the times and was a worthy read. The 3 book was simply entirely fiction and although ripe with harlenquinesque romance, was an odd sequence to the first two. While the 1st book should be a must-read for all Keiths, the 3rd would be of only entertainment value. In summary, the series rates a 5, 3, and 1 , respectively. To be fair, I would delete the 3rd book of this series and rate Smith's overall treatment as a solid 4. - Trellan"
3,Great techno/electro/industrial music with a twist,"great novamute album... if you like industrial electro or techno, check this one out. I gave it 3 stars just because some of the tracks are just boring but the good ones are really special."
4,a good light read,"Carole is really happy after the Mountain Trail Overnight. Her horse is great, and she gets to help Veronica with Cobalt. Then Veronica rushes Cobalt over a jump and he dies. Carole's whole world comes crashing down, but Stevie and Lisa are amazed that one horses death can keep her from ridng. This is like many other death-of-a-horse books out there: the horse dies, the girl vows never to ride again, then a magic event turns her bak onto riding. But its good! Really good! They shouldve' ended the SC after about 50 books. They start to loose their originality. Most of the plots are: Veronica's a brat, can the saddle club pay her back? or Sonso rides better than Saddle Club member_____...is she jealous, and--that's pretty much it ..."
1,Horrible,"I really don't like these books. They're more about people relationships compared to horses. They're some of the worst horse books I've ever read. ""Thoroughbred"" books and the ""Ashleigh"" series are way better. I bought some ""Saddle Club"" books before I didn't know about them, I've given them all away. Stay away from these books!"
5,Great but very emotional,This is a WONDERFUL book. I love Saddle Club books and I wish I could read them all. But I can't because I can't find any of them. I have read all of the books in my school library and the public libraries. In this book Veronica DiAngalo a snobby rice girl owns a beutiful thourobreed named Colbalt. Carole (a memdber of the Saddle Club) is in love with him. While Veronica can't take care of her horse Carole exercises Colbalt and even teaches him some new trickes. When Veronica's carelessness cause Colbalt his life Carole thinks she will never ride again. When she comes back to the stables she finds out that the horse she usually rides is going to foal and Colbalt is the father! This is an exciting book and I would recomend it to anyone who loves horses.
4,Quite interesting - but direct and useful!,"Written like a detailed journal of someone who'd gone this way before. My only complaint was that some of the screen-shots were a bit small. But, worst case, you'd just have to follow the whole, prescribed route to see the item in the book more clearly in the actual game."
5,Listen to B-Movie NOW (2006),"Americans are living the consequences of what Mr. Scott-Heron warned of more than twenty years ago.""Mandate, my ass""""What has happened is that, in the last twenty years America has changed from a producer to a consumer""""We used to be a producer ... and now we are consumers, finding it difficult to understand""""Natural resources and minerals will change your world""Unfortunately, most available versions of this song cut the extended outro, the survival mantra :""this ain't really your life; it ain't nothing' but a movie"""
4,Progressive and poignant,"i first found this LP for a pound in a junk bin. i'd heard of Heron and figured that a pound was a safe bet. what i got was a hundred times the value of my money. and definitely worth the much higher price i now have to pay!no other record of his connected with me as fully as this LP did, it is still a superb record and the CD version has done nothing to suck out any of the vinyl quality (thank God!). Grandma's Hands is one of the most evocative love songs i have ever heard and i still treasure it deeply.my only disappointment was the song Morning Thoughts, which now just seems turgid and dull. Other than that, the songs are exceptional, the cover versions - I favor this version of Inner City Blues over any other (sorry, Mr Gaye) - are spot on. All in all, worth every cent that it's cost me to date."
5,Reflections,"This CD is another one of those gems from Gil Scott. Each song has it's on story that can be related to most people. Being fom Louisiana, I remembered that day when Mark Essex shot uo downtown New Orleans. It was indeed an Inter City Blues"" This CD is a must for any Gil Scott fan."
5,Keillor captures winter as no one else can,"The five stories in this CD set are all majestic, and they include every aspect of winter one can think of. ""Guys on ice"" is a rather self-explanatory title, chronicling the thoughts of guys on ice; always interesting. ""James Lundeen's Christmas"" is the story of a boy who finds Christmas as it is truly meant to be. ""Christmas story re-told isn't as magical as it is in the Bible, but Keillor comes as close as one can in his re-telling. ""New Year's from New York"" details Keillor's appreciation for the event from a child's perspective. ""Storm Home"" brings to life the things that can make school and home life tolerable. This is a terrific compilation of Keillor's winter work."
4,Good Chan Entry,This is the one with the cigarette trick! Good entry in the Sidney Toler Chan genre.Good exotic locale for a Chan mystery although most of the film takes place indoors.
4,Brazilian Atmosphere and Cabaret Scenes,CHARLIE CHAN IN RIO is one of two Chan films turned out by 20th Century-Fox in 1941. Sidney Toler plays Charlie who is chasing a killer in Rio. Sen Yung is again cast in the role of Jimmy Chan and Victor Jury also appears in the movie. I liked it - particularly the Brazilian atmosphere and the cabaret scenes.
1,Worse than expected,"This dreadful film--amateurish to the point of laughter--is an example of the inferiority of Twentieth Century Fox Chan films. For real style and laughs, watch the cheapie Monogram Chan movies with Mantan Moorland and Willie Best. The fact that these films are politically incorrect, adds to their appeal."
3,To The Ends of The Earth,If you are into maritime history and the the beginnings of a colony this is a good movie. There are known actors who give a very good perfromance. It shows what life might have been like on board an old sailing ship. It gives a good portrayal of Great Britian's stratified society during the hieght of it's empire.
3,Forgot I saw this,"I saw this on TV, I forgot I saw it and I ordered this DVD. Well it is OK, a typical English drama."
3,DVD - low quality,"This is a good mini series. However, the quality of the DVD is not great. There are sections where the audio is of low quality. This is a problem when you are also trying to decipher the British accents. The video quality on this DVD is also low. That said, it is an interesting romp through the reality of world travel in the days of sail."
5,"If you like sea-going tales, you've got to see it","First of all, who doesn't love Benedict Cumberbatch? This is a great coming of age story about class, pride and the confusion that comes from growing up."
3,Enjoyable Seafaring Journey,"Alot of the icky areas, were just unappetizing.There was alot of buildup for a rushed endingthat did too many things in the final chapter.Compared to the others in the trilogy, this oneis not as good as lord of the flies. i felt the actorsreminded me of cast of the movie master andcommander, yet, they just did not hit the homerunthat it did."
3,Not as good as Id'e hoped,Some reviewers described it as Masterpiece Theatre but the performances of some of the characters left me underwhelmed.Was it just the dialogue or the delivery of some of a host of the most unlikeable characters such as Richard McCabe as Mr Brocklebank?I felt some of the characters were overacted and unconvincing.The gradual transformation of the young condescending aristocrat Edmund Talbot was underplayed and not defined clearly enough and kept back stepping.Just when you think the unlikeable Edmund Talbot has maybe learnt a lesson in life he hadn't.This was evident in a scene with Lieutenant Summers and the sudden reversal of his supposed softening personality when it revealed the Lieutenant had not come from his class.Maybe it has something to do with the less irritating characters they played but I liked the performances of Jared Harris as Captain Anderson and Jaime Sives as Lieutenant Summers the best.
1,Dull,It is a 3 part play about a rich aristocrat's son's voyage to Australia and a government job. The historical facts are sound--the plot is dull and boring. I found the whole 3+ hours way too long and way to dull.I would not recommend buying this DVD.
1,Ooops or We Simply Don't Care About Accuracy,"...and the TV series is in the wrong aspect ratio as is Timeless DVD of The Incredible Journey of Mary Bryant. They are both widescreen not the 1:33:1 ratio Timeless has abridged both of them in. I am so happy so many of you don't care about this and don't mind seeing a bastardised version of these television shows. It restores my faith in humanity. Hey, anyone want to buy a copy of War and Peace without 33% of its pages. I can cut you a deal."
2,No captioning and heavy accents,I can usually watch British productions because the actors speak clearly.This movie has no captions and the accents were too thick.Production appeared to be very good.Sellers should mention whether a movie has captions.
1,DEFINITELY NOT a family film!,I was absolutely compelled to write this review. Nothing could be further from a family film than perhaps porn or some gratuitous gore. This film contains truly shocking sexual subject matter that I cannot imagine any parent would want their child to see. It is unpleasant almost from the beginning and we certainly could not bear to watch it through.
1,boring,There are some very good movies out there but this isn't one of them. We got it because of Sam Neill but even he couldn't help it.
5,A Great Epic Novel,"This is a wonderful book. I'm really surprised there hasn't been a movie or mini-series made of this story. This may bring back the TV mini-series if marketed properly.Little tidbits that I hadn't known about before. The attitude of the people of Berlin during the bombings; the story about Goering(?) going down to the subways during the bombing and making jokes; the description of Zossen; the Zoo flak tower; the last dyas of Hitler, etc. A very interesting read for a long, detailed novel."
2,And what about THE battle of Berlin?,"Of 468 pages, 300 pages cover the forplay to the battle of Berlin, Holocost and other Nazi warcrimes. Very little is written about the Soviet slater of German Civilians. If you are intressted in ""Battle of Berlin"" I recommend other books."
5,Great Read,"The Fall of Berlin is a magnificent account of the last days of the Second World War and the German surrender of their nation to the Soviet Union. I just read it for a second time and think it a valuable contribution to our overall history of that horrific era. No, it is not a comprehensive tale of the Russian 1945 spring campaign, but it certainly provides readers with a dense, richly textured portrait of one of the world's most famous cities and its obliteration from bombing and invasion. Anthony Read is a fine historian and despite my being familiar with several accounts covering the exact same events, most of its stories and first-hand testimony was new to me. The Fall of Berlin is strong on fact but is also a great story...which is precisely what draws us to devouring history in the first place."
5,The war from the perspective of Berliners.,"This is a superb book. I read it in a single (long!) day, found its narrative totally absorbing. So many facts, observations and recollections of life in Berlin both before and during the war. Such a book could have been a dry listing of events, but the authors do the subject credit and make it an excellent read. I remember visitng East Berlin in the late 70's and seeing the still ruined Imperial Capitol buildings. Just like the war had ended yesterday. Its all fixed up now (I assume; haven't been back there since the wall fell), but this book answered many questions I had from that time as to what life there must have been like during wartime. This book proves that good historical scholarship does not have to be boring."
5,Absorbing must read,This is a must read. It gives you a real feel of what is was like for Berliners. The writers take into account the stories of a lot of people who were living in Berlin and their stories of survival. As you keep reading you can almost feel the noose tightening around Berlin and it's inevitable fall to the Russians.
4,Really satisfied,The best dictionnary I found for arabic (and unfortunately no longer printed). Both french and arabic entries. 4 stars for the printing/paper quality wich should be better. Anyway I recommand.

2,Could be a better deal,"The pieces in this set are utter junk. Think of that hollow unbalanced set at the thrift store for .50, and that is what they coupled this game with. I am returning this because its to light weight. You are really paying $15 or so for cards. If this was simply a pack of cards for $7 bucks I would have kept it. The makers of this don't realize how important the feel of moving a chess piece is. I started on a decent semi weighted set and can remember how they feel 30 years later. All in all a great concept but terribly executed. Bad deal!"
5,Pleased with it.,"My boys ages 5 & 6 love the game but cannot play it without supervision. The younger has difficulty losing. Otherwise they could play alone. Hopefully soon! I am learning, as well, thanks to the game. Some of the card instructions were not crystal clear to me but their father, who has a little chess background, helped to clarify for me. If the adult has played chess or researched a bit that helps, IMHO. Overall, a fantastic game with multiple levels of challenge."
4,Beginners dream,"I love that you can use either side, my 6 year old grandson and I really enjoyed it, great way to start the game"
5,No stress chess,"I love this format. Best way to understand basic chess moves quickly. Instructions provide three easy, clear game playing methods that affectively instruct how to command a chess game. Really a great beginners game for all ages. I was glad to finally learn to play at 52!"
3,Eh?,"This set is only so, so. My son hasn't used the cards b/c he wants to learn how to play the REAL way. And he already knows enough to play, albeit poorly. The concept is great but my boys weren't interested. It confused the limited knowledge they already possessed."
5,No Stress Chess,"This was a gift. I had some doubts about it but my son was dead against it, saying his boys (twins) were way too young (they just turned 7). I sent him the link describing it. He changed his mind in a hurry and said it is awesome and the boys love it. No regrets at all and would highly recommend it. If you have doubts like I did, put them away and go for it..."
5,Great way to learn!!!,"This is a great chess set to learn with; I bought it for my son for us 5th birthday, he had been begging us to teach him chess. Within 3 evenings of playing he is comfortable with how each piece can move and has learned some basic rules. I bought this along with the book Chess for Kids which also provides scenerios and exercises to learn strategy. I have been amazed at how quickly he has picked up the game.I think the manufacturer indicated a 7 year old and up age on this because it helps is at least one player can read the cards."
5,Pure genius!,"WE LOVE this game. I bought this because as I was watching my 6 year old play checkers one day with his hand on his chin (much like the statue of ""The Thinker"") planning his next move so as to make the right choice I thougt, ""I bet he'd like chess, but I'M not going to be the one to teach him!"" Then at work my boss mentioned this game and I think it's brilliant. It teaches board set-up as well as the name of each piece by sight and which way each of those pieces can move (and which ways they can't). What it removes (until you are ready) is the strategy part. You can add that in at your OWN speed. It's great!"
5,Chess for preschoolers,"This is a great game to teach your young children some basics of chess, even if you have never played before! On each card, there's a picture of a chess piece, arrows showing how it can move, and a written description. You play by picking a card and moving that specific piece, if possible. If you pick a card for a piece that is ""trapped"" or cannot move, you just pick another card until you can move something. My 4 year old daughter can play it and win! Your kids start to learn the names of the pieces and the different ways they can, and cannot, move on the board. This is a great game for the whole family to start learning to play chess. It's been fun and educational."
5,Good game for kids.,"My six year old likes to play it. It is a good compromise for young children who want to play chess, but have not yet figured out all the rules."
4,My 3 year old can play this,My 6 year old and my 3 year old play this game with me all of the time. They love it. I didn't know how to play chess before - I've learned so much myself! We have a great time and I feel like my children are gaining a valuable skill.
2,Too basic,"This chess set is only good for kids/adults that have completely zero exposure to how chess pieces move. My 5yo daughter (who just started playing last month) knows how to do the basic chess moves, but she felt too restricted in terms of planning. For example, she wanted to move a piece that was going to get taken, but she could not because the chess cards did not allow her to. My husband and daughter hated it after one game. Oh well."
3,Okay,The children played with it for about an hour before the novelty wore off. Buy a regular chessboard. This item does not inspire an interest in learning chess. A nicer chessboard might intrigue a child to discover how the pieces move. This is one more junky toy we will donate to goodwill.
5,Chess-Mate!,"UPDATE: March 4, 2007When we bought the No Stress Chess for our seven year old grandson as a Christmas gift it was because his older sister was complaining that she needed someone to play chess with. Since she and her brother enjoyed playing other games together, the 'No Stress Chess' game seemed the ideal way to satisfy two grandchildren with one gift! Our granddaughter would have a chess partner and our grandson would be able to understand and play chess without being frustrated. I read the reviews, selected this one and hoped for the best. It was a great choice!I can't believe how much our grandson, age 7, and his sister, age 5 have learned about chess by playing this game! I am impressed. I rate the No Stress Chess an amazing success! CheckMate! ~ The Boss"
3,"Good entry point, but...","I just received this as a gift for my 5y.o. son. It seems like a good guide for teaching the basic moves of the pieces and for setting the board up. My son quickly memorized the order for the pieces on the board and has quickly caught on to how they move. For one that tends to not like to sit still I enjoy being urged to play a game. So this game has captured his imagination, or should I say it has placed it in check-mate? However, the game does fall short on teaching some of the finer points -- castling, en passant. The game also encourages too aggressive play with the king. It takes what is a game of skill and converts it into a game of luck."
5,We're gettin it!,"When my husband expressed interest in learning how to play chess and asked if I would want to learn, I decided to find something that would help us learn together. Different friends have talked about books but this game is perfect. The 2 sided game board provides the opportunity to learn and then flip over for the 'real thing'. The cards help you learn the moves for each piece clearly and simply. The game has 3 levels of learning play and then allows you to play a standard chess game. We're on level 2 right now and we're really enjoying learning the moves and strategy in an easy, fun, and hands on way. I can't imagine using a book, this makes the learning fun! I would highly recommend it for young and old who finally want to learn this classic game."
2,no easy way to learn chess,"I have two young boys - ages 6 and 8. They were learning to play chess so I purchased a few products and books designed for teaching chess to young children. Ultimately, this game is a poor quality chess set and nothing more. There is no ""easy"" way to learn chess. My boys were initially taught to play by joining a chess club at school. I wanted products for follow up teaching at home. I much preferred the other game I purchased.....Once A Pawn A Time. It was great quality and came with very funny instructional books that were more in depth. I would go with that game instead. Good luck! It's not easy for kids to learn chess, but it's very satisfying for them when they finally learn and master the game."
3,Fair value,The board is small and so are the pieces. I almost feel that I wasted my money. Look for something else.
1,A deceptive style of selfrighteousness,"A way of thought that of and by itself has a logical and unique flow. However it is a dangerous perception to have faith in because I as once a believer in such ""understanding"" lead a very self serving, self-righteous approach to others and the love toward others as commanded by CHRIST himself!"
1,Wacko History,"If you want to be taught a warped view of history and hear that white Anglo-Saxons are better than anyone else, read this book. Presents the quasi-historical view that the Anglo-Saxons are decendants of the 'Lost Tribes of Israel'. Mere historical fact, which violently disagrees with Mr.Armstrong, does not dissuade him from presenting this foolish theory."
1,United States and British Commonwealth in Prophecy......TRIPE,"Such utter nonsense. Amerika is babylon and the US and Britain, et al are descendent from Esau/Edom. The true Lost Ten Tribes are the so called native Americans and latinos of Indian descent."
1,United States and Britain in Prophecy!,You know I read this book years ago even owned one and always wondered why the events that were supposed to happen it the next few years didn't? Maybe because it's not going to happen. I will say it's a nice book for bigots.
1,British Israelism is dead. Thanks God,"Here in Brazil, I tried to read this trash-book online. I didn't read all of it. This book is divided into five parts:Part 1: Introduction.Part 2: Promises to the Patriarchs.Part 3: A Brief History.Part 4: Evidence From the Prophets.Part 5: New Testament and Conclusion.Writen decades ago, this book is a late time work about the Anglo-Israelism, a popular believe among many Protestant and Jewish circles in England and USA, during the period between 1870 and 1940.British Empire and Science doomed the British-Israelism between 1945 and 1945. British-Israelism and its followers are a small and useless cults today.This book tries to support this useless believe, without no sucess;at least in my opinion."
1,What a disappointment,"...This book was very misleading. After reading his book, it would lead me to believe that there is no such thing as free money or help. The book should have had more sources for free money (not loans). I know how to get a loan. His book referenced very few grant places (if any). It spoke on different places for assistance in various areas (e.g. someone who could help you start your own business such as SBA). Thats not the reason for my purchase. His commercial claimed that it could help you get free financial assistant for women entrepreneurship. It was a waste of my time and money. His book was misleading and a joke. Never will I purchase another one of his books."
1,Totally Useless Book...,I found this book to be totally useless. I had hoped to find resources for women starting a new business. No such luck. I also bought another book by Lesko at the same time -- it was also a waste of money in my opinion.
1,Not much substance!,"I found this book completely useless except for a paperweight or doorstop! What I did find interesting is that Vickie Adkins-Marcum seems to review all of Matthew Lesko's books. Of course Vickie highly exalts him using such phrases as ""KUDOS to Matthew Lesko! He's making this a better place!"" For those of you who are a little slow, let me inform you that Vickie Adkins-Marcum is really Matthew Lesko, or someone Matthew gave this review to and paid Vickie to post it. It's strange that Vickie's reviews all start out with the same first paragraph and have many of the same phrases throughout. It is also strange that Vickie only reviews Matthew's books. Shame on you Matthew Lesko for writing your own review!"
4,Free Money and Help for Women Entrepreneurs,"Matthew Lesko hits the bullseye again. This book contains valuable information for women wanting to start their own business. The information covers the financial and personal needs of women in all age groups, ethnicity and social standing. Any female wanting entrepreneurial assistance will find leads in this book. Not only does he talk about grants and loans to get the business started but he also gives information on training grants, free printed material on how to start and run a business, information on tax breaks/credits and more. This book includes resources that will help any female start a business and keep it running successfully. I found it very useful and have turned to it many times. Many avenues and doors have been opened as a result of this book."
1,Save the money you have!,"This book is totally useless. I've contacted several places listed in the book to no avail. This will NOT help you make money and does not lead to any ""free"" money anywhere. Keep the money you have!"
1,Not Worth It.,Don't waste your money on this. Book is just an outline of possible available avenues for securing capital - but absolutely nothing applied to my situation. It's been sitting on my bookshelf collecting dust.
5,Free money and Help for Women Enrepreneurs,"It is a wealth information and guide where to find the agencies, the services that they provide, INCLUDING PHONE NUMBERS AND WHERE TO LOCATE THIS OFFICES IN THE COUNTIES in the State in question. I have recommended this book to other people,specially single moms with children who are trying to start small busines, in order to give their children education beyong HS!"
2,slow shipping,"The book is alright I was hoping it would have more info that pertained to me, but the shipping took forever and I was a bit annoyed with that."
5,"Execllent reference, even for non-statisticians","I am not a statistician, but this book has been my major reference on matrix algebra since I got it. The presentation is a bit dense, but I want to point out that the author actually presents the proofs to essentially _all_ theorems in the book. Perhaps this explains the style. As for the content, I find this book very comprehensive in my experience. But the dense page-setting of the book actually makes it visually challenging to locate a result. I also note that there are extensive exercises at the end of every chapter, although I probably won't use this as a textbook for my students."
4,Great Reference but not Suitable for Learning,"The book is very dense and detailed, which makes it an excellent reference book. However, I don't believe this book is suitable for learning Matrix Algebra. Each chapter includes only a few practice problems which I found to be a major shortcoming. I still gave it a 4/5 because it will still be very helpful for me as a reference."
4,Great reference,This book is a must to have in your shelf if you deal more than once with matrices. Do not expect to learn from it as from a textbook but it is great as a reference - easy to find any missing bit of knowledge one might miss. All the properties with necessary proofs are there.Strongly recommended for everybody doing research in statistical learning.
1,"Sounds like a ""Cover Band"" remaking the original hits","Yes, I was disappointed with the lead singer of this CD. Didn't sound anything like the original ARS band. More like a lounge ""cover band"". Don't bother if you are a true Atlanta Rhythm Section fan."
1,This is not the Real Thing,"Prior to getting my car broken into, I owned the ARS greatest hit album ""Milennium"" This was of excellent fidelity and quality. I tried to get a less expensive replacement. What I got instead was a lounge act,""scratchy"" piece of garbage. I couldn't return it quick enough. I went back and bought Milennium and once again, am enjoying classic ARS. Don't go cheap on this one..you'll regret it!"
2,Not original recordings,"This compilation is a re-recording of their hits recorded in 1995.Sounds good, but I wish I would of known. It is the band, differentrecordings."
1,What the ................?,"I bought this cd cheap and thought I got a great deal. But then I listened to it and there's no way that Ronnie Hammond is singing lead vocals on this cd. And that's not the rest of the band backing him up. The lead singer definitely has a Southern accent but he can't match the sound of Hammond. It's bad! Really, really bad. I went on Atlanta Rhythm Section's website and looked at all their albums and never did find this one listed. This cd is made in Canada, has the number SLD23432 on it, and is more than half red and the other less than half silver. Looks like the studio might be Retro Music. I advise anyone considering buying this cd not to. If you like the boys from Doraville, you're probably going to hate the butchery that's been done to their sound."
3,These are not the original recordings I was expecting.,"I expected to hear the original recordings, and what I got was old guys trying to prove they could still play. Well, that's nice, but this re-recording (done in '95) definitely does not have the magic that the original recordings had. Ya, the guys are playing and singing in tune, but it's really obvious (to me, anyway) that something is missing. In particular on Spooky, they left out those haunting background harmonies which gave the song it's whole feel, and I can't put my finger on it, but I know that there's lots of other 'stuff' left out too, like guitar riffs, or some percussion, or something. This band was fabulous in it's day, but if you want to hear that great original sound, you won't find it on this CD. (Sorry guys)."
1,JUNK!,"Junk! Don't buy. These are all re-recordings. Another note: I bought this because I was looking for the song ""Spooky"". What I didn't know is that the original, which is what I was looking for, is done by a group called Classics IV."
1,Recorded Too Late,"This CD was recorded in 1993 - about 15 years too late. While the instrumentals are fine, the vocals are over the hill. Thought this was a collection of the original recordings like most other ""The Best of..."" CD's. I learned that Amazon will not accept CD returns once the plastic wrapping is removed, only after I listen to the CD."
1,These Are Not The Original Tracks,"This CD is worth avoiding. None of the tracks is the original. All tracks are re-recorded in 1995 by some lame assembly of musicians purporting to be ARS. If you want the original ARS cuts, avoid this CD at all costs."
1,Beware! Do NOT buy this [album]!,"Heck, I know it's only [price], but I was hustled.Don't buy this [stuff]... all the songs are re-RECORDED, not re-mastered. They sound nothing like the originals and it [stinks].I can hear it in the background right now, and I guess it is kind of funny. It's so bad, it's funny... ""worst CD ever""."
3,not the Real Atlanta Rhythm Section,"My best advice to you is _don't_ buy this cd. It was recorded in 1995, mostly past when ARS had their major hits. To say this cd is a disappointment is to put it mildly. Don't waste your money on this one!"
1,Typical dollar bin garbage,"I just wanted to do a quick review to warn people about this horrible movie that was made without anyone knowing about it. I knew it was going to be bad when I read on the back of the DVD case- ""with K.C. Armstrong and Jim Florentine from The Howard Stern Show and Crank Yankers"". The script is as bad as it gets, the acting is ok, and there is literally nothing good about the fights. The main problem is that the lead actor (some Korean guy) is very short, and his kicks don't look that powerful, and he can't kick high. The only reason I got this movie is because Bobby Samuels is listed as action director on the back of the DVD. He gets a fight scene, and after that I gave up. I couldn't take it and I turned it off about halfway through. Truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen."
1,Almost a Zero...,"I would not give this film a zero for 3 reasons.A: I thought some of the camera work; that is some of the visuals worked quite well in evoking some response. andB: I happen to know that this movie was actally filmed over 10 years ago in NYC despite the 2007 DVD release date.C: The Star, Director, Producer and some of the crew were all from Korea.Not that that makes up for the poor quality but it may help to explain why they possibly had a hard time in transitioning the film into an American vision."
1,Just so horrible,"I wish I could give this movie 0 stars because the acting,story and action was terrible."
4,"""Good Read""",Enjoyed the read! Author put togeather a very interesting insight to the entertaiment business dealing with the unsung workers of the business.
4,Solid Doc,"Not an extremely thorough documentary of the making of all the Friday films, but a solid and very entertaining one none the less. Tom Savini has a lot of fun as the host and the insight that is contained, mixed with the humor and love shared for all the films provides a over-all fulfilling experience for the viewer."
4,"""Good Friday The 13th DVD!""","I've always liked the ""Friday the 13th"" films and gladto have this set that has everything you want toknow about the franchise featuring cast & crewinterviews, rare footage & more. I recommendthis good dvd for your collection."
4,his name was jason dvd review,"very interesting documentary for die hard fans!Excellent item, fast packed, shiped with all others, good deal! Thank you, see you soon for more shop!"
2,"Dumb, self-congratulatory doc with little of interest to say","The Bottom Line:His Name Was Jason offers the occasional interesting morsel of information for people interested about the films, but mainly consists of the interviewees talking about how great and underappreciated the series is; if you go in looking for behind the scenes information, as I did, you'll almost certainly be disappointed during the unending sequences of self-aggrandizing indulgence.2/4"
3,A Decent Documentary on the Legendary Jason Vorhees,"Being a lifelong Jason/Friday The 13th fan I was thrilled to pick up this set, but I have to say it was not as good as I hoped it would be. I expected more scenes from the movies and less still pictures. Anchor Bay did go all out to interview many of the films stars through the years but they just jumped thru the movies too fast. The documentary is only 90 minutes long, it could have easily been 3 hours long and it really should have. I definite must to own for the true horror fan (like me) but I would suggest a rental first before purchase, most people will only need to see this once.."
4,INTERESTING LOOK INTO THE FRIDAY THE 13TH SERIES!,"I'm a fan of Jason even if the films his films haven't really captured the potential of this iconic fiend. This 2 discs set gives some insight why some of the films weren't as good as they should have been along with some trivia tid bits and facts. The two disc set is loaded with documentaries, short films from fans and interviews with cast members include all the actors who have played Jason Voorhees.I enjoyed this set and for fans of the franchise this is a no brainer, but I wouldn't pay too much for it. I found this for $5.00!"
3,wait until only five bucks folks,"this was kind lame and really did not have all actors and actress they should for the films. Beside it was kinda lame and some of these fans needs to get life. It appears there some who think Jason is a anti hero ? WTF is wrong with these people. If all you is watch slasher films you need to go see doctor and realized killing is never cool. It would be cool, if they did dvd set on all big slasher film explaining how they did all these scens. Becuase of some jobs are amazing."
2,"didn't match amazon description, wrong manual in box","Amazons add for this unit said it heats and cools a room. Thats what I needed for some equipment stabalization in a lab. what was sent to me only cools. The manual that was in the box was for a WA-1220M; WA-1220H and WA-1220E. Not the WA-7500M. After reading the the enclosed translated manual for the wrong product I inferred that the M designation stands for ""mechanical"" control and does not heat but only cools.I don't have time to dig the box out of the dumpster and try to return this thing. total loss."
2,Expensive fan,"I have a man cave in my backyard that was once a low income housing unit, then a big shed when I remodeled it. This cave is 13 ft wide by around 28 ft long and is very well insulated and in the very cold winter months is easily heated with a 40 dollar space heater. I decided to buy this A/C because I have two windows that are not window AC accessable and this one was a little cheaper than others. The mounting kit works very well, I was very please with this. Long story short, this AC does not have the power to cool this room, the air that is blows does not even feel that cold. I wish I would have installed an A/C through my wall instead or spent a little more for a more powerfull unit. Would probably work ok for a small bedroom because it is not that loud as well."
2,Weak,"It blows slightly cooled air which even on high takes a bit to lower the room temp barely at all. Also, the water tray fills within a few hours of running if I don't have it going somewhere (which I now do), and I don't even live in all that humid of a climate. Water is not easily removed either, have to let it out the pipe.As has been said, if it is at all possible to use a window unit, do so. I have crank outs so it sadly wan't for me."
1,GARBAGE!,Do not even bother buying this if it ever goes back on sale again. what a piece of junk! Connected it plugged it in and nothing. Let it run for about 1hr and got a slight cool breeze at best.
1,Not the right product picture was on the web site,Poor advertisement.Need to explain properly when you advertised it.This was not the picture was on the web when I order it.It was a Fluke Telephone test set
1,im upset.,It wouldn't play past one minute! Kept buffering and stopping. Waste of a few dollars. Really wanted to watch this movie.. Smh.
5,Wonderful,Very pleased with this product for a number of reasons. My daughter loved it and spends countless hours using it.
3,hard to follow along,I enjoyed Ernesto's performance in this movie; but that's about it. The rest of the cast either overacted their roles or the story was so jumbled up I couldn't understand it at all. I don't think subtitles could've helped me understand this at all.
4,WARNING: IN SPANISH WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES!,This movie is in Spanish with English subtitles! This is not mentioned on the sale site; this is in fact the only way it comes. For the record this is ASIN: 0780624998 UPC: 794043471131. We thought the movie was very funny. A great movie to watch next; Love Potion #9.
2,Reference Book with some tutorials,"This books seems to me more like a Maya Reference Book than a How to Book. I did not like the style the book was written in. There would be tool introductions and details for while and than a tutorial later on. The Writing seemed very dis-jointed to me.The tutorials were often hard to follow along with and the models in the pictures were hard to duplicate because the pictures usually mediocre or didn't cover all the angles. The Tool descriptions fill a lot of the book and weren't great. Basically, If you don't know how to use the tool already than the defenitions aren't in depth enough to help much; if you do know the tools than there is no reason to read the tool info in the book so I have no idea what group this book is trying to cater too."
2,Crappy book,This was book had boring tutorials and confusing wording. I learned more thru CG talk or Highend 3d sites. not worth it.
2,SOG 2.0 Bowie not up to par,"I waited in anticipation for my legendary SOG knife to arrive after I had waited years to accually own one. I removed it from the package to find the knife only in a small cardboard sheath around the blade and nothing else.Every other knife I have ever ordered came much better packaged. The knife has a good edge and a good look but it has flaws, very small but yet there. It does not feel like quality as do my lesser priced Kabars, Case and Ontario knives do. The sheath is a joke, nothing but a couple of cheap weak rivets and poor stiching, the hole for the leg tie was not even punched all the way threw, I do not see it holding up well. It even feels cheap. My other knives have better leather and better, rougher construction and rivits in key positions. My rate for this knife on a 1-10 would be 5 and dissapointed. My rate on the value and price; it is comparable to a $20.00 flea market special, big let down. SOG has lost my admiration."
1,Captain Obvious,"This book states the obvious.....and maybe that is a good thing to be reminded of at times...but it is a short book with very simple concepts that, if you have good friends or belong to a decent church, you have heard before. I was disappointed in it."
5,Where is The Bear,Just as I expected. arrived as promised Great customer service. mu daughter was overwhelmed to receive this book for her baby that is due June 6th 2013. This was my daughters favorite book when she was a baby and I read it every day. She wanted this book to read to our little Ansley. Thanks for the prompt service.
2,Shaky at best,"This was a B movie and it did not let me down. The only thing shakier than the camera man was the plot.First, let me say that the idea of the movie was pretty good and original but the execution lacked a whole lot. The camera work was horrible with shakiness, times that it was out of focus, background music that comes and goes and does not seem to belong there. The acting was second rate. The story line jumped around. There was absolutely no character building. Overall, this movie was like a train wreck, you don't want to look but can't look away."
2,Low Budget Entertainment,"If you liked ""The Room,"" you'll love ""The Trinket,"" a fun little horror movie that's clearly low budget, but certainly not lacking in entertainment value. The music and dialogue may seem campy at times, but the filmmakers certainly created an array of disturbing images that keep the viewer interested in how the film fetale battle will play out.The film, however, could have probably been told as a short, as some of the shots and scenes did feel a bit long or unnecessary. The acting was at times a little lacking, and at other times it felt like the actors might be intentionally performing so poorly. Often times it felt like there was an overflow of character exposition, ironically juxtaposed with a complete lack of character development. This may be appropriate, however, since the story isn't one about character sympathy (there are very few you could empathize with in the film), but rather a cut-'em-up revenge tale of a scorned woman. Worth a watch!"
4,Similar,"I have recently ordered both the Widu and this brush, so I can directly compare them for me. The Widu brush is a bit softer on my scalp; the Bass is slightly sharper and feels stronger and a bit rougher. I prefer the Widu, but not by much and the price is a lot better for the Bass. Overall, I much prefer either of these brushes to regular plastic bristle brushes. I am a swimmer and these are a lot more gentle on my hair after swimming."
5,The BEST hairbrush I have owned,"I love this brush. I have never been one to spend much money on hairbrushes, but at age 48 I figured it is time. I based this decision strictly on reviews. I was willing to spend much more money to get a wooden bristle brush. This seemed like a good place to start. IT IS THE MOST WONDERFUL BRUSH AND MASSAGES YOUR SCALP. A simple pleasure and from what I have read, wooden bristles are so much better for you hair. The reviews are spot on. You will not be disappointed!"
4,Best brush I've had.,"Doesn't leave static in hair, doesn't pull hair out, and IT""S NOT PLASTIC!!! I would give it 5 stars, but the black part that holds the bristles on seems like rubber or plastic."
2,Wrips my hair,I thought I was getting a wood brush with wood thistles. While this brush has a nice wooden handle the thistles are some kind of plastic and they wrip my hair. I haven't used it again since purchasing it.
4,Sturdy and a good price,"A nice, sturdy brush that is easy on long hair. I also use one as a cat brush because it is stiff enough that they like it, but not pokey. Only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that the cat likes to chew the bristles and he eats through the base pretty quickly so I have to replace his every 6 months or so."
4,"Good brush, but doesn't prevent static.","This brush is nice on almost all accounts, however it doesn't really do what it was purchased for. The base the bristles sit on is plastic, so my hair still accumulates static electricity when I use it."
1,Faulty?,"Bought this custom fit cover, and only one side fit the car. The drivers side had the mirror pocket and the other side didn't. Not sure if this was intentional (doubtful) or a manufacturing defect, but the other side didn't fit the car. It was sized as though the pocket would be there, but no pocket, thus a very tight fit.Also, I'm not seeing the 3 layers. The inside is stiff material and all double-stiched seams are exposed and on the paint. I paid extra for a custom fit cover and was very dissapointed. Maybe this one was a reject that somehow got through - I have no way of knowing, but I'll never buy one of these again."
1,Useless,"This product is useless, and never worked, not even for one minute. Amazon has effectively zero customer service so I got stuck with it.I am not sure if any swim p 3 products actually work -- My advice would be to forget about music and join a masters squad if you really want to swim. WHatever you do, don't bother with this piece of garbage."
3,Wish I had a different one.,"I bought this product to be able to use in the rain and it is great for that. However, it has been difficult for me to learn how to use it. Also, the adapters that go in the ear quickly fell off, were lost & now the headphones are uncomfortable."
4,Not to bad of a game.,"This game is not bad, It asks you to be stealthy and not alert the guards while you are trying to complete your objective. This can be quite hard to do sense some of the levels have many guards on patrol."
2,Old world war style,"The game was pretty interesting at first although I would have preferred a modern day theme. I was expecting a strictly sniping game but quickly found out that there were levels in which the game resembled a scene out of true crime in which the object became just to shoot your way through a town involving little to ni sniping. Also hiding and blending into the terrain is a bit unrealistic with the provided 1998 style graphics. Overall, I would save my money."
3,Wish I had more,"It is a co-op game, but I just wasn't that into it. The cameras are hard to control and times and it can get boring."
5,Challenging and fun,"Took many hours to finally win this game, and with my sons help we were able to pull it off. Countless hours playing it, and very entertaining."
2,"Got what I paid for, I guess","I liked having this mirror and it was inexpensive, but it was also, cheap. The piece for mounting it broke off within a couple of months. And that's with minimal use. It was a disappointment."
2,Not easy to install,This was rather difficult to install on my boat. I also found out that it doesn't meet the requirements for acceptable mirrors in Texas by the US Coast Guard.
4,Budget,"If your on a budget, this is the perfect wheel for you. I got mine about 2 months back, and works perfect.I picked up alot of time after getting this wheel, and getting used it."
1,Only has 2 out of 4 advertised features,"Advertised Product Features (Actual Product Feature)-cotton (actually 35% cotton and 65% polyester)+Feature form-fitted eye, nose, and mouth openings as well as an elastic band to hold the mask in place without slipping (actually true)-The specially-designed openings help prevent glasses from fogging up (actually causes glasses to fog up quite a bit)+Available in Mossy Oak Break-Up Camo pattern (actually true)If this was advertised as a poly/cotton mossy oak break up half mask, then I would have given it a much better review. However, I think if a product is sold as cotton, then it should be made of cotton."
1,Eating and shopping,"There's your ""plot"" in a nutshell. I can buy the fact that there was no ""murder"" in the sense that no one actually died here. What I can't buy is the consumerism, etc. I grew to really dislike Shelley by the end. On the one hand she's frugal, and on the other she's a shop-a-holic. Which is it?"
3,Mystery lite,"Jane Jeffry and her friend Shelley decide to attend a writers' conference, since Jane has just finished her first novel and hopes to pick up some writing pointers and perhaps an agent or editor along the way. They become acquainted with one of their favorite authors, but also meet some less pleasant members of the writing fraternity. Among them are the chauvinistic critic Zac Zebra, and the obnoxiously aggressive Vernetta Strausmann who is pushing her self-published and poorly-written mystery. Also there is a woman who calls herself Ms. Mystery who listens in on people's conversations and then puts the gossip she gathers onto her website. When Zac is attacked and editor Sophie Smith becomes violently ill, Jane and Shelley's radar goes up and they begin to investigate. This book remarkably has no bloodshed or dead bodies, but the mysteries it does contain are not exactly riveting. Also this book lacks the laugh-out-loud humor which was so endearing in the earlier entries in the series."
2,Did I miss the mystery?,I love Jane Jeffry but am not sure what has happened to her as of late. The books seem to be written on auto pilot and most of the charm is gone. This one was just a little too cozy for me as there wasn't even a murder. I highly recommend the author's other Grace and Favor series over this one. To say I was disasppointed in this one would be an understatment.
1,Not up to Jill Churchill's usually charming standard.,"With a few exceptions, I agree heartily with everyone that has reviewed Bell, Book & Scandal. I was so shocked at the difference in writing style, lack of character development, and simple dialogue that I logged on to Jill Churchill's website to make sure she actually wrote this book. Well, she did, but you would never know in comparing it with her other books. Jill Churchill normally writes a well developed character-driven mystery with an emphasis on charm. How many authors could make suburban life and car pooling interesting? Don't bother with this one, but pick up Grime & Punishment or another of her earlier mysteries. I look forward to the old Jane."
3,Not as bad as everyone says!,"I agree, there turns out to be no real crime, but you don't know that throughout the book until the end. This was an easy read; I finished it in an afternoon. Granted, there was a lot of information about the publishing business, but it was mostly quite interesting. Jane and Shelley are their usual selves. I heard Jill Churchill loud and clear; no question she wrote this one. It just doesn't have a murder case for Mel to work on and Jane to solve. Next time, perhaps."
1,Was there a ghost writer here?,"Wow, was I disappointed with this one. I can't tell if Jill Churchill let someone else help write it, or if maybe she's got a new editor or something who missed a lot of the strange changes in style. Jane is suddenly a lot more blatant about her sexual relationship with Mel -- I just hated that! It really didn't seem like Jane. There is WAY too much shopping, and the detailed description of every feature Jane gets on her new Jeep looked like product placement to me! And the writing seemed so simple compared to what I'm used to seeing by Churchill. Her Grace & Favor mysteries, and the previous Jane Jeffry books are so good. I just don't know what happened here."
3,Who are you and what have you done to Jane Jeffry???,"I always eagerly look forward to each 'Jane Jeffry' mystery and this was no exception. I excitedly picked it up and begin reading and after only a few pages, I closed the book to look at the author's name again just to make sure it was written by Jill Churchill. I felt as if Ms.Churchill began the book on high speed and did not slow down until the last few chapters. It was almost as if she just wanted to get it over with instead of bringing the reader along at a normal pace. I finished the book without being fully satisfied. I will again look forward to the next 'Jane Jeffry' mystery in hopes that the REAL Jane will return with all her charm along with the spunky Shelly by her side."
2,BORING!,"I have read every one of the Jane Jeffrey books and loved every one of them so when I realized that there was a new one that I hadn't yet read, I was on it! I struggled to get through this one but kept going because I have never given up on a book. This was dull, dull, more dull. Sure hope her next one is better."
2,Did Ms. Churchill lose a bet?,"I always look forward to anything by this author, but this latest has been a major disappointment. What happened to the story? I usually have a difficult time putting Jill Churchill's books down, even for sleeping. For this one, it was a struggle just to finish. Whatever is happening in Ms. Churchill's life I fervently pray it gets resolved and she can resume her usual delightful fare."
1,I have to agree!,"I have to agree with the others that this is just not up to Jill's other Jane Jeffrey mysteries. No murder mystery, too much repetition, no tension, too drawn out and no satisfying conclusion. Since it was set at a Mystery Writer's Conference it appears that the author has missed the point of what makes a good mystery in this book! I have her newest Grace and Favor to read now and we will see how it fares!"
1,A ghostwritten book? Written quickly to fulfill a contract?,"I have enjoyed several of Jill Churchill's books, but this one is a true clinker in the midst. Everything seems so contrived and unrealistic. For example, one of the two main characters says something and her friend responds with, ""Heaven forbid!"" In another instance, the heroine calls home, after being away for a few days, to ask family members not to be doing any laundry when she gets home as she wants the washing machine free to wash her own clothes. One, who would think to call home to ask this after being gone only a couple of days? And two, what teenage daughter would be washing clothes anyway?"
2,Glaring error...,"I have enjoyed other Jane Jeffry books, but I had a hard time getting into this one. It was a bit of a slog and I just wasn't drawn into the story. At the end a literary error was so glaring that I just gave up on it: she refers to women dressed as grubby little boys along with a man dressed as Sherlock Holmes as Doyle's Bow Street Runners."" Doyle had his Baker Street Irregulars which are not related to the Bow Street Runners. Such an error about one of the classic mystery writers just made me sad. Maybe she wasn't much into the book either."
2,Very Disappointing,"This book is not as badly written as ""The Accidental Florist""--that's about all the praise I can give it. None of the characters are realistic, not even Jane, Shelley, and Mel, with the dialogue they have been given. There is no subtlety of language, no quirky self-thoughts. It's a real let-down."
4,I thought this was a great source,"I purchased this book as an added resource. Overall, I thought this was a great book, being a former Sunni Muslim there was a lot that I was able to relate to. In addition, many aspects of the religion that I was ignorant to, that were made clear such as History, and the bases of the fundamental beliefs. I enjoyed this book so much; I was able to read it in its entirety in a matter of days. The only aspects I did not really like, was the fact that at times, I felt that the Authors personal opinion, rather than a biblical perspective, was overly exerted. So anyone reading thins book needs to be well versed in the word of GOD, so that they do not get side tracked in feed into the opinions of man. Rather focus on the things of GOD; this is from where clarity comes."
3,Story of the Hour,"Kate Chopin's `Story of the Hour', was an interesting story. Not necessarily in a bad way at all. I mean you except it to go one way but it goes another. This story is about a woman, who discovers that her husband is dead, but she's neither upset nor devastated, she is excited.Mrs. Mallad is the only character the author really describes, as young woman with a fair calm face. She could be described as very emotional. Why is she so happy that her husband is dead?The story starts at Mrs. Mallad's house, she is in her room. An excellent theme for this story is `To be excited about something is not always a good thing.'The strength for this story is most definitely the plot. It keeps your attention and allows you to see a different view. A weakness is the description; really the story only describes one thing, Mrs.Mallad. I think that the story needs to tell us more about her past life and what happened during those couple of years.Overall this story was OKAY."
4,"""The story of an hour"" by Kate Chopin","""The story of an hour"" by Kate Chopin was a good short story. Not bad, but good. It's about a woman named Mrs. Mallad that learns that her husband is dead. She then thinks she is free until certain events ruin it. Mrs. Mallad is the main character and the only one the author describes. She is young with a fair, calm face. She is also very emotional!The story starts at Mrs. Mallad's house and in her room. A possible theme is to not get your hopes up. The strength in the story is the plot. It keeps you on your feet. For the weakness, I would have to say description. The story should've said what her past was like with her husband. Good or bad?Overall ""The story of an hour"" was good."
5,Bell balanced and entertaining,"This is vintage Lonely Planet. I show this every year to my World Geography students. You learn about the lingering difference between the north and south. Eastern cultures tend to drink and eat what we might term edgy foods and the like..you won't believe what Justin eats on this video, I should say what she drinks---major yuko! The seaside resort is spectacular, as long as you don't need electricity 24 hours a day. Her visit at a war memorial type place complete with tunnels used during the Vietnam war is fascinating. Her trek through Hanoi with it's 'trade identified street names' is intriguing. I love this video and highly recommend it."
4,Just okay,"For a normal CD, Wild Card would be great, but for a Penneywise CD it's their worst yet! Penneywise can and has done a lot better in their first and later CDs. I recommend this CD only for a hardcore Penneywise fan. If you're looking for something like Penneywise's better albums such as ""Straight Ahead"" or ""Land of the Free"" you won't find it with this CD which has more primative lyrics and an overall cruder, less put-together sound."
2,Pennywise's Only Bad CD,"pennywise is one of my favorite bands and i have all their cds and love like every song on all of them...except this one. The singer sounds so much different and it just sounds like snit. Get the self titled, from the ashes, or about time instead."
1,Bootleg,"Surprised Amazon.com lets people sell bootleg items. This is a bootleg cd. This is not APPLE CORPS LTD., nor Capital Records. This is a knock-off piece of trash. Certainly, the artists themselves get no royalties. You're givving your money to some bubba who makes these dvds in his basement, or orders them from Hong Kong, where International Copyright Laws are not respected."
1,Item never was delivered,"The product was purchased Dec. 2 with a promised delivery date between Dec. 9 and 24. As of the New Year it had not been delivered. I had received emails asking if I was pleased with the product. (Implying it had been delivered.)I spent about 20 minutes on Amazon trying to find a customer service phone number to take it up with someone. No luck. Finally I called Visa and cancelled the sale.I wonder if Amazon is merely a branding service for professional eBay hawkers, unemployed people who work out of their basements. This video was a Christmas present for my best friend. I was really disappointed with the lack of service and the difficulty finding a way to talk to someone.w.c."
1,Maybe it was pirated??,"After looking all over for a CD with Peter Schilling's ""Major Tom"" on it (since for some reason he's not allowing it to be sold as a single on Itunes, and I didn't want to pay for his whole album when I only cared about that song), I was excited to find a compilation CD that not only had that song on it, but a couple others I loved from ""back in the day"" that I wanted to include in a work-out mix. Unfortunately, the product that arrived had the most horrible sound quality imaginable in modern times, with some songs actually skipping and an obvious loss in depth and quality of sound at all levels. I found a uTube video of Major Tom that has better sound quality coming out of my lame computer speakers than this CD sounded coming out of my stereo and Ipod!As far as I'm concerned, I STILL don't have the product I wanted. I guess you get what you pay for, since the CD was really cheap.The vendor did send it quickly, but I wish he weren't selling such crap."
1,"Great story, bad quality","I'll give the book itself five stars, but the book I received is not the one shown in the picture above, and it's also in very bad shape. The cover is creased in a number of places and it's got a worn price tag stuck on the front, and it's also the wrong edition. The one pictured above matches my copies of Han Solo and the Lost Legacy and Han Solo at Stars' End, and that's the one I wanted. This one does not. If I weren't so against throwing books away this thing would be going in the garbage."
4,The Han Solo Adventures Continue,"This book picks up shortly after the events of ""Han Solo at Stars' End"" (Book one of this series). If you haven't already done so, read that book first. Brian Daley unfolds this story more in the style of a mystery. As Han and Chewbacca (along with their droid side kicks Bollux, Blue Max, and a few other new characters) seek to collect on a deal gone sour, their quest takes them to the backwater planet of Ammuud. Along the way we encounter sabotage and double-cross and plots within plots. The author drops clues and hints as to the identity of Hans' nemesis (and he does indeed have at least one). Compared to Han Solo at Stars' End, this book is a little less polished. But the author still manages to nicely convey the ""big screen flavor"" of this story and make it an enjoyable read."
4,song about Alzheimers,"This song is by Sara Westbrook, written for her mother, who was diagnosed with Alzheimers, so it has great heart! She has a very tender, beautiful voice, wish it was sung by someone older though."
4,Excellent overview of concepts on Operating System,"This book provides basic introduction to OS concepts with clear descriptions, complemented by good figures demonstrating the concepts being taught. In addition, it has a website that is rich with resources, providing a wealth of information whether to be used for teaching, presentations or further understanding.However, this book does not dwell in depth into any particular topic. Further research or other technical books need to be undertaken on any particular topic of interest or actual implementations (Linux, Unix, etc).Given my background in electrical/electronic engineering, this book serves me well to understand the basic concepts of OS design."
2,Not for beginners,"I am an undergraduate student in MIS, and I have to take a course in OS. This is the book the professor assigned.I began reading the first few pages today, all the while wondering just what kind of beginning OS student would find this useful. Stallings jumps in to a detailed description of hardware components without providing a simple, ""top-down"" description first. The prose is wordy and, at times, unneccessarily infused with technojargon. Sometimes the author makes such great leaps in his thinking that the reader is left puzzled, at best. I got the impression when I read these few pages that Stallings intended this book to be a follow-up to a basic introduction to computer hardware learned in another course.Bottom line: This book is probably very useful for those who have spent a good deal of time studying computers at the design level. If you're taking an OS course outside of a computer science degree program, you'll likely be confused"
4,Stallings OS 6th Edition,"This book provides not only an excellent overview of general operating systems principles, but it also describes modern operating systems such as Windows (in its many guises), UNIX and Linux in great detail.Another strength is the use of many excellent diagrams to illustrate the concepts dealt with in the book.I am using it as a reference for one of my courses."
1,Don't buy this book unless you must!,This book contains all you need to know about OS at a beginner level. It fails badly to deliver it in a simple and clear way.The examples are not detailed enough and hard to understand.There are lots of examples from outdated operating systems.The practical utility of this book is almost zero.You need to consult other documentation to solve the problems.Overall: it manages to complicate simple things and make you feel like an idiot.
2,Too many nonsense for introductory book,"this is the worst book that i have encounter in my life. i have been looking for a book as a supplimentary for my OS course, however this book failed to deliver to give understantable examples and teory. I agreed that this book have a lot to offer, packing with a lot of examples and illustration but none of them make me feel usefull. in other word, IT IS USELESS. What i want is a book that can give a simple way of teaching to the subject and not a book that trying to confuse the readers.finally, i strongly not recommend this book for those who are looking a simple and easy to understand OS reference book.this book make me feel stupid!"
3,Boring and useless,"This is a useless book. There is nothing useful in it. A lot of theory, but almost nothing about aplications. It was very difficult to read and very boring. The worst thing, is that I didn't learn something useful. The code examples are stupid! Honestly, I lose my money with this one."
1,taste awful,Disappointed !!It taste like sour cream with coco powderI luv MILKA products and chocolates BUT this stuff really taste bad !
1,Oops! Wine glasses don't fit!,"I now have a new pencil storage box as the picture of this product led me to believe a standard wine glass would fit in the slots. And the slots cannot be rearranged to make them fit. Besides, the box is so flimsy I probably wouldn't fill fully with glasses as I'm not sure it would hold them."
2,too small for glasses,"I bought this box to store extra wine glasses, but the dividers were too small. Took the dividers out and just kept it to store papers instead."
5,The perfect little moose book.,"Compact yet complete, less than 50 pages, but packed with fabulous photos and facts. Simple enough for the kids but with enough information for adults. Great buy."
5,excellent starter info,This is cute little book with good pictures for starting info about the moose. Nice read for younger children. It has color pictures to show the animal.
5,It's Good!,"I got involved in the story from the very beginning and really enjoyed reading it. Great escapism - different from any other romance novel I have read before. If you want something a little different, I recommend it. If you want all fluffy & nice then skip it."
2,"I was a big fan of Jane Feather, but...","this is far from a good book. The heroine goes through a lot of (unnecessary) torment, and any book that makes Marie Antoinette into a nice girl and a good friend of the heroine is going to be hard to swallow. This is more along the lines of an historical Danielle Steel, in which the heroine triumphs over adversity, after hundreds of pages of pain, through which you must wade. If you like descriptions of pain, suffering, violent sex, and a heroine who doesn't even try to be monogamous (even before meeting her husband) this is for you. But with the hundreds of books available in this day and age, don't waste your time"
2,It could have been a great book.,"I have never began a book and not finished it. So there for I wish I had never stared reading this one. I will give Ms.Feather her due it could have been a great book, but it fell so very short of what it could have been. All of the characters had the potential and so did the story but some where they just fell flat. I give it a three for the characters, but other than that, well I wish I never picked it up"
1,This one is disappointing...,"Although I have thoroughly enjoyed other books by Jane Feather, I didn't like this one. I should have put it down when I first had an inkling of distaste because it wasn't worth my time. I read romance novels for that -- romance. I do NOT read romance novels for violence, especially violence against women. If you want to sleep with bad dreams, go ahead & read this one in bed. Otherwise, I recommend leaving it on the shelf."
2,The one Jane Feather DON'T READ!,"If I want to read gory or disturbing mystery novels, I'll turn to another genre. A heroine overcoming adversity is one thing, but following the heroine through her horrific marriage was not the slightest bit enjoyable. Romance novels should not be about this kind of adversity."
2,Much too violent for romance!,"The story has an enticing plot summary, but thestory fails to live up to its promise. Instead, thereader is subjected to a tale of misery, woe, andviolence so depressing you find yourself wonderingwhy you picked up (and finished!) the book in thefirst place. There is no attention given to makingthe main characters either believable or interestingand the reader finds herself stretching to the pointof breaking to be able to sympathize with them at all.A very disappointing read."
4,How Should We Then Live?,"If you really want and a deeper understanding of what true believers must do - this is the book for you.The process of how we have moved so far out of the christian ways (according to the scripture), is sad.The true believer will enter and find the things lost with this world, that we refocus our lives, to startshare the principles by which we are to live."
1,Introduction was the best part of the book,This book was recommended from one serious Christian to another. I think the author was well outside his area of expertise (look up his degrees online) and it shows in the book. I would leave this one at the library.
1,Unbelievable incompetence and discredit,"Reading such a book containing that many historical and philosophical mistakes is appalling. And seeing that all these Christian reviewers give such high marks to such a compilation of mistakes says much about their poor discernment capacities. And these guys want us to believe they have the truth? I admit that some Christian authors produce academic or otherwise serious books, but what should I think when I see that Christian readers cannot discern (among their own books) the good ones from the awful piece of drivel such as this present book? I agree with the reviewer below (name: Klebanoff, Dec. 1998; whom I understand is an atheist like me): this book is worthless, save your money. Read instead Drange's nonbelief. And I will not recommend the books by better, serious Christian thinkers, that's their problem, they have to know themselves their more acceptable, serious books."
2,If only reality were so simple...,"I was drawn to Francis Schaeffer because of his reputation as a ""scholarly"" apologist, and I came away from this book impressed with the scope of his knowledge. Unfortunately, Mr. Schaeffer's considerable erudition is misused, and the book is essentially a series of bald assertions, questionable generalizations, and gross oversimplifications. (His caricature of Aldous Huxley borders on the slanderous.) Mr. Shaeffer is not analyzing history; he is filtering it to find support for his predetermined conclusions. Sympathetic readers might find his arguments compelling; I found them appallingly specious."
5,What the world needs to see and hear.,"Francis Schaeffer has taken and given a complete synopsis of history, philosophy, theology and art and has shown the progression of humanist thought in every culture through out history. This book, written in the 70's, makes predictions of where our culture was headed at the time and 23 years later he is correct in those predicitions. From his predictions that euthanasia would become an ethical problem of the future like abortion at the time of the writing of the book. This book is clear and concise and shows the direction our culture is headed at present time."
3,"great book, poor delivery","I read this book some years ago. It is Fantastic. I ordered this copy as a gift to a dear friend. As it did no arrive in time at my hotel, all was lost. I know it was my risk, but 10 days to deliver a book is poor service."
4,Great little sub,I picked this sub up due to money restraints and because I have large fronts so I wasn't in need of much power from a sub. The sub puts out great sound in a rather large open room. For the price and size I really enjoy this sub.
1,book is not what is pictured,"Beware.....they are sending the animal theme book, which is not the book pictured for this item. The pictured book is much thicker. So disappointed to receive this tiny book. When I read reviews just now, it appears this has happened to others too."
3,Problem solving,This book is just a small fraction of the original book that covered more than one grade level. That was disappointing. Great problems for teaching strategies to solve mental math.
2,"I'm fond of Saberhagen, but what a mess!","The editor needs a good talking to. While this book has a number of suspenseful moments, and I don't feel completely cheated, I think Fred needed to do another draft of his outline. Tension is built up on elements that prove to be completely irrelevant, like the mysterious box of contraband. Turns out, it's just a device to get the main character into the book. The McGuffin of the title, Shiva, inexplicably fizzles toward the end, and a whole new Big Ending Battle ensues that is totally unrelated to Shiva's fate. Hints are raised (Berserker's being ""lucky"" for the sociopath) that end up nowhere. I love the Berserkers, but this one was a disappointing mess. I wish other writers would write Berserker books."
2,Rather Disappointing,"First, let me say that in general I like the way Fred Saberhagen writes, and his stories and plots are exceptional. I got hooked on the berserker series after reading ""Berserker Base"", and went to my local half price bookstore and bought every book in the series I could find. This book, Shiva in Steel, has proved to be the worst. The hype over the big bad Shiva is never resolved! Did it die? Is it hiding in our hero's ship as he makes his get away? We never know. Mr. Saberhagen repeats himself a lot, and his prose isn't very smooth in this novel for some odd reason. He's done fine in the past, but this one was sloppy. New editor? No editor? The plot wasn't bad, but the execution was poor. This should have been a draft rather than the final product. If this is your first Berserker book, don't give up on the series. This was the worst of the bunch; the others are pretty good."
2,weak...,"This is really quite weak compared to Saberhagen's earlier writings. Not terribly engrossing. if you're new to the Berserker series, start with a much earlier book. Only read this if you liked the Berserker series as a whole and are willing to spend time on the weakest member of the series."
2,What is going on?,"Not only is it hard to follow, but I truly have no idea if they got Shiva or not! I happen to be a great fan and have all the books and stories, but I have to say, Mr. Saberhagen may wish to pass on the series to another writer."
2,Wish the Berserker's had one this one.,"I've been a fan of the Berserker books for more than 20 years: To the point that I've been known to rebuy a Berserker novel at the airport because there's nothing new I'd rather pick up. So two stars is pretty much the lowest rating I'd give a Berserker book on principal. My two biggest objections to this book are:1) The characters all have hidden agendas that are never exposed. Mr. Saberhagen refers to connections between the characters, but never fleshes them out. By the time the Berserker's arrive on the planet I was praying they would destroy humanity just so I wouldn't have to spend any more time with the characters.2) Mr. Saberhagen tends to repeat himself in the book. Many times Mr. Saberhagen says the same thing within the same paragraph or two. I really wish he'd spent more time adding detail to the characters."
5,BEST PHONE OF ALL TIME,"Granted, it's out of date...but for it's time, it was the best phone I have ever purchased (and I usually purchase a phone about once a year.) It's 100% the most durable phone I've had. It's been dropped in water, broken to pieces several times, and fell off of the top of a moving car in the middle of the street & still worked with no problems whatsoever. Nothing ever moved slowly for me on it. Everything that this phone offers works on it. If Sony Ericsson were to make a 4G LTE phone today with the same quality, of this - I would never puchase a phone again! Well, that is, until they came out with 5G, of course."
2,Poor writing,"Prentice Hall's other books (Core Java, Just Java, etc.) were so good that I didn't bother to carefully look at Multithreaded Programming with Java Technology before buying it. I wish I had looked closer! This book is poorly written, poorly edited, poorly organized, and is only partially about Java threads. It appears to be a port from the authors' previous book on pthreads, and takes up too much space covering details of the underlying hardware without adequately covering Java itself.Many of the examples show C code, and their coverage of Java almost seems like an afterthought. If you're interested in Java threading and are in the market for a good book, I suggest that you keep looking. For an example of the poor style of writing, look at chapter 4's section on The Runnable Interface."
2,Disorganized Mess,"I purchased this book hoping to develop a deeper understanding of multi-threading, the proverbial under-the-hood down and roll-your-sleeves-up nitty gritty. Frankly this book left me quite disappointed. It's poorly organized and poorly editted. While I am sure it has some valuable content, the low readability level and very poor organization (it really gives the impression that it was sort of patched together) prevented me from ever getting into it. In my humble opinion, the book""Taming Java Threads"" by Allen Holub is a fare better choice if you want to master Java threads."
5,Just what the Dr. ordered!,"Amazon has a very well stocked section of Jungian books! Active Imagination is often a stumbling block for people. ""How do i know I'm not just talking to the part of me I already know? "" ""This is a little scary.""This is a good book, to begin to understand the critical place Active Imagination plays in Jungian Analysis or Psychotherapy. Yes,it's dense, yes you have to chew on small pieces b/c it is Jung's writing/presentations, et al put together by Joan Chodorow, PhD, an Analyst and Dance Therapist."
3,More than expected,This product has its pros and cons like any game. Although the pros seemed to outway the cons.however do not unless you are not a namco fan.do not unless you are not a namco fan.Pros:entertainingfast pacedLasting quality (since there is no campaign it lasts as long as you want it to)large selection of traditional arcade gamesCons:the assortments are quickly finishedsome of the games become repetitive quicklycostThis product may have its pros and cons like any game.Overall this a great product and one I highly recommend
2,Huge disappointment,"Im 41 and have great memories of playing arcade games in actual arcades during my youth. This PSP package includes several of those games -- and my memories are much rosier than the actual games. I dont know if it is the PSP platform (and the terrible joystick ""nub"") or the games themselves but I got about 30 minutes of distraction from this game before putting it aside forever. Worst ROI from a game yet. If you are looking for a PSP game, spend your money on Patapon2 or PuzzleQuest."
2,Not so Great..,"Was disappointed that game had only 3 retro games I really liked; Pac-man, Ms. Pac-man and Galaxian.Namco could have put more interesting games on the Collection"
5,Wonderful classic mets new school twist!!!,"This game is awesome! Sony has done a great job with combining the old with the new. Not only do you receive the old school acrade games... Sony includes a ""remake"" of each game as well. Which quite frankly.. I perfer!! If you are a true Pac-Man fan.. get ready for the super graphics!! I purchased my PSP on Amazon for $229.00 & this game for $39.99 - Great way to consolidate entertainment. Be Blessed!"
5,great game just good old school fun,my 13 year old plays it all the time. i have also played it because its the ones i played when i was young.
5,Namco Museum Battle Collection Game,This item was purchased to go with my daughters PSP 3000 and I have found myself using it more than her...not by her choice! This is a must have for anyone who loves old school arcade games...
4,Moisture meter,Purchased this item to use when building cabinets for our home. It works well and provided me with necessary information to know if the wood I was using was at the proper moisture content.
4,Great Results,"I bought this to have an all-in-one that, with a more aggressive pad, would give me a little more correction than most AIO products.I get a very smooth, glossy finish with this product, along with a coat of sealant protection. It will remove very light swirl marks and fine scratches---you will need a more aggressive polish to do more.It took me awhile to find a good speed with my RO polisher---actually went with faster speeds than I'd ordinarily use with finishing products. I thought that the product dried a little faster than I expected. It was easy to remove, however, even when I applied it too thickly.I top this with Collinite 845 insulator wax. This combination is excellent---I suspect you could top Polish with Sealant with other wax finishes for extra protection.Overall...very good product that can save a step or two."
1,bad re-recordings,"These aren't the original recordings. It sounds like they tracked down the original artists to re-do them, but their voices are really bad. Too bad - I really looked forward to this album."
3,The early part of the 1970s,"This is a rather skimpy collection, as the decade of the 1970s gave us plenty more than just 10 million sellers. It is interesting though, for the variety of styles represented here: rock by Rare Earth, Badfinger and Paul Revere and The Raiders, catchy pop by Edison Lighthouse, Paper Lace and Sweet, impressive vocal pop by Hamilton, Frank and Reynolds and sweet rapping soul by The Chi-Lites. The track weighting leans more towards the early part of the decade, as Love Grows Where My Rosemary Goes, Don't Pull Your Love, Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling, Indian Reservation and Have You Seen Her all hit the charts in either 1970 or 1971, whilst the contributions of Sweet and Paper Lace come from the middle of the decade. These songs are all great but there are many more comprehensive 1970s collections available."
4,Great Intro to Celtic Spirituality!,"Every Earthly Blessing opens a window to the Celtic spiritual tradition, using stories, poems, and songs to breathe life into our vision of their culture. It is not an accurate history, but it captures the essence of the Celtic christian worldview and spiritual practices. The author takes us on a journey through the prayers of farm women, the monastic ascetic practices, and the meaning and theology behind their symbols(such as the celtic cross).I was inspired by the lives of the monks, spent in isolation or on long journeys, seeking to be completely reliant on God. Their life-encompassing understanding of God, one who provides the rain, everyday food, plants to heal, is so different from the limitations I sometimes put on God. There is much less separation for them between everyday survival and spiritual life.There are many little treasures in this book, insights that will open up another understanding of the world, and perhaps add depth to your spirituality."
2,Good Enough,"I read this book because I love Jane Yolen - Dragon's Blood, Heart's Blood, Tartan Magic - and I have to say that I was disapointed! I found a dry plot, none too interesting, and - in my opinion - useless footnotes clogging the content, and I was very turned off.Listen, you can read this book if you want, but I would suggest no.If you want good Jane Yolen, read Pit Dragons or Tartan Magic and leave this book on the shelf."
2,"Interesting topic, Not so great writting","The topic of this book is interesting, but the writing skill is poor. The book really did not hold my attention. It jumped around alot and basically told about one man after another without drawing the reader into the story. To tell you the truth one of her ""dates"" was pretty much like the next and the next and the next, so I got bored very quickly. Like reading a grocery list not a well written novel."
2,Disappointing,"While I have yet to take the LSAT, and am therefore not sure about the quality of the questions, there are some major problems with this book. First, the answer keys are sometimes wrong. Second, editing is poor, with misspelled words, etc. Third, and most irritating, the CD is worthless, and is actually just an audio CD of the exact text of the book. It has NO sample tests and is NOT a program. You have to spend another $20.00 to upgrade it to do so, although the link provided to do this doesn't work either. So if you wanted to take sample tests on your PC and get your likely score, DO NOT get this book. No wonder its one of the cheapest ones."
4,A little darker than the other ones my son has read,"My 9 year old son loves these books and reads them over and over. But this one got a ""not my favorite"" from him. He still reads and likes it, but he said it is darker and scarier than the other ones. I think if he were 7 or a young 8 it might have bothered him more."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,It says that they are the original artists. Could have fooled me. These must be the versions that were discarded for the final versions. Don't waste your money.
1,How Disappointing!,"I've been burned again by a compilation collection! Had I been able to read the teeny tiny fine print on the back of the CD before I purchased, I could have seen that this was a collection of RE-RECORDED hits from the original artists and I would not have wasted my money. The sound quality is poor and inconsistent on nearly every track."
3,Not a good start for this beginner.,"I wanted to start making my own books, so I bought this one to help me. I had a few problems. Some of the steps in the starch paste recipe are unclear, so the first time I tried I got starch soup instead. And in the hard cover multi-signature instructions, the steps get very contradictory. They tell you to past the hinge onto the spine directly, then later you're told to paste down the sewing tape BEFORE the hinge.. which would be impossible if you had followed instructions up to that point, because the tape is sewn into the signatures right at the spine.I've managed to muddle through, but I still would not recommend this book to people just starting out in bookbinding."
4,"A good, solid read.","Wing Commander, Heart of the Tiger was quite a good game.Wing Commander the book was also well writen, considering it had to 'compete' against the Computer Game.Forstchen and Keith make a good interpretation of the game, and put it into good prose form. The story had substance, the protangonists didn't always win, and character developement was well planned.However, truthfully, no novelisation of a Computer Game can ever be sucessful. Whereas Computer Games have more than one 'path' to the eventual end of the story, a novel can only have one 'path', leading to one ending.But, regardless of that small fact, the book was a good read, not a must read, but one that you should consider, if you have the money/time."
1,Just terrible.,"This thing is just plain bad. Good concept that had no budget, Silverman was terrible, it was just all wrong. Bought this and five days to something or other on the same order. The other one was much, much, much better."
4,Memorable,"I saw this movie when it aired on Fox -- once -- 13 years ago. And I always remembered it.I'm not a fan of scifi (despite all the Quantum Leap on my shelf), I hate time travel. But this movie -- I loved how the main character started off as a loser and just kept getting better every time the day repeated.There aren't really a lot of movies I saw once and remembered forever. The last time I went looking for info on it, I saw it was out on DVD and actually bought it. I think it's the only movie I've ever bought that didn't have Scott Bakula in it. (I lie -- I also bought Crazy People. very funny and also a great love story).Years after this, I tried watching Groundhog Day, but it bored me and I never finished it. This movie is heartwarming."
2,The original 12:01,"This film was just OK in my opinion. I strongly urge you to see the original 12:01. first filmed as a short in 1990, starring Kurtwood Smith who is perhaps best known for playing Clarence J. Boddicker in Robocop. This version focuses on the tragic aspect of the idea, with Smith's character (trapped in one hour! - not 1 day!) becoming more frustrated with the situation as the story goes on. The most heartbreaking moment is when he has explained to another character what is happening (and proven it by predicting a few occurrences around them). She responds by trying to give him comfort with an embrace. Both versions are based on a story by Richard Lupoff. The 1990 short was nominated for an Oscar."
2,12:01,"I've heard people say that this movie is better than Groundhog Day but I don't agree. The quality of movie isn't as good and neither is the acting. The only thing I could say was better was that they gave a reason for the day to be repeating and a way to stop it. For the first ten or fifteen minutes I was sitting there thinking ""This is pretty dodgy"" but it did get better."
5,Wonderful!,"I played this for a large group of my friends at a sci-fi evening. I was worried they'd chat through it, or heckle it to death. I was amazed with their response! I've never seen them so attentive, so gripped and entertained.The main character, Barry Thomas, is such a quirky funny guy that he provides a sort of narrative to the story. His jokes and comments with and to the other characters are excellently timed and played out. The casting is brilliant. Minor characters perfectly play their parts without seeking too much limelight, meanwhile adding to the humour. The film would be nothing without the quiet talent that is content to slip from shot and return the focus to the two main characters. This is a romantic comedy, science-fiction, fantasy, action, thriller, crime film. It has a gentle feeling that sometimes surprises you with believable stunts and a dark ending."
3,A funny sci-fi movie. Worth seeing.,"A science experiment gone bad causes the world to keep repeating the same day starting at 12:01 am. The unlikely hero is the only one who realizes the day keeps repeating itself. Story revolves around his efforts to fix things. Has comedy, romance, and adventure. Everyone I know who has seen this movie liked it. I'd buy the video if it were available. The only place I've seen it is in some video store chains."
5,"One to watch, time and again","Having watched 12:01 several times I have always found it a very enjoyable movie. Martin Landau and Helen Slater being cast helped it along as well. There's comedy, suspense, and a little non thinking mans scifi which makes for an excellent movie."
5,Most Entertaining.,"This time-loop based story has a well integrated measure of light-comedy. This makes the customary loop-repetition parts pleasant and interesting. The story keeps pace, and never turns dull. It is amazing how fast the time passes! It is a keeper based on it's entertainment value."
4,Good Story With Likeable Characters,"I saw this on TV when it came out and was glad to see it on DVD. Nothing spectacular, but a good story with likeable characters in it. No really great acting, but again, just a good thing to watch and feel good about after."
4,Waited also to find it,When I saw this movie a long time ago I really liked it. Its no great film but quirky and I love time travel motifs. I enjoyed greatly the chemistry of the two stars and the nerd gets star girl plot. Jeremy Piven has a small role. Not as good as Groundhog Day but always a favorite of mine. I looked for it for a long time and couldn't find it. What a delightful surprise to see it here and at such a reasonable price. Jumped all over it. Thanks a million.
4,For everyone,"I have a background in chemistry so I have taken courses in quantum chemistry. I bought this book as a review since I haven't read anything on quantum physics for awhile and needed a refresher course. I found this book a little simple, but it is for everyone. If you don't have any experience in the field, I highly recommend this book."
4,Physics,I have found this book very easy to read and understand. It is great for people who want to know things regarding physics without a 'gob' of formulas to be confused with.
1,Stamp collecting,"Such as Rutherford once said: ""All science is either physics or stamp collecting"", this is what this book is, stamp collecting. It just gives you the names of bosons, leptons, this equation, that one, such and such, and gets to nowhere. The principles of quantum physics are introduced at the end of the book just to put them somewhere, becuase the structure of this book is a shame. It also fails delivering a feel of amazement to the reader, which in other words would be that this book is boring.In conclusion, before buying this book, think it twice, because if you look for an understanding of what quantum physics is, that is the thing this book is not about."
3,It's alright,"I enjoyed it, but then again, I'm a quantum physics major. It really deals more with particle physics to begin with, and only later brings quantum into sight. I still thought it was easy reading, though, and still entertaining. It kept my attention. However, for an easy introduction into quantum physics, I still feel that Jim Al-Khalili's book ""Quantum"" is a better read."
3,Review of 'The Quantum World',"Although the title suggests otherwise, this book is not intended for everyone. For that, it is too specific. That's why I expected a book which is a little more thorough. The collapse of the wave function is not treated at all for instance and the concept of wave function is only mentioned a few times, while it is one of the most mysterious items in quantum mechanics.The part about the elementary particles is ok, the same holds for the treatment about symmetry and conservation laws.All in all it's an entertaining book. But it remains too superficial to really give new insights."
3,Wish I Could Give it Higher Rating,"I really wanted to like and enjoy this book. I am interested in quantum physics and hoped this book would be fairly easy to understand for the average reader. I am no genius, but I am no dummy either, but this book is very dry and hard to follow. I appreciate Kenneth Ford's attempt to present quantum physics in a easy-to-follow manner, but in my opinion, he fails to do so. I do not think it is a poorly written book, and I have certainly garnered some interesting information from the book. However, I was hoping to find the book easy to understand, and enjoy reading it, instead of finding it tedious."
3,Missing pictures and diagrams - you must be kidding!,"The Kindle edition has many missing pictures and diagrams. In their place are the words, ""[To view this image, refer to the print version of this title.]"" Really???"
4,Needs the Diagrams,"The book is great in trying to understand the many terms in Quantum Mechanics. For some reason, many images and digrams are missing in the electronic version. Hopefully the next electronic edition can address this problem."
5,More than a popular book,"The book is great. Fundamental ideas of the quantum mechanics are explained in plain, clear and concise language. I think the book can be useful to undergraduate students who take a course on modern physics or a basic quantum mechanics course. I read ""The Quantum World"" in parallel with University Physics and Modern Physics and found this reading very enjoyable. But as a popular reading this book may be rather complicated. To people who don't have a relevant background in physics, before starting this book I would recommend ""Warped passages"" by Lisa Randall or ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian Greene."
5,A treasure to hold,"Perfect beauty - heavy in the hand, polished, a ring of copper showing through the base and a recipe for chocolate soufflé from Thomas Keller. It can't get any better. Except it can, because I can warm a perfect cup of tea or broth in it as well. I hand wash and wipe dry with soft floursack dish cloth. Then admire."
2,buyer beware,"The picture looks better than the product. There are only 5 sides. The sides are not even square, being about 4mm x 5mm. On regulation dice, the sum of opposite sides is supposed to be ""7"", but the 5 is opposite the 3 and the 4 is opposite the 2. The 6 is opposite nothing, as the ""1"" side is open. The presentation was very nice, a velvet drawstring bag within a gift box. With the cost of gold being what it is, this probably the best they can do for the price. Maybe you should buy a magnifier to go with it."
4,"RICH, ORIENTAL SCENT","Volupte is one of Oscar de la Renta's later scents. I think the first was his popular signature fragrance, Oscar. To me, Volupte is richly Oriental with notes of Jasmine, Mimosa, Incense, and Amber. I would recommend it for a woman who wants to make a statement, and for evening wear.Few have not at least heard the name Oscar de la Renta. He's an internationally acclaimed designer whose creations are both admired and desired.Born in the Dominican Republic he left his home to study in Spain. From there we went to Paris, and finally to New York to design for Elizabeth Arden. He began his own label in 1965, and since then his imprint has included jewelry, furs, handbags, shoes, furniture, and, of course, fragrances."
1,Rcelamo,"Buenos dias, tengo meses esperando este paquete y no ha llegado al buzon, por favor necesito que me resuelvan el caso. Muchas Gracias"
5,I love this perfume,"I have been wearing this perfume since I was in middle school. It was given as a gift to my mother but she didn't like the fragrance on herself but said it went well with my natural chemistry. I've been wearing it ever since. It's a mature fragrance that's light, crisp and floral."
5,OSCAR VOLUPTE',"THIS PRODUCT HAS SERVED ME FOR OVER 10 YEARS....ITS LIGHT AND I CAN HARDLY SMELL IT BUT EVERYONE ELSE CAN, AND THEY SAY I SMELL SO GOOD....NOT OVERBEARING. IT COMPLIMENTS MY BODY CHEMISTRY."
5,A book no childhood should go without,"This is one of those children books that you wont mind reading to you kids. Set in Toronto in an earlier part of the 20th Century, it follows the adventures of a set of twins trying to unwind the mysteries that surround their new house. The story is rich and imaginative and flashbacks create a sense mystery.Originally published ""Twin Spell"" this book is one of my all time childhood favourites. Don't let you child be without."
2,Not What I Expected,"Just couldn't get into this book. I read Tim Winton's ""Cloudstreet"" and thought it was amazing. After several pages in this one, I gave up which I don't ordinarily do."
3,A disappointment,"I consider myself a Tim Winton fan, having read several of his novels and short stories and regarded them as extraordinarily good, even great. Incredibly, I found myself thinking as I neared the end of ""Dirt Music"" that the novel was really getting tiresome. Too much wandering around in the woods, too much fishing, too much making love to the trees, too much tension around too many campfires. The descriptions are great, but they do go on, and on, and on. I felt little empathy with the main characters, who seem aimless, helpless, and shallow.A plus: the plot, such as it is, is so skillfully woven that suspense, such as it is, is sustained until the very end.I'm still a Tim Winton fan, but I found this book disappointing."
3,Good Australian Novel,"Tim Winton really has a way with Australian characters. He develops them like no-one else.This is a good story, not Winton's best, but still a good read.Good for a rainy afternoon"
3,Author Assumptions,"This book is captivation personified once you get into this author's particular style. The flow of words is a little too ""stream of consciousness"" and the author assumes that the reader will have some knowledge of common australian slang. Still, an emotionally riveting plotline, very much a romantic drama."
5,booker for sure,a poet pretending to be a novelist. the plot is lean but not the point. the descriptions of the loneliness of western australia fishing communities resonates.if this does not win the booker-impossible
5,A great surprise,"Dirt Music is a lyrical and scenic journey though Australia and the lives of Georgie, Jim and Lu. Winton writes in a way that made me itch from the biting mosquitos and sigh in the unrelenting heat."
4,Dirt Music is a Rhapsody of a Read,I normally will not finish a book that has no punctuation for dialogue (Cormack McCarthy is one of those authors I just cannot read). But Dirt Music is beautifully written and is easy to keep track of who is speaking and doing what. A dramatic love story. I enjoyed it very much.Heidi M. Thomasauthor of Cowgirl Dreams and Follow the Dream
5,Great keyboard,This is a very solid feeling keyboard with all the nice additional keys to make it easier to navigate the internet as well as control your computer's DVD/CDROM player. I like this keyboard so much that I use it on all my computers (four so far).
5,Keep on Rocking in the Free World,"From the ashes of Grade rises the formerly founded Somehow Hollow, who have raw passion, grit and sincere sensitivity which is the foundation of this album. The guitar work is impeccable and the singing is definately unique and heartfelt. Sounds blend heavy guitar riffs with band influences like MXPX, Saves the Day and The Getup Kids. I suggest reading the lyrics then blasting this CD on your stereo and singing along as loud as you can. It is a feel good album. Go buy it."
1,Buyer Beware! Incomplete Edition,Kessinger Publishers has reprinted only chapter 13 of The Christ of the Indian Road. The first 12 chapters are missing. This is nothing more than a pamphlet with most of the pages blank. The two other reviews included here are based on an earlier edition of the original book. This incomplete Kessinger edition was published December 2005.
4,Bert's Blues,"Just thought I'd mention that the Bert of ""Bert's Blues"" is Bert Jansch, who was a big influence on just about all British guitarists of the period.Donovan's gentle 60s lyricism may be out of fashion in this age of plastic disposable pop and gangsta rap, but all his early albums are still worth listening to if you like real music.PS There is now (2005) a new remastered and expanded version of this album available. Get that instead."
4,PSYCHEDELIC HEAVEN,"Through my childhood, teen years, and most of my adulthood, Iwas under the impression that DONOVAN was pretty much aboutbubblegum music(sorry about that Mr.Leitch). Now, in my middle-age, of all places, I find that this talented musician is amaster of psychedelica, right up there with SYD BARRETT, earlyPINK FLOYD, and other of my favorites. Heres to him. I wish Ihad discovered all this great music earlier in life. But not toworry, I'm making up for lost time, buying all I can get myhands on by this guy. I find that this release is a very goodone, and for '66, well before it's time. There is not a badsong on this c.d. I did not give it a fifth star due to the lackof information on the packaging, and I think that in this dayand age, they could have done more with the sound production quality.Thanks and keep on keepin' on,Tom"
4,Veronica is DEAD!,"The Fondled just came out of nowhere in the early 90's Punk scene and where never to be heard from again, but they left us the RAW masterpiece. It's just so unique, it's genius!"
4,Not a bad guide.. but don't rely solely on it.,"This is a great book to get you through a few tight spots in the game, but try not to rely on it too much. Once in a while you'll come across something in the game that the guide forgot, perhaps a well-hid item or the like.It may not be extremely detailed, but it'll get you through the game. There's also tips for beating bosses and there are screen shots of nearly every place in the game.Despite its lack of detail, this guide is most likely one of the more helpful game guides I own. A must buy if you're having trouble with Castlevania: SOTN."
3,Whats your due time ???,"BANE ,Alittle `SAW' & a tad `H P LOVECRAFT' this is a movie with some stuff to Frighten !So these ladies may have been kidnapped,That's pretty bad news.Some medical types are experimenting with/on them...Not good.Is that aCthulhu alien ???So,These factors are unsettling and then they get a `Time To Die' carved into their bodies.There is alot going on and the title BANE was never explained to our satisfaction,Were the producers playing off the release of new BATMAN film with the villian, BANE or is it the explaination of the word -a person or thing that ruins or spoils."
5,Fan,"I have gleamed a lot from these DVD's. I recommend them to anyone who is looking for self help in self esteem and learning to let go of the past. The company I purchased these from sent them on time, in the condition they said and for a good price. A recommend on both accounts."
4,"Great cards, but doesn't cover all the needed words!","These vocab cards are a great resource for people who are trying to memorize NT Greek vocab, especially those following along Mounce's Basics of Biblical Greek. The font is clear and readable and verbs include principle parts. The cards (after 320) are ordered alphabetically within frequency. But there's one major problem.The reason I give only 4 stars is that the cards don't cover all the words down to 10 occurrences! I'm wrapping up my second semester of 2nd year Greek where we're memorizing the vocabulary down to 10 occurrences and Mounce's vocabulary cards start skipping once you get down to 11 occurrences. I was very surprised and disappointed. It seems that to keep the cards to 1000 exactly, he skipped about 120 words in the 11 and 10 frequency range. I had to go and make my own."
3,Where are the verbal roots....?,"These cards are great for learning vocabulary. However, William Mounce, as part of his ""system"" for learning verbs, stresses the exact memorization of verbal roots as the key to recognizing all the different tense stems. For verbs, these cards list all the different tense stems that occur in the NT, but no verbal roots. In fact, ""Basics of Biblical Greek"" (the textbook) does not include the verbal roots for any verbs other than those occuring more than 50 times in the NT. Maybe memorization of the roots is not really essential. While it's not a show stopper by any means (you can usually figure out the root) if you are really trying to use the Basics of Biblical Greek ""system"" for learning verbs these cards lack a key component. Perhaps this is a way to get us all to purchase the Mounce morphology book."
1,I Bought a TDK DVD burner and have regretted it ever since.,"Every Time (without exception) I try to burn files to a DVD my computer locks up, I get a blue screen of death, I have to turn off the computer, restart it and go through the ""your computer has recovered from a serious error"" messages. Check other sorces for information but my recommendation is to seriously think twice before buying a TDK DVD burner."
2,"Chrome is a weak metal...compared to gold, silver, & platinum.","I could not wait to get this album. I usually love to hear the new the Hypnotize Minds albums. However after so many years groups do make mistakes. This is a major one. Chrome could suck his name off of a trailer hitch. I own the original copies of every Prophet/Hypnotize relese since Mystic Styles, and this is by far the worst to emerge. They never release a Lord Infamous solo album in 12 years (not to mention he is DJ Paul's brother...wait I just did) and now this??? What's next, a Crunchy Black album lol?? THIS IS A PERSONAL NOTE TO DJ PAUL AND JUICY J...PLEASE SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE AND RE-HIRE (at least) T-ROCK, GANGSTA BOO, MC MACK, AND BRIBE SOME JUDGES TO GET LORD INFAMOUS OUT OF JAIL!!!P.S.- This only gets 2 stars for the production value."
5,4.5 Star Effort,"Hypnotize Minds new artist Chrome really puts it down on this one. Once again HCP puts out a bangin' CD. Chrome starts off with a good track ""So Fresh"", which is followed by the track ""Bussem Up"", which would probrably be a good single off this album. A very crunk upbeat track. His album really delivers with the tracks ""I Learned"" (Which has an old modified Gangsta Blac beat), ""Inhale"", ""Quarter Key"", ""This Is My Life"", and ""If We Was Cool"". Chrome really shows he has what it takes to go Straight To The Pros. This album goes harder than many of the major deal albums you hear today. It seems that DJ Paul and Juicy J put out better albums for their artists' Chrome & Frayser Boy than they do their own. (Choices II & Most Known Unknown for Ex.) But anyways, go check out this Album, it is worth the money."
5,wow,"this was a big surprise. from what i heard of him on previous songs i like how he raps but his lyrics werent that godd. i had to buy it though because hes 3 6. this cd is the best cd to come out this year, along with the young jeezy and the bun b that just came out. its much better than frasier boy because theres no garbage songs on it, the whole entire cd rides. its the type of cd you hear each song and each song gets better and better towards the end. go get this cd so he does well and makes another one. best songs are my life, straight to the pros, 23 and 1"
3,Average,"I was some what disapointed with this cd. Ecspecially after hearing Chrome on the ""Most Known Unknown's"" he came hard on a few traks on there. There really isn't any songs that stand out to me on here and I guess that's why I'd say it's just average."
5,the best Hot sauce,this is one of the hottest hot sauces around and has great flavor..not just heat.. but believe me not for the faint at heart. it is hot...
5,Great Hot Sauce,"Amazingly tasty hot sauce with serious, but not lethal, heat. Very fragrant, fruity aroma & taste, lots of heat from the scotch bonnet peppers. Have had this with Indonesian food, grilled chicken, and even pizza. One of my favorite hot sauces because the flavor justifies the heat."
4,it was fun,diplomatic immunity was one of the funnest cd ive ever heard. which features a large amount of fun songs.
4,very good,this was a very good cd. so if your into rap music go get this cd. you won't be dissapointed.
2,Mayn They NeEd To LeArN HoW tO RaP!,"they really sucked lol ...... he like mixes his words and makes up his own words to rhyme to what he is saying, the only song I liked is get from round meeh! thats hard though. but everything else *()()(ing sucked . BAd!!!"
2,is that all??,"To call this cd a disappointment is an undertstatement, the whole cd seems thrown together with half-a** production and lyrics. Of course it was unrealistic for me to expect the same quality as the 1st diplomatic immunity, but damn.....i guess i'll half to wait for cam's cd for redemption. i guess thats why this cd wasn't on roc-a-fella"
2,Alright,"This cd is ok it has alot of old songs,but there are some really goos singles such as ""S.A.N.T.A.N.A"",""Push It"",""Take em to Church"",""Crunk Muzik"",and ""Bigger Picture"".This cd is subpar compared to the first one.It is good in showcasing the rest of the dipset fam besides cam,juelz,and jones."
4,the greatest,this was by far the best album ive ever heard. which features alot of songs that sound superb.
4,excellent cd,thsi was an excellent cd from the diplomatats. and i could see that they put alot of effort on this cd.
4,Album is hott,"While this DIPLOMAT album may not be as good as there first it still goes hard! How can DIPLOMATS get one star and EM get 4 for his wack album. The DIPLOMATS do what they do.....nothing more. If you expect that conscious rap you picking up the wrong album. This album is STR8! DIP SET BIRD GANG, I thouht you knew. They murder Mr. Mase Beatha while keeping it crunk."
1,nothin like the first album,"this album was not near as good as the first diplomats. killa cam is the man, but damn dude, what happened? the best songs on this cd cam put on his new cut, purple haze, which was like 2 or 3 songs . if i could go back in time, i would NOT have bought this. buy cam's new one, not this!!!"
1,Wow what crap,"This is just crap sounds like they got loaded and made an album. I dont know how this crap makes to stores, this should be banned for being crap. Lyrics and prodiction on this cd are crap. AGAIN do not buy you will regret. Save your money for crack u will get something out of that."
3,"NOTHIN' ON THA FIRST ONE, BUT IT'S COOL","I DON'T KNOW WHATS WRONG W/ THESE OTHER CUSTOMERS. YEAH I DIDN'T LIKE IT WHEN I FIRST HEARD IT, BUT I FEEL THAT WAY TO ALL MY CDs. I NEVER JUDGE CDs UNTIL I LISTEN TO EM' MORE THAN ONCE. THIS CD BE JAMMIN'. ON THE COOL THOUGH, IT LOOK LIKE MY JUELZ IS STARTIN' TO FALL OFF A LIL BIT. HE STILL GOT THE FLO, BUT HE SAY ""YEAH!"" TOO MUCH. IT GET ANNOYING. BUT THIS CD STILL BE JAMMIN'. THE BEST BEAT I EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE IS ON THIS CD. MELALIN. AW MAN THAT'S A THOWD BEAT. I'D RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE."
4,Philosophical and Computational,"Excellent philosophical and computational insights into creativity. Useful discussion of various methods of generating music and the benefits and drawbacks of each, alongside discussion of the voice leading, tension, allusions, and structural hierarchy analysis a human would do when researching existing or composing new works.Also interesting are the human responses to computer generated classical music: ""I haven't heard it, but it sucks"" (music critic) to ""this isn't computer music because it is classical"" (computer music publishers) to ""this isn't classical music because it was recently composed"" (classical publishers)."
1,Absolutely useless,This is a very poorly written book. Contains nothing but explanations of the menu items. Even then it is much less useful than the inside FrontPage help. Absolutely useless if you have a problem. I got nothing but frustration from this book. Wouldn't recommend to anybody.
3,Deconstructing before constructing,"Warbled vocals on top of jarring, fragile guitar work at first recalls Neutral Milk Hotel in more electric distortion context and then Pavement minus much of the melodic intelligence. But after a poor start, a surprising amount of intricacy amidst all the lo-fi sloppiness begins to take shape, and the band manages to make an impression all their own. Frequent time changes interspersed with druggy sing-alongs create a unique fusion of slacker-indie and math-rock."
2,No Go,"With all the great ""nature videos"" out there this one really cannot keep up. Outdated, very poor color photography, ever repeating photos and the same old fish. This has all the pizzaz of a grade 4, in class, horror.Hello, forget this one."
3,Not sure if it's working,"I started giving two squirts (he's 20 lbs.) of this in my dog's water every morning for two weeks. We saw two dead spots on our lawn but I'm not sure if that's from a previous pee that's now showing dead grass or if we haven't waited long enough. I have noticed that his breath doesn't stink as much. That's a positive. In all, it's kind of expensive if I'm not sure whether the product works or not. I'll finish out this bottle (I got hte 32 oz.) and if I see any more spots, I'll update this review."
1,Didn't see any difference,"The product arrived with the exterior of the bottle and the packing materials soaking wet; the bottle was half empty. The seller was responsive and offered to replace the item immediately, but I opted to just have seller refund half the price (since half the product was gone.). I used the product for some weeks; saw no difference in my lawn. Well, it was worth a try!"
1,will not work on new mountain lion os,"this is an awesome game, however, this version, unbeknownst to me at the time of purchase, is for Mac's old operating system Snow Leapord and so it won't work on my new one, mountain lion. Wish they would have told me that before I boutght it."
2,"A nice idea, but not well implemented.","I bought this book for my 5 year-old, who is in Kindergarten and working every day to practice her letters. The structure of the book is fine, but the overall size of the letters is much too large. Children at this stage are by now writing with pencils, and the size of these letters forces them back to crayons. This might work for younger children who are unused to pencils, but I honestly don't think a 3 year old needs to worry about forming D'Nealian letters properly. Had the letters been smaller this would have been fine. I felt the same way about Book 2 in this series as well."
4,Great Service,"Oz Clarkes Grapes and Wines showed up quickly, and in great shape, and I am enjoying using it with my studies. Thanks so much!"
4,A good cleaner with a clean smell of its own.,"As one of my cats tends to be troublesome and doesn't always seem to find the litter box when she needs it... I spent a TON of time hunting for the best cleaner for cat urine stains. After reading countless reviews I purchased a few different cleaners, and this one is very good! Both odor and stain practically vanish when you spray it one the area, a tiny bit of scrubbing and it is completely gone - for good!If you have trouble with cat urine stains, this product is great!EDIT: Upon further use and review, I have found the smell of this product itself to be too strong for my liking. While it does its job well, I prefer some other products that do not have as much of a perfume scent. My long term favorite and most recommended stain and odor remover has to beNature's Miracle."
2,Very disapointed in this product,We have a new puppy who we are house training. So I bought this product to remove the stain and odors associated with her pee. While it does remove the stain with lots of scrubbing it does not remove the ordor at all. I have tried scrubbing the spot over and over to remove the smell but it is still present. Very dissapointed in this product!
3,Good Enough,"purchased this product based on reviews given. product is good enough, but not as effective as I expected. Have cleaned pee stained carpet twice now and still a smell present. Will do it a third time and I am pretty confident the odor will be gone. Not a bad product, but not as effective as expected."
4,It seems to do the job.,I don't smell urine anymore and the stains seem to be disappeared. I'm hoping it stays like this but so far so good!
3,what the packaging happened here...,"I havent used this product just yet but when I received it, it was wrapped in plastic and had leaked all over the place."
3,I would have liked to have tried it.,But the way it was packaged the bottles got broken in transit and the liquid all poured out. So there was nothing for me to try.
4,no room for saucers,I like the look of the storage container. I found there is no room for the saucers if you have cups and saucers.
2,Chamaco's solo album.,"The story behind this album is that producer/arranger Javier Vazquez had prepared most of its songs for Ismael Rivera to record--when that became impossible, however, Chamaco Ramirez was chosen to record them (a very logical choice given the fact that both singers had very similar street-flavored and very funky singing styles). Unfortunately, this reissued CD's sound quality is nothing short of shameful and appalling and thus limits your ability to enjoy it. Chamaco Ramirez undoubtedly WAS one of the all-time greatest soneros but you'll want to prove it with the classic Tommy Olivencia ""Plante Bandera"" CD."
4,Still going strong.,"Sammy Gonzalez had just left the band to join Los Torbellinos. Tito Cruz filled in for him in this 1977 release.""Los Demas"" is a rather strange yet pretty nice song with an unusual combination of violin, drum and flute that somehow finds a way to make it work for me. My choice for best song is obviously ""Marejada Feliz"" which saves this album from getting a lower rating. Ironically ""Hay Que Saber Comenzar"" starts off really slow and boring to be quite frank. Midway into the tracks, it seems like a completely different song, full of swing and just excellent musicianship. ""Que Me Lo Den En Vida"" is a different but, very good version of the one done by Montanez and El Gran Combo. ""Nadie Sabe"" is another nice song penned by none other than Ruben Blades. The album is not as great as # 5, nonetheless a pretty decent one. Not exceptional, but better than average."
2,Just so you know....,"This is not the original Stan Getz version of ""Girl from Ipanema"" that you are looking for. For that, and for many other fine Astrud Gilberto performances, you must track down a copy of ""Astrud Gilberto's Finest Hour"" which is a greatest hits collection of her sixties work, with good liner notes."
1,Horrible version!,"I love Astrud Gilberto & was really looking forward to this CD arriving, but it's some awful butchering. Her voice is the only redeeming aspect, but who can concentrate on that over the disco easy listening? This sounds more like the soundtrack to Fantasy Island."
1,terrible,"I'd heard The Girl from Ipanema (another recording) and decided to purchase it. Should have done my research. This high pitched, strained version hurts the ears. I couldn't get it to the cd store for trade in fast enough."
1,Only last 3 months - don't waste your money,I loved this trimmer - easy to use and clean. However after only 3 months of use (1x every 2 weeks) it just died. I stored without the battery and it just quit working one day. I thought the Epilady brand would last.
1,busted and sticky...,"the seller goodman's sent me an epilady that had a sticky handle and it didn't even work with a brand new battery. i sent it back to them, hopefully they will send me one that works...but beware!"
5,Great for other places too,"I originally bought this for a bikini trimmer but after the eyebrow trimmer I ordered turned out to be a flop, I ended up trying this on my eyebrows as well. There's just enough lift to trim them a little bit without taking too much off, even then you can take off the guide and trim down further. I've also used it for spots that I miss during shaving as well, and even if it isn't totally smooth, it's still better. I've been considering getting another so I could have one exclusively for bikini trimming and the other for all the other uses it has.Keep in mind this is a trimmer. It won't get it smooth, but it will cut the hair pretty close."
1,These break quickly,"Although this shaver works, it breaks very quickly. Trust me, I am on my third one and have decided to switch brands. I bought the first one and it worked for six months, so I bought a second one thinking that the first one was a fluke. The second one broke, so I ordered a third and final one. Why did I order three? I don't really know, folks, but now you have a tried and true reviewer on your hands. This product will work for about three to six months and then some part of it WILL break. What a piece of junk!!!"
2,Weak power,"This item worked terribly. I tried it once and gave up. It has no power, even with fresh batteries. Better to spend more money and get a better product."
3,Steady Hand,"The Epilady B Bikini Trimmer is not the best choice for those seeking ""brazilian"" qualities in their grooming. Against the skin, the blades are rough and can even nip. Beware. This trimmer calls for a steady hand."
3,"loved it at first, but then ........","Ok, my husband bought me the pink and white one that can be used in the shower, well I had the perfect length of hair on my legs so I used it (got used to the minor pain) and I absolutely loved it,, until, my hair on my legs started to grow back into my skin, like I could see the hair on my leg, but it was just underneath the skin, so I would scratch and scratch it out until it stood up and my epilady could grab it , problem is there were a lot of hairs like this, so all the scratching it up made marks on my legs for weeks. It would be a great product if they could figure out how to not make your hair grow back beneath your skin. Maybe I just have weird hair growth, has anyone had the same thing happen."
3,Decent Biography,"This is a decent overview of King Haakon of Norway, it doesn't go into a in depth detail. But it does give you the background of Norway at the time he was 'voted' as King of Norway as well as during the times of both World Wars. Basically this biography is more or less written as a paper one would read as if it was written by a student of history for a master's degree program."
5,wow.,"I love this briefcase - I ordered it in yellow - but it was only available in the blue - which was 'ok' - (i REALLY wanted yellow) --- the quality of this bag is superior - the leather is very nice - has a padded handle which is very comfortable to use... it's rather 'large' - which means it gets heavy when loaded down (I'm a Rev. so I have everything in there from bottled water to my soundtracks, Bible, messages - etc) .. you can fit ALOT in it .... I ONLY WISH the two front pockets would unzip alllllllllll the way instead of just from side of bag to top/center. I know those two front pockets were only planned to hold wires, etc - but I have oodles of items in there and they are a tad hard to 'get to' with the pocket not opening 100%."
3,Obscure Motown,"This is a beautifully packaged set. However, this is not the most familiar Motown material. For semi-serious completists, it's a treat!"
4,Product itself is good but shipping was over priced,"The product itself is a Great product, but the bottle is much smaller than it looks and upon arrival the product itself was only $3.99 but I spent over $7.00 for it with Shipping so not sure if it's worth that price."
1,BIG DISLIKE,"This moisturizing oil smells bad, is too greasy, and weigh my hair down. It does not complement with any of the other oil that I use.What a waste of my money:("
5,Great Biography,"What an amazing biography about an astounding psychologist! Definitely a must read for anyone ""out"" in the field of psychology. Also, great for anyone interested in historical steps made by leaders of the APA community!"
3,Excellent historical account--just rather impersonal,"This book is well-written and covers a lot of ground; it was just too impersonal for my tastes. The book starts out with the air of a traditional memoir, but towards the latter half it changes tone and becomes more of an historical account. It's an excellent history of the gay/lesbian rights movement as seen through Berzon's eyes; unfortunately, if you're not familiar with the players in that movement then it's easy to lose your bearings. Berzon's rise from the depths is inspiring, however, no matter what your background. It just got lost for me in all the names and dates towards the end of the book."
4,Get your fundamentals here!,This book will really begin your fundamentals! Not having this means you really will need 8 years of photography school! This is the beginning!
3,Not good for beginners,This book jumps straight into the different techniques and does not explain simple lighting concepts much at all. I also thought that the styles blurred together and he didn't separate them out enough and explain the differences between each one.
4,Instructive,It 's a book instructive for those who want to broaden their horizons on the use of lights. Very interesting.
2,Wouldn't recommend for a beginner,"There is a lot of good information in this book, but if you are a beginner I wouldn' suggest it."
1,Kindle version: Smurf edition,"I just purchased the Kindle version and, unfortunately, it is unusable, and I can't review the content, as the color images all have horrific color shifts rendering everyone's skin as blue. I've requested a refund and will likely be staying with (used) print copies of photo books for future purchases. Doesn't anyone check these after they're converted?"
4,Great Book,I have advanced in my photography skills a great deal from this book. My lighting has become just as artistic as the shots themselves. Alot of the ideas in the book are just fun to play around with to help create your own kinda lighting. A must read for those not to new but would like to make the next leap...
5,"Great content, well written","I was very impressed with this book. Mr. Grey has done a fantastic job writing this book. It's obvious that he's very accomplished at his craft and has logged countless hours refining his skills. He also explains each scenerio with enough detail to make his intentions perfectly clear. All of the images in the book are crisp, sharp and well composed. Each sample includes a two dimensional diagram of the lighting configuration. Since there is no third dimension to the diagrams it is sometimes hard to tell if a light was placed high or low in relationship to the model and the other light. Mr. Grey does explain the configuration in the narrative so it's not that hard to figure out the height of a light in the diagram. Great book. I highly recommend it for a portrait primer. Side note - The cover picture is fantastic. It's a great representation of the quality of the book."
2,Has some serious flaws,"I was excited to get this book, because I want to get into lighting. I was hoping for a section describing fluorescent ""always on"" lights, and the tradeoffs between them and strobes. But he doesn't mention this at all. It's all about strobes. I'm sure strobes are the way to go, but I'm very sorry he doesn't say why.Also, he got the f-stop chart wrong. He says f/4 is one stop below f/8, and that's just wrong. I wonder if he knows what a stop is, because he talks in the text as though stops are all powers of 2, rather than powers of square root of 2.I'd look for something else."
4,"A very good book!,","This is the material that is ausent here, in Uruguay. I believe the reviews before published, were right!! and I'm very pleasant to recommend this book!"
3,decent but outdated,This book is decent but a bit outdated. The photos are too 80s and do not reflect techniques or the look that are reflective of our time.
5,very grateful for christopher grey's Master lighting guide,"Having read this book , and put it into practice, my Flash images are improving all the time, and every time I re read the book My work gets better and better ! thanks so much Christopher."
5,"Enough said, buy it!","Enough people that are far smarter than I have written very descriptive essays almost on why this is a great book to buy. That being said, I will just say I concur, buy it! As a beginner, I found it very eye opening and invaluable."
2,"Too vague, not very useful","The author is no doubt a great photographer, but the book is less then ideal. The book covers what light types are out there, and only gives a few examples of how to place them. There is far too much detail in some areas, which are not followed through in practical examples. The second half of the book diverts away from its title as well. What subject matter is covered, concentrates too heavily on expensive lighting set-ups as well. I think there is some useful information here, but not worth the money."
5,just what i was looking for!,I like that the book diagrams the set-ups. It's a very easy to understand recipe book for basic lighting.As a newbie to strobes it is exactly what I have been looking for.
3,Anyone else get a copy with poor image quality?,"The only reason I gave this three stars is because of the good quality of the music and the opportunity to see the original ""Rockit"" video. Based on the quality of the DVD imagery I would give it a one. Is there anyone else who finds this DVD to be low-quality and grainy (especially the ""Rockit"" video), or did I get some kind of bootleg?"
4,Glen Plaid,I totally love my new set...but did not know that glen plaid was in the background. I would have preferred solid brown as the pictures seemed to suggest. But even with that said I'm pretty pleased with it.
1,not at THIS price...,That much for one freaking duvet? Geez...I should note here that the picture is very much washed out. The colors are really a rich dark chocolate and that pinkish stuff is a rich burgundy. Just sayin'.
5,"Nice cookbook, beings back memories",These recipes are very easy to follow. Also it brings back memories of my childhood of when I grew up down the street from Disneyland. The food at Disnyland was always good. This allows you to bring home a taste of Disnyland.
4,worth the purchase,"Been to almost every restaurante in Disney resorts, and the recipes I have prepared are identical in taste."
1,2bad they re is no bullet available,honestly besides hiphop thats one of the worst project i ever heard but she was beautiful with travolta one more pretty face who d better remain only so
2,Sigh,"Just when these books were getting better, this one came along. This plot is jsut a repeat of what happened to Cindy and Ashliegh, with the exception of Melanie's problmes with Kevin. The author who wrote ths obviously doesn't know much about racing because when she was writing about the race she didn't do that great. I dunno, but this book jsut rubbed me the wrong way. Also, Sierra was never gelded. In book #9, He was almost sold ot a stud farm, and for that he had to be a stallion. Mike thought about gelding him in #8, but he never did."
3,Good but some stuff is wrong,"This book was okay, better than the last one's about Christina. But the plot is the same as two other Throroughbred books. It already happened to Ashleigh and Cindy. They got all oppseesed with horses and let everything else fall. Can't they think of something else? Also some of you were talking about Seria (sp?) he was not gelded because Mike said his bloodlines were too good and wasn't sold to a stud farm beacuse Mike liked the idea of steeplechasing him. Siera fell of the face of the earth practically when Glory came along. Also, Is it just me or does this cover look a whole lot like the cover from Pride's Challenge? 2 riders racing each other."
3,It's alright,"I like how the series is slowly coming back to racing. That's cool, but the only thing is, why on earth are Kevin and Melanie wearing silks on the cover? and why does Melanie look like a boy? I can't tell her and Kevin apart. Don't get me wrong, It' a cool story but there's just ome flaws, that's not the writer fault. Any ways I like Melanie, to bad Pirate's blind, he'd be an awesome race horse, in the future he and Melanie could have raced together while Christina had tar or what ever. I recommend it."
3,Joanna Campbell REALLY needs to get back into TB!,"I ordered this book through Amazon and read it in a matter of a few hours. It was a decent story but it's been played out already with Cindy and Max. It's great that Melanie wants to become a jockey and she has a love of it. Kevin, on the other hand, was just doing it for his father's attention. This doesn't seem good enough motivation for the character! He just seemed like a spoiled brat with his comments about the new horse. And I really dislike Christina. She is such a brat most of the time. Joanna really needs to come back to the series and start writing for it again. These second-rate authors who have taken up the job are ruining the series and the characters. Whatever happened to Ashleigh's other baby? I could write a Thoroughbred book better than some of these new authors. At least I could keep the facts straight...."
1,Dead Heat,"One word: Disgusting. I refuse to put anything else in. Also, why is Melanie and Kevin wearing SILKS when they are not jockeys?"
2,ridiculous!,"I have not read this book yet but i have to agree with most of the other readers, more racing,more joanna!The new authurs should stick with the same story,and not leave out the old favorite characters, like Tor,Sammy,Cindy,etc.Also bring back the other horses!"
5,Thoroughbred is GREAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Hey I love reading thoroughbred but I wish Joanna would come back writting it. I can answer all your commonly asked questions!!! First off in Thoroughbred #31 it says when their in N.Y CINDY is attending a school of riding or somthing of the sort! Sam and Tor are married and have an eventing(??????????? Why eventing I don't Know!)stable called Wisper wood. Brad and Lavinia have a son named Parker and he is nice but they are still the snobby people they always were! I am glad there getting into racing! But Christina and Dylan and Keven and Mel well I think Kissing Going out in eight grade is a little much. But other wise I guess it GREAT!
2,Don't take chances just to save a little $,"I bought one of these as a temporary ""main"" computer to replace my ancient PII 350mhz Gateway (which can still run Windows 2000 quite smoothly, albeit a bit slowly), until I could afford a better PC. I should've just waited a bit longer and skipped the middle step. Windows XP, reliable in the experience of most, failed several times and/or the hard drive failed several times. Tech support is not a toll-free number. Their advice was sketchy at best. I returned this thing within the 14 days I had to do so."
3,T1600 desktop,"Just purchased the T1600 emachine desktop and I, like another reviewer have problems with my modem. I can get on AOL, but will loose it after one or two minutes. If I'm lucky, maybe 5 min. My two old computers have never had this problem. This new emachine is now only 3 days old.I called their support department, which I think must be a long distance charge(?), and they act as if they are not aware of this apparent problem. I now have to decide if I'm taking it back to Costco's or work to correct the problem. It's a lot of computer for the money but it's not worth anything if it's not dependable. I understand Emachines are trying to improve their reputation, maybe I should have waited for that to happen. This is my third computer in 6 years and it's hard to believe that I have these problems right out of the box. Who has time for that?"
5,Great Seller,"Greqat Seller, good product at a very reasonable price. Will deal with again for my bicycle needs."
2,Sunlite MTB Raised Center Tire 26x 1.5Black tread/ Gum Wall,"The tires are of average quality. please be sure you want gum wall tires, as this tire has a yellow/tan side wall,NOT BLACK AS THEPICTURE SHOWS!I would not have purchased this tire, if the the advertizement pictured showed a yellow/tan side wall, its clearly black in the picture! Please update your product picture, to include the actual product being sold. The tires have a brand name of Kenda on the side wall,not Sunlite."
3,Just a variation,"of John Carpenters ""The Thing"" An alien takes over a human body. That's it. Nothing original. I liked it but I liked ""The Thing better."""
1,"First Half Great, Second Half AWFUL!","WOW this movie is truly awful towards the end, decent special effects cannot save a really bad last 30 minutes, I almost stopped the movie it was so bad...Seems to be a trend in Hollywood to have a good movie for the first hour or so, but then to quickly drop into plotless, pointless action towards the end (eg ConAir, The Rock, Independence Day)...If you like good horror science fiction (eg Aliens, The Hidden, The Thing, Blade), DO NOT get this movie... If you like bad sci-fi (Independence Day), then you may like it..."
2,why did i watch this,"I have no idea why i even sat through this. I was watching tv the other night because there was nothing better to do, this is one of the worst sci-fi movies i have ever seen in my entire life. its so bad, go watch something good like the abyss(1989)"
3,sex and alliens,"well, it seems that they had to make a movie where Alliens and humans have sex, it was creepy, it was gross, it was fun!"
3,A decent Sci FI Horror Erotica esc film.,"Species is the first in a trilogy of mankind being stupid and creating a alien human hybrid who's soul purpose is to mate. In this chapter some scientist come across this mysterious DNA which belongs to an Alien. They don't have a full strand so they decide to mix it with Human DNA creating this new creature. However once it gets loose all hell breaks loose as it's soul purpose is to reproduce, meaning lots of sex and or nudity.Overall this is a decent film, nothing spectacular but if your too embarressed to watch the real stuff than this can make for an entertaining time."
4,"""I'm foreign""",Pretty good sci-fi/action/horror/semi-comedy. Probably amust-have for sci-fi collectors and definitely a must-havefor Natasha Henstridge fans.The best parts (and most humorous) are the scenes whereSil (Henstridge) is trying to figure out how to operate inEarthly society. I would have given the show five stars if acouple more such scenes were included in place of some ofthe slower and/or more predictable scenes in the latter halfof the film.
3,":| Good plot, sad graphics.","I've seen computer games from this era with better graphics, and it was quite distracting towards the end. Enjoyed the beginning part of this film, where she's trying to adapt to a strange new world. Did have some weird kink to it. I would have liked it more if I was a bit less sober."
4,Entertaining,"R rating is for real ladies and gentlemen. Don't buy this for your kid.Characters had an alright amount of depth, Forest Whitaker was the best character for sure. Decent amount of action balanced with some slower parts. Nudity, even though it's alien nudity... I don't want to spoil it, but the end has a pretty hilarious surprise.Story was average on the interesting scale and they lined it up for the second and third installments (which sucked, just fyi). So, buy this if you want a 1/2 decent story with 1/2 decent character development, action and some alien nudity."
4,Species special edition,"Great movie if you're looking for senseless sci-fi action, and not too interested in getting to know the characters. The quality of the DVD was great - picture sharp, sound was outstanding. Should also be advised there was a lot of above the waist nudity, but seeing as how the plot was based on a hybrid alien/human that escapes execution in a lab, then follows her motherly instincts to reproduce, well.... you kind of have an idea going into the movie what it's all about."
1,Poor Quality DVD's,"I Enjoyed Species and give the movie 3 1/2 stars. My complaint is with the DVD. I returned one due to a defect in that trying to run the trailer locks up my DVD player. Amazon graciously replaced it but the 2nd DVD did the same thing. This gives both a wide screen and standard screen format, but selecting formats is difficult and can only be done in the first minute or so of inserting the DVD. Also it takes a long time to actually start viewing the movie.I have had problems with other DVD's made my MGM and it is obvious that they do not set a very high standard on producing quality DVD's"
3,Unoriginal,"Sure. The plot is. But everything else isn't. The end scene whenever the monster falls into the oily fire is a cheat off of ""Terminator 2."" The monster segments seem like a cheat of the Alien series.And the list goes on. But the best thing about it is the suspense. It's very action packed, and it moves at a good pace. Worth renting, but not buying."
4,Its a good movie but lacks the special effects.,"It starts out kind of slow but near the end it picks up speed. Although it re-uses some of the same effects from other movies, it still has a ""few"" parts that keep you on the edge of your seat."
3,"A three-part film: good, okay, and very bad.","""Species"" can be divided up into thirds. The first third of the film is original, interesting, and very entertaining. The second third is only so-so, as it gets bogged down and runs adrift in certain areas--still passable though. The third part of the film is a bad joke. It's obvious no one knew how to end this film, so they copied an ending from a few extremely bad B-movies (and didn't even do those justice!!). For a film to start so well, and end up so badly (it becomes high camp, really), is a mystery to me. Between 1 and 10, ""Species"" gets a very marginal 5, and just on the strength of the first third of the film (I think I'm being extremely generous here, because it turned into a real stinker)."
1,Fast Paced Junk,"I think ""Species"" moves at a fast clip before it becomes evident that it's a piece of junk. The performances are stilted (considering the cast of normally fine actors)and there is a particularly cruel sequence involving a kidnapped woman and her eventual fate. Ironically the actress playing the abducted woman gave the best performance in the film."
2,Bad PQ,"This release suffers from bad PQ as it is only slightly better than the dvd release. Very disappointing for a blu-ray release. In fact, the PQ is the worst in my 30+ BD collection."
1,Has a worse sci-fi movie EVER been made?,"Ben Kingsley, you really must have needed the money. Natasha Hentsridge was cast solely for that gorgeous body of hers; the producers knew that they had a ridiculously bad film on their hands and had to give the target audience some reason not to complain. But complain I will, because I want something resembling a real plot in my sci-fi; I want stimulation for more than just my groin; I want my sense of plausibility to be stretched, not tossed aside. This film is a mish-mash of retread effects, no thrills whatsoever and way too many, ""Oh, we just missed her again by seconds, so let's chase her some more!"" Wretched, simply wretched. Species, since it's release, has been the movie by which I judge all others - for awfulness. Whenever I see a truly terrible sci-fi movie, the first thought that comes to mind is, ""Well, it was better than Species."""
2,"First third is OK, ending is a joke.","I agree with the reviewer who said its split in thirds. Ist OK, 2nd is nowhere and third is a joke. The ending is just an attempt at Alien, they even have the same length of straps on the flame throwers. Its a pity to see Gigers work going to such a waste. The babe is beautiful but you only get that in the first third."
1,Cruel,"The film is a less than good example of the genre with not a single lead character that I cared anything about. The treatment of the woman, whom the alien takes captive after jumping into her car, is one of the cruelest things I have ever witnessed in a movie. I try to give particular reasons as to why I think a film is successful or fails. This film is not worth that kind of exploration. ""Species"" is just a piece of junk."
1,"Started Decent, Last 30 Min is AWFUL SCHLOCK!","WOW this movie is truly awful towards the end, decent special effects cannot save a really bad last 30 minutes, I almost stopped the movie it was so bad...Seems to be a trend in Hollywood to have a good movie for the first hour or so, but then to quickly drop into plotless, pointless action towards the end (eg ConAir, The Rock, Independence Day)...If you like good horror science fiction (eg Aliens, The Hidden, The Thing, Blade), DO NOT get this movie... If you like bad sci-fi (Independence Day), then you may like it..."
1,better new?,"Perhaps if I had seen this when it first came out, I might have rated it higher, but I doubt it. I agree with others - with the cast including Kingsley, how could it be this bad? And they came out with Species II????? Phew!!"
2,Horrible alien/horror porn.,"This film (if it can be called such) is a rip from Alien, mixed with a bad porn flick. Don't bother."
3,Fine,"It's fine. Don't watch it and expect it to be the greatest science fiction movie that has ever made, but it's entertaining."
4,"Cult movie, but like it.","This movie I put in the group with Mimic. (oddly enough the sequels fell off at about the same pace. Mimic 2 is not bad) Although there is a lot of nakedness, it's still a cool movie. The acting lineup is great, and of course they chose a hottie to be naked all the time. I recommend seeing this movie just because it's a good show. I bought it, and it's in my rotation of movies that I'll watch again."
3,a must see,"i have the 2 and 3 versions indiviually and i wanted to complete the trilogy. too bad the actors presented their best at different times instead of as an ensemble. if you are a straight guy, you would enjoy Natasha's nudity....and i am a straight guy!!! sorry ladies"
4,Sil is HOOOOOOTTTTTT!,"Having just watched Species and Species II, I decided to write something about it.After receiving this weird communication from space, scientists clone human and alien DNA together, creating Sil, a hybrid human'alien. But soon, the scientists attempt to kill her, and in a rage, she escapes.Now alone in the city, Sil rapidly grows, and begins to try to find a mate. But each time she becomes frustrated by them and kills them. Another team of specialists hunts her down, to stop her from giving birth, this leads to this, that leads to that and we end up with a big, if cheesy, fight scene in a sewery underground place. Pretty cool.I think the alien Sil looked cool, if a bit fake, and the acting from Henstridge actually makes you feel bad for Sil.If you liked Alien but wanted some sex and a lot of Henstridge's (...), then watch it. For all straight men."
5,"Species, a suprisingly good horror movie","This movie would have been bad, but then Natasha Henstridge walks around without any clothes. She has a very nice body. So i give the movie 5 stars. Natasha naked is a must see. You must watch this movie!!"
5,Bobby H & Tommy Flanagan Magic!,"This 1991 recording features magnificent ensemble playing with two jazz greats backed by a drummer and bass. The playing is superb as you would expect from two well established jazz stars. Additionally, the recording by Orin Keepnews, long time jazz recordist/producer, is exceptionally good with great soundstage featuring cymbles that shimmer and snap as if in front of your face. This release is another testimony why Tommy Flanagan is one of jazz's great piano players. His tone, pacing and playing can only be described as elegant, tasteful, and lovely. This is beautiful-fireplace-put-up-your-feet-open-a-bottle-of-wine music. Tasteful and beautiful, a treat for the senses."
3,Take a drive...,"I think that this CD is perfect for taking that casual, care-free long drive down your favorite strip, preferrably during the summer and just before the evening sets in. This is part of a series by Label M that reissues rare albums that are at times so blaze that I don't understand why they weren't taken advantage of in more of an abundance. The music forces you to just be still and just enjoy Hutcherson setting mellow moods with the vibes, and between his and Flanagan's solos on the piano, they're not overly complicated, but you don't need anything complicated when you're trying to enjoy that smooth drive down you favorite strip, thinking happy and relaxing thoughts."
3,Two Totally Different Rings!,"I just recently bought this ring for the second time and I have to say I am very disappointed. The first time around I bought it for myself and I absolutely loved it. It was perfect. The sizing was amazing and it didn't turn my finger green. It was a great middle finger ring. I wore it all the time. I went out of town and ended up forgetting it at the hotel I was staying at. By the time I realized I wasn't wearing it, it was too late to go back and get it. I re-ordered it and I'm disappointed. The ring itself is a lot thinner than the first one I got. It seems like it could break at any moment. After wearing it for a day it already started turning my finger green and showing discoloring in the ring itself. Also, at the bottom of the ring there is a big clip in the band. Overall, I loved the ring the first time around but the second time I was very disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"Quilter's Newsletter has always impressed me with the eye-catching quilts on its covers. However,the patterns inside are typically the more simplilstic, run-of-the-mill design so I was anxious to have access to construction details for some of the more stunning cover quilts. The book did not live up to my expectations.The first 22 pages of the book are devoted to a tedious history of the magazine. Of the 15 patterns included, only three or four are of the artistry and caliber that I had come expect from a QNM cover and hoped to use as inspiration for my own designs. In addition the instructions and color placements are difficult to follow. For these reasons I feel the book is an overpriced collection of 15 patterns."
3,Great,"Received this great book, has some great quilts that Iwould want to make, It came in a timely manner, like new."
2,Not worth the money,"It's a pleasant-enough book to get from the library and look at for 15 minutes, but I don't think it's worth the price to buy. These are one-of-a-kind quilts from the covers of Quilter's Newsletter Magazine and I can't imagine anyone wanting to replicate these patterns."
1,It's bad!,"Just when you think you found the bottom, something comes along the redefines the phrase ""B horror"". This has got it all: Bad acting, video quality that looks like a home movie (porno quality), bad special FX, lack of blood (they black out the screen when someone is being killed). This is has got it all: bad fake blood, papier-mché devil's mask (probably purchased at a Halloween shop), tapioca pudding dripping from a stove (I'm not joking), delayed sound (when someone hits someone, you see the hit before you heard the hitting sound), worse maiming scene in a horror movie (you will watch a girl demon sissy hit a guy, she never even touches him, then the next scene shows his shirt ripped up) Its bad....VERY BAD!"
2,whatever.,"Ok. There's some ugly naked girls(BUT THE ONLY HOT ONE DOESN'T SHOW 'EM WTF), we know that for a fact. There's a storyline, I guess. This video entices people to kill, and if they don't everyone dies.If you have any ability to appreciate indie films, you won't even notice the low production values. I mean, if you're complaining about the way this film is shot, you have no right to be watching any films of this type. And you probably don't. So you're just ridiculous.So yeah. Weak storyline, poor acting. Fairly usual for these types of films. But the naked girls were ugly.Ultimately, though, this film was worth at least one viewing, I'll give it that much. After that, well. Spank material if you like ugly girls, I guess."
1,Very poor book,Don't waste your money on this book. You can find all the information and a lot more readily on the web with little effort. Quite obvious the author spent very little time and effort putting this book together.
3,A promising poet ruined by a weighty topic.,"Rita Dove lacks the personal experience and linguistic adeptness to carry us effectively into the texture and atmosphere of Ms. Parks' harrowing and heroic quest. The effort is honorable, but the cult of celebrity has weakened the author's imagination and prosodic ambition."
1,A Commerical Work[.],"Here's a former poet, who has turned the corner -- producings works for mere commerical gain."
3,"Excellent product, but......","Excellent music, well worth the purchase. Great band and worth another album purchase. First copy was badly scratched, though not due to packaging or postal problems, and needed to be replaced. This was done with no quibbles at all, and arrived well before the due date. However, the replacement copy is of 'second' quality, but at least it plays without problems. Ergo: Service - first class, Delivery - first class, Quality - ?!"
3,Potential...but that's where it stops,Only a few good songs with Hangman being the absolute best on the cd...if they could have kept up the same driving force throughout the whole cd then maybe 4 or 5 stars..but nope..the majority is mediocre filler..beware.
5,Great Books,I love this author and cannot find much info on him. Does anyone know more about him or if he is still alive?
2,Bleed,"This movie was okay, it wasn't bad, but wasn't good either. Would I see the sequel, probably, but I don't know. Just don't watch it expecting the next Halloween or Friday the 13th. Oh yeah the killers costume is a ...[lot like the one] of Nature Trail to Hell!"
1,avoid!,"This is the stupidist, most low-budget fake-horror movie I have ever partially seen. There's no suspense or mystery, just a lot of sitting around naked. I couldn't even make it all the way through the movie much less halfway. We returned it that same day. Total disappointment. It's not what it seems and don't waste your time or even a penny. We now joke it's the worst movie we've ever rented tied w/ Garden of Evil."
1,Bleeding? More like crying with laughter!,"This movie might look like a pretty cool movie: a psyco killer with a cool-looking mask that obviously is going to try to kill people on the cover, right? RIGHT! It was all very predictable. Also, the killer has a pretty stupid motive of killing his victims. Besides, all of his victims were killed for no particurlar reason. The person who wrote this movie obviously just wanted to create a movie just for the heck of it. And to top that, the first 30 minutes of the movie is all the characters (guys and girls) come to a party, take off their clothes, and swim and guzzle boos. Can you say _______, becuase this movie doesn't even deserve insults."
3,Pretty good,"For a horror movie, I guess it wasn't as bad as it could have been. The filming quality was a little low in some scenes, and some dialogue didn't seem realistic, but other than that, this movie was a pretty good horror movie. There was a large amount of nudity,but most of it had nothing to do with the plot. There were a few funny lines here and there and a good plot twist at the end. I think the best part about this movie was the story, I don't think it's been done before."
1,"BLEED, big timewaster and just plain awful","Bleed (2002) Debbie Rochon, Danny Wolske, Allen Nabors, Orly Tepper, Ronnie Gene Blevins, Julie Strain, D: Devin Hamilton. After fish-out-of-water Rochon gets invited to her young boss's party, his circle of friends and him (around a hot tub) explain to her about their Murder Club. When she is convinced to join, she kills a woman, and it turns out there was no Murder Club, but a real killer does prowl in her path. Strikes a similitude to a college filmmaker's effort with shoddiness and common story; the suspense is traded in for repulsive splatter. Running Time: 82 minutes and rated R for strong violence, gore, sexuality, nudity, and language."
1,0 STARS SHOULD BE ENABLED,"This movie is so awful I can't even make it through it. The acting is worse than a Porky's film,mix that with annoying Blair Witch camera work and you have the trashy movie Bleed. A scream type clone that should be missed by all."
3,"Great b-movie horror, with lots of eye candy for both sexes","This horror flick's willingness to display, I would say, a good amount of male nudity is to be extremely commended and encouraged. I don't recall seeing a horror film ever that contained a slight majority of male nudity. I'd said it's about 55%/45% in favour of male nudity. It's hilarious to read all the male heterosexual protest on this page about the ""ungodly"" amount of male nudity in this film, in chat rooms, etc. You'd think men did 95% of the nudity. It goes to show you how uncomfortable straight men continue to be with having to view the male body as an erotic form. Most straight guys don't like to appreciate the male body in such lights - it makes them feel gay. The hetero male backlash to this film makes it and the male nudity in it all the more hotter."
4,The sniper game I've been waiting for.,"If sniping is one of your favorite things to do in a game, you gotta check this out. This third-person shooter is realistic, in that you must adjust your shots for wind, gravity, elevation, and must sometimes hold your breath to steady your aim. Also, you must pick your firing spot wisely, because once any enemy hears your rifle go off, you must either be in a well-fortified position or have a good escape root to relocate with.Replayability is good because there are so many levels and many different ways to traverse the terrain. You can stay out of sight, firing only when necessary, or run through with guns ablazing with the machine guns you pick up. There are also many fun bonus items like trip wire grenades (my personal favorite), time bombs, and hand grenades which you can use to devastate any enemies stalking you.So, if you are looking for a game that encourages you to think, strategize and move like a real WWII sniper, give this game a try!"
3,"ugh, you can't go back","Game might have been fine in it's day - but I wanted to try it since I just finished the XBOX 360 game. I guess you can't go back - graphics too poor compared to 360 HD to tolerate. I know this is a review looking back - so if you are like me, loved the 360 version, you might want to think twice before trying to go back to play the original."
2,Immune Power,"Dr. Kaiser's book presents information that has existed for many years prior to the onset of Human Immunodeficiency Virus. The book does a marginal job in reflecting information however, it lacks current research data to support his theoretical construct. The book does however, serve to provide a rudimentary understanding of pathologoical issues connected with the disease process. In my opinion, the book needs to be more centered on the psycholological issues that are as a direct result of multiple physiological problems associated with the disease process.In my opinon, readers should understand the author is a medical doctor and as such presents his information from a medical model and apparently lacks Clinical Psychological training in the field of Health Psychology to support his findings.David Wayne Doyle, II M.A.,LPC, CTADT,CCGCDoctoral Candidate-Clinical & Health Psychology"
5,Really Wonderful,"Love this CD, especially love the ballads she does. I've become such a huge fan of hers since buying this CD. Highly recommend if you enjoy jazzy, bluesy with some kick and funk."
5,Something To Remember,"Nikka Costa's ""Everybody Got Their Something"" came to be a sleeper hit with her hit ""Like A Feather"" and other hip beats such as ""Everybody Got Their Something"", but this CD's music is more heavily focused on dramatic vibes, with songs like ""Nothing"", ""So Have I For You"", and the knocker ""Corners Of Our Minds"". Her rythm and soul seems to leak in some songs a sense of rock, pop, and independancy, with a great feel for the 70's in them. Overall the songs are inventive in beat and rythm with techno vibes and out-of-this-world vocals. In the music world where everything seems fake, Nikka comes out standing different among the others. One of the most amazing albums I've ever witnessed."
4,Everybody has their something,"Wanna feel good...this song will make you beat your own beat. Absolutely worth a listening or 2 or 3 or 4, etc..."
5,"Nikka, where are you?",This album is one of my favorites...I also saw her live a couple of years back in Philly and it was one of the best shows I've seen... my question is what has happened to her? Her website says the last time she played out was in 2002...does anyone know whether she's making more music? It would be such a shame if she didn't!
2,So-so,"Bought the disc for the title song. There were only 1 or 2 others that were ok, but I found most of the songs just ordinary. Not an impressive album."
2,Nikka Costa,"I was looking for her CD, hoping that it will be like the song I loved as I was younger. Nikka Costa as a child singer is more my style than the R&B, soul etc. ""First Love"", her version of ""Through the eyes of Love"" and ""On my Own"" to say the few from 1980 s are more my style than this one. Sorry,Nikka. I am able to appreciate her vocal then than now."
5,"Very Special, Indeed.","There are so many fine things in this CD. Nikka uniquely combines Rock with R&B ...Black with White...as well as Pure Sex with Pure Class. The melodies and instrumentation are exciting, yet haunting. It is such a great combination of both ""old"" and ""new"". The use of subtle ""Stereo Effects"" alone should get an award. There are just no bad cuts on this CD.However, I fear that its commercial success may be limited by how much it is ahead of its time in the present institutionalized and brainwashed record industry.If you listen to this CD two or three times and still don't get the special vastness of Nikka's great Musical experience and range, then I really fell sorry for you.Even my kids (boys (6&8 yo) can&#65533;t wait to hear (and feel) this CD over and over. It just Rocks us in ten different directions every time we hear it. Is it possible to wear out a CD???"
3,"Not all funk, but not all over the place.","I really want to like this CD, but as others have said - it's not like the hit single ""Like a Feather"" In a way, that might be a good thing. Having the entire album with just looping groove tracks would get old fast. There's a few other songs that come close to getting funky, but not too much. A couple go on that cusp of ""I'm pop, but I'm doing this country - folk thing too"" which personally, I cn't stand one bit. The sad part is, she obviously has a range to go through many different styles. I only wish she had used more of that talent. Mixing in some 40's slow jazz into there and jumping across to techno or something. As it is, her album seems like Poe with a splash of funk."
2,nothing like I thought it would be,"i was expecting this album to be a lot funkier and spaced out than it was...She has a great voice...but the single ""like a feather"" misleads you to believe the rest of the album has that same deep soul/funk feel and it doesn't...too many slow tunes..not even that catchy im disappointed"
2,The backdrop for a better musician's album,"I was introduced to the music of Nikka Costa during the credits of the 2001 film, 'Blow.' The climactic and emotional ending of the film must have subdued my better judgement because I was left feeling that Nikka Costa was the undiscovered PJ Harvey or Tori Amos.However, now that I have listened to the CD twice, I'm not merely tired of it, but actually annoyed by it. The music is entirely unoriginal, the lyrics shallow and cliche, and the entire disk does almost nothing to stimulate my imagination.The music is so bland and repetative that I am left wondering if this disk isn't the background tracks from some unfinished composition by a real musician.There are some nice semi-nude pictures of the artist in the liner notes. I know that this is automatic redemption for any musical shortcomings in todays marketplace, but it's still not worth my money."
2,overrated,"apart from the unique feel of the first single, the album's a bit of a let down. her voice is pretty thin and not too interesting...the only time she stands out of the mix is when she's off-key. the poppy production doesn't help either."
5,Nikka funky? ... Nikka hot?,This album is probably my favorite so far for the year. I'm not much of a pop music fan. But this pop music is funky. I especially like the production of the album as a whole. I think itis great from start to finish even the Bizzare applause at end of the last track makes it worth the wait. I think anyone who can't appreciate the effort that was put into this project ought to have thier head examined(or thier soul). I hear she's been working with Prince. It's just a rumor.Who ever she teams up with I'm sure it will be just as good if not better than this one.
5,This needs to be your something!,"NIKKA ROCKS! Remember ""Like a Feather"" from the Tommy Commercial? This is the song! And she rocks it on all the songs, ""Everybody Got Their Something"", ""Push and Pull"", and ""Hope It Felt Good"" are all hot songs! The whole album is! GET IT NOW!"
3,Not as funky as I had hoped,"Based on the groove-laden percussion and disco-esque vocals of the first single, ""Like a Feather,"" I was really looking forward to a latter-day (female) Prince. But apart from the first track and a couple more of the up-tempo songs, much of the album sounds like a watered down version of DJ Rap or a strange mix of Lush and En Vogue. The lyrics get a little trite at times (""Well mama you can choose the rain but I choose the sun, that's all I need to free myself""), but it's not a bad listen since Costa manages to bring in a lot of noises and instruments without sounding cluttered. With a couple of exceptions that will make it onto my minidisc compilations, this is one of those albums I'll use for background music but won't think about too much."
5,Truly Infectious,"I had been hearing that song ""Everbody Got Their Something"" on the Desperate Housewives for the last year. Then I heard it again on an episode of Nip Tuck. I investigated..and I found a gem. This CD is TRULY infectious. Her voice, the lyrics, the music is all so beautifully put together. I can't believe a TRUE artist like Ms. Costa hasn't been recognized with mainstreem attention. I love this CD and i've only owned it for two hours now. The song ""So Have i for You"" gave me goosebumps the first time I heard it. Unbelievable!"
4,an unknown but glad I found her,I first discovered Nikka while watching Prince Live in Las Vegas on DVD. She just blew my mind!! Had to get whatever she had done. Very difficult to find her work however. Still trying to find Like a Feather even after a year of looking. Highly recommended.
4,nikka's awesome,"I have just recently heard nikka's song-""like a feather"" on the radio and i fell in love w/ her voice. It's so different and she looked amazing in her video. She has some serious...appeal like nothing ive ever seen and i don't mean to to sound like a lesbo either. I've also downloaded some of her songs...i love every song. Her beat is totally new and and will change hip-hop & ect. for ever. Lastly i just wanna say ...please go out and buy her cd ""everybody's got their something--cuz i am. i wanna see her hit the top over here in america...."
4,KNOW YOUR FUNK! NIkka owes it to the masters,"This is a good hook ladden funky record that is influenced by the great FUNK records of the seventies. If you listen to the title track ""Everybody got their something"", and then you listen to Sly and the Family Stone's ""If you want me to stay"" you will see what I'm talking about.To understand FUNK you need to know who the original masters are and buy their records. James Brown, Parliament, CYMANDE, Sly Stone, etc. I recommend that people who are reading this go buy two records. SLy Stone's Fresh and CYmande ""The soul of rasta"". [....]Then you will start to learn about the true FUNK masters! Nikka is to be commended for keeping the FUNK alive and kicking in the 2001. Peace and Funk."
4,Funk & Pop Got Married!!,"Indeed, funk and pop DID get married, and the offspring is called Nikka Costa. Blending pop lyric and funky beats, she has concocted a truly delightful album. Standouts on this album include ""Like A Feather"", the awesome title track, and ""Just Because"". The 2 interludes are kinda dumb, and the 5-minute blankness between the last song and the actual end of the album is pointless, but the rest is genius. Anybody who likes pop, funk, R&B, or good music is bound to like this. A true standout of 2001. ""Everybody Got Their Something"", and everybody's got to get this album!!"
4,"""jazz-funk meets hip-hop...Nikka Costa has spunk!""","Raised by her father Don Costa (composer/arranger), music is most certainly in her blood...this album shows what she's made of ~ ""Everybody Got Their Something"". Opening track starts off with a bang ""LIKE A FEATHER"", hard beat makes it difficult to sit still ~ ""EVERYBODY GOT THEIR SOMETHING"", funky arrangement...Nikki struts her stuff on this one, my personal favorite.Must mention the stand out ~ ""HOPE IT FELT GOOD"", hard-edge with deep funk and shades of rock blends well, sprinkles of soul is the final ingredient, her voice and style is complete and original.Hats off to ~ Justin Stanley and Mark Ronson (producers), Dominique Trenier (executive producers)...and to our hostess who shared and introduced us to one heck of a musical experience...co-producer and vocalist extraordinary ~ NIKKI COSTA!Total Time: 50:09 on 12 Tracks ~ Virgin Records 7243-10096-2-8 ~ (2001)"
3,Nothing spectacular. Not terrible either.,"Released in 1982, this time with 3 lead singers, Yolanda Rivera, Tito Ortiz and Tonito Ledee, La Sonora Poncena's ""Determination"" was somewhat of a letdown for me. It really lacks their old hard-hitting sound that made them famous in the first place. 'Joldo' is a nice instrumental track with a noticeable jazz influence, one of Lucca's musical preferences. But, if it weren't for their hit ""Yambeque"", I would have given this album a 2 star rating. The music on this album is not really bad, just sort of monotonous for me. I would recommend you rather get most and all of their early work which put them on the map, and for good reason. 3 star rating for Determination."
4,Determination,"This 1982 release by La Sonora Poncena is very good. Although it lacks the powerful sound that made them famous, there are still some hot tracks. Actually, all of the tracks are good. This famous Puerto Rican orquesta is one of the best, if not the BEST Puerto Rican salsa group there ever was. Yes, La Poncena beats El Gran Combo when it comes to authentic Puerto Rican salsa."
4,Good Learning Tool,The blanket is actually a lot smaller than I had hoped. Amazon should include the dimensions in the description.
3,Fantastic product!,"This was a great hit! Once we figured out how to get it to work, it was fantastic. I loved the way it did numbers when they were pressed upon, and saying the alphabet. I also liked the fact it was soft and the way it's designed gives you plenty of different things to work on learning.Negative is it's not loud enough, and the pressure points and the letters/numbers didn't align. It is also smaller than it appears in the picture."
1,Don't waste your money,How the heck do you wash this once your child spits up on it??? Which is the first and last time she played on it.
4,Live 101 Volume 1,"Good artists, intimate performances, although sound quality varies on a few songs. Worth picking up if you're a fan of 90's rock music."
3,Veronika Zemanova alert!,"This DVD features the amazing Veronika Zemanova, as well as Aria Giovani,Sunny Leone, Victoria Zdrok, and Stormy Daniels. Also in the cast are Swan,Dominique and Cherry Rain. Beautiful women, exotic costumes, exotic locations,strip to tease. If you're thinking explicit, LOOK ELSEWHERE.Each segment runs 4-5 minutes (Ms. Zemanova has two). If you want a cheapintroduction to some stunning women, this is it."
5,Easy to Read,I needed dice for our senior Bunco group. This larger dice is easy for them to handle and it is easy to read.
4,Sweet little cd,"A very bouncy, likeable cd of ukelele standards. Perfect tropical background music. Some very impressive ukulele work. I love Yellow Bird."
2,used sold as new,The unit works fine but the unit had been open and used .It sould have been sold as refurbishrd.I will keep it because it to much trouble to return.
1,garbage,"just garbage enough said , product wouldnt charge, cheaply Made trash , would refer this product to anyone , get a better one at your local walmart"
2,Portable PA System,"I really like this, but after 2 weeks, I charged it and it spoilt. I don't know why it suddenly spoilt..."
1,The worse pa system...,"Its of very poorer quality or lower standard...I don't know how come people have given it 5 star.I ordered the same system in past and i was not able to recognized my own voice.But recently reading good reviews, I thought I might have received defective one.But again same story.This time even the FM didn't work. The output doesn't seems to match even 40Watts and in description it says 80 watts.I didn't have good experience with any of Pyle systems so far.Thanks to Amazon for excellent return policy"
2,"Average product, received late","The product was average. Not fancy but good volume and easy to use. Some static when I talk. I received wrong item first, and the sellers customer service was not polite."
4,Great for networking meetings!!!,The system is lite weigh and easy to set up. I like that it does not have to be plugged in to work.
5,better than i had hoped for,"Amazing...Holds a charge forever, audio is clear, and you can hook up a portable device like a phone or mp3 player and play music loudly. Bought it for our wedding which is being held outdoors, sound carries well and loud for a great distance. cant wait to use it! the only minor issue is the cordless microphone has to be held very close to your mouth..i still love it!"
5,PYLE-PRO PWMA 100- Rechargeable Portable PA System,I gave three of these PA systems to my three granddaughters for Christmas and it was a big success. We heard singing all day long. The wireless mics worked great with the PA system. The sound was loud and clear. I would highly recommend this Portable PA System to anyone.
4,Tiny and efficient.,"Upon first opening you would think that you had bought a toy, however, once you get to using this product, it's good at what it does. For a small to medium room it projects."
4,Works for the price,"Ordered this to have at meetings when we don't want to pay for the hotel sound system. Haven't had any issues. Yeah, the look is a bit goofy, but that's ok. Didn't by it for the looks."
1,Sounds Horrible,"great machine if you don't plan on turning the volume past 1. If you do, get ready for distortion.Seems like a toy even tho it's pitched as a real PA system. boo!"
1,Need Tool To Open Multi-Tool,"I boiled it, oiled it, and STILL it's stiff and impossibly hard to open. I worked it about 30min. STILL really stiff. The same day I bought this I bought a Leatherman Surge and that one opens like a hot knife through butter.Disappointing."
5,Charge AL,"I got the new wave for my groomsmen last year and I thought those were great. Though they are similar, this Leatherman is much better! It is so light that you almost forget that you're wearing it. Since it is so light you may also forget that it is a pretty big tool with a lot of functionality. The Tin is the way to go, as you get the clip and lanyard attachments as well as some bits included. Great purchase, especially since it was a SD!"
2,Quality control issue !!!,I bought this Leatherman Charge AL to replace a Leatherman Blast that I lost. I thought I would upgrade to the more than double in price AL. BIG MISTAKE! I dont know if Leatherman dropped the ball in their QC department or if someone returned a used product to Amazon and they tried to pawn it off on me. The rivets holding the name plates on the handles were so loose they were pratically falling off. The main blade was not locking up properly. Fingerprints all over the tools like it had been used. I returned it immediatly. This is the first product from Amazon (and Leathermans) that I had a problem with. Buyer beware! Also the picture shows the premium nylon sheath ... yea... you dont get the sheath shown.
2,Used Product?,"I received this product on 11/30 and inspected it shortly afterward. I'm thinking someone actually bought this, used it and sent it back, and then was given to me. The leatherman looked dirty, there is what appears to be rust on the blade and wear on the file. Leatherman is a top quality product, so I'm disappointed on how this item arrived to me. I would send it back if I didn't need it so badly for some work I'm currently doing. Next time I buy a leatherman, I will not go through amazon."
1,Review of ligand,I was very unhappy with this product because it was unclear that this book was for a software program and has no value outside the software. I thought I was buying a textbook for data analysis and curve fitting for ligand binding but instead it was a useless software manual.
2,Read the original,"I found this book to be dull, preachy and boring. It was filled with ""conversations"" between people with various problems and Dr. Maxwell's suggested solutions.If you haven't read the original psycho-cybernetics, I would highly recommend that you read that first."
1,This novel is pure trash,"I am not a puritan, but this is the most disgusting piece of trash I have ever read. I have never read as many references to body parts and bodily functions as this. He mentions body parts hundreds of times in each chapter. Mr McKay is obsessive about genitals and feels that he must pass this on to the readers. I listened to the whole audio book hoping it would get better. It didn't. I threw it away. I have listened to hundreds of books and I have never thrown one out."
1,Clumsy first attempt,"I enjoyed the papercuts that I got from this novel more than the story itself. An attempt to be profound and sensual falls short, leaving the reader wondering why they dropped $20 on the hardcover edition. (oops)"
3,Tends to drag a bit,"Different from other suspense novels, but is a bit too long and can be rather boring at times. I was hoping for something similiar to the James Patterson books, but was disaapointed. Overall, not a horrible book, but not exactly what I was looking for."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"A mediocre story, poorly written and horribly read (by the author).The monotone of the reader is so bad that it takes a while to realize the shortcomings of the actual story. The characters are one-dimensional, and the items that might make them more interesting are only hinted at, never explored. There are far more well-written thrillers out there. Take the time to find one of them, and leave Toyer on the shelf."
2,The cover is better than the book!!!,"This book was written like it was a play. The story was not ""real"" at all. Maude, she was smart and then so dumb. The best part of the book is the last chapter, because you want to find out what is going to happen to Toyer. Telen, how can you fall in love with your X-lovers friend so quickly?? The books was just not believable."
3,mate a screen play with a suspense novel,"The positive editorial reviews of this novel just stunned me. The author uses improbable, almost silly issues to advance the plot. THe characters are empty shells rattling around on a set. I'm a fan of more intricately written books, (like every John Le Carre novel) and am severely tempted to quit this halfway through."
3,"BAD science and crazy women, but I loved the prose","The anatomical mistakes in this book really drive me bonkers. Come on, if you're going to cite a muscle by its proper name, at least get it right! The author seriously needed a reality check by a real doctor and a real cop on many aspects of the plot. I was also irritated by the otherwise brilliant doctor who followed terrible home defense advice given to her by a (dead) man, and then suddenly mimicked the other female characters by making utterly atrocious decisions. That said, I must admit I was hooked by the prose. It wasn't gramatically correct: Instead, it was a convincing, emotional stream of thought. Toyer is well worth reading if you can get past the glaring mistakes. I rated it as a 3 because I am notoriously geeky in that regard. Not-so-picky readers will like it more."
1,Aging writer has power fantasy!,"I really don't understand the rave reviews. If I want accurate reviews in the future I will come to amazon.com. How old and tired it is that women are always the victim. The women are all so stupid and brainless they have no clue they are being watched? No red flags go up when they are alone? They never carry a weapon, have no escape plan, no cell phone, no family or friends? Who was McKay's medical advisor? Geesh! Whenever a patient is totally comatose they need airway protection because they are unable to protect their own airway. You intubate them and place them on a ventilator. Strike one! The stereotyped classist relationship between a Dr. and nurse is too typical. A ""new nurse"" looks up to a female Dr. who displays compassion and caring, not a stuck up, rude female Dr. who is full of herself. Strike two! Choppy, predictable, boring. Strike three!There's more but I'm not going to waste my time."
3,A Distinct Line,"While engaging in Toyer's whimsical and enchanting details, I took special note of the tendency of the author to go off on long descriptions in italics. Beautiful writing skills and clever word choice, no doubt, but after a while he crosses that line between What is a Book, and What is a Reprint of a Screenplay.The opening is gorgeous with lyrical composition, and the first victim's scene is quite intriguing. Yet, it dies out shortly after that when finding out that this style of writing simply does not work when depicting such a griddy, physical novel. The mental perspectives are shallow and the characters are stereotyped (as they were meant to be I figure).Toyer ""toys"" with women. While some rape, beat, or murder females, Toyer prefers a more lasting, undeniably terrible method. The only problem is that this method ""sounds"" a lot better than it seems to ""read""."
5,Toyer was very intense and orginal.,I found Toyer to be very intense right from the beginging. The story takes off and does not stop until the very last page. Mr. McKay did his research. His involvement of his characters and content rival books writen By James Patterson. If you liked Kiss the Girls you will love this book.
3,Too many run-on sentences,"I, too, bought this book at The Dollar Store, but I'd been wanting to read it for a while. It was worth reading, but I couldn't get used the the run-on sentences!"
1,Complete Waste,"After 50 pages, I just skipped to the end, more in the hope the cat was unharmed than any of the characters. The plot was totally unbelievable, the writing was unprofessional, and the story was a joke. Newspaper articles about a serial maniac, who has already maimed 10 women appearing on page 3?? A DA who could care less? A doctor who foolishly allows a strange man access to her home, without any clue whatsoever that he might be stalking her? I could go on and on----bottom line: don't bother with this book. 2-9-02."
1,"Stupid, pretentious and a little sexist","Gardner McKay clearly wishes he was Thomas Harris or James Ellroy; he's ripped off both of them here pretty liberally. But since he writes like a 15-year-old and doesn't bother to do any sort of research (watching cheesy TV movies doesn't count), he won't ever come close. The plotting is thin, the characters thinner, and the dialogue is from Cliche-ville, USA. Writing a bad novel is one thing, writing one that is so blatantly mysoginistic is another. His main characters are females, and at first seem strong. But by the time that all of them have slept with a father figure and either gotten raped or very close to it, it's clear that his main joy is having his villain hurt women."
3,Give Away,"I cannot believe that Gail Johnson told who Toyer is in her review. I have read about half of the book and, although it may not be the best pyschological thriller I have ever read, I was having fun trying to guess who Toyer actually is. I am surprised that someone would give that away in a review. The book is enjoyable and a good weekend read."
1,Gardner McKay should stick to acting,"I read 50-60 books a year and at least 1/2 of them are mysteries or thrillers. One would hope that the action in this book would be impossible. I found it unbelievable! Mr. McKay seems to be trying to incorporate romance, murder, serial protanganists, Hollywood, medicine, etc. into one neat bundle and it's so far-fetched."
2,No Flow,"The early reviews of this book captured my interest, so I chanced it. Although the premise is interesting enough, the delivery just didn't do it for me. I found it to be too choppy even the way the chapters are constructed. Maybe it read more like a play than a novel. In any event, I just couldn't seem to get into the flow of the book and it seemed to take a long time to get through it."
3,An addictive page turner,"From the first incident in the book I felt I was hooked. The description of how Toyer ended up with the first victim in the book really bothered me. When a book can do that I know to read on. I found this book very different from most other psycho-thrillers that I have read. I found this one to be more believable. The characters were well-rounded and understandable. Toyer is a man not to be understood or trusted. A real page turner. It's quick sentences were the only thing that threw my off a bit on this book but, otherwise I thoroughly enjoyed it."
1,Yuck!,"After reading through the early reviews for this book I purchased the unabridged audiobook version thinking I'd be listening to a great story. Not! I found the book boring, hard to listen to, and very choppy. In fact, I gave up on the 3rd tape, and there are 5 more to go. I'll likely force myself to try and listen again -- since I spent my money on the darned tapes -- but it'll be a while."
2,I found the characters unbelievable,"Although at first it feels like a page-turner and reads like one, it is one of those novels that when you are done, you wonder why you wasted the time and effort. I found most of the characters to be gullible, beyond-stupid, and just plain crazy. One of the main characters, Maude, seemingly an intelligent doctor, was so unbelievable that her role in the end would have been laughable had it not been so ridiculous. Please tell me women are not this stupid."
2,Disappointed,Gardner McKay writes plays. This is what this material called a book truly is...a play. Short clipped sentences 453 pages long. By the middle of the book I couldn't wait for it to end.
3,A Ghoulish but Intriguing Story,"The premise behind this book is mind-boggling - a psychopath who doesn't kill, but rather leaves his victims in a state of physical perfection, while totally destroying their minds. This book had all the promise of a really compelling story. Unfortunately, many of the characters were at best irritating. Maud Garance, the psychiatrist who tries to help Toyer's victims, and one of the books main characters, was especially unpleasant. Actually, the one character who was fairly likeable was Toyer himself. The book was written in an almost subdued, languid style, which contrasted nicely with the gruesome subject matter. However, this languid style begins to drag towards the end of the book, and I found myself impatient for things to happen. All criticism aside, it was entertaining and unusual. Perhaps not one of the best I've read, but well worth the time spent reading."
1,This book is awful! YUCK!,"Gardner McKay might be a celebrated playwrite but boy can he NOT write a novel. The book begins on a very creepy and promising note, and then quickly degenerates into disjointed vignettes that have no flow whatsoever. The characters are one dimensional and moronic. Have you ever heard of caller id, stakeouts and FBI profiling Mr. McKay? Even the victims were unlikeable. When I was done I felt like I needed a very very long bath in some sort of disinfectant. I still feel kind of dirty and sick for even finishing it. Am I easily offended? Not at all --this was just a repulsive and disgusting book."
2,Not a REAL fur toy!!!,"I have a cat that is ONLY interested in playing with real fur toys, he won't touch a synthetic product, even if it is filled with catnip. I bought this based on the somewhat misleading statement that it was made with ""natural"" fur...I have no idea what that actually means, because the covering is most definitely not natural or real. So, I basically wasted over $6.00 on this toy due to the misleading statement. Don't buy it if you are looking for ""real fur"" toys."
1,"CHEAP, cats not even interested","These are terrible: poorly made rough fake fur, not even as pictured! My cats aren't even interested in these. Not worth the money at all. Even the packaging they came in was crappy. Save your money."
3,Sing more 3 Dog Night - like,"Chuck, with the Three Dog Night, sang tenor and baritone all in one song. Now he mainly sings tenor, almost soprano. I am sure he wants to steer from being viewed as being stuck in the past by changing his singing methods. But man...what made the Three Dog Night great is that they had 3 different singing styles. But...they had enough similarities to truly harmonize with each other. His background singers sound so much different from him that they are unable to harmonize with him. Chuck, love you man! But get back-up singers that you can harmonize with. Or have no back-up singers at all. Do more baritone or in between a tenor/baritone thing.Hope this review helps someone."
1,This is not an authentic CD,"Please, dear fans, if you look at the price of this CD...you should already be suspicious!!! Peter Noone himself has informed his fans that this is not-- I repeat NOT an authentic Herman's Hermits release. I suggest you investigate further down the list to EMI releases."
2,THIS CD BY MY JUDGEMENT CONTAINS REPERFORMANCES,"EVEN WITH THE SEVERE COMPRESSION OF REAL AUDIO (THE QUALITY OF A 29 DOLLAR BOOMBOX) I CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS ALBUM AND ""THEIR GREATEST HITS"" BOTH ALBUMS ARE BY HERMAN'S HERMITS! THE COVER ART PRESENTED BY (NO OFFENSE TO AMAZON.COM) FOR ""THEIR GREATEST HITS"" IS INCORRECT (IT BELONGS TO THIS ALBUM) I HAVE LISTENED TO ""Mrs.BROWN, YOU GOT A LOVELY DAUGHTER"" ON THIS ""GREATEST HITS"" AND ""THEIR GREATEST HITS"" AND ALSO LISTENED TO ""LISTEN PEOPLE"" ON THIS ALBUM AND ""JUST A LITTLE BIT BETTER"" (ON""THEIR GREATEST HITS"") AND FOUND THAT IF YOU WANT NEW STEREO RECORDINGS THEN BUY THIS ALBUM BUT IF YOU'RE A BABY BOOMER LIKE ME AND YOU WANT THE ORIGINAL MEMORIES THEN I RECOMMEND ""HERMAN'S HERMITS"" , ""THEIR GREATEST HITS""! PS LOOK FOR THE STORE ""LANGARRY ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY"" COING SOON FOR MORE DETAILS!"
1,Real Bull (rated -500).,"It's an ofense to the HH fans!. Herman's Hermits disbanded in the 70, and Peter Noone failed as a solo performer. Being old and gray, he re-joined the band and produced this trash. Sue Prime Cuts records if you want, or ask your money back (sorry Jeff , you should not be selling things like this!)."
1,Disappointing at best,"The lead singer on this CD is not Peter Noone, who was Herman of Herman's Hermits. He was the heart of their sound. Without him, the CD falls flat."
1,THIS IS NOT THE REAL PETER NOONE ON THIS CD!,I DO NOT LIKE TO SPEND MONEY ON CD'S THAT DO NOT HAVE THE PERSON ON IT THAT IT CLAIMS TO HAVE! PETER NOONE'S PICTURE IS ON THE FRONT AND THIS LEADS FANS TO BELIEVE IT'S HIS RECORDING.THIS SHOULD BE STOPPED NOW!!! THIS IS NOT FAIR TO MR. NOONE OR HIS FANS!
1,DON'T BUY THIS CD!,Don't buy this CD. It is NOT the original Hermit's Hermits and you will be very disappointed.
3,Interested but sadly disappointed,"For those of you that collect hard-to-find music or good music, I just have to tell you when I saw the track listing and the artists performing the songs I got excited. I thought it was a non-stop dance mix which these artist sound to be a good recipe for a great CD, right? Wrong! What this is just regular radio-versions which the listing doesn't tell you. I like a couple of songs here on this CD but that's it. If you don't mind just piling this CD with all the others you don't listen to that much, go ahead & buy it, otherwise pass on this one."
5,Racisim illuminated,"I remember when The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman first aired on broadcast television in 1973. I was a freshman in College and memories of civil unrest were still fresh in the minds of many Americans. Although the production gets off to a bit of a slow start with some stilted acting by a few of the actors, it soon warms up and becomes very real. Ms. Tyson gives one of the most moving and real performances that I've ever seen. I remember that the movie was shown in the evening and, as far as I know for the first time in TV history, the network received so many phone calls as a result of its showing that they pre-empted their programming the next day to show it again. It remains just as moving today. Once you start you will not want to pause or stop until the end credits are rolling up the screen. Incredible."
5,Takes you there...the dark years of our country,"A sad note to my first review...when the producers and crew were shooting ""The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman"" in the rural South one of the producers had to run with Ms. Tyson who, like her on-screen character Jane, was determined to maintain her lifestyle by going for a lengthy run in the predawn darkness in a section of the country that necessitated her needing an escort."
4,the autobiography of miss jane pittman,love this movie...it has been years since i have seen it. if you want some good history with a great story to watch then this is the one for you
3,Bad DVD transfer,"It is a pity that a powerful film like this one got such a terrible transfer.It has no subtitles in any language or even English close-captions, which could be very useful in certain scenes where the dialogue is hard to understand.I was lucky enough that two days after I viewed this DVD I was able to watch it on FLIX Cable Channel, and surprise! The print was far superior and it was close-captioned.Now, this 2 Disc Special Edition do offer a second Disc with very interesting interviews with author, screenwriter, director, producer and actors.These features alone worth the price of this edition.In spite of the poor transfer I very much enjoyed this movie."
5,The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,This is a wonderful movie too bad they do not make more movies like this one...I would recommend this movie as well as the book for anyones heart felt enjoyment !! I recieved this order on time as stated and securely packaged Thank you.
4,Woman with Courage,"This ""True to Life"" story should be read or seen (DVD), in EVERY SCHOOL in our Country from the earliest grades and up. Young people need to know that life is sometimes a struggle and doesn't always go our way. It takes effort, brains and Empathy, to be a good person in our Society. Everyone should learn about how hard life was for some people. This was a wonderful production of a difficult time in American History. The fact that Ms. Jane Pittman overcame such difficulties is inspirational."
5,The Auto Biography of Miss Jane Pittmen,"I had seen the made for t.v. version back in the seventy's and thought it was great. I resently was telling my niece about the story and she told me that she would love to read the book, so I purchased both the book and D.V.D. for her. She called me a few day's ago to tell me that she finished the book and can't wait to see the movie.Thank you Amazon.com I know where to look for hard to find idems.Elaine"
4,Excellent - but not for children,"I saw this originally when it was on TV. I don't see an age range listed, but I would make sure children don't slip into the room while watching it. I still have nightmares about the lynching scene. I think I was 10 or 12 at the time. It is an excellent story, just too much for kids to handle in parts."
3,Only 3/4 of the book,"A quick warning, while this is a good movie, it doesn't represent the entire book. It completely skips book three. This omission robs the story of its depth of insight into the human character. It's not a bad movie, but it completely softpedals the message Gaines wrote in the book."
4,That's MISS Jane to you.....,"I first saw this movie in the gymnasium of my elementary school years ago when it was probably just released! Wow! History revealed through the eyes of a 110 year-old woman who was born into slavery and lived to see the turbulent civil rights movement era. Standout performances by all. When I was younger, I used to think Miss Jane Pitman was not just a fictitious person! The only thing that keeps me from giving this dvd five stars is the picture and sound quality could have been improved. I still wouldn't let that deter anyone from purchasing this dvd. Watchable over and over again. I dare you not to get a little misty eyed in the final scene of this film!"
5,"Not Messiah on vocals, but still a masterpiece!","Released in 1992 this is my favorite album by the band, extremely underrated much to the fact that the much beloved Messiah Marcolin isn't handling the vocals. But replacement Tomas Vikström does a great job, he's got a more traditional metal way of singing than the operatic Messiah. The whole album is more traditional metal than the bands previous releases, it's not as slow and doomy as usual. But it's still the Candlemass trademark sound and the songwriting on this disc is exceptional. IMO this is the most consistent Candlemass disc ever. I ain't even gonna mention any songs because they're all top notch and if you like Candlemass or HEAVY metal this album won't disappoint!"
1,O my God !!! Do I really have to give it one star !,I have never heard such tosh in all my living life ! Can't work out if the 3 tracks are actually a tune of some sort or he is still tuning up ! If you buy this album don't forget to go to the local hardware store and buy some long rope and find a tree ! Swing Swing Swing......
1,An unemployed drunk who fooled a scientist,"Ted Serios was an out of work alcoholic who got scientists to give him unlimited supplies of Budweiser in exchange for psychic photos, which were produced by him looking at the camera through a small black tube. While he would rant and rave, working up an image, this tube would be substituted with one with a transparency in it and a small lens. Even after he was discredited and disappeared, and probably died, his photos sold for big money...."
4,Could not use Fireworks without this book,"Macromedia Fireworks is not an easy program to write a manual for. For example, its palettes are not labeled, many buttons are not labeled, and so forth. You have to click around to discover what functions certain screen artifacts serve. Given that, I respect anyone who can write a decent manual for it.I do *not* respect the documentation that shipped with the product. I simply could not accomplish anything in a short time by trying to use either the printed manuals or online help (which is *really* bad). In fact, I was resigned to the fact that Fireworks was not going to be useful for me.Fortunately, my wife had a copy of this book (and I have bought another copy too). After I followed some of its instructions, I actually began using Fireworks for a lot of my web graphics tasks. Had it not been for Sandee's book, I would have given up on Fireworks and gone back to using other software products."
2,not enough,"I've used the visual quickstart guides numerous times and have been very satisfied with them. This edition for Fireworks however, does not provide enough information. I appreciate not having to wade through lengthy discussions, but I do need enough to understand how to use the software, and this book does not provide it. I plan on returning mine, and spending a bit more money so that I can actually get something done with less time spent on trial and error of my own devising."
3,Just what it says,"This book is just what it claims to be, a quickstart guide. I have always found the VQS series to be very useful and economical, however they are really more reference books than instructional. I keep them sitting next to my mac for all those times I need to check up on a feature or remind myself of a key command. The Fireworks VQS fits right in. To the learn the program from scratch, look elsewhere."
4,Looking for a quick start with Fireworks?? This is the book,"My name is Johnathan Mark Smith I am a Webmaster and I also runthe Staten Island Macromedia User Group and I love this book. If you need to get a quick start with fireworks or need to find out how to do something, This is the book."
2,Whatever.,"First things first: Jimmy Eat World is one of the best bands on the planet, but this DVD is lame. It has the videos, but I've seen the videos on television. The performance of Get It Faster isn't really all that good at all. I've seen them play that song live twice and both times it was better than this one by a long shot. Given, Bleed American is not even worthy to be gauged on the same scale as Clarity, but even then, this thing isn't worth the 8 bucks you'll pay unless you're a stupid new fan who hasn't bothered to buy the older stuff. It's good to see that Jimmy Eat World hasn't lost it, as they've been playing more Clarity than anything else live lately and they aren't pleasing the 13 year old girls who want to hear The Middle over and over. Tom and Jim both looked totally bored playing it. Either way, for the real fans, the only incentive is the live audio-only of For Me This Is Heaven just because it's the best song ever. Don't buy this."
5,High recommended,"How anyone can say they were disappointed in this DVD EP is beyond me. It's live footage from two shows at the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C. It brings you the Jimmy Eat World live experience. You can feel the energy of the band and the excitement of the fans. It's an incredibly well done video. My friends and I have gone to many Jimmy shows and this video captures Jimmy Eat World live in its truest form. Yes, it did leave me wanting more -- which is the purpose of a good EP. If you were upset/angry that there wasn't more -- didn't the video serve its purpose in giving you a little taste; a ""teaser"", if you will? I highly recommend this DVD with reservation. Enjoy!"
3,jimmy eat world,"this dvd is alright. If you check this DVD out, it announces that the ""full"" length DVD will be out in February 2003. Its now July and there is still no full length dvd. I mean i know they're working on they're 5th LP. But at least give us something while we wait."
4,an ok buy for a fan,"the dvd was a great ""single"" and a teaser for the full length dvd ""believe in what you want"" that supposedly comes out in february of 2003. it wasn't worth the searching that i personally had to go through. if you are a big fan of jimmy eat world, i'd get it. a collecters item for all you collecters and a great filler if you have nothing else to do for about 15 minutes. i enjoyed it...but i wished the audio would've been live footage. i got bored just looking at my blank dvd screen."
3,Decent DVD,I liked it but I got a little bored. I always enjoy watching band DVDs though so I don't regret buying.
1,Cheapo,"This toy was fun for about 2 tries, then it literally ""exploded"" by falling apart. I am disappointed in the quality."
5,Great Soundtrack,this is a great soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this cd are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
3,Great Atmosphere But Not Much Of a Story,"The setting is Algeria and France during the political upheavals of the late 1950's. A young Algerian begins boxing and rises through the ranks to become the French National Champion. He is caught in a political tug of war between the French authorities and Algerian revolutionaries. This is a great idea for a story but the Bande Desinee format is not best medium for telling it. Baru's artwork is beautiful and rich in the atmosphere of the time. Unforutnately, the text is more of an outline of a good story than it is a real story."
1,Under the bottom of the barrel.,"It's rare to find a movie with no redeeming qualities on any level, but this one fits the bill. Imagine some guys from the local community college, who spend a little too much time playing role-playing games, borrowing someone's dad's camcorder and making a movie in the local park during their days off from Wal-Mart. That should give you an idea of what you're in for here. These boys obviously have dirty minds worthy of any 13 year-old boy, but they couldn't even find any girls willing to take their tops off and provide a little prurient interest. The best thing about ""Quest for the Egg Salad"" is its running time: 60 minutes. Just remember, you've been warned."
2,A few good ideas buried among a lot of schlock,"I have to disagree with the reviewer who said the gift ideas were ""tacky."" ""Corny"" is the word I would've used. Virtually every idea in this book involves including a note with a bad pun with your gift. That would be OK, if the note were optional. The problem is, most of the gifts don't make sense without the note. If you leave out the silly note that says, ""Sorry I've been driving you nuts,"" just imagine the confused look on the face of the person to whom you just gave a bag of mixed nuts.There are a few genuinely good ideas here, but not enough to make the book worth the price, or to justify having it take up valuable bookshelf space. I'd advise checking it out of the library, sneaking a peek at the local bookstore, or as a last resort, buying it used."
3,disappointed,I was expecting ideas for my child's teachers.I couldn't find any. There are some ideas for others but they are not what I expected I guess.
1,Book Was That Bad,"My Daughter's Boyfriend by Cydney Rax has set African-American literature back by about 20 years. Cydney's subject matter and writing style is down right vulgar and ignorant! I cannot believe that this book even got published let alone had the audacity to grace the stands of my local book store. This woman should be tarred and feathered for writing such a poor imitation of prose that tries to pass as literature. She should have asked permission before writing this book and been denied. Cydney Rax, it's time to go back to the drawing board."
2,Corny!,"I am sorry, but this book was BORING, slow moving, and straight up fiction! The tone/voice was dry, the author told a cautious ineffective story, that could have been a pageturner. I agree, one star for courage and one star for effort. This review is by no means a bash to the author, it is purely based on MDB. Perhaps the author will show growth on her next effort.-2"
3,Unacceptable Actions!,This was just not acceptable. Being attracted to your daughter's boyfriend and then acting on the attraction is awful. Tracey should have just sat her daughter down and let her know she and the boyfriend had this attraction for one another and then maybe a lot of the drama could have been prevented. Now there's room for the daughter to want one of the momma's future men as payback.
2,In my own words..,"When I first bought this book, I thought ""hmm, interesting title,"" but as I read it, I began to realize how completely stupid Tracey Davenport was! She had no self-esteem, self-respect or any regard for her only child! I usually write very positive reviews, but this book baffled me. Cyndey, you're a good author, but I think a lot could be said in this book, with less words...it was a bit long and drawn out. I feel that Lauren should have been more upset than she was; hey, her mother can learn from her, Lauren was an extraordinary child. This novel had parents acting like they'd lost their minds and the children had the common sense! What gives??? Oh well, enough of my ranting and raving; I know it was your first, Cyndey and I'm sure others will be better; keep on doing your thing."
1,thank God I didn't buy this,"This book was given to me as a gift, what a waste. It was not worth the money spent on it! I tried to force myself to read this mess, but had to stop in the middle of the book. CYDNEY RAX please get some better ideas for your next book and leave the unnessary scenes out of it."
5,My Daughter's Boyfriend,"Some novels arouse reader interest just from the premise. Rax's debut entry is such a novel. Consider the scenario. A single mother, Tracey Davenport, who'd had her now seventeen-year old daughter, Lauren, when she herself was seventeen, finds herself greatly attracted to her daughter's college age boyfriend. Hott, with two t's and a capital H. In the wrong hands this story could have been pages of melodrama and soap opera styling instead of the hard-hitting tale that Rax presented. Her assured writing style and unique voice is a welcome addition to the canon of African-Amercian contemporary fiction. Rax offers a story with versimillitude and insights about various issues. The relationship between mothers and daughters. The challenges of parenting. Dilemmas in romantic relationships. Love versus lust. Excellent novel."
3,Interesting...,"The title definitely caught my interest. The book was a pretty good read for most of it. The end left a lot to be desired. I expected something better.There's no way I believe that Lauren would react that way to Aaron after the whole thing blew up and she hadn't seen him in a while.I think the Lauren and Brad ""thing"" ended too abruptly.I was disappointed at the way the book ended. I thought there could have been more of a reaction from Lauren, and Aaron for that matter.I'm looking forward to reading ""My husband's Girlfriend""."
3,Okay,"I am a very avid-reader. I love ghetto-fabulous books! When I first read everyone else's review for this book i could have sworn this was going to be the worst book possible. It turns out it wasn't, you have to give it a chance. The mother is a very naive woman and she makes stupid choices but all in all the book turned out to be a lesson learned for everyone."
5,Controversial and Real,"First of all, I have to say I'm surprised by so many people saying a mother wouldn't do this (sleep with her daughter's boyfriend). I would say most mothers wouldn't dream of doing this but I'm willing to wager this has happened numerous times. We read all the time about some mother who has severely abused or killed their child so a mother sleeping with her daughter's boyfriend isn't a big leap in today's world. Besides, I've seen first hand quite a few younger mothers anxious to recapture their youth, dressing like their teenage daughters and appear to be in competition with them. No one is going to tell me none of these mothers have crossed that line in hopes of feeling more desired than their daughter. Hey, it's sick, it's disgusting and a damn shame, but it happens.Cydney, kudos to you for doing an excellent job at tackling such a controversial storyline."
4,My Daughter's Boyfriend,"I disagree with some of the reviews that shot this book down. I viewed it as unpretentious. I believe that the author was straight to the point with the story line. Whether we would like to admit it or not this situation is real and sometimes real life lack ""depth"". I know a friend who dealt with this situation and it was almost like reading her story. I really enjoyed reading it."
2,not one i liked,"i assume this book is aimed at 16-24 bracket, i fall into thisi brought this book about 8months ago, im half way though, i can not bring myself to finish it."
2,She was wrong for that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is about a mother, daughter, and a boyfriend. Tracy has a seventeen year old daughter that she has been preaching to forever and a day about not becoming a statistic and trashing her future by becoming a teen mom. Tracey is preaching but she sure ain't practicing it. She gets dumped and her self-esteem is so low that she slithers down and steals her daughter's boyfriend. Just plain unforgiveably trifling. I was very disappointed with the book, but I'm really not too surprised especially with the title and the subject. Can you say ""My mom's a Ho?"""
2,Rewrite the Manuscript,"I thought I was about to read something good. Instead, I read something long, boring and redundant. Don't bother with this one. Instead, read THE HOTTEST SUMMER EVER KNOWN. It's a hot new urban tale that'll have you on the edge of your seat."
2,Horrible....,"This book was absolutely terrible. The plot was ok and kept my glued to the book but the situations were too unbelievable. Why would a mother do this to her daughter and then after the daughter finds out she keeps doing it? She's more concerned with her own lust for this boy then about her daughter? The sex scenes were explicit but I couldn't wrap my imagination around them. There were too many characters and too much unneccesary dialouge. The author was trying too hard at times. At one point in the book I thought the mother was pregnant but the book didn't hold my attention enough for me to actually find out. The ending was terrible right along with the rest of the book. I'm a avid reader and gives respect when respect is due but this was a terrible novel, a waste of money and time. I won't be buying another novel from this author."
5,Family Comes First,"This was a very related-life novel. That should alert all females things happens for unknown reasons. Of course, we have the power to control these buttons on/off switches.However, what's in the dark will comes to light. Always family bond should comes first.Prayer changes all things.Consequently, it was a very good novel that should keep you focused on your surroundings."
3,Bizarre,"Okay, this is NOT going to be a bashing. I will say that the book is very bizarre....I mean, just the subject matter is disturbing, but for the most peculiar reason, I actually ENJOYED the book. It took me awhile to adjuct topic b/c it really annoyed me. How a mother, who is supposed to be loving and only want the best for their children, but Tracey was on some other stuff. She completely abandoned being a mother, and being there for her daughter. I can only imagine the hurt I would feel if this happened between me and my mother. But the story just keeps moving and gets that much more interesting. You actually come to show compassion for Tracey and Aaron, they become less evil and I could sympathize. I think Tracey needed that period w/Aaron to help her see the big picture. Overall, I would recommend this book, it is a good read."
4,Passion beyond Passion,My Daugher's Boyfriend is a novel that tells of a mother's betrayal towards her 17 year-old daughter that reaches a forbidden climax that nobody should want to experience that has any morals. When I finished reading this book I was looking for a suggestion list of recommendations for self-help groups or counseling services.
1,STRAIGHT UP GARBAGE,I previously reviewed this book and my review is not showing on my page for some reason. Maybe because I cursed a little because this garbage had me hot. I have never read such a classless book like this. No mother in their right mind would hurt their only daughter that way. I couldn't get into this book no matter how hard I tried. Don't patronize this crap. This book is not worth the paper it was wrote on.
4,IMPRESSIVE,"Being a fan of gospel rap music I was very interested in picking up somethin new. I have heard of these guys from Groovesound Records for a while now, and was exited to hear this cd. The opening song on this compilation is explosive, it gives you the feel that this is more of an album than a compilation. The intro leads into the second song with one of the nicest transitions I have heard. Songs that stand out on this album are Swirven by Streetype, and the last track which has everyone that was on the album perform together. The only flip side is it is could of had more tracks, and if your not a fan of dance music there are two songs on there that you might want to pass. But overall this is definately the best gospel rap compilation I have ever heard."
3,This is a mixed bag,"The book has some great ideas for how to lower your monthly expenses on things such as insurance and taxes.However, contrary to what several said below, the money movement strategy is pretty much a sham. Several below seemed to point out the MMS would have gotten you out of the market around the beginning of 2000 which is true. However, the MMS would have put you back in the market on February 2001 (when the prime rate dropped below 9%) and kept you there for the stock market blood-letting that occurred all the way to the end of 2002. Even to this day, the market has yet to recover back above February 2001 levels, so from February 2001-Today, a MMS person would have a losing portfolio for 4+ years now."
4,"Money Movement Strategy, use your head!","Keep in mind that this great book by Mr. Givens was written back in 1995. In reference to the money movement strategy, interest rates were a lot higher back then so information in the book may not necessarily apply to todays economy.On the other hand, Givens Money Movement Strategy still works if you use your head and adjust it for the times. For example, I am using the money movement stategy now and back in January began moving out of stocks into bonds and cash. Why? Interest rates were rising. Mr. Givens mantra always was:""When interest rates are going up, stocks go down. When interest rates are going down, stocks go up.""Use the money movement strategy but use your head. Also use Mr. Givens other mutual fund advice, use no load funds only and stay away from funds with a large cap. Lastly, ignore those commissioned sales people who want to sell you loaded mutual funds with expenses or individual stocks."
5,"SENSATIONAL! I GOT BACK $1,480 IN ONE DAY!","After reading More Wealth Without Risk I went out immediately and began applying the strategies---the very first was to cancel credit life and extended warranty on my automobile. Result? I got back a whopping $1,480 in one day! That's money that is targeted for a much better use than making my bank and automobile dealer richer.I also went over my prior three years tax returns, filed amended returns using the GIVENS STRATEGIES and got back over $3,500! This was money sitting in the closet that I never would have known about if it wasn't for MORE WEALTH WITHOUT RISK!So thank you Mr Givens for a sensational book. I can't wait to see my results when I start to apply more of the strategies."
5,"Mr Givens has helped me! You never know, so read it!","I was 24 and alone when I inherited my family's $$$, three properties and an auto. As a young lady without a clue to money, legal, insurance and investing matters, I read Given's first book and did my homework as he instructed. I then shocked the pants off my insurance and real estate agents, investment bankers and attorney. More than one of these professionals commented, ""You've been reading up on this haven't you"". Because they could see I came informed. I never disclosed my source to anyone and the test was time, to see if I had made the right choices following Givens' book. I assume it still depends on everyone's situation, but it gave me a smart start to hold onto what I had, not waist it and gain with it!I'm now 33 and have never taken a pitfall because of Givens' advise, but have saved a lot of money and gained a lot of good knowledge to guide me. IT'S WORTH A READ IN MY OPINION"
5,"Turned 5 thousand in $80,000 in 9 years","I rolled over some money into a self directed IRA using Givens' strategies. I began with 5k in 1990. My account is now close to 80k, and all I did was do what the book said. Take it or leave it, this is the BEST book on personal finance there is in my humble opinion. I would recommend 15 stars on a scale of 1 to 5. The best part of the book is where he teaches you how to make money using Mutual Funds NO MATTER WHAT THE US ECONOMY IS DOING and yes folks that means INFLATION, DEFLATION, STAGFLATION, RECESSION, OPPRESSION, REGRESSION....in other words, in good times and in bad. Well worth your time to read this little jewel of a book."
2,Advice from a ghost,"Don't the reader/reviewers of this book realize that Charles Givens settled numerous fraud lawsuits against him and his orginization in the early 1990's? And, oh yeah.....he died in 1998, three years before the book came out. This is just his family/publishers cashing in on outdated advice."
1,(More)Wealth Without Risk,"I am not too happy with my order. I ordered the book ""Wealth Without Risk"" (dealing with tax lein certificates and I received the unwanted, unrequested ""More Wealth Without Risk"". I have no use for this book and I wanted the prior aforementioned book. Someone at your picking department picked the wrong book.I am very disappointed. Please see what you can do to rectify this error. Thank you. - Jose"
1,Don't waste your time or money on this book.,"Wonder why Givens has dropped off the financial planning radar screen? Take a look in Personal Finance for Dummies by Eric Tyson and see. On page 15 he says, ""Thousands of people went to seminars conducted by Givens...as has been well documented by now, many unsuspecting investors were sold commission-laden products, including risky limited partnerships, through his organization"".Do a search of the web....No Charles Givens or his organization. Wonder where he went to.The book is full of schemes that don't work. Take for example his statement about not buying disability insurance unless your sick or accident prone. Well, Chuck...want to hand me the crystal ball so I can see my future. This one scheme can lead someone quickly into financial ruin.Don't waste your money or your time on this or any of his other books. I wonder who all of these folks that gave him 5 star book reviews work. Are they friends or suckers of yours, Chuck?"
5,A wealth of advice that will save you money!,"This book offers a wealth of well-thought out advice about money. It reads easily and goes straight to the point. Highly recommended for anybody interested in acquiring wealth without risk, particularly if you reside in the U.S., since a fair amount of the advice is U.S.-centric."
5,it is a great quality and fun,"the bag is a nice feature but it does get beat up rather fast...the bocce set comes with a measuring device, and score counter... which was nice. the balls are high quality and symmetrical.Its a nice family set... If you can get it with free shipping worth it because it is a heavy item."
4,mostly slate,"this book is almost entirely about slate sculpture which is really more like relief drawings. the slate he uses is blackboard slate and only about 1/4"" thick so the book is equal parts line drawings and then how they look in slate, slightly modeled. there is a brief discussion of alabaster and other soft stones but little to none on sculpture in the round. interesting fact: the author created the Heisman trophy."
3,A good reference guide,As the name implies- Harper's Encyclopedia of Mystical & Paranormal is just that- all entries are comprehensive and presented in a textbook format. This could be a valuable research tool- entertainment value is somehow on the low end- but it (somehow) makes up for it for the well researched entries as well as the unbiased discussion of the Mystical and paranormal.
4,A CATCHY HOOK-FILLED 2nd CD....BRING BACK THE 1980's,"Its Fun to Play SPOT THE INFLUENCE with this Charming 'lil disc. Echoes of Crowded House, U2,and Talking Heads run rampant thru RAZORLIGHT's 2nd CD. If it wasnt for a bit of OASIS edge to the tunes, one might sware GRUNGE and 1990's rock never existed. Only one or two songs from their first disc jumped out at me, but every track's a killer here. If some Hipper-than-Thou Teen Angst TV Show does'nt pick up the track AMERICA here for their new theme song they're crazy (see ABC-TV's JERICHO or THE OC?...Producers/Music Supervisors....Are You Listening?....AMERICA is every bit the winner CLOSER TO FREE was for Party Of Five or I'LL REMEBER YOU was for Friends). A solid Pop Rock release I'll be listening to long after Ive sold my RACONTEURS and YEAH YEAH YEAH discs"
3,"good, not great.","Q magazine selected this as the 3rd best album of 2006! 3rd! what's going on there? this is a good album, a catchy selection of songs at the crossroads of power pop and rock and roll, but no way is this a great album! 3rd best of the year! who is doing what to whom over at that publication? i don't mean to rip this thing, like i said: it's a good enough album, just way over-rated in some circles."
2,"Good read, if you are just starting out","I got this book after reading several people mention it on various websites. I don't consider myself an expert by any stretch of the imagination but I have spent a ridiculous amount of time online looking into various ttc topics. I decided to buy this book and see if perhaps there was a great wealth of information hiding in its pages but sadly the information here was nothing new to me. It was helpful in having a lot of the information in one place, if I needed to look up something or re-read something of interest. I was disappointed because after reading the book I was left with more questions and feeling more confused and overwhelmed. I went so far as to log into the website listed with the book but didn't get much help there either. Basically, I would recommend this book to someone just getting started on their ttc journey or someone that doesn't pour over internet sites all night! :) Good luck!!"
5,Should be Mandatory Reading,"I feel this book should be on the ""mandatory reading"" list for all women - especially young women. Our society and most of our mothers have wholly failed at teaching us about this sacred subject! Whether you are trying to get pregnant, trying to prevent pregnancy, or neither of the above, this is a must read. I would add, that there is a lot of information in this book that men should know too."
5,Life changing!,"One of the best books in my library. I'm studying to be a midwife, and tcoyf gave me insight I haven't gotten anywhere else. I LOVE IT, and am now an active charter with a blog specifically about reproductive health. MUST HAVE for all women."
5,Taking Charge is a great book!,"I ordered this book after it was recommended to me as my husband and I are trying for baby #2. I am not a usually reader, but I read the entire book in a weekend. I thought she had some great information about all that really is going on in our bodies. I have only had the book a few weeks, so we haven't been able to achieve pregnancy yet, but I am confident I will be a better-educated woman from now on! Really great info if you want to achieve pregnancy or avoid it. I think the book discredits doctors somewhat, but if you are more educated about your own body, you won't be as likely to go see a doctor unless something is majorly out of the ordinary."
5,Must have for couples trying to conceive!!,I can't believe how much I learned about my body from reading this book! There are things about a woman's cycle that you would never ever learn anywhere else! I have successfully conceived twice (both times within just a couple months of trying) with the method I learned in this book. Amazing information - you have to get this book if you're trying to conceive and want to feel more in control of the process! Highly recommend!
5,I love this book!,"I would recommend this book to anyone who is trying to conceive or not! This book has simple wisdom and methods to be able to understand your cycles, regardless of what stage of life you are in!"
5,Life-changing book,"This book tells you everything you should know about your body but were never taught. It was amazingly eye-opening. I read it months ago, and still can't believe how much I learned. Also, I read it before trying to get pregnant, and even though I'm 35, got pregnant the first month I charted. It may seem like trouble to chart, but in reality it is SO cool to see your body doing just what it is supposed to do, and giving you so many signs of its goings-on. It's a great feeling when you think you ovulated and your temperature the next morning confirms it. Get this book if you are trying to get pregnant, trying not to get pregnant, or just want to know all there is to know about your own amazing body."
1,"Encyclopedia width !,",This book is like an encyclopedia for doctors. Way too big with unnecessary terms and info. Didnt finish reading... Kinda lost interest along the way. Wasn't a fun book to read :(
3,Just ok.,"Hi people, from all over the world.Let me tell this book is huge, have million of pages, from which I just read half because, when get to the center of the book, then the author star to repeat everything that was sayd on previous chapters. Yes, It help me a lot to understand my body and my reproductive system, but i think there is too much stuff repeated. I finished the book just when I arrived to exactly the center of it. I think the author should resume ..."
3,great informative book,great book. bought 'slight used' and was disappointed to find all the template charts filled in with the prior owners personal info. was a bummer because these templates were one of the main reasons i had purchased the book.
3,"The Right Science, but the Wrong Perspective","It is exciting that an apparent feminist would support the counter-cultural idea that natural family planning is just as EFFECTIVE and HEALTHIER than artificial birth control. Since most health care professionals still know little about this method, and tend to lump it in with the ineffective ""rhythm method"" of the past, this book might serve well in the medical community as an introduction to natural family planning. However, the downfall of the book is that it still clings to the idea of the ""birth control culture"" that fertility is something to be CONTROLLED. This ""take control"" perspective will not likely appeal to couples who would like to practice natural family planning for religious or moral reasons; such couples will find much better guidance in ""The Art of Natural Family Planning"" by John and Sheila K. Kippley; here they will get all of the same scientific methodology without the feminist rhetoric."
1,Doesn't Always Work,"I followed this book's advice for over a year, and nothing happened. Then, I read ""What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant"" by Dr. Daniel Potter, and learned I had been wasting my time.I'm now starting an IVF program, and Dr. Potter's book is helping me through the whole process. If you haven't bought this one yet, you may want to check it out."
3,Pleased with the book not the condition,"The book came quickly and it is great! I ordered a used copy, I have done that before and was happy with it. But with this book, I was disappointed in it's condition. The binding was weak with the back cover half torn off. The pages are yellowish and kind of smell like old old library book. But the quick shipping and content of the book I was happy with."
2,Why do people find this so helpful? I didn't...,"To me, it seemed virtually this entire book talked about CM! There's a lot more to understanding fertility than just knowing your CM!!!! :("
2,"Can get info elsewhere, commentary is annoying","I bought this based on all the recommendations here on amazon, and was disappointed. I had already read most of this content elsewhere, so I didn't learn very much. Not only that, I found it to be preach-y and annoyingly full of anecdotes about how doctors never listen to the author. Clearly she has struggled to get her message across, and I appreciate her efforts and believe in the message, but its not supposed to be an autobiography. I wish I'd read an excerpt before buying. Also the CD included is the same software that you can download for free online, and the actual charting service associated with this book is not free (as opposed to several other websites which are free)."
5,The instruction book for the female body.,"This book should be handed to girls at age 13 as an instruction booklet to their body.With topics WAY beyond fertility, this book covers everything women need to know about their body.With so many women thinking their body is 'dirty' and such, this book is so much more educating and informative than any I have ever even heard of.Buy this book."
5,don't be overwhelmed by the number of pages,"when I first saw this book was like 500 pages I was a little overwhelmed, but soon realized if you use the book for birth control only the first 125 pages apply. If using it for pregnancy achievement there's about another 30 pages. But it's an easy read, very informative and even humourous at times. Most of the back third if the book is worksheets and appendix. Get the book, use it-it works! Understanding all the mysteries of our crazy cycles is wonderfully freeing and interesting!"
5,Love the book,"I loved reading the book. It was very well written, easy to follow and understand. It gave me the knowledge of knowing my body exactly."
5,Wonderful Book,I love this book. It taught me so much about my body and how to interpret the signals that it sends me every day. I actually bought this copy for my sister and she loved it as well!
4,Lots of information,I am past 35 and wanted to make sure that I gave myself the best chance of getting pregnant quickly. Straightforward and useful information. Just received it a month ago and we will see what happens
5,Amazing book every woman should have,what the title says. explains everything going on with your body in a very easy way! i recommend this book for every woman.
5,A must read,"This book is a must read for any women. After having tried to get pregnant for 4 months I was getting very frustrated. I was told to purchase this book and it would help. They were right. There was so much I thought I knew but this book explained so much more. After taking what I learned from the book, we were pregnant in 2 months. Very glad I purchased it."
4,Very Informational,This book will tell you more in a more concise way than reading all over the net. Even my husband liked it.
5,Must have for anyone trying to have a baby,"This book is a must have for women who want to have a child and don't want to wait for it to ""just happen"". I used this book to conceive our first child. Within three months of charting I knew I was pregnant. By following the methods in this book I didn't take a pregnancy test, just charting my temperature for 30 days was enough. This book brought about such an empowering sense over my cycle; I highly recommend it to those who want to get pregnant and those women who don't. Even though I didn't chart for my second pregnancy I was fully aware of when I was ovulating and conceived with no issues. Great book!!!!"
5,"This really, really works - buy it!","After ""trying"" for over a year (or what we thought was trying) my husband and I were quite frustrated. Like most women, I was taught that a typical cycle is 28 days long, with ovulation occurring on the 14th day. I consider myself to be an educated woman, (advanced degrees and all!) yet, upon reading this book, I was shocked to discover that I knew absolutely NOTHING about my own body. Nothing. Zip. Zilch. It's been a true eye-opener for us. I'm so happy to say that, after just 30 days of writing down my temperature each morning and tracking my body's ""clues,"" we're pregnant! This book was amazingly well-written, easy to undertand, and detailed. Most of all, it honestly worked for us."
5,very good book,This book is very informative. I did not learn all the things she teaches you about your body. It is also good if you are Catholic since she talks about family planning.
5,This book changed my life!,Every woman should read this book. It changed my life it will change yours. I wish this information was taught in school thank goodness you can read this book!
2,A better book is The Art of Natural Family Planning,"This book uses the concept of Natural Family Planning, but calls it a different name. It gives instruction on how to use the Natural Family Planning method but doesn't explain how this protects the sacredness of life. I highly suggest that you buy the book by Kippley titled Natural Family Planning instead. Kippley's book addresses the sacredness of human life and how that affects the way we treat our bodies. It is a great book for all couples."
1,Wasn't informed pages were ripped out,Title says it all. I would have given more stars if this hadnt pi**ed me off so much. The charts in the back are really important to using the book. I would have been better off going to my local bookstore and buying a new copy. >:(
2,MUST READ,"Hi! I did not read this book yet but my close friend Brandy said that THIS BOOK IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST READ!I have a baby now who is 6 months old and the method described in this book looks very interesting. Also, sounds like a hilarious read with some good facts about understanding your body. Nothing like a book with some good humor in it.PS- Brandy is pregnant!"
5,This needs to be read by all women everywhere!,"This is probably the most life changing book I've ever read. I wish in school as young girls we had known exactly what our body does at menstruation and ovulation. It's amazing.Not only can this be used for TTC - it can be used to learn how to better utilize birth control methods. Being aware of your basal body temp & cervical fluid you actually know when you are ovulating and when your period is due. Like clockwork!In addition, having your temps stay high instead of dipping down as your period approaches is indicative of pregnancy achievement. In my case this happened, (preg test to confirm) but unfortunately I wasn't able to hold the pregnancy and my temps started to go downwards -- making my period a couple of days late. If I hadn't have been charting, I would've never known I was pregnant, and just chalked it up to a late period.This book is good for all women - empowering them to learn more about their amazing bodies!"
3,A Female Necessity,"The author reiterates herself a lot in this book, which is why I gave it 3 stars. Other than that, it is a really awesome reference, learning, and teaching tool for women to learn how their bodies work. This is definitely something every mom should share with her older-adolescent daughters. Worth the money."
4,Fertility...not Infertility,"This book has objective information about a woman's reproductive system; much of which I wish I'd known when I was 17. The fertility information is simply explained; I'm not sure if it's the entire picture, though. For people like me who are in the midst of TTC, the information can be misleading or anxiety-producing. There is some basic information about infertility, but, as many people know, there is not much about infertility that can be controlled by reading a book."
3,Did not find this book as helpful as others...,"Although the information in this book is extremely sound medical advice and very helpful in trying to understand your fertility and body, I did not find it as helpful as many others. The temperature taking and charting was extremely time-consuming and fluctuated wildly from the way the text explains it should, not making it a great method for me. If you are very interested in taking the time this book requires and have the patience, it will surely be a great book for you. If you do not have either (that was me!), then you may get more value from ""The Fastest Way to Get Pregnant Naturally"" by Dr. Christopher Williams. It has no-nonsense advice as well but emphasizes utilizing modern techology in your quest for children in conjunction with your body's signals. I found it extremely helpful...Good luck with your baby adventures!!!"
5,A book every woman should read,My gynecologist recommended me this book as a contraception method.... but I am amazed how I've been living all this years without knowing all what happend in my own body. Great book!
5,A must read for ALL women,This is one of the most informative books I have ever read. I wish I would have read it when I was thirteen. I think every girl should get a copy of this. I finally understand my body!
5,"Great for every couple, even if you're not using FAM","As many women do, I was tired of hormonal BC. After tons of searching I was recommended to read this book and it has been a fantastic resource. Easy to read and impliment, and not too scary for the husbands to review. It could have been more technical, so I may follow up with The Art of NFP. I really look forward to using FAM, and am so thankful FAM is gaining acknowledgement and credibility."
4,A great book!,"I read this book in two days because I couldn't put it down. I found it to be very informative. I learned so much about my own body that I never knew prior to reading this. I gave it four stars because the author Toni Weschler does repeat herself numerous times throughout the text. However, because of this book I have started charting my cycles and have learned so much about my own reproductive health. This book is not just for women who want are trying to conceive, but it is also good for women who are trying to avoid pregnancy as well. If you suspect that something may be wrong with your reproductive system then I highly recommend that you read this book before going to the doctor so that you and the doctor both can understand what is possibly going on. It will save your doctor a lot of guess work. I will hand this book down to my daughter so that she can understand what is normal when it comes to her reproductive health. All in all a very empowering book!"
4,Good information!,"I also bought the Kippley's book on NFP along with this book (as so many people had suggested it) I foudn the information very helpful but I think I like the rules for the other book better (a little more clear and I don't feel like I'm risking as much) The TCOYF site is very helpful, especially the online charting."
5,Awesome resource,"This book is incredibly well written and manages to be entertaining and extremely informative at the same time. Even having taken courses on women's health in nursing school, I feel I learned so much by reading this book - both new information and new ways to look at things I had already learned. I initially borrowed this book from the library but found it such a great resource, I had to buy it! I strongly recommend owning a copy if you intend to practice FAM or even if you just want to understand your own body better."
5,A Great Read for ALL Women!,"I purchased this book, read it right away, and love it. It's so incredibly informative! I'm 26 and have a child, and I STILL learned a lot from this book.Don't be deceived - this book is not just for those wishing to get pregnant! It's for women of all ages in all stages of life! From girls just getting their cycle to those who are hitting menopause! Every woman can benefit from this wonderful, informative book!"
5,This works!,"This book is essential if you are considering getting pregnant. After following the instructions I became pregnant right away. I was amazed. There are only two or three basic body signs you need to know, and it's quite simple. I was shocked by how little I knew about my own body, which is a shame. This book will enable women to know their bodies better and to waste less time trying to conceive. If every woman knew what was in this book, I think we would stop doubting our fertility so religiously."
5,MUST READ FOR ALL FEMALES,"This book is great for all women ages 16 and up. It covers a whole lot more than my biology professor ever did!! And those sessions that we had when they split up the boys and girls to have ""those talks"". If you are on some kind of birth control right now, this book just might make you want to throw it all out the window! I am a recent newlywed, and I am terrible about taking the pill. So my husband and I decided on our honeymoon to begin this process that the book describes. I must say after 5 1/2 yrs of being on the pill, my sex drive has increased ten fold! My husband loves the ""new"" me! And I have this book to thank because I know my body soooo much better than I could ever imagine! Thanks Toni!!"
5,Why don't they teach this in school?,We are planning on getting pregnant next year after being on the pill for many years. I am the type of person who needs to research everything so I started educating myself on what to expect. I saw this book in many referrals from babycentral and thebump and decided to pick it up. It truly has more info than I ever expected. The only thing I am uncertain of is the very specific and daily charting the method recommends but we are looking forward to putting it to the test in a few months!
5,SUCCESS !,"After two years of trying to get pregnant, I bought Toni's book and was pregnant 3 months later. I am now expecting a baby due at the end of this year.This is a great book! I would recommend it to everyone serious about getting pregnant."
5,THE Fertility handbook...period.,"Almost 3 years ago my husband and I began trying for our second child, we thought it would be easy, but we were wrong. Finally I turned to the internet for information and help. I stumbled across Fertily Friend Online,too bad its not nice there now like it was then. On this site I soon realised that in less than 24 hours no less than 7 people had reccomened this book. I ordered the book online, then while I waited for it (all of 2 days) I did more research. I soon discovered that on just about any site about TTC I went to, this was the #1 book period! I have learned more than I knew possible about my body. I know exactly what is going on, I never ever have that ""Am I late or not?"" feeling going on. This book should be given to each and every girl as she becomes a woman, its a rite of passage to know this information. Thanks to TCOYF I now have a 1 year old baby boy! This book is a MUST READ. Also check out the TCOYF website and Ovusoft fertility software."
4,Good Gynecological Education,"This book has something to offer women who are trying to get pregnant, women who are trying not to get pregnant, and women who just want to understand more about the way their body works. It teaches women how to tell what stage of their cycle their body is in based on waking temperature and the consistency of cervical fluid. My only complaint is that some of the text is a bit hokey, but you can skip over that, and the substantive parts are very good, offering sufficient detail to follow the instructions she gives for tracking one's cycle."
5,A must read for everyone of child bearing years!,"This is a great book, and a must have for every woman. It is really a reference book more than anything else."
5,Wish I would have known sooner,"This is the best book about women and for women that I have ever read. I only wish that I had read it sooner. I think that every woman should read this book! Now I know how to read my body and things that are going on with my body, and why I wasn't able to get pregnant. I know that there are a lot of women out their trying to get pregnant and this book could help you succeed or figure out what the problem might be. It will teach you a great alternative to birth control. It's a must have!"
4,Every girl should look into this,"It's a bit of a dry read, but there is a lot of good information in here. I charted to avoid conceiving for two years, then when we decided to start trying for a baby I got pregnant in the first month."
5,Amazing book,"This is the book every girl at the age of 14 should get in her health class - I can't say how many women I've met who didn't know (like me, until the age of 22) that there are certain times of the month when it's fairly difficult for a woman to get pregnant. When I first read this book, I got so angry that this information had been withheld from me. Just ridiculous. However, thanks to Toni Weschler, we have an excellent excellent guide. I still use her charts - and largely thanks to that, no pregnancies yet! And probably fairly soon, when I'm ready to have kids, I'll use her charts to help me get pregnant. I can't say enough about this book - check it out from your library and you'll see.. and then get yourself a copy, it'll be dog-eared in no time. ;)"
4,TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR FERTILITY,"I FOUND THIS BOOK HAD USEFUL INFORMATION ON LEARNING MORE ABOUT YOUR CYCLE AND WHAT TO LOOK FOR. THIS WILL BE MY 4TH MONTH ON TRYING TO BECOME PREGNANT AND I HAVE ONLY USED THIS METHOD FOR 1 MONTH. I FOUND IT VERY HELPFUL AS TO WHEN TO DETERMINE WHEN I'M OVULATING, BEFORE I HAD NO CLUE, I JUST BASICALLY KINDA GUESSED. THE SAD THING IS I'M ALSO A OB NURSE AND WOULD OF BEEN EXPECTED TO KNOW MY BODY MORE AND WHAT TO LOOK FOR. SO I LEARNED SOME VERY USEFUL INFORMATION FROM THIS BOOK, THAT YOU DON'T ALWAYS LEARN IN NURSING SCHOOL OR EVEN ON THE JOB. THE BLANK CHARTS IN THE BACK OF THE BOOK ARE EXCELLENT TO USE AND YOU HAVE A VARIETY OF STYLES TO PICK FROM, DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU ARE MONITORING. THE ONLY DOWNFALL ON THIS BOOK THAT I FOUND, IS ALL OF THE CASE STUDIES AFTER AWHILE, KINDA OF GOT BORING. I WOULD OF LIKED TO SEEN MORE INFORMATION ON MORE HOLISTIC TYPE OF APPROACHES TO INCREASING CHANCES OF CONCIEVING."
3,Arrived on Time,"Didn't read much... Arrived on time. Older book, great details but skimmed through most of it. Ordered it off a recommendation of a friend."
2,Great: if your body is perfect,"But if you have PCOS, 45 - 100+++ days cycles and no Cervical Fluid this book is not for you. It is written for the people with no fertility issues."
3,Taking charge or Insight?,"Although I have to applaud Ms. Weschler's efforts and I consider this a valuable resource, please consider this Insight rather than Taking Charge of your fertility."
2,Dont waste your money,"I ordered this book because me and dh have been TTC for about 4 months (I know thats not long but Im the type that if it doesent happen right away I research everything that can help) Everything that was in this book you can find online (actually you can find more information online than you can the book).. This book only gives you half the information that you have to further research online... So save your money and check out the web, and if you must have this book, try checking it out at the libarary.... Again I really dont know how this book got such good reviews (if youve been TTC for awhile this book if pretty much worthless!) I gave it 2 stars because it did have good pictures (really helps to see what your body does through your cycle). But like I said check it out at the libarary or a book store before you buy it..."
1,Didn't work,People rave about this but I feel like I wasted a lot of time on this method and feel that doing the ovulation strips are more accurate. Don't waste your time too
3,A Decent Resource,"This book has plenty of information on how to prevent and achieve pregnancy. For someone who doesn't have any known fertility issues, this is a decent resource. Unfortunately, the book is a bit sterile, and those looking for infertility help and/or anecdotes won't really find much in this book."
3,Excellent book - poor support website,"I bought this book 2 1/2 years ago while I was still trying to conceive. It had taken us a long time and I decided to ""get serious"" about it. This book was jammed full of information that I never knew. I credit it completely to my getting pregnant the first month after I read it. I also joined the support website at ovusoft.com. I spent over 2 years on this website and considered myself a supportive member of their community. The website was recently done for 10 days with no advance notice and when it was brought back on-line many members were banned from the website for no specific reason. It offers lots of support when you are TTC and pregnant but nothing for the average woman looking for a supportive on-line community."
3,Good but didn't work for me,"This book has many good tips, but only one actually increased my sperm count and semen volume. My opinion is, search the word ""semen"" by Jason Michael on Amazon. AWESOME results."
5,EXCELLENT!,"This book is an excellent resource guide for ANY woman. Whether you want to get pregnant, are trying to avoid pregnancy, or just want to understand your body better, this book is for you!"
5,Great purchase. Recommended for all women!,"This book is so helpful in understanding your body, your cycle, and your fertility. I thought I was pretty well educated on this topic but I learned so much from reading this book. This goes above and beyond ""the basics"". I highly recommend it for everyone."
4,Achieving pregnancy,"There are a lot of good things about this book. I found that the methods Tomi Weschler described were not as easy as she would have you believe, but it is definitely a helpful and useful book. I recommend it to anybody trying to achieve a pregnancy."
3,Very good information,"I bought this book recently, try to get pregnant not right away but would like to have the knowledge when the time comes. This book is perfect in terms of getting to know your own body. It is true (and sad) that our sex education is very minimal, at least in my era. So I did learn quite a bit of new info from this book, and I am charting now just to see how my cycles are.But I do agree with other users: the author do repeat a lot, and I don't think the FAM is a very good birth control method either. I think reader should consider the pros and cons for themselves and decide based on their own situation."
4,Informative and Worth Your Time,"The book itself is a very worthwhile read and tells you a lot about what to expect throughout your pregnancy. I read the chapters for up to Month 4 in just a short time over two nights, so it's an easy read."
5,Mujer informada vale por dos. Woman informmed !!,"Este libro deberia ser la guia de cada mujer en el planeta. Explica detalladamente como funciona el cuerpo femenino en el ciclo mensual y como cada una ovulamos en dias diferentes al 14 ""como la sabiduria popular dice"". o recomiendo muchisimo si quieres conocer mas de tu ciclo, si tienes problemas de fertilidad, si quieres comunicarte mejor con tu hija o simplemente por cultura general. Viene ademas con una muestra de software para llevar tus datos en tu computadora. Toca eso si comprar el software aparte.This is a book that must be requiered for every woman in the planet. It explains in detail how the body works in the menstrual cycle and how women ovulate in different days during the cycle not only on day 14th, ""as the old tales said""."
4,A good book overall....,"I am personally disappointed by the information provided in this book. I feel as though I got most of it already online and elsewhere. The main reason I wanted the book was that I thought I would get a more scientific description of how to identify the types of cervical fluid. Instead, I got the same advice that I get everywhere else, and none of the descriptions match my cervical fluid types. I also feel no closer to understanding cervical position."
4,Good book,I would recommend this book to anyone in the quest for parenthood. We always think we know all about procreation until with navigate a book like this one.
5,A Must Read!,This isn't a book that you should want to read - you NEED to read it! Every woman must read this book to truly understand her body regardless of what stage she's at. There are too many myths and old wives' tales about our bodies. Just read it and you'll see for yourself.
5,AWESOME!,This book has so much information! I really think all pre-teen girls should have to read this book for the knowledge it has regarding the how/why of the body during the mentrual cycle! So interesting!Plus it really works for getting pregnant as well! There have been three friends now get pregnant on the first cycle after tracking with this books info!
3,Craving Mommyhood,"This book was recommended by midwife. A more involved than I anticipated with a toddler and current schedule. Gives insight to a woman's body, Must be very comfortable with oneself."
4,Great Book for General Fertility Knowledge,"I purchased this book along with The Art of Natural Family Planning and they definitely compliment eachother well. Taking Charge of your Fertility has more supplemental information about your cycle and fertility in general and does not approach the subject from a religious point of view, however it does not have as concise explanations of the charting and rules as The Art of NFP does. Since I am not religious I find these books work well together but someone who is pursuing this topic in a religious way probably won't like this book very much. I certainly use my other book more but I find this book has more in depth info. regarding general fertility awareness, it is a good reference book but there is almost too much info. I am very glad I bought this book not so much for avoiding pregnancy but because I have gained more insight into my reproductive health."
5,All women need this book,"I wish I had been given this book at 17 years old... then I would have had a much clearer picture of what was going on.I bought this book to get pregnant (which I am now 8 weeks along), but it is equally important for women who DON""T want to get pregnant! Also, it really explains and clears up the mystery of what is going on ""down there""."
5,"Great sale, prompt delivery :)",Book was in very good condition and included the CD when it stated it would not come with the purchase. A very good surprise indeed.
5,Excellent Book,"I'm not trying to conceive at this time but found this book extremely helpful. Gives a lot more information than I ever expected. It was recommended to me by a friend of mine who was trying to conceive. I discounted her recommendation at first but after looking it over in a bookstore, I had to buy it. I recommend this book for every woman."
5,Great Book,"This book has taught me a lot about fertility and what goes on in my own body. I am currently using the FAM method to put off pregnancy until next year but I have learned so much about my own body and cycle that I can feel confident when I do choose to have another child. With my first child I had no idea when I got pregnant. My due date was incorrect because I thought I had irregular cycles. Well nothing was irregular I just needed to learn about my own body. I reccomend this book if you are trying to conceive or if you are in a committed relatioship and just trying to get off birth control and ""Take charge of your fertility""."
5,A MUST READ - Very Informative,"We were trying for over 1.5 years to get pregnant. I thought I was very knowledgeable from my own research on the internet, but I learned even more from this book. The book is very candid and thorough, a must read for anyone trying to get pregnant. I became pregnant the cycle after having read the book and was spared the agony of infertility testing that the doctor had recommended."
5,Every woman should read this book.,"After reading the first pages of this book I saw myself. As women we are told so little about our bodies and our cycles. Every women should read this book, just to get the knowledge to empower themselves and trust their own bodies to know if something is truely wrong, when they are fertile, when they aren't fertile, if they could be pregnant, etc. If I ever have a daughter, she will get this book!"
4,It worked for me!,My husband and I had been trying to conceive for 4 months without any luck so I decided to buy this book - we got pregnant the 1st month that I started charting. I am assuming that most people reading this review are trying to conceive so I will add that I also was taking an herb called Vitex which I would highly recommend as well. I believe that the combination of this book and Vitex helped me get pregnant.
5,Wonderful Book!,"This was a wonderful and informative book. My husband and I were set on using natural birth control when we got married, and weren't quite sure of the specifics. Originally, we got a book on NFP (very similar to the FAM method described in this book). The information was very similar, but this book was so much easier to read and understand. We thought the charting and temperature taking would be too much, but we got used to it pretty quickly. The book also came with a computer program that I love, because it calculates everything for you, and even predicts your cycle (very accurately for me!). I would highly recommend this book to any couple who wants to avoid or achieve pregnancy. I have read many books and internet articles that have their information all wrong about your temperature and your fertile and infertile phases. Written by doctors none the less! Even more reason to READ THIS BOOK!"
1,Book review,"Quite simple, do not recommend if from a medical background.Also out of date need more up to dated literature. And explain the studies with references"
3,Great for those who are trying to conceive only!,"Since I'm trying to conceive I found this book to be of great help. The author says it's helpful for those who are trying to avoid pregnancy as well for those who aren't. But after reading it I got to the conclusion that it can be pretty trick to use FAM to avoid pregnancy. First of all you basically will have to abstain from sex for at least 1/3 of the month...this means that even if you get turned on on those days you can't do ""it"". I'd feel safer using another birth control method. But for those who are wanting a baby, it's very helpful!"
4,"A good reference, not ideal for everyone","This book is very informative on matters of the female reproductive system and the reproductive process, in general. I purchased it with a goal of pregnancy achievement and while the Fertility Awareness Method (FAM) is not really applicable for me (you have to have reasonably predictable, clock-work cycles), it was a very interesting read and a good reference book."
3,This if about FAM and nothing more.,"This is an excellent book on the FAM method. FAM stands for Fertility Awareness Method. The title of the book is slightly misleading by having it sound like a definitive book on all fertility methods. The definitive guide to natural birth control, pregnancy achievement and reproductive health could be misconstrued as covering those three topics and not as book for natural birth control, natural pregnancy achievement and general understanding of natural reproductive health. There are other fertility topics that are not covered. Updated on 9/17/12"
3,Explanation was good - implementation was hard,"This book made me want to pull my hair out while trying to have a baby. It gave me ways to track my ovulation cycle that made me go nuts. I had to make sure I took my temp at the right time, check cervical mucous (ew!) and track it all. I threw it out the minute my husband accidentally erased my temperature on the thermometer. Save your money and just go buy some ovulation sticks. Ugh."
5,Great for Husbands Too!,"This is a fantastic book. My wife was in Iraq at the time, and we each ordered a copy to read. As a man, I found the book very informative in a simple but clear way--it helped me to develop a deep appreciation and understanding of my wife and the way her body works. She started charting while she was still deployed and when we were finally reunited, she got pregnant in about 3 days! And we knew right away!Now, it's three years later, she's out of the Army, we're trying for a third, and are once again turning to this excellent book.I can't say enough about it: it is an awesome resource."
4,"If you're having problems conceiving,book is worth the read!","The author helps you understand what is going on with the female body and makes the most efficient use of your love-making time. It is well worth the read. After one cycle of using the Fertility Awareness Method detailed in the book, my husband and I got pregnant."
5,"If you want to get pregnant, you need to buy this book!","After 10 years of waiting for a little angel to join our family, the dream came true. This book was the solution for me. I have endometriosis problems, surgery and not able to ovulate on time this book gave me the tools that I needed to get pregnant.So I put it to the test and like the author said: ""if you don't get pregnant in 6 months, you need to contact a specialist"". Needless to say I didn't make it to the 6 cause in 4 months I got pregnant. And now I am a proud mom of a beautiful 13 months old son.Just get it!"
5,Info for Every Woman,"Whether you are trying to get pregnant or trying to avoid it, this is information that every woman should know about her body."
5,TCOYF,This is one of the best books I have ever read! I am a biology major so I loved gaining even more knowledge about my body. I highly recommend this empowering book!
5,Very informative,This is a must read for every woman.I have learn't alot about my body this past 30 days.Very detailed and specific.Overall a well written book.
4,Great Information,This book provides so much information that I couldn't find in any other sources. It's not just for a woman who wants to find out more about fertility. It can be for any woman who wants to know more about their body.
5,Excellent book!,"This book describes all that I wanted to know in simple, jargon-free language. Perfect!"
4,Great book,This book has been very helpful and insightful. I feel I now have a better understanding of my own body and what different things are happening during my cycle
3,Great as background-Hard to sing,"THe arrangements are very original which is great as background music but makes them hard to sing along with, unless you do it every day."
1,Yuck!,"I was very disappointed with this CD. I teach preschool and thought that this would be an upbeat, lively CD; instead I found it very slow and drug out. My kids are big fans of Dr. Jean, her CD's are fun and quick. This CD was not at all what I thought it would be, it was WAY too slow."
5,When your fluval 205 filter is leaking...this is the fix.,"drip, drip, drip....Fixed it! I guess after three years it was going to leak. Changed the o-ring and... no leak!"
2,Very miss leading,"This book is very misleading for the exam. The test in the book are all multiple choice questions but the actual exams are combinations of multiple choice, fill in the blank and do it yourself answer types. Other than that the book is a good reference."
5,Beautiful,"I highly recommend this little collection of Marvell's poetry. His style is so beautiful, and his dialogues between soul and pleasure and soul and body are absolutely amazing. This book is worth buying just to have those poems on hand in your collection.This book is small enough to throw in your purse or bag without weighing you down and nice to keep a little bit of gorgeous poetry on hand for moments when you need an escape.Highly recommended!"
4,We use it all the time,It is very useful for many purposes. Cover is not as good as expected. Received the product very quickly.
2,Disappointing,I would recommend ordering a different type of cold pack. The covers are thin cheap-o's and they are not filled as much as they should be with gel.
5,Cold and Quality,This ice pack stays cold beyond the 30 min that I have it on my knee and is cold enough for another go around. It can also be heated. The price is exactly as much as you'd want to pay for ice packs.
4,Good quality gel packs,Many gel packs I've purchased in the past were not really made out of real gel material. These two packs were well made with thick plastic and the gel doesn't freeze up like water.
5,Hot/Cold Packs,"I love the hot/cold packs. As someone who suffers from migraine's these are truly a blessing. Freeze them, wrap a thin towel around them and place them on your forehead......lifesaver!"
5,Great Product,"Great Cold Packs. They are long and thin, thus very flexible. I use them around my neck. The covers are also nice to use...so much better than wrapping your ice pack in a paper towel."
2,dissapointed,"after a day in a 0F freezer, these remain flexible but only able to hold cold for 10 minutes. that may be useful for an athlete cooling a sore ankle or wrist after muscle fatigue, but it's useless to anyone using these to reduce swelling. the thin cotton coat didn't really matter since these won't stay cold long enough to cold burn you anyway. I have swelling from hip surgery, so I use one slipped down into my pant pocket after a long walk - a pretty useless application, but it's better than nothing."
2,Item popped and broke in the microwave,I bought this for my mom thinking it would be as good as the one she already had which was fine to heat up in the microwave for several times but this one popped in the microwave only after a few times.
3,not effective,The heat is not retained for long. Simple rice bag is more effective than this. Not for massage. Difficult to handle when its hot.
4,Good for the price,"To begin I do not and will not use these as hot packs if you want to do that use a wet towel and the microwave it's not worth the risk of an exploding hot pack........ I'm not sure how long these cold packs will last I've only been using them for a month every other day or so. I gave them four stars because they only stay cold for about 25 minutes but they do get the job done. Their a good size for wrapping around your neck or knee. The cloth covers are a bit thin but that allows the cold to pass through without giving you freezer burn, anyone that uses cold packs knows what I mean. As far as durability only time will tell, I tend to use things like this gently and over the years that seems to have paid off because things last, at least for me they do. if your the kind of person that is rough with things these may not work for you. I can say with confidence that for the price these cold packs are worth the price and worth a try."
5,Well made,In typical Breyer tradition this is a well made horse. My only suggestion is that it be hung right at a tree light as Slew is such a dark horse you don't see details without the lighting.
2,just the CDs without the book,"Here at Amazon you'ld get just the double CD, not the package with the book as stated at the Product Description."
1,Buyer Beware... Wrong Product Listed!!!,"I received the wrong item from Tuccini due to the above inaccurately listed description and photo (item still has not been corrected or removed). I received the blue 2007 edition instead of the green 2006 edition. Since they don't actually carry the item shown, they processed my return and refund within two business weeks without additional cost to me, but unfortunately it was too late for my need."
5,Great old tech!,"This is a great tv for someone who is hell-bent on not getting a LCD for just about the same price. It was my first 32 inch and I've had it for several years. It's been in my den (guest room/gym/extra comfy tv room) and I'm getting ready to get rid of it to my sister to replace her 27"", IF it fits. I just got a huge LED for the living room, so the big LCD in the LR now is going in the game room and the 32"" LCD in the game room is going in the den. I can't believe it is being sold on here for almost $300. It should go for $100 at the most! If I end up having to sell mine to a stranger, I'll put it up for $100!"
4,Picnic Basket,This basket was everything the ad said it was. Not a bad quality at all. Haven't put alot of stuff in it and tested out the handle yet though...
3,Really hope they release all the seasons eventually....,Although I'd like to see them speed up the pace somewhat. At this pace I'll be around 80 by the time they all come out on DVD....vbg.
4,A season of transition,"By Season 5,""saturday Night Live"" was experiencing a period of transition:Dan Aykroyd & John Belushi had left the show the previous season to pursue other interests-To fill thst void,additional performers were added,such as Peter Aykroyd (Dan's brother),musical director Paul Shaffer,Brian Doyle Murray (Bill's brother),Don Novello aka Father Guido Sarducci,Al Franken & Tom Davis & Harry Shearer,who later went on to do various character voices on ""The Simpsons""-There were some great guest hosts such as Steve Martin who hosted twice as did Buck Henry,Strother Martin,best known to movie fans as the warden in the Paul Newman prison movie ""Cool Hand Luke""-That movie is parodied as was ""Deliverance"" in the show hosted by Burt Reynolds-Finally,the musical guests included Blondie,David Bowie,The B-52's,Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers,& R&B duo Sam & Dave-All in all,a fantastic season."
3,Bought it for Chicago.,"Wanted to watch live Chicago. Got what I wanted. The skits were weak. Bill Murray's ""broken-down singer in a lounge"" schtick was the only tolerable moment other than the Chicago performance."
3,snl overview,"great stuff wish it was digitally enhanced,i have hd and blueray guess iam spoiled.cant say enough of the talent in ther good old days."
4,Last great season for SNL,This the last gr8 season for SNL. Everything after this was total garbage. Although Dan Chevy and John are absent for this season there are still gr8 performances from Jane and Gilda and new comers Bill and Harry plus more involvement from Al Franken. Worth the purchase price for the Belair Arabs sketches alone. Father Guido shines in this season.
5,Zeitgeist,you can waste your time comparing seasons and cast members and being an overly critical comedy snob all you want. I just love these SNL collections because these episodes are like a time travel machine. No other show has the ability to transport me back in time as well as SNL does. I'm hoping they eventually release every season ever made on DVD.
5,Jesus Christ kicks ass!,What more could you want? Jesus Christ killing lesbian vampires with a Mexican wrestler. It was hilarious nonstop laughter. Everything about it was wonderful. And it shouldn't offend religious people because its Jesus kicking some serious [but]! This is decidedly one of my favorite movies. I predict it being the next cult classic.
1,Depends on what you want it for,"I really wish Amazon had a way to give two ratings to the same item. The one-star rating above is for the movie. It's a bad movie, and not ""bad-in-a-good-way"" bad, just bad. It's boring. Jesus loses his long hair and robes about twenty mintes into the film, and from then on it's like watching a Ben Stiller clone in some really dull fight scenes.Regardless of the movie's quality, this DVD gets Five Full Stars (*****) as a collectible. It's worth the money just to be able to grab this out of your DVD collection and show it to people, or hear their reactions when they see it on your shelf. Buy it for the title, buy it for the case, buy it for the cover art -- just don't buy it for the film."
5,Awesomely campy B movie in Hi-Def glory!,"If you want to see J.C. himself team up with a Mexican wrestler to take on lesbian vampires, look no further!"
2,needs help from heaven,I turned this turkey dark after an hour. I debated if I should finish it. but some videos get better. this one for example. the last half was sort of good... what was wrong?. the guy playing Jesus was inadequate. the musical numbers were like me singing in the shower. the fight scenes were worse that spaghetti westerns. from some reviews I thought this movie would be an unknown gem in the ilk of REPO MAN or 6 string samurai..alas it was not to be. this flick will be re gifted.
1,90 minutes I'll never get back,"For the love of mike, avoid this movie! I purchased it based on the review and in the belief that eveything is either funny/dumb, or dumb/funny. this movie was just BAD. This makes the Story of Ricky look like an oscar winner. The script was pretty bad, the acting is worse. The charachters have a problem conveying realistic emotion and either look like their reciting lines they've memorized, or they're so over the top, its stupid. It just wasnt good. I've tried giving away my copy to everyone I know, they watch it and give it back, blaming me for having poisoned them with this bad, bad movie. you could do so much better by watching paint age or grass grow. I'd rather get fat than watch this movie again. If I could have given it negative stars, I would have."
1,If you like Vampire movies SKIP THIS ONE OUT!,"Honestly! If you are a true vampire fan... don't waste you money on this movie... it's pathetic!BUT, If you like foolish, brainless, B-type comedies... then this is the one for you... and enjoy it!."
2,Disappointing at Best,"There are already some honest reviews about the acting/effects/etc. so I will approach this review from a different angle.I had hopes of a very good B-Movie, which is why I purchased the movie at a very cheap price (fortunately). I am a Christian, but the title didn't automatically equal blasphemy. In fact, the only place where the ""red flags"" went up was at the very end when the script writer decided to give his interpretation of who Jesus was... a man who said some great things to live by, but but not the Son of God (my interpretation of the actual words spoken).That statement at the end could have been overlooked if the rest of the product would have been of some 'B' quality. ALthough the writer had an idea of what Jesus would have been capable of doing, the writer showed no ability of having a Jesus who was complex and cohesive.The movie idea was very promising, but it didn't even come close to the expectations of mine."
1,"Great premise, terrible excecution","When you hear the title, Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter, you think Jesus Christ, in full linens, Hunting Vampires. Instead of this, I watched 90 minutes of pure crap! Jesus only looks like Jesus for the first few scenes, and then runs around Vancouver like a punk rocker, (By the way, a Canadian Punk is absolutley impossible)plus Jesus fights more Athiests than Vampires! The Movie had the chance to be raw and hilariously offensive, but intead the Writer/Director played it safe, thus losing the humor. This movie is Garbage, the creator should take this story and sell it to someone who could do something great with the idea, Like Trey Parker."
4,Big surprise,"I didn't know what to expect when i rented this .I thought it would probably be some cheesy low budget lamo production.To my surprise it is an excellent cheesy low budget movie with tons of personality and quirkiness.Jesus is recruited by a local toronto parish to kill the vampires that are killing all the lesbians in town.There are a few funny lesbian jokes and jesus having a conversation with god appearing as a talking dessert is hilarious.Having jesus allied with El Santo,a mexican wressler isastroke of genious.;-)Well worth a rent to check it out and if you like it buy it like i did."
3,"Astonishing, kick-butt action","If you are reading this review, you obviously don't need a review of this movie. Word of mouth made you aware of ""JCVH"". If you haven't seen the movie, bon voyage.My friends and I agreed that a good drinking game could be enjoyed while watching the movie. Drink each time there is an ass-shot. This movie likes bottoms. A lot."
5,Fits like a glove!,Heavy duty. Well made. Fits the Weber Premium One-Touch charcoal grill perfectly.
3,GREAT JUST DONT BUY FROM KAKU10,"I GAVE IT 3 STARS BECAUSE I HAVE ONE PURCHASED AND IT WORKS GREAT BUT THE SECOND ONE I ORDERED GOT SENT FROM SELLER ""KAKU10"" WHO SENT ME THE 211K INSTEAD OF THE 211. THEN PROCEEDED TO ARGUE WITH ME (That is the only 211 receiver available for dishnetwork. There is no other version.) THAT IS AN ACTUAL COPY-PASTE FROM THE EMAIL HE SENT ME. LIKE I DONT KNOW WHAT I HAVE ORDERED. SO I HAD TO SEND HIM HIS OWN AMAZON PRODUCT LINK TO PROVE HIM WRONG."
5,Excellent,"Heard this album about 20 years ago and have been unable to find til now. Have all of her other albums but think this is her best. Great R&B rendition of IF YOU'RE NOT BACK IN LOVE BY MONDAY. Best rythm and lyrics is CHEATIN IS A THING. This lady can really ""get down"""
5,just the right color,"I searched everywhere for a bronze green patina and got this because of positive reviews. It was a perfect match to a set of patina bronze lights I had, which prevented me having to scrap them and get new ones because of a missing part."
3,"Affordable, but flawed.","This is indeed a very good publication of some very important works by Ravel. Certainly the price alone justifies the purchase, considering Durand editions are still nearly 50% or higher in price. The edition does however, through no fault of Dover because it is a reprint, present some notational flaws that have not been corrected. Nancy Bricard has published a much more authoritative and instructive edition for Alfred Masterworks, for instance of Gaspard de la Nuit. Correcting many of the most obvious of errors. The Dover edition is still reliable, but one must warn that a proper performance dictates cross-reference with other editions."
5,My kids now get the same stories I had,"My father used to read us Uncle Wiggly. We loved all of the stories.These are great bedtime stories for the little ones.They are written in a fun odd way, I'm not quite sure how to describe it,perhaps ""old english"", but the kids understand it enough to follow along.The world that the funky old rabbit lives in is wonderfully described. You'll pictureit perfectly after the first few stories."
5,Vintage Card Game,This game will bring back great memories for those who remember this game from the 1960's.We took this game on vacation and our kids had a great time with it also...The replica car is also a great remembrance...
5,One great game,"I don't have the tin version but an earlier version. The cards look different but the game is played the same. I have been playing this with my now current 10 year old for 2 years and we both love it. A little luck, some strategy, and a whole lot of fun. Don't let the age levels fool you-adults will enjoy this as well. A classic that will never go out of style."
5,After the Apple,"I loved this book.It was wonderful,I higly recommend this book to scholars of the Divine Feminine and Biblical Scholarship.This gives the women of the Bible a wonderful overview.It is a positive and humanizing way to look at the Matriarchs of the Jewish Faith and Christian as well.Angela Miller."
3,underwhelmed,"I have read and re-read many sections of Rosenblatts' previousbook ""Wrestling with Angels,"" and have relied on it in drawinginformation to write and develop Torah lessons for synagogueuse. I do not believe that ""After the Apple"" is written withthe same depth as her ""Wrestling with Angels."" In preparingpresentations, I would still turn back to ""After the Apple""for Rosenblatt's views and interpretations, but other sourcesare better in analysis. I also think that Rosenblatt presentssome of these stories, especially the ones about the ""foundingmothers"" as actual history rather than as narrative theology.Rabbi Fred V. Davidow"
5,Krisiundile propagation of stereopsis,"auditory inception of 'assassination' produced the following somatosensory transactions: exacerbation of nystagmic tremor acceeding to hypertensile transduction in the occular dominance columns, inducing profuse euphoric nausea and aphagia. This is beautiful, this is art."
1,"Lots of talk, little rythm!",Two or three catchy tunes but punctuated by recording studio banter that is cute at first listening only. Mostly slow love songs pivoting around some distinctive riffs. Has none of the edginess or drive of Rythmn Nation. The best cuts are on the radio. Skip it.
4,A Very Good CD,"I have been a Janet fan since Control and when i heard this album the first time I must confess that it wasn't i expected... but now that I've heard it with all my attention I just can say that ""All for you"" is an excellent album except for ""Truth"" (I don't like that song). This record compiles all the music styles she recorded since control until today: Up-tempo songs, ""baby makin'"" melodies, tender ballads, her agressive side, and overall her bright side.Now I hear this CD all the time because I love it!My favorite songs are All for you, Someone to call my lover, You ain't right, Trust a Try, Son of a gun, and Love scene.I really think that Janet made a very good work with this album and the time will say the last word."
1,this shouldn't be all for you,"Trust Miss J. to come out wif another unimpressive single. Doesn't Really Matter sounded really chessy but the video improved it just a little. All For You sounded promising when the 30-second preview was unleashed, but when the whole song was played, it sounded dated and just a copycat of DRM. Plus tha horrible 80's video! Oh god, she won MTVIcon, my goodness - the video was way too cheap and unispringly boring. Even Miss Lopez did a better job with her lame Love Don't Cost A Thing. The fact that both DRM and All 4 U could have gone #1 shows that Janet. is hugely popular in the US. I hope the new album would be promising. To date, janet.'s still her best album, followed by the dark Velvet Rope even though it was less commercially successful. This is a way too desperate attempt for janet. to sell again... This is definitely not for fans!"
4,Her Best Song In Years,"Up-beat songs have always been a favourite of mine, so it would come as no suprise to say i LOVE this song. Janet has managd to produce a song that is funky and dancey but has meaningful lyrics as well. Well Done!!!"
3,Great music -- disappointing lyrics,"I'm a long time Janet fan -- loved the music, was disappointed with the lyrics. Should have had a warning label on it. Come on, Janet -- you've got the talent and don't need to resort to that cheap tactic."
2,Parents beware,Preview this CD before you let your teens and younger listen. You'll have a lot of explaining to to otherwise. Explicit language and content
5,want some great summer music?,buy this and the janet. album and you won't want to hear anything else and you're all set for summer
5,Better than the Whole Album,This is a great song and performance from Janet Jackson. It demonstrates her vast talent and versatility. I really think this is an important song for her. It is not trite or trivial yet it still has great mass appeal.
4,Another great album,"I'd give this album five stars if it weren't for two things:-- the unnecessarily graphic language on a couple of songs (not very kid-friendly to say the least)-- all the talking she does between songs which forces me to hit the ""skip"" button each timeBut the rest of the album is great with some new Janet classics like Someone to Call My Lover, Trust, and All for You."
2,DEJA VU,"I agree with the ""All for Me? No Thanks!"" review. It is definitely on target. Janet's latest song is indistinguishable from earlier songs like ""Escapade"" and ""Nothing Really Matters."" The only ""new"" thing about the song is its retro feel, but even this is not particularly novel or innovative; Ms. Jackson has simply followed Lady Madonna's lead in reaccentuating and repopularizing the sounds of earlier decades. Finally, a hint to reviewers trying to convince other readers that this song is not ""bubble gum"" pop: to avoid losing all credibility, don't use phrases like ""this song is SOOOO not bubble gum!"" POP!"
4,Pretty Good -- but not classic Janet,"I don't know -- I'm a pretty big Janet fan; I LOVE Janet Jackson. But I'm more a fan of her classic hits. Granted, this is really the first Janet Jackson CD (not counting Design of a Decade) since ""Control"" that I can listen to the whole way through without wrinkling my nose, but at the same time, the hits from this CD don't even begin to match up to the hits from her older albums, except perhaps ""All For You."" I like the CD, but something about it -- well, just doesn't vibe."
2,janets weakest album,"IM A HUGE JANET FAN AND LOOKS FOREWARD TO EACH NEW RELEASE. SHE IS ONE OF FEW ARTISTS THAT I BUY THE FIRST DAY RELEASED AND IM ALWAYS CONFIDENT I WILL LOVE THE ENTIRE ALBUM. SHE HADNT DISPPOINTED ME UNTIL THIS ALBUM. THE FIRST SINGLE IS ONE OF HER BEST SINGLES EVER AND I HAD HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS RECORD UNFORTUNTELY THIS TIME JANET DIDNT DELIVER. MOST SONGS WERE AVERAGE SONGS ABOUT SEX AND RELATIONSHIPS, MANY SOUNDED VERY SIMILAR, NONE STUCK WITH ME. JANET DID HAVE A TOUGH ALBUM TO FOLLOW. THE VELVET ROPE I PERSONALLY FELT WAS HER BEST ALBUM. STILL LOVE JANET AND LOOKING FOREWARD TO THE NEXT IM CONFIDENT THIS TIME SHE WILL DELIEVER."
1,Rene's Presence is Truly Missed,I have every album that Janet has released starting from her self-titled 1982 lp `Janet Jackson.` AFY was a disappointment to say the least. You can really tell in the music that Rene is gone. The funk is just not there anymore. The title track is the best song on the album. The rest is downhill...
3,love it or hate it,"I have a love-hate relationship with this album. The songs that are really good are catchy pop songs like all for you and trust a try and doesn't really matter, and as for the rest, some of it I sometimes like, other times I can't stand it cause it's so boring compared to her previous wonderful work, and some tracks are downright .... You decide."
4,Janet Jackson's new Album (All For You),This is Janet laid back and letting off a little steam. The CD is very good. I recommend this CD for all Janet Jackson fans. She has a debut with Carly Simon which is excellent. This CD is different from all of her previous ones. I love it.With this album it shows that Janet has matured musically.
2,i gave it two stars because two songs are good,hey! i know u hate me for saying this but this album is not her best work. The good songs are All For U and Someone to call my lovah. janet jackson is a guenis. but she was too caught up in making a good comeback that she didn't have one. If janet reads this review than i want her to know that all her other albums are great. i own them all! this just isn't her best work
1,This is such a good dvd and cd,"I love this cd and dvd . on the dvd it hasthat's the way love goe's - if - again - because of love -any time, any place - you want this - janet behind the scensegot til it's gone - together again - togther again (deeper mix)-i get lonely - go deep - you - every time - the velvet rope behind the scense - all for you - someone to call my lover -all for you behind the scences - all for you live at the janet icon. and those are all the video's on the secound disc .this is a good cd and dvd you won't be sorry . i hopyou do like it if you buy it."
1,Smith Brothers,Take two lozenges and don't call me in the morning. Hopefully your throat will be clear of all that filth that it enunciates and pollutes our children's ears with. These lyrics are very upsetting. The prostitution of one's voice is very base and apparent here. To bait our children into this lurid abyss is despicable.
3,"Saved by the remixes!! Come on Janet, you can do better","This song has PUFF DADDY written all over it. The one thing is, Puffy did'nt do it. This song samples and relies heavily on the hook from Change's (Yes, Luther Vandross sings lead. He sang with Change before his debut solo album.) 'The Glory Of Love', without it Janet is singing acapella or close to it anyway.Janet is too high quality to start doing this and it is rather disappointing to me even though it is rather a fun song.The remixes improve this song 100% by first and formost, making Mrs. Janet stand on her own with ""original music"".Thunderpuss supercharges this song into a dance anthem that works really well.While this song is a disappointment, anyone of these remixes - except Thunderpuss's that is a bona-fide clubber - could've made a great original version."
2,She's Lost Her Touch,"Janet, Janet, Janet. What happened to you? This CD is not one of her best. She is trying to hard to keep up with the younger music and artists and she's losing her touch while doing so. Some tracks such as ""Someone to Call My Lover"" and ""Come On, Get Up"" are great tracks for parties, but the rest of the tracks are so trashy. There is only so much stuff you can say about making love on a CD. And that ""Son of A Gun"" song is much better on the radio when it's edited compared to this un-edited CD version. So I'm sorry to say this, but Ms. Jackson your music has sure gotten Nasty."
4,"all for you...the sequel to 1993's ""janet""","this is a great cd. from the acidic rock tinged ditties to the smooth trance beats. The best songs on here are YOU AIN'T RIGHT, WHEN WE OOOO, CHINA LOVE, LOVE SCENE, TRUST A TRY, SOMEONE TO CALL MY LOVER,SON OF A GUN & BETTER DAYS. The lyrics are somewhat clever and deep. I liked the unique musical-esque intro to TRUST A TRY as well as the spacey yet oceanic feel to WHEN WE OOOO. i actually got this after getting ""Damita Jo"", which is very blah compared to this.i must say...all for you is way better. This album is sort of contrasting with the JANET album in the sense where it had gritty trip pop with smooth and sensual ballads. hopefully there will be a better album after damita jo."
2,What the ... happened?,"I've been a Janet Jackson fan for years and I adored the Velvet Rope, but this album has got to go. I'm being generous with two stars out of five, mainly because Trust a Try & Someone to Call My Lover are the two songs I generally like on this cd. Overall the album sounds dated and is very bland. Even Janet's vocals are lacking....and who in the hell needs to know ...? She's really trying too hard to be sexy. Anyone can be sexual on record, but being sexy is something that comes naturally. The fake orgasms are laughable and the annoying cooing voice???.....it's [not good]. Maybe next time."
2,Janet would you please speak up!,"Janet jackson on this cd sounds like a purring kitten and not in a sexy kind of way because you can brely hear her sing she is very whining.The songs are monotonous not worth buying and the only singles worth listening are ""doesn't really matter "" and""love scene "" but the rest is dull or overdone. Janet sorry mais c'est deja vu! seen it all before nothing interesting in your package!"
5,ALL FOR YOU - THE VIDEO VERSION,"Track one is the radio edit, track two contains the video version. Everyone who's seen the video did hear a little bridge in the song, featuring Janet's old hit THE PLEASURE PRINCIPLE. Well, this is the only official cd where this video version is on. So, if you like it, get it."
3,ALL FOR YOU,"First of all, I am a HUGE Janet fan, so I snatched this CD up as soon as it came out. After Velvet Rope, I was anticipating another classic follow-up. However, it is not her best work. But, I am tired of all the bad reviews because she is expressing herself sexually and using profantity. Don't we all? And when a man sings about sex, it's not a big deal. Well, I give her ""big ups"" for having the courage to what she pleases and not worry what others have to say about her. My favorites are ""Trust a Try"", ""All For You"", ""When We Woo"", ""Someone To Call My Lover"", and ""Doesn't Really Matter"". If you love Janet, buy it!"
2,All For No One,"""All For You"" may be a little too over produced and way too boring. Janet was taking risks with ""janet."" and ""The Velvet Rope"". This album is way too short and way too boring and dull. ""China Love"" is the best song on the CD aside from ""All For You"" and a few others. The disc is just too easy and simple. Janet's already working on the follow-up to be released in early 2003. Hopefully she'll take a few more risks other than producing trashy songs like ""Would You Mind""."
3,GOOD BUT BELOW EXPECTATION,"I am a janet fan and really like her previous work, but i find this album not to be an improvement on the others, e.g Velvet rope which i went to see her perform on tour. Best songs for me are ""trust a try"",""come on get up"",""china white"",does'nt really matter and all for you. If she could tone down the profanity it will be better; it does not offend me but it's not necessary.It does not help the album at all.Sex sells but this is overkill. Madonna went down that route and it did not work; it only resulted in ridicule.And working with other producers for a different flavor may be a good idea. An album like Control which had fewer songs,litle or no sampling and NO interludes seems a better formula. I hope she goes back to the studio (and not wait another 4 years!)and surprise us all. Oh, did i mention that her videos and live performance are great?"
3,INTRESTING....BUT........,"I'm a firm believer that you don't have to be vulgar to display artistry. In Janet's early works,you would never imagine her doing some of the things she did on this album. On one track...I believe it's ""Would You Mind"" she gets...a little too excited to put it lightly. Also,the Carly Simon track is repulsive. But,the album does have its gems that make it worth buying. Of course the wonderful (but overplayed) ""All For You"" with its great beat and catchy chorus. ""Someone To Call My Lover"" is another great track and so is the 2000 single ""Doesn't Really Matter"" (although it is not the radio version) Anyways,there are some good tracks and if you like the singles,I say go for it. I just want to stress,though that this album is not for children by any means. But if you repulsed by recorded sexual simulations and certain four letter words,I think its best to stay clear and buy ""Design of A Decade."""
2,An Album of Air,"After ""All For You"", ""Someone To Call My Lover"" and ""Feels So Right"" there isn't much to this album. We've herad JJ do all this before and do it much better. Again we see her excentuating her sexuality over the self-assured knowledgable woman of ""Control"" and ""Rhythm Nation."" What is she trying to prove?Also the interludes she's been using since ""Control"" (yes they weren't separate cuts from the songs, but they are there) are really getting perposterous and annoying. Enough already! Ever since ""Janet."" she seems to be stuck in a rut of making the same album over and over again. It's time JJ get creative again or get out of the game."
2,What happened?,"After the schizophrenic and challenging grooves of ""The Velvet Rope,"" it seemed like Janet was on the verge of a real musical breakthrough. Instead she retreats into this...fluff. Now, don't get me wrong - I love fluff as much as the next person (as long as it's done well). But this goes absolutely nowhere. It's a cake made entirely of frosting.By the way, an aside to Tony Markham from Brooklyn - ""The glow of love"" was originally done by Change FEATURING Luther Vandross. Just so's you know."
3,Disappointing...,"I'm a big fan of Janet's, but this album is a total snoozer. Very little creativity, and the lyrics are a complete joke. Being overtly sexual isn't going to sell records anymore; Madonna perfected this and this clearly is not good territory for you. What happened to writing about things that matter? Free Xone, Together Again, title track from Velvet Rope; New Agenda from janet, etc. This album is just plain cute-sy DUMB. Come On Get Up is a nice track and All For You is kinda cute and Someone to Be My Lover is kinda interesting, but the rest is pretty disappointing. Janet's got so much potential; it's a shame."
3,Janet fan from North Carolina,"This CD is typical of Janet, but I must admit that I was a little surprised with the language, however, she speaks her mind and she is definately not shy about expressing herself. If you are not interested in adult themes, don't buy it."
4,Almost All For You,"This is a wonderful re-release of an excellent, fun album. The audio disc contains two remixes of ""Son of A Gun"", the Missy one & the P. Diddy one. But excluded from this clean version of the album is the best sensual song, ""Would You Mind"", which is more exciting than either ""China Love"" or ""Love Scene."" The J.D. remix of ""Someone to Call My Lover"" would have been a nice addition to this collection.But the real reason to purchase this album is the DVD. Packed full of Janet's videos from her years with Virgin, all the videos are included, with exception of Doesn't Really Matter, which is sorely missed. However, the rest of the videos make up for it. The energy of ""You Want This"" is a highlight of all the videos.This is perfect for any Janet fan, I advise to buy it, even if some of the stuff is left off."
3,Kinda Disappointed,"I'll make this short so I don't ramble. The majority of the songs are way to slow and what surprised me most was her language on this album. Using every word imaginable was quite shocking after growing up with radio pop hits. Miss Janet IS nasty, and she uses her first amendment in full right on this album. It will more than likly gather dust on my shelf."
3,Just okay...,"I truly enjoy and respect Janet's talent; she's one of the best pop entertainers on this planet (better than even her brothers). However, I'm gettin' a little tired of her ""sex kitten"" act. There's some great stuff on this album...notably the title track and funky ""You Ain't Right."" But after her sexual dabblings on Janet and The Velvet Rope, I was hoping she'd head in a completely different direction on this release. If I want bumping, moaning and groaning, I'll pick up Lil Kim; if I want superbly-crafted pop, I'll pick up Ms. Jackson. (Usually.) This one's a keeper, but defintely not up to the standards of Rhythm Nation or Janet."
1,Hmm..,"The only words I have to describe this comeback single from Miss J. are ""banal"",""repetitive"",""embarrasing"" and ""unoriginal"".This song was tailor-made to fit every radio format and it has succeeded.I cannot believe someone would want to be called a serious artist and offer such a teeny-bopper song as a lead off single.If I was Janet,I would be embarrased to sing this song in public.Easily the worst song of 2001,better best avoided.But you don't have to listen to me,just ask any music lover and they will tell you that this song is abysmal."
2,Yaaaawwwwn,I feel that this song is way beneath Janet. She has more talent than this. It sounds too much like Escapade to me. She looks fabulous though!
2,"Not bad, but not her best...","I rushed out on my lunch break to buy this today... I could have waited. while not an entirely bad album, it falls a little short on the Janet legacy. All For You is a strong single, but the rest of the album tends to be a let down. I guess that is why she included Doesn't Really Matter. The 'in-between-song' snips are back again, which I find a treat. However Janet's ""sampling"" is not. Her voice tends to get lost in some of the strong beats, while other songs like Son Of A Gun are torture. Janet has been working with the same producers throughout her career & always says ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Well Miss Jackson (if you're nasty) it may not be broken, but it is becoming a bit stale."
1,Not Like She Used To Be...,"All For You was a major disappointment. With over 15 new tracks on the album you would expect at least more than 2 or 3 to be good. But this album is below average.Janet doesn't have the best voice. She's not a very inspiring songwriter. But she used to entertain us with her catchy pop & r&b melodies... not anymore. She has used the same old production team for far too long now. This album could have been released in 1993.This album is not full of simple teen pop songs either. This album is just boring. Lyrically this album is much like 1997's Velvet Rope. Songs about orgasms, insecurites and relationship troubles. I'm not surprised All For You is not in the UK Top 100 albums chart anymore. A 9 week chart run is embarrassing to say the least.Unfortunately this album deserves it."
3,Good Stuff,"These are truly the sign of the times when R&B albums now have to have a warning of explicit content. Me personally, I like the clean versions of most albums, including this one. It left a good bit to be desired, but Janet Jackson's essence still strikes with emphasis."
5,Amazing Single,"Contains remixes from DJ Quik, Thunderpuss, Rockwilder and DJ Premier. My personal favorite is DJ Quik Mix. This is a GREAT single to add to your collection."
3,An Ok Effort By Janet Jackson,"Personally, I think Janet is more of a singles than an album type artist. She comes out with good singles but usually, her albums are a weak follow up and the songs on it are nothing more than fillers. This might explain why her album sales, although impressive, are no where near as high as other legendary artists like Madonna, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion and Whitney Houston, each with sales well over 150 million. Nonetheless, she has managed to gain mega success, critical acclaims, millions of fans to support her and longevity, which many artists don't have. Now getting back to the album, none of the tracks really stood out to me except for the singles and as I write this review, I can't recall any of the songs I've listened to. I know none of the Janet fans will find this review helpful but let the truth be told, and if you agree with what I've written, then don't be hesitant to click the ""Yes"" button underneath."
2,Disappointing,"Despite the stylish cover and elegant champagne color of the CD itself, the songs on this album are not worth wasting your money on. Ah, for another ""Rhythm Nation"" and ""Nasty Boys.""In this album, J.J. whispers so low that you can hardly hear her. You are always going, ""What? What?"" Her voice is so high-pitched that it disappears into the ether. The songs are too slow. There are only a couple of fast ones."
2,words cannot describe how awful it is!,"Janet and her producers are capable of making so much better music than the bland garbage on this CD. It does not have the longeivity her other albums have, and everything sounds recycled and old, it would have been a nice record for 1991, but not 2001. All For You, Trust a Try and Doesn't really Matter are the only good songs on here. That's it. Nothing else matters much, on this album, especially not the awful you aint right, love scene, would you mind and truth. Come on Get Up and When We Oooh are annoying and drag on, China Love is okay but nothing special, son of a gun is outdated and embarassing to listen to, someone to call my lover is a nice summer song, but so elementary for someone like janet, and feels so right and better days are catchy in melody, but not very special. Hopefully janet will improve on her next album"
1,This cd is a complete dissapointment,"I've been a fan of Janet's for many years but what is this? This album is a complete dissapointment! This is the juvenile, immature, and offensive content that makes me hate R&B; so much these days. I can't believe that this trash came from the same singer who gave us classics like ""Lonely"", ""Love Will Never Do"", & ""Together Again"".""Would You Mind"" gets the dishonor of being the stupidest song ever made in the history of music! >:( She sounded so desperate and I'm sickened to see one of my favorite singers tumble from the dizzying heights of The Velvet Rope down to the pits of teenybopper fluff like ""All For You"". I mean the song musically is not bad but the incredibly stupid lyrics completely ruin it!Don't buy this CD. Avoid at all costs.Get the Velvet Rope instead."
3,Completely Disappointing,"I've always loved Janet's music. I especially adored her albums RN and The Velvet Rope, because even though they dealt with serious issues, they had amazing dance songs, and couple of ballads to mellow you out...But with this album, I truly don't know what the hell Janet was thinking when making this. There are just TOO many ballads, and the worst thing about it, is that she starts of the album with them. It truly makes you want to go to sleep. The highlights of the album are definetly ""Son Of A Gun"", ""Trust a Try"", and ""China Love"". The rest, especially When We OOO should've been B-sides to singles."
3,Well Im in two minds?,"I love the stuff Janet usually does, very funky then that sexy slow voice but like VR this is going to take a while to grow on me. Yes All For You is very commercial and is really the only track on the album I can see being a single and attracting a wide audience. Sun Of A Gun is kewl too, but could never be released due the language used in it.I think Janet has lost her way a bit with this album. Very much like VR but with less appeal to a wider audiance. With time I'm sure I will love it but its not what I was expecting. Buy it if you like Janet but dont expect to fall in love with all the tracks immediately."
2,Not what I expected,"When I first listened to Janet's new CD, I was totally turned off. For one thing, when does profane language become ""artistic""? There are other ways to tell a man how you want him to ... you in a song. This just sounds nasty and mediocre. Her vocals sound absolutely terrible this time out. I guess she lost her Midas touch after Rene Elizondo stopped co-writing with Janet. ""Son Of A Gun"" is one of the most painful listens I have experienced recently. And I though listening to Robbie Williams rap was painful.Only a few cuts are worthy such as ""All For You"" and ""Doesn't Really Matter"". Even those cuts get tired after a while. Janet really needed to take some more time off because the wait for ""All For You"" wasn't worth it and the media hype (do you remember the all star tribute to her on MTV?) was baloney.If you are a hard core Janet fan, buy this, but if you love good pop music, don't even bother with this piece of garbage. Flush!!!"
3,All for fans....,"Well, after the uninspiringly singles Doesn't Really Matter and All For You, i was hoping that this album would be a breath of fresh air....The result: thankfully it's a listenable album with the ususal Terry Lewis-James Harris-Janet sound; an album of a little funk, dance, pop and R&B. Though nothing breakthrough, the album shines in several places especially with the irresistably sensual Love Scene and When We Ooh, both having the trademarked Janet sexual charm.I was also quite excited about the Carly Simon remake You're So Vain retitled with new lyrics Son of A Gun (I Betcha...). While Janet did a pretty god job with Got Til' It's Gone and Tonight's Tha Night on VR, she couldn't redo this classic...Overall, the album is highly listenable but still slightly below VR and Janet. However as with any Janet release, it's bound to sell...."
1,All for You- No Thank You!,"After waiting so long for her newest cd to drop, I was very disappointed by this album. Aside for the title track and ""Doesn't really matter"", I felt like I wasted my money. I was also surprised this album doesn't have a parental warning label with all the sexually graphic lyrics in it. I had to wait until my children were sleep to listen to it. Now you know that's bad! I didn't even want to give this cd one star, but I couldn't do this review unless I rated it.Janet, I think you'd better included your ex husband on your next effort. This album doesn't cut it for me! And from what I see in the other reviews, quite a few people agree with me!"
3,Not her best Work,This is not Janet Jackson's best work because she sells out to what is big for now instead of being an artist. This album could have been so much better but she makes songs that are sexy and made for video instead of making meaningful music. This album is a must for any Janet Jackson fan but this is clearly not her best work.
3,Where's the rest?,"I went into buying this Cd maybe expecting too much. I had never bought a Janet Jackson Cd but from her singles I was expecting more of the same. Boy was I disappointed. I skipped through the tracks over and over asking myself where's the rest? What happened to those hit you hard, upbeat, lyrics with attitude style I had heard? Needless to say other than the singles on the radio they're not there. I love Janet, and I'm happy she's still around after all these years but this album was a waste in my opinion."
5,Brilliant stuff.,"This cd has the same pop-sexuality Velvet Rope had, minus the sultry bit. Most of the cd still makes you want to get up and shake your hips to the songs. Son of a Gun, which is choppy at one point, is absolutely fabuluous in its stunningly direct smack-down musical approach. A lot of the other music is peppy and joyful, celebratory of sexual wants."
1,Disappointed in Janet....,"I have always enjoyed Janet's music in the past. Her past albums incorporated different moods covering a wide range, some fun and savy, while others were a little sexy. I was very disappointed in this album. Only three good songs, and the rest, well, almost trashy. The language was inappropriate, with a lot of sexual verbage. Wish she would have put a little class in this album. Maybe next time...."
2,"Heard ""Damita Jo"" & she's defintely stepped up on that one!!","I think ""All For You"" was a weak album & definitely isn't her best work.I've heard Janet's new album ""Damita Jo""(in stores March 30th) and was confused as to why she would release ""Just A Little While"" as a single.""Just A Little"" is a totally different sound from what the album really is... an R&B album.Some of the songs like ""Damita Jo"",""All Nite"",""My Baby"" ft. Kanye West,etc. could have easily been singles, which I hope will happen once the album is released. Forget about buying ""All For You"" and get ""Damita Jo""!!!"
2,Smut from Janet!?!,"No one can accuse me of being a prude, but.... After listening to some of the numbers on this album I was a little taken aback by the graphic nature of the lyrics. I'd think twice before buying her stuff again. I like innuendo, and suggestive lyrics that let you enjoy it without being overt, but when she fakes an orgasm in one song, talks about not having enough time to ..., talking about sucking her partner.... It just got too gross for me."
2,maybe three actual dance tracks on this album,"The rest is talk filler, slow songs (not what we expect of Janet), really dirty minded lyrics, and why is Carly Simon in here? Waste of money. I'm tempted to toss mine, it's that bad. I gave it two stars, because like I mentioned in my title, there are maybe three actual dance tracks on this album that might be worth listening to. But there's so much other bad stuff, you feel cheated."
4,This is an ADULTS ONLY recording!,"I'm no prude, but how did this CD get away without an EXPLICIT LYRICS sticker? Parents, be warned."
3,Somewhat different...but still listenable,"I have been a Janet Jackson fan since her very first album (ya'll remember ""Say You Do"" and ""Come Give Your Love To Me""). I have generally enjoyed her musical growth, her writing skills and performances. In my opinion her strongest albums, for singles values,were ""Control"", ""Rhythm Nation 1814"" and ""janet"". I enjoyed the flow and continuity of those albums. This one seems a bit haphazard, a bit too experimental in spots. Janet is definitely doing her own thing though. And you can definitely tell that she's just a bit salty at her ex-husband. The dance jams kick, the mid tempo mood cuts are definte scented candle in the bathtub slices and the do me baby ballads...well we'll see in about 9 months."
3,it gets 3 stars just because it's Janet...,"I LOVE Janet, and I love most of the albums she's done.... but ""All For You"" it's just tired. ... This album is not sexy, parts a bitter but an empty bitter... the only thing sexy about this album is the photos which are some of my very favorite Janet pictures ever. The producers that she has worked with since her control album are just getting worse and worse... they reached their peak with ""janet."" and they did a great job with ""The Velvet Rope"" but have fallen too short with this one...... ENOUGH WITH THE STEALING OF SONGS! I'm really tired of the samples, and she's done it since ""janet."" I really hope this is the last album that uses the same formula as preceeding albums... I really do love Janet, I just hope she doesn't let me down again."
2,All For Nothing.,"Janet Jackson is an AMAZING woman who has struggled with herself and her image since she was a little girl. Breaking away from her The Jackson 5 and Michael's shadow in the mid 80s, she made everyone recognize her as an artist and a musician. Rhythm Nation and The Velvet Rope were such amazing and powerful albums, while All For You was simply stupid. Janet is 36 now, and for some reason, the album sounds like it should be sung by a 26 year old, or even younger. The tile track is annoying, and most of the other tracks are just kind of thrown together and the final result is All for Nothing. The album lacks a lot of aritistic merit that The Velvet Rope had. Son of a Gun is a bad take off on the incredible Got 'til it's Gone. Carli Simon was famous in the 70s. Th 70s are long over Janet. Hopefully you'll lose Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis on your next album and go for a more electronica sound. Buy this album only if you need it to complete your Janet Jackson collection."
5,Janet at the peak of her game!,"This song is incredibly beautiful. This single is a follow-up to last year's #1 2000 Billboard smash hit ""Doesn't Really Matter."" Janet is an incredible singer and her voice sounds better than ever. The beat on this track is amazing and I can always listen to this song when I need a pick me up. It makes me feel good on a dismal day. Janet is one of the only few artists that has the power to do that for me. This is one of my favorite singles in my collection and I listen to it 10 times a day. I just can't get enough. I'm waiting feverishly for the album on Tuesday, April 24, 2001."
3,"""Some One to Call My Lover""","I know one things for sure DONT call me a lover of this album. I found that Janet shoundn't have put out an EXPLICIT verison of this cd. Son Of a Gun- This is a remake of Carly Simons YOUR SO VAIN , Janet ruined this song by the gross lyrics and she kind of just lets the song drag on forever. ""Got a nice package alright, guess Iam gonna have to ride it tonight""-all for you. Come On ! I'm beginning to think (just like her song) IT DOESENT MATTER-if she cant carrey a note, or it doesent matter if she put out an album full of garbage"
2,Put Your Clothes Back On!,"Janet needs to put her clothes back on and begin singing good songs again. I only bought this for the DVD video compiliation and good thing too as the music on ALL FOR YOU is pathetic. Since Velvet Rope was percieved to be depresing, this CD was concocted to proove that Janet was a party grryl. Well it didn't work. We can see right through you. The only song I like on the disc is Feels So Right.I won't be buying any more Janet Jackson CD's until she can stop being a shallow poser and start being the stong opinionated woman we all learned to love on Control and Rhythm Nation."
1,NOT What America Needs Now,I really feel let down by this CD. I never thought my family or I would hear such filth come out of her mouth. Why can't she just rely on her talent? The arrogance of her words is an attack on the values of our society.
3,An OK effort,"Most of the songs on this cd are simply boring. A few are downright hilarious. Frankly, the orgasmic sounds were done back in the day by Donna Summer to much more interesting effect. But I did LOVE ""Son of A Gun."" That had a groovy beat. I seriously miss the Janet of ""Control"" days though. b"
3,I'll give it props for having nice dance songs,"The dance songs on this CD are catchy and have a lot of melody and soul, but the music sounds really dated and unoriginal compared to her previous albums, and she's singing too much about sex. Check out something she released before this new image janet put out."
3,only half the songs are good,"the best songs on this album are All For You, Come on Get Up, When We Oooh, Trust a Try, Son of a Gun, Feels so Right, Doesn't Really Matter. And most of these sound a bit outdated for 2001, but are catchy in melody anyhow and worth a listen."
4,Okay Ms. Janet....,"I am a fan of Janet. She is the one Jackson that is not weird or just plain laughable. My favorite cd of hers is ""Janet"". I went out and got this, extremely excited. I think it is pretty good. It is not the best and not what I thought it could be, but it was good. I don't like all of the silly interludes. Some of the cursing seemed out of place and forced. Almost like when you are in high school trying to act ""grown"" in front of your friends. Then she gets ""sexy"". For some reason, it just didn't sound sexy to me. Was she trying to top ""Anytime, Anyplace""? Well, she didn't. Some of the lyrics were just too simplistic for me. ""maybe we'll meet at a bar, he'll drive a funky car......"". My 5 year old could have done that. In the end, it is Janet. I'd rather see her than Miss Spears anyday. At least she is honest about who she is and what she does. I respect that."
4,Janet Jackson : All For You DVD Edition,"DISC 1 : Janet's CLEAN ALL 4 U ALBUM ON C.D. (includes 2 bonus remixes of "" son of a gun "" feat. CARLY SIMON , MISSY ELLIOT , P.DIDDY , AND SHAGGY ) ( track listing doesn't feature "" would u mind "" ) .DISC 2 : A special limited edition DVD of all Janet's videos from the albums JANET. , VELVET ROPE , AND ALL 4 U . Bonus features include : a behind the scenes look at all the albums , MTV icon performence of "" all 4 u "" , a mix it up/playlist , and seperate sections of all the albums and thier videos .I own this item and would recomend it for any HARD CORE J.J. fan !!!!!! I could have done without the C.D. though ."
3,A Different Janet -- All For You -- Explicit Lyrics Warning,"Ok, where should I start. In general this is a good CD, however it does have its problems.1.)I believe there should be an Explicit Lyrics Warning on this CD. There is one song in particular that makes the warning warented. Tack 9 ""Would You Mind"" is very adult and suggestive. Two other tracks are questionably explicit.2.) There is a lot of conversation that I believe is a distraction not to mention problem on the CD. A lot of un-needed talk.Dispite the problems that Janet's ""All For You"" CD has, I think this is a nice ""atempt"" by Janet musically. With ""All For You,"" we hear a softer and very romantic Janet. At the same time Janet adds her signature edge that makes her who she is.Janet all grown up! Nice atempt at a romance CD. Leave it to Janet to give romance a kick start.""All For You,"" not for young fans."
2,she has changed,"This CD was very dissapointing to me. Usually artists improve in each cd. That is not the case here. Janet's music used to be more meaningfull and it showed off her vocal talents. This CD is full of overproduced songs like ""all for you"" that show no creativity. If you plan on buying this cd and have high expectations, I'm telling you now you may be dissapointed."
4,all for who,"big deal janet talking about sex, big deal everybody talks about sex, and coming out the closet now anyway so what's so shocking about this."
3,Good but not Great,"I must admit, I've never been a big "" Janet Jackson Fan"", when I first heard the hit singles "" All for you"" and "" Doesn't really matter"" I went and bought the album, but I was really disapointed. First of all the "" Interludes"" are a waste of space and time. Second of all the songs "" Would you Mind"",When we oooo"", "" Son of a gun"" are horrible songs. "" Would you..."" talks all about sex and how her lover touches her. The songs "" All for you"" "" Someone to call my lover"" "" Come on get up"", and "" Doesn't really matter remix"" are worth buying the album for. These songs are hipp, and have the best party beats. The Remix of "" Doesn't..."" is simply the best. It is long and great to dance to. If you are a Fan, I advise you to buy it because it truly is Janet."
3,only partially for me,"When I heard the title track ""All for You"", I knew i had to buy this CD. When I got it I flipped through to the tracks I had already heard (""You Ain't Right, ""Someone to Call my Lover"", and ""Doesn't Really Matter""), all of which are fun, danceable, pop songs. However, as I began to listen to other tracks such as ""China Love"" and ""Would You Mind"", I was totally disgusted. These carnally-obsessed lyrics are completely unessesary and gross. This CD should have had a Parental Advisory sticker slapped on it to begin with. I am really sorry for all of the preteens who purchased this album- the thought of 10 and 11-year-olds listening to this CD sickens me. This is the 1st and last Janet CD I will buy."
2,Whoops!,"Just saw Tony Markham's correction (AFTER I included mine, natch). I just don't wanna look like I'm harping on him here!"
5,"This is a good cd, as good as any she has made! Try it.","Well first off I would like to say that modern music in general is in a big depression. It's all becoming a game of who can mass produce a hit so we can all get rich faster kind of thing. So there;s no use complaining about that, if you don't like quick computerized popular kind of music then you will just have to wait for this phase to pass. But if you want to hear anything but bach you will have to content yourself with the stuff that comes out. As for the vulgar lyrics, well I am an intelligent thinking being and guess what, I am not scared! WOW! You don't have to coddle me with your music, and if everyone in the world is so prudish then well ,maybe the lyrics should be MORE vulgar to wake ya'all up! As far as the cd itself goes it happens to be a lot like Janet you guys remember it dont you? Well this one is very similiar. I like it and I just think it shows her personality. Well there you go. I Think it's very good."
3,"Not her best, but quite catchy...","Janet is at that point in her career where none of her singles will be considered a bomb...However I do agree that this is clearly not her best work. Obviously a very used sample (listen to ""Glow of Love"", by Change & Luther Vandross), but I think the song was made to be light-hearted and fun. The first few times I heard this song, I really loved it, and now I can't even wait for the album to come out. April 24..."
3,"Janet's brings out a new side in Janet, A Bad Side","When I first heard this album, I was like, OMG. I was very surprised about the lyrics that Janet had sung for this album. Even though the lyrics can get little explicit, Janet still makes a great album. The best songs are:All For You, Doesn't Really Matter, Someone To Call My Lover and You Ain't Right.All the rest of the songs are mediocre. I liked Janet's other albums but this album really is not for me. My friend let me borrow the album and when I heard it, I decided not to get the album at all. Songs like: Love Scene, Son Of A Gun, Would You Mind, When We Oooo and Trust A Try should make this album PARENTAL ADVISORY. If you're a die hard Janet fan, get the album. If not, don't even bother looking at the CD on the rack."
2,Bland Bland Bland,"So compeltely dissapointed in this album and Janet's work lately that I don't even know what to write. I became a fan with Rhythm Nation and was completely in love with her work when I got ""Janet"" with its beautiful combination of melodies, funk and rhythms. But this one sounds like she's trying to get young and fresh too hard. The lyrics sound so silly at times that you have to double check the linear notes to see if she really wrote them. Aside from ""Doesn't Really Matter"", ""Son of a Gun"" and ""When we Ooh"" everything else is very forgetable.Let's hope she's a little more inspired next time."
5,JANET DEFINETELY HAS IT!,"WELL, YES I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT JANET'S NEW SINGLE ""ALL FOR YOU"" IS REALLY CHEESY AND VERY BUBBLEGUM BUT ISN'T THAT WHAT SHE IS SUCCESSFUL FOR? AS A FAN,I DONT CARE IF SHE DOESN'T COMMERCIALLY SELL GOOD BUT LISTENING TO SUCH FEEL GOOD AND CAREFREE SONGS LIKE ""ALL FOR YOU CAN INFLICT POSITIVE VIBES WITHIN THE SELF AND I'M THANKFUL FOR JANET'S MUSIC COZ SHE REALLY MAKES MY DAY. THE SONG MAY NOT BE INNOVATIVE ENOUGH BUT LET'S JUST RESPECT JANET FOR HER MUSIC AND IT WILL COME THAT SHE WILL MATURE INTO A SERIOUS ARTIST BUT IN THE MEANTIME, SHE'S HAVING FUN AND BETTER DAYS ARE AHEAD!"
4,JJ COMIN' ATCHA!,Janet comes back to us after Doesn't Really Matter with All for You. She goes with the same vibe that she wants you to be happy and have fun. She gives you that good vibe and makes you feel like you're #1 on her list! Can't wait for the album.
4,"Great song, mediocre remix","I love this song. It has to be one of Janets best, I just want to get up and move to its great beat and sexy lyrics. This is one of the few singles I can find anywhere so it was a good purchase, a great find.The remixes leave something to be desired. I enjoy remixes that mix up the orginal beat and lyrics and dont change too much of the original versions elements. The remixes here are sometimes very different from the song and I usually enjoy Thunderpuss remixes, but this one seemed lacking. Maybe it is just me, but I think there could be better remixes made of this song then are offered here. It is still worthy of a purchase, a darn good CD overall."
5,All for Us!,"Janet re-releases the ""All For You"" cd with some extra versions of ""Son of a Gun"", but its the videos that make this buy special. Janet is known for her great dancing and incredible videos and the dvd extra is chock full of those. The only video missing is the ""Doesn't Really Matter"" video from ""The Klumps"" movie but other than that, all of Janet's Virgin era videos are here. If you are a Janet fan, this is a must for your collection."
3,Unhappy,"Well, first of all I would like to say the DVD is great. However, the CD is not that great. I purchased it for the 2 new versions of Son of A Gun, but since it is edited and the cover does not say that then the songs are cut up. I love the 2 new versions, but I do not want to hear blank ""skips"" throughout the songs. It is still a great set, but the CD could have been left out."
2,A FEW GOOD SONGS ON A LESS THAN MEMORABLE ALBUM,"I LISTENED TO JANET'S NEW ALBUM ""ALL FOR YOU"" IN A FRIEND'S CAR AND I MUST SAY I WAS PRETTY SUPRISED AND DISSAPOINTED. JANET, WHILE NOT A REMARKABLE SINGER, HAS ALWAYS MANAGED TO RELEASE REALLY GOOD ALBUMS...EVEN 1997'S ""VELVET ROPE"" WAS PRETTY GOOD..VERY GOOD COMPARED TO THIS ALBUM...THE ALBUM LACKS ANY REAL EMOTIONAL DEPTH..IT SOUNDS AS IF JANET HAS RUN OUT OF THINGS TO SAY SO NOW SHE JUST MOANS A LOT...THE ALBUM DOES CONTAIN A FEW GOOD TUNES THOUGH..THE TITLE TRACK, ""DOEN'T REALLY MATTER"", AND EVEN ""SON OF A GUN"" WITH CARLY SIMON RAPPING...GOD HELP US...ARE ALL GOOD..BUT THE REST OF THE ALBUM IS JUST SIMPLY TOO BORING..BUT IT'S ALRIGHT JANET..I'LL STILL TAKE YOU AS MY WIFE...IF YOU WANT A GOOD JANET ALBUM STICK W/ 1993'S ""JANET""."
4,All For Me,"As a pop artist you either change with the times or you are so on the next VH1 ""Where are they now?"" It must be hard to make each album better than the last one. Janet Jackson has delivered great pop songs since the 80's and makes no exception with her latest album. The majority of the album is pure Janet - fun, energetic, and danceable. However,there are a few songs we can do without. Son of a Gun w/Carly Simon, simply put, just does not work. Sampling the song would have sufficed but having Carly rapping is just plain wrong. Overall, if you are a long-term Janet fan like me, you will dig her latest effort."
4,Outstanding!,"I'll confess - the first time I heard the album, I thought, GARBAGE. Pure garbage, with a decent song or two. But to be honest, I've never liked a JJ album when I hear it first. Now that I've gotten the opportunity to really listen to it, I can say that it is TRULY a gem. Yeah, it's got one ballad too many but overall, All For You is rock solid.Now, some people are sayng that it's not happy enough. I know she said it was a happy, upbeat album, and it delivers for the most part. Sure, there are a few dark songs (You Ain't Right, Truth, Son Of A Gun and Trust A Try) but the rest is very carefree and happy!I don't think it's gonna be a critics favorite - I actually see the critics ripping it to shreds. But the truth is, it's a damned good album. Seriously. China Love is a pure gem, Trust A Try is mind-blowing, Come On Get Up will make you want to do just that, and Son Of A Gun is so on point it'll make you shudder. 4.75/5 stars!!!!!!"
3,Response to Brian,"What on this song is innovative? What on this song stands up to the ""standards she sets for herself,"" as you would say? It sounds like it was written by whoever writes stuff for Britney or Christina. And yes, ""Velvet Rope"" was a failure. You say it was innovative but I think you mistake running out of ideas and trying something unpopular for innovation. Janet sounds best when her songs have fun hooks but thick musical textures. ""Velvet Rope"" and ""All For You"" fall short of that standard."
4,Son Of A Gun,"It took me a number of listens to get into Janet's new cd, but I have to admit it's pretty good. Better than ""The Velvet Rope"" and ""Janet"". I think she returns with some catchy upbeat songs that have memorable melodies like ""All For You"", ""You Ain't Right"", ""Come On Get Up"", ""When We Oooo"" and ""Doesn't Really Matter"". Particularly interesting is ""Son Of A Gun"" with Carly Simon. At first I didn't care for it, but after a few listens I like what Janet, Jimmy and Terry and Carly did with it. ""All For You"" should put Janet back into having some Top 40 hits again and possibly some new fans as well. Let's see how her brother, Michael does this year with his new cd. The competition is on!"
2,yawn!,"Janet's Album will sell. Not because it is good, but because Janet is a star and has top level producers. I listened to this cd more than once, but I have yet to find something that makes me want to say it's worth its money. I find it boring and flat. Whatever happened to the Janet I used to love? This CD sounds like she's biting off of her own copies and is lacking of the unique sounds she used to get folks with. I find this CD absolutely disappointing."
3,I've heard better from Janet,"This album is not too bad. The song ""Son of A Gun"" is a classic Janet track in my book. However, with that said the album really doesn't have much else to offer. All For you is a standard dance track that is somewhat catchy. If you don't have any Janet albums I would definitely recommend this cd over her latest effort ""Damita Jo""."
2,boring!!!,"I have loved Janet's past albums, but this one was just BORING!!!. I stopped listening to it a week later. I miss the Janet album and Velvet Rope was much better than this bland piece of work. Janet needs a new sound badly!!!"
2,"janet's good, but this isnt that great!","so u expect some good pure Rnb', with a twist of janet?but this!...its pretty bad..well for the standards she set herself. the only good songs are all 4 you,son of a gun, cmon get up, better days,someone to call my lover and doesnt really matter....the rest?...all sex songs....they tend to get boring after you hear them a few times....this is definatly not her best work. im wainting on her next to be better."
5,"""WHO""......Janet......Miss Jackson if you're Nasty!!!!! :)","What else can I say...You gotta be a true Janet fan to get this cd!! The bonus song ""Who"" is AWESOME! It definately should be on the US version of 'All For You' also. This entire CD is one of Janet's best...so if you don't feel like spending big bucks just for one extra song, you HAVE to get the US version...but ""Who"" is definately worth the $30+, it's an awesome song, upbeat and pumping!!...oh, and by the way, did I mention it's by Janet Jackson...need I say more?!?!?!'All For You' Japan Version feat. ""Who"" Bonus Track....*******"
2,It's kind of boring...,"I must admit I liked ""All 4 U"" the song, but I got bored with the rest of the songs. There was no need for those lame interludes, it made the album draaaaaaaaggg. Since I found the title song fun and lively, I was expecting the album to be the same, but unfortunately it wasn't. Why curse and simulate sexual situations? Didn't Madonna do that already in the early 90's, and has moved on since then? I would advice Janet to do the same. By the way, where's the parental advisory label? There are teens and even pre-teens listening to this album."
4,a stronger more mature Janet,"This album proves that Janet is much more mature now than back in the ""Control"" days. She does not want to ""wait a while"" any longer. There is a song on the album that is the exact opposite of ""Let's Wait A While"".However, I like this album better than ""The Velvet Rope"" because the mood seems to be much lighter than ""The Velvet Rope"", which was her most personal album."
3,Where's the Warning Label!,"I've always been a big Janet Jackson fan so, naturally, Ibought this CD. It's basically Janet but... she.. [is].. so...[explicit]?"
4,Got the cd early,"Writing this on April 20th. I got the Janet cd early because a store in my neighborhood started selling it early. It's a good cd, somewhere between 93's Janet and 97's velvet rope. My problem with the velvet rope was that it followed the same formula as janet. Almost every song on the VR had a similar song on janet. Got till it's gone = That's the way love goes, I get so lonely = anytime anyplace and so on. Not so with this album. It goes it's own route and comes off nicely. I don't really care for the first song, i don't know why, maybe it will grow on me, but it gets better from there. I like every track from 3 to 11. I haven't really listened to the rest of it yet cause I want to take my time and enjoy it. I think their using some knew production techniques cause the cd gives my stereo a sound I didn't know it possessed. Anyway. It's janet. If you are a janet fan, you are going to like it. so when it comes out on the 24th, go buy it. Got it? Good. Peace."
3,"Good idea, Bad compilation...","I have Janet's latest DVD ""From Janet To Damita Jo"" pre-ordered because it's what I've been waitiing for all along...a successor to ""Design of A Decade"" DVD. I can see where she was going with this CD/DVD combo but it doesn't work. Sure it's good for collectors but here's the problem. The CD is not the original one with Explicit Lyrics. Why wouldn't they just have an enhanced CD of ""All For You"" when it came out with all the videos from the album? Then just wait for ""From Janet To Damita Jo"" where it has ALL of her videos from Virgin Records and some Special Features (this one has hardly any) to boot. I don't see the need to get another ""All For You"" album especially if it's not even explicit lyrics and there aren't any special features on the DVD. Order Janet's latest offering ""From Janet To Damita Jo"" if you want to get your FULL MONEY'S WORTH."
1,Just another BUBBLE-GUM offering by Miss J!,"C'mon fellas, lets face it, the last single she had, taken off the soundtrack was way better than this piece of crappy bubble-gum jam. One of the reviewers' so right about Jam and Lewis, they should consider gettin' into Puffy's ""running-outta ideas"" camp. Janets lucky cuz shes been on the scene long enough to fool every buyer into making the purchase. get REAL u guys, get wit' the program and go against the grain!"
3,"Not the Best, Not the Worst","The album has it's moments, but overall, it's nothing too terribly new or exciting. I would recommend it to Janet fans, but not necessarily anyone new to her material. Start with the older stuff first before you work your way up to this. Also, be warned that the overly-sensitive or very young may not appreciate some of the tracks on this cd (language, concepts, etc.). This is not the bubblegum that made Janet famous. It's grittier and, yes, a little nasty at times (a reflection of her current state of mind, which I personally have no problem with because a true artist/creative person tends to produce material that reflects what's going on inside themselves). In any event, not a bad effort on the part of Miss Jackson, just a little run-of-the-mill (for her regular listeners/fans), in my opinion."
3,Good but not Great!,"This is not her best album. I was hoping for so much more! ""Janet"" and ""Control"" are still her best albums to date. After listening to all of the tracks I really only fell in love with 4 songs.When we ooo (mid tempo love song with great lyrics) China Love (nice slow sexy song) Trust a Try (sounds like a 2001 update of the song ""If"") All for you (upbeat party song, dance club fave)I had some trouble making out most of the lyrics because the music and production drowned out her voice. I also wanted more up tempo summertime songs. Overall, the album could have been better. However, if you are a true Janet fan you have to suck it up and buy the album."
2,"Big fan of her, but this one did not connect for me","Love Janet and big fan for long time, but this one was mixed with various styles and tunes that did not fit what I expected from her."
3,I wouldn't say it's her best album,"This is not her best album, she has nothing new to offer musically and I was disappointed with this album, but if you want catchy pop music with dance jams with a dirty twist to it, buy it, but don't expect another control, rhythm nation, janet or velvet rope because this album is not as good as those."
2,Janet really blew it with this one!,"I am a big fan of Janet but what on earth is this?It stinks! This album is just endless thin voiced dross that showcases none of the talent and power that Janet has brought over the last 18 years. All that this is is just commercial pap that was made for the 'current day' trends on TRL and vanishes into the history books in a year or two.Nothing except the title track is memorable. The worst is ""WOuld yOU mInd"" which is just a pile of aural manure. The moaning and groaning is gross and classless.I am a big fan of Janet but I really did not like this album at all. Sorry Janet but not this time. Hopefully she'll be back on her feet on her next album."
2,so bad,"I'm a huge janet fan, but this CD was just so bad, that I was forced to go buy britney spears, destiny's child and n sync albums and listen to old school janet during spring 2001 when I should have been enjoying janet's brand new album, but it was very disappointing. All For You was a great track, I wish I could say the same for the album but it was awful."
3,This could of been better.,"The Velvet Rope is and will probably be Janet's most thoughtful, personal, and best album to date. I didn't expect AFY to be as good as TVR but I was disappointed that Janet went a step back musically. The only songs I was happy with was ""Come on Get Up"",""China Love"", ""Trust a Try"", and ""Better Days"". All of the other ones was musically something Janet already did and could of placed along side any of previous albums (Her previous albums are good, but she should move forward instead of trying to repeat her past works). I love Janet and ""All For You"" is ok to dance to but compared to her previous work it seems kind of shallow."
2,Just not a very good mystery,"Miss Zukas is sort of interesting as a stereotypical librarian, but this is one of those mysteries that goes on way too long and ends up nowhere with a resolution that makes no sense and is impossible to understand. I still don't know why some of the folks got killed. I took a chance on this author. Ms Dereske is now firmly in my literary rear view mirror. Save yo money."
2,Couldn't care about this unlikable character,"Prim and proper librarian's orderly life is disturbed by the murder of a transient in the library.One of the least likable or interesting characters I've ever tried to read about, an absolutely stereotypical librarian who has to have everything in its place and relates better to books than people. Dereske does a great job of characterizing Helma Zukas to the reader, but she is so impossible to like that who cares? I got a quarter of the way through and essentially nothing other than the murder had happened, so I quit."
5,Brother John,Great movie . Leaves you guessing . If you are a Sidney Poitier fan you will love this movie.
1,A Masterpiece? More like a total waste of 90 minutes,"An entire movie of Poitier with a blank stare and one-word answers.He was supposed to be an ANGEL? Since when do angels need passports or have criminal records? The credits were rolling and all I could think was, ""What the hell did I just watch?""The only thing this movie made me feel was being ashamed of how white people treated black people back then.Total thumbs down."
1,Why pay for wrong information,"I am the programs manager for a national academic organization. Someone just called me and quoted a section in this book that claims our organization offer scholarships to girls and women from the U.S. and Canada. Totally not true. It really bothers me when people put out false or made up information and the unsuspecting general public pays good money for it. Clearly, this book was not well researched and was probably just copied from other not-well-researched sources."
1,disappointing...,I returned the original and it's replacement as each one required sanding. I also found one for half the price that was good to go.
4,It's a rolling pin.,This is a functional rolling pin. Feels a lot like the one my grandma has. Pretty easy to clean. Heavy enough to do the job. Not really sure what else to say about a rolling pin.
3,Decent but costly,"I was able to find similar performing products in my local market for less than 6 dollars after taxes. It is costly online hence buy this only if are not able to find this locally.The product is good, well built and works well. No qualms against the product quality. Have been using this to make wheat flatbreads for last 2 months and seems to be working good for now."
4,Gift,This was a Christmas gift for someone else. It arrived in plenty of time before Christmas. It seemed to be in good working order though I never used it due to it being a gift.
3,"Fine, but a little disappointing","I know the product description gives measurements, so I should have known, but this rolling pin seemed so small to me; really too small to be that effective. Also, it was really light, which made it seem flimsy and as if it would be less effective. It also seems to me that dough would get stuck between the handles and the pin, as there is a relatively large gap. All in all, although there's nothing wrong with it per se, I wasn't thrilled with this pin."
5,If you own only one book about women's health.....,"Buy this book. The focus is on ""health,"" not illness, and the issues addressed are broader than those which bring you to the doctor's office. From Airbags to Zinc, the topics are laid out alphabetically, making answers to specific questions easy to find. I find myself looking up one thing and being drawn to other sections of the book. I've never opened the book without learning something new. For women of a certain age who wonder ""Am I the only one who feels like this?"" and ""Should I be worrying about this?"" this is a great book to have on your reference shelf."
2,This reference is oversimplistic. Check it out in a store before buying it online,"This book is written much differently than the Harvard Med Guide to Men's Health (which is an excellent book and a good read.) I am a health professional and I was disappointed to find that this book is indexed for use as an alphabetical reference and it is written in (too) simplistic language. Moreover, the explanation of where the research and conclusions come from (large research studies like the Nurse's Health Study, etc.) is absent. As a desk reference, this is a weak resource and as a comprehensive summary of Harvard Med conclusions, it also lacks cohesive, integrated organization."
5,Very informative,I borrowed an older copy from a friend to look something up and thought this would be a great book to have in the house. I know you can look anything up you want online but I still like having a book to read up on. This newer version is much nicer.
2,Not worth it,"This book is very general and not at all specific if you want to delve into disease and such. Overall, its not worth the price."
2,Gelatin inside,First of all I didn't like that the capsules are made out of gelatin so the product is not vegetarian. There's also no need to order online since you can buy the product in almost any supermarket. Of course it's hard to proof it helps to prevent colds but maybe it's helping psychologically. At least I got sick even though taking the capsules starting in fall through winter. I guess it's just one of the things we actually really don't need.
5,Very effective,"Nature's Way brand is consistently of excellent quality. Echinacea and Goldenseal helped fight an oncoming cold I was exposed to in a public place. I was at a salon for two hours surrounded by coughing and sneezing stylists near me. My stylist did not have any cold symptoms, but as soon as I left I picked up E and G drops then ordered the capsules. I felt swollen glands, and nasal congestion, but the drops and capsules stopped any further progression.This product has worked for me many times, and I highly recommend it if you hate getting sick!"
1,Didn't help,"Saw on the news how this product works. Maybe being sick a day was too late, or maybe dorsnt work on the virus I had. Didn't help at all."
3,A Southern Romp,"This is the type of film you watch on a steaming hot summer day with a cool glass of sickenly sweetened ice tea in one hand and a wicker fan in the other. The power struggle between the two cotton rivals did not interest me as much as the tension between the Sicilian cotton business man played by Wallach and his rival's young and almost mentally retarded wife Baby Doll. Karl Malden's performance as the frustrated husband is very well done but I really get a kick out of Wallach's devilish performance. Especially the scene where he's chasing Baby Doll through the house with his riding whip (no horse mind you) swigging a jug of spiked lemonade trying to make the house appear haunted. His character is a master at psychological manipulation. I found the ending unsatisfying and the portrayl of the blacks as dehumanizing. If I were Southern I'd be offended by this film. But for those who like to study films, this is an interesting one to look at."
3,Fairly Good Condition,"It was perfect except for the puncture wound in the back of it. It looked like the top right corner had been hit with a box cutter. I already knew that I wouldn't be getting a DVD in the best condition possible, so I guess I got what I paid for. The DVD wasn't damaged, which was the most important part."
1,Taste like can food,I order this product based on other people's reviews but very disappointed on it. Nobody in the family likes it.
3,Not what I expected~ sigh~,"I am used to the Norwegian COLD smoked salmon, still rather clear in color, on the raw side.. ya know. Lox.I think i might have not read into this correctly, but the items came, far from expectation. They feel and taste like canned salmon. The vacuum seal packed in the flavors, I guess. The oil preserved the salmon well, but it was salty and taste overcooked. I cannot tell if it's smoked or just cooked till dry.I won't order again. But i can see how this would be called smoked salmon. I guess on the good side, i am an innovative cook, so smoked salmon pasta here we come! I think these would go well in dips too.Just not what i wanted."
5,Excellent Smoked Salmon,"This was fantastic smoked salmon, and the quantity was generous compared toother on-line smoked salmon retailers."
3,Less than wonderful.,"More like kippered herring in taste. I like a bit of kippered herring, but not pounds of it. Might just be me."
2,You get what you pay for...,Cute little noisemaker only. You will get a ticket if you rely on this device. Slow to respond to radar on the highway. Really good at detecting automatic door openers though.
4,It costs money you spent on it,"It works.If cop has a radar I know it,Im sure that couple times it saved my money.Bad thing is that it works only in open areas,if you have a wall or buildings it not gonna help you.But as I sad,it costs money you spent!"
3,How to defeat poverty and save the world,"Mr. Stiglitz seems to think that is the responsibility of US citizens and corporations to eliminate poverty throughout the world, even if it means that American Corporations would lose money, American consumers would pay higher prices and even it it's necessary to file a case against the USA in the WTO courts. Most of his criticisms of the World Bank and the IMF aeem to be essentially true, at least to me, though they may be somewhat exaggerated. Socialists, one-worlders, and altruists will love this DVD set. Conservatives should listen, as I did, because it's always a good idea to see what the opposition is thinking and proposing."
3,Not quite as pictured,"The silver scarab pendant I recieived does not have the darker coloration; it's entirely silver in color. I was also expecting it to be a bit weightier... the pendant is very, very lightweight. I was expecting a bit more rugged pendant. This scarab pendant would be nice for someone wanting a very lightweight, elegant pendant. It's a decent buy, and the shipping was fast."
3,Bottle had leaked and only received half,I was disappointed because when I received the two bottles they were not leak proof and had leaked during shipment causing about half of the contents to be left. I think the product should have had some type of seal to prevent this from happening.
4,Old School,Some Of the Song Cut Off Before It Get To The End Of Record. I Would Not Buy This Album For No Price
5,Ultimate Millie,"This is Millie doing what she does best--telling it like it is.I have been a fan for awhile and she always seems to amaze me.She is definitely an entertainer worth having in your collection.If you think her recordings are something, wait 'til you see herlive. This recording shows you just what Millie is capable of."
5,Different than your average radio station,"very nice cd with a compilation of various instrumental songs used in the series. If you are a person who likes to listen to songs with beats, or sambas, with an urban twist, this is a great cd for you. I like this cd, some of it is really upbeat and fun"
5,One of the most beautiuful Albums out there,Marc Lavoine has a beautiful masculine voice. His songs contain gorgeous and romantic melodies. The lyrics (if you understand french) are so beautiful and touching. This album is a gem that a lot of people are not aware of.
2,disappointing,I found this book to be silly. It is not really a mystery. It focuses heavily on whether the central characters like one another or not. And this reader did not care!
1,Double Disgusting,"This book actually won an award? I will give it the Useless Profanity Award. What the *%#!@ does the ""_"" word and all the ""g-d d--ns"" have to do with a good mystery? I threw it in the trash after Chapter 3. I consider myself an average reader but the profanity was wa-a-a-ay too distracting. I wasted my money and my time. Hopefully this review will save yours."
3,Delays,"The molding is nice, no complain, but it was one week delay. I don't think the seller, Restorers, carries the product line by itself."
4,"Slow? yes, but it lingers sweetly with you for a long time","Personally, I enjoy ""slow"" movies- you get to savor the atmosphere and the characters- why the rush all the time? I watched this over Winter Break along with many other foreign movies and this is the one that really has really stayed with me.Take an evening and just sit back, relax, and enjoy this quiet little film that steps into the lives of the inhabitants of an isolated island on election day. Watch the main characters grow as they encounter new attitudes and ideas."
4,something really different,"This story seems very American. An election in which no one seems to care. The fascinating thing to me is how like Joseph and Mary the two protagonists seem to be. Instead of wandering around Bethlehem in search of a room, the woman in her ancient customary garb and her protective soldier wander around a very Biblical landscape in search of votes. Anyone who thinks Iran is part of some hyped up axis of evil needs to see this movie. We are the same in as many ways as we are different."
1,Could have used some editing,"I really wanted to like this film. It did raise some interesting points about society and humanity. I'll even agree with some of the other reviewers that the more subtextual approach could be easily missed by those expecting a hollywood-style movie. Yet the film was really slow. There are repeated periods of protracted landscape shots that add nothing to the movie. This would have been a much better film had it been half as long as it was. I wouldn't consider it a comedy, as it wasn't the least bit funny."
2,Watch it by chewing energy bars constantly,"Again, a simple-minded movie like ""The Wind Will Carry Us"". This time, on a remote Island belongs to Iran. You have to arm yourself with extra energy and spirit, especially A PATIENT MIND to keep on watch and finish this film. You can also to pretend how deep instead of how shallow you might be by appreciating or by not knowing how to appreciate this film. Knowing any marriage with a wife or husband so annoyingly blabbings all the time? Or sitting in a classroom trying very hard to listen to a lousy professor to blahblahblah? Or try to become a drifter to pick up someone's chewing gum to chew some non-exist taste out of it? Well, if you could appreciate this film, you should get ""The Wind Will Carry Us"", it definitely won't disappoint you. God Bless."
1,Where's the rest of the book?,"I have the same complaint as the last reviewer. I waited a long time for this book to arrive and my mouth hung open in shock when I saw the puny ""mini me"" of a book I received. There is no index to tell you which solver problem addresses which content area in math, and there aren't enough pages to make this a worthwhile curriculum book. As the last reviewer advised, don't buy this. Look for the full-size edition. The ISBN is 1-57232-435X."
1,book received did not match book advertised,"The ""workbook"" edition I received was nothing like the more comprehensive collection of problem solving activities I was expecting. (The cover also does not match the cover of the book advertised.) If you order this, be aware that you will receive only 45 activities, based on animal themes. Instead of a focus on math and problem solving, the kids are directed to draw animals such as a stag, a doe, a rooster, and a bull. I'm sure the math will be completely lost in the unreasonable drawing tasks. Bottom line, check the ISBN of the more comprehensive book of reproducible problem solving tasks with the same title and don't bother to order this."
1,"Very misleading, and a rip-off","The Product Details clearly state: Paperback: 48 pages. I wish I had seen that before I ordered it.This appears to be a workbook for the actual book which my Wife saw in a store and asked me to order. The picture does not match the book cover, which states ""Grade 2 workbook"". 60% of each page is a box to draw in, 25% lines to write on, and the other 15% (max) is 1-3 sentence questions. Do yourself a favor and give your kids a blank piece of drawing paper and ask them silly questions like ""how many mittens do 3 spiders require?"" then have them draw the spiders. 12 dollars buys a lot of blank paper!"
1,Item does not match description,"This is my first comment/review ever as a loyal Amazon customer and 15 year classrooom teacher. I ordered the grades 1,2, and 3 books (shipped overnight), expecting the 192 page blackline master books I had previously owned in my first grade classroom. What I received tonight is just awful....three flimsy 46 pp (each) workbooks, that do not necessarily focus on math (for example: In the grade 2 book, ""Here is one animal whose name begins with 'ch'""....????????? I am SO disappointed that I cannot seem to find the original 192 pp books. Do not buy these books from Amazon!"
1,Not as advertised-disappointed,"I ordered Read It Draw It Solve It Grade 2. The product information said this contained 180 activities, one for each day of the year. It does NOT. It contains 45 pages. It is not as advertised. Don't waste your money. I should have listened to the other reviews instead of taking a chance on this product. It's going back for a refund."
2,Cute but......,"The holes and slots are too big, a lot of the little broken clumps of litter fall right through and scatter in the pan. I think if the holes were smaller and slots much thinner, it would capture any of the smaller broken pieces when cleaning the pan."
1,Don't waste your time and money.,"I bought this book, oh boy.. what a dope. Totally useless. Microsoft Excel help has done way better than this book. I would never ever recommand anyone to even look at the book, forget about buying."
2,Basic information organized for numerical analysis,"I didn't find what I expected which was examples and guidance for using Excel to solve engineering problems. Instead, I found a book that illustrates how to solve problems using numerical methods: simple regression, polynomial equations, simultaneous equations, comparing economic alternatives, and time value of money.While the content may be useful, it is already well documented in the Excel User Guides and Help files."
4,"Not bad, but it is painful!","I have severe acne, so I bought this to completely clean my faceafter the whole-day work. But I had used it for about a month, tow or threetimes a week. I feel painful all the time when I use it.And after wash my face, I felt a little dry on my face."
3,Okay,"As a cleansing mud it's too drying and irritating without apparent effects. The mud is really harsh on sensitive skins, and also problematic on my oily skin in fall times. It won't clear pores at all, but my skin does feel clean. Well...there are so many stuff better than this. Won't buy again."
5,forever fan of the mud,"I have been using the mud since I was 14, and now it is almost 10 years. It does clean my pores and take away all the dirts"
4,active mud for face,I have used products from other stores but I keep coming back to Borghese. My skin doesn't break out or feel dried out. I love this product and would recommend to any fair skinned red head such as myself. (Joe's wife)
5,great mask,The mask is really great and makes my face clear and bright. It's just a little hurt. The mud dries too quickly. Others good.
4,Good,"I think it's good, not use too many times now, hope it works well.It's not painful when I applied mask on my face."
