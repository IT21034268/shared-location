5,My Second Favorite Season of the New Series,I absolutely love Doctor Who. I think the acting is phenomenal and the stories always get more creative every episode. I think Christopher Eccelston was a funny yet passionate Doctor. I love the character of Rose Tyler portrayed by Billie Piper. She is and always will be my favorite character on the show. I love the way Rose and the Doctor's relationship grew throughout the season and how much they grow to love each other. They are probably my favorite couple EVER. I live in Hawaii so I would always watch Doctor Who on the computer. It was so awesome to be able to see it on my TV. I can't wait to get the second season as that is my favorite. But I strongly recommend you get this box set if you live in the States since it doesn't normally air here. Or if you're just an all around die hard Doctor Who fan. I bought it for both reasons :)
5,Can't Go Wrong with the Doctor!,"What's to review? If you are even looking at this then you probably already know what you're getting into. This is the DVD set of the first series.We in the US will be surprised to find many new scenes that were cut from SciFi's & BBCA's broadcasts. Each disc has neat stuff like interviews and behind the scenes stuff. It's the new Doctor, it's on DVD.You know, I do have one thing to complain about. The packaging is not terribly practical! One must remove the plastic sleeve and then unfold the box to remove the DVDs. If you are like me and constantly switching out discs, you'll go mad and wish for a much simpler design. It's really more of a collector's package. But that doesn't diminish the glory that is Doctor Who!"
5,Dr. Who Convert,"I always HATED Dr. Who...then a friend loaned me this. I'm now a convert and can't wait to watch series two. This was well-written, well-performed and engaging.I finally understand how Daleks can be scary."
3,"More cheesy than the later series, but still enjoyable.","Chris Eccleston brings likeable humor to the doctor, but the issue is not with him. The issue is with, #1: The enemies. The walking mannequins are even less convincing than in the classic series (NOT due to the CGI, which always has and always will be bad -- so get used to it -- but simply because of design decisions and the characters' interactions with them), and a certain rubberized trash container gives that episode an unwelcome cartoonish flavor. Later, there are farting aliens. #2: Supporting actors. The doctor and his assistant Rose are more than adequate in their roles, but Rose's family, particularly her boyfriend, are such terrible actors (particularly when interacting with CGI. Once again, I must bring up a certain cartoon trash can) that the overall quality of the entire series is lowered. In summation, the ideas are good, but apparently the staff were on different pages as to what the tone of the series should be."
4,Quite enjoyable!,"I started watching this series because I heard great things about it, but was originally questioning why everyone liked it. The first few episodes were interesting, but only okay. I kept going though, and about halfway through season 1 they got really good. The story only gets more compelling and enjoyable, with fun cameos like Queen Victoria and Charles Dickens. All in all, I am extremely glad I got into this series."
4,Number of discs? Got 5 not 6,"I ordered this version of the set and the description talks about the sixth disc but there are only 5 discs and there is only room for 5 discs in the case. This is very typical of Amazon to have incorrect descriptions. Bummer. As for the show, 5 stars. As for Amazon description 4 stars."
3,"Great Show, But What's with the Price?","I never used to watch Dr. Who before, but this series got me hooked. But... thirteen episodes for $65? Isn't that a tad pricey? Even Star Trek is less expensive than that per episode."
2,Starts slow,"The first about three episodes are absolute arse and should be called the Billi Piper show, but they get better as they go along with some cool story lines and great costumes"
1,Don't understand the hype,"I don't understand why so many people are into this show. It's a typical English, over the top, cheesy, idiotic show. I think it belongs in the kids section."
5,Season 2 starting soon in UK,"Melody X, Im sorry you're wrong. Season 2 starts here this month, the trailers look fantastic. Also, David Tennant & Billie Piper have already signed up for Season 3, so this amazing, gripping program is set to run on and on. Watch this space."
5,The new Doctor Who is Fantastic,Anyone curious for more reviews should check another Amazon listing for this product:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JO9H50 reviews averaging 5 stars at last count. Comments from old and new fans.
2,New packaging stinks!,"I love Doctor Who and I LOVE this first season, so let me be clear about that.It's this new packaging that has me on the ropes right now. I am lucky to have the old one case that stands up like the Tardis on all four sides.This new way is basically your plain DVD box.If you want the old one, you can still pick it up on Amazon.uk, but the region of the disks are PAL and not NTSC (which means they won't work on most DVD/Blu Ray players here in the US), but it only goes for about $20 anyway.Yes, I know I am giving a lower rating because of the packaging, but I think it's worth noting on here.At least Amazon could have written in the description that this is a REVISED version of the series.Still, if you have never seen Doctor Who at all, then you MUST see this and if you don't care about packaging, then pick this up either here or at WBstore.comTake care everyone!"
4,5 Stars for the Show... 3 Stars for the Price,"$65 for 13 episodes of a TV show seems drastically out of line with ""full season"" box sets of other shows, such as Homicide, CSI, or Law & Order.That said, this is a great show and both new and old Dr. Who fans will find it amazingly accessible."
5,Exciting!,"Starting our Who collection, this was a really fantastic lightening deal price! This will be one of those 'gift for us' Christmas presents! :)"
5,"Great ""new"" beginning for a classic show.","I wasn't sure I'd like the new twist on Dr Who, so I went in to the season without high hopes. I was wrong. It caught me from the very first episode. I was immediately invested in the Doctor and Rose."
3,Fun Show,"It is a really cute show. Not the best graphics, but I enjoy watching it. I also realize it's an older show and the story line is a bit out there. Of course, that's what makes it fun."
4,Love the Doctor,"This is the series with which I started my Who-obsession, given I've noticed others having a hard time starting here. Yes, it can be cheesy, but it's a great intro to the reboot and leads well into the Tennant years. Don't skip Eccleston!Note: I had issues with the Marketplace seller I purchased this set from. The first ""new"" set they sent me was falling apart and very fishy. The ""replacement"" set they sent me was missing the outer cover and I'm fairly certain they just ordered a used set from another seller and shipped it to me. In the end I was able to scrounge a complete set and returned the other to the seller, but it was terribly annoying overall. The seller was very friendly and appeared to be trying to work out the issues, but be very careful buying Who DVDs from marketplace sellers (even if they are supposed to be new DVDs). I've read reviews for other seasons by customers suspicious of pirated copies."
4,Just as expected,"I love Doctor Who and love that I now have the first series. There really isn't much to say about it, after all, it's the Doctor and there isn't much better!"
2,Reviewing the DVD set not the show,"The show itself is fantastic ... as the new Doctor would put it. I recommend it with 5 stars no problem. However. $64.00 for a set of 13 episodes on DVD is insanely expensive. I feel like such a set should go no more than $38 at the max. I don't care what the special features the price is way too much. If you have a recorder ... it would be cheaper to just record them from off Sci-Fi network, and live with that. The BBC is obviously selling only to a niche market with a price like this. I love Doctor Who, and I love this new series, but if all I can do is watch it on Sci-Fi and online ... then so be it at this price."
5,Love the New Show!,"Our whole family loved watching 'Doctor Who' and was happy to get these DVDs. We can only hope that the next season makes it over to the U.S. The characters, dialogue, and even bad guys, were interesting and clever. Thanks."
2,No Who,"This show is only Dr. Who by name, I have been a longtime fan of Dr. Who (all of the doctors) I like some more then others, but that is a complete shame. I don't think any real fan would like this."
5,A wonderful Doctor even if Matt Smith is your first,"I became a Who fanatic a couple of seasons ago during the first run of the 11th Doctor's first season. Matt Smith does an amazing job and I thought I could never accept the other Doctors. Those fears though seem to be completely unfounded as Christopher Eccleston is fantastic. If you are already a Whovian, or if you've never before traveled with The Doctor, you will not be disappointed."
5,Excellent Choice,It was the fastest turn around I have had to date. I chose the basic shipping and it was here in 3 days
5,Awesome Special Features,"Got this for Christmas, one of my favorite series and the special features are so awesome! Well worth the wait."
2,Too much money,I love Doctor Who. I loved the first series. But you get only 13 episodes for over $50. That is unacceptable. Do not buy this until they lower the price.
4,Doctor Who the complete first series,I bought this dvd series and return the first order for an replacement got the replacement and there still one episode on the second dvd where it get to the crash landing it blackout will keep it since that the only areas where there a problem but will be hesitant to order the second season because of this problem. otherwise since I am a fan of Doctor Who it was great series
1,Wow - That was Stupid,"I tried. I really tried. I want to be in on the cultural phenomena, but this was mind-bendingly bad. I mean, sure it's old, but the writing, the acting, all of it was just so bad."
3,Not the best of the newer series,I feel that this series is not the strongest of the newer ones. The stories are not as strong nor is the actor that plays the doctor. I can see why he only lasted one season.
3,Struggling to Get It Right: Season 1,"The entire first season feels coarse and jumpy as if cast and writers were both struggling to get the feel of Doctor Who right. They never did. And it is almost painful to watch the male lead. (I know he is a fine actor but it's clear that he could never connect with this character.)I recommend buying this season, however, just to get the characters and back stories straight so you can better understand some of the plot elements in the FABULOUS season 2-5. That really adds (even though it feels more like doing homework than entertainment)."
5,Wonderful interduction of characters,"The interduction to this Doctor Who series as BBC brings back our favorite doctor is awesome. I love how this doctor acts with Rose, and we learn about him. For newer people getting into Doctor Who this will help. No we won't get to know his past adventers that he's had, but it gives you insight to know how this one reacts. Being the 9th Doctor Christopher Eccleston is awesome. I do enjoy the characteristics he brought into being the doctor. It brings his own flare to it and his interaction with Rose is sweet. Jack Harkness is awesome coming in, we see him as a con-man adding a flare to the Doctor and Rose's relationship."
5,Everything you want from a box set,"The first series of the new Doctor Who is presented in fine style in this box set. The stories are good and there is a commentary on every episode! Other special features include behind the scenes views, special effects planning, and the like, but those are mostly space filler: good enough for what they are, but not really a selling point.The reason to buy this is the stories, of course. Christopher Eccleston manages to be both funny and dangerous as the new Who and Billie Piper updates the role of companion for a new era. Not since ""Star Trek"" spawned ""Next Generation"" (and perhaps never) has a cancelled series returned in such fine form.Well worth getting."
4,Dr. Who ?,I remember catching a few episodes Doctor Who when I was younger and loved. But after watching the new incarnation I am now an even bigger fan.
5,Too Good to Be True??,"It came just in time, and with an additional disc( 2 disc 3s). Good series to start off with. Excellent service and product was in excellent shape!!"
4,"Love the series, but why so expensive?","I really love this series. It's a very fun, fast paced, and addicting show. My only complaint is that the DVDs are so expensive. I wish they would lower the cost a bit and then I'd have no problem getting them for my collection. Until then, I just watch 'em on NetFlix :-)"
5,doctor who-- the complete first series,I loved this series...packaging was great...Seemed like background sound over powered the voices...but I don't care because I love these actors..
4,New Doctor Who,"I was never a Doctor Who fan, thinking it was obscure, British, and old. However, I decided to give it a shot and started watching Doctor Who, beginning with this season here. I was hooked! The first episode seems a little silly but after that things pick up quickly. You don't have to know anything about Doctor Who to start watching, since the show was off the air for awhile and it was put back on the air with the idea of catching a whole new audience. However, if you do know about Doctor Who, it's really fun to see old friends and species that reappear. Anyway, as an American girl who had never watched Doctor Who before, I went from watching this one season to watching all of the recent stuff and then going back to watch the old stuff too. I would definitely recommend this show, and this season in particular, to anyone interested in a deep, thought-provoking, adventure-filled ride!"
5,This isn't the old Dr. Who. It's better!,"I love the original Dr. Who and I was skeptical, but the new series is modern, well written, excellently acted and captivating even if you've never seen an episode of the original. Christopher Eccleston is a fanatistic Doctor and very sexy. Billie Piper's acting will surprise you. They're a great team (along with very tight screen writing) making a fabulous action adventure, love story throughout the season. The humour is dry and quick, but unmistakably, ""the doctor""."
1,Zell is a right wing moron,"This book, much like Zell's convention speech, is one long-winded diatribe of hate directed towards people who don't have as much money as him, don't have his skin color and don't share his ""conservative values."" If you loved the convention speech, you'll sure as heck love this, except you miss the sight of the red-faced gent spitting voraciously into the microphone.The biggest laugh to me is when Zell cites his ""marine"" experience and then attacks John Kerry. There's an unspoken bond between brothers in arms, and if this guy ever served, he sure as heck wouldn't be the type of marine you'e ever want to turn your back on. Him a marine? Not in any unit I ever served in.I don't know what type of America you live in, pal, but in my America, there is room for everyone, not just the right wing bigots that might agree with me. That is the kind of America I fought for and the kind of America it looks like we all will have to keep fighting for."
1,Zell On Earth!!!!,"Before you think this guy has any licks of sense in his pen worth your eyes to see, remember, he stood on national TV and challenged Chris Matthews to a friggin' DUEL! This was right after he finished giving a fire and brimstone rant that left the camera lenses too close to run away drenched in spittle.Miller's are the tired ravings of a man too old to recognize that the civil war is over, and so is his worthiness. Pass for someone who's got a still functioning brain. Even the overbaked Sean Hannity is a better read than this."
2,Do we need two Republican Party's Zell?,This guy comes from a long line of political opportunists from the south. I remember him giving rousing speeches on behalf of Bill Clinton back in 1992 and in 96.If Zell had his way we would have a two party system. Two conservative parties! One is enough Zell. So glad you are retiring.
1,crazy dueling banjo freak,"If Zell Miller wants to live in a dictatorship, he's free to want that, but he's crazy with hatred for a party that has no power. What a noble guy! Rage against the oppressed - what a man! This book is insane. I read it at the local library and wondered how he considers himself a conservative democrat when he supports a man who spends like a drunken sailor on shore leave (though the drunken sailor isn't a fighter, but more of a mascott pretending to be a fighter....) and bloats the Federal government beyond and Democrat's wildest dreams....why so many in the GOP have let hatred be the guiding force i'm not sure. I actually believe in God and the God in the Bible isn't the champion of hatred and vitriol."
1,Miller IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH for the Democratic Party!,"Really, this work is a paen to fascism; the Miller elicits a knee-jerk subservience to George W. Bush that leads one to conclude that Miller's ... was as erect as possible just thinking about his ""commander and chief.""Miller's subconcious homoerotica would belong next to Henry Miller's works, save for the fact that Henry was a literary giant, and Zell, well, let's just say that this tome is the ""dark and stormy night"" of fascist-loving devotionals."
1,The Chameleon's True Colors - A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,"What you have is a man who found it politically advantageous to claim he was a Democrat for over 40 years. Now that he is retiring, he longer needs to ""pretend"". He was extremely cowardly to lie about his political beliefs.I have nothing but disgust for this liar (no wonder he can relate to Bush and his Axis of Weasel).This book is a waste of pulp - too bad good trees had to be cut down for this trash top be printed."
2,"Zell is a Southern Right-Winger,not a Conservative Democrat","As an ex-democrat, I was curious about this book. Zell makes several good points, but he cares little about God's Green Earth and is content to stand by while the wealth of this Nation wicks up to the Corporate Class. Wealth does not trickle down! If the taxcuts had gone entirely to families with incomes under $100,000, most of the tax savings would already be in the economy,and workers would be able to find work. Zell supports Bush's re-election. His real constituancy can afford to pay $2000 out of their tax cuts to have lunch with Bush or Cheney, while the average American's tax cut wouldn't buy them a Republican appetizer."
1,Zell Out,"""A National Party No More"" is a collection of the simpering whinings of a career politician who is so wishy-washy that he probably has to change his tie several times a day to make sure he pleases everyone. Lots of insipid anecdotes about pluck triumphing over adversity and the heroic deeds of the Miller clan, including the author's own heroic stint in the peacetime Marine Corps. The book does nothing to dispel the rumor that a prior Miller, Pvt. Zebulon Miller, deserted the Confederate army on the eve of the battle of Gettysburg because he was afraid, switched to the Union side, and later entertained delegates to the 1864 Republican National Convention by wearing a funny hat and banging out ""Dixie"" on a wash tub."
5,"Like it or night, He's right.","This book was written well before the 2004 presidential election, in it a prominent and successful lifetime Democrat tells the world that his party is no longer one that can hold or hope to hold any national majority; in it he warns of the errors in thought and philosophy that his party is making; in it he predicts failure at the national level for his party. All these things are true, and 2004 proved that at the national level, the Democrats are failures. This book helps explain why. For these reasons alone, this book should be read."
1,Zigzag Zell is at it agan,"Zell was a segregationist in 1964 and worked for the racist Lester Maddox from 1966 to 1970. Later he was moderate to liberal denouncing the first Bush for being rich in 1992. Now he is goo goo eyed over the young Bush.Zell says JFK carried Georgia becuase he was for a strong defense and was not a tax hiker. In 1964 LBJ lost Georgia, though he did not raise taxes and certainly was no dove. What happened? The Civil Rights Act!!!!What Zell is afraid to face is the fact that southern whites left the Democrats when Blacks got civil rights. Its called racism and Miller is in denial about this. Cant seem to accept the role of race in changing the South. This blindess weakens his analysis."
2,another southerner,"I admire Zell Miller for calling himslef a Democrat. But it is easy to see how he has sold out to the Bushees. He says he admires John Kerry's service in Vietnam, but questions his ability to run the country. Now he questions everything Kerry has done and stood for, and won't criticize a single thing on the Bush agenda. I am saddened that an American Senator will so willfully sell out and criticize many issues he once stood for such as health care, and higher education, in order to discredit one of his own colleagues who believes in the things Mr. Miller once supported."
1,Then what's the point of staying a Democrat if you're pretty much Republican,"Look, if you don't like the party you thought you were going to be a part of, then you shoulda just switched for crying out loud. Your Republican buddies already asked you to switch and even my dumb gluck Senator Trenty Lotty boy who defines bipartisanship as Zell Miller and (any neocon repug) badly wanted you to switch. Oh, wait a minute, you relied on former Senator Tom Daschle, really nice and weak, to give you life support all the while you went on TV and bashed him. I read this stupid book at Walmart and put it back upside down with people cheering. Even Archie Bunker was not this stubborn. I'm conservative, not the neocon style like today's cons, and I DISapprove of this book."
1,"Where's your ""conscience"" on segregration, Zell?","Zell Miller is not a Democrat, he's a Dixiecrat. He's one of these creaking segregationist, Southern-strategy holdovers, the last of the Confederates who didn't cross over to the Republican Party.He doesn't have any of the values of the Democratic Party, and is a ""Democrat"" in name only. Hey Zell, isn't it time you joined your segregrationist, deceased friend Strom Thurmond, and headed over to the Republican side? They welcome old racist Southerners like you."
1,let the PURGE begin!,"Now if we can get this type of ""Democrat"" off the KERRY team, he might actually win."
2,Don't be bushwacked by Miller,"This book is just a conclusion to a politcal career of a politician who never agreed with his party, nor the values that they stood for. Miller is just another example of the South and its transition to the Republican Party since the Nixon push. While, Miller identifies himself as a ""conservative Democrat."" He never believed in the platform setforth by the Democrats, hence, he was truly never a true ""Democrat."" This book reveals this, as a Democrat, this is why this book is interesting. It shows and attempts to enter the mind of an individual that should of left the party years ago and engage the reader as to why he was a Democrat for so long. While his appearance at the RNC was a hate filled message filled with lies and nonsense, he had to do it to save face and have one last hurrah. This book was the presequel to the hurrah."
1,Rights of the Individual,"In his book Mr. Miller states he believes a person should be allowed to use another person's body without that persons consent. What next Mr. Miller? Mandatory kidney donations? Repeal of rape laws? Do the Democrats a favor Mr. Miller and join the GOP, or, better yet, retire."
1,"Zell ""Dennis"" Miller","What a piece of work this creep is. Zell's book is all about his pathetic sycophancy towards our MisLeader Bush. Zell just cares about zelling a few books. More conservative than Hannity. Coming to the dollar bins at used book stores everywhere in November, 2004."
1,What ZELL didn't tell you: Lester Maddox's Key Man,"For those of us who have known Zell and watched his career, this book in which he abandons those who have supported him over the years is not surprising. So, he makes his case on the shortcomings of the Democratic Party but then jumps ship on the party and friends that elected him to every public office he held. WHAT HE DOES NOT BRAG ABOUT OR TELL HIS READERS IS THAT HE WAS LESTER MADDOX'S EXECUTIVE SECRETARY - CHIEF OF STAFF - WHEN THIS RACIST IDIOT WAS ELECTED GOVERNOR OF GEORIGA. ZELL WORKED FOR HIM FOR FOUR YEARS. It is not surprising to those of us who know him that he - at the end of his political career - returns to the comfort of the right wingers that he started off with!"
1,The Conscience of a Segregationist,"This book makes it painfully clear that flag-waving robots like Zell Miller will stop at nothing to promote mindless patriotism. In the mind of this pathetic old segregationist, patriotism requires silent submission to whoever happens to be president. Defending America can only be proven by unwavering support for every Pentagon budget. Acknowledging American mistakes offers aid and comfort to the enemy, and anyone who speaks out against the right wing in this country is a traitor. This man made a frightening spectacle of himself on Hardball, and belongs in an institution."
4,A Conservatives Journey in his Party,"This is an interesting book and would appeal mostly to Democrats who consider themselves Reagan Democrats or the like. As some have said, it may have been better if Zell became a Republican, however, Miller mentions that he was raised a Democrat and will die one.Interestingly, earlier in our history the only difference, for the most part, our parties were very similarly conservative with the exception of financial issues. Times have changed, yet Zell Miller reflects on his life as a life long Democrat decrying the lack of direction of that party and what he sees as it's demise.Democrats can use this book to envigorate them to have or develop a specific vision. Republicans though, should not allow a book like this to put them to sleep thinking the Democrats are through. An election is coming, be aware, the Democrats will fight to win this one at all cost."
5,Great Historical View of Dems,"Zell Miller brings 50 years of democratic politics to this excellent analysis of where the party is today. His personal history, well told, helps us understanding why, today, he is fed up with the special-interests' control of his party. The book is full of down-home anecdotes, great inisights into previous presidential campaigns and first-hand knowledge of how the system can destroy a candidate and a party. I highly recommend this book - it is lively and entertaining as well as educational!"
1,This is still in print????,"The whole book was discredited in 2006; November 4, 2008 was the final nail in its coffin. It should be sold only for purposes of ridicule, in a 4-pack with ""Dow 36,000,"" ""Hilary vs. Condi: The Next Great Presidential Race,"" and ""88 Reasons the Rapture Will Be in 1988."""
5,Breath of Fresh Air!,"Senator Miller's book is a breath of fresh air amidst the smog of the Democrat Party. He's right, Democrats have no solutions, only bitter, hateful rhetoric for our President the Republican Party and half of America. They are so out of touch with main stream America and don't have a clue they are.This man has more integrity in his little finger than all nine Democrats could muster up. This is a must read book for anyone who has gotten cynical on politics. There are a few great public servants left and Zell Miller is one of them. The Dems would do well to read this book."
4,A National Party No More,"I found this book very insightful. He brings up good points about how democracy is hindered by the use of filibusters and the embracing of special interest groups. He points out that this has been done by both Republicans and Democrats. He shows what he believes is wrong with the current Democratic Party and what should be done to make it a winning Party once again. I enjoyed his stories of his Southern youth, too."
3,Miller expressions convictions and exposes grudges.,"I really enjoyed learning more about Sen. Miller's career both in and outside of politics and was enlightened by his colorful words of wisdom. However, most of his disagreements with the Party stem from their lack of Southern leadership. Miller's quarrels have validity to them and he addresses the problems our nation faces, but doesn't provide realistic ways to solve them. As a fellow southerner, I agree that the Democratic Party doesn't concern itself with their fellow brethren in the South, but his main view that the party has been corrupted by special interests can just as easily be said about the Republican Party He himself admits to being in bed with special interests throughout his career and it's manipulation of the American Political process, but I just wish he could help answer the question of how to get rid of it. My question for him would be, if he were the Minority Leader, would he have run for re-election?"
1,We don't need two Republican parties,"Zell:One Republican party is enough, we don't need two of them.The Democratic party needs to stand for social justice and equality of opportunity, not for giving huge tax breaks to the very rich, like you voted to do."
1,Retire already,"Once a respectable moderate, he has now turned into the lap dog of the right wing. I wonder how much money he is getting under the table for two timing his politcal party"
4,Read this Book !!,Zell Miller has written a great book. I really enjoyed the book. There were chapters that I agreed with and those that I disagreed with. I am much more impressed with Sen. Miller now than I ever was in the past.For the fan of politics this is an influential book. Regardless of your political affiliation if you follow politics this is a must read. Sen Miller is describing a very interesting segment of the political spectrum. His book is so talked about because it is important. I highly recommend it.
5,Washington Whistle Blower,"Zell talks about a political party moving away from main stream America. He talks about the things wrong in Washington, not only with the Democrats, but the Republicans as well. His book will open some eyes as to how our elected officials do business. Unfortunately, it is not a pretty picture."
2,ha,"""Miller's candid analysis of the campaigns of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton further underscores his conclusion that the Democratic Party can no longer field a serious presidential challenge.""Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. *wipes eyes* Ha..."
5,clear-eyed guy,Written in a plain style but moves like a conversation withthe truth. Revealing. Not hip. Just real.
4,Zell Knows Politics and Zell Knows Democrats,"As a successful Georgia politician, Zell knows why the Democrats have lost their way south of the Mason-Dixon line. As a writer, Zell tells his story in a direct, plain-spoken, and engaging way.The early chapters are chronological and biographical, and the later chapters spotlight issues where Zell thinks the national Democratic party and their Southern constituents part company. Finally, Zell closes with some analysis of the successful and unsuccessful presidential candidates.The chapter breaks are logical and the material is well organized but some details are needlessly repeated. A good editor could have improved this work with just one more draft. Despite this flaw, the book will still help you know Zell, and help you know why the Democrats have lost their way south of the Mason-Dixon line."
2,Let the book stay in print -- it shows what many didn't see exactly the opposite coming...,"In the 2008 election, the Republican performance increased (in a statistically significant way) only in the Appalachian region. Perhaps the author, who is pleased to call himself a hillbilly, should write another book, explaining why his region seems to be increasingly out of step with the rest of the country."
5,Draft Zell for President!,I am a faithful centrist Democrat and after reading this book I want to suggest that everyone write to both Senator Miller and to the DNC requesting that Sen. Miller enter his hat in the ring for president in 2004. What a guy! He could crush all of these naive nine currently running.
4,Get a clue already liberals!!!,The liberals don't have a clue and it shows. They wouldn't know a national party if it hit them in the face. Their extreme liberal agendas simply do not resonate in the South. Here in Crimson Tide country we'd rather see Tommy Tuberville elected President before Howard Dean. Period.
2,Miller is insistent but unconvincing,"Zell Miller fails to make the case that George W. Bush deserves re-election. The senator, regarded as a turncoat by many in his own party, seems to give no better reason for not having switched parties than the fact that he was ""born a Democrat."" Miller repeatedly refers to the objection of Democrats to the GOP version of the Homeland Defense Department, but fails to site many other specific examples of how Democrats have failed to reach the majority of the American people. Even though he praises Bill Clinton for being a brilliant campaigner, he pounces on the former president's personal moral failures, giving him no credit whatsoever for the strong economy and foreign policy successes of the 1990s. To his credit, Miller is concerned with how the Democratic party can reach ordinary Americans. Still, he fails to provide clues as to how his party could do better."
1,The book is nothing more than mindless ranting.,"I was hoping for an indictment of the misdirection of the latter day Democratic Party and a new vision for where to take the Party, but this book was neither. Instead, it is nothing more than 250 pages of a grumpy old man's ranting in the abstract and offering nothing to the reader but mindless polemic and infrequent anecdotes about how he used to walk to school in the snow uphill both ways, etc. This Texan was not impressed by Miller's supposed critique. Don't waste your money on this garbage rag of a book."
1,"Just the book, please!","Would somebody please review THIS BOOK and not Zell Miller, and not the Democratic Party or American politics today?? After reading 20 reviews I still don't know what he has to say!"
1,Miller the Republican,"Zell Miller labels himself a conservative Democrat. Note to Zell: There's a difference between being a conservative Dem and a Republican, which is what he has become. The guy votes with Bush 100% of the time. How can he even label himself a Dem? This is not the story of a Democrat voting for Bush in 2004. It's the story of a Republican voting for Bush in 2004."
1,A democrat no more.,"In this book, Mr. Miller purports to critique the Democratic Party, but what he does is give reasons why he should not be a democrat. Seeing that he is for inequality, allegiance to George Bush, and the foolish war on Iraq, it best behooves him to just join the George Bush party and leave the democrats. Although the democrats under Clinton abandoned its working class roots, at least they give the average American a bone or two, while the party of George Bush have only one thing on their mind, to make sure the wealthy get more money. By this book only if you live in a world of fantasy."
1,This man is pathetic,"If he votes with the Republicans 90% of the time and if he is filled with such vehement hatred for the Democratic Party (which funded this hypocrite's re-election campaign), the logical step would be to switch parties, as the Tennessee representative Lamar Alexander recently did.But oh no. Being a so-called Democrat bashing the Democratic Party works much better; it sells more books and gets more gigs booked on Fox News.Zell Miller is an embarrassment. It's funny how all these Bushbots laud Miller for his 'courage and conviction', yet were the first ones to lambast Jim Jeffords when he left the Republican Party to be an Independent.I hope this devious, money-grubbing, sad man makes a lot of money off this book. Money can't buy him his integrity back though. Good riddance."
1,seeking power,"The man sees his power waning. and is now seeking to kiss the feet of the right wing hate mongers. It is pure trash and should be ridiculed in that manner. The man is an ugly little toad who has no sense of what a joke he is. He is being used by the right wing for their own purposes. But soon he will be like that other example of virtue, Paula Jones, be thrown out with the republican trash!"
1,Birds of a Feather,"All you need to know about this book is that Amazon.com is pairing it for marketing purposes with Ann Coulter's fictional offering ""Treason."""
5,Zell Miller tells it as it is,"Whether your Democrat or Republican, after reading a National Party No More you'll probably agree with most of Zell Miller's points. He clearly identifies how leaders of the Democrats are not in touch with the overwhelming majority of Democrats. In addition to Miller's excellent analysis of the state of the Democrat party, we receive an overview of Senators Miller's positions on numerous key political issues over the years."
5,Right on Target!!!,"Finally a ""Real"" Democrat who has the track record to hold the feet of the far left faction controlling the Democrats to the fire. It's hard for his critics to launch ad hominem attacks as he was ""and is"" a staunch Democrat."
4,Zell will be missed!,"Zell's book gives you a look at his beliefs, values and ideals for our country. Being a politician all of his life, when he was elected Senator and got into the Washington crowd, it changed many of his opinions about his party and our government."
3,Correction,"I have not read the book; and, thanks to the reviewers' descriptions, I'll most likely not purchase nor read it.Hence, the neutral, 3-star rating.A correction, though, to the first Spotlight Reviewer's comment on Senator Jeffords' switch: Jeffords is from Vermont, NOT New Hampshire. Please...give us SOME credit up here in NH."
1,Zell Miller is a disgrace to himself and his party.,Zell Miller has given up the Democratic Party he once belonged to. I am not surprised he doesn't feel at home with today's Democrats. He should have left it when others such as he did after the Republicans established their Southern strategy.
5,A National Party No More,"What I gleaned from this book is a fantastic description of a real patriot. It is not often these days, a person explains and stands for his/her patriotism......In fact, there seems to be very little partiotism in this country any more.I would like for my kids,grandkids and friends to read and consider the conscience of Zel Miller, and what he has to relate in this book. It would be nice if more of our leaders would walk the talk rather than bow to the deep pockets.Was it ole Abe who said, ""don't complain unless you have a solution"". Lots of intelligent solutions in this book."
2,Grossly Overrated,This is supposedly a condemnation of the Democratic Party and a prescription for how they can heal themselves. Instead it is more of a treatise of Zell Miller's life and philosophy. The reviewers say the Democratic Party would do well to heed his warnings but his warnings are buried somewhere in over 230 pages of remembrances. I doubt the Democratic Party would listen to his prescription but he could have done a better job articulating that prescription.Overall a very weak and disappointing book.
1,OPINIONS ARE NOT FACTS,"On page 103 Miller refers to the income tax on social security benefits and states: ""starting in 1993 these benefits were taxed"". We know who was in office in 1993 however Miller is wrong. The tax was imposed in 1983 and went into effect in 1984 as part of the Reagan Revolution. Millers conservatives have had several years to repeal this onerous tax on the retirees of America and chose not to. They cut the tax for the wealthy but left it in place for those on pensions. Senator Moynihan said it best: ""Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts"". It seems to me he should have known this. Those of us who have to pay it and are hurt by it know it all too well, I guess those who are real wealthy don't notice it at all. I don't think Bob Dole misses the extra tax on his ss income as much as the widow with retirement income of 25k. I have to wonder if anyone even proof reads these political books that are churned out en masse."
2,Didn't do it for me,"I purchased this as a gift for my Superman-crazed younger brother, but I couldn't get past about 45 minutes into it. I found it slow, unexciting, and didn't feel the acting was very strong. Definitely nowhere near the level Christpher Reeve played Superman/Clark Kent, though I'm not sure anyone could top him."
5,Super Movie!!!,"Need I say anything more? I mean, first of all, I'm a Super-Fan, I liked the movie, and I love it when DVD's come out choc-ful-o-extra features like Behind-the-Scenes and stuff. I'm very pleased with this DVD. As most of you may already know, there are two versions of the DVD that are out. There's this one and then the other one that has only the movie. If you like special features, you need to get this one. Besides, for some odd reason, this one is kind of hard to find in the stores these days."
1,Stinks,"Had this been the first, there would have been no second.The Superman I read as a boy stood for ""Truth, Justice and the American Way."" He wore a red, white and blue costume. And he would not leave Lois Lane with an illegitimate child.I really liked the actors; too bad they didn't have more to work with. In fact, too bad they did work together. At times I got the impressionthat they were less then comfortable in their roles."
4,The Man Of Steel Is Back...With A Vengeance.,"After 20 years, The Man Of Steel is back...with a new face. From the director & writer of ""The Usual Suspects"" (an engrossing suspense thriller with a wicked twist of an ending) comes the ""Sequel"" to""Superman II."" Disregarding the abysmal ""Superman III"" & ""Superman IV"" (despite a terrific performance from Christopher Reeve; stupid script & horrible direction), this film is a sequel & homage to the films made in 1978 & 1980. Brandon Routh makes an interesting Clark Kent/Superman, but he fell flat when he said the lines spoken by Christopher Reeve in the original. I enjoyed the subplot with Lois Lane and her son. Really good. I'm looking forward to the sequel. Rated PG for action violence."
1,Dreadful,"Borying. That resumes the whole movie. Not even the special effects are good, Superman's image is so artificial that in some parts of the film you wonder whether there is a Mattel tag on the suit behind the cape."
2,DVD lacks content - Rent rather than buy.,"I think superhero fans will enjoy watching the movie, but I do not recommend buying it for your collection. The basic DVD you buy in the store offers just the movie and no additional content. Warner Brothers packed the fun extras in its more expensive two disc special edition packages. Part of the reason for buying a movie, rather than rent it, is the appeal of the extras. Good try Warner Brothers and Bryan Singer, but it is not worth my hard earned money."
3,Too Much Focus on the Effects... No real story,"I went to see Superman Returns with high hopes, especially with the much improved special effects from the previous movies. Unfortunately, that is what this movie centered around - the special effects. I lost all connection with the characters... Lois and Clark - unrequited love - what? They have basically one scene in the entire movie where you start to connect with the characters and their dilemmas, but it is shortly followed by an intense action scene, leading up to the ultimate finale.The special effects carried this movie, stunning my eyes with their realism. I loved the movie while I was watching it, but afterwards it only left a bitter taste in my mouth - a tasteless blend of storyless droll with an overly pronounced dash of special effects. I am sure my opinion will be a less than popular one, but, I guess, it is just because my hopes for this movie were unexpectedly trampled upon."
1,"Good movie, but awful DVD","The movie was OK, but it seemed better than OK because of it's stunning visuals. Unfortunately, this is one of the worst jobs at mastering a DVD I have seen in ages. Compression artifacts abound, colors are blah and banded, and every dark scene (which is about a third of the movie) is plagued with botchiness and muddling compression problems.What a disgrace to the Superman legacy. I've seen home movies with fewer compression problems than this thing."
2,A Super Dissapointment,"The acting in this film is actually pretty good. I mean, it's not oscar worthy or anything, but it's based on a comic book and the actors give noteworthy performances. That said, the script is pretty bad - not going to lie. The beginning of the film is poorly edited and choppy, and the plot line throughout the entire film is weak. Tristan Lebeau is ardorable as Lois Lane's 5 year-old son, and provides some comic relief to an otherwise drab film. Kevin Spacey's malicious Lex Luther also provides for a few laughs. In all honesty I could go on and on to credit the rest of the cast as well - they were well chosen and did the best they could with a weak and flawed script. Ah well, let's just hope Superman Returns again in an entertaining film..."
1,Christopher Reeves turns in his grave on this one,"This movie was a sad endeavor. I saw it with a few friends of mine and we all fell asleep about 20 minutes in. It was as dull as dull can be with the only saving grace being the special affects. The bullet in the eye - very cool and the plane landing. Other than that - pathetic. And yes, you would think that someone like Bryan Singer whose X-MEN 1 and 2 were excellent could have done something great with this, however it was a train wreck. Weak story + great special affects = bad movie."
1,I wish I had never watched it,"This movie is a $ rip-off on the original Superman films. From the opening scene, the movie is unrealistic, the acting terrible and the characters are lifeless. Gene Hackman was a MUCH better Lex than this guy. Reeves was also a much better Superman than this forgettable acter (whom I don't know the name of and really don't care). The soundtrack is EXACTLY the same as the original film...I guess whomever produced the film either has no creativity at all to make a new sound track or was just trying to save $. If you saw and loved the 1978 film you will hate this movie. To be honest, I turned it off about 1/2 way though (after that ridiculous scene where the airplane almost crashes into the stadium and everyone starts clapping) and tried to forget I ever saw it. This movie proves ALL THAT IS WRONG WITH TODAYS MOVIES. All fluff and no substance, realism or creativity. Don't waste your time with this."
1,What a SAPPY MOVIE - waste of time !!!!!!!!,"WASTE OF TIME ........................Movie is to long, boring, lacks action, focuses on the past love life.....VERY VERY disapointing.They turned the name 'superman' into a no-action-boring, try-to-tug-our-heart-strings-and-fail-movie.Would never watch it again.Felt it was bad enough to write something."
2,Spend you money on something else.,This movie was a huge let down. It goes from good picture quality to bad back and forth the entire movie. Its hard to believe that a new movie would be released with such bad quality. This should be a $16 movie not a $22+.
1,1 Star is far too generous for this piece of tripe,"Judging by the trailers I saw, I thought this was going to be a great blockbuster flick with Superman returning to the big screen in glorious fashion. Not so. This movie is lifeless, unoriginal, banal and dull. Nothing is exciting, nothing is done exceptionally well or well at all for that matter. Miscasting of actors, atrocious dialogue, boring action sequences, tired pacing, awful script, bad looking Superman costume, you name it, this movie failed in virtually every respect. I took my fiancee with me to see it. She hated it, too. Who can blame her? I want my damn money back. Bryan Singer, what the hell were you thinking? Going from the excellent X-Men movies to this B.S.?"
1,"Truth, Justice = deadbeat dad & peeping tom?","There are two main reasons why this Superman film fails to fly inspite of the special effects.What Singer and company have missed is the heart of Superman - virtues. The ideal of the American way (noticably absent) is supposed to go hand in hand with truth and justice. Donner made the mistake in the 70's of having Superman sleep with Lois, and now Singer adds insult to injury by having Superman discover he has an illegitmate child that he doesn't take responsibility for (deadbeat dad). Using his super powers to invade the privacy of Lois in her home, drags Superman down to the level of creepy (peeping tom).The second issue concerns personality. Routh and Bosworth look nice but have no charm and no chemistry. These are the two ingredients that made Reeves and Kidder so endearing.A new director, writers, and cast is needed. Until then, at least there's Superman 1."
3,What has bryan done?,"I'll make this short and sweet. Brandon sucked y? he can't play clark. kate was okay. kevin spacey was the s***. The overall movie as a whole was boring it seemed like bryan was trying to hard to copy the first films instead of just doin it he's way. And so focused on finding a christopher reeve look alike he missed the acting ability. Not enough action. And somebody please tell me y did he leave when at the end of 2 ""I will never leave again"" to the president and then bam he's gone. it's was completely retarded. So in conclusion gj WB you really f'd this up should have keep nichoals cage and tim burton."
3,Five years and a sucker punch by Lex,"Kind of long, and the special effects are sometimes strange, but for a superman fan, it is good stuff. Just it has been done before,without the twist of super-son.Kevin Spacey is quite the villain you might want and Kate Bosworthis maybe not as sexy as other Lois actresses?But the plot with the crystal growing island is pretty good.I like it."
2,I could have seen this in the Reeve films.,"I mean, where's the super villians from the comics? It's Superman vs Luthor & kryptonite again..this isn't new stuff..its old! If Luthor's the villian again, why couldn't we get him in that armor or him & some super villians vs Superman? Geez.."
2,"More like ""Stupidman""","Not very good. Slow and plodding, with huge plot holes. Decent special fx, nothing special. The whole Superman-in-the-hospital thing was ridiculous. Acting OK, not great. Lex Luthor stuck on an island at the end was dumb. A disappointment."
3,Superman needs a new story!,The scenes are often too long.... Very few humorous lines. No development to Lex Luther story. Scenes of crystals growing and superman flying and enjoying the sun went on way too long and so did this movie.A couple of very good special effects - saving the plane etc. Its' amazing that after crashing around a plane for 10 minutes...Lois Lane .... doesn't have a bruise or a mark on her! After being kicked and beat up by a thug not a mark or any blood. Maybe she should be superman.:).The original Superman theme by John Williams was used but the rest of the music was very sorely lacking.I don't recommend spending money to see this in the movie theatre wait for the DVD.
1,Dreadful,Shockingly bad. Too much emotion and drama. Wanted to see a super hero movie not a soap opera. Wow! That was disappointing.
2,Super Lois...,"Lois to the rescue! *MILD SPOILER ALERT* So Lois jumps into the water to rescue Superman as her boyfriend sits in the helicopter with her kid... what's wrong with this picture? Very dumb, cardboard-y superman movie. Too much violence and no humor worth mentioning."
3,Ehh,"This movie was fair, Kevin Spacey plays an interested Lex that always has some kind of saying to justify his action. Overall its ok. I'd recommend you rent it instead."
3,Super hero collector,This was a fair version of the Super Hero not my favorite but the kids enjoyed it so it was worth the purchase
3,Was Superman in this movie?????,"I was really dissapointed they showed Kate Bosworth (who was horrible compared to the orignal Ms. Lane) more than Superman himself. Was he even in this movie? I wanted to see Brandon Routh! I mean, after all, he IS superman! He was even cuter than the original Superman girls *yum*Sadly we didn't get to see him enough :("
3,SUPERMAN - DULL CAST,"I wanted to like this movie. I enjoyed the previous Superman Films.I felt that the cast was dull. Perry White, Lex Luther, Jimmy Olsen were supposed to be fun and interesting.I didn't get that from this movie."
2,Metrosexual version of Superman..,"This has got to be the most Metrosexual of all comic book adaption of Superhero. So Superman is in rehab for 5 years, finally he comes back, girlfriend Lois, left him, is now a single mother with a live in boyfriend. Yes bring a kid to see this movie. Turns out while he's gone, Lex breaks into his crib and steals his Prized CD collections, puts one on ebay for alot of money. Anyway, we don't need to see too much of the softer side of this Superman. This action movie borderlines cheesy. Costume is the same as in the 80's version. At least put a Carbon fiber 'S' on his chest. Instead of brite red. How about a dark burgandy, dark blue suite that looks like the current version of Batman. The people who made Casino Royale should have come in to write and direct this movie and make Superman much tougher and meaner. Without his power, he couldn't even fight half of Lex Luther. Lex is twice his age. perhaps they should cast Daniel Craig as Superman.Lame movie. Two Stars...."
2,Fast As A Bowel Movement,"I sit here trying to think of something to say but the title sums it up so well.I was really excited to see this movie. I got it for a free rental at Blockbuster or ""score"" right?...Oh, no my friend! The beginnning is just awesome so once again, ""score"" right?...no no no thats where it all goes down hill there are literaly three action scenes in this movie, yes three, all of which have been sadly used time and time again.I've never actually been this bored sitting through a movie. The movies isn't even about Superman it's much more about Lois and goofy looking child. Just when you think is movie is really going to take off they cut scene to the goofy kid and his dumb mother doing one more thing to get into trouble.Never have I felt ripped off from a free movie coupon.Just straight weak."
2,I LIKE SUPERMAN BUT NOT LIKE THIS,"Frist thing is first Lex Luthor is back yet again after I don't know how many defaets by Superman. Will Lex ever give up. I don't understand why Superman doesn't jut break Lex's back so he can never walk again or put him into a coma so he can't come up with another evil plan. Also there is a catch there is a superboy in this one who kills a henchman with a piano but can't break out of a pantry. Did i mention the boy threw the piano at the henchman. Anyway Kevin Spacey does a good job as Lex. Lois Lane is her same old self like in all the rest of the movies. Why can't Superman get a villain who he can actually fight. Kitty Lex's clueless henchgirl pulls off her role. Brandon Routh as Superman I like. The movie is to dramatic though. Barely any action but good effects. So it was a movie I can watch when there are no other choices. Yeah, it is that bad."
2,A Super Blunder,"Superman leaves Earth for 5 years? Lois Lane hooks up with another guy? Superman fathers a child? Three absurdities that would never happen in the Superman universe, yet Bryan Singer gave us all of them in the dark, depressing and ridiculous Superman Returns. Brandon Routh is adequate as the Man of Steel and the special effects are top-notch, but neither is enough to save this sagging and sorry addition to the Superman film legacy. Morose and miscast, a film to avoid."
4,Roundtrip to Krypton in 5 Years???,"The only problem I have with the plot is Superman's roundtrip flight to Krypton in 5 years. Jorel states that he's ""been dead for many thousands of your years"" and it doesn't make much sense that it only take 2.5 years to reach Earth. I always thought the spaceship had some sort of age suppression technology and it took the infant Kalel a long time to reach Earth.It would have been much better if the movie started off with a spectacular action sequence in which Superman does something that causes the death of someone while trying to protect them. Then he decides to go into exile and returns 5 years later. Other than that, I thought the movie was great with outstanding visual effects and a stellar cast."
5,REVIEW FOR MOVIE,THIS IS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE AND MY GRANDKIDS LOVE WATCHING IT.IT WAS A GOOD PURCHASE.NANCY
2,I wish he didn't,"I only watched half of the movie and overall I was not happy.The versions starring the late Christopher Reeve were even better.I'm not taking anything away from Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor,he is a good actor,but I like Gene Hackman better.Also,this movie I hear didn't do well like the previous ones.Why?I think the studio rushed this movie out to the public who are still mourning the death of Christopher Reeve.Kate Bosworth and Brandon Routh are in fact too young to play their roles,they should had casted even more older stars.The good thing I like about the movie was the openning credits using John Williams version of the first movie.Attention Bryan Singer,next time make sure you make more movies that are good."
4,Why we ALL need Superman,"Superman is by far my favorite superhero and best onscreen adaptation of all the comic book characters. I have been a fan of the original Superman and was quite skeptic of this movie knowing that the great Christopher Reeve will not be Superman, but the movie did justice to the originals. It is visually stunning and has everything a Superman movie should have. Brandon Routh had an eerie resemblance to Reeve which mad him totally convincing as Superman almost immediately for me. Also Lex Luthor played by Kevin Spacey was genius! This movie is definitely a great addition to the Superman legacy."
3,Superbland,"This only just merits 3 stars. It really is far too long, and loses a star for that. It loses another star for the frequent and painfully obvious use of CGI and if I was being unkind it would lose more for its over sentimental and sugary styling. How much music with heavenily choirs and strings are we expected to take?I wasn't especially impressed by Brandon Routh, who was clearly copying the Christopher Reeve formula but he was wooden by comparison. The best by far was Kevin Spacey, but he wasn't given a lot to do. The films I've seen that have been directed by Bryan Singer have in general been very good, for me this is his first failure.By all means buy it, if you can get it very cheap, but its not worth spending much on!"
1,awful awful movie,"Lousy dialogue, lousy chemistry, no humour, ridiculous situations. Nice special effects, and Brandon's performance is actually good. But it seems like the screenwriters had no feel for any of the characters, there is very little mystery, and no real surprises. You feel like they just wanted to walk some cardboard cutouts of Superman, Lois Lane and Lex Luthor through dangerous situations without worrying about how they would really feel and react."
4,A Superman For Our Times,"The makers of Superman Returns took this challenge seriously for it's an homage to the Christopher Reeves Superman and, in fact, is dedicated to the Reeves. Shorn of its outdated effects, the CR Superman franchise remains enjoyable because of its characters. Bryan Singer's version with Brandon Routh is darker and deeper than before, but the Superman characterization remains. I never cared for the ditzy Lois Lane of Margot Kidder, so Kate Bosworth's moody one is more effective and sexier (at least for me). Kevin Spacey does his best (and effective) impersonation of Gene Hackman. I particularly enjoyed John Ottman's reworking of John Williams' original themes. Only seeing Kumar do the bully role was a bit disconcerting. Loads of tonge-in-cheek references to previous movies -- Superman and others!"
2,A Waste of my Time: The World is in Fire - Superman (Bryan Singer),"***SPOILER WARNING***So unnecessary. Superman lifts a plane, superman lifts an island, and superman lifts a building's decorative garments. Superman feels bad because Louis Lane is now married and with a child, which is Superman's son (they're trying to build a series). There is no growth, no discussion of the problems of the world, no real heroes here. The devil plan of Lex Luthor is worst than something concocted by ""Austin Powers"" Doctor Evil. Effects are ok, thought, but since good CGI became cheap, that is not enough."
2,Return of What??,"The special effects were awesome but the story was weak. Let me get this straight, Lex Luthor - the evil genius who is the world's smartest villain - has a plan to create uninhabitable real estate?? First off Superman 1 was based on a Real Estate plot. Secondly, who would buy land made of useless crystals??!!!! Then the secondary storyline with Lois and the boy was boring. How could this kid be so lame and nerdy? This is SUPERMAN - they could have written a unique story and made a fantastic movie. Instead this story was lacking in all aspects. Cool special effects and ""epic"" cinematography in some scenes, but overall it was disappointing"
2,HORRIBLE job casting Superman/Clark Kent,"For me, I couldn't get past the fact that the people who put this film together did a HORRIBLE job in casting Clark Kent/Superman. It tarnished the entire movie for me. Not for one SECOND did I believe that Brandon Routh could even come close to pulling off the character. His look was all wrong, and his acting ability is pathetic. While we're on poor casting, Lois Lane looked like she was 19 years old, yet Clark looked 30. Looked like Clark was robbing the cradle!Special effects of the movie were great. The storyline was boring and choppy at times, but overall, it wasn't TOO bad.I simply couldn't get past the fact that this cast was so poorly put together."
3,Disappointing,I was not all that excited about this movie after I watched it. It seemed long and predicatable. I had been excited about the new actors and remaking the Superman series but was not that excited after seeing the movie. They would have done better to bring Smallville to the big screen.
2,"Good Movie, Bad DVD",Do not get this DVD if you are looking for special features. This DVD only contains the movie. No behind the scenes. No commentaries. No interviews. Nothing. You'd be better getting the two disc set.
2,A rehash of the original,"I am not sure how they thought they could get away with this.It is a virtually identical story to the first Chris Reeves Superman.Spoilers next:Lex has a girlfriend who winds betraying him.Lex uses a missile to run up real estate pricesSuperman shows up and catches Lois falling related to an aircraft.Lex uses Kryptonite to almost defeat SupermanThe only ""love scene"" is Superman flying Lois around MetropolisCome on people. You could be a LITTLE original!"
2,"Yeah, Not Likin It","After a horrid third film and a suprising fourth, superman returns for a fifth film. Dont get me wrong i am a superman fan. but i read the comics and was very disappointed with the suprising release of Superman Returns in 2006. I was one of the first into the theater and one of the first out. The Film focuses on special effects and not story OR superman. The story is short but they maneged to twist it to last two hours. Brandon Rauth does an OK job but is not believable as The Man of Steel. I was very disappointed with its release after waiting such a long time for a new age film. this time they did it to new age and took away story for Effects."
4,Fantastic movie! Highly recommended!,"I really enjoyed this movie, though I went into it with some reservations. I am a big fan of the first two Christopher Reeve movies, and knew that this one had a lot to live up to. Well, I was thoroughly satisfied. The perfect mix of action and acting. I was pleasantly surprised by Routh. I thought he did a great job, and that the movie was a great set-up for future sequels. The airplane rescue scene was phenomenal!"
3,Good,Great movie and too bad it is underrated as a good movie great story on the return of a legend. Routh did a great job as superman
1,Special Effects were all that held this movie together.,"This movie was ridiculous, ridiculously terrible that is. It was much in the vain of the old superman movies, which were alright in their day, but quite out of date today. There is never a real sense of threat, due to the way Bryan Singer and Kevin Spacey portray Lex Luthor. Aside from one little plot twist, and some decent special effects this movie is downright terrible. This movie will make true fans of the series vomit. There is almost no resemblance to the complexity of the mythos. This movie was such a great opportunity to bring back the legacy of superman. It looks like were going to have to wait another twenty years for someone to come along and do it right. Do not see this movie, instead I suggest dusting off some old comics or checking out the television show Smallville."
1,Super? Try Dullman,"I think this is the most boring movie that I saw this year! And then again, maybe it suffered because I saw ""Casino Royale"" in the same day. Bond = Action! Superman Returns <> Action! Maybe I've become jaded, but I expect action from a superhero movie. Look at Batman Begins, X-Men: The Last Stand, My Super Ex-Girlfriend. They all had action. This movie has none. And he is supposed to be Superman. The greatest hero of all. The writing is dull. The characters are dull. The acting is dull. Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey are brilliant actors, but there was nothing for them to do in this movie. Truly sad."
5,Blue Ray has all the features that are on the standard dvd!,The previous reviewer is dead wrong! All the special features on the regular dvd are on the Blu Ray disc!!! It has really good picture quality as well.
5,A great film that touches your heart,"I really love this film, it's one of my favorite movies. It shows a more human Superman that feels and wants the things we all want: Love, Family. Brandon Routh is fantastic as The Man of Steel, he truly embodies the character the same way Christopher Reeve did in the older movies. Most of the cast if perfect, especially Kevin Spacey as Luthor. You really feel his hatred for Superman like never before. Score is wonderful and old school. It's a great story worthy of this superhero, and it feels like a classic. This is my favorite superhero film because it's more than just action and special fx; there is lots of heart and a deep story, something a lot of movies in the genre lack."
5,Superman Returns was great!,We really enjoyed this DVD and it was new and in perfect condition. We received it in two days. Thanks Amazon.
2,....Yikes,"I really looked forward to this movie, but was totally disappointed in the end. I would give this 2 1/2 (maybe 3) stars at best. Brandon Routh makes for a very handsome Superman, but he was too boring even for Clark's role. Bosworth just made me cringe as Lois. She didn't have the spunk or the look. She was boring as were her boyfriend and kid. The best cast roles were Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey as Luther and Kitty. They added some fun to this dull flick, but it's a little sad when you think that Kitty stole the show.It was still worth watching if you love Superman, just because it's a Superman movie.The effects were wonderful, the logic of the plot and action was totally flawed, and many of the lines were cheesy...but not in a fun way. This movie made me wish for the good old Superman of the 80s."
2,Horribly Mis-cast,"The storyline goes that Superman has been missing in action for over five years. You assume he had been around before that for quite some time. Yet the actor playing Superman doesn't look any older than Tom Whatshisname from ""Smallville"". Both actors don't have much charisma.The actress playing Lois Lane is totally wrong. She too looks barely out of her teens and she doesn't evoke the appearance, demeanor, or sound of the character of Lois Lane.Both actors seemed to have been picked from lowest-common-denominator box-office considerations.The basic plot idea had merits but it was only meekly developed in the film. The film makers showed absolutely no guts, let alone imagination in this abomination of a movie."
2,Superman returns ... so what?,"This movie was disappointing, but then life is full of disappointments, isn't it? I had hopes for Superman Returns, as I had enjoyed both of Mr. Singer's X-Men flicks, but this one just wasn't particularly interesting or involving. The first hour-plus is very slow, overall the story falls flat, this particular Lex Luthor is a boring villain, and there are several other problems with the movie (like things that don't make sense). The acting by Mr. Routh and Ms. Bosworth is good, but that makes little difference when it's in service of a ho-hum story. I was left thinking that just about everything that can be done with the Superman concept in movies has already been done, and it's time to put it to rest, movie-wise."
5,"Best movie ever by far, even better on blu-ray","Aside from the fact that this movie is very well done, the underlying message and philosophy Superman represents is very inspiring. I'm glad that it kept true to the original superman comics and films while bringing a fresh new perspective. Not sure if anyone cares, but superman's story in this film has a lot of parallel with teachings in Christianity in a universal nature of God.The only technical annoyance that I have about this movie is that it's shown in widescreen aspect ratio instead of taking advantage of the entire HD screen (like anamorphic DVDs). I prefer to have high-def content shown on every pixel on my 3k dollar TV, makes worth the investment. Other than that the extra features are worthwhile as well."
4,Bluray Review,"visually great bluray movie in 1080p or i, at 720 just not as sharp.5 of 5 picture.The movie3.5 of 5why? because of the vast oppinions of the people who have come to love superman, some will be pleased some wont. My review is not my oppinion but just a generalization of how overall people will feel about the film. Routh is no reeve, but he filled the shoes better than anyone else could, but many would agree that the film was to early and routh was too young. Also some alterations to the costume that will be debatable to many. Some great special effects though, an original john williams honored sound. The intro we all wanted and expected.Lastly I personally think that expectations were not quite met, the teaser trailer brought me back in time. The movie just didnt do that. Again this is only an oppinion and also is debatable.Definitley worth the buy though!!!!ok i contradicted myself! oh well"
1,all time worst superhero movie,"Superman Returns is the Batman and Robin of the Superman movies. It is just God awful. The story is horrendous and the special effects were much too over the top. As stupid as this sounds, the movie was too much like a movie. Watching Superman I, II, And IV, you just had that magical feeling like it was somehow reall. You believed a man could fly. Superman Returns fails miserably in capturing that magic.This review, however, has nothing to do with the performance of Brandon Routh as the man of steel. He gave a great perfance, despite the big shoes he had to fill. In the end Superman Returns was a giant failure for both Warner Bros. and Bryan Singer who has obviously no love for this Iconic character and even less knowledge of him."
1,SINGERMAN,"Superman Returns was poorly written and poorly cast. I much rather Tom Welling portray the man of STEEL, if you enjoyed SUPERMAN III & IV you'll love this DvD.Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut is the DvD of choice for a true SUPERMANexperience.This film is one of the worst SUPERMAN adaptation to date!"
1,nothing new,"I expected a lot more from this movie. There was nothing original about this one, if you have seen the other Superman movies (which were great) you will be bored with this one."
1,Politically correct....Why????,"I wanted so much to enjoy this new version but what happened to ""Truth, Justice and the American Way?"" There is NO American Flag or American Way. Those of us who were raised in the 50's will understand that Superman was an American hero. It's not that way any more. It seems like Warner Brothers went out of the way to make this Superman politically correct. I can not recommend this film. Everything that Superman should and did stand for is ""No More."" I was very very disappointed."
2,Brian Roth can't act,It beats me as to why someone would pour money into a big budget production and then cast a no-talent unknown as the lead.
1,Ballerina Superman!?,"Here is the low down on how this movie works:You are shown the beginning of a scenario. Then you are shown the end of that scenario, and it's up to you, the viewer, to imagine what happens in-between.This is an effective technique used in movie making. The problem is that it's the _only_ technique used in this movie. This is lazy film making. Given the high price tag of this movie, someone got ripped off big time. The viewer definitely gets short changed.But if your idea of a good action flick is to watch the main character pose during the entire movie, then, you will love Superman Returns. As for the producer, I would recommend that he move to greener pastures in the domain of drama movies.Hopefully, in the next Superman movie, we will have him actually Reach Out and TOUCH someone ... Hahaha ... Someone like the ""Doomsday/Sanction"", or better yet ... the one and only Darkseid (the only one who puts hate in the heart of the Man of Steel ;)"
1,the worst superman movie ever made,this was horrible they tried to remake the first superman movie and it did not work lex luthor is been done ONE TO MANY TIMES and to make matters worst there was no supervillian with superpowers to battle superman. i hope that the next film the is made superman fights a supervillian or more then one supervillian with superpowers. the director who did 300 is suppose to be directing the new film so it should be done right. one other thing that i hope is that all superman fans give the next film a chance. I do hope that superman fans check out allstar superman the animated film that is suppose to come out sometime next year.
3,"Superman Returns, but maybe should have stayed home","Lex Luthor plans to create new real estate with a big bang, defeat Superman with Kryptonite, and Superman tries to spark with Lois Lane. Hmm, sound familiar, it should, its the 1978 Superman movie. Could we not at least have a new plot? Performances are only average, with the exception of Brandon Routh who does a good job."
1,"The ""New"" American Way","Truth, justice and...well, they came close enough for you to know what was next, but in today's screwed-up ""PC"" world, they dare not say it. It would be more dangerous than a good dose of Kryptonite!So this is the ""new"" Superman? A fornicator who produces children out of wedlock. What a wonderful role model. Supe, you've come a long way, baby!"
3,BORIIINGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I just saw this movie; MY GOD, More then half of this movie is DAMN SOOO slow & boring! I just wants to see this movie because of ""Brandon Routh"" in spandex! He's first film and he's real cute...YA, he's real cute an all. But movie drags a lot & slow pasted till almost end of the movie got picked up some action an all, then was kind of to late. I lost the interest, Because most the movie was slow Pasted! I was accepting like spiderman series, type a high tank action, but was way to far, they push the damn love story to it to much makes it more drama then comic action hero flick!!!!!!!!!!Anyway not all that. I guess just a rental worth and seen just once, nothing more C+"
3,Superman Soars Low,"When I entered the theater for Superman Returns, this was the fist Superman movie I ever have seen in theaters, I anticipated It would be just like the other movies, comic relief, provided not much by Kevin Spacey, and justice, just like how Christopher Reeve was Superman. How Wrong was I! Clark Kent returns to earth expecting the whole world to love him and praise him, but Earth has moved on.I did not like the end of this film. I think it sets up a bad movie for the sequel. I mean come on Warner Bros. and Bryan Singer! Cut Supes some slack before giving him a son. Let ""his"" series develop not his sons.Another thing this film lacks is character development, I love Lex Luthor in this, but what this movie needs is an Otis(from the 78 Superman) and idiot that actually makes Luthor seem genius).I am just telling you if you go to see this movie don't get your hopes soaring, because I sure didn't think Superman soars in this."
1,Worst Movie EVER!,"Remember to bring a straight razor and or a noose for this movie. You will be needing it about 15 minutes into the movie. If you don't want to kill yourself, just don't watch it..."
1,Fire the writers,"This was a dissappointing film that ""borrowed"" way too much from the original film from the 70's. This unoriginal waste has the same plot from the 70's (luthor looking for real estate), the same silly luthor sidekick (Posey), and more emphasis on some super kid than on Superman. I'm surprised that they let two nobody writers take charge of America's greatest hero. They obviously had no concept of the character or else they wouldn't have had to borrow so much from previous material, especially since there is such a wealth of material out there. I hope they don't screw up Logan's Run."
3,Superman returns & turns out to be a dad (spoiler!),"Spoiler ALERT!!! Superman went away to seek his planet and returned after five years. As soon as he returns he went back doing his own thing, fighting bad guys. Lex, arch enemy of Superman, had something in his mind to rule the world which is a very typical plot of every villain for this movie. Nothing really special went on for this movie, I mean you have the bad guys doing bad stuff and some bad scenarios going on where Superman can't beat or solve. Then the movie gave some clue that Lois Lane gave birth to Superman's son - this was the story I would like to know more but the movie ended with Superman saying good night to his son."
1,Superman Returns (Two-Disc Special Edition),"The product arrived in plenty of time, but the sound on the DVD is messed up. Great service, poor product."
1,Another deadbeat dad,"Leave it to Hollywood to turn a once-virtuous Superhero - who now only believes in ""truth and justice"" but not ""the American Way!"" - into another deadbeat dad with an illegitimate kid. PHOOEY! This is precisely the reason I wouldn't see Superman II - Superman and Lois Lane in the sack? Are you kidding me? Superman oughta sue for defamation of character! George Reeves and Phyllis Coates would have seizures. This one's cape looks brown half the time - and where's the American flag? How precious to add Messianic symbolism to the affore-mentioned deadbeat with the illegitimate kid. Give me a break!"
2,I Must Have Missed Something,"I didn't see the Superman movies which came out in the 80's and that must have really threw me off for this one. It started out with me lost, and ended with me lost. There was very little character developement of anyone, from Lois to the big guy himself. I grew up watching reruns of the old show and reading the comic books, so I am relatively familiar with the basic concept of Superman and not a complete novice. Spiderman, both 1 & 2, did a much better job developing characters and moving the plot along. This one was dead in the water, which is probably where they should have left Superman so as not to kill us with having to endure another flop like this.Special effects were great. Other than that, I'll take two & a half hours of Barney with the kids over this movie."
1,This movie is boring!,"Why is superman not afraid of bullets, tall buildings, buildings tipping over, etc? Okay, he's afraid of kryptonite...oh yes, and one other thing...women. ""Oh boy...here comes Lois...oh hi Lois"" with such fright you cringe watching him interact with girls. Why is he and Spiderman (Tobey McGuire) so afraid of women they are borderline gay?!?! Who writes this crap? This movie is 154 minutes long! Of that, there is a good solid 24 minutes of actual action. The other 130 minutes is a novella of scarce dialog with Lois and Superman just nervously looking at each other waiting for someone to say something. Pure garbage! Blade rules! Stop emasculating super heroes Hollywood!"
2,So disappointed,I didn't think I'd miss the Christopher Reeve superman movies (one and two at least) and I really miss George Reeves now!!!! Those black and white Superman shows were the best!what's her name was a HORRIBLE Lois Lane!!!! The whole thing sucked - that was the second of two bad movies in a row! I don't even care about the deleted scenes! I want to sell it to someone else or at the very least - I'm going to give this one away!Brandon is cute enough but that uniform was soooooo dull!!I remember now that my brother told me I could wait for cable. I got greedy - someone bought him a DVD that was coded for another country (there was russian writing on it) and it wouldn't work in my DVD player so I got Amazon happy and ordered it from a vendor in Brooklyn.I SHOULDA WAITED FOR CABLE!
4,"Good Movie, Graphics were great!","I know that Christopher Reeves will always be remembered as Superman, but we should atleast give this movie a shot. These are new times with new technologies. Let's view the experience with an open, unbiased mind. I think there should be a new Superman movie every 2 years. I thought Tom Welling was going to be Superman though. Anyhow i still loved it."
1,Unhappy,Was unable to watch movie kept buffering and stopping very frustrating! Movies are fine unless you watch them during the evening hours which defeats the purpose
5,Superman with service,I received my package within 4 days of purchase. When I opened the package it was the wrong movie. I emailed the company I bought it from and they promptly sent me out the right movie and let me keep the original movie that was shipped.
3,Not the best,"I am still a fan of Chrirtopher Reeve. Although this was a good attempt at ressurecting the series, it was still missing the action the the older movies had."
1,2 hours 30 min. wasted,I rented this movie and boy did it suck bad acting superman only really used his powers the last 20 min. and the rest of the movie was flash backs to the first superman made in 1975. if i could give it no stars i would.
2,Sluggish & Predictable,"I am not sure what I was expecting when I rented this movie, but it definitely did not meet my expectations. The entire film was sluggish & predictable. With the plethora of great comic adaptations hitting the screen these days, I have found that films inspired by Marvel & Dark Horse comics tend to be better overall. If you have nothing else better to do you may want to watch this film...otherwise, rent something else."
2,Boring by todays standards,"I could get ""in depth"" on why this expensive movie was not entertaining to me but part of the problem is I am spoiled for entertainment. I have seen so many movies lately that ""special effects"" are not so special anymore. When a movie like this is left on it's own merit by way of story and plotline.....well the comic books have a better story. Compared to similar movies such as Batman Begins, it really fails to deliver anything original or new on the old superman theme. So wait until it's in the bargain bin if you can."
1,"The ""S"" on his chest stands for sucks","Honestly, I am a man of steel fan. I loved Superman I & II and even own the Richard Donner Cut of II. However, this is a disgrace to the man of steel. How dare they make Superman a dad, let along a dead-beat dad. It also brings to mind one of the worst lines in movie history, ""I forgotten how warm you are."" Everyone in the theater laughed at that. What, is Lois Lane in a competition with Anakin Skywalker at who can be the sappiest? Gag.As for the plot, eerily seems like Superman: The Movie's plot only instead of knocking California into the ocean They end up building land in the ocean. Same freakin' difference.This movie is an embarrassment. Don't watch it. Watch Superman I & II and like all other Supes sequels just pretend this abomination didn't happen. If there were a way to give negative stars I will. I hated this movie so much I went back to smoking. Thanks."
5,After decades...He's back,"Took long enoug. Anyway, this was one good movie. To be honest, if you are looking for action-packed scenes, then sadly you won't find it here.But if you're looking to see some amazing fly scenes and more of a traditonal ""let's see how much I can lift"" from ladies to a big giant replica of Krypton in the middle of the ocean, then this is for you. My favorite scene has to be the airplane scene in the beginning and the official ""Return of Superman."" That's some crazy flying. It had me mezmorized. Great Luthor by Spacy. OK Louis no matter how pretty. Great angle with the kid although out of wedlock, breaking the Perfect like image of Supes. Definately get it. It's Superman!! I hear in the next one Singer plans to finally make Supes brawl. Can't wait."
1,The only villain,"Like a lot of Superman fan's out there saw this at the movies and I thought this will be the best one so far, not so. Tell me something is Lex the only villain in Superman's world or is there more. Answer YES there is, why in god's name bring Lex back again and again why not bring Darkside, Brainiac, Toyman, Parasite to the big screen."
4,"It's a bird, it's a plane. He's back!","What a pleasant surprise! I expected Brandon Routh and the rest of the cast to be doing imitations of their predecessors who starred in the 70's films. Not at all! Brandon plays a sensitive, strong and spiritual Superman who is quite distinctive from Reeve's boyish Man of Steel. Kate Bosworth holds her own against Margot Kidder's classic portrayal of Lois Lane. And, man what a Lex Luthor! Kevin Spacey is comic, but extremely cruel. He doesn't give one inch to Gene Hackman. The subplot about Lois' little boy is very well done. The classic musical themes from the 70's film will make you want to cry with nostalgia. Great special effects. One caveat: the film is over 2 1/2 hours long so watch it when you can devote sufficient time to it. One last word -- Marlon Brandon's Jor-el is seamlessly integrated into the film and it really works. Superman fans will love this film!"
2,Slow... Weak... Disappointment...,"The plot was thin... The acting was so-so (though Kevin Spacey did the best he could with a weak script)... Special effects did not add much to the story. All in all, this movie was not so super, after all.Why can't Hollywood get really good script writers? They should learn a thing or two from the animated ""Batman: The Animated Series,"" ""Superman,"" ""Justice League"" and even ""Teen Titans"" writers, who have done superb jobs breathing new life into these ageless heroes."
2,Lois is a bad mom + bad script + bad casting of superman = bomb,"I was really looking forward to this movie too.. what a let down.Lois has a child.. with a father for chrissake! and superman just walks into their lives?! Being a b*tch in this flick wasn't the problem ..the fact that she goes gallivanting around.. putting her son in danger.. Worst Mother of the Year award.. that just ruined the whole movie.Brandon Routh just doesn't cut it as superman.. whereas Reeves was totally likable as both Kent and Superman.. whenever Routh grins that grin of his.. you just don't like him. Can't act, no presence, the most important character was totally mis-cast.Even Spacey couldn't rescue this horrible flick.. save your money.. go buy one of the old Superman movies. Heck, most Smallville episodes and even some of the cartoons are better than Superman Returns!"
1,Waste of film,"The first Superman movie was a great one, the second one, almost as good. But since then, it has been one disaster after another. The first four movies had the late Christopher Reeve, a very fine actor. This movie has Brandon Routh, an actor with a big grin and not much else. He is just about the sorriest actor I have ever seen. The rest of the cast was not much better. Only Kevin Spacey did his job but his part was so poorly written, it didn't really matter. This movie certainly made some money but artistically, it was a total waste of time."
4,loved this movie,"This wasn't some mindless CGI movie. This movie has a lot of heart and depth and great character development and with some touch of comedy thanks to Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey. The only problem was that there wasn't enough action or much of a villian in the movie. At first, Kate Bosworth and Brandon Rough i think were miscast because their so so young. But they carried the movie perfectly. God! Hollywood needs to make more movies like this that have a lot of heart and warmth and emotion. Superman Returns was comedic but wasn't over the top like Fantastic Four. Fantastic Four which was so stupid and dreadful. Fantastic Four was like watching a National Lampoon's meets American Pie. movie."
4,"COULD HAVE, SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER","This movie gets plenty of things right but the little kid in peril routine feels very, very old and tired. I also disliked the part of Lois' boyfriend who casually flies planes and lives in a house by the sea, too expensive looking for any non-millonaire (just like Margot Kidder's apartment in the original). The ending, featuring tons of CGI water felt way too artificial also.Still, Routh is perfect for the part and Spacey is great as Luthor. The flying effects make the ones in the old Superman feel rudimentary but after 28 years, that was to be expected."
2,Totally misrepresented with the sale,Read the description of the dvd set and got excited about the radio broadcast disc that was advertised so I ordered it.When I received the product there was no dvd it didn't have the radio dvd.Needlesss to say I was disappointed and won't be ordering from the seller again
3,Remake by stealth,"Clearly, what the director is trying to do is make a superman for a new generation of kids by stealth. The actors are made younger than what they would have been if the film had continued from the 1970s version. What is over 40 years in this movie is a five years.It has very good filming something I expected; the special effects are good. The problem is nothing is particularly original here.The story itself is as weak as the first one but at least that was original. It gets close at times to being almost the same story. The script for an adult, I do not think is particularly good. None of the characters were interesting.The acting is average.I would class it as a remake by stealth made for a new generation."
3,Entertaining but a bit long,"Superman Returns has much going for it. The action scenes are well done, Brandon Routh is very good as the man of steel and it has some good plot twists. However there are too many scenes that drag on a little too long, and the film would benefit from having about half an hour chopped out of it. Overall very enjoyable but I can't help feeling I'll be fast forwarding past some of the scenes when I watch it again."
3,"Excellent Effects, great feeling, mediocre story","I loved watching this film in the IMAX. It took my breath away. When I saw it again at home, I realized that the story was lacking.That being said--Routh does a terrific job as Supes. Spacey is (of course) incredible and Bosworth is a wet washrag. (66% on casting, eh?)"
2,Ixnay,"This Superman was souless, it did not feel like a Superman flik. Compared to the Cristopher Reeve versions, there's no competition. Hey, Brian Singer stick to X-men."
2,Why did DC allow this storyline / plot ?,"It's nice to have Superman back but why did DC comics approve the storyline / plot that was made? Superman represented ""Truth, Justice, and the American Way"", but with this movie it's ""Truth, Justice and Child Support"". Superman a deadbeat dad??? Jeeeze, who at DC comics would allow such a whacked stoyline for it's flagship comic character??? My guess is DC was sooo desperate to ward off the Spiderman/X-Men/Fantastic Four popularity they settled for a sub-par story and it's to the detriment of the fans. Brandon Routh did a credible job acting and Kevin Spacy was a good Luthor, but Kate whats-her-name was a terrible choice for Lois. All in all, ig you are a hard-core Supes fan, you'll probably want this, others should stick to Chris Reeve's versions."
1,Amazon's recommendation system is useless,"Twice I've told Amazon's recommendation system I already own this movie, yet it kept throwing it back up as a recommendation. Then I check not interested. Still Amazon's recommendation system still stupidly recommends this movie. The movie sure isn't worth buying a second copy, so Amazon is wasting my time and their opportunity to actually recommend something I might actually buy. I've written them about this problem before as this is going on with about half the stuff they recommend to me. So far they seem to be unwilling or incapable of actually doing anything to fix the problem. I guess I'll go check out the B&N website, it can't be any worse."
3,Disapointing,"I had read a lot of good reviews about this movie, so I was excited to see it. But after watching the movie I was frankly disapointed. The plot is mainley just Superman saving some more people and by the end of the movie he stays a hero. At the end of the movie I thought more would of happened, but really Superman didn't even go on that many exciting adventures. It may be time to give up the Superman sequels, because this movie was a major disapointment."
3,the 1st one was better,"thats right!i said it!sure the real estate scam thing on the old one was corny but its better than a long,drawn out plot that only really gets cool right at the end.if they couldnt come up with a cool plot than they shouldve re-christened tim burtons throw away project where he fights doomsday.all im saying is it didnt really fit into any one catagory too well because it lacked in so many areas.i mean ,ffs,dont pay actual money to watch it.i liked it least of any super hero movies ever made including elektra,tv movies and all the bat-mans.i mean unless youre in live with superman,just skip it."
2,Back to the Future,"Superman in the 21st century just doesnt work.Most of the film is based on a cheezy romance. Mrs Lane struts around for the first half, selfishly peeved about being dumped ""why the world doesn't need superman"", but our pig-tailed greesy superhero had a superexcuse. And eventually he weezles his way back into her heart, 'picks her up' literally. It seems superman, in his endeavour to get a superkiss, doesnt have supermorals about breaking up a family.Meanwhile Mrs Lane doesnt know who the father of her son is.Welcome to the 21st century Superman saga.In that tradition, I would've liked to see superman have a go at the middle east crisis. A much more fun prospect, than a one dimensional bad guy on the hunt for the next big Kryptonite.Hopefully in the next sequel, Superman's son turns bad from all the psycholoical damage, and we will see our green guy Yoda make a celebrity appearance as the ultimate kryptonite hero.!?..... in the tradition of destroying great classic comic stories."
2,Suprman Returns... Not All Good,"I generally liked the movie, but why can't the Liberal Hollywood agenda take a break? Why did they have to have Lois Lane pregnant out of marriage?They went out of their way to advance their agenda, instead of making a movie all Superman fans and others could watch without any moral objections!Dukes of Hazzard remake had to have pot at the end, etc.I heard they are going back to the drawing board and remaking Superman again.This time fellas, just make a great movie, and keep your liberal agenda out of it.They had Lois get pregnant out of wedlock, but they decided to hide Superman's real-sized 'package'.Seems inconsistent to me."
2,he should have just stayed where he was,"The adventure is acceptable enough, but what's with the adultery theme?This outing sees Lois Lane virtually married to another man. Nevertheless, the Man of Steel (whom I had thought above such things), uses his X-ray vision to spy on her, leer at her, hold her, take her for unsupervised romantic night flights, etc. Would you still feel okay watching this if Lois were your wife?Yeah, something was not right about this. This whole thing gave me an uncomfortable feeling because you got the idea that Superman was wrongly trying to reclaim fields he had forsaken.Another bummer was the script never really let Kevin Spacey take off like you know he could have."
1,Worst ever,"This was the worst big-budget super-hero flick ever made. A total misunderstanding of the character by the writers, poor acting by the lead, no humor at all. Pretentious and dull."
2,Underwhelming,"Just couldn't compare to Smallville or even the first Superman. Mildly interesting story line, but basically ho hum. Brandon Routh suffers by comparison both to Christopher Reeves and to Tom Welling. What was the point of making this movie?"
1,Superman Returns For Another Dreadful Film,"Well, after almost 20 years of no superman on the big screen, this is how he returns? He should have stayed in space looking for Krypton(one of the many ridiculous plot points of the film). This film is calling itself an homage to the '78 original, but is indeed a pitiful remake. No originality whatsoever in this pathetic, stupid, waste of what...$250,000,000??? I didn't see $250,000,000 on the screen at all, more like $250,000. Playstation game effects, not convincing at all. So, if your under 13, or of that mentality, you'll love this trash. If not get ""Superman II-The Richard Donner Cut"" to see a real superman movie, THE superman film of the year. Superman Returns SUPER SUCKS!"
2,Lifeless and dull...big disappointment,"I'd heard lots of good buzz about this movie and in interviews, all of the cast and crew said the right things.Unfortunately, this movie is a huge disappointment (for me at least). Despite numerous references and homages to Superman(1978), this movie has none of the exuberance or charm of the first two Superman movies.The main problems are casting and the script: Routh lacks sufficient charisma as Superman and Bosworth is completely wrong for the role of Lois Lane. Even Kevin Spacey's performance as Luthor is wrong- it's (intentionally) too similar to Hackman's.Also, I can't believe that Singer would spend ~$200 million on a movie without a decent script or storyline. Roger Ebert describes the movie as ""lifeless""- I couldn't agree more- I couldn't stop checking my watch.Bottom line: better than Superman III and IV, which isn't saying much."
2,Something was missing....,"I think the story was a bit ridiculous. How did they manage to find Superman in the ocean. What resources would Lex Luther have living on top of a lump of coal. Why does this superman look younger thank the last even though it's 6 years later. I feel that it has all been done before, and I wanted to love it."
2,Not so good.,"Bryan Singer would have done better completing the ""X"" trilogy. Seriously miscast and inconsitent in tone. Williams' score and the slavish main titles, several of which are virtually unreadible, should have been jettisoned. The music certainly doesn't fit with John Ottman's new notes (Ken Thorne did a better job integrating Williams in SII). But, this is symptomatic of the schizophrenia of this attempt. When we learn that Lois has won The Pulitzer (for a single editorial, yet), my jaw dropped. Was this meant to be satirical, reflecting the diminished standards in all aspects of modern life? Lois was always ambitious and agressive, but was she ever meant to be taken seriously as a journalist? J.P. must be rolling. By the way, I agree with the guy who felt Parker Posey would have been the right choice for Lois."
2,Blows huge chunks...,"Let me say simply not to waste your time unless you are extremely bored or find sitcoms on the WB intellectually engaging.This was a pretty sad effort from the word go. LAME! LAME! LAME! The only thing giving it one star above 1 was the return of the stellar score, Kevin Spacey and the presence of Kate Bozworth's fine a** as the wholly unlikable biotch, Lois Lane ;-)"
4,SUPER and very impressive!,"The movie is awesome! The reason why I only rate it 4 because the movie is too long to be a superhero movie. It made me sitting in the thater for almost 3 hours. But it doesn't matter to me how long it is. The special effects is great. Unlike you've never seen it. You can't tell if DC is better than Marvel or Vice Versa. Bryan (Singer)is a great director. Impressive for being a whole new story. I can say that PG-13 is the right rating for this movie, because there too much violence if younger kids watch it. It will be a bit scary if it's in 3-D. More on Superman, this is a great movie for the new generation. This is the first Superman movie i've ever watched. I'm planning to watch the first four.Again, it's great and impressive."
5,Superman Rocks!,"I saw SR a few days ago, and I love it!! The effects are amazing, the acting is fantastic, and it's just an overall great movie to watch.Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth are awesome, and James Mardsen is great, too! Poor guy, though, he never seems to get the girl. Not as Scott Summers or Richard White. Pffft. Oh well. Too bad for him.Moving on, I thought it was superb! Go see it!"
4,Well I liked it.,Brandon Routh made a good Superman. Kate Bosworth made a great Lois Lane. I liked the story line so much that I upped my stars from 3 to 4.
5,Worth watching many times,The Man of Steel has returned ... Clark is cute and Lois is slightly annoyingly independent. Actor Brandon Roth delivers an unearthly purity and he is everything Superman should be and even more. He will be the Superman of our generation. Superman has returned and is flying high. Warms hearts and worth watching at least twice.
4,Great come back for the superman series,"I was a little worried about the new superman because the guy they got to play superman physically doesn't look like superman. He just isn't muscular enough. But when I actually saw the movie, he did a really good job. The movie had great special effects, good story, and some comedic moments. Another plus of the movie was Kevin Spacey's great portrayal of the criminal genius Lex Luthor. All in all, this movie is definitely recommended to go see, as well as to purchase when it comes out."
2,Superman #1 still the best,"Although many years ago, Chris Reeves in Superman #1 was still the best of all--Superman Returns has some good computer effects, but the final part with the crystals growing out in the ocean was too boring and too far out....like ""Oh, come on!""For some Superman fun...go out and rent the original movie on a DVD!"
4,A New Beginning,"This was an excellent revival of the franchise. I hope it will be the last time Lex Luthor is in a Superman movie, he is an over used villian. I was surprised about Lois and Superman having a son together, but it makes sense from the perspective of reviving the franchise 20 years from now. It would be nice to see other DC superheros in the future movies."
3,Superman Returns DVD movie.,"I am not A Super Man fan, but I thought the movie was good, except Kevin Spacey who I can't stand due to his political stance. So it was Appropriate for him to be the Villain in my opinion.Overall though the movie is enjoyable to watch. I give it 3-4 1/2 stars."
2,Hmmmm,"Sorry to tell you Blu ray Fans but this looks WAY WAY better about 10 times better on HD than Bluray The color is way off and it gets to dark at times, the HD is Right on the money, the water looks Amazing. Sorry but it does look better in HD, so if you have an HD player go get this in HD, because it Sucks on the ps3. ok so i was wrong, shoot me"
2,boring story but great special effects,"Special effects were great, but the first half was pretty slow and there were some attempts at humor, but it was not very funny at all...also he didnt use his superbreath to freeze anything! Why?! I saw many instances in which he could have used his superbreath to solve problems much easier."
4,good job so far,"Ok now i won't compare Brandon Routh to Christopher Reeve nothing will ever compare to Reeves..i think Brandon Routh did a good job on his own and i'm glad they picked a no name actor that we didn't know to play superman...About the movie i thought it was good i know they are going to do a sequel so i hope its even great not good..this movie was good for me because even though there was action i would have like to have seen more but i undersatnd that this is to show when he returns so everybody is getting use to everybody thats why i hope the sequel will be better, but over all good job on both the actors and movie..Last note, I hope that everybody gives this movie a chance and though i love Christopher Reeves darely i hope the audience have an open mind and aren't stuck in Christopher Reeves mode..."
3,Movie Review~,"It was good but I noticed in one scene they totally replaced SuperMan with an animated SuperMan that looked like something off of the SHREK movie. It was a scene where they could of had a real person, he was just standing and looking around like a cybersex doll."
1,Bad Disc,"Not sure why, but this disc will not play on any of my bluray payers. I seem to remember playing it when I first bought it, but the last few times I tried, it won't even recognize as a valid disc. Have heard of others with this problem on various forums, but since it's been almost four years since purchase, out of luck. I would gather that the company had a bad run of discs, and that they decided not to recall them because not enough people complained. And since I did not complain in time, I don't count."
3,Poor quality not real blu-ray,"I bought this because I love the superman movies and thought the blu-ray version would be the full 1080p experience but unlike blu-ray for newer movies such as The Dark Knight, etc this quality really sucks big time. It almost looked like they up-converted it to ""blu-ray"" and it is no better than DVD quality. I should have expected this given that this film started filming back in 2004. Even the extras were only 720 interlaced....Basically, waiting for Superman 2013"
2,Insufferable,Weak points:* Everyone looks plastic* The pace is constipated* The writing is insipidStrong point:* Kevin Spacey?
3,Truth or Lie,I bought this item twice. I really wanted the lenticular cover but didn't get it the first time. I bought it used and I do not recommend buying an used one. I bought it again new and it came with the lenticular cover that I was supposed to get the first time I bought it.
3,Yawner,"Sure, Kevin Spacey chews up the screen in this return of the big fella but while some of the shots are nice Superman appears to be a bit of a stalker as he hovers around to check out Lois Lane's comings and goings. The boy appears to be his son. A try, made a few bucks."
3,Could be Great but is only ok,I was really hoping this movie to be great but is only ok. And please no nore Lex Luthor. They can make a great superman movie without luthor as main criminal ( doomsday anyone )
2,Unsatisfying,"I found the story and the ending unsatisfying. First of all, the disasters just seemed like they were put there to give Superman something to do. Secondly, I don't like how Superman never, ever really gets the girl (Lois Lane). And I don't like how he never kills Lex Luthor. Lex just keeps coming back to cause more trouble, and Superman keeps coming back to defeat him. And you know that these issues will never be resolved because D.C. Comics wants to keep everything the same. If they make another movie, I would at least like to see Superman fight other villains, because I'm really sick of Lex Luthor. I would say this is the least satisfying of all the Superman movies."
4,Very Enjoyable,"This version of the Superman legend is truly enjoyable. Brandon Routh does a good job playing the Man of Steel and Kate Bosworth plays a modern Lois Lane. Kevin Spacey does not come up to snuff as Lex Luther, but the action sequences are very good. Overall, I enjoyed watching this movie."
4,Superman Returns Re-released version 2008 (BLU RAY),"If you are very particular with video and audio quality, then this re-released version is much superior than the early release in 2006. I don't understand why many studios cannot get it right the first time! They would sell so many more blu-ray dvd's if they did so! I think the extra time taken to ensure that the video and audio quality is reference material will be well worth it (that is one of the reasons blu-ray owners buy blu-ray intead of regular dvd). I have made the mistake of buying some blu-ray dvd's and found that the quality was not much of an improvement over the regular dvd. I do understand that technology has changed since 2006 but have seen some blu-ray dvd's that were almost reference material."
5,A welcome return for DC Comics staple hero!,"I was not even born when the original ""Superman"" movies were made and released with the late Christopher Reeve, plus I've been pulled towards the Marvel Comics movies historically speaking so I didn't know what to expect with the first ""Superman"" movie of the 21st century, 2006's ""Superman Returns"". I however got lucky and was invited to see this on July 1 and ultimately in the end, ""Superman Returns"" has truly lived up to the great reviews that I've been reading all across the net since it's release to the theatres. Benefiting from the likes of ""X-Men"" movie director Brian Singer, this has turned out to be a major favorite movie of 2006 so far.On the planet Krypton, Superman is sent away from there and escapes just in time before it's `sun' star collapses and then explodes in a supernova destroying the planet with it's civilization perishing in the disaster but Superman escapes and reaches earth."
3,Marshall Law,"Good debut EP, but Obsession's best album by far is ""Methods of Madness"". Also check out Mike Vescera's first album with Loudness, ""Soldier of Fortune"". Good effort."
1,Abosolutely lousy,More references to other writings than the authors own thoughts. Difficult to follow very bad choice.
5,Wonderful reading! Inspiring and educational.,"This book will take you on a trip through various churches and centuries-old cathedrals with the author as he describes what he sees in vivid detail. Meet the people he encounters, learn the history of the landmarks and tiny villages, feel the wind blow through your hair as the author points out the spiritual truths that go unnoticed today through a superb writing style and meticulous illustrations of some of Europes most enchanting places."
5,Another saved pop song...,"Manson did it for Sweet Dreams and once again he recreates the feel of another formally rather bland 80's pop song. Manson is so incredibly creative, he really gives this song new life and new meaning for The Not Another Teen Movie soundtrack. If you get to see the video for it, it is a real treat. All the actors from the movie appear in it and in character. (The DVD for the movie includes the video and a segment on the making of the video, which is also a real treat) Manson is trully an innovator. A must-have for any fan's collection. This cd inc. 2 other songs from the movie and Manson's Suicide is Painless."
1,Sigh,"Tainted Love was not bland, and Suicide is Painless isn't Manson's song. He is not creative, hence his need to constantly do covers and ruin great songs in the process."
4,Good to read up on for becoming a better writer,"A good review of the key points for writing a better story. Nowadays it seems marketing is all about story and connecting better with people. Shows how to tap into emotions and work the reader so they are continually seeking more.I liked what I read and will practice this. Another great story book is ""Wired for Story."" Forgot the author but is easy to look up with title. That was probably my favorite I checked out from the library."
4,UH-OH,"Uh-Oh is a great CD. It really has the feeling of being at a CM show, with it's loud, in-your-face sound. Although not lyrically their best, you can tell that the band had a fun time recording it. It's definitely worth checking out!"
4,Uh Oh!,"The title alone doesn't signify what this CD is all about. Although there is no throwing-spoons-on the stage songs like ""Everybody Loves Jill,"" the title track ""Uh Oh"" is catchy enough that even my six year old fell in love with it instantly! And if that song doesn't get your feet taping, ""Friends"" will.It oozes pure Cowboy Mouth. Put it in your CD player, turn the volume up, sing at the top of your lungs in true Fred-fashion, and hurry to their next concert! ;)"
2,Disappointing,"Not what I had hoped for. I love Cowboy Mouth and never miss a chance to see them in concert, but there newest album isn't up to par with me. They need to go back to their roots."
4,Greatness and Consistency,"The greatness of Cowboy Mouth is in the writing, the insightfulness, the hooks and the musicianship...and it all comes together on Uh Oh! Though not as great as their masterpieces, this is a fantastic disk...it's like when you get only an Ok picasso...All the tracks are good times...reminding you to live life to the fullest and enjoy the good and bad times.Great Driving Disk..."
4,Typical Wonderful Cowboy Mouth,"I ran right out and bought this CD the day it came out. Cowboy Mouth has a history of creating upbeat rock tunes that make you feel good during car rides. This CD has a whole new feel with the same CM musical style. Some of the songs are blatent in sexual references which is fairly new to them, but many of the songs are the catchy type that you don't mind getting stuck in your head. Just the songs ""Friends"" ""Uh-oh"" and ""Tell the Girl"" are worth the [money] alone. If you enjoy even a few of their songs I recommend this disk, and whole-heartedly recommend that you see them in concert. The band totally includes the audience in their shows."
2,Lacks the magic of his prior releases,"As a fan who loves his Oeuvre cd, and gives that a 5 out of 5, this cd is shockingly disappointing. In Oeuvre he manages to take quirky loops and make them hooks with excellent backing music. This has the same formula, but no success. ""He's a skull"" starts off decent, until the vocal sample ""he's a skull"" comes in. The track ""Jennifer"" is cringe-worthy, and the rest of the cd ranges from medicore house to interesting, but not compelling listening. Q-burns has the talent to make great music, but this doesn't really show it. Stick to his Oeuvre or Hawke's ""Namaquadisco."""
2,Disappointed,"Well....I am not a professional reviewer or writer. However, I was expecting something totally different from what I got. I have read stories that were much, much better done than this one. The concept was, however, fantastic--too bad the author couldn't have capitalized better on this idea. I have always been leary of books with no publisher or any other info other than the author's name. I would be willing to bet that this Robin L. Hutton was in high school when the book was written. I don't know why so many people raved about this book."
1,"Great Idea, Poor design!","I bought this item because I also thought it was a great idea. I have a 20 month old and a 1 month old. I first tried to use it on my 20 month old and it was useless. I thought maybe it would work better on my newborn, it didn't! There is just not enough pressure to wash the soap off (especially from the hair)The temperature guage didn't work at all and the sprayer leaked from the side. I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing. Luckily, I was able to return it to the store with no problems."
1,whatever you do - dont waste your money!!!,"I thought this was such a great idea - and my baby loves water so I thought it would be perfect. I wish I would have read the reviews on it before buying. Its going back!!! Its horrible. It leaked on my counter, the button to get it to spray was hard to push, then it would get stuck and keep spraying. By the time I was done giving my baby a bath, there was water all over my kitchen. This is a wonderful idea but a horrible product."
1,Resist the Temptation,"I received this for a shower gift. I loved it after the first couple uses because the water temperature was always perfect (due to the built in thermometer) and the water pressure wasn't too forceful for my little one. After about the fourth or fifth use, I went to give my baby a bath and the water would not come out. I could hear the motor running but no water was coming out. I would have just thought that I got a defective one, but from reading everyone elses on-line review, it seems that none of them work properly!"
1,"Great concept, poor execution.","This handheld shower was a way cool idea! I was so excited about it that we decided to register for it for our second child, while wishing we had had it for our first, and got it as a gift. It worked fine the first time. It got finicky the second and third times, and then stopped working altogether. Why can't people who design children's products make sure they work for more than a week before releasing it on the market?"
1,While I never owned this product.....,Thanks to all the reviewers I didn't waste my money on this product. While I never owned this product I do know something that you can use instead. Bathe your baby in the kitchen sink most have sprayers on them already.(even better if you have a double sink.)You can have the baby on one side and the other side you can have the water at the temp you want to rinse the baby off all without taking your hands off of her(him). It worked great with my three kids.
4,No problems with mine,"I put this on my registery before I read all the reviews. When I got it, I was a little nervous, but thought I would keep it and see if I encountered any problems with it....and I did not.I've used it a bunch of times now and it works perfectly. More importantly, my son loves it!I found the spray to be just the right amount. I can't imagine why anyone would want it stronger because it comes out well enough to rinse off the baby and can easily be controlled to avoid getting water in baby's eyes.I would recommend this product, but I will admit that it isn't a necessity. It's definitely one of those silly items new parents want to get."
1,What a Waste!,"This is a great concept but the design is terrible. I loved the idea of having clean rinse water right at hand while giving my son a bath, and figured that a shower sprayer would make it easy to avoid getting soap and water in his eyes. When I used it the first time, I was surprised at the odd shape. It did not hook to our infant tub or regular bath tub. I was able to work around the size issue, but when I started to use it, the ""spray"" was way too light. My son has a good bit of hair, and this took a long time getting all of the soap out. I actually had to refill it! I used it three times, then it just stopped working!! I don't know if changing the batteries would help (although only getting 3 uses on brand new batteries seems ridiculous), but it just hasn't been worth the effort. The stupid thing is just sitting on the counter, and I will probably just throw it away.Short answer: If you are considering this product, just don't bother. It really is not worth the hassle!"
1,Terrible product!!!,"I wish I looked at the previous reviews before I bought this. The product is a good idea, but terribly constructed. It is battery operated and even with brand new batteries, the water pumping is minimal. I tried it once and it sprayed out so gently that it tickled my daughter. Not a chance that it would have rinsed her hair out. The temperature gauge doesn't work at all. Finally, the spray stopped coming out when it was only 1/3 of the way down from the top. I decided to package it up and take it back to the store the same day. When I was drying it off and repackaging it, I discovered that water was inside the battery compartment. Perhaps that is why it stopped working? Definitely NOT worth the money. Save your $17, go to the beauty supply and buy a spray head that fits onto your faucet. I bought one today and it cost $2.99."
1,owned 3 and none of them worked,"I originally bought the one with the tub. The tub and sling are great but after 2 uses of the shower unit it didnt work. So I bought the shower unit seperately and guess what? After 2 uses of that it didnt work. Unfortunatly since I didnt have the receipt anymore, I couldnt return it. Because I figured what are the chances of two of this product not to work. So I contacted the Maker ( the e-mail address is on the instructions) and told her the problem They Immediatly offered to send a FREE replacement. I was so happy. Until I got it and used it. This time it only worked 1 time and the next time it didnt. It makes noises but no water comes out. The batteries were all new. So I know it CAN NOT possible be something I'm doing wrong. IT is obviously a BAD PRODUCT. It was a good idea though.DO NOT BUY THIS."
1,Worked great...ONCE,"This product is a waste of money. It worked great ONLY the first time we used it...and it hasn't worked since! Several friends saw I registered for it and did the same, but I'm telling them to get a cheaper tub instead and use a cup for rinsing."
3,Clapton's Guitar: Watching Wayne Henderson Build the Perfect Instrument,"I enjoyed the book and the reverance of the author of the Subject of this book and his skills, but I am sure that Eric Clapton has purchased and played so many good guitars in his life and must feel equally enamored with those other guitars. He has reverted to his blues and his acoustic guitar talents and surely, at this stage of his career must feel he only needs this one guitar and all, Oh, he still has other guitars, well then. I still enjoyed the book."
5,A must have book!!,"This is a delightful book that was a joy to read. It is filled with real life characters and stories that were endearing and very entertaining. I'd love to meet Wayne Henderson; I kind of feel I know him already.If you're looking for a book that will keep a smile on your face, look no further. Major props to St John."
5,Clapton's Guitar: Reading About a Great Instrument Luthier,"Due to the fast pace of life in the twenty-first century, I rarely take the time to read a book from cover to cover anymore. This book was an exception. It is hard not to appreciate the artistry and care with which Wayne Henderson builds each instrument as we are introduced to life in Rugby, Virginia. The depictions of Wayne's rural friends and their attitudes is in stark contrast to the modern lifestyles in big cities, which is where, according to the author, one might be more likely to locate a vintage guitar. I enjoyed learning that Wayne is not only a great luthier, but also a highly accomplished guitar player. I honestly had not heard of him as a music artist prior to reading this book, but after checking out the web links of samples in the appendix, it is easy to believe that Wayne Henderson knows exactly what a perfect instrument should be!"
5,"I'm not a musician, but I love this book","""Clapton's Guitar...."" is an excellent tale of craftsmanship, personal values, and folk lore. The building of the guitar, provides a backdrop for a character study of Wayne Henderson and his friends- you definitely don't need to be a guitarist, to enjoy this book. You may find some of the technical terms (like the model numbers of some of the different types of guitars) unfamilar - I did, but it's not really distracting. More than once, I found myself yearning to visit the shop and just sit and take in the sights and sounds of the work and the people who frequent the shop."
5,How to build a guitarr and laugh while your doing it.,This was a very informative as well entertaining book. I enjoyed reading immensely. I highly recommend this book to anybody whether you are interested in guitars or not. There are good passages that describe the life style of the Blue Ridge mountains area and the people who live there.
3,Very Musical,"This is a great book if you are interested in how acoustic guitars are made, or playing guitars, or Eric Clapton, or Bluegrass Music, or baseball.The writing style is good enough that I started hearing these guitars even before they were made. Oh wait that was the radio.It makes for a great read, but it would have been even better if Allen could make himself a little more transparent. He keeps wanting to write himself into the story. I know he was the catalyst for the whole deal, but I don't really care about where he went to college, and numerous other factoids which don't add value to the story, at least not for me.Thanks, Steve Willie, Olympia, WA"
3,Good story; irritating writing,"This is a good story of a master craftsman who is surrounded by engaging personalities in a 'down-home', authentic environment that many of us long for. However, the author's style of writing is particularly grating. He seems to be writing as though he were a 22-year-old college senior who is looking to impress other 22-year-old boys. I am actually surprised that the sentence ""Dude!"" didn't appear in the book; it would have fit right in. Again, the story is really quite good, and there are a lot of details that the author described vividly to evoke a sense of place and personality. I just wish he could grow up and write for adults."
2,Kinda left you hanging??,I thought the ending was weak. Wayne goes to get his mail. St John drops the guitar off to a Tech and does St. John ever get the guitar he ordered and was it worth the wait? Very weak ending...
3,Is what it is.,"It is an inexpensive tool box. Saying it is hardwood is kind of an overstatement. I wanted a good starting point to build a storage box, and this worked well. I couldn't have built this much for the price."
5,Sisco MTV7 tool chest,"It's an impressive product for the money.It's mostly solid wood, a little plywood with pressboard for drawer bottoms."
1,Sisco utility chest - poor workmanship,"The workmanship of this chest is poor. Two of the drawer bottoms sag - the staples holding the bottom in were dislodged. The staples had been carelessly inserted, defacing the inside drawer backing. The drawer pulls are missing. One drawer side is made of rough crude lumber with no sanding or finishing. The upper right front was crudely fitted - the gap was poorly filled with wood filler."
3,Worth the Price,"If you are expecting a finely tooled, expertly crafted tool box at this price you will be sorely dissapointed. What you will get is a box that is a good art box, craft box, or hobby box at a price that you could not build yourself. The drawer fit is not comparable with a chest costing $$$$. The overall look is impressive for what you pay. In short, you get a fairly good value for the money."
2,Don't treat it like it's real...,"The handles are held on with 3/16"" long screws into veneer. They fell out, the box hit the floor and it shattered all over the place. It's a cheap POS. Buy one for another hundred bucks, it's gotta be better..."
3,Not a Tool Box,"Don't get me wrong this is an excellent value but like many Chineseimports they appear to be designed from a photograph never seeing the real thing!Several things such as the lack of ""locking drawers"" when carrying make this impractical as a real tool box. Also drawers are a little light weight for most heavy tools. I could see this being used as a parts organizer in a workshop, or in an office for drafting tools and supplies. Could be more useful in the home as a desk or collectable organizer (ie. stamps, coins,)."
5,Just like good old Dad's,"I ordered this tool box because it so closely resembles the one issued by my father when he began his apprenticeship program as a machinist for the New York Central Railroad in 1925. That box followed him through apprenticeship, journeyman, master machinist and Assistant Superitendent of the Locomotive Shop when he died in 1956 (at age 49!) My mother sold off all of dad's tools, his gun collection and just about every thing else that could be attributed to him. It makes me feel really good (now that I;m retired from a career as an accountant and finding an interest in woodworking to be able to acquire somethis so much like Dad's."
5,Great Purchase,"I looked at the measurements very closely prior to purchasing. Therefore I was not surprised at the large size of this utility chest. I also went to a web site called Stacks and Stacks and purchased jewelry trays to fit inside the drawers of the utility chest. Again, I had to look closely at the measurements, because the chest will hold only one large jewelry tray (very top level of chest)...but it will hold two small jewelry tray in each drawer."
1,Not Even Worth $50,"Read the reviews for the discontinued chest -- all applies here. This is a cheap, shoddily constructed fiberboard chest which arrived with a crushed corner, separation of one side, and drawer bottoms that look like little more than cardboard with green felt flocked on. One of the front and one of the back hinges were installed crooked, and I didn't need a laser to see that.Don't buy this, and if you do, do what I did -- return it the next day. This isn't worthy of Amazon, unless they want to sell it as ""seconds merchandise"" for $5-10, including shipping."
1,I expected junk -- got what I wanted.,"Luckily, I bought this box with the intention of stripping it and replacing all of the hardware. Don't buy this if you want a useable chest out of the box. The hardware is ill-fitting. The latches do not hold, even when I re-aligned them and put in new screws. They were crooked, and were missing one screw each. There were two other screws missing from the corner guards. One additional screw was bent beyond usefulness. I feel sorry for anyone who was expecting something nicer. Like I said, I am lucky that my expectation were low to begin with. All of the hardware is in the trash, and I've sanded off most of the cheap varnish. About $.. in hardware and paint (and wood filler to fill the screw holes) will make this look good."
3,Wish I'd read the reviews before I bought it...,"I actually bought two of these, one for myself, and one for my father as a birthday present. Having little time to get him something else, he got the box... but it wasn't easy. I had to take the best parts from both of them to make one good one.Specifically, the stain on the drawers was very inconsistent, and half of the drawer knob hardware was of such a poor quality that it would not tighten all the way, leaving the knobs to spin or dangle. I ended out gluing them onto the one I kept... I probably should have just sent it back.I don't think that the overall item is worthless, but I am very disappointed... Live and learn."
2,"Loved the idea, not the item...","I saw this style chest in a local hardware store last fall, and fell in love with it. When I saw one like it here for half the price, I jumped on it. Thought I would get more once I had one, there are endless uses! Unfortunately, it was cracked along the right side, so I returned it, and received the replacement the next day! (The packaging is really good and had nothing to do with the damage.) I opened the replacement to find another crack in the same place. So, I have opted for the refund. Maybe they will have them at the hardware store again this year.Also disappointed that there was no handle on the top, and no way to secure the drawers if you planned to move the chest."
4,Nice Chest,These are great for storing small items but beware that if you use them to store silver they will coat and tarnish yellow from the lacquer used to seal the wood. They are nicely made otherwise.
4,I can't believe these negative reviews!!!,"When I decided to purchase this chest, I had real reservations based on the negative reviews. Well, I got mine in the mail today and I LOVE IT! It's exactly what I expected. No, it's not solid oak with real brass and velvet...those chests cost hundreds of dollars, remember? But it's heavy, sturdy, NOT broken, bent, cracked, whatever else they said about it. It's real wood, and just perfect for my tools. I'm ordering the smaller model next. If you don't want to pay a lot and you want a great storage chest, this is your best buy!"
5,Makes a great jewelry chest,"It took three smaller jewelry box contents!I bought this instead of an armoire because I didn't have room for an armoire. Considering that most armoires have small drawers, this utility chest holds just as much if not more. I like that the drawers have no dividers. That way even large pieces can fit in without any problems."
1,You get what you pay for!,"Very cheaply made! Terrible smell, guess that will go away once the oils dry! Drawers fit poorly and will fall out if you are not carefull. ""Brass"" hardware is plated in most areas and are poorley attached. ""Wood"" vener already coming loose. Look elsewhere if you want any kind of quality!"
3,"OK ,But Check Out The Original Band First","The Groundhogs in their original incarnation were the best heavy white boy blues rock band EVER ! What you have hear is (genius, virtuoso) guitarist Tony McPhee with some new sidemen, circa 1987, originally known as the Tony McPhee Blues Band, then switching over to the name Groundhogs. The bassist and drummer are totally inferior to the originals Cruickshank and Pustelnick. Although Tony can still wring the neck with best of them, many of these arrangements just simplify the tunes, probably because these sidemen didn't quite cut it, to pull the original sound off. ""Mistreated"" is almost unrecognizable from the great version on Blues Obituary."
1,Poor packaging-,The cloths leaked and were usless upon arrival. WHen I complained they wanted me to send the ruined cloths back. What a pain! Very disappointed.
2,Not right for me,"I'm just above average on the ""member size"", so the couple times I used these they felt like my johnson was having the life choked out of it, which actually made it feel like I temporarily lost some sensation- which can't be good."
3,TMobile Travel Charger,"excellent, I think that this product meets the expectations which I bought, in addition, I recommend it as a product of very good quality."
1,Bad Scale,"All we wanted was a decent-looking analog scale that was accurate. This isn&#65533;t it.My daughter and I each got on the scale several times and the weights it showed varied by about 40 pounds. My weight went from 198 to 235, with a few stops in between. The item delivered may have been defective, but it didn&#65533;t appear to be damaged. Considering the huge overall size and relative light weight of this thing, I&#65533;ll just conclude that it&#65533;s a .. piece of junk. Mine is being returned for a refund."
3,Had to buy this for an old Olympus,"It works. That's all I can say. It is slow, but this is pre-SD and the camera is pre USB, so I can't complain much. Terrible value, though. I guess that's what you get for buying obsolete technology."
4,Delivered as promised,"The product is as described, and it arrived in a timely fashion. No problems whatsoever. Recommend the vendor. Great job."
3,Heavy Tome.,"So far so good! However, I gave it 3 stars because the paper quality is not great and the size of the book makes it difficult to handle."
3,NY Times Puzzle Book,"I love crossword puzzles! This book is too awkward to use though for two reasons. One is that it's heavy and hard to hold open anywhere except at a table (my favorite spot is the recliner or lawn chair!). The second reason is that the puzzle is on the wrong part of the page. It should be near the binding or even in the middle with the clues surrounding it. Again, it wouldn't be as bad at the table, but that's not where I do them.The puzzles are great though!!"
4,Keeps your brain healthy and active,"This is a motherlode of crosswords for the crossword lover. For the majority of the book, the hardness of the puzzles are randomly distributed. It is my understanding that the last 150 puzzles, they are distributed from easy to hard.I highly recommend this collections of crosswords, especially because The Puzzle Master (of NPR and New York Times fame), Will Shortz edited the collection. For me the most challenging part of the puzzles is remembering the simple words, rather than banging my head against the wall over more difficult words. As with all of Shortz's puzzles, he is not pleonastic. This will give your brain that will help it to beat Alzheimers and dimensia due to the universal inevitability of aging."
2,Hard To Believe How Much I Don't Like This Book,"I've done many puzzles. Some too easy. Some too hard. This one is in a category all by itself. A collection of puzzles that you would think were created by a person who was English language impaired. Really. Not tough - just odd. People who have picked up this book at my home to do a puzzle or two inevitably said, ""These are strange puzzles - I don't like them."" New York Times is what it says on the cover. I am puzzled. (A pun.)"
2,1001 NYT Puzzles,"The puzzles are OK, but most of them are very simple and not really worth doing. I am a fairly accomplished puzzler, and I find most of the puzzles too trivial to spend time on."
4,MY BRAIN IS YOUNG!,"My grandson LOVES this one, because there are 1,001 puzzles that we can do together! He is amazed at how much Grandma Fran knows!"
3,Could be better,This book does not specify which day of the week the puzzle was originally published in the NYT. It also doesn't include any larger Sunday puzzles. Print is very small as well.
3,Crosswords Good For the Brain,Didn't know puzzles would be so small. It's difficult to see clearly and fill small squares for an old girl me (79)!
4,Purchased as a gift,"Lots of puzzles for a reasonable price. Print is clear. Paper is cheap, but certainly adequate and better than newsprint."
4,Dangerous Product,This book contains an absurdly large amount of high quality puzzles. Do not buy this product if you are the kind of person who will have trouble putting it down unless you truly have nothing else to do.Some of the very hard puzzles have clues and/or answers containing words that I can't find in any dictionary.
2,Too big & bulky,"I bought this crossword puzzle book & I'm sorry I did. It is extremely big & heavy & bulky . I thought I would just tear out the sheets individually, but after awhile that doesn't work either."
3,Guggenheim Museum Promo?,"If climbing on and jumping off internal Guggenheim Museum balconies constitute a very plot of a five part visual work, this DVD accomplishing extracts from all sequences, of which No3 being represented with the longest segment, is surely a right approach for saving time on something less abstract and more comprehensible to an average moviegoer.Stars awarded are for acrobatic and ballet performing skills of implementing the moviemaker's delusions."
4,a great barney primer,"A trailer for Cremaster 3, if you will. A great introduction for students and novices interested in learning more about Barney's work. No, you won;t be able to find the whole films for sale elsewhere, don't bother, wait for a screening to come around to a museum near you. I have sat through the entire series, and found it totally stimulating, beautiful and strange."
1,Disappointed,Was under the impression we'd be getting the 30 minute clips of the actual thing. This was just an advertisement. Don't buy it!!!
3,Multi-Angle Feature???,"Figuring out how to activate the so-called ""multi-angle feature"" on this DVD is harder than figuring out the film itself. Supposedly, one can view all five parts simultaneously with additional footage and audio that you don't get when you watch the 30 min. feature straight through. That'd be a kick, eh? Might even make it worth the cost. Write a review if you know and share the answer."
1,Matthew Barney is a jack-ass,"I saw the Cremaster Cycle, number three in particular, and i thought it was absolutly a waste of time. The order, by and far, has to be the most non sensical part of the entire sequence. The only people who enjoyed it didnt really, and are just saying so to make others feel like they are less. I understand Barney was trying to convey a deeper meaning, but he didnt, what he did do is manage to waste large amounts of money Dont buy this, Matthew Barney is nothing more than a no good psudo-artist, dont let him get his hands on any more of your money."
1,thin as tissue,"never ever once do you get that suspension of disbelief that lets you get sucked into this, nothing more than a gaint overfinanced movie set swarming with smarmy stylists and artworld insects buzzing up each others' asses. if a film needs a book to explain it, bah; it either stands on its own or it doesn't. it's a humongous narcissistic indulgence. yawn. no wonder he married that grandstanding twit Bjork, they're perfect for each other, experts at convincing droves of goldfish that they're in the presence of the real thing. pretty, vacant."
5,Confused Barney Style,"The DVD is not the complete Cremaster 3 movie. Easy for most fans to figure out but if you are just getting into Barney or saw Cremaster 3 at a special showing this is only part of it. This DVD contains a 30 minute ""Order"" movie and then it seems a longer version using multi angle feature that is very difficult to figure out. I finally had to get on the computer to play the DVD and use the controls there find the ""angles"" Great art and love the work but DVD still confusing."
4,Intriguing as well as confusing.,"I did enjoy this piece of work but I am still baffled by one element. That would be how to work the rest of the DVD. I've read many reviews, most agreeing that it's puzzling, but none have helped me find the way.I watched the 30 minute main part but I can't for the life of me figure out how to work the rest. I would greatly appreciate any help."
1,What is Barney's Problem?,"Oh for cryin' out loud, quit ditzing around and just release the five part film cycle. This piece, at best, is a special added feature on a full DVD set."
1,we get the art we deserve,"Matthew Barney's Cremaster cycle is audacious and precious little else. Apparently, that's the easy sell in today's art world, where bravado is consistently mistaken for unalloyed genius. You can't blame Mr. Barney for spotting and exploiting an opportunity, but the future will find him in the same dustbin of irrelevance that currently houses Jeff Koons, Robert Longo and Julian Schnabel."
1,horrible,"this is the most pointless film ever. The art community should read the Emperor's New Clothes i mean god what an absolutly meaningless statement, and what a waste of my time. I guess this could be made up with awesome visuals, but i didn't find them at all interesting to look at it. If anything it was amusing to think of all the sheep in the art community enjoying this and thinking they were smart or cultured for it. It had absolutly zero impact on my life."
2,Won't buy homedic product again.,This scale might be consistant but it weighs 20 pounds heavier than any other scale I have used. There is no way to adjust it since it's digital. I contacted homedic customer service and never got a reply. Will not buy from them again.
1,Homedic scale inaccuate,"My scale weighs 14 pounds lighter than my doctor's scale. There is no way to reset it. I've replaced the battery, cleaned the contacts, etc. Nothing works. It is consistent in its reading, but 14 pounds light. I checked the Internet for help but found nothing useful.I would not buy one of their products again."
2,WEIGHS VERY LOW,"This is not an accurate scale. It consistently weighs 4-5 lbs lower than on any other scale. I do not recommend this scale unless you want to ""fool"" yourself into thinking you actually weigh less than you know you do!"
1,waste of money,The milage calculations don't work and the landmarks(trails) are in the wrong location. Representive said they don't plan to do anything about it maybe until they have made all they can off this defective version.
4,Topo USA map CD's,Produces very deatailed maps great for campming and hiking. Seems to have less detail in general than USGS quads (doesn't map buildings for example). Print quality is very good and you can print multi-page maps. Downloading data to Garmin GPS unit is confusing but it works.
4,Much Larger than the Picture,"This item is full of features that are great for the $50 price tag. It appears that APC is phasing out the silver model and replacing it with an identical black version that is aroudn $100-$150. However, the picture is misleading. This unit is quite long and would not fit in my 20"" wide audio/video cabinet. Make sure you look at the measurements before you order it."
4,My kind of country,"This is quite an old REBA Mcentire cd. I was not sure what to expect as I like newer REBA albums, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised . I have to say say thouhgh not one song stands out for me as I enjoyed all of them. If you like REBA weather it be the old REBA songs or the new ones you will still like this cd."
4,"Traditional, Traditional, TRADITIONAL!!!","This album contains mostly Traditional songs for country. As I said in my ""Just A Little Love"" Review, this album is what saved Reba from getting fired from MCA. This album was produced by Harold Shedd, the last time in the 80's Reba would work with anyone other than Jimmy Bowen. It yielded 2 #1 hits, How Blue and Somebody Should Leave. Both of which are on her Greatest Hits Vol. 1. If you're not too much of a fan of traditional, buy that instead, but if you are purchase this! Before I Met You is a very good upbeat song. I also LOVED the song ""Everything But My Heart"", which was about a man wanting her for everything other than her heart (physical relationship). Those 4 are probably the best from this album, and this just allowed Reba to continue making ""Her Kind of Country"", which also put her in a co-producer spot with Jimmy Bowen from 1985-1989. This album was a great album, but even better ones were forthcoming...."
4,No School Like Old School,"A buddy of mine gave me this album on vinyl about 7 years back, and I remember hearing some of it. Recently he linked me to this page and now I want to get the CD, because this album was cool back them but now that it's re-mastered? WHOA, even better!(Thanks a million, Scott!) :)This band was obvioulsy influenced by Judas priest, as one listen to 'Day Of The Saxons' immediately reminds you of Rob Halford's screaming vocals and the great guitar work they were known for.Metal Blade had a great roundup of bands, but it seems that time, competition, and hanging styles have made most of this music obsolete by today's standards, except by those of us who STILL love it, myself included.Let the times change, but there's No school like Old school. Witchkiller rules!"
5,amazing unit,"I bought this for my girlfriend - and once I turned it on, I was absolutely astounded at the incredible sound quality this baby packs given such a small package.for the price, this player absolutely rocks and beats my Ipod's butt in many ways - particularly size, weight, and specifically audio quality! no two ways about it... if you need an mp3 player without the need for massive storage (as frankly, most people) this is the unit to get."
5,Great product!!,"I have owned this Iaudio unit for 3 months. I use it everyday in the car (broken radio). Drag and Drop file management from Windows XP. It has very good ear buds. I have tried other ear buds for sound quality on this unit and so far nothing(in the $20 or less range) reproduces better sound.The small ""plastifoam"" case is great, protects really well. I clean it out every once in while.Random or sequential playback, songs easily skipped, one button.Highly recommended. Paid approx. $120."
5,Everything you always wanted in a flash player,A very nice little player with excellent features. I highly recommend it. The only downside is the instruction manual which is crap in about 6 languages. Fortunately if you're savvy enough to be reading this you'll be able to figure out and navigate through the folder-style controls.
2,Had a problem after a week,"At first I loved the compact iAudio player, but after the first week, the earphone input (hole in the player), didn't hold the input jack securely, resulting in no sound. I could jiggle it in the hole resulting in sound for about a second, but could not get it to work continuously. Unfortunately, I threw away my receipt and box, or I would return it."
4,iaudio u2 great mp3 player,This little unit does it all.Plays all types of music files without a hitch.Downloading is a breeze and recharging from the usb port i find is great.Ear buds did not fit my ears and customer support is a joke.Other than that i would highly recommend this unit. If you have the extra cash i would recommend getting the 1 gig unit.
4,i Audio U2 512 Digital Music player,I really how compact it is and the set on the display is easy to use. The only thing I would change would be to give it up gradeable capabilities for more music.
2,Still trying to get this *&^%$ player to work,"I want to believe all of the positive reviews; I really do! But at the moment I'm still having problems with the downloading and uploading of the firmware. I know, I know: do it in recovery mode! Whatever that is! (Don't worry, I've been to the site and followed the directions 20+ times!)And as for customer support...I got a message giving hours and ""Good bye"" ( I did called during the hours CS was supposedly open). I had a MPIO and wanted something more reliable but once again find the software package and manual (so big and so little information!) are not intuitive or easy to use. Maybe the Mac Nation is right.And as for that first review posted here on Amazon.com, I hope that guy got a bonus; he must be working for Cowan!Don"
5,"In Appreciation Of Colorado, Yesterday and Today","Grant Collier's 'Colorado, Yesterday and Today' is an exceptional work in an exceptional period of time. Not often have I seen such dedication to detail. This dedication is evident in Grant Collier's testamonial to his great grand-father Joseph. What a piece of work this book is! Not only are the photographs accurately re-taken, but Grant also provides short details that accompany each section. I find this attention to detail quite refeshing. Not like other related books on the market. I am recommending this book to all of my friends. I do not wish to bore you any further with my writing. Just buy Grant Collier's book(s) and let him show you what he is capable of."
2,Photographic regression,"I purchased this book in addition to the competing Jackson/Fieldler book that my husband had requested as a gift because one or more reviews of the latter suggested that this one was better. I disagree. An odd fact is that the old pictures are much better, much sharper than the new ones. This gives a disagreeable effect. It comes across as a cheaply made book. I suppose the old photos were made with a large view camera, yielding a large glass plate negative. The new ones seem to have been made with something far inferior."
5,On the Shoulders of Our Ancestors,"I've been driven to take action. I will not remain complacent.Wow, what an eye opener.This book and author tell it like it is, no sugarcoating what hell was like, is like, but won't be like much longer for immigrants. Excuse me, not just immigrants, minorities are apart of this struggle."
1,Watch out for the Buffalo's Wife,"All in all, I was not impressed with my first Odds Bodkin encounter. I felt the stories were marred, rather than enhanced, by Mr. Bodkins' sound effects. There were many times that my child (and I) simply could not understand what was being said.Additionally, although the cover indicates the tape is suitable for children ages 6 and over, I have to say I disagree. One story on the tape, The Buffalo's Wife, has a section where the father (a human, not a buffalo) is stomped to death by a herd of buffalo. It has a fairly graphic description of bone pieces and other blood and gore, which my daughter and I both found quite disturbing.Other Bodkin tapes/titles may be better, but I'm not sure I'm willing to invest money to find out."
4,Very Good !,"""A Guide to Weather"" edited by Richard Whitaker and written by several noted science professors from around the globe. Though more expensive (in hardback) than many such books, this one is very nicely appointed as well as being well-organized, comprehensive, very informative and understandable, and just plain enjoyable. But it is also Basic, and definitely not a field reference or daily reference in any sense of those terms. It's certainly worth reading and keeping but I would look for it ""on sale"". (That might just be my cherished Scotch ancestry showing through, however.)"
4,BROOKS BOOK READER,"Having read every other book in this series i found the new trilogy to be average fair when it comes to the shannara series. As with nearly every new shannara series the only returning character is the druid. All and all a great read and I highly recomend it to any fan of the series. To quickly respond to some other feedback, this is a fantasy novel and if you read through it thinking ""that cant happen"" of course you will not enjoy it."
2,Very disappointed.,"This product will give you a reading, step off, step back on and it gives you a completely different reading. I have learned to weigh myself three times and take the average. Not impressed."
2,I do not like,is a CD with good songs but others are boring and very similar between them and it makes the cd is made long. I recommend his latest cd
3,nothing new here,"Bill Hickok is a fascinating character, but not here. And they didn't even spell his name correctly."
5,Required Reading,Everyone needs to read this book. It is for people who have experienced sexual abuse...it is for people who have not...boys who might engage in abusive behavior or boys who will hopefully learn to help stop it...and parents who need to learn that loving their children is the single most important thing they can do.Dr. Feuereisen is a master at her craft. Her book is written in direct informative language with very concrete observations and answers. This is not just a memorable and important 'how to' book'...it is a healing experience in itself. Dr Feuereisen's book is filled with compassion and hopefulness. It teaches us that we can all make a positive difference...in our own lives and in the lives of others.This book should be available in every library and bookstore so that everyone can have the opportunity to benefit from Dr. Feuereisen's wisdom. Oprah...you listening??
2,Inaccurate,"I gave this book two stars due to the courage of those abused and shared their story. The view on "" date rape"" is wrong and innapropriate. I have been abused and also spent thirty years assessing perpetrators and victims.When one approaches these tpics in a book format CAUTION needs to be used to be accurate. I agree with the other one star review. All victims please read with caution. Psychology and life trauma is not black and white, there is no one answer.Dan Williams,Psy.D., P.A.-C."
3,What do you want? It's a coupling ring.,"I was SO excited about this when I learned what I can do with it. I put my 100mm macro lens on my camera, and then connect my 50mm lens, backwards, with this coupling ring. This creates a truly insane amount of magnification! So it's great.One problem: once I put it on, it was hard to get off. Well, not really. I was able to remove it. But it took one UV filter with it. No matter what I do, I can't seem to get my 55mm UV filter off of this coupling ring. It's too thin to get any kind of leverage. So I just had to buy a new filter, and store this thing with the filter that it won't surrender.It's not the end of the world, but come on! I really, really can't get it off. Maybe I should try heating it or something. I don't know. But it did leave a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth.But the photos I am able to produce ... WOW! I guess it's worth the price of a UV filter."
5,Great scent,The scent that this product leaves on your body is phenomenal. I have also bought the tuscan blood orange perfume for my girlfriend also because she enjoys the scent which smells great also. It is a big block of soap and does the job.
2,No lather unless you use a loofah or gloves,"Pacifica Tahitian Gardenia Natural Soap 6 ou/170 grams.Scent is nice, but somehow smells artificial to my nose. Along with the fact that it won't lather, I get annoyed using it.The soap block is heavy and too big even for my extra long hands. The squared corners do not help grasp. It is very slippery, so with the unusually large block size, it constantly slips off my soapdish.I understand that you don't always need lather to get clean, but! unless you put on some sort of loofah type glove, it not only just doesn't lather, it does not clean your skin. Even when I rub and rub with loofah (or gloves that help remove dead skin) to work up a lather, I don't feel as clean as I do with other soaps labeled natural or not."
2,Only good for the first two months,"After about 5 or 6 weeks the shower portion could not stay in the top. The fabric thats on the sling frame started wearing away after abou 10 uses. The shower was difficult to use and broke within the first two months. My son who is in the 25% range outgrew it and would hit his head on the top of the tub at 2 months. I purchased the primo eurospa, after purchasing this product and I love it. Its large enough were my son now at 7 month has plenty of room to play."
1,"Poor quality, inconvenient","This is an awkward, poor-quality product. The ""shower"" attachment is hard to hold, and difficult to press the button to use; it quit working after two uses, and it is much easier to us a cup for rinsing. The sling is hard to put back on the frame once you take it off for washing. The feature for hanging the unit is virtually useless, as there is no convenient way to hang it based on the design of the item. I also found that the built-in temperature sensor is unreliable, and I would definitely advise against using it to check the temperature of the water for safety purposes. Honestly, your best bet is a contoured foam bath pad and a cup for rinsing."
2,Not all that great,"I've had a few problems with this toddler tub. I received it as a baby shower gift....looked great...but within a month of using it, the spray nozzle completely broken down. There were no kinks in the hose, no problems that I could see at all.......it just wouldn't work!!!"
1,Extremely disappointing,"I returned a different tub that I got at my shower and bought this because it had the shower feature. Not only does the shower break after about 3 months, but now the covering on the sling feature is ripping along the edges. The shower button has always been difficult to press down using just one hand. The batteries constantly needed to be replaced and about a month ago (we have had it for only 5 months now)it just plain died. Now it just sits in the bathroom taking up space. It's a shame...my son really enjoyed being sprayed with it!"
1,Very Disappointed,This tub was given to me as a gift. I thought it would be a good tub to have because of the shower unit. I was wrong. When I opened it up and started using it I quickly learned that the shower does not work. The button is hard to press and the water does not come out very good. The sling sits too low during the infant stage. When I sat it up higher my daughter slides down and her legs become too long for her to sit comfortably. I just had to stop using the shower unit altogether. It was too much trouble just to give the baby a simple bath. Now instead of the shower unit I use a cup to rinse her off. The instructions say that if the shower unit stops working then you have to place the sprayer below the unit and it will start back working. This in fact was not the case. The unit never did start back working. Now I just use the tup without the shower. I am glad that I did not put any money into it and I wish I had read the review on this tub before placing it on my registry.
1,Not very impressed at all,"When I saw the item, I thought this was a great product, but when I tried to use it, it was a whole other story. The baby slides right down the sling and his legs get all scrunched up. Because of the packaging the tubing for the shower was all kinked and therefore the shower never really worked well, I had to stretch the tubing allt he way out and it never sprayed really well. I agree with other reviews that say that the button is difficult to depress, I needed 2 hands to operate it, which made it useless, because how am I supposed to bathe my baby at that point.I would recommend looking for another bath, mine is going to the garbage, or going to be used as a litter box. I should have read all these review ahead of time."
1,Shower is Junk!,"This product was a great concept, but it needs to be redone! The shower feature is uncomfortable to use, it is very awkward to hold the button down. That is the least of this products problems, it stops working after two uses! If the battery pack gets wet, it is done, you cannot save it, even after drying it out. It seems that a bath product which would contain water should be somehow waterproofed! I would have been much happier just getting the 4-in-1 bath station."
1,Too bad..we Liked the Tub...,"I was so excited to give my daughter a bath in her shower tub..and she loved it! Unfortunately...the shower only worked two times before we discovered battery acid in the shower unit! the battery compartment didn't seal properly and the moisture got inside..we dried it properly and everything...it was really too bad because she loved getting sprayed by the shower and this was the only tub we found that had the little shower attachment...also- at 5 weeks, she was too long to be in the tub w/ the shower unit in it...the sling tore although she only weighs 9lbs and I don't think the temperature guage on the shower unit was ever right...new mom's BEWARE! this is not worth the money"
2,Total Bust!,"I got this as a shower gift and although the shower thing worked the first couple of times, it quickly stopped working! We put in new batteries and my husband tried to fix the springs inside but nothing worked. When it did work it was great but it broke WAY too quickly and we didn't even do anything to it. Also the sling was way too slanted and my baby kept sliding down it and it got cold fast if it was once wet and then dried."
1,Avoid this item,"I loved the sling, but the shower worked all of once, barely, and then died. The troubleshooting didn't work and the company won't send a replacement. You're better off just using the sprayer on the kitchen sink."
1,I agree with everyone else-This tub is the worst,"Like everyone else, I wanted this tub for the shower feature. I registered for it and received it at my baby shower. It worked for a few weeks, but then the shower just stopped working. Also, my son hated the sling. There is absolutely no feeling of stability for him, it sinks right down when we put him on it. We had to get one of those foam teddy bears to put over the sling before he would stop screaming when we put him in the tub. I contacted customer service and they sent me another shower, but it took nearly three weeks. Thank goodness we saved the box and were able to return it, even if it was just for store credit. The lady at the return counter said that these are returned all the time. If you want to try it, just make sure you save the box for your return (and you will be returning it, I'm 99% sure of that!)"
1,Do not buy!!,"I would not recommend this tub and shower to anyone. I was given it as a gift. The does not always work, and the space designed to keep the unit in takes up too much space in the tub. I had to buy a foam pad for my daughter in order to keep her from sliding around! Now that she can sit up the tub is useless to me. There is no support at this point. My daughter is very long and there is not enough room in this tub!"
2,Good concept - bad product,"I wish I had read the reviews before I wasted my time and bought this product. Really good ideas with the shower, but my 3 month old son just hates it - and he loves his bath time. Everything worked just fine, but there is no room in it and I really don't like how he kept falling into the bottom where the shower is. The ""mouse"" sprayer is weak and hard to handle. Just not a good product."
1,if it worked it would have been great,"I have had two. Was just hoping something was wrong with the 1st one, but as it turns out there was something wrong with the design. I wished it would have work right. We really needed a good size tub her are 1yr old. we only have a hot tub type bath tub and it will be a long time before she is ready for that. THe shower worked on the 1st on for about a week and on the 2nd one only one time."
1,Agreed not worth $,"I agree with all the above posts. The shower button feature was really hard to press and use, even for my husband our fingers would be sore by the end of giving a bath. Our daughter loved it but in the end of its use (which wasnt for very long) it died on us and now we cant even use it for our next baby. I am a big advocate of Summer Infant products almost everything I have is from them and good quality, but as for this tub, look elsewhere."
4,bath center,Bought this as a gift...didn't really open the box...just wrapped it...Person I bought it for was happy...so I guess it was fine...never heard to the contrary.
2,just ok,"The tub is fine and I like the sling, but my shower hose is constantly kinking and just drizzles water."
1,not so good,i work on a toys r us store and i recive this bath tub for a refund a lot. Once i try a new one in the store and the shower didn't work. My sister in law recive one for her baby girl and worked for only a week!!. Really this one in not so good at all.
2,Difficult to use,"It is a good idea in theory, but in practice... You need two people to use it. My baby doesn't fit in it, he slides down the sling. The button to operate the shower is in a difficult place. And the way my baby likes to move around... It made bath time a chore. The best thing and his favorite thing is to take a shower with baby or take a bath with baby. It's a great bonding time and my baby loves baths. With one hand supporting his head he likes to float and splash. He giggles the entire way through."
3,I Guess,"I really don't know about this tub..I mean the actual ""tub"" is ok,but the shower unit is the problem.You have to unscrew so many batteries and I just can't get it to work! I received it as a baby shower gift so....overall I mean I do love the ""tub"" i just want the spray to work....well, i guess I can wait awhile because my daughter is only 4 1/2 weeks."
3,It broke right away,"I love the idea of it but the shower part broke right from the beginning. If there is any kink in the hose the water doesn't come out, and there was always a kink."
2,Not Sure,"So far this isn't useful to me. I went out and bought a sponge thing for my son to sit on. He is 2 1/2 months old right now and when we first used it he didn't like it because he wasn't in the water. You fill the tub up and they still sit out of the water. Also, do not let the hose hang down when getting the water prepared because you will come back to it and find a big wet puddle on your floor. For some reason it leaks out of the spary part. But so far this hasn't been useful but the bath does seem like a good idea. So we will see how it works for us in the future."
1,Junk!!!,"Very disappointed with this product!! I would have returned it if I hadn't discarded package.Why is it a junk?1. Shower head is a joke. Using 4 AA battery, very awkward to change battery. The worst thing, it worked only once, dead on second time.2. Sling failed to support my 2-week only baby. Bad quality!!You might as well stay away from other Summer Infant product."
1,Sprayer worked for 5 MINUTES,"I got this tub as a gift from my registry and have since bought 2 more for pregnant friends who also registered for it. I've used it on my 2 month old, but never with the shower. Yesterday, I finally tried it and it sprayed very nicely-- for about 5 minutes. Then it stopped... It also leaked all over the table. I could not believe it, but I guess everyone can't be wrong. What a shame.Also, the baby's ears will get wet if more than 1"" of water is used, but this amount of water is suggested several times on the packaging."
1,very disappointed,"I registered for this item and received it as a gift, and I feel badly for my friend's waste of money...The shower never worked well as the tube was kinked in the box and I couldn't straighten it out. Holding the shower head and trying to push the button was also very difficult. I never felt comfortable with the sling and ended up just supporting my baby in my arm. I do use the tub itself, and it is ok. There have to be better choices out there!"
1,Not a good product,"I loved this product when I first saw it in the store. But when I got the shower part didn't work as will as I axpected it to. Also after putting batteries in the shower part I notice that water leaks inside of it, which I think is a manfacturare's error. I think anyone is just better off buying a tub set by itself which will save more money that way."
2,not useful,"I'm a new mom and when I registered for this tub I thought it would be good thinking that it would grow with my son. Well I was wrong. The only part of the tub that I have used was the sling and I found it easier to just put it in my regular bathtub. The baby bath is bulky and doesn't have much room in it.Plus my son loves to move around lot and he would splash water out of the tub and make a bigger mess. The sling was good for a while but now that he wants to be sitting up its useless because he slides. The shower partdoesn't hold that much water and for babies who like to have water put on them, its a pain to try to refill it all the time. The old fashion cup of water is just as good."
1,~PIECE OF CRAP~,"OK, so I read all the reviews like so many other new moms to be. And despite the bad reviews I had read on this tub I desided to put it on my baby registry anyway. I figured ""hey, the other moms probably just did something to make the sprayer mess up"". BIG MISTAKE. We had our baby October 19th, 2004. WHen I finally got to use the tub she LOVED it! She liked the water spraying all over her. It was like her own little shower............the TWO times the SPRAYER worked. It just will not work at all anymore. I am highly disapointed with this product. AND of course when I called Summerlin to complain and/or see if I could do something to fix it ALL I recieved was a message machine; then NO-ONE returned my calls. SO moms to be, I would not spend the extra money on this spray tub. Especially if your buying it for the shower!"
1,Dont waste your money!,"As previously stated, great concept - bad quality. I, too was so excited to use this for my 6 month old. What a waste. The shower head has very little pressure and takes forever to rinse a tiny head of hair. I dont know how they could state a two year old toddler will fit in the tub, as my 20 month old would laugh at me. The support mesh i guess would be good for an infant, but once they grow to the awkward size (before sitting on their own)there is no way they would be comfy in this tub.I am on my way to return this and buy the blow up tub that lasted so long and was great for my daughter. (and almost half the price!)What a waste...."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TUB!,"I got this tub thinking it would be great for all the infant to toddler stages for my daughter. BOY WAS I WRONG! It was difficult to install the batteries, she was not at all comfortable using it as an infant (I took it back long before she could use it as a toddler. Thanks Toys R Us!). When using the sling, if her feet were not scrunched up, her head was falling through the slant made when the sling is attached to the tub. The sprayer had to be held in too precise of a postion to work, which was rare. PLEASE DO NOT GET THIS TUB.! I now use the Sassy tub that has a turtle on it. My daughter loves bath time in this tub!"
1,preemie mommy,"I registered for this tub for my premature baby. He is very small and floppy, so I figured that the sling would help me hold him with one hand and I could rinse him with the other. Well, the theory was great if the shower actually worked. The first tub we got, the shower didn't operate at all. It just made a loud noise. I returned it for a new one and that worked for about 4 baths and then stopped, just made the same noise.The other issue is the sling isn't very supportive. It doesn't hold the baby's head or neck up very well. It also allows the baby to slide down toward the bottom of the bath so you have to move them back up at least 3 or 4 times during the bath.Considering that this is the most expensive bath I expected a little better quality.I found that the 3.99 bear sponge that you just put in the kitchen sink works much better!The only good thing is that so far Babies R Us has been great about taking this back."
1,crap,This product was terrible. The spray never worked and my son slide down the mesh slide htat came with it. I got ride of after 1 month. I do not recommend it. It is a waster of money or gift.
3,It's a Great Concept...but,When I saw this in the store I just had to add it to my baby register. When I received it I was excited to put it to work. The first time I used it the shower part worked great. The next time all the shower did was make noise with no water spraying out. I agree with the one review that said the shower makes a lot of loud noise. But I thought it would still be great since my first child loves taking showers. My son loves showers too but because the shower part on the unit no longer works I know just take him in the shower with me. I am quite upset that the shower unit stop working so fast.
2,Find another baby tub because the Shower is useless,"I bought this tub because i liked the idea of the shower part and roominess of this tub but unfortunately the shower part is useless, i broke within a couple uses and when it did work it was just not worth the extra money. My suggestion is to buy the tub that looks like this with out the shower part.Good Luck!"
2,Shower is worthless and tub is not big enough,"I bought this tub because of the shower feature. The shower is more like a tiny trickle that makes it difficult to rinse soap quickly. Also, I have a long baby who had to fold himself up like a pretzle to fit in the tub when the shower is in place. I took the shower feature out to make more room and use a cup to rinse him off.My little guy is now 4 months old and is way too big to have a bath in this tub. I thought it was a great idea, but I have not been that pleased."
1,Don't Buy This!,I bought this tub because my husband liked the shower feature. It worked about 3 times then quit working. My daugther was also very uncomfortable in the tub and cried her head off. I ended up buying the sure comfort tub that is half the price and it works perfect. I just use a tupperware cup and it works way better than the shower. She now enjoys her bath. I ended up selling this tub at a garage sale for a couple of bucks. I would not buy it again and would not recommend it at all.
2,Not worth it,"This tub seemed like it would be great, but like everyone else had wrote, the shower part broke just a few times after using it. If you have a sprayer at your kitchen sink, then there is no reason to waste your money on this tub. The Sure Comfort Deluxe Newborn-to-Toddler Tub is just as comfortable and easy to bathe baby in, and almost half the money. I had registered for this product without reading reviews first, and luckily was able to exchange it at Babies R Us for credit towards another. The sling is a comfortable angle to wash your baby in, but that is the only positive comment I have regarding this product."
2,Soo not worth it,This shower is not worth the money. My first time using it and the shower part never worked. The tub part is good but there's no use buying it just for the tub part.
2,moving on,"I received this tub before my baby was born. Initially, the sling worked well in the tub and the shower allowed me to bathe my son on the bathroom counter. After using the shower twice, it completely died. My son outgrew the tub quickly once he learned how to push his body up with his legs. The sling, however, I still use in the big tub. You have to watch really closely, as it's easy for him to wiggle his way to the bottom of it. I'm looking for other tubs now, and wouldn't recommend this one."
1,Save your $$,"When I registered for my shower, I saw this tub and thought it was a must have. They were out of stock when people were shopping for my shower so I ended up buying this myself with gift cards I had received. When I finally got to use it, I was disappointed to find that the shower attachment did not work. I contacted the manufacturer and they sent me out a new shower unit. This time, out of the blue it stopped working. Im not at all happy with the tub size, for such a big bulky tub, there is hardly any room for a 5 month old baby who only weighs 12 lbs. The sling has two positions, while my son likes to sit up, I think when you put it in the upright position, it causes the baby to slide down the mesh sling. Overall I am not happy with this tub. In fact after typing this out, I think Im going to call the manufacturer back again and gripe about how awful this tub is."
1,You gotta be kidding me...,"I knew this was a mistake but it ended up on our regisrty anyway. First of all, the hose between the pump and shower head is flimsy and wrinkled - not even remotely round as shown in the nice picture on the box. Pretty obvious that a kinked hose doesn't work very well.Next problem - the electrical switch is in the shower head and the contacts back at the pump end are unreliable - hence the other reviews that said that it doesn't even work. A couple of whacks gets it going - a highly specialized troubleshooting technique ;)Next problem - they made an attempt to put a rubber seal around the battery compartment, which would have worked fine if it was built properly - like out of a block of aluminum. But a crappy seal is a crappy seal and batteries and water don't mix.And the last problem is that the flow is ridiculously slow! Come on, a dixie cup to dip water is good enough for my kid - and yours. Buy the $16 tub."
2,Not the Best,"I read the reviews about this tub but decided to buy it anyway. The tub is O.K., but it is definitely overpriced.Pros:The shower feature is helpful because it allows you to use fresh water to rinse the babyThe sling seems to be comfortable for my daughterThe handy hook allows me to hang it out of the wayCons:The tub is already too small for my 5-week old daughterThe shower feature had to be removed to provide space (so the very reason I decided to purchase the tub can no longer be used!)The tub is expensiveThe concept of the shower is great. I hope the product can be improved upon in the future."
2,A Mislead Parent,I was under the impression that this tub had a working tub sprayer. I ended up returning 2 of them until finally getting one to work for only a couple of months. I figured I would suck it up and just use the cool net that holds my daughter up out of the water for at least 6 months or so until buying a new tub. Let me say that she has already outgrown this tub which should have lasted her through her toddler years. Oh and she's in the 25% for her age so you can't blame it on her size. The only reason I rated this product 2 stars was because it's little net did work and at least the product held water. If you still have the box take it back and go with the eurobath by primo. That's what I'm about to buy and I must say that is a TUB.
2,Not all its cracked up to be....,"I have a four month old who bathed in the bathroom sink until recently. First day I tried using this tub I noticed slight assembly was required so I tucked it away until I purchased batteries and had some spare time to put it together. When I finally got around to using it, I was unsatisfied. There wasnt enough leg room when you use the sling and without the sling if your baby cant sit up on his own its impossible to use. My son kept sliding down and I wasnt able to have both hands free to wash him. I found the tub over all uncomfortable for me and the baby didnt look like he was very comfortable in it either (and he loves taking baths). The shower thing worked fine (the two occasions I used it)but it was awkward to use so I dont use it anymore. (this was the whole reason I chose the tub in the first place). No matter what position you put the sling in it just wasnt working out for me. I plan on returning it for a traditional tub."
1,I was disappointed,"Although the idea is great, the shower feature only worked a few times before breaking. Even before it stopped working I found it difficult to hold with wet hands. Either I got a dud or this item was not tested well before being put on the market."
3,"Good tub, bad shower","The tub itself is very nice--a good size with nice features like grippers and contoured parts. The shower, however, stopped working after only 4 baths and was only a small stream of water when it did work. We still use the reservoir portion to have some clean rinsing water handy, but the sprayer is useless. If you purchase this product for the tub itself, you will be pleased."
2,Disappointed with shower,"I registered for this tub when my 10 month old was born because I thought the shower feature would be very handy. Unfortunately, it only worked twice. The spray was soo light that by the time I finally got all of the soap rinsed off, she was screaming taht she was ready to get out. As she got a little taller, around 4 months, there wasn't room for the shower attachment AND her legs. The sling was very helpful (the only reason this tub got 2 stars)when she wasn't able to sit up, but even then, she wasn't immersed in the water much. She got cold very quickly. Also, like other reviewers stated, the sling doesn't fit in my sink like they suggest. If I had it to do over again, I would purchase a tub with a built in seat. This tub's blue circle looks like it would prevent slipping, but it isn't all that effective."
2,Shower Sucks!!!!!,"I bought this thinking that this would be just wonderful for the new baby, well I was wrong! I followed the directions and the shower head started like it was suppose to and I THOUGHT it was great...Then I put my son in the tub and I started to use the shower and it quit!!! If you are a parent you know how frustrating it is to have a newborn laying there screaming because they are cold...I had to hurry up and fill the rest of the tub with water....because it said in the directions that all you have to fill is the resivour.....I give it 2 stars because I like the thing that the baby lays on and the tub is quite large. I recommend buying a different tub for your baby."
1,it was just junk,"the whole thing stinks, period. Tub it cumbersome, shower does not work. will not fit over double sink, do not waste your money"
1,Appears to be convenient but really isn't.,"I was so excited when I bought this bath tub, because I thought ""wow! what a neat idea, my little baby can have a shower!"" I also thought of the convenience it would be to be able to easily rinse off the suds from my son's head and body. It worked perfectly for about a week or two and then the shower button would get stuck and wouldn't stop spraying. It just showed how cheaply made this thing was. I love the tub part, but I didn't buy this for the neat tub, I bought it for the shower thing...and that is just a waste of money. So I threw away the shower thing and kept the tub. So if you're like me and think it's a great idea to have a shower thingy...don't waste your money on this, just buy a regular tub because that's what you'll end up with anyway."
2,Awful!,The shower on this tub broke by the time my son was turned three months. I was very disappointed since the shower was the reason we wanted it. Don't waste your money on this product!
4,"Not bad, not good","I agree with most people who bought this product. I used the shower once, and it never worked again. I emailed the company and they sent a replacement shower portion almost immediately. I put new batteries in the new unit, and it worked wonderfully for about a week. I put the shower unit aside because it was taking too long to get the shampoo out of the baby's hair. About a week later, I went to use the shower portion again, and the connections where the batteries are had rusted.I know I could email the company again and get another replacement shower portion, but I have stopped using the shower part of the tub. My baby is now 9 months old and she is still using the tub portion and the clean water portion of this product. Overall, the shower part could have been designed better, but the company WILL send out a new one. Just email them."
4,I like this tub,"I have never attached the spray but I don't think you need it. I love the sling back that fits inside the tub. I lay my son in it and the water comes up to his chest. He loves the bath. The sling is rounded on both sides so I feel he is safe and will not roll off. As for the shower spray, a wash cloth has the same effect. I would buy this again."
1,Get another tub,"Get a bath seat instead for infants. It looks like a good idea, but it isn't. The water spray never worked. Once the baby is too big to being laying down on the matt they provide you. There is no way to have him sit up without you holding him, which the baby is to slippery. When that happens get a safety first bath seat that clamps on the side of the tub. It's so much better."
2,Does not make Bathtime fun,We thought this tub was going to be great since it had the shower and the sling but both of those items turned out to be a problem. The shower takes up way too much room which leaves no place for the babies legs. The sling does not fit in a double sink so you have to bathe the newborn in the plastic bath with the sling which leaves them fully exposed and drafty. My baby hated it and would scream! We went and bought a new bath last night after only using ours three times. SAVE yourself the money and choose something different now.
2,"Great concept, poor design",I liked the fact that this tub has a shower and that it grows with our baby. I also liked the sling that comes with it. I placed the tub on top of our dining room table to make it easier on my back. The thing I don't like about it is that it is difficult to operat the shower. It's awkward to press the button on the shower head. Also the shower unit is place inside the tub which takes up space for my baby's legs.
3,Its okay...,"Yet another product my husband and I registered for, and were fortunate enough to receive at our shower.However, I am silghtly disappointed. At first, it was fine, my son was tiny when he was born, (6lbs11oz, 19.5in) and he fit in there just fine... now that hes 5 months old, and 16lbs, not so much! Using the shower is just out of the question... I have yet to use it... there would be absolutely NO room in there for him AND the shower!! It will be great when he can sit up on his own... but for now, while I have to use the sling in the tub, theres just no room!!! If only it were a little bigger!!!Also... mine had a piece of plastic sticking up on the bottom of the tub that Im glad that I noticed before my lil guy got scratched on it!"
3,"Good tub which grew with my son, but shower was useless","I had this tub for quite a while and my son got plenty of good bathtime out of it, but the shower was completely useless. It never worked! I maybe got a little trickle out of it the first time I used it--then I ended up just using the bucket to fill the tub and pour for rinsing. My son also kept slipping down the infant sling and squishing onto the area where the bucket fits into. I'd recommend this tub only to parents who have an infant who can sit up."
2,overpriced junk,"The tub is generally ok but the plug fell apart after a few uses. the shower was a disappointment. The button is on the back of the spray portion and it is hard to grip and press at the same time. Also the motor died after several uses, not the batteries, which are difficult to replace, but the motor. We bought a $5 inflatable duck and put it in our tub and used our shower head with an extra long hose. much better!"
3,Good while it lasted,"This product is nice for a few months, but the shower head stopped working on us one day. Once our daughter got a little bigger, we ended up taking the shower part out of the tub so she could straighten her legs. The sling part is nice, but we had trouble with her slipping down and were constantly repositioning her. We finally took everything out of the tub once she could sit up and it worked great (until the shower head broke) and the non slip foam circle was big enough to sit her on so she couldnt slide all over the place."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this tub for two specific reasons: I liked the idea of the shower sprayer for easy washing and I liked that it could grow with my child. Both of those are a moot point now. The shower sprayer was difficult to hold, and didn't hold enough water for my newborn's bath. I stopped using it after the 2nd time. As far as the actual tub goes, my 4-month-old ran out of leg room a month ago. He slides down on the sling now, and it doesn't have a built-in bath ring like some of the other baths, nor does it have enough width to be able to fit a bath ring into it. My son is ready to sit-up, but not unassisted. Overall, I might give this one to Goodwill and buy something else."
1,the worst!,"the shower is extremely weak and the water flow is so slow that i stopped using it few minutes after the first time i tried this product. the tub is small to begin with and having the shower pump/spray inside the tub all the more makes it small. my 2.5 month-old's legs ended up either banging the shower contraption or simply hanging out of the tub! worst tub ever, not worth it... i bought the Eurobath instead (by Primo) which, on the contrary, is the best tub ever!"
2,"Great For Toddler Tub, That Is It","I must say the shower feature on this unit is what attracted me to the purchase, however my daughter is 14 months old and the shower never worked. My husband and I followed the directions and only once did we get it to ""successfully"" spray, but this was after a frustrating bath attempt and an infant who just didn't want to sit through our experimenting, but never did it work again. The bath sling was also a disaster. The shape of the sling and hieght positions just never fit my daughter, who was not a small baby, at any stage and was completely useless for sink baths since it was just too long to fit. However, now that she is older the tub itself works perfectly for her baths, just enough room to play without wasting too much water, but I would never recommend this product based on its initial marketing ploys. There are much more inexpensive ways to bath a toddler that do not include 2 out of 3 of the function on the tub not ever working properly."
2,Sling is the only good thing about this tub,"We registered for this tub thinking it would be good because of the shower. This tub is useless and it leaks all over the kitchen counter. The shower worked only when I was testing it, then it stopped. My wife loves the sling, but that is the only thing good about this tub. If you need a tub, this is NOT the one to buy. I wish we never registered for it."
2,Love-hate this tub,"This tub is a great idea and my baby (10 weeks) loved the shower feature as soon as we started to use it. That was the disappointment, since like the other reviewers, it stopped working after one month. I called the manufacturer and they sent me a second one right away, no questions asked. That one stopped working after one use. I like the tub and the sling, but the sling is already starting to show wear at the bends after two months of use. It is really ashame that this is so poorly manufactured, because it would be really nice if it worked."
1,Shower Sprayer HORRIBLE!,"Because the button is directly on the sprayer, it is cumbersome to handle, especially when you are washing a newborn infant and need to be able to use both hands quickly(they should have thought of a handle with a squeeze trigger or something). The battery compartment has 5 screws to loosen and they don't tighten back correctly- far too many with a newborn, you just don't have the time to spend doing this- and I used a drill-driver. I have had to change the batteries three times and I have had it only three months!My advice is to buy it for the tub and great accessories for the baby to grow in to using and don't get excited about the shower spray part."
2,"Great Concept, Poor Execution","Like everybody else who's tried this tub and shower, we were impressed with the design and excited to use the system for our baby's first bath. The good news is that everything worked perfectly...the tub and sling were just right for our 8 pound newborn, and the shower sprayed a warm, light stream that made washing her hair fun. Then came the second bath, when the sprayer stopped working. After 10 minutes or so of messing around with the sprayer, following the manufacturer's instructions, we gave up. The sprayer had stopped working, and though it made some impressive noises, showed no signs of getting better. So back to Babies R Us it went, and instead we bought the Primo Eurobath...no bells or whistles,and expensive for a plastic tub, but at least it always works!"
3,A tub is a tub,"I received this tub as a shower gift and I have no complaints about it. My son loves to take a bath and is content as long as he is in the water. I didn't use the sling for long because he is too long for it and his feet would be ouside the tub - which defeats the purpose of bath time because he loves to kick his feet and splash the water around. I just hold him sitting up in the tub and let him play. I also have never used the shower part (just because I keep forgetting to buy the batteries needed for it). Again, I have no complaints because a tub is a tub and I don't see where any tub can be more spectacular than another."
2,Shower is disappointing,"I agree with the other reviewers that the kinks in the tubing and the oddly placed button make the shower difficult to use. The stream was very stop and go because of this. After about four months of use, the shower stopped working altogether. We replaced the batteries, thinking this was the problem, but it still didn't work. The sling is nice and I like the handle to hang the tub from, but I would guess there are better options out there."
2,Sling fabric smells and tub is slippery,"Even when the sling fabric is far up outside of the water, it absorbs water up to the top of the sling during the bath, like a sponge, and so my baby's hair gets wet even when I didn't intend to wash her hair. And then the sling fabric seems to have a smell when it dries - not quite a mildowy smell but something perhaps in that family. I took the sling out when my daughter was 5 months old because even though she needed it and it still fit with her on it, she kept sliding down the material. The material is not nubby enough to prevent sliding. But when I started putting her in the bathtub without the sling, the bathtub is so slippery and her butt kept sliding every which way and I spent most of my time trying to keep her from sliding onto her back. Maybe it will work better when I buy a bathtub-type non-slip pad. By the way, I never used the shower spray. The pressure was too low and it was easy enough to rinse the baby without it. It just took up space."
4,It's just ok - shower doesn't work as well as I'd hoped.,"I like this tub, but the shower is just so-so. The tub is really nice with the pad on the bottom, but my baby is 3 months old and with the sling, it's just too short.The shower part is just a waste because it doesn't work and when it does, there's no pressure.And like someone else said, the sling doesn't fit in my sink, so that's a con as well.I think there are tubs that are just as good that don't cost so much and that's a better value in my opinion."
3,"works good, but awkward","The spray is a good speed, not too light, not too fast. The tub isn't long enough for the baby to sit in the sling in it. The handle for the shower is a weird shape, doesn't fit in your hand well, and the button is on top of it. The sling on mine doesn't fit the metal frame either, too short to press the velcro together. Other than that, there are no competitors, so that makes it a good choice. Features a drain plug and a handle that twists to hang dry, which are both handy."
3,"It's OK, If you just use the tub","I was looking forward to using this product because of the shower attachment. But it doesn't work very well. The tube for the shower attachment does not work very well. It is bent (from inside the box), so the water does not spray. It is too much work to straighten it while squeezing button and bathing your baby. In the end I just use the tub like my mother used to do, and my son is fine with that."
2,Worked out for awhile,"I loved this tub to start with. It made bathing my daughter very easy when she was 3weeks old through 3months. However after that she was just getting to long for the tub. I thought the shower spray was a really good idea, until I used it for the first time, the noise was loud and scared my daughter to the point that the next time I went to give her a bath she wanted nothing to do with the tub. I found that the hanger that is on the tub is made so that instead of the tub hanging sideways on the shower curtain ring it hung facing forward, taking up a lot of room. I was hoping to store the tub there since we lived in a small apartment but that didn't work out because of the direction that it hung.But like I said before the tub and sling worked out great until my daughter was about three months old and even by two months she had no leg room."
1,tub too small,"The tub was fine when my daughter was 5lbs, but by the time she was three months old she was too big for this tub. The shower never really worked, I only used it three times because it never wanted to keep spraying."
2,Samantha's mommy,"I too bought this tub because of the shower feature. I don't recomend anyone buy it for the shower solely. The shower is very weak and doesnt spray enough water to completely rinse soap off. My baby girl is now 5 months old and no longer fits in it comfortably (she's 26 inches). The sling is another problem with the tub, The baby tends to constantly slide down. Although I will say that without the sling my baby would've outgrown the tub a long time ago. The tub also has some ditch type indentations on the floor of the tub which tend to acumulate water and cause the rapid onset of mildew. (Guess that could be avoided by drying the tub w/ a towel after using it). In the future I would look for size in a tub apart from all these other fancy features."
3,Not great for young infants,"We recieved this (and two other tubs) for our shower, and decided to keep this one because of the shower feature. I have never had any problems with the shower not working, and the stream is fine for me. I do have a slight problem with how you have to hold the shower head and push the button rather firmly. The fingers you wrap around get in the way of the stream. I first realized that the sling does not fit in my kitchen sink, and I was disappointed with that until I bathed by son with the sling in the little tub. He was too long and kept pushing himself up and down on the abrasive sling and developed a painful rash on his bottom. I have never used the sling again. When my son is old enough to sit by himself, I will use this more because he likes the stream from the shower, and I prefer to rinse him with the clean water."
3,it's good but only if you have bathroom space,"I was particularly drawn with the shower feature because I thought it would be fun to use. I knew the tub size was pretty big for our small bathroom but I thought, it would serve us a good purpose anyway. And it did. It did live up to the ""newborn-infant-toddler transition"" that it featured BUT sadly, the shower contraption was a joke. I even went out to get new batteries but it just didn't shower as I expected. So, I completely dumped it out and bathe my baby the traditional, manual way- pouring water out of a cup. Without the shower contraption, the tub is just another tub and I wished I had gotten a smaller and simpler tub. But, I think the best feature for this one that I haven't quite found with other infant tubs is the fact that you can hang it (on towel bars, for example) after use by using it's swiveling handle."
1,Terrible tub!!!,The tub is too small especially when you put the shower unit in it. The shower has no pressure and is awkward to use. The button that must be depressed to make the shower work doesn't depress easily and is difficult to keep down. All in all I was very disappointed and am planning on taking it back after using it only one time.
1,Shower feature disappointing,"We had problems with the shower too, and that was my main reason for purchase. The water pressure is weak, it's awkward to use, and the motor sound is so horrible my son cried everytime I attempted to use it... now the thing just doesn't work, and I don't think we even got to use it 10 times..."
1,Was very disappointed.,"I registered for this tub and was pretty excited to get it with the shower attachment and all. I started using the sling first, which is the only useful part of the tub. When I tried to use the sprayer for the first time, the tubing was creased from being new in the box and the water spray was not powerful enough to push the water through (kind of like a crimped water hose). So my sprayer NEVER worked. The tub was OK, but my son slipped around on the non-skid stuff too. My suggestion is to just by a sling and install a removable shower head to use as a sprayer. I took the whole thing back and did that!"
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I read all the reviews that had been posted. Most are bad reviews about this product but I bought it just to see for myself. The tub is very small and the hand held shower DOES NOT work. I had to return it it does not work. DO NOT buy this tub waste of money. Please read all the reviews, other people say the same thing."
2,Not Thrilled,"As my son grows, I keep thinking this tub will work better for him, but it hasn't. I was skeptical of the bad reviews and bought this anyway. I should have taken people's advice.1. The shower only worked one time. We keep trying to get it working based on other people's advice, but no luck.2. With the sling, the baby slides down to the bottom, but there is no place for his legs, with or without the shower in the tub. It is a strange design.3. Now he is old enough to sit up, but he tends to slide around a lot.I call this the nightmare tub. Before he was able to sit up, we bought an infant tub and used it. Now I am looking for a tub appropriate for a 6 month old."
1,THE SHOWER SPRAY DOES NOT WORK,"My husband and I chose this product because of the shower feature. Unfortunately, the shower spray broke after using it 3 times! A friend of mine told me she had similar problems with the tub. Not to mention that using the shower spray is very difficult because of the placement of the button. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"I would not recommend this tub to anyone! I was very excited to receive this tub at my baby shower, however, it was such a let down! The shower sprayer only worked properly for two baths, even then the water pressure was not great. Afterwards, the motor continued to run even when the button was not being pressed. I quit using the shower part and was still disappointed with the drain. My daughter would kick her feet in the tub and unplug the drain several times during a bath which made a wet mess of our bathroom. I guess it would be okay if you used it in the regular tub. I wound up buying a different tub after just 5 weeks of trying to use it. I would not recommend this to anyone!"
1,Not a good buy.,"This tub is dumb. The sprayer is slow, the tub is too short, and the sling is too big for my sink. The kitchen sink is better!"
1,Completely Useless Tub,"I thought ""how cool - a shower for the baby, easy rinsing!"" So WRONG. The way the shower is packed, there are at least 3 kinks in the hose, so the water stream is never at it's best. Water stream is very light anyways, so whats the point. I agree with another reviewer, the button is in the wrong place and is very difficult to manuever. Tub is way too small for bigger babies - mine was 8 lbs, 21"" coming home and we had to prop it up to the highest level and remove the shower part for her to fit. She slides down the sling so I'm constantly trying to hold on to her while bathing her, and getting to her back without her sliding into the edge is impossible. In short, don't bother!"
2,"Good idea, bad design",The whole idea of a baby tub with a shower is an excellent idea...but I think they need to redesign the shower handle. It is almost impossible to hold the sprayer comfortably without blocking the water spray. Not to mention the button to get the water to spray is extremely hard to press down. The tub itself is a nice size and comes with the sling which helps a lot. I recommend buying a regular tub with a sling rather than spending the few extra bucks for the sprayer that doesn't work that well. A cup or washcloth will do the trick.
1,what a waste ***do not buy***,This was a waste of money the shower attachment works all of 2 times ant the company won't replace it. Save your money use a small cup or wash-rag to rinse your baby!!!
1,Do not waste money on this item!,"This tub is a piece of junk. The sling is poorly designed and the spray hose broke after the second use. Please take into consideration all the bad reviews before buying this item. Unfortunately I ignored them and now have to go through the hassle of returning it and buying a different tub. I love the idea of the spray hose and our baby loved it the first time we used it, but if it doesn't work what's the use?"
3,NOT FOR LITTLE BABIES!!!,"This tub wasnn't convenient at all for my preemie. I used the sling in my kitchen sink at first as instructed. But the sling is so upright that my daughter did not stay up. I can't possible bathe her and worry about holding her up too! Also the material of the sling is scratchy and uncomfortable and she hates it. I've only used the actual tub & shower once so far and have no complaints YET. But the sling feature is not made for us people who have little babies, they just slide all the way down."
1,Toddler Tub Problems,I also should have read the other reviews on this item before registering for it. I do not like this tub for two reasons:- The shower feature stopped working after two uses.- The material on the incline stretches out so fast that after only two months of use (two times each week) my baby's head touches the bottom of the tub already.This was a waste of money since now I will have to purchase something else and my baby isn't even three months old yet!
1,Very dissapointed,"I registered for this tub because it looked like the best one on the shelf. The shower attachment never worked! We kept trying to change the batteries thinking that would help. Of course we threw out the box after we opened it (a lesson I have now learned never to do) so we couldn't return it. I have thought about contacting the company, but it sounds like another reviewer tried this with no luck. I still use the tub without the shower but my three month old baby is starting to get to long for it."
2,Don't waste your money,I did not like this this tub. It is very small and the sling is awkward and does not hold the baby securely enough. I never even tried the shower because I switched to another tub which I am very happy with.
1,Don't waste your money!,I bought this tub because of the shower feature that I have never even used. My son is now 8 weeks old and is already too long for the tub. His feet and legs get all smushed at the bottom and his head touches the top of the tub. He looks very uncomfortable! The mesh sling does not come off its frame to wash and it smells! You have to wash it with hand after every use unless you want it to smell really bad. I am going to purchase a new tub tomorrow!
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS,"My best friend recieved this as a gift for her new baby. She thought it was so convenient and would make it alot easier to bath her baby. Well, after only one use, the shower stopped working. Also, she wasn't impressed at all when she used it the only time that it actually worked. She was so upset and disappointed. She's not the only person this has happened to so I really don't recommend this product to anyone. I think it's a waste of money."
3,Take your chances,"I registered for and received this item as a gift. I was most interested in the shower feature. During the second use, the shower quit working. I found the problem and fixed it. During the fourth use the shower quit working, and I could not fix it. I contacted the company and they are sending a new shower unit to me at no charge. They responded to my complaint quickly. At this point I am disappointed in the product, but pleased with the response of the company's customer service department. I can only hope the new unit works for an extended period of time."
1,Only LOOKS like a great idea,"I was very excited to get this bathtub. It looked like such a great idea, and so easy. However I experienced the same problems as all of the other consumers. After only two uses the motor quit working. Turns out the batteries corroded inside and has ruined the shower. I had to throw it out because there was no way of fixing it. I have emailed the company about this problem. Hopefully they will rectify the problem with their product."
2,Big disappointment in product and company,"I received this shower/tub as a gift after putting it on my registry. It looked like it would be great, however, the shower only worked the first two times I used it, then it died. I contacted the company via email. I didn't get the friendly response I expected, i.e. some sort of apology or whatever, but instead received a flat, ""give me your address and I'll send you another shower unit"". Ok, fine...I received the new shower unit and guess what?...it didn't even work the first time we tried it! I contacted the company again several days ago and I'm still waiting for a response. I am still using the tub and sling (which is ripping and my daughter is only 9 weeks old) but she is already getting too long to use the tub in this position. She doesn't have much leg room even without the shower unit in there. I would never recommend this tub unless they improved on the design. It would be great if it worked!"
3,"Tub portion is good, shower portion is junk","I was wooed by the shower gimmick and, as with almost every other poster, the shower component was initially very weak then broke within a few uses. At first I was going to return it but I decided to research other tubs and evaluate the tub portion separate from the shower. I realized that the tub component worked well for my child, he can sit up on his own so I use it without the sling and he loves to splash around in the water. Looking at other tubs the only comparable one seems to be the Eurobath, which costs the same. So, if you buy it for the tub portion alone it still seems like an ok buy. If you just think of the shower part as a free add-on that, if it doesn't work didn't cost you anything, than it's not a bad purchase but if you buy it expressly for the shower you will be disappointed. All in all the tub portion works well for me, my baby is happy in it so it is worth the money (twenty-five bucks)."
1,Don't do it,Baby slid down in sling. Totally uncomfortable and cumbersome. Shower broke within a couple of uses. We ended up using a little inflatable duckie tub that we had gotten as a gift and we still use it 7 months later. Don't waste your money on this tub.
1,Not Suitable for a newborn,"Like everyone else, we were drawn to all the added extras with this tub and thought our baby could grow into it. We have only used it twice (without the sprayer) and our son slides off of the sling and is smooshed at the bottom of the tub screaming! We are very disappointed with the amount we payed for this product and wish we would have taken it back sooner!"
2,"Great idea, poor quality","I received this as a shower gift and have used it three times so far. The shower portion of it stopped working after the second use. The button needed a lot of pressure to make it work and then it gets stuck. When you release the button, the shower continues to spray. Now it no longer works at all. It's also difficult to hold the shower head and hold the button down, they could've had a better design there.The size of the tub isn't great either, but then again my baby was born at 23"" so I guess a smaller baby would fit better. The sling they give you isn't so great for a newborn either, my little one slid down and rolled side to side and he appeared to be very uncomfortable. So, I bought the BRU teddy bear sponge to put inside the tub and he lays on that much better. The shower idea is great, it just need a lot of improving."
1,less than impressed!,"This is probably the hardest to use baby tub, it is bulky and hard to use the shower with the newborn. the temp messure is barely legiable, and my baby hated it. My newborn kept sliding down and she barely fit length wise. She is 21inches long. I just used it for the first time before she went to bed and i am going to take it back asap. I think i will stick with the older style tubs."
2,THERE MUST BE A BETTER PRODUCT,"I loved the idea of the shower part and that the tub would ""grow"" with baby, but as with the other mother's on the site, I am very disappointed. The shower part is horrible, we tried it a few times, but the shower isn't strong enough to wash the soap off of our baby. It went back into the box. The sling was a nice idea, but our baby also slips down so far we are constantly holding her up. I like that she can kick back and I wish it was more hands-free. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,DONT BUY!!!,DO NOT BUY THIS!!! the actual tub is nice and big.. but the shower is a piece of crap..first of all the pump is too low..adn if yu close the lid all the way..the water can't get through it.. then it started going nuts.. the button somehow got stuck..and wouldn't stop..i had to wait for hours for the batteries to finally wear out..i wish i would have looked on here first!!! i wouldn't have wasted money that was much needed.. looks like a great idea.. BUT VERY POORLY MADE!! number of summer company 1-800-268-6237
3,"LOVE THE TUB, HATE THE SPRAYER","I really like the actual tub, now that my son can sit up. the sprayer is a piece of work. The first time I used it, the sprayer button got stuck and wouldn't shut off until the batteries were dead (I should have just taken out the batteries, but I was hoping it would eventually stop.) the sling didn't hold my son very well at all when he was smaller, he would keep sliding into the water. not to happy with this poduct."
1,WASTE OF MONEY - DONT BUY,"I really wanted this tub for my baby. I took it back after using it because the shower thing is [...]! The manufacturer packages it in a way where it is bent up so the water can not get through to work properly. Also, the button is hard to push to get the water out. i took it back for a standard tub. it is not worth [...]"
3,"Tub great, shower part disappointing","My son and I really like the tub. The sling is great for newborn babies since they are often slippery and hard to hold while bathing. We loved the shower concept but find the button is very tempermental and has to be pushed in just such a way to actually work. The base of the shower part, however, is nice to have clean water in by itself even if you don't use the shower top. When you can get the shower to work, it does help in rinsing baby's hair and back."
1,junk,waste of money the shower worked very poorly when it worked now it dosen't work at all. the baby sling was awkward for my baby to use we tried using it without the sprayer and that worked ok. blah
2,Shower hose kinks too much,"We used this for my son. The bath worked fine and we had no problem with the drainage. However, one of the main reasons we got this model was the shower/sprayer. What a joke. It worked if you held the handle with one hand, the hose with the other and hoped your child wouldn't tip over (we didn't do this!!). I would not recommend to anyone who is purchasing for the use of the shower."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I wish I would have registered for a different tub. The shower, which is what appealed to me, does not work well. The line twists and the handle is awkward to hold."
2,Not so great,"We don't use the tub much now, just the sling. My girls are 6 months now (25 inches) and the tub doesn't seem long enough with the sling in it. It might be nice when they can sit on their own, but right now they can't. We only used (well, tried to use)the sprayer once or twice. Now I just lay them on the sling in the tub and use my own shower sprayer. Needless to say, I'm looking for a bath seat now after struggling for months with baths."
2,Looks like a great way to bathe your baby...,"I bought this for my newest baby (our 3rd) and was excited mostly about the shower part. I have now used it 2 times and the shower part is not working...motor is,but no water is coming out. I'm going to email Summer products to see what I can do. Save your money. UPDATE...Summer Infant products did mail me a new shower, although that didn't work either...asking for a refund. What a shame, it was such a neat idea!"
1,A BIG mistake!!!!!!,"My son loves for us to pour water over him so I thought this was the perfect tub to move onto once he could sit on his own. I even bought 2, one for me and one for my co-worker who is expecting. It didn't even work once and when I called the 1-800 # for help they asked if I had ""primed"" it. Duh...no, where was that suggestion in the instructions 1st of all and secondly after really looking over the design I very well doubt it would have worked anyway. I'm just glad it conked out on me before I gave it as a gift."
3,Love the shower but............,"Even after readingthe reviews i still got this tub. We lovetheshower but the tub is useless....but all infant tubs are. I think if i were to do it again i would buy the infant chair instead, live and learn."
2,Uncomfortable,"I have to admit that I never used the shower option, so that was not the problem. My son was not comfortable in the sling. He also outgrew the tub very quickly. He would kick his feet and hit the hard plastic that was raised up to hold the water sprayer. We ended up using an inexpensive foam bath cradle in the tub or sink, and that worked much better."
2,Toddler Tub and Shower,"I purchased this product for my son, and he loved the shower portion. However, when I changed the batteries the shower stopped working. I have had problems with the hose tangling as well so that it does not spray a lot of water, but I can live with that. I have two friends who also got this tub, and the same thing happened to them."
1,A good idea needing improvement,"I thought hard before buying this, as it is pricier than others, but then thought the shower would be worth it. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Batteries are a pain to replace and do not last long. Button position is bad - fingers end up in the spray, misdirecting it. Hose kinked frequently and easily. Stream should be adjustable and stronger, when wanted. Tub should be longer. Worse, it stopped working intermittently, then stopped altogether. Button on top would stick, also, so you couldn't turn it on."
2,Not as great as I thought,"When I first started looking at this tub, I thought that by having the shower center it would make my life easier. Eh...can't say that that happened. The shower center really didn't work well for us. Sometimes it would work, sometimes it wouldn't. Also, the pressure of the water squirting out wasn't that great. Not that I needed to have a great amount of pressure to bath my son, but some would be nice. Also, where the button is to spray water is in a really difficult locations. The sprayer is kind of like a computer mouse, with the button on top. When you are trying to press the button, your hand gets in the way of the spray. Maybe this will be better for when my son is older, but right now at the age of 3 months, I don't feel that it is really needed. But I will say, the tub is great. It has a reclining board and no slip bottom."
2,Not all that!!!,"The shower part doesn't work very well at all. In fact after a month the pump would turn on on it's own. We eventually had to take the batteries out when we weren't using it. The tub part is nice, but the handle on it to hang dry doesn't fit you shower rod."
2,Disappointed,This tub seemed like a great idea until I got it home. I don't understand what all of their stages are? They claim it has 5 stages? The tub is a good size but what a waste of $$ that shower was! I'm definitely not happy with my purchase.
1,Horrible Tub,This tub is horrible if your baby is tall. My baby at six weeks old was kicking from the bottom and would hit his head on the top. He is too young to sit up yet so I had to go and buy a tub on an angle so he wouldn't hit his head. He was 21 inches when he was born. I used this tub twice and the sprayer stopped working.
1,big disapointment,"I requested this tub because the shower sounded like a great idea, well it was a big disapointment. The first tume we used it the shower didn't work. We finally got one that works but it was awful; the button didn't work well, the water came out some times. the shower would run without holding the button, and now we can't be bothered using the shower spray. Do yourself a favor, buy another tub."
1,awful,i was so thrilled when i saw this tub. i have a 4 year old and thought I'd update at least a few items with my new baby. right off the bat the temperature thing didnt work. then within a month the shower stopped working. in general it is too big for a full kitchen sink and too big really for the bathroom counter as well. i find this tub to be very annoying and i plan on digging out my tried-and-true $9 tub from 4 years ago. DON'T BUY
2,Get a different tub!,"I had registered for this tub b/c I thought it looked like it would be great. Once my baby was here, I found that it is not the best. The spray is way too gentle. It hardly takes the soap off of her. Also, the plastic part that holds the battery and water takes up way too much space if you put it in the tub where it is supposed to be.Also, now that she is almost 6 mos. old and can't sit up entirely by herself, we still need to use the sling. However, when she is lying down on the sling the tub is way too short for her body. Her legs have to be folded for her to have room. So now I have to look for a longer tub in order for her to have a comfortable bath."
3,Pleasant Bath Time,I think this bath system is excellent. I was able to use the sling in my kitchen sink for a while and then transition into the tub. My baby loves the shower and I like the angle she is at in the tub. This was a gift but I think it was well worth it.
2,"Tub is awesome, Shower stinks","I was so delighted to find this product. The tub has a spout! No more flipping heavy, water filled tubs over to clean. The shower was great (at first). Then all of a suddent it died! No warning or anything, just died. When it was functional it terrified my daughter because it was so loud. I was disappointed with the water pressure also. I couldn't rinse the soap out of my daughter's hair. I ended up using a sports mug with much success. Great tub, horrible shower. However I do love the concept, it just needs more tweeking."
1,Faulty Product,"We received this as a baby shower gift and thought it was a great idea. However, it was very difficult to manage our son, while trying to push down on the shower button because he kept sliding down the sling. The shower tub is positioned in a bad place for a BOY, if you know what I mean. The shower stopped working after 3 times. To our horror, battery acid leaked all over the inside of the tub, because they did not seal the battery storage compartment from water properly. This item should be RECALLED!!!!!"
1,Too good to be true,"We were so excited when we found this tub online. We could use the shower part for our oldest daughter until our new little one comes; and the tub was perfect for a little one. When we got it home and put batteries in the shower part.. it wouldn't come on. We thought maybe we did the batteries wrong and tried again. Still nothing! Finally, it decided to work but this time it would not go off. The motor is SO loud, it would definiately scare a newborn. Now, I don't know if it is the one we have or they are all like this, but I have to say we are VERY disappointed and plan on returning it. It was definiately too good to be true!"
3,The shower is not necessary,I registered for this tub because of a few positive reviews. I never got the chance to use the shower center because it's defective. I love everything else about the tub. The sling fit perfectly in my sink and now my son has graduated to using the sling in the tub itself. I still use the separate container to hold water and rinse off my son. I find the temperature gauge very useful.
1,Tiny Tub - Sucky Shower,"When I saw this tub at the store I thought it would be the greatest thing ever. I didn't use it until my baby was 3 months old. He's pretty big and can't hold his head up yet, so I still have to use the sling. Boy, does that thing suck. With the sling in the shower, my baby doesnt even fit. His legs are all scrunched up towards the end of the tub. Its horrible. I dont even think once he sits up it will be big enough. The shower unit is a joke. I got it to trickle, not spray, water for about 2 mintues, after that it wouldnt work. Not to mention, the button to make the water spray out is directly above where the water comes out, so if you dont hold the sprayer correctly... your hand blocks the water from comming out. I plan on returning to the store and getting a bigger bath ... without a shower trickler."
2,Waste of Money and Time,"I hated the shower attachment. It was beyond a slow trickle and was a waste of time and effort to put it together. The actual tub and the baby rack were good. I would put the Safer Bather--a must have for bathing newborns--on top of it to use and skipped the shower altogether. Just get a tub, a rck and the Safer Bather and your newborn is set."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,When I originally registered for this tub I thought it would be great with the shower built right in. Well I was able to wash my son using the shower piece 2 times! After that it stopped working. And also there is NOOO leg room for my son to kick around and play. His legs at 2 months were hanging out. And the stopper in the bath tub pops out so easily I had water everywhere a number of times. All you expectant Mom's & New Mom's out there don't waste your time with this and be as annoyed as I was. I returned it and bought the PRIMO baby tub which is great. He has tons of room to splash and play!
1,uncomfortable,"When I first saw the product I thought it was the cutest think I'd had every seen,and since I was having a baby after 13 years, I figured why not. Well from day one the baby just looked like he was soooooo uncomfortable. Where they have the shower part is where the baby legs are suppose to go. There was no room for the baby to lay flat or just have his legs straight. At this time time he was only 3 weeks. I decided not to put him back in there but at this point (he's only 3 months now) he's to long to try and enjoy it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I think the company should either give people there money back or replace it with something else."
1,OMG it Sucks,"I NEVER got the shower to work. I know most will think they are smarter than I, but I tried to un kink the hose, hold the hose way below the water level, siphon the water, fill the pump up side down, and 15 other things and nothing. I knew it was too good to be true. I am taking it back it sucks."
2,Nice Idea,"I am very disappointed with this tub. I was really excited about it when I saw it in the store and thought it was really what I needed in a baby bath. The shower control is very difficult to handle while giving baby her bath and it only works when it wants to. The water pressure is not very good and the streams of water are very tiny. Also, when the well gets too low it makes it very light and the baby kicks it all over the place. The bath itself is a nice size and I like the sling that she lays on but the shower is more trouble than it's worth! You're better off using a cup!!"
1,Poor shower feature,I was really excited about seeing a tub with a convenient shower feature but this item needs improvements. The shower button is very uncomfortable to use due to the position of the button itself. The hose is almost always bent making it difficult for water to come out no matter how hard I tried to straighten the hose. Sometimes the button itself sticks and nothing comes out...and then again sometimes it works.The only good thing I have to say is that the sling is comfortable for my daughter.But I am still looking forward to getting another tub.
3,It's an ok buy,"I recieved this for my baby shower and thought that the shower on the tub would be great. But the little bit of water that comes out is not enough to rinse off soap or to keep baby warm while washing. I like the tub for the fact that I can hang it up to dry. I disliked the support system that came with it, I felt as though my baby's head wasn't properly supported and it made bathing her more difficult. I don't use the shower part at all, I use the hose from my sink to rinse. In all it's and ok product, the shower part being the biggest dissapointment."
1,Nothing nice to say.,"I saw this at the store, and thought the shower idea was great. I also thought the sling would be helpful. Neither one was. The shower part takes up WAY too much room, and doesn't work well. It's easier to use a cup or a bowl to rinse my daughter. As for the sling, she HATES it. It makes bath time very awkward. In the long run, I wish I had gotten a different tub. I'm still looking for something better."
2,Shower seemed like a great idea but not worth the hassle,"I purchased this tub basically for the shower. My husband and I both thought it would be very useful, wrong. The shower takes up quite a bit of room in the bath tub itself and after a short period of time we couldn't even keep the shower in the bath tub while bathing the baby because it wouldn't fit. Thermometer was extremely difficult to read. Then there were times when the shower wasn't being used, with no water in it, it would run and I couldn't shut it off so I ended up throwing the shower out only after a few uses. I should have just gotten the plain, cheaper tub instead of spending more for this novelty. In closing save your money and use a cup to rinse your baby, it works better."
2,nice concept but has some kinks ...,"I was drawn to this tub because of its shower spray feature. I believed that the gentle spray would be less harsh and more welcoming than my kitchen sink's spray nossle. However, because of packaging, the tubbing had several kinks in it that would not come out or allow the water to spray. When we finally got it to work somewhat reasonably, we found that the reservoir tank didn't hold enough water. We had to remove it and the spray nossle entirely.Although I don't recommend this product, the net insert proved to be very useful. I use it and the tub w/out the spray/tank which were useless to me.I suggest you get a regular tub with the net insert and grab a cup. lol."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I recieved this tub for my daughter at my baby shower. What a waste!1. The shower part barely works, you almost break your finger pushing the button.2. The pad that the baby lays on will start to get a mildew scent, no matter how often you wash and clean it.3. There is not a sitting position. When my daughter can sit freely in this tub, I might as well put her in the regular tub.We got the ""tub to seat"" bathtub for our first child two years ago. It was wonderful! I wish we would have gotten the same one again!"
3,Not such a bad product,"Good points:1. the shower is soothing for my newborn2. the tub is portable and the handle turn into a hook for easy hang dry3. the mat is at a perfect angle to wash baby's head and then the bodyBad points:1. the push button for the shower is not at a good spot, which makes it a little difficult when doing showers alone2. the temperature gauge on the side of the shower is difficult to read"
1,useless!!,"I would reccomend this tub only to someone who has lots of free time to return it to the store because the shower doesnt work. which of course, is not very easy with a 3 week old baby.when i got the tub home i noticed that the box had been opened and taped closed again, as if it had been purchased and returned. that should have been a clue to me, but i tried to use it anyway. the shower did not work at all. it made a funny noise as if it were trying to work, but no water came out. and of course, my 3 week old baby was laying there soapy and screaming. i returend it to the store and was planning to replace it with the same tub, but when i got to the store, all 5 of the other boxes on the shelf had also been opened and taped closed again!!! im guessing because people keep returning this tub to the store but the store keeps putting them back on the shelves."
2,"Tub great, but shower feature pointless","We registered for this tub thinking that the shower feature would be great for the baby when he was to be bathed as an infant in the sink. Well, the sling doesn't fit my kitchen sink and the shower is a pain to use because when your hands are wet or soapy, like they are because you are bathing a baby, you cannot get the shower spray to turn on. I had to use two hands to depress the spray button. The tub itself is great - it has a plug to drain and a hook to hang it from your shower rod to dry. My son is long so I had to take the shower out for him to fit in by two months, but he loves to kick and splash around in it."
2,Fire Hazard!!,First off the tub it's self is great and i love the sling..the sling is great even alone for spong baths or in a full bath tub. But the shower unit is tricky. The hose keeps getting a kink in it and not spraying and the button is right above the streams of water so it's difficult to direct sometimes. Then the red wire in the battery compartment caught on fire somehow..short circut or something and made the top right battery explode inside the unit!! I would throw away the shower unit and just use the tub!
1,This tub is awful!,"We don't use the shower part, it's impractical. Most babies don't like to be sprayed anyway. But my problem is that the plug on the bottom of the tub opens by itself almost every time we use the tub! By the time you notice, water is all over the counter and the floor. Would never by this product again!"
1,Shower me disappointed,"I absolutely agree that this tub/shower combo is not worth the money or the aggravation. Luckily, we received this tub as a gift so we didn't waste OUR money on this product. Before I used this tub today, I read the reviews other parents posted to see how others fared. Low and behold, I received the same results. The shower was a good idea with poor execution. In addition, the bath sling was useless. My five month-old kept slipping in the tub therefore not allowing enough leg room for him. The temperature gauge on the shower insert is a joke. Do I need to go on? Long story short, I would NOT recommend this tub. K.I.S.S (Keep It Simple Stupid)"
2,shower feature was a waste,"Overall, I was satisfied with the tub but I feel like I wasted my money on the shower feature. I had trouble working it (you have to hold the shower head below the water level in the shower unit when it stops working)and the water in the shower unit turned brown. I used the tub by itself and used a little water bottle to ""shower"" my baby.One other criticism about this tub is that it is not big enough for big babies. My 2 month old is 15 lbs. and he's already outgrown this tub, but I'm sure for smaller babies it will last longer."
3,Tub is good but I don't use the shower or sling,"The shower feature was what drew me to the product, however, my baby is 9 months old and i've attempted to use it twice. I found that it doesn't hold enough water, and it's loud. When I tried it for the second time, the water wouldn't come out and it just made a loud noise. Some water came out if I fiddled with how I was pressing the button. Anyway, it seemed like more trouble than it was worth, so now I just use the tub and have a separate container of water with a cup to use for rinsing. I used the sling only once or twice -- I found that it got cold quickly and once that happened, the baby would scream. The tub is fine - good size and easy to pick up, empty, clean, etc."
2,Shower issues,"The shower unit stopped working after 3 baths. We thought it was batteries, we tried everything. It just stopped working. It is difficult to get the washcloth wet, although my 6 month old loves to lie on the sling and watch what's going on while I wash her, it does allow for her to rest so I don't have to hold her while washing. She is approaching too long for it now, I haven't the courage to advance to the big tub just yet. New parent. :)"
1,it WAS a good idea...,"This shower/bath set looked like a wonderful idea while it was still in it's box at Babies R Us.But when I got it for my baby shower and used it months later on my 1 month old newborn son,it was a terrible idea.The shower part was basically useless because the water pretty much drips out and the noise the shower makes is alarming to my newborn.So I threw out the annoying stuff and I just use the tub and and the sit-up net and it works perfectly!I wouldnt reccomend this product to anyone..save money and just buy a tub!"
2,Call Summer for replacement shower,"I received this at my baby shower back in August 2004. The shower part never worked, I just used a tupperware bowl and just dealt with it. I finally just called Summer (800.268.6237) and they are sending me a replacement shower right away. They don't want the defective part back. I am curious to see if I will get one that works."
1,bad investment please consider reinventing,It does not work I bought and returned twice it is a wonderful idea but someone needs to reinvent the product maybe use a big plastic container with a clamp to stop water flo I know they make a solar shower for camping and I think it is better idea only downsized and no batteries or battery acid on baby's shower/tub.Also I would not rate this with 1 star but I had to rate it as 1 or I couldn't write a review. I was so excited to buy as a gift for my grandaughter as they didn't have these things 21 yrs ago when my girl was born. What a let down and the baby was a newborn in the winter of Nov 2004
4,Great Tub,"I read all of the negative reviews about this tub, but decided to give it a try anyway, mainly for the shower feature. I have been using the tub for 6 weeks now and I think it is great. One time I thought the shower feature had stopped working. I followed the directions as to what to do if the spray did not work, but I had no luck. I even tried to replace the batteries. I e-mailed the company and they responded very quickly about sending me a new shower feature and no cost to me. After doing some experiementing with the tub I discovered that I had not put quite enough water in the compartment. I have not had a problem with it since then. The sling does not fit in my sink, but I have used it in the tub with my newborn, which works fine. The only negative thing I have to say about the tub is the shower compartment does take up a lot of room, but I just place it outside of the tub. I don't think I would be as happy with any other tub, and my baby loves the spray!"
2,fragile and no customer service,"This was a fun game until the ""flipper"" broke. I contacted customer service twice to replace it-received no reply either time. I would not recommend this game or this manufacturer."
5,Tired of CD's with only one great cut?,"Divine Excess lives up to its name in this collection of rock/jazz/blues numbers by Dallas's popular band. If you are tired of buying a whole CD just for one or two great cuts, you'll love Objects In the Mirror. Dee Schore wails like a 30""s Diva on ""White Water"" and ""Baby's Up and Left Me""; the band rocks on ""Find My Own Way"", ""Love Machine"", and ""Dr. K"". You won't be able to get the haunting melody of ""Two Eggs"" out of your head. Dee Schore's incredible voice and Ron ""Chainsaw"" Bell's guitar highlight this CD, a must-buy for those who like their music eclectic, Excessive and with a Divine edge."
2,Disappointing,"This scale looks great, but mine didn't weigh accurately. The indicated weight changed 1/2 to 1 pound, depending upon how my weight was shifted from foot to foot. The indicated weight was always about 2 to 2-1/2 pounds heavy. I called factory customer service and was told that there was nothing that could be done about the inaccuracy except to return the scale to the place of purchase, which I did. In fairness, I took it back and tried out all of the display models in this $50 price range, and none were any better, and some were quite a bit worse. I ended up buying the Soehnle Zeta model (for twice the price) with which I am very, very happy. (I have posted a review about that scale on the page for that scale.)"
1,"Accurate, but not for long!","Bought this (...) for Christmas. It worked fine for about 3 months and then it went crazy. It gave different readings each time I would step on it, sometimes is was 30 lbs off. I changed batteries and it did not help. Customer service had no answers, threw it away on month 4."
2,Gone but not forgotten,"These scales worked great for about 1 year. Then one day I stepped on them and found I had lost 20 pounds over the weekend and as I stood there the pounds kept melting away. As much as I would have liked for this to have been true. Reality took charge and I realized there was a problem, so; I called the manufacture, they said ""send them in and we will replace them with a new set"". So I did, its been about 2 months now and I am still waiting. After reading these other reviews it sounds like I was lucky that they lasted as long as they did. So maybe its time to purchase a new set, I'm pretty sure I will try a different brand this time."
1,Wildly Innacuate and Flimsy,"Had two of these scales. Amazon graciously replaced the first faulty one for free. The second one also had problems when the leg came off and I tried repairing it. I had suspected that the weight was inaccurate but this was confirmed when I bought a different scale.It turns out that my weight was 13 pounds more which is a bummer but it's nice to get an accurate measure with myEatSmart Precision Premium Digital Bathroom Scale with 3.5"" LCD and ""Step-On"" Technology."
2,Broke after a year,"I bought this scale at Macys for $50 last spring. Worked fine until last month when I noticed that the scale would indicate a ""bare"" signal. I looked at the user manual and it doesn't mention what that means. I too agree, that it is inaccurate. If you step on the scale different ways, you could weigh 5lbs heavier or 5lbs lighter. My opinion, scale looks nice but I wouldn't buy it again."
1,Disapointing,"Very disapointed about this DVD , which I thought looked like a home video , shot from a distance , hard to see clearly , people walking by as the camera rolls , very unprofessional , what a waste of money , sorry but thats the truth ."
4,Makes it easy,Excellent ramp. Easy to move my bike on and off since I can walk it up or down while on the ramp. Fits securely to the rear of the bed due to adjustable contact points and underneath attachments. Only complaint is that you have to be careful when folding due to the very sharp pinch points.
4,Clearly written introduction,"This textbook tries to strike a balance between the ""toolkit"" (how to use it) approach (supposedly) desired by engineers and the more rigorous mathematician's development. Speaking as an engineer, I found it not as intuitive as I had hoped (I'm more mathematically-oriented than most engineers) However, the book is clearly written and develops the arguments in small steps. Recommend it as helpful, but perhaps supplemented by more careful development."
4,a superb introduction to Valhalla!,"This is an excellent contribution to the many Rheingolds on the market. Haitink's pacing of the score is quite good - not too fast, not too slow -- and the orchestra plays on a very high level. James Morris, as Wotan, is amazing, and in better voice than his later foray in the role under Levine. The other singers are all very, very good, particularly, Zednik as Loge. Even the Erda, a cameo role, stands out. In fact, I can think of nothing negative to say about the performance. The opera's two and half hours went by quickly and enjoyably!"
3,The place to start if you want to sample Haitink's Ring,"You can't make a Ring cycle just because you want to. In the absence of a passable, not to say inspiring, Brunnhilde and Siegfried, Haitink's cycle from Munich was sunk from the start. But neither of those characters appear in Das Rheingold, so the singers here are good enough--all are expeienced German stage performers--and in James Morris we have the best Wotan of his generation.At its new midprice, this Rheingold is a good place to start if you want to experience what Haitink has to say in Wagner. I would rate this set higher except that the orchestra is not superior (compared to the Vienna and Berlin Phil. in the Ring cycles conducted by Solti and Karajan), while Haitink, then a newbie to Wagner conducting, too often lapses into his mode of straightforward, unimaginative leadership. Overall, this Rheingold is about equal to Levine's contemporaneous one on DG, which is marred by eccentrically slow tempi; it too boasts Morris's Wotan."
1,Mad Bomber more junk from China,MAD BOMBER TWILL BOMBER W/GREY FURThis was the worst hat I have every seen and it must have been for babiesI got large size firstthen xlarge secondthen 2 x and it was smaller than both the othersSTAY AWAY SPENT $30 DOLLARS IN SHIPPING COSTS AND STILL DO NOT HAVE A HAT
2,The Jury's Out Still,"Well there's no way this hat will come close to replacing my original Mad Bomber hat! The hat is lacking insulation, Other then that comfortable. I went after the leather with Mink Oil. Hopefully I'll get a few seasons out of it. For the price, maybe I'll just keep buying more.."
1,Buyer beware,"This item arrived in just under 10 days, which seems like a long time when the shipping charge for an item under 1 pound is $9.49. However, there was a hole in the fur covering the forehead large enough for me to fit my thumb through. How this passed quality control I haven't a clue. Customer support has been very disappointing. The Sportsman's Guide's policy for amazon.com items that need returned/exchanged is different from their general policy and I was told that since I ordered it from amazon.com that I would have to wait 10 business days for a return label, plus 10 business days transit back to them, plus time to process the return and a minimum of 10 business days for the item to be reshipped. The order was placed Jan 3, near the beginning of winter. According to customer service, I won't get a replacement item until mid- to late-February. Horrible item, even worse customer service. Hugely disappointing."
3,All in all...,This is a nice cap. The fur seems to cover my eyes a little but keeps my head and ears warm!
1,Rabbit fur?,"This item is made with rabbit fur, that alone makes it a ""hate it"" rating for me. My rating is based on the materials, as are many of the other ratings here."
4,Bomber Hat,This is a very warm hat. I got it for when I am snow blowing my driveway and you just can't beat it. I guess the only downside is that the hair from the hat sheds on everything.
1,Beware of confusing or misleading product description.,Beware. This item is not a collection of piano music by Bill Boyd. It is a two page single piece of sheet music that has been copied or separated from a magazine. Not as represented in the item description.
1,Immaturity at its worst...,"The Anthem is the worst single of 2002. Immature lyrics, poppy three cord riffs, and a singer with no talent vocally at all."
2,okay for light dusting of floors I guess,These are probably good for light dusting of hard floors. Not great for large particles that you would normally sweep or vacuum up. Not real impressed with them. Probably won't buy again. Old linen dishtowels or cut up t-shirt rags attached to the Swiffer handle work better for me and can be washed & recycled over and over.
4,Zen and the art of it wasn't......,"But it wasn't bad. This book is available at the Dollar General for a buck, incidentally.I kind of liked it but wound up confused at the end. Who's your daddy?This review will only make sense after reading the book, and maybe not even then."
3,"A ""Mike Mussina"" of baseball books","Like ""The Moose"" this book is almost great, but fell just a bit short. I really enjoyed the interactions between Henry and the other Oakland A's...very funny. It was an enjoyable book and worth the read, but not on the level of W.P. Kinsella."
3,A guy's beach read,"This isn't great great literature, but it does have a good dash of baseball humor similar to that in the movie Bull Durham, wives all men would like to have, and clearly explained scientific discussions - mostly on physical science concepts. All the science was well explained, although it also impaired the flow of the story.What I enjoyed were the parallels in the story with the paradox of ""Schrodinger's Cat."" Henry Spencer and his relationship to baseball is the dilemma of cat in the box. He doesn't belong in the box. But it seems he's meant or destined to be there. Throughout the book, there's this feeling of something dreadful about to happen to him, as could happen to Schrodinger's cat if it were let out of the box. Then Henry leaves the box (the team.) To tell more of the rest of the story would deflate what little strand of a story there is.Nothing to brag about, but enjoyable, nonetheless."
3,"Good book, but didn't make it out of the park","I saw this book on the librarian's recommended shelf, so I picked it up because it sounded fun. It was fun, and that's from someone who is not a baseball fan. It was quirky and the characters were enjoyable. But the ending left me flat. It was generally a good and easy read, but the last part of the book did not live up to its promise. It did inspire me to take up some more Mexican cooking, though!"
2,"Not a K, but not quite a basehit either","This is a book I wanted to like from the start. I thought it sounded quirky, and I kind of like quirky- well, OK I am quirky, so I thought the book would be a good fit. Baseball book, oddball characters, unusual setting, everything I would typically enjoy. I have read a fair amount of baseball themed literature and was looking forward to this effort. The problem is, the book did not quite reach me. The baseball didn't ring quite true, but mostly, the characters did not work for me. Others clearly like this book, and that's OK, I have read much worse than this, and Miller clearly had good intentions in writing the book, but it falls short. Of course maybe my expectations were too high but I think the fault lies more with the multiple story lines, which merge a little too neatly for my taste. Having said all that, I would still give Miller another shot. After all, writing is like hitting- nobody bats 1.000."
5,An instant hit!,"This toy was an instant hit as a Christmas present. I paired it up with the ""Horton Hears a Who"" book and it's been a favorite ever since.It's soft, looks great, was shipped quickly & packed nicely."
5,Really cute!,I bought this for my daughter who is in love with Horton and she sleeps with it every night. It is so soft and cute!
4,Excellent,"The author doesn't dumb down the facts and science, making this a great book for those who want more than a ""pop medicine"" understanding of the inner workings of stress. Fascinating, cutting edge information."
3,"Interesting, but...","First of all, I have to say that my Kindle Edition was not complete. The status bar showed 61%, I began to read the Appendix note, and next page - BLAM...I am informed that I am done. Right in the middle of a sentence, and I have no way to know how much is missing.And, for a book that is totally dedicated to scientific studies of effects of stress, a serious student would not appreciate the entire appendix being missing.It was quite interesting, although the last chapter or two I really started to get bored, and had the feeling that I was reading the same thing over and over again.....Definitely important, though, to let you know how BAD it is to stay stressed-out. Bad like you get brain-damaged and everything!!!Glad I read it. But wish there were more strategies for coping with stress. Actually, from the title of the book, I thought there would be much more about that."
5,Great,Good quality. I would and did buy another movie. Very funny movie. Jerry Lee Lewis at his best. Worth the money.
3,Un paso adelante para Arjona,"La música de Ricardo Arjona tiene dos características: la primera es el gran esfuerzo que pone en sus letras. Frecuentemente son originales y hasta entretenidas. Se le nota mucho la influencia de la trova cubana y de escritores y poetas latinoamericanos. La otra característica es la extrema sequedad y convecionalidad de sus melodias, especialmente de los arreglos de todas sus canciones, los cuales resultan predecibles y tediosos. Es por esto que ""Galería Caribe"" resulta una mejora apreciable en la producción de Arjona: al aventurarse dentro de los ritmos caribes, Arjona ""sacude"" un poco lo tedioso de su música, y ahora nos hace disfrutar sus letras un poco más."
2,Not such a great cd,I like only five songs out of 15 differnt song he put on the cd. This is not the first cd I have bought from Mr. Arjona. I also have his EN VIVO cd which is a lot better. This cd is pretty awful. I am going to by Santo Pecda also and I hope that that cd is better. I am giving it only 2 stars. Bad cd. Don't waist your money for 5 good songs unless you are a die hard Arjona fan. I rest my case. Thank you
1,Beware: This item is junk!,"If I could give a lower rating, I would. This ""closet"" has no redeeming feature to recommend it. The plastic pieces are weak and the hanging rod not long enough to hang anything meaningful. The rod bends out of place and falls down if you hang more than a few suits. The cardboard floor is useless and caves in immediately. The cardbord top is a joke and likewise caves in with any weight placed upon it. When you try to move the closet after it has been assembled, the pieces pop out of place, and you have to reassemble them. This thing is a nightmare from start to finish! Don't waste your money or time."
1,Doesn't last very long,"I bought one of these about six months ago, because it looked like a reasonably-priced digital scale without any unnecessary bells and whistles.About two months later, the scale simply stopped working. If I stepped on it, it acted like it was working but after five cycles through the display, it just displayed an error. This happened over and over, and I finally gave up and tossed it in the trash.Being a naive and ever-optimistic soul, I bought another one. Now, after a few months, it takes me between three and ten tries before I can get a reading out of it; mostly it cycles through its ""working"" display before giving up and giving me an error. Some days I just can't get it to work at all.When it works, this is a nice scale... it seems to be accurate, the display is easy to read, and it just generally does what it's supposed to. Based on my experiences with its reliability, however, I would not recommend this scale to anyone."
1,Zero Reliability,This scale is really bad. You can weigh yourself 5 times in a row and get 5 different weights. I think it under-estimates your weight which makes you feel great at first until you have a reality check at good scale. Don't waste your money on this.
3,"OK, BUT NOT THE BEST","I BROUGHT THIS DVD SEVERAL MONTHS AGO, AND WATCHED IT A COUPLE OF TIMES TO SEE IF I WOULD ENJOY IT MORE, BUT AFTER WATCHING ""TEDDY LIVE IN LONDON"" THIS DVD IS NOT EVEN HALF AS GOOD, IF YOU WANT TO SEE TEDDY AT HIS VERY BEST GET ""TEDDY LIVE FROM LONDON"" IF YOU CAN FIND IT."
1,"Remix this for todays standard, please","ughhh, it sounded worse than the old am transistor radios of the late 60's. This guy is a great singer but if you heard him on this dvd you would not agree. The acoustics and sound quality will make you disgusted. I painfully listened to 2 songs, went straight to the computer and listed it for sale. I still love Teddy but this recording is down right weak!!! I couldn't sell it fast enough. Thank heavens someone bought it. They really need to re-mix it. Also Tedd's band at the time absolutely sucked. Dont waste your money."
3,Teddy,"I never had the pleasure of seeing Teddy live and was looking forward to enjoying the DVD. I did enjoy it and I'm happy with my purchase. Now, for some of my opinions. The sound is good not great. The background singers wear some awful monk like outfit. I've watched several soul/R&B singers whose concerts were filmed in Vegas or Tahoe and those audiences in my opinion are too subdued. I'm not even sure some of them even knew who the artist, before they got tickets. Teddy really has to work hard to win them over, which he eventually does. But understanding how performers feed off their audiences I would love to see Teddy sing in front of his true fans. There are a couple of times Teddy walks away from the stage and you can't hear a word he says. You also learned that Teddy can not dance."
4,A Devil of a Game,"I had ordered this game previously--I broke it--so, I had to order it again! Some people have said this is simply a ""mash button"" game, but you know what? That doesn't bother me one iota! The game pretty much plays itself (thank God for simplicity), therefore, you won't have to pay $25-$30 for some guide to let you know all the ""tricks."" You have three modes: easy, normal, and hard. I've only tried a couple of times on the hard mode. I don't see how anyone can beat it. The easy and normal modes are the best. You have several characters to choose from and you'll find hidden and ornate treasure chests along the way filled with goodies! Although classified as a ""fighting"" game there really is no blood or carnage, so even the kiddies can enjoy.The game is a lot of fun--not offensive to anyone. Enjoy."
3,Dynasty warriors without the history,"Plays alot like dynasty warriors without emulating historical characters. Tries to vary chars with stuff like duel pistols, flame attacks, and multi-swords in a hand (claws) but gameplay has nothing new compared to dynasty warrior games. Less detailed tech tree or leveling system. Cut scenes before battles are pretty well drawn with goofy but sometimes funny lines thrown in."
2,Boring and repetitive,"I'm surprised at the high ratings here. This game is dull. You pick a character, run around a corner, and start slashing your way through entire armies.There's no finesse, the combos are overrated by others here, and there's no chance to kick back and look around.To be fair, that's not the game's purpose, as far as I can tell. It's purpose is to constantly throw you into massive battles against hundreds of enemies. It's a button-masher with almost no imagination involved.It gets 2 stars because it looks good and they didn't make it too difficult, but there's just no lasting fun in wading into a sea of easily-killed warriors and smashing buttons until your fingers cramp solid.Totally dull."
1,not reliable,"I returned the first one because it registered kg only, even when set to pounds. The second one worked for about 6 months, then started giving errors and incorrect weights nearly every time. When it was working, the accuracy was nowhere near the 0.2 lb increments in the display. When you step on and off it keeps the same weight, even if you pick up something that weighs a pound. Normally I had to pick up a pair of heavy shoes, about 1.5 lb, to get the weight reading to change. Fortunately it has a 1 year warranty - maybe my third one will work. Update: 3rd one has worked for a long time, but it has the same accuracy problem - it uses increments of 0.2 pounds but won't change the reading without >1 pound difference."
3,Too Repeatable,"I purchased this bath scale two weeks ago and while very attractive, I have my concerns about the scales repeatibility...it is too repeatable. I weighed my self 6 times over the course of 2 days with no one else using the scale in between. The scale indicated that I was the exact(down to the scale's .2# accuracy)same weight each time. Highly unlikely the way I eat.I then tried the same experiment but first steping on with a 10# weight and letting the scale read, then off, then on again without the weights. Weighing 6 times over the next 2 days showed 6 different weights. As I would have expected.I'm not sure what is going on but it seems the scale reverts back to the the previous weight if the difference is close. I will be calling their tech support group when I have some time. I've read one or two other reviews on HoMedic digial scales exhibiting the same problem."
1,Unreliable from day 1,"This scale never reproduced the same result. I moved it around on the floor in our bathroom and every location produced a different result (off by up to 3 pounds). So I placed the scale on one fixed spot. Now after 13 month the scale suddenly is completely off - my wife and I both lost 5 pounds without dieting ;) If you want a reliable product, don't consider this one!"
1,Defective,The scales did not work properly. Each time you stepped on the scales your weight differed as much as five pounds. Five pounds up and down in fifteen minutes is impossible. Never weighed you the same thing twice. I returnrd product. Maybe it was just a deffective unit.
5,Awesome,This disc rocks...it will be a crime if it sinks amongst the rubbish that is out there these days. This is the way rock/metal should sound. After hearing this my faith in rock music for now has been restored. Now go treat yourself.
4,"Bionic Commando, Baby!","Like someone else mentioned, Bionic Commando will probably be the primary reason to purchase this mini mix - It's still a great game and it is exactly as I remember it. The mix was obviously made for people that still care to play 8-bit games, and Bionic Commando is definately the highlight here, although Strider is also a worthwhile game (not one of the best, but certainly not one of the worst either).Final Fight seems to be the real throwaway game here, and I couldn't really imagine anyone spending much time with it. I can kind of understand why they included it, but just about any other Capcom game of the era would have been a more entertaining addition.For the few bucks that it would probably cost to purchase this mix, I think it's completely worth it for Bionic Commando alone."
5,Advanced Squad Leader is a book of rules,"Advanced Squad Leader is a game simulating squad level combat during World War II. It is a great game but the rules are over 200 pages long and complex. This ""book"" listed above is only the rule book. You must also purchase separately ""Beyond Valor"" which includes the game boards and pieces."
1,Could I give it less than 1 star?,"I didn't buy this through Amazon, but at a local bed and bath store. I realize most scales will give you a variance of a pound or two in between readings, but this scale would vary in the 15 pound range. What's the point of even weighing yourself. This scale is a piece of junk."
5,The best mini pump you can buy,"Planet Bike does it again! The best small pump, hands down! Use in hand or flip down the foot hold. Pumps on up and down strokes to 160psi, fully rebuildable! Great price on Amazon."
4,Planet Bike has Awesome Customer Service.,"I broke this originally upon receiving it since I didn't understand how to attach it to the valve cap. You partly unscrew the part of the pump that you push into the valve stem, then you screw it back and line up the thingys (you'll see when you get it) and pump it up. After breaking the screwy thingy, I contacted customer service and they sent a new part immediately."
2,"useful nuggets, but a lot of mud","This book is written for an academic audience, and is only of limited relevance to telecom professionals looking for historical perspective on their industry. A sample quote: ""Utterance is, for Saussure, the surface expression of a deep-seated mental competence. In Chomskyan terms...""The book's thesis - that today's ""information revolution"" is actually the result of a long-standing evolutionary process - should hardly be controversial to anyone versed in telecom or the development of new technologies. However, Winston is so set on proving his thesis that it becomes a real chore to follow the historical narrative. There are useful nuggets in here, but you've got to sift through a lot of mud to find them."
4,Print Shop PP 2.0 Works Well and Easily,"Print Shop Photo Pro 2.0 has a formidable range of things it can do while retaining simplicity of operation. It's almost intuitive. Unlike some newer applications, this one lets you do exactly what YOU want to do RIGHT NOW rather that making you jump through hoops."
2,Photo?,I am hoping that I underated the photopro...the reason I purchased the photopro was because I was under the impression that it came with a tuitorial guide..if it did for some reason it's not to be found on my copy..perhaps if I knew how to use the photopro I would enjoy it and give it the rating I'm sure it deserves and photo? could be photopro..
5,Upbeat with Depth,"Scarlett Taylor is a very talented singer. This CD is soothing on the ears & soul, as well as fun dance to. Her voice is sweet and yet has depth - a nice combination. This one was a pleasant surprise & I'm glad I got it. I listen to it often ""just because"" and at times when I need a mood lifter. Also got it for a friend as a gift...she plays it on her web radio show often."
5,A journey into a dark and complex mind,"I really hope this film gets released on DVD sometime soon as it is truly a rare and extraordinary find, a brilliant artistic acheivement. For those whose tastes run deeper than the mainstream and who may have a more than casual interest in World war 2 in general and Adolph Hitler in particular, or the very mysterious nature of evil itself, this film is a definate must see. The premise, portrayal and characterization indeed evoke the sense of a desolate self absorbed soul whose only possible source of comfort in an eternity of self reflection would be the constant reinforcement of his own pathological lies to any one who would still be foolish or gullible enough to listen. A soul unable to face ultimate truth, the realization of which could only equal pitiful agony and hopeless despair."
5,Buen análisis psicológico del Führer,"Esta producción, contrario a otras, se centra en la interioridad de la psique de Hitler, quien se ve frente a un espejo. La recomiendo a todos aquellos interesados en la biografía del Führer."
1,Full of regret on this purchase,"Been more than two months since this purchase was made and neither the seller nor HP can get the folder/finisher in this printer accessory to work. We have spent significant time by email and phone trying to get it right. It appears now that it is a missing software/driver issue that no one can explain. The selling ad says it is covered by a full HP service warranty, so our next move it to try that and see if we can make any headway."
3,Solid Live Performance ... Poor CD Production Quality,"Being a big Baby's/John Waite fan, I was very excited to see this CD become available. The song performances on this live CD are solid, but the sound and production quality are each very poor. The recording is (or sounds like) a bootleg, and there are production skips in a couple of songs. .The song selection is very good, but I was surprised that ""Isn't It Time"" (one of their highest charting hits) was not included. This is my favorite by the band, but they do include, ""Every Time I Think of You"", which sounds great. The drum and keyboard solos are fun as well and enhance the stage performance a great deal.Hopefully, the poor production quality will be cleaned up on future editions of the CD, and one day it will be remastered. If you're a Baby's fan, you should enjoy it, but don't expect a superior sound experience."
4,Babys - 'Valentine Babys' (Pilot),"Twelve track live recording of the Babys playing a live gig on Valentine's Day in 1980 in Denver, Colorado. Notice there are several cuts here off their best recieved (?) lp, 'Head First' ('78). Best described as - album pop, perhaps? Either way, 'Valentine Babys' is a worthy release. Best tracks include the opener - the Motown classic ""Money"", the inspiring ""Run To Mexico"", ""California"", a triple play of most familiar sounding tunes (I, for one haven't heard in years) ""Every Time I Think Of You"", ""Midnight Rendezvous"" and ""Back On My Feet Again"" and the rocking ""Head First"". Line-up: John Waite-vocals, Wally Stocker-guitar & vocals, Ricky Phillips-bass & vocals, Johnathan Cain-keyboards & vocals and Tony Brock-drums. One more thing: I had absolutely NO idea these guys were British."
3,i have seen the Babys twice in concert!,They are a great bunch of musicians! The last time I saw them was when they toured with Journey and John Caine left and joined Journey. This cd is okay but does not hold a candle to what they really sound like live. I would saay buy it but for no more 3 or 4 dollars new.. Thx!
3,Babys Live -nuff said!,"At this stage of the game, I'll take anything previously unreleased from the Babys. Sound quality is pretty good for a 1980 concert that was never intended to be released. There are far worse ""official"" releases out there, believe me.These guys rock! Can't put it any more plainly than that.Setlist is superb as well as the performance (a little clam at the beginning of Money -we forgive you John).There's also an excellent Canadian TV broadcast of the same tour out as a bootleg. Grab it....."
1,666 and the Number of the Beast,"I got this book from a friend who studys and collects books about the end of the world. This book is lavishly illistrated and conains several importent predictions about the comeing of the beast. I hate to give the end away but the Antichrist turns out to be none other then R. Reagan! This shocking revalation is based on te use of a number system that turns Reagans name into the number 666. According to this book he will return in 1996 to cast us all into the lake of fire starting with New York City. He will be aided in this task by the usual suspects: Alians, evil super computers, satan, masons, and barcodes. This book is copyrighted 1990 and predicts that the world will end by the year 2000. Today the year 2000 nearly over and Reagan is tragicly ill. Although hopelessly out of date it is still a wonderful look at the world of parinoia and fringe culture for people who like this sort of thing. At least the pictures are nice."
4,666 The Final Warning,The talking image prophesied in Revelation ch. 13 is described very well by Gary Blevins. An electronic image for buying and selling featuring Reagan became one step closer today ... as the ex President is being proposed for the new 10 dollar bill. I suggest dusting off your old copies of the book or buying another ....
4,Not enough variety,"NOW Estoy Es Musica! Latino is a good CD, consisting of most of the popular songs in the ""Latin culture,"" but it doesn't wander from latin pop and reggaeton. There are other spanish genres that this CD left out, including spanish rock and salsa. It's a good compilation of #1 spanish hits, and if you especially enjoy reggaeton and pop, then go for it, but it's still missing a little flavor."
3,Not quite complete,"It is true this CD is missing alot of Flavor. With that said, I don't claim to be an expert of spanish music either. But I do recognize good music when I hear it. I'm more of a Reggaeton fan than a Rock En Espanol or Spanish Pop Fan. Now with that said, the Reggaeton tracks featured on here are not the best. I can only think of 3 tracks of reggaeton that deserve to be on this CD. ROMPE by Daddy Yankee, Ella Y Yo by Aventura and Don Omar, Yo Voy by Daddy Yankee, Ven Baillalo by Angel and Khriz which by the way is an older reggaeton song compared to the other ones. For fans of Spanish Music but who don't have the time to try and find the various CD's of artists, then this CD is for you."
5,One of the BEST books no one has ever read,"This is a great book. It's got everything going for it: a great plot, interesting and likable characters, important themes, and a more-than-competent narrative style. It is also a great read -- fast and fun. So why hasn't it won ALL the science fiction awards and become a nationwide bestseller? Maybe because no major book publisher would touch it. Not because it's a bad book, but because it offers up the interesting idea that the main impediment to mankind's entry into space is NASA. And it provides fascinating tidbits of news that never made it into the newspapers about how NASA really works (or doesn't), especially concerning the Challenger disaster. Sort of makes you wonder about the First Amendment, when book publishers are afraid to publish a book that's critical of the government. Anyway, if you can find a copy, GRAB IT! And if you're the kind of reader who only buys one book a year, this would be a good one to pick."
1,A BORING BOOK FILLED WITH INNANITY,"I couldn't even finish this book. The only thing about it worse than the rigor mortis prose style was the innanity of the view expressed. According to Kelley, society will be magically transformed into Utopia once we start acting selfishly. Hmmmm. And I suppose elephants fly and the moon is made of cheese, too. This book's argument, such as it is, would be downright comic if it weren't so pathetically boring."
1,Disgusting and selfish,"How dare David Kelly attack welfare? Using demeaning terms like, poor people, Kelly becomes an imcompasionate fool. The majority of us don't know about poverty. But, then it is our to use it to help people is evil. This book ignores the needs of welfare and even says it responsibilty to help- in terms of welfare or other social programs. Somebody has the power help. Pretending they don't so they don't need encourages ""perverse"" actions. David Kelly, I'm sure an acomplished author and financially secure, has no right to make a judegemnt of this type. He doesn't need to worry about the bare essentials. For those who would like a true, harsh, and raw persepctive from, as Kelly puts it, the poor, please read ""Amazing Grace"" by Jonathan Kozol. I would like to see how Kelly would respond after being in the shoes of the people in the slums and ghettos.Kelly may not be evil, but his intentions are wrong and only in his self interest."
5,Read this Book!,"Heart-warming, inspiring, beautiful, and unlike anything you have ever seen or read before, God's Photo Album is a must-read for people of all ages. The story-behind-the-story is absolutely fascinating and will open your eyes and heart to see God in places you never thought to look. This book is life-changing - not only for the religious, but for everyone."
5,What a Miracle!,"It is difficult to put into words how inspirational and uplifting this book has been for me and other members of my community. At a time when our local Catholic elementary school was facing the real possibility of shutting its doors forever, I experienced my own miracle as I stumbled across Shelly Mecum's book in a local bookstore. How grateful I am for this experience. This book opened my eyes, mind, and heart to the real presence of God. Shelly's words, as well as the words and images shared by so many in this awesome book, have given me, and others in our school family, the hope, inspiration and courage that we all need to help our school persevere. The spirit and faith of those captured in this book are proof of the true miracles in our world."
4,Have you seen God?,"A thoughtful and insightful exercise on where we find God. The delightful reveiws given by Children, and those who wish they could have the innocence of children to find the true meaning of the search for God.I was dissappointed that the quality of the color reproduction of the photos was not sharper, but over all the stories and day of conquest was a very inspired and thoughtful diary."
2,buying without seeing,"I am disapointed in this book. Too much narrative. Photos too small.. Did not produce the promise of Shelly Mecum who spoke about the book on Hour of Power broadcast.Idea was excellent. Result was poor, part of $ for this book goes for charity contribution."
1,Not funny,Honestly there are million others things to read watch or do on the net and this is the bottom of the barrel
1,Online game parody of no value,"I only watched the trailer, but seriously, what is the point of this? It wasn't funny, it wasn't entertaining, and it doesn't look to me to be worth the money. I wouldn't pay 5 cents to rent and watch this primitive garbage."
1,"Low production quality, juvenile humor","This is just some guys gone crazy with a screen capture card and an old video game. They use the video game characters to ""act"", but there's really no acting here besides the voice over, and the dialog could have been written by 12 year olds (who knows, maybe it was). Definitely not worth any actual money to watch."
5,Feckin' Brilliant...,"One of the funniest shows ever made. For American fans of classic British humor like Monty Python, one of the most interesting things about this series is how similar and yet how subtly different Irish humor is--there's a lot of the same absurdist gags, brilliant use of language, and irony--but the Irish (or this series, anyway) seem to have a softer touch--it's a bit more self-deprecating and human. Great show."
5,Wish there was more,"My wife and I watched this series one episode every evening until completed. About a week after we finished with it she said "" I miss watching Father Ted"". Shows like this only come along once in a great while. We need more of them."
3,"Great series, too bad about the DVD","Father Ted is one of the funniest series ever seen on British TV. What an original and hillarious concept! The characters and casting are perfect. Episode 1 sets the scene perfectly - you will laugh your head off in every single of the 6 episodes on this DVD.And now for the negative side - The DVD contains nothing more than the 6 episodes that make up series 1. There is no commentary, no ""behind the scenes"", no interviews... As if that wasn't enough, there are no subtitles! I live in Greece, and most of my friends have limited knowledge of English and usually have to rely on subtitles to understand everything; as a result, I have a hard time sharing this excellent comedy with them. In addition, the menus are crude and I can only wonder why they did such a poor job on the authoring aspect of this DVD.Despite the poor authoring, anybody who loves Father Ted (i.e. everyone who has seen it) will definitely want a copy for their DVD collection. A must-have!"
5,Best Comedy,"This show is hilarious! I love it! It's a bit disappointing that in the uK their season consist of fewer episodes than here in the states, but this DVD is full of laughs I highly recommend it!"
5,One of my faves...,"My ex-boyfriend was Irish - and he was constantly telling me about this show... When I finally saw episodes on BBC-America.. I was hooked. The only other show that makes me laugh *this* hard is Fawlty Towers. Father Dougal is my fave, I don't know what it is about him.. he just cracks me up. It's such a classic show - definitely one I recommend highly."
5,"as a pastor, you gotta love this","absolutely hilarious. A sharp, funny look at religion and some of the eccentricities surrounding those who practice it vocationally.It's difficult to come up with funnier TV than this. If you like british (oh, okay... Irish) comedy, heck, if you have any sense of humor at all, you'll love Father Ted."
5,"Freak Pointing, Spinning Cat!","We saw an ad for ""Father Ted"" on the ""Coupling"" DVD so we had to get it. This is the funniest show I have seen in sometime. The humour in the show is very witty and very well written and the characters really grow on you. Father Jack is the best, I think he is one of the funniest comic characters to come along in some time. I just wonder why I have not heard of this show until now? I guess having BBC America may help? Episode one is great with the Worlds unfunnest fair to the last episode on the disc where Jack dies and leaves a will for Dougal and Ted: Hilarious!!"
5,R2 is better,"I have not seen the R1 version, but from other reviews, I belive that there is no commentry on this disc??? That's a shame, because the R2 version has a commentry by the writer Graham Linehan. So if your DVD player is multizone, I recommend you go and by the region 2 disc instead. The 5 stars is for the series, not the disc."
3,"Passable comedy, but overrated","As someone who, perhaps because of a genetic defect, appreciates a number of comedies that have come out of the UK over the years, I have to say that Fater Ted is just not that great. Not awful, but kind of boring and one-dimensional. A few mentally retarded priests get together, hilarity ensues, I get it. Only not so much, because it just ain't that funny. It has a few laughs, don't get me wrong, but just kind of fell flat for me."
4,Thunder,"Thunder: Not the loud scary kind but the rumbling under the surface rolling kind that seems to recall someplace in time and space grander than the space you're currently occupying.That underneath kind of rolling thunder has made it's way out of the Badlands of North Dakota in the form of Jesse Hanson and his fine band The Primitives.Haunting, soulful, voice, swirling someplace between Neil Young and Bob Dylan and lyrical content laden with a yearning for no less than the simplicity of a world we'd feel safe wrapping ourselves up when each day begins to unfold.Feel safe, wrap yourself up one morning in your favorite blanket on your favorite old chair, cup of coffee, your lover or your dog at your side, and spend some time with your own vision of that world or better yet your memory of it.And, oh yeah, you won't be disappointed if you bring The Primitives along with you."
2,Screws are junk,"My son's guitar only came with one strap button and he really wanted a regular strap. I ordered this in combination with a strap. The first bolt broke and was stuck in the guitar. I had to drill a new hole and reused the old screw without issue. After drilling the other hole, this one wouldn't become sturdy. There is too much of a lead near the head of the bolt so the second button is a bit loose. If you purchase these buttons, I recommend supplying your own screws.The buttons are okay."
2,Devours batteries!,"This shaver works as well as any other I've used, I guess, but it devours batteries like crazy. I can only use it 3 times to shave my legs and underarms before I have to replace the batteries. That really undermines the supposed low price. I wish I hadn't bought it."
2,Works fine for coarse hair...,"I got this razor as a gift from my mom to replace my last electric shaver, which no longer held a charge. The razor worked fine on my lower legs, where my hair is thicker and coarser (not great, but it did the job). However, on my knees and upper legs, where the hair is softer and finer, it didn't do much of anything. If I just wanted to wear capris, it did well enough, but for shorts I needed something else. So I gave it back to my mom for her to use.What I liked about it: the batteries. It takes up so much less space not having the charging stand sitting on the counter, and when the batteries die, I can just pop in new ones (we have rechargables). The battery on my old razor died after two years and was nearly impossible to replace.I got the Clio Palm Perfect to replace this one, and after only a few uses, I love it. It works so much better!"
2,Only okay..,I bought this raor on sale at my local store and it works only okay. The shave was not particularly a close one and I also tried to use it on my underarms and will not make that mistake again.
3,Actually a review of product description,"This looks like it might be the replacement I'm looking for. However, since the description of this razor and the other similar Remington battery operated razor doesn't mention the type and quantity of batteries it requires, I'll pass.This is becoming a pet peeve ... product descriptions that leave out the little but, to the consumer, very important information. A full description matters! Yes, and even on small items."
2,Not what the title says,"Ash Ra Tempel were like a lot of 70s bands: brilliant in 1971 and 1972 and then soon changing to meet the mellower expectations of their audience and the ""industry."" I read (in Chris Stigliano's excellent magazine Black to Comm) that the Private Tapes had several long ""jams"" from 71 and 72 that sounded like the side-long epics on the first two ART albums. That's what I would consider the best of the Private Tapes. Not this, which is mostly Manuel Gottsching's home recordings and new age-type noodlings. Luckily I bought this cheap used. Unless you prefer later Tang Dream to the earlier, raw stuff with the guy from Kluster, stay away from this double CD."
1,Annoying Fan Rip Off,"The CD is a total ripoff for all the fans who bought the 6 Cd Limited edition set. Everyone was looking forward to finally hearing the ultra rare studio track Gedanken. Having bought the set when it first came out (at what was a very high price) Gedanken wasn't on it. We then get this best of which mysteriously has Gedanken on it, the only track on this 2 cd set which isn't included on the original set.Yet again the serious fan has to shell out for a double CD of everything he already owns to get one important track.I expect to get ripped off by big record labels who do this sort of thing all the time but not from a small label run by the artist. The least he could have done was made that one track available seperately as a download or CD single."
3,Sound quality not as good as expected from the JBL name,These headphones certainly have extended bass but the sound quality is muddled. No clear tones. I recently bought the Seinhauser headphones that are $10.00 cheaper and the sound quality on them is much better.
3,Good but ...,"I have used it for simple classes (not music), the voice quality is good, but it press high on your ears and become annoying after a couple of hours.Also the wire is not long enough."
4,headphones 410,"Its been a great purchase, the sound of this headphones are one of the most goods i haved hear, in a few words:Its a the real sound of things on your ears. :)"
1,"Waste of money, even at the low price...","These headphones are the most uncomfortable headphones i have ever tried out. They sit on your ears in such a way that makes it very difficult to enjoy whatever it is you are listening to. The sound quality is awful as well. At first, you may seem impressed by the low frequency response of this headset. When listening carefully, the bottom end is muddy and muffles the midrange. The highs are very trebled and splashy. Unimpressive. You are better off keeping your ipod headphones. Adjustment mechanism is also very stiff, and springs back to tight."
3,great sound but uncomfortable,"I have owned these headphones for around 2 years. While I love the build and sound quality, it gets uncomfortable to continuously wear them. Since I use them mainly at work to listen to my ipod nano, I have to regularly take them off for a while. After a while I went ahead and bought the Sennheiser HD-595 Premier Headphone. Although its extremely comfortable, the sound is no match for these JBL headphones. So now I'm back to these JBL's."
3,average,it has the best sound quality. but its paining after sometime. u can not hear it for more time.
2,Sounds fine but they are uncomfortable,The headset has so much pressure on the ears it hurts. The sound is fine but they are very uncomfortable to wear.
4,Fantastic!!!,I just this minute received my jbl 410's and plugged them into my ipod. This is what I'm talking about!!! Nice!!! They sound clear and with a great balance of frequencies to boot. I highly recommend them.
2,really low volume headphone,"The headphone looks good, but it's a little tight on the ears and the volume is too low. If you are looking for a loud and comfort headphone, this is not the one."
2,High expectations - Mediocre results,"The sound is okay; not great, but not bad either. My issues are with the feel. I don't think my head is exceptionally large, and most headphones fit fine, but these barely reach my ears. They were hard to adjust, and while it's probably a by-product of the size issue, not really that comfortable for me. If they had an extra inch or two they would likely feel much better, and then being able to reach the center of my ears, sound better as well. As it is, I cannot in good conscience recommend them for the adult male."
4,top product,"Top product, good price. Had it shipped to India for 30 dollars, which was the price of the headfones!! Lucky guys you! Anyways, the fones are awesome..... sound quality top class, build is good..(im a pretty rough guy!!).. The only negative is it annoyingly sits on ur ear.. can get uncomfortable after a while..... if ur lookin at headfones to listen to high quality music not exceeding one hour at a stretch, blindly go for it!!"
2,Broke after 15 months,"While these headphones were a fine value in terms of audio quality and comfort for the price, the right earpiece just snapped off while putting them on my head. The plastic construction seems to be decidedly substandard. These headphones have stayed at my desk at work and haven't been abused other than normal regular use, and I'd expect more than 15 months of durability. Not recommended, my replacements will not be JBL."
3,"Good sound, bad design","Voice quality and noise cancelling pretty good. Volume though not maximal, can be adjusted more from the player. Band was tricky to adjust. At first I thought it was very short, and would not fit an adult head. You have to pull one end, hold it, while pulling the other end. It's a bit tight on ears, it gets uncomfortable after wearing it for a long time. Good sound, not very comfortable."
1,Very Very Small,"These headphones are not accurately represented in the picture. I do not have a big head- but these were way too small for mine. In addition, the part of the headphones which goes over the ears is about the size of a quarter. If you are a 10 years old or have a very small head, perhaps these headphones will fit you- otherwise, buy another brand."
4,Bang for the Buck!,"The price point is what convinced me to give these JBLs a try. I've had experience with JBL products in the home and was impressed with each.These are no exception. As some other reviews have indicated, these headphones certain accentuate the lower end of the sound spectrum - a nice departure from the Shure in-ear phones I'd used previously. They don't block or deaden surrounding sound, which is fine in my case because I use these in my daily commute and would want to hear the sound of a horn or siren in the vicinity.I highly recommend these headphones!"
1,Caveat emptor,"this is the worst product of this type I have ever encountered....Packaging:very difficult to open...Sound: overemphasis on a muddy bass tone without adequate balance for the mid (speech) frequencies....Highs: non-existent....Head phone hardware...too stiff and non-conforming....They should not have labeled this product ""Reference."".....the give-away headphones have more midrange clarity...this is not a product for serious listening or a Senior citizen who has some high frequency hearing loss...."
4,favorite,Listened to it ad soon as got it! This is 1 of my favorite CD to listen too! Couldn't find it in anystores
4,good book to read,"It's an amazing book to read for data mining, from statistics perspective. after reading this book, try to do a project by using ideas you learn from it. Then you will be surprised to find that you are an ""expert"" now! How great it is! Just have a try!"
1,"Very, Bad Book !","I was very disappointed in this book. There are so many other books in the field of Data Mining that are so much better. This one has very little to offer.It does a poor job explaining the theory.It does a poor job giving practical ""hands on"" advice.SAVE YOUR MONEY, AVOID THIS BOOK !!!"
1,This is NOT a Data Mining Book .. But a bad statistics book,"Finally .. I recevie the book .. I read the list of content and I surprised about it .. and now I know why they dont write the contents here to read before bying the book ..This is a bad statistics book, you can read any thing in it except about Data Mining ... No Cluster Analysis .. No Nural Networks .. No Rule induction No Dicecion Trees .. Nothing and nothing and nothing ...And I want to sell this bad book which Name is Data Mining ... for the three lier writers.Mustafa Ebaid"

3,make sure you are right audience,"It's not that this is a bad book, but you have to make sure you are right audience. The book offers very high-level overviews on various techniques of data mining, but it is almost impossible to learn how to really implement them. Since there are no exercises after each chapter you probably already know who the target audience of the book are."
2,A Major Disappointment,"I've read most of Townsends other books and value them highly both because I like the way he writes and he imparts informative data. In particular, I like his ""The Backpacker's Handbook."" This new book is a major disappointment. It bills itself as an encyclopedia but lacks the indepth articles that typify that type of document. It format is more closely aligned to that of a dictionary. Topic words are defined but no attempt is really made to turn the defitition into a ""how to"" article. You can read the entire book without learning how to do a darn thing. Additionally, there is no new information that Chris didn't already put in his Handbook. In some cases, the text is lifted verbatim from ""The Backpacker's Handbook."" A major disappointment. Don't waste your money."
1,Very disappointing,"Expecting an encyclopedia..did not get it, maybe not possible in the 400 pages. It lacks the real bushcraft en real detail. No added value for me looking at the other books I have."
4,Take a chance,"Was skepital at first due to all the negative feedback people wrote about the item, it was too late to turn back since payment was made, but im very happy with the product and its wonderful, use it everyday to make my salad, highly recommend it espicially if you are on diet and dont want to have the hassle of cutting up vegetables everyday. Must advise that all vegetables need to be cut into pieces first in order to fit in the cutting surface. Bit dissapointed in the delivery charges, way too high. But overall im delighted, will recommend to friends"
5,Love it!,"This product is great. I held off getting it for a while, but it got such great reviews by Consumer Reports that I finally purchased it. What a time saver. I use this for everything. It's easy to use and easy to clean."
1,Waste of Money,"DO NOT BUY THIS!!! It does not work ""As Seen on T.V."" We were able to get it to cut a cucumber and that was it. Would not cut a tomato, onion, carrot, apple only a cucumber. Complete waste of money."
2,Takes small pieces only,"I had visions of cutting up whole apples, onions, etc with this devise. I was greatly disappointed that the wire cutting surface is not strong enough for that task. Instead, one must cut up the apple into slices first then it will cut the fruit into salad-size bites.The wires on the frame easily get misaligned as well so be prepared to fiddle with the chopper using that little pick to keep it maintained.I really feel the commercial is deceiving and the chopper does not perform as advertised."
3,IT'S ALRIGHT:(,I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE I HATE CHOPPING ONIONS AND THIS WOULD DO IT QUICKLY EASILY AND WITHOUT ME GETTING TEARS IN MY EYES.IT DOES WORK HOWEVER SOMETIMES I HAD TO PLACE IT ON THE GROUND AND LITERALLY PUT MY WHOLE BODY WEIGHT ON IT TO CHOP BUT HEY I DIDN'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT WAS STILL EASIER AND QUICKER BUT IT WAS A REAL PAIN IN THE YOU KNOW WHAT TO CLEAN TOOK FOREVER WITH THE STUPID LITTLE COMB THING THEY GIVE YOU THAT WAS AWFUL AND EVENTUALLY THE THING BROKE.I BOUGHT AN ELECTRIC CHOPPER TO REPLACE IT.IT WASN'T TERRIBLE IT WASN'T GREAT NOT A LONG TERM ITEM IF YOU USE IT FREQUENTLY AND NOT FOR PEOPLE LIKE PERHAPS ELDERLY WHO WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME PROVIVIND THE PRESSURE TO GO THROUGH THE ONION.Progressive International GOC-300 Onion Chopper
4,Not perfect but really helps,"I received this as a gift as my parents know how I love to cook. It does work well for all vegetables and fruits. I prefer to hand chop as it saves clean-up but if I'm making soup or something like that which requires a lot of small chopped vegetables, it works like a charm."
1,Threw it away,I threw this away after one attempt at using. The picture shown is misleading. I had to cut the onion in smaller pieces and even then had to lean heavily on the top to get it to slice.
1,Disappointing product,I thought I was ordering the Vidalia FooD Chopper. Instead I got the Onion Chopper. It was for a gift since I had used the Vidalia Food Chopper for over a year and really enjoyed it. I was very upset when I found out that the gift I sent was only a small knife onion chopper and then the person who received it promptly broke off the corner of the plastic. Apparently this product is not warranted for breakage!!! BEWARE
1,Got 1 star because you can't select No stars,"To make this product work, you need to cut the onion into such small pieces that you might as well chop it by hand. This is another example of a product that was not adequately testing before being put on the market. Save your time and money, look elsewhere for a quality food chopper."
3,Its okay,"I have been using this chopper for last few years, however one negative side is whatever size of onion or any thing you want to chop you insert on the blade portion , you need a heavy hand to pull this down and if you use a too too heavy hand it breaks,this is my second chopper i have purchased now- reason for me being a returning customer is that it does chops veggies really fine."
1,Hard to use!,"This item is very hard to use. I had to step on it to get enough pressure so that it would go through the onion. It is also very hard to clean. I had to get a toothpick out to get all the onion out of it, and it still smelled like onion. It is much easier to just chop the onion crying and all."
4,Excellent soca compilation,"Beautiful music makes me feel at home. Great beats fun to dance for those of Caribbean origin who want to WINE, WUK UP this is it. For those who aren't and want to know how to GYRATE get this CD as a good start!"
1,DID NOT FIT MY CAR EVEN THOUGH IT SAID IT DID.,"I should have checked before i opened the package, but I really wanted to see hoe it functioned before i drained my oil. The thread size did not even come close to the same as my car (1962 Olds Dynamic 88) check you thread size before you order."
4,The major labels must be ASLEEP!!!!,"Jr. Jazz has an R&Bish style voice, smooth and powerful. His songwriting is polished and well thought out. He could easily write hits for any pop artist. Just on a by the way, did you know he has played with Mary J. Blige among many others??? He is well respected in the reggae community as well as the music community in general. This CD is a nice addition to any music collection......"
5,saved me !,"I added some threadlock to some bolts I shouldnt have and stripped em accidentally, these extractors saved me and they are reuseable."
1,Extractor snapped immediately,"The four extractors seemed well designed. The drill bit side did not cut quickly, but it cut, and the extractor engaged tightly with the broken bolt... and unfortunately immediately snapped. I followed the included instructions and used a modest cordless drill.I'm adding an image of my broken extractor. Wasted time, wasted money."
1,Doesn't grab like the title.,"I had 3 stainless steel broken screw heads in my boat. I bought two sets of these. The larger set from Lowes and the Micro on here. They seem to cut well but when I switched to the screw side of it, it wouldn't grab the screw and just kept spinning. I am thinking I should have used a easy out instead. I also broke one of them. Just didn't work as designed."
2,Not the greatest...,"Painfully Shy really did not ease my struggle. I bought the book on the premises that I might be a social phobic, but I was still as lost after reading it as I was before. Some sections were helpful, but it just wasn't enough. I was sort of disappointed. But it wasn't a total loss."
3,Maybe Im not...,"I used to avoid people and any kind of social gathering. I was never painfully shy but I thought my avoidance was just a coping method for my social phobia or shyness or whatever it was. I think this book is for those who sweat bullets and turn red when they talk to a person, that was never me. Painfully Shy is for those who are painfully shy. Period. If yours is a slight social phobia or avoidance this book is probably not for you. I was never told I was shy. I just avoided people. Even though this books tells you a lot and it is good, it didnt help me with my situation. Or maybe I had already read many books about it and even shedded my shyness/avoidance to a great extend by the time I got this book so if you are visibly shy or at the beginning of your change process, read it."
2,Disappointed,"This is the first and only book I've bought concerning social phobia. Perhaps because I had already researched this subject on the web, a lot of the suggestions in this book were common sense and obvious. Too much was devoted to explication (e.g., what causes anxiety, nature vs. nature, what are SSRIs, etc.) vs. providing actual suggestions which I thought was a waste.Was I expecting too much? I don't know. There weren't any revelations in this book. Even the anecdotes were a disappointment, I wished the author fleshed them out more. This book may be useful for those comletely NEW to this topic, but I suggest you look elsewhere if you want to delve deeper."
5,CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!,"I can't believe the prices that are being charged here! You can buy this book from the publisher, National Christian Press for $12.95 NEW."
5,Starting at the End,"This is my first Blackford Oakes book and it happens to be the last in the series. So, I am happily looking forward to reading all the others. And if this was one of the weakest of that series, as other reviewers here allege, it looks like I'm in for some great reading because I found this to be a most delightful book -- well-written, good plot, good characterization. Fascinating look at how things worked -- or didn't -- in twilight Soviet Russia. I think I'm going to like Oakes as a protagonist as I plow through the other books. All in all, it was a good and rewarding read."
4,Neophyte enjoyed,"As someone who recently graduated from the ""cheapest on sale at the grocery"" style of wine buying, I found this intro of real value. The overviews of regions, varietals, and other, more subtle nuances gave me a straightforward method of choosing wine whether in the grocery, a wine shop or a restaurant. I've enjoyed my choices more and paid less since reading this book."
3,La Guardia: a man for our times,"The book reveals with intelligence features of La Guardia's character, political behaviour and remarkable human sides.It is however, not a very satisfying book especially since we consider today La Guardia as being a precursor of the New Deal ideas and a socio-economical reformer who could well understand that there was a limit to America's notion of universal power based on the idea that in this country's spirit was engrained a moral superiority by which the entire world should act and respond. The book is somehow shallow, but it does not intend to be something else than that. La Guardia's political personalityacquires in our days a grandeur of its own: he emerged from Crisis and Depressions as a winner, a moral winner. From this point of view he stands close to President Roosevelt, and his inner circle,to those few enlightened persons to whom the Western World owes much. Giancarlo Riccio"
5,i'm buying this for my husband,"This book is one of my all-time favorites. I remember reading it when I was little, and feeling so sorry for the poor little man who could not read. I have told my husband that this books reminds me of him so much...I send him to the store to get me sour cream and he comes back with cottage cheese! This book teaches not only the importance of literacy, but also the importance of empathy for others. You can't help but feel so bad for the little old man, and you cheer him for learning how to read. I read this book when I was 7 or 8 years old, and now I'm 31 and still enjoy it just as much. I love seeing how excited my kids get when I get out ""Mommy's book"" to read to them."
2,"Not terrible, but the worst of both worlds","I would have difficulty recommending this book to either a statistician or an astronomer. As a statistician, I felt that the book was lacking in detail about the astronomy, thus making it more difficult to understand the subject matter. Similarly, I feel that an astronomer would have difficulty following the statistics, since the explanations are fairly brief."
4,The Aikido Student Handbook,"This is a straight forward, informative source of informationfor those interested or newly started in the study ofAikido. It details proper etiquette, procedure, andexplains many of the minor details of being an Aikidoka(student) that your sensei may assume you already know.O'Conner makes many good comparisons, and moves through therudimentary aspects of training in Aikido at a speed thatanyone can understand."
2,Includes nothing on training,"This is not a very comprehensive book. Some of the material is duplicated throughout. There is nothing on the actual techniques or methods in the book. If you are interested only is something that discusses etiquette and the approach MENTALLY to training, then this is a great book."
4,great for beginners,"If you are a beginner (in the first few months) this is a great book. Not just an eye-level, unconvoluted, unpretentious introduction to the philosophy and aims of aikido, but also deals with some of those universal questions of most beginners- like how to approach practicing with veterans. Nice, pleasant read, which will only increase your enthusiasm."
4,Excelent introduction to Aikido (if you don't know anything),"This book proved to be a great intro to Aikido and martial arts in general (especially Japanese ones). It included discussions on practical Aikido, weapon forms, dojo edicate, everything (and it was the only one I have found that came straight out and said how long it takes to become a black belt - 5 years). But, if have already taken martial arts and know something about it, this book might be a little basic for your needs."
4,Great start for Aikido beginners,"As a beginner in Aikido, I found the book helpful in demystifying some of the etiquette and language, as well as providing a good backround on the sport and some of the philosopy. I would recommend it to any beginner and expect that it will remain on the bookshelf as a reference to many of the terms used in Aikido."
5,A small yet immensely satisfying.....,"...self-help book in the form of a fantasy! I don't want to say too much about the book, but if you feel stuck in your career, or you feel like you are spinning your wheels, try this book. It is remarkably only a buck, but it packs a real punch. It might help you unlock the secret of the genie's lamp. Also, if you are a fan of mystery/thrillers, try Spoelstra's terrific thriller, ""redChaser"", also available for only a buck. A terrific historic thriller, one I couldn't put down until I was done! Thanks to the author for keeping these wonderful books so low-priced....."
5,Stila rouge lip stain defines perfectly and lasts all day!,I simply adore the color and love how perfectly it defines and how it lasts all day without drying my lips!
5,Great old time TV,"At last the Littlest Hobo is back in circulation. I remember watching these programs when I was a kid, and did not think they existed anymore really. They were probably not the most popular programs around,but I remember watching them on Friday night with great enthusiasm.It brings back great memories of when I watched these with my brother and friends, and of my first dog,Pal. Being in black and white only adds to the mystique.A really great DVD, of a simpler time, when we were all younger,[had more hair] and it took less to entertain us.Highly recommended, and hopefully more issues will be releases soon."
3,Not what I remember.,"I'm 33 and remember The Littlest Hobo from when I was a kid. I don't remember any of these. They look a lot older and the thyme song isn't the same as what I know: ""Maybe tomorrow you'll want to settle down. Until tomorrow I'll just keep moving on"". Happy I didn't pay a lot for this."
1,The Littlest Hobo vol 2,"Dont waste you money, if you have vol. 1 you have the shows. Vol. 2 is just a copy of a few of the shows on Vol. 1"
5,So Good In So Many Ways,"Diana Joseph writes with heart, wit and intelligence. Each story in this collection reads wonderfully on its own--""Schandorsky's Mother"" is my favorite--and builds toward a unique collective vision of motherhood. This should be required reading for every parent. Diana finds a rare blend of metaphors to access those painful struggles and exhilarating joys that make child rearing such a punch drunk experience. This is so good in so many ways."
2,Coffee: A Wild History,"I recommend that you peruse the pages of this book at your local library or book store prior to purchasing. The author has compiled 308 pages of supposed facts, ideas, opinions, and ""objective illumination."" No doubt some of the data provided is true and the first 83 pages engross the reader to the beginning of the history of coffee. Unfortunately the narrative then seems to fall apart not because the information may be false or questionable, but rather the author goes off on tangents which seem to simply fill up the pages. Is Rimbaud's influence on Bob Dylan and Patti Smith necessary in the discussion of coffee?There comes a point when the reader realizes that the author's writing is more of free flow of thoughts and assumed facts. Add to this the lack of citations and notes (which the author fully acknowledges) and the book becomes a jumble of many figures, dates, places and people that lacks organization."
1,Coffee leaves a bad taste,"I should have had questions when the reviews on the back cover are from newspapers that I never heard of or can can not find the reviews on the internet.The book is a series of dark attacks on the major coffee distributors, with not any attacks backed up by any documentation. If an attack is to be credible, the author should be sure to cite the source.For example: on page 9, he makes the claim that 14 Mexican coffee workers were found dead in Arizona because the coffee growers in Chiapas could not get a good price for their coffee beans is quite a flight of fancy and should definitely state the source of this fact.Also of note on the flyleaf he claims to have introduced specialty coffees in the U.K. This should indicate that the report that he gives contains a bias against his competition.The book is very disorganized and he can not seem to stay on the subject."
3,Potent brew,"Anthony Wild takes us through the velvet history of the darkest of drinks,touching on biology, culture, slavery, exploitation, Napoleon, St. Helena,Rimbaud, Starbucks and whether or not Balzac really drank 60 cups a day.From obscure origins to mass consumption, Wild roasts an aromatic tale. Recommended."
4,Decent Glasses,"I bought these for my younger sister's first apartment. They are perfect for something like that. They aren't anything special, but they are nice for everyday use. Just what I expected. :)"
3,Very enjoyable,"Not a scholarly work. Seems to be based on research of old Hustlers, but on the whole very enjoyable for a Vandy alum. Now I know who all those buildings were named for, and what happened after I left."
1,Arrived late,"Not sure what the problem was, but this arrived late....after my niece left for her college interview at Vanderbilt...thus it is of no use to us."
4,Loved it!,"Sophie Dunbar never disappoints and this send up of the beauty pageant circuit is as funny as all her other books. After being unavailable for so long it was nice to be able to pick up the second installment of the Eclaire books. The characters are genuine and warm, they'll remind you of your best friends. This is an author who really knows how to write believable female characters. Don't miss this series."
5,This song is too sexy!!!!!,I reckon this song rules!Sexy vocal and sexy rap. I don't undestand what woman say but it is too great!
5,I love this song because I love Dru hill.,"I love this song because for one, I love Dru Hill and the beat to the song. I don't fancy the one with the rap but I still give this song the highest rating there is. I also hear the movie is awesome. I want to see it because I like the soundtrack. Dru Hill is one of the best groups after the Backstreet Boys and MatchBox 20. I don't quite understand what they were saying but hey, who cares. The song is worth your money and believe me I know, I bought the cassette. The song has a fast beat and the rest of the CD is just wonderful. I would advise that you go buy the CD."
4,Good song...,"There are two versions of the song on the single, one featuring Redman and one not. There's also a preview of their upcoming CD, with snippets of three of the songs on it."
2,Didn't fit our 2004 Stratus,Didn't fit our 04 stratus...cost more to return it than it was worth...which I'm sure the company that is selling this is counting on.
3,surprisingly fun,"I'll be honest, I'm a fan of B-movies, especially unknown sci-fi from the 80s, which this is. For what it is, I actually really liked this. The story is fairly original, though like so many bad sci-fi before it, it rips off most successful sci-fi films. Carrie Fisher stars in this film, and she seems to STILL be playing princess leia, as her character is pretty much the same. If you like cheesy but fun sci-fi, this is definetly worth watching. If you do watch it, note a scene early in the movie when there is a scrolling marquee in the background. A line of letters and numbers are scrolling across it, and if you look close, you will see R2-D2 and C-3PO scroll by."
4,What a wonderful thing!!,"When we first had our baby we were living in an apartment that did not have a dishwasher. It was a PAIN to have to sterilize in boiling water, so we bought this. WHAT A WONDERFUL IDEA!! I was able to sterilize a few bottles, nipples, pacifiers etc at a time, right in the microwave. I don't know how I lived without it! Now that we own a home and have a dishwasher I no longer use it, but it is GREAT if you do not have a dishwasher!"
3,Not too useful,We Have many bottles that do not allow steam sterilization. We registered for this and used it on a few bottle right after we bought it and it has since taken up cupboard space. May be god if you make sure you buy bottle that work with it.
1,Unecessary Item,"I didn't care for this at all. The thing that really turned me off to it was when when it came out of the microwave, it had this plastic smell to it. It doesn't hold many bottles, especially since I use the Dr. Browns bottles. Trying to get everything to fit in it is a pain and time consuming & I have to do it in two or more rounds. I prefer to do it the old fashioned way...boil a pot of water & dunk everything in."
2,Waste of money,"My husband and I purchased this item to sterile bottles and nipples for our daughter. It wasn't long, however, before we realized that we didn't it. The dishwasher sterilizes the bottles just as well as this microwave steam sterilizer does, and it you don't have to find an extra place to store the dishwasher. In addition, many of the toys, nipples, and nuks, etc. only need to be sterilized for the first use, and need only be washed afterwards. I gave the product two stars because it is easy to use and clean, and could be nice for someone who doesn't have a dishwasher. Boiling water works just as well though."
1,Wouldn't recommend it...,"I wouldn't recommend it because I NEVER USE IT. I used it once and it works ok but I rather just put the bottles in the dishwasher. It's the same idea, and it steams them too."
2,Does NOT fit Dr. Brown Bottles,I bought this after reading the reviews and noticed one person said something about not fitting the Dr. Brown bottles. Everyone else said they did fit. Luckily i saved all the plastic so i could return it if they did not fit. And sure enough the big bottles do not fit. The lid is about 1/2 an inch open.
5,Gets the job done.,"This was definately a great buy for these reasons...1.) Very affordable2.) Very simple to use3.) Gets the job done quickly.Just put the (clean) bottles and parts in the little rack inside, use one of the clean bottles to measure about 7 oz. of water to put in the sterlizer and pop it in the microwave for 8 min. Easy peasy."
5,What would I do without this?,"This is a wonderful product. The best thing about it is, the different size and shaped bottles that you can put into it. About to have a newborn and experiencing ""nesting"", I have sterilized all his bottles in it. I registered for so many different types of bottles and have not had a problem with any of them fitting into this. This is an absoulte must for bottle-feeding moms!"
4,Great Product!,"We just had a new baby boy and I feel like a new mother! My older son is now 14 years old and boy have baby products changed since then! I seriously considered comments and reviews when deciding which items I wanted, which I could live without, and what was an absolute must have. So I hope you find my review just as helpful when deciding on your purchase. I couldn't be more pleased with this bottle sterilizer. It works quickly and it's so easy to use. I appreciate that the sterilizer doesnt take up much cupboard space and holds alot of bottles, nipples,pacifiers, etc. This product has not only made bottle cleaning easy but it also allows for a convenient place to store them. This is definitely one of our favorite purchases!"
3,Too short for Dr. Brown's standard 8 oz bottles.,"About 3/4"" inch too short. Lid won't close, even if it did, the upside-down mouth of the bottom would be submerged under the boiling water, not above the waterline as with any other 8oz bottle. Can place diagonally, but then can only fit 3, instead of 6.Just not tall enough."
5,Microwave Steam Sterilizer,"This is great! We did not want to put our daughters bottles in the dishwasher with everything else, so we started looking for a sterilizer and someone told me to try this one. It works great. You can even use it for breast pump parts."
3,Just be careful...,"Be aware that we used the recommended 7 ounces of water while sterilizing two 8 oz Dr. Brown bottles for the instructed 8 minutes. Upon removal of the sterilizer from the microwave we noticed that the steam had warped the bottles into themselves almost caving them in. Also, we noticed that the neck of the bottle had began to bubble indicating it was about to set fire. I am sending the bottles back to Dr. Brown but please be aware because we did everything the instructions say to and had we not been so attentive, it may have sent fire."
4,Family & Frendship Transcends,"This movie was wonderful. An early intro to Hill Harper who has gone on to star in movies such as The Skulls and hits like CSI:NY. I digress, this movie presents a wonderful journey of one young man to find his roots and honor is mother's dying wishes. In the process, he finds himself and others are forced to take a journey within as well. Add to that the backdrop of the lovely Irish landscape (and a haircut scene that is one of the most tastefully sexy things I've ever seen) and you've got yourself a treat for a lazy Sunday afternoon."
3,Not what I expected,"I went back and forth on this one. Bought it to learn how to make a Flat Pattern. Half of this book is on construction of each basic pattern (blouse, skirt, pants etc) with minimal variations. Lots of large drawings, very little text. Not for the person who already knows construction techniques. If I were a beginner in sewing I would need more information on construction than this gives. But good instruction on Flat Pattern making if you want to not use half of the book...."
1,"They're NOT the original TV soundtracks, folks!","This collection does not have any original soundtracks in it. Instead, it is a collection of reinterpreted theme songs all performed by a group of studio musicians. Some of the interpretations are pretty good, and some are not. If I had to evaluate it on its own merits, I would say this CD is okay. However, I was looking for original tracks, and this CD doesn't come close (especially for ""Miami Vice"" and ""NYPD Blue""). If you're looking for the original tracks, stay away from this one!"
3,Not Original but Good,"The original recordings of these tracks, most of which are instrumentals, are almost impossible to find. I normally do not purchase re-recordings by the original artists or those made by others. I keep waiting eagerly for Mike Post to put out a collection of his original recordings of some of TV's best theme songs. In the meantime, this is pretty good listening and at a bargain price."
4,"""Different"" at first","While it was intially very difficult for me to adjust to Nadine's voice (it is high and lacks the ability to soothe one's ears), this CD grew on me and is now a part of regular playlist. I really wish that Nadien would ""soften"" her voice as she has done in some of her earlier singing."
3,an Apocalypse?,"I have just completed reading Father Elijah and I find myself among a minority. Although I think the book is well written and has a very good plot, I do not feel the book is as good as it is acclaimed to be. Many times I found myself reading about Faith that is described in perfect theological accuracy, but with something missing. For example, conversations like most of the ones contained in the book don't happen. And, for Father Elijah to be the spiritual force that he is yet not recognize an angel who has been sent to assist him, I find hard to accept. This book is a long one, and its ending leaves you with no conclusion. However, I am sure God is using this book as a tool to reach many, to teach some who might have never known."
3,"okay, but overly-hyped","The pace was somewhat slow at times, and engaged in dialogue that was too verbose and over my head. The overall premise is intriguing but much of the characterization which O'Brien took such great care in when first introducing characters, was pointless as he would suddenly end character's roles without so much as a hoot. If this is waht he considers suspense or thriller, then he should check out A Game of Thrones. The reader never understands the effect of Father Elijah on the AntiChrist (the President) and the story culminates in a vague and dreary descent upon Jerusalem. I thought the last part where they are about to enter the Holy City should have been fleshed out. A disappointment."
4,Sound theology...,"Beyond knowing that it was an apocalyptic novel, I didn't know what to expect with this book. Overall, I was pleased to see sound Catholic theology presented throughout. As the author mentions in the introduction, it's not a super-fast paced adventure. I did find myself intrigued by the events and it was not painful to continue reading to see how things ended.I enjoyed the scenes around Rome and Assisi and the Catholic references and nuances. I also appreciated how O'Brien accurately alludes to real problems the Church faces today and how he uses Christ as the antidote.I had difficulty with getting lost in the dialogue of the characters, as it was difficult to keep track of who was speaking at times. Knowing that this was an early book of O'Brien, it seems natural that some of the description and flow of the writing was a bit rough.Otherwise, I found it to be a fine read."
4,Much like a Dean Koontz book,"Wait, hear me out. Koontz suffers from writing fascinating and delightful stories that have a hard time being wrapped up in a tidy package at the end. I found that the case here. I tore through this book in no time, but the end left me a little empty. Definitely worth a read. Very insightful and entertaining. I look forward to reading the rest in the series."
3,Very well written and an exciting story to follow,"I enjoyed this book thoroughly and was saddened when it ended. It was a rollicking ride through the rise of the antichrist as seen through the eyes of the Catholic Church and a monk named Fr. Elijah. The characters are well explored, and the story is well thought out with plenty of twists and plots to keep you hooked. The only disappointment that I had with the book is that the story does not adapt well into a series. It seems that I only began to get to know the character, and he seems to fade into other stories in the end times in future volumes. I wish the author would continue evoloving the story around the main character, Fr. Elijah, a kind, brilliant priest going head to head with the antichrist."
5,A modern Dostoevsky,"This book is amazing! I am very fond of russian literature (Dostoevsky _in primis_) and have never read ""thriller"" novels because it is a genre that does not interest me. But ""Father Elijah"" is something different. It tries to go to the same depth as Dostoevsky's ""Brothers Karamazov"" (in fact the scene where the main character kisses the count recalls Christ kissing the Great Inquisitor), and in my opinion it succeeds. This is a fascinating tale that pushes you to investigate the reality with deeper eyes and to look at the true essence of the things and the people around you.It is interesting to note that the Pope described in the novel has many similarities with Benedict XVI (he is an important theologian, more-than-75 years old) despite the fact that the novel was written more than ten years ago.Definitely recommended!"
5,Updating Buffett Collection!,"I purchased this CD to update my current BUFFETT collection. I've played my ORIGINAL cassette tape so much, it was beyond use!"
3,gift,"I bought this CD as a gift for my daughter. I haven't heard it and I'm not a Buffett fan, but my daughter likes the CD."
2,Not One of JB's Best,"I consider myself to be one of Jimmy Buffett's best fans. I own almost all of his albums and have seen Jimmy and his CRB in concert roughly 10 times. The concert I enjoyed most was a two man outdoor show (just Jimmy and ""Fingers"") in Melbourne, Florida at Florida Institute of Technology. This show took place in 1984 or 1985, about the same time that Riddles in the Sand was released. It was a good year for concerts, but not the best year for new music. In my opinion, Riddles is not one of JB's best albums."
2,This One's A Mystery,"Riddles In The Sand is not one of Jimmy Buffett's best efforts. ""Ragtop Day"" is great song and conveys the sense of fun that Mr. Buffett is best known for, but the rest of the album seems forced. Even song titles like ""Knees On My Heart"" ""She's Going Out Of My Mind"" & ""When The Wild Life Betrayed Me"" sound like he trying to hard to be witty. ""Come To The Moon"" isn't half bad, but ""Who's The Blonde Stranger"", ""Love In Decline"", ""Burn That Bridge"" & the rest are not up to Mr. Buffett's high standards."
5,RIDDLES (Buffett) Review,This will be one of my favorite Buffett albums...! I'm a sucker for good story songs.
5,Great CD,"I have been looking for this CD everywhere, but could never find it anywhere. It was still in its wrapping when I got it and it plays pefectly! I love it!"
4,"A ""MUST HAVE"" in everyones collection","I must confess "" I am a parrothead "". For those who aren't aware, Parrotheads are religiously loyal and devote Jimmy Buffett fans, so my review maybe a bit biased. I definetly recommend all of Jimmys work but some albums stick out a little more than others. This is one of his earlier ones for me. I can't really explain why I just know I get excited when I come across it in my CD collection."
5,Absolutley Amaing,Bettina Rheims is an extraordinary photographer i was fortunate enough to have worked with her.She evokes someting from you that you never knew was even there.It amazing to have worked with such an artist.
4,Identify dragonfly pictures,"I love to photograph insects, and obviously dragonflies and damselflies are common subjects. Identifying them, however, was often a problem. Using this beautifully illustrated book has been a big help in this regard. Obviously, there's more there too, but this contains more species than most and the compact size appeals as well."
1,Don't get it,"1. The Max size does not have a corresponding Max wet mop cloth size. You have to use two of the regular size, which means the cost adds up. Also the two cloths just don't work well. Very wasteful.2. You cannot control what chemicals you are using. This is a big deal to me for health and environmental reasons.There used to be similar product with reusable velcro attached cloths. You could toss them in the laundry when they got dirty. I just can't find it out there."
5,swiffer cloths,Very hard to find the extra large swiffer cloths in our area and am very pleased to have found them - they are the original stuff!
3,Works as expected,Works as expected. Larger than regular Swiffer so covers our house faster. Only used wet refills (2 at a time) w/ it so far.
1,Amazon has no clue of shipping dates,"Amazon said this item would be shipped in 1 to 2 weeks. Nowthe website says it is out of stock, but I never received anynotice what so ever. Very poor customer service."
5,Track Listing,Track Listings1. Come And Enter His Presence2. Anything That Costs Me Nothing3. With One Voice4. My Redeemer Is Faithful And True5. Time6. A Brand New Day7. Waiting To Be Wanted8. Come Worship The King9. Bittersweet10. Take My Life And Let It Be
2,Disappointed Angel,The quality of this costume was not what we expected. It was made very cheaply. My 9 year old daughter would not even wear it for Halloween.
1,Terrible odor,"On opening, I noticed an extremely strong odor and put this costume in the washer right away. After two times through the wash cycle, I threw the overlay (with feathered arms) away - the smell seemed to have gotten stronger! - and at that point, it wasn't worth returning for the money spent. The long white dress did not smell as bad as the overlay after washing, but that's not saying much. It still smells terrible after sitting for several days and is not wearable. The wings and halo seem OK, but we haven't actually taken them out of the packaging.In the end, we got a silver fabric belt, a cheap tinsel halo and flimsy wings. If you purchase this item, direct contact with any other part of the costume is not recommended. It's cheaply made, overtreated and poorly constructed - and not even close to the quality in the photo shown. I think I bought it for under $15, but recommend that you don't spend your money!"
3,Angel Costume,"The costume was ordered for a school Christmas play. It is shear and the top of her underwear and pantyhose showed through. When I put the belt on, the tops were covered. Other than that, the costume was fine."
1,Got this for a friend's daughter,"My friend had me order this for her daughter. She hated it, the wing ripped right away and some of the fringe came loose. She was not a happy camper."
4,Snow Angel Costume,The feathers on the sleeves made this costume stand out more than the other ones found anywhere else. It looked beautiful. The prize was perfect.
2,halloween costume,"This was very cheaply made and the wings broke before they even went trick or treating...I ended up going to Clares and buying different wings which cost as much as the original costume...Save money,idid not!"
4,Perfect Angel Costume,It perfectly fits on my sister. Shipment and arrival of the product was on time and with no hassle. Good Product!
2,"Poor quality, runs small","I bought this for my 9 year old daughter for our church's Christmas pageant. She wears a size 10 so I ordered the Medium. It is way to short for a medium. Now it's unavailable so it looks like I can't exchange it - I'm stuck with it. We'll just use the wings and halo. The wings are already coming apart and she's only worn them around the house. I'll have to hot glue part of them back together to use for the pageant. Plus, the elastic is too big, so they don't stay on well. The halo had one thin row of tinsel so I had to buy some more to add to it to make it fuller. The long sleeve netting part of the costume is very cheap and I think it would be itchy if I put it on my daughter. I definitely don't recommend this costume. If you order it anyway, at least make sure you order the next size up."
5,BEAUTIFUL COSTUME,I bought this for my six-year-old greanddaughter and she absolutely loved it and looked beautiful. The service was super fast and I could not have asked for more.
1,very disapointed,the costume was great but it had a horrible smell that I spent $2o.oo in products to try and get rid of and still couldn't
1,Just look at the help menu!!!,It is a complete disappointment. A strategy guide should offer more than to where to point and click. The worst is that you have to pay for it as well. The whole idea is like buing a book where the manual of your CD is reproduced. I would suggest amazon should take it off list!!!
3,The hell was the author thinking,"This book was a rip-off for its price. It looks like he just printed the help file that comes with StarEdit. If you want to spend money, you should use it on something else."
3,Great historical record,"Don't let the nightmarish introduction, with William Powell as Zeigfeld in ""Heaven"", getting the juices going again to run a show from...on high. Many supposed ""classics"" from that golden era - yes, ""1939"" is considered the year that Hollywood ""crested"", if you will - have these moments whch incite the present day viewer to either grab the remote-mute and cover his/her eyes at the same time. (I still have not mastered that!).Great to see ""1939"" colour and many, many stars at their fightin' weight - the format is a primordial video collection - the best stuff involves dancing, especially the Astaire sequences, one including Gene Kelly, a real rare moment for the fan-historian.So we have a 1907 approach to 1939 in 2011! Where was Abbott and Costello? To me, one of the few acts to arrive in these times, with next to no dating.(Can someone tell me where was Elise Cavanna?)."
4,Pleased with this film,"MGM give Arther Freed and Vincent Minelli a 3 million dollar budget and their biggest stars to make this film ~ a film without a plot. Instead it is like a variety show of musical numbers and comedy skits. If you are a Fred Astaire fan, he dances three numbers in this movie. One number is with Gene Kelly, the only time they appear on film together. Also appearing are Judy Garland, William Powell (recreating his role as Zeigfield), Lena Horn, Red Skeleton, Kathern Greyson, Keenan Wynn, and many more."
4,VG DVD presentation,Warner HV has done an excellent job with this DVD. For some reason the audio outakes do not include Avon Long's vocal for LIZA. Although you can hear it on the Rhino soundtrack CD. Also the extensive still file included with the laser disc set is not on the DVD. The old special edition laser disc set was more comprehensive than this DVD. Sound and picture are both excellent. Recommended.
1,Rust Rust Rust,"I purchased this item and found it to be not worth the money I spent even though they were cheap and as the saying goes you get what you pay for. The only way this item would not rust is you only hand tighten them and we know we can't do that with lug nuts,the slighest metal on metal contact of this product starts the rusting process, now I have to replace all 10 lug nuts because of this rusting issue. amazon needs to drop this product and do a better job at vetting products they sale on their website."
3,Nice fragrance.,The fragrance is great it just does not last long. After a few hours didn't smell it at all. Will not purchase again. Very disappointed because I bought this fragrance (actually I bought two) after reading the positive feed back.
5,Buy this CD! It rules!,This song kicks! If your lookin' for a good CD and a great singer then this is the song for you.
3,I will survive,$21.00 for two songs. A RIP OFF. Amazone should be screening their vendors. My future orders will not be going to Amazone.W. Kleczek
1,I'll Choose My Own,"I am a woman and I will choose my own ""best"" song, and it won't be this one, thank you very much.I cannot even begin to describe how much I despise this song. It is drenched with cliches, horridly sung, poorly produced, and has absolutely nothing going for it. There are plenty of songs that we women can adopt as our anthems. This is not one of them."
1,Flesh Crawlingly Bad,"One of the worst songs from one of popular music's most embarrassing eras, this junk should be banished from the airwaves as punishment for all the misery it caused. Synthetically produced, and poorly sung, it is one of the lamest cliches of the horrid disco era. For the love of God, avoid."
4,Great song but...,"I have to sorta agree with hankaaron. Don't get me wrong I listen to this song at least 3 times a week. The words are very meaningful and emotional! Flame on Gloria!But, from a musical stand point it is a boring song. First off, the song has no chorus. It follows a simple circle of 5ths chord progression until it hits a B diminished chord instead of the B-flat so it can jump to E major then back to the home key of A minor....then the same sequence is repeated for an additional 8 minutes. There is no breakdown into other keys. It wouldn't have hurt for it to play around in the relative major key of C for a few bars, then return back to A minor.The strings and horns add musical color to the repetition. And Gloria's voice and the meaning of the words ensured it's success.But, not all people listen to music for the value of the words, or the beat. Some people are not tone deaf and expect good musical creativity from artists in addition to great lyrics."
1,Possibly the worst song ever,"This is possibly the worst song ever. Certinaly the worst song of the 70's, and that is really saying something."
1,What the?,The best song for women? That's a pretty ironic statement given that this song was written by two MEN and was propelled to its inexplicable popularity due to its baffling appeal to gay men. Forget this one.
1,The Anti-Christ of Music,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible Dreck. I have hated this song every since it came out. This is the worst ideal of what music should be. For those of you that like this song, try this. Divorce yourself from the past emotions that you have had for this song, and play the song again. Don't hum or singalong, just listen. Listen to horns, try to detect a bass line or a melody. You'll find that it sounds like a very bad broadway musical number. As for the songs popularity, it's the greatest mystery since Easter Island."
5,When Music Really Did Survive...,"Although I am an 80s child born in the late 70s, I think this is one of the best songs I've heard. For any woman who knows what it's like to be put down or walked on by someone (which is all of us), this is the perfect song for you. It tells the story of a woman who's had enough and she's not going to take it anymore. She's moving on and she's ready to show the world what she's made of. A true, innovative ""girl power"" song."
3,Not for an 80GB Zune,"It's a very nice product for the price. The 80GB Zune does fit into the case, but there's room for movement on either end. Also, the buttons do not line up well with their slots making it difficult to operate.I did contact JR Computer World's customer service before purchasing to ask if the case was compatible with an 80GB Zune. Their response, two days later, ""the specs. are on the web site."" No freakin' duh! The specs. do not state what Zune player the case will specifically fit. I took my chances and ordered it, and now I'm sending it back.If you're looking to purchase a case for a 30GB Zune, then this is a GREAT case at a great price. Comes with a built-in screen protector and belt clip. If you're looking for a case for a 80GB Zune, then you might want to pass."
1,read the description,"My fault- I overlooked the description when I purchased it (I had been shopping a few)... BUT unlike the photo of the pegboard, it does not include the pegs. Yes, it was my mistake, but as a busy mom shopping online it's easy to make the mistake when the picture is misleading."
1,Does not exist,I tried to order this cd and the japanese ep but after three months amazon cancelled saying they could'nt get the cd. This single DOES NOT EXIST!
4,Indispensable,"This index is indispensable for the Egyptologist, but of no use to the layman. It is an index of titles in alphabetical order from the Old Kingdom, with lists of holders and references for each entry. Each entry also includes the hieroglyphs, transliteration and translation into English. Some entries also provide translations in other languages by various scholars.It is not comprehensive in terms of references or holders (how can it be when new discoveries are being made daily?), but is excellent for looking up a title.Unfortunately, there is no index of types of titles - if you are looking for all titles connected with fishing, for example, you have to look through every page.This is an update of Murray's Index.Terrific for the professional Egyptologist!"
3,Good not great,"Can be used with dry or wet hair, but it's my first pass with my daughter and then I add Twig's leave-in conditioner. It doesn't seem to make the hair greasy or sticky when used when the hair is dry."
2,Have to use a lot to make a difference,"I bought this for my 2-year old daughter's tangled hair, and was a bit disappointed with the product. We had to spray quite a lot to get the tangles out. She has longer, straight hair that sometimes got knotted after bath. I felt like I had to spray quite a bit to make a difference. If you're going to spend money on a detangling product, I'd suggest getting the CA baby conditioner and bypassing the detangling spray. The conditioner I found to be more effective than the spray."
2,"Great smell, doesn't work very well","We love the way this smells, and I love that it's natural. Sadly it doesn't work very well. I won't buy it again."
4,good detangler,"When I first bought this product, I wasn't a fan and to be honest, I hated the smell. However, the smell has grown on me and now I even use it on my hair because it really does work and it is the only thing that doesn't leave an oily residue. You do have to spray it on generously."
2,Forest Replays,There are six scenes. In each a stationary camera captures Sun's rays penetrating the forest. Footage for each scene is less then a minute long but is repeated about fifteen times or so. Theme music can be considered meditative.This DVD will likely not appeal to nature lovers. It gets two stars for possible use as a meditation tool.
1,"Real-Time, Still Camera","In each of the few scenes, the camera never moves at all, so you just, for example, watch sunlight in real-time pass by a great tree for 10 minutes, then for the next 10, watch rain fall on tall grass field, all with a still camera which never ever pan around or zoom out or move in any way. Sigh."
4,The Shot Heard Round The World,I had the good fortune to talk at length with the book's author. I asked him why people wanted to read about Milan. He said Milan was the ultamite underdog. He drove to each of the players' homes and interviewed each of them for a day. As good as the movie? No...but you'll hear the players themselves speak.
1,The Greatest Basketball Story Ever Told,"First, just to set the records straight - Milan wasn't the underdogs that the movie ""Hoosiers"" made them out to be. They should have won the State Championship in 1953, but they were overconfident (they lost in the championship game).The book is very disappointing. It's a very dry history of the team. It's not poorly written, but it's not as exciting as I had hoped. I would suggest only getting it as an addition to a collection of other Indiana High School books.I grew up with this story and would recommend ""A Boy, A Ball, and A Dream: The Marvin Wood Story"" Marvin Wood was the coach of the '54 Milan Indians."
2,Where's the tension?,"If you're a basketball fan, you gotta love the concept of the '54 Milan team; underdogs take all in THE high school basketball tourny. But this book is hard to read; I had to fight to make it through the repetitious phrasing and metaphors. And the organization is a bit odd. First an overview, then the '53 season, then the '54 season, followed by biographical chapters for each of the players. You would've though the bio chapters would come first.....at least it would do a lot more for the flow of the book. Recommended only for the most die-hard HS basketball historians."
5,I'd Dock in this Harbour,"A great Jimmy Buffett album. Over half the tracks on this album are among my all time favorite Buffett songs, this album really delievers. This is definately a CD you can listen to over and over again and will please more then just Parrot Heads."
4,Better than expected,"This is actually a pretty decent cd, better than I was expecting. The first three songs are very weak and probably not the best way to start a cd. It picks up, though, after the third song and carries forward. The title track is excellent and well worth the money by itself. Honey Do is vintage Buffett with funny lyrics and catchy music. I went into it hoping to kill the curve, but I can't. I actually liked the cd. It's not a five-star because of the first few songs, but after Livin It Up, it really becaomes an excellent cd."
4,Ah Relief!,Ok this is my first massager and you know what I like it why didn't I get it sooner?! I actually got it for my husband because of the heat feature (heat pads are $$$$) but I tried it when I had one of my tension headaches in the back and shoulder area and WOW! in about 2 min it was gone! Its good for all those knots in my back. the only draw back is you can only run it for 15 min max or it may over heat.
3,Disappointing mix from Dave Seaman,"Dave Seaman has been consistently excellent for the past 3-5 years and all his Renaissance mixes and his first GU disc are superb. This disc comes as something of a disappointment after this. The first disc is quite good, it is good mix of laidback deep house with some good tracks and comes to a sensational close with Above and Breeder. The second disc is quite disappointing with some tracks which seem completely out of place like the Baguio track and the Way Out West track. The disc fails to establish consistent mood and is rather uninspired. Dave's beat mixing is good, as always but this is a disappointing effort from him. Check out his Renaissance America, Awakening and Buenos Aires mixes to hear him at his best."
5,Great for the price,"The flag is thin, I admit, but for my purposes is works fantastically. At less than five dollars including shipping, you can't beat the price either!"
5,The best part is the price,"The flag cost $5, including shipping/handling. The bear had red eyes (easily fixed with white-out) and there were two black spots on the flag, but for the cost, I can't complain."
1,"This is not a Banner, it's a flag with grommets.","This is not a Banner (with a sleeve), it's a flag with grommets. Too many flags are listed as banners."
4,You get what you pay for,"A nice size, and good detailing on the bear. However, mine did arrive with two small spots; one brown stain in the grass area, and a splotch of white also. Small enough to not really catch your attention, but mistakes nonetheless. Perhaps I just had bad luck and happened to get a faulty flag. Without these however, the flag is definately worth the price. What more can you ask for for $2.79?"
2,Stains,"Yeah yeah, I should've expected bad things from such a cheap flag, but not anything quite like this. There are 3 very noticeable stains on the flag. One is at least an inch in diameter and bleached the U in Republic. I would send it back, but it would probably cost more to ship it than I bought the flag for.I am a college student, and this residence is impermanent, so it works fine for my purposes. However, if I actually wanted to decorate something with pride, I'd be more annoyed."
3,Cheap,"The flag is really cheap and it came to me with the ends kind of frayed. It's really big, which is cool, but I think I'll try to buy one that's a little bit higher quality."
5,Great Flag!,I purchased this flag for a French friend of mine and she loved it! The material is great for what you're paying.
5,Its a flag,"No the best or the worst flag I'v seen but for the price I cannot complain, Is just what I expected maybe a little bit more."
3,Father Ted,"Father Ted is enjoyable but not as much fun as other British comedy. I prefer ""Doc Martin"" or ""Are You Being Served."""
2,"""Pajama Girl Case"" Italian Giallo Review...","I haven't seen this flick yet but a cousin of mine has. This is his short review: As a die hard giallo fan, i have been greatful to see movies of the genre beginning with Mario Bava to Argento more contemporary giallos. This is why i was excited to find out that Blue Underground recently released four new giallos. In short i have been pleased with three of the movies but one, the Pajama Case. It's starts off good but quickly fades into an unsuspensful drama. Even though there is good, charasmatic actors there is no violent deaths of any kind that i have become accustomed to. This movie is only for the true die-hard giallo collector....."
2,Residue and Uneven Finish,"I used this on the interior of my car and was initially very pleased with it. It made my vinyl dashboard, etc. and leather seats look very good...at first. 24 hours after using the product, the finish has become uneven and there is a white residue developing. I will have to redo the entire interior of my car. In addition, though the product was excellent on surface dirt, it was worthless on any ground in dirt. Overall, I'm pretty dissatisfied and will probably try some 3M or another reliable, better-known product."
4,Product immediately cleaned light surface dirt but needed some work to get off more soiled areas.,Prodoct worked well on lightly soiled areas but needed some extra work to get out deeper soiled areas.
1,Totally ineffective,"I purchased a bottle of this product about a year ago and since then have tried it several times on car interiors, briefcases, shoes, chairs, etc. I followed the directions on the bottle meticulously and made sure the surfaces were leather or vinyl.This product is totally ineffective.It did not even partially remove even the most insignificant stain, and did not appear to ""restore"" the finish of any surface. I can't recall ever trying a cleaning/restoring product that was so ineffective.Don't mean to be so blunt and negative, but if it had worked even half as well as a normal person would expect, I would have been satisfied. Don't bother with this product. Try something, anything, else."
5,One of best live John martyn cd s,"As a John Martyn freak of many years, i can easy say this is one of the best if not the best live cd from Mr martyn. With people like Dave Gilmore guesting, etc,etc."
5,"for what it claims to be, the best around","This is a great short book for reviewing the intricate grammar of Arabic after being taught it. It has no exercises or reading passages, though, so is no replacement for a textbook, let a lone a teacher. For what it claims to be, it is the best I've seen."
2,Good for historical Purposes and not much else.,"This is primarily a sentence by sentence breakdown of the I Ching by Wang Bi. For oracular purposes, it is essentially useless. Wang Bi was primarily interested in the movement and placement of the yin/yang lines that create a hexagram. Now, for some, that is the purpose of the I Ching, and you can understand the meaning of the individual hexagrams [gua] by nothing more than this. Having many translations of the I Ching, I find the book to be dry, and without any real oracular use. It does not ""speak"" to the question, which puts it in the same class as the very heavy and largely useless ""Original I Ching"" by Ritsema, et.al., which is nothing much more than an I Ching ""concordance and thesaurus."" For scholars, it has its uses, and yes, I do own it. But I would never turn to it to answer a real question of any kind."
1,Don't bother,"This is a terrible book. The translation juxtaposes English words that are presumably equivalents of the original Chinese ideograms. The result is incomprehensible. The English words appear to flow in gramatically correct sentences but they make no sense. The translator appears to have no idea of what the I Ching is about or how it was used in Chinese culture. Unfortunately, I bought this book and wasted my money."
5,A great cd,This is the best Rancid cd out there today. It has the catchy feel of punk rock. If you like the Clash you'll love this album. It's way better than Joe Strummer.
2,The only thing more disappointing would be if I was impotent,"Don't let anybody trick you into thinking that this was a good CD. There are 5 or 6 good songs out of 22. The last three albums are all better. Some songs are complete torture to get through. Before this album, Rancid was my favorite band and I knew every word to every song, but not anymore. The firest three are great but only buy this if you have 12 bucks burning a hole in your pocket"
2,I dont understand,"I'm the only person I know who hates the newest Rancid cd. It just isnt cool at all to me. Don't get me wrong I absalutely love the older stuff but I just can not get myself into the ""new"" Rancid. But I did see them on the last tour and they still put on a good show. So buy the older rancid. Stay away from this newest one at ALL costs."
2,Gets better w/ listens but not good enough,"Disappointing after ""Wolves""! I was expecting a much more skillfull stylistic mix, but I found that Rancid can't keep a punk beat out of ANY of their songs; so their reggae and blues influences sound b-a-a-d. Tim has basically taken over the band and the vocals, and his voice is still irritating. All the guest appearances (the Specials, Hepcat, the Slackers & Skinnerbox, No Doubt, the Bosstones) do not help -- or even change -- the band's sound. They shout no matter what the song, and always tap out a fast rock beat. This basically ruins potentially great songs like ""Backslide"" and ""Life Won't Wait."" Oh, and BTW, there's no lyric sheet. So what the hell are they saying?? I can't tell. If you want to see a SERIOUS punk-reggae-ska blend without all this half-baked political aspirations and poorly written songs, listen to Sublime."
4,Sky Crane Hits these Fists,"Seven words pop into my brain when intaking a dose of Rancid's (almost) newest: Straight-Up Oldschool Swedish-Influenced Thrash-Core. Ignore the Fat-Wreck poseurs who would classify this gem as ""experimental."" There is no so-called ""reggae"" or ""ska"" to be found here... unless by ""reggae and ska"" you mean Anti-Cimex tinted punk rock. Rumor has it that the Berkeley boys were chatting one fateful autumn day with the legendary Saguin Fancy (of Doom, for all you poseurs). Saguin was, according to legend, telling ""the boys"" (at this point) that what he world needed was a full-on crust-core onslaught of monumental stature. And they weren't the type to back down from such a challenge! (Brett Reed was silently opposed, but as we all know, he fancies Pearl Jam and eats crumpets). So here we have it, a slab of thrash-revival mayhem. Who'd-a-thunk it?"
2,Another Dissapointed Rancid Fan,"I was a big fan of Rancid's previous two albums. I listened to them all the time. They were great albums for the summer. So this past summer I went out and bought Life Won't Wait thinking that would be my ""summer album"" for 1999. Big mistake. Rancid has completley changed. And I for one do not like their new sound. The only song that saves the album is Who Would've Thought."
5,"A Great album, fun from start to finish. Rocking","I love this cd so much, i like every song on it. Who would have thought, bloodclot and every other song on this album all rule. I listin to it all the time. This is my first rancid album, but i am definetly gonna by their others. Interesting song lyrics."
4,wow,"i tell you i never really like punk that much but i had a friend turn me on to these guys, aand they kick .... this to me is there best work. yeah maybe the hardcore fans dont like but hey you cant keep playing the same stuff over and over. you have explore and thats what they did here and it turned out great. got buy this one."
4,good stuff,"this was the first rancid cd that i bought, and it is still my favorite. this is definately a different sound than any of the previous rancid cd's but it is still good. this cd presents the racid punk with good 'ole ska mixed right in with it. the obvious influence of reggea superstar buju banton is evident in such songs as life wont wait and holigans give rancid time to explore their capabilities beyond the punk scene. with the help of victor ruggiero (slackers frontman) on the ska tunes this makes for an overall good album. a little off the wall and less edgy for rancid, but still a keeper."
4,"The ""Hooligans"" Are Making Waves Again...","Another great release from one of the mainstays of modern punk! Rancid's newest release, ""Life Won't Wait,"" is punk rock at its best with a funky mix of ska and rap-esque beats to add flavor. Featuring appearances by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones' Dicky Barrett, Buju Banton, and No Doubt's Eric Stefani (among others), Rancid delivers its trademark pulse-pounding baselines under an irresistible cover of groovin' horn sounds and memorable lyrics. This album has a little something for all of their fans--the spunky ""Hooligans"" showcases a decidedly ska bend, and ""Who Would've Thought"" and ""Corazon de Oro"" show the band's ""softer"" =) side, but there are still tracks like ""Crane Fist"" for the die-hard punk addicts. In short, if you're looking for another ""Let's Go,"" this is not it--but you might be pleasantly surprised at the ""new"" Rancid. I know I'll ""Journey to the End"" with them ANY DAY!!!"
1,trustworthy buying advice,"Ok, lets get started. I really enjoy punk music, because like many other people, I feel exhilirated by loud, powerful and fast guitar and bass playing. With the exception of leicester square and bloodclot, there is none of this on Life Won't Wait. it is packed full of wussy percussion instruments, stupid horns and most of the songs are very slow. If you like that kind of thing, then by all means buy, but if you are expecting anything exhilirating or powerful, look to one of their other albums."
2,Let's Stop And Think.,"First of all I would like to say that I love Rancid and own all of there cd's except for the one they did with NoFX. Anyways after hearing And Out Come The Wolves and then getting this I was upset. I couldn't understand it, and it still confuses me today.How could one of the best punk rock bands change there style to ska-reggae? Well I tried to like it, and yes it did grow on me. But for all of you people who say you're true Rancid fans and you loved this cd kind of makes me wonder. This is ska-reggae, and Rancid is usually punk-rock so in the end you either like punk rock and ska-reggae or you're going along with the crowd. For me this album is ok. The ska and reggae music that is on this album is awesome but I didn't buy this album to get SKA-REGGAE music, I wanted good punk-rock. This is my least favorite Rancid album. Get this cd either first or last....you may love it but if you do then don't call yourself a real Rancid fan because they really messed this one up!"
1,Did the Clash exist?,"Having listened to this album eager for SKA glory I came away dissapointed and disheartened. Obviously theese boys have not been outside their bedrooms for many a long year with only a handfull of Clash albums to sustain them. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but come on wholesale stealing is just not on. Buy Clash albums, your stereo will not accept anything less and will be your friend for life. Rancid, indeed."
2,"rancid rookies, look elsewhere","while rancid is without a doubt my favorite band, this CD lacks the nonstop head banging fun that most rancid CDs have. If your a fan of raggae, then you might find this CD to be the best of rancid. However if you love songs that stick in your head for months, such as ruby soho on out come the wolves, then you might look elsewhere. tracks 2 and 4 are great, but the other 20 songs, lets just say i fell asleep. i feel that lets go and out come the wolves are the 2 strongest rancid CDs, so if your looking for outstanding ska punk, you'll definately find it their"
1,What Happened?,This is by far Rancid's worst CD. There are no catchy baselines and the guitars are weak. All the music is slow. NOTHING IS FAST PACED and LOUD! It is painful to try and listen to the entire album through. Not what I expected from Rancid. I just hope their new release (in August) is better.
4,I'm sorry but this is brilliant....,"All I can say is ""Wow!"". Sure, it sounds like ""Sandinista!"", volume 2 -- but is that necessarily a bad thing? I remember hearing ""...and out come the wolves"" a few years ago and liking it, but also thinking ""Clash rip-off"" -- but now, after hearing this highly impressive, challenging, varied LP I'm still thinking ""Clash rip-off"", but also ""Amazing, heartfelt songwriting"", ""Lots of pure energy"" and the aforementioned ""Wow!"" What a band!"
5,Rancid's Best,"The songwriting and musicianship on this album is fantastic. Listen to a song like 'Hooligans' and you will know exactly what I am talking about. When this album came out, I remember hearing all of the comments about how it wasn't punk enough and it was too poppy or too much ska and reggae. Those of us who enjoy great sounding music understand that it is not about how ""punk"" it is, we know that it is all about great songs, and that is exactly what this album is, a batch of truly great songs."
5,3rd times a charm,"I bought this the day it came out on cassette in that cool flip top cardboard case, like a pack of smokes. Few years later I bought the orange see-thru double vinyl. And now I downloaded it and this album still sounds as fresh as the day I first heard it. This is Rancid's Sandinista album. Timeless music. They fell off the map for me after this album but this one is magic."
5,Best Rancid album by far,"First let me begin by saying, more Lars is a good thing. I enjoy songs where Tim's singing, but i dont necessarily enjoy Tim's singing. However, Tim's voice isn't irritating here and Lars' voice was perfectly casted for this album.You could consider this their least punk album, or one of their most punkish (IMO Rancid 2000 most hardcore)depending on how you see it. I consider to be one of their more hardcore albums. It has a grittiness and a fire that wasn't seen on their previous works, and this album was determined to make a statement. The best part of it is how they mix it up here, they dont jus let the album roll down one road until the end.Long list of Standouts: Bloodclot, Hoover Street, Life Won't Wait, New Dress, Hooligans, Crane Fist, Leicester Square, The Wolf, Lady Liberty, Something In The World Today, Who Would've Thought, Turntables"
5,rancid expands its musical horizons - a must-add!,"Think that Rancid is only a punk-rock band? The new CD includes familiar punk and ska, but mixes in sophisticated reggae, Jamaican dance-hall music, Stax-Volt influenced soul, and good old rock and roll! Should be as influential as the Beatles Sergeant Pepper."
3,more like 3 and a half,"probably the most polerizing rancid album.some love the radical leaps in style, others(mostly narrow minded punkers) hate it, somehow calling it a sell out(?).all that aside,its a good,while not great,record.it does get spotty in some places,and even a little boring at times,but the standout tracks really stand out.""bloodclot"" is heart pounding,while the anger in ""1998"" is quite evident.""who wouldve thought"" is probably the albums shining moment,with its beautifull dedication to someone(guess who).i actually enjoyed the ska/raggae numbers a bit more than the rockers,as they seemed fresh and exciting.id give this a 3 and a half cause its easily the rancid album youll put on from end to end the least.but essential to any rancid collection."
4,"This album isn't as good as past albums, but still rocks","Life Won't Wait was a great album with many kickin tracks, but it lacked some of the quality of previous Rancid albums such as Out come the Wolves which I would strongly recomend you buy instead."
3,This is punk?,"I never heard of Rancid before ""Life Won't Wait"", so I had nothing to compare this album to. All I know is that I put it on tape and returned the CD to the record store I bought it from. My favorite song on here was ""The Wolf"", which nobody else seems to pay much attention to. Most of the lyrics are political and hard to understand. It is sort of condescending in a way, since the listeners feel stupid when they don't know what Tim Armstrong is talking about. If you are a political radical and a reggae junkie, you will like this album."
3,WARNING!!! (ir's not like the old stuff),"k, well i got this and i was like yeah! a new rancid cd... but to tell the truth it's not that great. I was stuck on tracks like ""time bomb"" and ""ruby soho"". and now the closest thing to them is #3. So if ""LIFE WONT WAIT"" go and get ""and out come the wolves"" you wont regret it!"
3,"""Wolves"" fans beware","Frank from Vegas said it all - this CD just doesn't hold a candle to their previous effort. There's some okay songs, but only ""Who Would've Thought"" achieves the excellence of the tracks on ""Wolves"". Not only is the songwriting not as good/interesting, but the production takes a disturbing step down. For diehard Rancid fans only."
2,the idey gets to be the wet blanket,"the idey didnt like this one that much. I dont know man. I like rancid a whole lot. And o can appreciate that they want to expand and do whatever. But you know what. Youre a punk band. One of the best. I loved it when you just played down and dirty fast punk. The song bloodclot is a good example. Great song. I was rockin out. The new album has a lot of cool other stuff in it, but i dont listen to rancid to hear all that other stuff. I want punk rancid style. I hate to be the downer of the lot but i didnt like this one that much. Rancid is a great band but ill have to maybe play it some more. Oh well."
4,A great step foward!,"Life Won't Wait represents a significant step forward for Rancid, showing off their exceptional musical talents and breadth. I'm torn as to whether I like this disk or ""Wolves"" better -- both showed a signficant range of music not present in earlier efforts (or as OpIvy). My favorite cuts on the disk are ""New Dress,"" ""Coppers"" and ""Leicester Square"" but they are all good. A definite buy."
5,rancid breaks the boundaries of conventional punk rock,Rancids new album shows that even being in a punk rock band takes talent. The level of music on this album has increased way past any other albums by a punk rock band. This album shows that Rancid will follow in the footsteps of the great Operation Ivy by breaking musical boundaries and showing the world that punk rock will never die!!!
4,"Buy it, kids.","This CD is pretty damn cool, but there're a lot of really weird tracks. The best ones are Bloodclot, Black Lung, The Wolf, 1998, Turntable, and Something in the World Today. Everything else is kinda scary, but those 6 tracks make it all worth while (esp. 1998)."
5,only closed minded people bashed this album,"After owning the first three Rancid albums, I was completely blown away by ""Life Won't Wait"". I was schocked it was the same band. This album really shows off a completely different side to the band and shows what great musicianship they have. Fans criticized the band for abondoning their punk sound but it is still here but only branching out into the style of ska/reggae. Any band can't stay the same with the same sound, as Rancid showed in this album. ""Life Won't Wait"" and the albums following up to this one have more structured song writing and i can't praise them enough for the great music they write, from 1993 to 2001's Indesructable. A real Rancid fan would love this record even if ska/reggae isn't the style they are into. Ahh THANK YOU RANCID FOR MAKING GREAT MUSIC!.. and everyone who loves them too.. i hope to see all of you in the pit!"
4,Two great songs but...,"Why didn't Sony release this I drove all night Single CD before releasing the One Heart CD? If you're thinking about getting this CD, then do but if you want ALL of the songs from her new album, go and buy the One Heart CD instead. And that is one reason why I took off 1 star, I gave the rest of the stars for the two great songs on the single!"
4,A Beautiful Wedge of Giallo Eye Candy,"With Franco Nero as the lead and cinematography by the multiple Oscar-winning Vittorio Storaro you'd be a fool not to expect an extremely good looking film. And if you're a fan of murder mysteries--especially the Italian variety known as gialli--then you'll probably eat this one up. The story is pretty thin and it's not gore soaked like many others, but it's really thick with a somber, tense, shadow-filled atmosphere and it's well acted by the jaw droppingly handsome Nero, Rosella Falk and Sylvia Monti. The climax, which begins in a fantastic modern house and ends in an abandoned factory is, for once, well choreographed and exciting. Good score by Ennio Morricone and did I say it's gorgeous to look at? Well, it is."
4,Seems to work for my little chi,One of my little boys had very itchy skin which has improved with a food change and this salmon oil. Another little boy came into rescue with terrible skin problems which have not returned since started on this product. I gave it a 4 rather than 5 star rating bc the pumps never seem to work correctly - they leak and can be very messy. But this stuff has passed the taste test and seems to get the job done.
4,Interesting,"Ash battles for his forth badge and the orange Isle's Winner's Cup, but will he win the winner's cup?With a Champ that has never been beaten and that can control a Dragonite the odds are 2-1 for Ash Ketchum, Pokemon trainer to win Drake, the Winner's CUp holder."
4,Very Fast,"This is a great cardio video. She goes through teaching each dance segment. I recommend really learning each dance because when you do the entire hour of cardio she goes extremely fast. I have danced all my life. I am not a professional, but I am some what coordinated and this is very hard. I think it will just take lots of practice, but it is well worth it. I would recommend the mat workout too. It is difficult, but doable. Tracy suggests you do each video every day. That is 2 hours a day. I rotate the 2 videos daily so that I work out 60 minutes a day. That is what works for me."
2,Loved it until,I loved this DVD......really one of Tracy's best......until it stopped playing so I sent it back and got a new one which took a couple months.....I was happy...I was dancing....until it stopped playing......so I sent it back and got a new one which took a couple months. I was happy I was dancing.....until it stopped playing so I sent it back and got a new one which took a couple months......I think you get the picture.......
2,You're killin' me...,"As a big fan of Ms. Paltrow and after seeing her on Oprah with Tracy Anderson I thought I would try her videos. I ordered this video and the Mat workout video. I really like the Mat workout a lot. It's different from anything I've ever seen, and I'm already seeing results after a week. Then this video came in the mail.Pros: Great music, visuals, and I like that she does the routines from the front and back so you can follow along whatever way is good for you.Cons: I'm almost 43 years old and don't have the strongest back. Bouncing up and down for 45 minutes is not gonna happen, at least not right off the bat. I think this video is good for intermediate to advanced level women who have a dance background.Sorry Tracy, but until you create a low impact cardio dvd, I can't work out with you just yet."
2,a little fast,"The moves in this video took multiple repeats and reviews before I was able to pick up on the moves. Tracy moves quickly through the breakdowns and when put all together does little varieties not included in the breakdown. This is probably fine for someone who practices dance, but not recommended for someone trying to get a good work out in the first few views."
2,tracy anderson dance,DO NOT kid yourselves on this one! It's not meant for those that are not dance inclined! It took me a while to get the dance moves and it was a bit confusing to have to learn it from a movie perspective. Lots of fast foot work but the music was decent to dance to.
2,for more advanced,"I purchased both this and the mat workout. I returned this one because it was a little too advanced for me. I put in the dvd and was ready to go but first you have to learn all her dance moves before you can actually exercise. Also when you get to the part to actually workout, she does not talk. It is just music and her dancing the different moves so you need to know everything or keep watching to remember.Again not for me but if that is your style of exercise and you are a quick learner, go for it."
3,"hard for the ""uncordinated""",I can dance. However her instruction is necessary to get the moves down. I have had the DVD for a month and cannot do it yet. It is fun and after time I think I will love it.Just wanted to let others know- it is hard to learn and she does not give ques and verbalize them when she does the workout.
1,do it yourself,"You might as well just put on some great dance music and just dance anyway you want to whatever music you like and get a better workout. There is absolutely no ""instructions"" on any Tracy Anderson workout DVD's. If you like playing FOLLOW THE LEADER go for it. But if you want to learn the routines you are on your own. My experience with this type of workout is BEWARE because you can possibly hurt yourself."
1,Not for the masses,"While I can see the results of Gweneth and Madonna's time with Tracy and do not doubt her method will work, I feel I wasted my money.First on the cardio, it would take eons for a regular joe to learn the routine and there are no instructions ongoing during the workout on either the mat or the cardio. It seems as if she is really just doing her own thing and if you are a quick study you can get in the game, but it is too easy to get frustrated with her method and her music is not good and I wish I could get my money back."
3,Tracy Anderson Cardio review,"Tracy Anderson Cardio is a good cardio workout, but it is not for everyone. If you are looking for a quick cardio workout that you can just put in, do easily, and not have to think too much about what you are doing... this is not for you. While the moves are not highly complex, it does take a few practice runs before you have the moves down (and I am a dancer). However, if you have some coordination, and are willing to practice the moves a few days before you can actually get a good cardio workout in, then this is a fun way to get some cardio in your routine. Hope this info helps."
1,Tracy Anderson Dance Cardio Workout,"I thought this product was not useful. I would not purchase it if you are not an expert dancer or willing to put a lot of time into learning her dance moves. As with any workout I am sure it gets your heart rate up but because there are so many moves I became frustrated and put the dvd away out of sheer annoyance. I never put it back into the dvd player after that. I prefer a workout that has just a little bit of repetition so I can learn the steps in a fairly short amount of time, and actually get a work out on the first use."
2,Way too hard,"I have dance experience from when I was a child but that isn't enough for this DVD. The steps are too fast and they aren't repeated in succession so there is no chance to catch up. This is for advanced dancers, not the average exercise video enthusiast."
1,Worst ever!,"Please do not waste your money unless you have formal dance training. These are not workout tapes but a series of camera shots of Tracy Anderson jumping up and down. Truly she is a terrible instructor for workout tapes because she does not breakdown the moves or steps. In one segment she literally says not to worry if you can't follow along but just jump up and down...and in a few weeks you should be able to follow her moves. Impossible to catch on with no explanation, for the untrained person it looks like she is having muscular spasms. Trust me I have bought numerous workout tapes with excellent instructors unlike these!"
1,Disappointed,"I saw Ms. Anderson on a news morning show and was impressed by her, so I ordered her DVD. However, I was not impressed with the DVD. The title is misguiding -- ""Dance Cardio Workout"" I usually associate music with dance workouts, but there was no music."
1,TOO TOO difficult,Too Ego bound and difficult for most people Not impressed and can find so many other dvd's that really are a much better choice
2,Confusing,"The dance routines are so broken apart and were hard for me to learn. Even when I did get one down performing it didn't feel like I was accomplishing anything, just skipping around."
2,TOO complicated!...I think even an exercise buff will struggle!,"This method is WAY too complicated. Unless you are already fit and have had dance classes all your life (I quit dance @ age 11 and have always loved to dance by the way) then this will be a REAL challenge just to try to learn. I tried and tried and I couldn't compute how to do any of the moves. My BF's daughter couldn't either so I don't feel too bad because she is a little younger and is a dancer. SO!...as much as I wanted to love this I didn't. I would be interested in hiring a personal trainer who knows the Tracy Anderson Method though if there was such a thing in my area (which there isn't!). I think even someone who is an exercise buff would have problems getting these combinations. So, if you learn complex moves easily and are already an exercise buff then give it a try, otherwise I would try something else."
3,complicated,so i truly wasn't sure how to rate this bc if you can pick up things quickly it is a true cardio and would give it a 5 star but i'm not very coordinated..wish i was but this takes time. you really have to learn the moves. she goes over three dance moves and just learning one for me was complicated bc she moves very quickly once you have learned the steps. its truly like your dancing..not the average cardio classes. if i could get the moves down..wow it would be fun! what i do so i dont get frustrated is spend about 15 min going over the first dance move..this has been going on for a week. i still haven't learned the other two as im still struggling on the first. so enjoy if you want a dance challenge..but for the dancers out there already this should be a piece of cake for you. might not enjoy the repetition as that is what she does.
3,i am a fan of tracy anderson,I have been doing her work outs for over a year and I am very happy with the results. As far as this dvd goes in my opinion it was ok. It did take a while for me to learn the moves and I did get frustrated quite a bit. But it did not take me long and once I got it down it was easy.
2,Definitely not for a busy woman,"I already have Tracy's Mat Workout DVD and I am very happy with it. It's well put together and you can pick up the moves fast to make it effective for you from the very beginning.Quite contrary is the truth regarding her cardio workout. She goes first through 8 different series of movements which itself takes probably half an hour. There is lots of turns and fast transitions between the movements. In short, it's complex for someone who has never done aerobic dance. The DVD requires a lot of time to learn. I was just disappointed because I am a busy mom and for me to find an hour every day is not always easy. To spent few months learning the routine is not simply worth it for me. SO I am giving it only 2 stars."
2,Boring!,"The only good thing about this DVD is the music. I really wanted to like it, as I do a lot of Yoga and Pilates and I wanted to incorporate some dance moves in my workouts for fun, but I found it to be very boring and repetitious, in spite of finally learning the dance moves and being able to actually follow her and synchronize with her. You just jump around like an Easter Bunny to very upbeat music to get your heart rate up, something you can accomplish for free with a jumping rope.I gave up on this DVD as I got bored fast. I found that Cindy Crawford work-out DVD's , as old as they are, to be way more fun than Tracy's DVD's. I'm so mad I bought into all the hoopla surrounding Tracy Anderson and wasted my money on this DVD! And it is not cheap either!"
2,not unless you dance,I was excited to get these video's - I tried to follow the dance steps but it was very discouraging. Unless you dance I wouldn't buy this
3,Fun but hard to do...,"I was looking forward to this. In theory a great idea. In execution, not so. A class act, good trainer will consider her audience and do all that she can to help them. She is lazy when it comes to cuing. She just doesn't do it. Maybe she is just too cool for that? The tutorial is complex but at least she breaks it down. I tried doing it after only one viewing of the tutorial and didn't make it very far past the warm up. I am not one to give up, so I'll keep trying. The moves are kinda cool. It is rather jumpy so if you cannot tolerate impact aerobics then this is not for you. If you don't like to dance, then forget this one, too. If you do like to dance, have some background in it, then this should be a lot of fun for you."
2,Tracey Anderson Cardio Dance Routine,This exercise routine is not for those of us that are uncoordinated. It is not something you can just jump right into. It takes a while to learn the steps properly in order to benifit from the workout. I do not recommend this product unless you have a dance background.
2,Would not recommend if you don't have a dance background,Too complex and the actual workout is much too fast paced. Not enjoyable unless you really want to work at it.
1,Waste of Life,"Got this C/D because I heard how great Gweneth Pelthro said it was. If you could do actually do it, it wold be great but Tracy is a bad instructor and even worse motivator. Save your time and money. I wish I had the hour of my life back I wasted watching this C/D and the time it took to return it to CostCo."
1,Awful!,"Let me say, I am a former dancer with 12 years of experience. This DVD is so hard! The second one is even more difficult if that's possible! I would say you will probably be doing the instruction part of this DVD for MONTHS before you can complete the workout! I don't have that kind of time or patience. Sorry!"
2,Not for beginners and constant jumping and bouncing!!!!,"I am an active physically fit person. I also dance. I was a fitness trainer myself for years. I personally did not enjoy this workout. I wouldn't call it dancing either. You bounce and jump non stop the entire time, so not at all joint friendly!!! Yes if you put your all into it, and jump and bounce the entire time, I would say you probably are burning some calories. I got bored though, the same few moves for an entire song. Great for learning the moves and for some people constantly repeating the same thing over and over is great, but not for me."
2,Way to hard!,Not for the beginner! Way to fast when it's up to tempo. I believe this are for professional only. A little hard to follow. Moves are quite complicated.
3,its good,The video in itself is really good but I am used to workout videos like insanity so I felt that I wasn't working out as much.
2,If you're a dancer...and you have lots of space,Tracy is adorable..but you need a lot of SPACE to move around. The instructions are CONFUSING - near IMPOSSIBLE for us lay people to follow.I tried .. really .. I tried.I do recommend her Mat workouts. They will turn on the fat burning machine without compromising your space and flexability.
4,excellent,the product was delivered to me on time and most of all tracy anderson's mat method couldn't be better! I love it! after few weeks of excercising i already see awesome results. thanks a million tracy!
3,Must be very coordinated!!!,I'm sure the dance video will burn lots of calories if I ever get good enough at the moves to actually do the video. Each song has a different dance that goes with it which you need to learn in advance. I am finding it very difficult. Definitely NOT FOR BEGINNERS!!!!
5,She's really good!,"Dancing doesn't come naturally for me but I am working hard to learn the choreographies. I learned two so far and this is really a fun workout! Also, like her other two DVD's, this is not for beginners."
2,Hard to follow...,"I've taken aerobic classes, dance classes, kickboxing and so forth all my life, and loved every minute of it....This Dance Cardio DVD reminds me of routines we had to endure in cheerleading camps in high school. I find this somewhat hard to follow, and having to think too much when trying to keep up with all of the dance steps was a real turn off. I gave the DVD away to a friend and she didn't even attempt to finish watching it for the same reason. The DVD is now being passed around among all my friends and seems like no one wants it. Additionally, having to move my whole entire workout room to make space, and I still don't have enough to accomodate for some of the moves was very annoying. I guess I need a studio like Tracy.This would be great for a dancer who is familiar with step techniques, but not for the average folk like me who enjoys the good ol' fashioned, effective but simple routines without too many dance steps to memorize."
3,Overpromise,"Despite the choreography tutorial in beginning of tape, the lack of instruction during the intervals makes it very hard to follow and ultimately, hard to stick with. In a class the instructor reminds students what to do next like double knee right side. There is none of that here. It takes a lot of endurance to get through the intervals and you need ample room to move around, I like the matt video better and do it frequently while doing something else for cardio."
3,Too complicated for novice,I was really excited to try video after watching Oprah. I haven't been able to lose 15lbs after turning forty. None of my surefire tricks worked. So I thought I'd try something new. Unfortunately I am not nearly coordinated enough to do this workout. I also simply don't have enough room or the time needed to master it. I wish I would have purchased the mat workout instead!
3,The Tracy Anderson Method,"It was helpful to me as a new way of exercising. It is a bit advanced though. If you buy this DVD remember it will take a while to learn the dance routines, unless you are a professional dancer."
1,tracy Anderson Method Presents Dance Cardio Workout dvd,The first time I played on the 5th song the DVD froze and would not continue. There were no visible scratches or scuffs to be seen on said disk.
1,Wrong DVD in box,What was supposed to be the dance video was her pregnancy video and it was labeled incorrectly-so you didn't know until you played the dvd.
1,Don't Bother,It took less than 5 minutes for me to be convinced that this was not the exercise program for me. Anderson shoots out a long series of moves that only a professional dancer or a person with a photographic memory can follow. She does not explain how or why these moves help you. People who buy work out videos do so in order to get fit. They do not spend their money to memorize ill-instructed routines.
1,LAME,YOU DON'T WANT THIS INLESS YOU HAVE SOME DANCE EXPERIENCE THAN YOU CAN CATCH ON QUICK IF NOT IT WILL TAKE YOU A YEART TO LEARN
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!,"This is the worst work out DVD I have ever used, Tracy Anderson is a joke. Very unprofessional and full of fluff, anyone who endorses her is a liar. Take it from me do not buy this product, save yourself the disappointment!!!"
1,waste of money,I have Tracey Anderson's sculpting dvd's and I think they are great. I think the cardio was done poorly. The dance instruction is overwheming at the beginning. There are no prompts throughout the dvd. She just dances and wants you to follow along. Definitely a big waste of my time. Sorry Tracey we all don't dance like you.
2,not worth the money,"While this workout will definitely get your pulse rate up, I was looking for a straight forward, one hour, high impact aerobic workout that I could pop in the DVD player and then be done. As a busy mom of two toddlers, I just didn't have the time to learn each combination (there are 8)and then put it together in order to do the entire workout. While I realize that it makes the most sense to learn each combination gradually until one coordinates the moves, and getting up 2hrs earlier or going to bed 2 hours later is an option in order to accomplish this goal, I have so much more I need to do in addition to working out 1.5 hrs a day. I'm just not willing to invest that much more time in to learning dance combinations in order to actually feel like I had a good cardio workout. With that said, Tracy's mat DVD is great for toning and a much better investment than the dance cardio. I've been better off just going to a one hour kickboxing class at the gym.SL"
2,not her best dvd,i have a few of her dvd but with this one i didn't have much success...the routines are too complicated and hard to followi don't recommend this one unless you can easily learn more advanced moves...
1,Simply not good,"After attempting the workout, I was completely lost and discouraged. Maybe it's because I don't have a dance background but I can certainly remember steps. I should've just invested in an iPod and danced continously for an hour. Although Gwyneth and Madonna do train with her, I'm sure their work outs are customized and somewhat different from this. I'll stick to my Pilates."
4,A littel challenging,"I love to dance and would take dancing over a treadmill or elliptical machine any day, so this video is great in that respect. Only problem is that since I haven't taken formal dance classes in 20 years - it's a little challenging to learn the routines. You really do need to take it routine at a time and go from there. Really work on routine 1 (which goes with song #1) get that down and move on to routine #2 and so. You'll still get a good cardio workout trying to learn it one dance at a time - it's very reminiscent of dance class as a kid where each class you somehow got tired after doing the same 8 count for an hour. To me this video keeps my attention way more than going to the gym since it is something totally new and a challenge to learn and master the moves.Bottom line: If you have the need to be able to master a workout after 1 time of doing a video, don't even bother trying this one unless you were a dancer most of your life. Otherwise, give it a whirl and good luck."
2,I didn't like,"This video is hard to learn. She does break down the moves but when its at full tempo, there were transitional steps from certain moves that she added that got me confused. Anyway, I was dissappointed because of the difficulty. Once I learn the steps at tempo, I'm sure it will be better. I'm just not sure I will stick it out."
2,Sadly boring,"This cardio workout is unfortunately very boring. It's just an old school Jane Fonda's aerobic workout without - at least - that nice vintage feel. I can believe it's effective, but nothing new under the sun. The mat workout is definitely better."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking for a change for my winter workout routine and thought Tracy Cardio would be perfect, it would have but the problem i incurred was her dance cardio took too long to learn the routine in the meantime i had to use my other dvd's or treadmill in order to get my workout in. I think even if i practice everyday it would take quite a while to learn the complete workout. If someone is a dancer they may catch on quicker. It could just be me but i don't think anyone could purchase this dvd and start working out right away. Now if you have the time to put in maybe so."
2,So hard to follow but a great workout if you can learn it,"I bought all 3 of Tracy's videos and LOVE the other 2 but I almost never use this one because it's too hard to learn the steps for one song then fast forward to find it in the line up at regular speed for the work out. It would be better if it was set up with spacers in between so we could just hit search and find song 1, song 2, etc. If I could master the steps I am sure it would be a great work out but it's frustrating so I just flail and jump around trying to keep up."
1,very complicated,This video is very complicated. I would not recommend this unless you are a very experienced dancer. Tracey has no certifications or formal training which make her qualified as a fitness instructor. She makes many statements which are scientifically unfounded. Thumbs down!!
3,Difficult to follow,"This is a well produced dvd, and Tracy appears to have the right credentials and has apparently done a lot of research into the efficacy of her programme. However, the dances are very difficult for a beginner to follow, she says that if you do the programme 6 times a week as well as 6 times a week on the mat exercises you will see results. Any exercise programme that requires 12 hours work a week will have results surely!"
4,DEFINETELY HAS YOU SWEATING!,"I have absolutely no dance background/experience and I admit when I first watched this I thought there is no way I'll ever get the combinations down. But, after about my 4th time viewing I've gotten through the first 5 combinations. I just started off slow, spending each session with just one or two combos and repeating them until I reached my 40 minute goal. Then, the next time I'd add another combo. I'm just an average girl with not a lot of coordination and I can do this video. People who say it's too hard just don't have the patience that it takes to learn the steps. But, if you do and give it a shot you'll see it's a really great cardio workout that gets your heart rate up there and has you sweating like nothing else."
2,Just ok,"Denise Austin or Kathy Smith fans beware............I am a healhy 37 year old who exercises regularly to fitness videos and I find this video difficult. There are a lot of arm movements and holding your arms up which put a lot of stress on the shoulder and neck muscles. I find myself tense and sore and I eventually end up with a headache from the over-strain. I love music but I also find the choreography to be difficult to follow unless you have dance background. Also, there is no instruction or calling out of movements, it is basically trying to follow Tracy as she dances along in her studio."
2,"Loved mat workout, hated this one!","I first ordered the mat dvd and loved it so much that I ordered her post pregnancy dvd and this dance cardio dvd. I loved the other two dvds, but I really disliked the dance dvd. Unless you are trained in dance - well, I would not waste my money. It is crazy fast paced and no real instruction. I put the dvd in and literally could not do it. I do one or the other of her dvds 3 or 4 times per week and love them."
4,Great for Dancers,"I love Tracy Anderson Method Dance. I have no dance background, so its hard to learn the choreography. The work out is amazing. Its definately a keeper and will keep me busy learning for a long time. I need alot more room to do the workout. My living room is not large enough."
3,my review of the cardio dance dvd,well this is a good dvd if you are great at dance.iam a mother of a one year old and i dont have the time to learn all the steps(they are so many steps to learn).I also own the mat and post preg workout dvds. those are so great. my body has really changed since I started working out 3 monthes ago.my opinion is to find whatever cardio workout your good at or that you enjoy and pair it with the mat or post preg workout.also it can put alot of stress to your knees and ankles if you dont wear good shoes doing this workout.
5,"Fabulous workout, but difficult","I love this video. Yes, it's hard to learn the sequences. She breaks the video down into instructions vs. actual speed. I took another reviewers advice and just played one instructional sequence a week until I got it down. I changed a couple of moves because of my knees and there are times she deviates her arms from the routine, so I do my own. If you aren't coordinated this video will be too difficult. I'm not a professional dancer, but I love to line dance. I sweat more during this workout than running, treadmill or anything else I've done. I've had it for about 6 weeks and still don't know all the routines. I also bought the post pregnancy workout and saw results within a couple of days. It's hard work, but totally worth it! Take your time and don't get hung up doing every little thing perfectly."
2,way too difficult,"I love the mat workout so I was excited to try the dance dvd. I never got it too fast of pace, didn't feel like I got a workout at all. Stick to the mat workout its great."
2,if i could dance,"I love Tracy's style and philosophy on fitness and how a females body should look.I have her strength training tape also, and I love it. You know it will work for you if you make the commitment to do it 4-6 times a week.What I have to say about this dance cardio tape is I wish I could keep up, remember the movies. I am not a professional dancer yet I love to dance and do it often. I just find it VERY difficult to follow this tape. I really think you need to learn the movies in a studio from a live teacher and even then I would need a few classes before I would be able to flow threw it."
4,Tough!,This is a very tough workout. The portion where you learn the steps is very short and even going through it several times in a row I haven't gotten to the point where I can do it through at the correct speed. But it is fun and I'm sure when I do eventually get it down it will be a great workout!
2,Not For The Uncoordinated,If you are uncoordinated this is not the video for you. She does a good job of breaking the steps down but after several attempts I still can't get the hang of it. At this rate I'll never get to the actual workout.
1,Impossible to follow,I cannot comment on the effectiveness of this dance routine as it is simply impossible to follow them. Waste of money.
2,Don't believe the hype!,"this is so over-rated! Unless you are a trained dancer, this workout is impossible to follow. Even after the long instructional section, I found it extremely hard to keep up with."
1,Dont buy it!,"If you live in a dance studio and dream to be part of Chorus Line, well buy this DVD and good luck...otherwise, dont!Too hard to follow, need a lot of space to move, the combinations are hard to remember and dont expect a lot of explanations.Its for advanced dancers and still, i'm pretty sure they have some problems too.I'm very dissapointed and its too bad that i cant have a refund because i would ask for it!"
3,Tracy Anderson's Dance Workout,"This video is hard. It is one you cannot pick up in one session and ""get it."" You would need to practice a lot to learn all the moves. I've taken step aerobis for over 25 years so I didn't think I would have a problem following it...wrong! I think if she faced away from the camera, you could follow easier....that way you could watch and follow her foot movements. Don't get unless you have a lot of patience and time to learn."
2,"need lots of room, time, and smooth flooring","There are some great dance routines in this video that really get the heart pumping but unfortunately there are TOO MANY routines and they are pretty hard to learn quickly. You eventually can learn them in time, but the other disappointment is that you definitely need to have a lot of room in your house and a smooth floor (like a dancefloor or hardwood floors) to perform them on. In other words don't even try this on carpet."
2,Takes a long time to learn the dance routines,"I am a big fan of her mat DVD so, I was very excited to get the dance DVD to supplement. First, I was disappointed that the DVD I received did not work, but I returned it and ordered another. The second one actually skips a little so, the quality is not great. However, my major complaint is the difficulty in following her during the routines. You definitely need to have at least a little bit of a dance background. Also, it takes a long time and a lot of paying close attention to learn the routines. It helps if you have a large open space in front of your TV/DVD player because she moves around a lot. In the end, I will probably return it as it is just not conducive to a home workout."
1,Not Recommeded,"I would not recommend this video. The steps are difficult to learn. There are only three dances on the video. Tracy is doing the steps on a wood dance floor, but at home the moves are difficult to execute on carpet. The video format and music are frankly boring..."
3,Great Video - not great for apartment dwellers,This is a great video but requires a lot of jumping. Not a great activity for those living in an apartment where the jumping could potentially irritate or upset your downstairs neighbors.
1,ridiculous,"Any professional who recommends a woman should not lift a weight more than 3 pounds is a completeidiot. If you interested in looking skinny fat without lean muscle, go for it."
4,bef,"graet dvd people after a month of doing this workout 2 to 3 times a week were asking me why i looked so great and what i had been doing. just imagine what i would look like i could fit this in 4 to 5 times a week, im sticking with it and looking for future workouts from Ms. TA"
2,If your not a professional dancer - BEWARE!,"If I could actually do this video it would be a lot of fun and a great workout. . . however, without an insane amount of practice (and there may not be enough practice time in the world for me to ever actually get all of these routines down) as well as much much more space in my living room I'm thinking this workout will not help me in anyway. I love the mat workout, but Tracy Anderson wants you to do both in combination for the results she promises and recommends no other routines. So now I'm not really sure what to do. If you can dance go for this. If you think you can dance, MAYBE, in time, you'll figure this out. If you can admit to no coordination just don't even consider this video."
2,HARD WORK,"I can see that this would be a great workout, if you have enough time to sit through the tutes and actually learn this. I suspect it would take quite a while to learn each routine and then be able to do it to the soundtrack. I work for myself and work around 11 hours a day 6 days a week so usually just run about 6km, but wanted something w/ a bit of change in it so ordered this. I've ended up going back to Elle Mac THE BODY workout dvd in addition to running as this just takes TOO long to work out how to do, properly. I don't regret buying it but do feel like I need a good week of holidays to learn the steps properly and at this stage I don't have an extra 1 hr a day just to learn the steps, let alone do the workout.Buy if you're a good dancer OR if you have a lot of time on your hands to work out how to do this."
2,Big Disappointment,"I was really excited to recieve this video, but it really falls short. I danced my entire life and still found this to be hard to follow. The way the video is set up is there's an instructional section that runs through the eight combinations. She does this without ever doing any of the combos to music (which for me actually cements the routine). Once she runs through the combo (once slow, once up to speed facing forward and once up to speed facing backward) she moves on to the next one. She does this eight times in a row. By the third combo, I have NO idea what the first two were, let alone the five to come. From here, you go straight to the cardio dance, wherein she says NOTHING, except for 5-6-7-8 at the begining. She doesn't talk at all through the routine, including to tell you which combo you're actually on. This is a big disappointment."
1,Watch Out for the No Return Once Opened Policy!,"This Tracy Anderson Method Dance Cardio Workout DVD was horrible, something that a cheerleader could have put together and just as annoying. There is nothing fun about it and the music is awful. Beware when ordering it right from the company website. You are stuck with anything you buy once you open it, and of course that is not posted anywhere to warn you."
4,MOSTLY FANTASTIC,"I understand other comments about some of the moves being difficult to follow, but don't let that deter you -- this is a fantastic workout and you CAN do it! It may take some practice, but even if your execution is not perfect, you will reap the benefits. My only complaints are that you cannot skip around from song to song and she skips a move or two in the beginning of the first combination. It would be great if this dvd allowed you to navigate around all the combinations -- I learn each individually and then try it out after learning it. If this is the 3rd combination/song then I have to fast forward through the first two - I can't just forward arrow ahead. Other that that, this is a very fun and rewarding workout."
2,Not enough instruction,"I love dance aerobics and have been doing it for 15 years, but this is way to dancy with not enough instruction. You definately need a dance backgroud to follow her. I am going to keep practicing and hopefully I'll get it. To anyone looking at this product- it is not a dvd that you can just throw in and workout to. You have to watch all the preview moves and practice them several times and then when you do the video you will need to practice that seveal times before you feel like you are really using your time to workout."
4,Wonderful! -- unless you're looking for a quick fix,"This is a fantastic cardio workout. I understand those who are disappointed b/c they can't master it the first time they pop it in the DVD player -- but this is not a quick fix work out that you get bored with after a month.This DVD was designed for the long haul, for a great workout that uses all your muscles -- IT IS NOT DESIGNED TO TEACH YOU ALL THE COMBOS IN ONE VIEWING.The eight routines are unique and fun and I'm SOOOO glad she doesn't litter the actual workout section with instructions (don't you get sick of hearing the ""beginner instructions"" everytime you work out with other DVDs?).Yes, it takes time to learn, but it's not hard IF YOU SPEND TIME DOING THE INSTRUCTIONAL SECTION (which is actually fun!). Now that I've mastered the combos, I can just do the dances and get in a killer workout."
3,Aerobics with style,"This dvd reminds me of old school aerobics classes, where one needs to memorize each routine in order to get the full benefit of the class. It's a great dvd, and it provides something different than what other exercise cardio videos offer. The one problem - time consuming to learn routines. Is it worth the time?? I am not sure yet. Still practicing..."
1,cardio,"I had a hard time keeping up with this cardio, very hard to follow. Needed to try to teach it more slowly, too fast."
3,"Great Dance moves, but hard to follow.","Tracy Anderson Method Presents Dance Cardio Workout: She demonstrates some great dance moves and she breaks down the movements at the beginning, BUT, there are alot of movements and steps. When you get ready to actually put it all together it is hard to follow and remember all the moves, and I thought I was a fairly good dancer and coordinated. However, I love the mat workout DVD."
1,Way too complicated,I too was excited to have purchased this DVD and when I ordered and tried it - I was like oh my gosh I wasted my money. It is going to take me 1 month to get the dances down pat and who has time to do this? I just want a workout I can plug and go.
1,"Don""t waste your money!","She doesn't give good instruction, she just starts doing her own little thing, almost like she's in her own world. Hello!!!"
3,watch out for hidden extras!!,"the dvd was as expected and arrived on time, BUT, i had to pay 13.97p extra on customs duty, so overall a very expensive buy!!"
1,NOT WORTH THE HASSLE,"I ordered this DVD in October. The expected delivery date was October 28-November 15. Still haven't received. Tried to contact the provider: Tracy Anderson DVDs, and I could not get through to them. It is now November 23 and I had to start an investigation on this item. Now just got an email saying that they are just going to refund my money and I cannot get the DVD. Just a waste of time."
2,She is no dance teacher,"I have also danced all of my life and have no problems picking up routines. I had the hardest time trying to follow her combos though. When she breaks it down, she doesn't use the same beats that she uses up tempo. When she repeats a combo the second or third time, she doesn't do the exact same moves again. I don't believe she was ever a professional dancer.The biggest reason I don't like this is it is HIGH impact. Not for an aging lady like me, definitely not with my hard floors.On the other hand, I also have the mat DVD, and I really like it."
4,Challenging but worth it!,I ordered both of her videos and first off I have to say that I am so uncoordinated! I have to date only learned the first combo and then started doing the 2nd one last week. I want to learn all of the dance routines down pat before going to do the entire routine. It is frustrating at times but even gwyneth paltrow said that it took her a good year (i think that is a little exagerated) to learn the routine to where she felt comfortable doing it! I think with more practice and repetiion I will get it down pat and I have to say that I am glad I ordered it because it get's boring doing the treadmill and all the other cardio equipment too!
4,A great toning workout,"A workout for a womanly body! Tracy works muscles i never knew i had and doesn't attempt to bulk. The other videos i have purchased (ex. P90X) were great, but focused more on muscle bulking. It consists of a standing portion of repetitive movements in different direction focusing on legs, arms, and abs (the arms portion is killer but i'm feeling it and am looking forwards to lean arms rather then bulky). then there is a mat portion that is also a great workout. I like it and hope to actually stick to this one."
3,Lots of space needed,I think the video could be alot of fun - there should be a starter dance where the moves are the same only slower. its almost like shes a little kid bouncing around.Also if you need alot of space to do this video - so FYI if you are planning on doing this in your living room and you have carpet################ think again! you cannot spin on carpet!So I returned the video bc well I couldnt do this one at home and I was not going to do it in my driveway!
2,Not useful if you are not a dancer,"I tried some of Tracy's other workouts (not cardio) and I really liked them, so I bought this one. I think it is probably a great workout if you are already a dancer or someone who picks up on dance moves easily, but for the rest of us she goes waaaaay too fast and combines too many moves in each section. I am pretty disappointed and plan on returning my copy"
4,Great challenging workout.,The dances are difficult initially but once you learn the routines it's a super fun challenging workout. It took me 3 weeks before I could get through the routines but I did it. Can't do the dance workout every day though because it will take it's toll on your calves. I alternate between running/elliptical and dance cardio workout. Def recommend it if you've already been doing some kind of cardio and need to step it up a notch.
2,good for a change in routine but complicated and customer service poor,this is good to change up your workout routine but found it difficult to learn the dance routine so could not get a good workout. would be good in a class setting because would be easier to learn. If you are dance inclined it is probably great. I sent an email to her personal website and explaining my situation and asked for some suggestions but never got a response. I feel I spent $60.00 for the 2 dvds and would have loved some feedback. I was hopping the little people in this world mattered but I guess not. All in all if you can spend the time learning the dance it would be good for you but it is hard to find the time to learn.
3,If you have time and patience.....,"In theory this is a great workout....definitely going to take some time getting the steps down. If your looking to pop it in the DVD player and get sweating I wouldn't recommend this one. This is coming from someone with no dance experience. I do like her Mat workout though, much easier to execute."
2,Difficult to Learn,"I bought Tracy Andersons Mat and cardio dvd's and found the cardio dance routine to be pretty difficult to learn. I am not new to working out, I have been using The Firm for twenty-five years with great success.But due to bad knees I have been looking for a good alternate. I am not a dancer and have had a difficult time learning the routines. I only have an hour a day to work out, so it's frustrating that it is taking so long. I feel like I am not getting a solid cardio workout and usually stop to do something else.I do think if I could actually learn it more quickly, it would really give a great workout! So, if you are a dancer, give this a try. I think you will love it. If your not a dancer...be ready to spend a lot of time learning this."
2,did not like it!,"this workout video is hard to follow especially the dance routine,do you need to be a professional dancer to follow her dance move? and im not a beginner dancer! i dont recommend it! its a waste of my money!"
2,So Disappointed!,"I was very excited to do this workout after hearing and reading so much about it. I wish I had read the reviews on Amazon. If you are curious about Tracy Anderson you can go to the Goop website and download a lower body workout for free. I am giving it two stars because once you invest all of the time to learn the routines it's a decent workout. However, I could have spent the time doing a much more efficient workout and going about my business. I also think the price is entirely too much for what you get. I googled Tracy Anderson after I received my workout because it didn't seem like she was that experienced. There is a lot of shady stuff surrounding her business practices, I don't know if everything is true but it is interesting. I wish I had passed on this and purchased something else."
4,can someone answer one question regarding the dvd?,How much space do you need to do this and do you need hardwood floors?
1,bad acting,"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."
4,Good movie for guys that like fight movies,"First its a fight movie, so this ain't gonna be an oscar contender. So in the line of such movies as Bloodsport, The Quest, Best of the best, and other fight tournament movies this is pretty good. The fight scenes were well done and the story never got in the way of the fact that we want to see the fights. For this genre this is pretty good not the best of the bunch but it never tries to be more than what it is."
3,Undisputed III: Redemption,"I liked the first movie the best with Wesley Snipes and Vin Rhimes. The second movie starred Michael Jai White, it had good fight scenes between Michael Jai White and Scott Akins. As for the third...I would recommend only renting it. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this one, unless you want to add to your Steven Seagal movie collection."
4,One of the better martial arts movies in a long time,This is definitely one of the better martial arts movies ive seen in a long time. Nice twist at the end that was enjoyable. All in all a good buy ;)
5,THE MOST UNDERATED PERFORMER/SINGER EVER!!!,"There is no one in the world that can compare Sinatra, Bennett, Damone, Sammy Davis Jr. etc., to the unbelievable talents of Bobby Darin. He put all of them to shame. Arguably the most underated entertainer ever. Have been fortunate enough to see him perform through all of his transitions. Finally, Bobby realized that his niche was his roots, beginning with ""Mack The Knife"" and after. One of the most impeccable musicians EVER. Excellent piano player (Classical, Jazz, etc.), vibraphones, drums, guitar, etc. His talents were boundless. Sorry, but , can't expound enough of his talents and the tragic loss of Bobby on December 20, 1973. Am still mourning his loss to the world!!!"
5,perfectly,"this is perfect music ,perfect lyrics,and perfect woman.this perfect cd makes me happy.thank u jennifer.thank u.ur wonderful.your my everything."
2,What an utter disappointment.,"This isn't R.L. Burnside. This is a conflagration of hip-hop and rap artists taking R.L. Burnside's work and hacking it to pieces, capitalizing on R.L.'s fame and history.I wouldn't waste your money if your a fan of his works as a delta blues artist. This just isn't worth it.I'd be able to give this some credit if it was approached with some real composition/arrangement talent, but it's not. It's average, which is hardly fair to R.L., who is one of the fathers of the Delta/Hill Country Blues culture."
2,The emperor is naked,"Reading all the gushing positive reviews, I'm sitting here scratching my head, wondering whether they're perhaps listening to a different CD than what I have. When I first put on this album, it sounded fairly exciting. With the beefy blues riffs and funky beats, I thought I was in for a good time. But the truth is, once you hear the first ten seconds of any track, you've heard it all. This isn't minimalism, it's just simplicity. There's little variety, no depth, and when you hear the initial phrase of any given track repeat for the nth time, you can't help but wonder - what's the point? I have to give credit to Lyrics Born though - the two tracks that he raps on are hands down the best, though even they follow the rinse/repeat formula. It's too bad that his flows couldn't save the entire album. Two stars for the two LB tracks."
5,The Perfect Dictionary for the Pianist,I am so very pleased with this book. Of course the fact that it is written by Maurice Hinson was a pretty good clue that this would be a very useful book to own. The interpretations of phrases is very detailed and helpful. There are so many french terms that I've been unable to find anywhere else. This is definitely a great book for anyone that is serious about their music.
5,best dictionary for pianists,"I love this dictionary! I'm a piano teacher and my students and I use it often to get the true meaning of a word, such as ""allegro"" as it was understood by the composers and the time period in which they lived. It really helps you to interpret the music correctly. I know Mr. Hinson and he has done a wonderful job in helping to educate pianists. A must for all serious pianists."
5,Disabled travel book,Book arrived in great condition and is very helpful to know the best ways to travel with a disabled person!
4,Great Collection,"What more can be said about Sabbath? This is a collection of material from the Tony Martin years, some of the most underrated material Sabbath ever did. If you are under budget restaints and can't purchase Idol/Cross/Tyr/Purposes/Forbidden then this disc will get you a good idea of what the original discs are about. Don't sell Tony Martin short he is quite probably one of the best singers of Sabbath material out there. I've seen many shows and have many live discs with Martin on vocals and he does a fantastic job with not only his material, but Ozzy,Dio, and Hughes material as well - he's no prima donna, he sings it all and does it very well."
2,Ugh,"The only reason I am giving this book two stars (or any stars, FTM) is that my 2-yr. old daughter is absolutely crazy about it (why why why?). It's possible that any little girl who is nuts over My Little Pony will also request this book repeatedly. It is not at all well written...a lot of ""Rainbow Dash continued,"" ""Sparkleworks explained,"" ""Pinkie Pie wondered,"" at the end of dialogue. The story is not scary, so no worries. Pinkie Pie simply has a bad dream about being lost and lonely, just like the pony in the ""spooky"" story Rainbow Dash tells. In the end, Pinkie Pie is assured that scary dreams are not real, but friendship is. Anyway, for three bucks, you could stuff a Pony fan's stocking and make her incredibly happy while you try to keep from gagging from the poor writing and sappy story."
5,Inner peace and ethical living,"This is a truly great book, and I've read it three times now. This is inspite of the fact that the style is a bit dense for the modern reader.Personally, I have always been attracted to the Stoic emphasis on inner peace and ethical living according to the example of nature and the cosmos. It is not surprising to me that Aurelius was also a great influence on Henry David Thoreau.I understand that President Clinton cited this as his favorite book, though for the life of me I cannot concieve of him as a Stoic- Epicurian perhaps, but not Stoic....I was struck by Aurelius's repeated admonition that it makes no difference whether one lives 40 years or 10,000- you will still have experienced everything, for nothing is new and everything repeats in endless cycles. He is right, once you get past 40, these repeating cycles become more and more apparent...."
1,It would be nice if it fit a standard business card!,"This product is too ""short"" to fit a business card!

3,"Unique, but not quite there","Some good insights from these, but they're not pleasing in the tactile sense.

5,incredible tape series,I listened to these tapes in my car- They were fascinating! Everything you want to know about publicity and publishing-Six hours of action packed informationI recommend them highly
4,Interesting and Informative,"This book captured the meat of the Edmund Fitzgerald story and did it in a way that the was entertaining. I really liked the way the author presented every version of the disaster and didn't try to force the reader to accept one specific theory - we are allowed to make our own choice and possibly research further, which I will certainly be doing. It could have been a five star book with the addition of photos and maps."
4,best yet,"I've read most of the books about the Fitz listed at Amazon. I found this one to be the best. Schumacher nails the history of the region, doesn't daudle too long, and gets to the meat of the story: the crew and the ship, and ultimately, her demise. I recommend this read to anyone who's interested in the Fitz. I for one, am facinated with this subject, and this book satisfied all aspects of my curiosity."
4,Behind the music,"I learned so much about shipping, iron ore, and the story behind Gordon Lightfoot's song. It was a quick read but very enjoyable."
5,Feels like I was there,"Couldn't put this book down. Went to bed early just to read. Good detail, and heart felt accounts of the crew, and life on the mighty Fitz. Easy to feel like I was there."
2,Low picture quality,"It's been 4 hours, since I returned from Iceland, and one of my first things to do was to cancel my pending order of this book. Out in Iceland, I could have a look at what's inside, and quite a few of the pictures were disappointing. From someone with a limited amount of time (say, one week) and budget category equipment, this would be a nice book, but not from a professional photographer. Contrast is low in many of the pictures, and some of them were not taken at the right time of day (or right weather conditions).From this point of view, the book 'Lost in Iceland' was way better.I don't recommend it, if you want really nice shots."
4,Would make a great movie,"I could probably sideline with some of the disappointed reviewers, but neither references to Rolls-Royce nor time travel had a negative impact on me.Look at the reality - company that started with MS-BASIC release is world's dominant OS supplier! While Rolls-Royce already supplies aircraft engines, not much of a stretch to space, IMHO.I thought the technological and econo-political insights were brilliant. And let's not forget the sex scenes - they will leave you steaming ;)It certainly would have made one hell of a movie!"
3,Not Visionary Enough,"While the vision of things technical and scientific dance in the mind's eye like crystalline sugarplumbs... and that even the characterizations actually do work (it's easy to forget that exposition is character) and you do care about the people in the story... the basic idea that futuristic corporations embark on piracy of their own colonies simply fails on historical, political, and economic grounds as to invite disbelief, ruining an otherwise wonderful book. It was a ""concept"" that hadn't been really thought through, despite the parallel to the 18th century East India Company, and detracted from the book. Still, the idea could have been made to work and should have: Hamilton has shown in other books the ability to do better."
3,"Okay, but...","This goes off in a number of directions, some of them more interesting then others.It starts full off technobabble which I found irritating before the story settles down into a sort of sci-fi 'Kelly's Heroes' linked into a flashback history of the maincharacter (with some highly telegraphed plot twists) then into a story of urban warfare and then rather uncomfortably lurches into a 'finding ones place in the universeand doing things for the good of all' kind of thing.Some if it is exciting (the battle scenes are well written) and there are some interesting (if unworkable) ideas about inter planet economies but overall while readable it is a little too cluttered to raise above the average."
3,Good but lots of filler,"This book wasn't nearly as exciting as the Night's Dawn series. But it was a fun read, all the same. The clash between the ZB troops and the townspeople was the best part of the book.Now for the complaints:- Lots of boring exposition. Most of this could have been ripped out to tighten up the book.- The author loves the word ""indigenous"" and at one point seems to use it in every sentence.- The personality of the young Lawrence Newton is well defined, but the older Newton is flat and doesn't feel like the same person.- Like the Night's Dawn series, Hamilton solves everything at the end with a deus ex machina.- All the summaries and synopses of this book focus on a plot device that doesn't even appear until two-thirds into the book.That being said, it was a a fun and enjoyable read if you skip over the exposition."
4,Great,Hamilton is my man. Nobody puts on a better space opera. I have read everything he has written and want more.
3,"Not another ""Starship Troopers"" knockoff","This is an interesting read, although somewhat diligent reading is required to ""get into"" the story. It is NOT a ripping Buck Rogers style sci-fi adventure. Rather it is a tale of a man's search for meaning and how he can live out a dream. Many unusual situations and environments are presented and an overtone of warning and corporations and control is evident. Many times this book reminded me of ""Desolation Road."" CAUTION: Many uses of the F--- word and other profanities. It could have been better done without the simplisticly crude language, which to me is just sloppy writing to develop a character in a certain way."
4,evolution still thrives!,"Wow! By the time I had turned page five I knew that I was going to be hard-pressed to get any other work done that day! I liked FALLEN DRAGON!I finished the book, right in the place I'm sure Peter Hamilton wanted to leave me - wanting more! So I'm now on the hunt for his other works.The greatest gift I feel that Peter Hamilton gave me from reading FALLEN DRAGON, is the understanding that our human evolution is defintely not over!"
3,"Page turner, but slow paced and the ending is disappointing","Hamilton's novel of a soldier in a space army sent to other planets to loot their valuables(the economics of this being somewhat questionable, in my mind) paints a broad picture of interesting alien worlds. Alas, however, the book slows down in endless flashbacks to the main character's past--at first intriguing, but soon (especially once he leaves his home planet), you just want to get past them and get on with the main story.The story contains intriguing technology, interesting worlds, but the ending disappoints. ""Starship Troopers"" becomes ""By His Bootstraps"". It's just one deus ex machina after another, until the end.Hamilton, apparently a Brit, is not careful about using an excessive numbers of British expressions, with people who have no known British connection. He should be more careful. or else explain how English conquered the American language . . .It's good reading, and I'll read more of his. But it could have been better."
2,Started ok - but went downhill,"Nice hard sci-fi idea - but way too many irreverant details, the pacing gets slower and slower, and a lot of whats-the-point detailed sex. You almost got the feeling the author was enjoying writing about sex instead of it being useful for the storyline. Horrible ending. You had no feelings for any of the charactors. I actually skimmed the last 50 pages just to get it done."
2,"Nice, but could have been better without......","For the most part I enjoyed the book, except that I would say at 805 pages, I wished it was about 200 pages lighter. There were just some side stories that didn't help out with the main plot, and dragged things down.Another pet peeve of mine is when authors feel the need to give the details of sex scenes. I have no problem with characters having sex, I just don't want to know the details. I know there were only 3-4 sex scenes, but I don't think the details are ever needed. Why can't SF be SF...if I want erotica, I could make that choice."
4,A Solid Tale,"Fallen Dragon is a solid, entertaining sci-fi story. The world is rich and unique and the characters have depth. The technology described is novel and believable. The book is overly long and contains a couple of gratuitous sex scenes not appropriate for younger readers but overall it is a good read. Those who enjoy military and technical sci-fi will enjoy Fallen Dragon."
3,"Interesting, but flawed, read","The premise of this book is interesting. Colonies are not founded by governments or some sort of altruistic federation of planets, but by corporations who are in it for the money. These corporations require a return on their investments. This means they need soldiers to enforce this requirement - this investment gathering.Like another reviewer stated, it starts off well, but ends up grinding to a climax that seems rather forced, and sudden. The end seems rather like something out of a Twilight Zone or Outer Limits episode.I can recommend it for it's challenging plot and interesting ideas on the nature of humanity and our future."
5,Sneaky 'shocks' of the highest quality await you.,"Mr. Hamilton needs no introduction to Science Fiction buffs across the globe.Suffice it to say, his talents for 'outside-the-box' plot twists truly shine in this self-sufficient novel.A very well crafted story [benchmark worthy in my view] with plenty for all ages and preferences to greatly enjoy.Yes violence is featured in great detail but without the homogenised 'token-appalled' disclaimers from characters in the story. It just is what it is..."
5,Excellent,"This book arrived promptly and in the condition listed. It was securely packaged, and hadn't taken any kind of damage during shipping. Overall very impressed with the seller. The book itself is a great example of the science fiction. Peter F. Hamilton transports the reader to a pseudo-universe where inter-galactic companies strive to make profits over long-distance acquisition missions. The universe he presents comes alive with the help of a cast of characters that are fully dynamic, and that truly jump out of the pages as the story progresses. To anyone thinking of buying this book I'd also recommend Hamilton's ""The night's dawn trilogy""."
4,Good beach read but predictable ending,"As many other readers have explained, the book does suck you in and the descriptions of the equipment, patrols, and the fight against the invasion quite imagative and well done. However, nearly immediately in the first few chapters of the book you have figured out what will happen at the end, but the journey towards the conclusion is worth travelling. Not the best book I've read, but not a complete waste of your time either."
3,"If moving, You NEED this book!","Regardless of what you read below (from southerners), even the larger cities such as Atlanta are very Southern in overall character (e.g., few mixed race relationships as compared to major non-Southern cities, etc.). I am now in my third year there. Some people talk about the ""New South,"" etc. Forget it,....unless Miami counts! I'm a WASP and still feel like I've abandoned the 21st-century by living in Atlanta. To some of you, it will literally feel like a third-world country. (You'll DEFINITELY need cultural preparation if coming from the West Coast or Northeast). But, don't take my word for it. The culture shock series prints this volume separately since the American South needs special attention above and beyond the U.S.A. volume. And remember, the South includes Texas and Oklahoma. So, do yourself a real favor and get this book as well as related publications."
1,Broke on first use,"I didn't mind that the packaging containing the hardware had opened during shipping, requiring me to hunt down every nut, bolt and washer within the box. I didn't mind that one of the removable sides was bent out of the box. It's cheap, so I figured I was getting what I had paid for. But after assembling it, upon using it for the very first time, the handle snapped off at the spot weld where it attaches to the axle. Of course it's the weekend, so I can't yet comment on how this vendor's customer service responds."
4,It does the job,"Thought is was rated at 1400 lbs but it's the same as the one we had prior that was rated at 400lb. Regardless, it does the job hauling merchandise in town between our stores and warehouse. Would recommend to anyone unless you're hauling concrete."
2,Poorly designed for a heavy duty cart,"I bought this wagon for my wife to use in the garden and to haul wood (look at the photo they have for sales). I do metalwork for a living. I knew the sides were not strong enough upon assembly. In hauling some wood out of our small wooded area the wagon tipped. it was lightly loaded and it heavily damaged the right side. I was easily able to straighten it - - with my hands and a wooden mallet. But it still shows damage. I will toughen this up by welding some 3/4"" angle iron on it. I can repair anything that breaks, but it is a disappointment. My wife bought a double wheel garden cart in the 1980's. It needs to be rebuilt again :(I rebuilt the plywood once) but it is an excellent design and the parts were sturdy. This is not. It is tippy, but that will allow my wife to get it into our narrow garden entrance. It will have no use in the woods."
4,Pick it up yourself,"Note to self...as soon as you see complaints about shipping box damage, it means that the item is not meant to be shipped, and you can probably save beaucoup bucks by just buying it at a local store. I bought my cart at Walmar about 6 years ago. It's great for carting around tools and plants, although it can be heavy to haul things up hill. My garden club used it to haul heavy wooden sign without my permission, but it seems to be none the worse for wear for that one incident. Shop around, you can get these all over the place."
2,Diana Fox Running on Empty,"Hi, These are the track on this CD with I(SB# 090204 987726Tracks on CD1. Radio mix ...2:562. Central Sevenn mix...6:113. Marc Fox Club Mix...6:464. On The beach mix...5:26Great CD Give a voteThanks,"
3,Rachmaninov played with restraint and refinement -- but why?,"I am always of two minds about Mikhail Pletnev, a brilliant and original pianist who somehow loses any sense of excitement when he puts on his hat as conductor. This Rachmaninov Third Sym. is anothr chapter in his restrained, reticent traversal of Russian orchestral music (other chapters are devoted to equally bland Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev). He seems more interested in getting beautiful sounds from his Russian National Orch. than in forward motion, much less drama.I can understand why Pletnev wants to dissociate himself from the crass Soviet style that one heard too often, but he's deprived Rachmaninov of vitality along the way. Much the same holds for the Symphonic Dances, Rachmannov's last orchestral wrok, which cries out for more passion and abandon. I had lost interest long before this CD was over."
5,"Rhythmic, Mature, It Rocks!","Congratulations! You've discovered one of the best ""new"" artists. This band is so likable. The music has a mellow, yet intense energy that will have you continually coming back for more. If you own their first album, 'first attempt at world domination', you will be pleasantly surprised with this more mature, more tight set.Simply put, the best new cd we've listened to this year."
2,Not Iconic Enough,"I was expecting iconic sounding disco versions of standard Christmas tunes, but this didn't have the nostalgic sound I craved. They probably should have left this album to moldering piles of vinyl in Thrift stores and garage sales."
1,Rubbish,Played part of this once - poor quality and not worthy of Amazon. Returned the day I received it. I'd recommend choosing any other Christmas album.
3,Seems to work some,"It does seem to help in touching-up the edge of a knife when used in conjunction with the strop that I purchased.There are absolutely no instructions with this compound. Like how to properly apply it to a strop, and when and how to remove it and reapply new compound."
1,Overproduced & Uninspired,"Over-produced and uninspired, this album provides a perfect example of how bad rocksteady reggae has become. Gone are the brown-sugar bass lines and tickling rhythm guitar licks. They are replaced by tinny drum machines, annoying synthesizers (whatever happened to the Hammond, a piano or the 'real' horn section)and poorly executed dub-stylings.Credit will always be due Mr. McGregor when it come to his powerful vocal abilities, but the foundation of 'Masterpiece' is cracked and crumbling. The album 'Big Ship' still remains his best and one of the best roots albums ever cut."
2,Disappointing Biography,"Walsingham is a fascinating subject, his character and talents long overdue for a thoughtful and well-written biography. Sadly, this book is neither. The organization of the book is incomprehensible, and Walsingham comes through as a cardboard character who is secondary to what may be the author's real intent: a major bashing of Elizabeth I. Even that is badly done. Repetitive name-calling (sour virgin, dittering, post-menopausal)is not especially instructive in revisionist history. Despite the author's lack of overview or analysis, however, he does allow the character of this brilliant spy master and diplomat to peek through occasionally, especially in the chapter on Walsingham's fondness for the arts. This man may have been a religious Puritan, but he was not puritanical by any means. For those bits of occasional vitality, I give this book two stars."
3,If He Could Only Sing........,"Love the music. The Band really swings and more artists need to perform this kind of music. However, can we get some that can actually sing? Even Louis Prima could sing better than this; and he was a trumpeter. Go for downloads, not purchasing. Save the cash for Buble, Connick and Dusk."
3,"Good fiction, poor overview","There are some fine stories in here, but as usual Ellen Datlow lets intra-genre politics inform her summary of the horror field. Once again, she refuses to acknowledge that authors like Bentley Little even released a book this past year (which he did--the brilliant social commentary THE STORE), and goes on and on praising lesser lights who have not offended her. The stories are worth reading, though."
4,"Year's Best Fantasy and Horror, Fifth Annual","Standout stories here are Holdstock and Kilworth's chilling ""The Ragthorn"", Cherryh's ""Gwydion and the Dragon"" and McGrath's gruesome ""The Smell"". Also worth mentioning are stories by Koja and Kushner, among others. There's the usual useful overview of the industry, and the usual stock of cutesy (De Lint) and nonsensical stories and bad free verse, but this edition contains more truly good work than many of the others."
1,The Years Horrifyingly Best Politically Correct Stories,"Datlow & Windling's backpatting of personal acquaintances is the basis of their editorial choices, and adherence to political doctrine. Their ""years best"" collection for 2000 includes Ursula Le Guin twice, and this authors writing is little more then fanciful icing to make her de-hydrated cause (feminism in this case) more palatable."
2,Not for everyone,"I was really excited when I first saw this book but was turned off by the religious content when I actually read it. If you're not Christian (and I'm not), this book is definitely not for you. I'm sure this is a great book if you're Christian but since I'm not, it didn't help me at all."
5,"Humane, concise, humorous encouragement from a REAL person.","This is must-read for anyone who feels ""backed into a corner"" in their life. Gavin's encouragement and call to confidence apply to all realms of human life, with witty, practical anecdotes and, sometimes, blunt humor and courage. No self-pity here, but rather a call to arms for those who feel they may have been bullied into meek submission by the medical ""establishment"". In everyday terms, Gavin reaches out to people in pain--physical, mental and emotional--with his story of survival and suggestions for how they, too, may have victory!"
3,Good but there are better boks out there on the topic,I like his writing style but he coul dhave covered some of these topics with a little more examples that could relate to my circumstances and friends going through this now
1,WHY??,This is a total rip off. I got seasons 1-3 togther for 36.99 at walmart and season 4 is only 15.99.
4,You have to pay the Troll Toll if you want inside this DVD set...,"1. Best show ever +5 stars2. Full screen -1 starFor the uninitiated it's like ""Seinfeld"" only darker and funnier. But if you are searching for this product you're already familiar with this show, and know it's awesome (my only complaints were the addition of Danny DeVito (I'm over that now, and like his addition to the cast) and the shoe-horned product placements in the current season, especially Dave & Buster's... weak.Regards,The Nightman"
2,Buyer Beware! Full-screen only,"Just a disappointing FYI - the disks are Full-screen only. Apparently other than the blu-ray Christmas episode, seasons 1-4 only come in Full-screen.The show is great or I wouldn't have purchased the disks, so I'm not giving low stars for that, but the Amazon posting does not specify them as only Full-screen, which they are. Who in the world today wants FS as the only format? I probably would have waited for a future Blu-ray release had I known, but I got all 4 @ 44.99, which was way too good to pass up.Just got them today and there are some good extra features, plus I'm glad to have them all and not have to rely on Hulu to post 5 @ a time, but I'm still bummed at the surprise FS letdown.Looks like the price has been jumping, so you may want to wait until it drops down again before buying."
3,Sunny,"This was a gift and I don't know if that person really likes the gift?????, But I enjoyed giving it...."
5,best show ever,"This set of seasons 1-4 was a steal at the price I paid for it, which was just before season 6 started. I purchased season 5 separately"
5,Hilarious,"I have always loved this show and if you are a fan of people acting like idiots but have no idea that they are, then this is the show for you!"
5,Love this show,Far and away the best comedy show on TV right now...would give it 10 stars if I could!
1,Rip Off Pricing,"this is a review of the box set, not the program (which i think is great).at the time of writing, amazon have this season 1-4 box set priced at $83.99. why would you pay this much, when there are no additional special features included (or at least, none are listed in amazon's scant product details section) ?you can purchase the individual seasons collectively from amazon for $64.97 (and potentially for less if you buy from marketplace sellers):It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia - Seasons 1 & 2It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: Season 3Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia: Season 4"
4,It's Always Sunny,The seasons themselves are awesome. Hilarious - no complaints. The only problem I have is that one disk out of each season won't play in my DVD player - I have to watch them on my computer. Possibly not an issue since my DVD player is somewhat of a piece.
4,Hysterically Funny Show,"If you are the type of person who hates political correctness and cute family sitcoms and reality shows ABOVE ALL THINGS, you will definitely enjoy ""It's Always Sunny"". The main characters in the show have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and every episode is about them trying to make a buck at someone else's expense in some sleazy scam. Be sure to join the guys at Paddy's Pub, the worst bar in Philadelphia!"
5,Funny!! Great Deal!!,This bundle pack came with seasons 1-4 and it was a great deal. The show is hilarious and was definitely worth the money. I bought it as a gift for someone and they were happy with it.
5,excellent compilation,"Im probably considered a newbie to Goth and Darkwave, but I have found this compilation to have some really interesting and good tracks from a variety of artists. Artists I have not been exposed to yet. CD 3 is my favorite with many songs I liked. I recommend this release"
3,Fair and even handed (Like Fox News)...,"This is, for the most part a good compilation of some of the less notable bands of the mid to late 90's goth scene mixed in with some of the big names of the past couple of decades. It may not be worth the 40 bucks cleopatra wants to charge you for it new but it's definately worth the looking for a used copy if its in good condition."
2,unacceptible,"This product is advertised as helping to grow back lost hair. My hair loss is due to thyroid disease and is not genetic, so I thought this product would help get some hair back. So far all it does is dry out my scalp."
3,"1 OK, 1 DOA","Bought 2 batteries, one was dead on arrival and would not charge. The other seems OK. They were very cheap, you get what you pay for."
3,T-Shirt,"The T-Shirt is great and arrived real quick. The only thing bad is that on the web site it looked brown. When it got here, it is actually dark red. My husband wears blue jeans and t-shirts most of the time and they do go well together, but if he absolutely wanted brown, the shirt would not have been the right one.Woodbridge"
3,Good game for SmartCycle,"My son actually hasn't been completely in love with the Smart Cycle. However he does love this Diego game, and is his major motivation for wanting to play.Somewhat educational, teaches kids how to think for themselves in navigating and choosing games and components."
4,Smart to Go Diego video,This was a Christmas gift for nephew. He loved his video and I was his favorite aunt for the day! Lots of fun.
5,Fell for the Holga!,"I love this book. The pictures are gorgeous, and I love my Holga, although it is quite temperamental, but this book will show you what the Holga can do."
3,So-So But Worthwhile For Some,"Fans of Italian Cinecitta, and of the Radley Metzger-type softcore sex films will be interested in this erotic pyschological thriller. The plot is neither here not there - a psycho is terrorizing a beautiful young woman by saying he can prove her husband is a murderer, and she submits to all kinds of humiliation and abuse at his hands for the sake of saving her man. The ""twist"" at the end is not necessarily predictable, but not too interesting, either. But the film is worthwhile for three reasons, mainly. 1. Despite the tired plot, the story is played out well by all actors 2. Ennio Morricone's breezy, light psychedelic soundtrack is pleasant, if not among his best works 3. Dagmar Lassander, who plays the vitimized woman, is stunningly beautiful, a treat to look at, even when wearing the most ridiculous dresses and outfits. If you're into Metzger and the whole Audobon films thing, or if you just like cool-looking, late 60's Italian films, this is worth a viewing."
4,Easy,"Love this test kit. easy instructions and fast results. only reason I did not give a 5 star, is the first kit that came was missing one test."
2,HM digital TDS meter needs further evaluation,"Delivery was as stated, and decent price. However out of the package the TDS readings for tap and filtered H2O are way OFF! And I verified same H20 with another test kit. The latter was in accordance with City of Phoenix H2O dept. Now I'm not giving up totally on this instrument as bottled H2O came in as expected and in accordance with the other 'watersafe' city water kit?Not exactly sure why my Tap and filtered water read (almost the same) and above 600 every time?? Unless the accuracy of the device is just off with any H20 except bottled or distilled??Rick"
3,A bit vague,"First of all I have to say that the only part of the test I used was for water hardness. That test gave a color scale and myself being one of the 10% of the male population that has color vision problems, I had to guess. I live alone and was not able to refer to someone with correct color vision. Even if someone had been available, the scale was not graded well enough to get a close rating. It was marked at every 20 hardness rating so I had to decide what the color was closest too in order to set my water softener. It did give me a starting point, but I will still have to tweak my water softener settings to get the best setting."
1,Watersafe WS425B Drinking Water Test Kit,"This product, which I purchased Oct 28, 2009, EXPIRED August 2005 (more than 4 years ago). The research I've done on expiration dates for 'water test kits' indicate that they should be used within a year after expiration - but never more than two. Additionally, if the product wasn't stored properly, it wouldn't be able to give accurate results when used for a test taken within its vaid period.Amazon, please tell me how to return this product for my refund. Thank You. Allen"
2,Over-priced product,"The product is easy to use, but it is over-priced. I bought another water test kit just to compare the results. To my surprise, what's inside the other kit was the exact same content, only the brand name was different. Watersafe sells the same product at $17.40, while the other brand sells at $12.88."
3,"Same Kit as First Alert, only more expensive",Just wanted to confirm that this kit contains EXACTLY the same test as the First Alert but First Alert is much less expensive.First Alert WT1 Drinking Water Test KitOther than that the kit seems to do what it's supposed to do.
1,Missing chlorine/ph test,"The kit I received was missing the chlorine/ph test. Reading reviews of a similar product it sounds like this is a common problem, not sure why they're selling incomplete kits but it's quite annoying!"
2,No iron test?,"I specifically bought this test over the other ones as it stated ""Iron: Causes Metallic Taste and Reddish Color Staining."" and I'd noticed my water had a colored tint to it at times. In receiving the test, it doesn't seem to mention any iron test at all. I don't know if I got the wrong test, or if that description is wrong, but it's definitely disappointing."
5,Works!,Works great and at a great price. Used it to test my hard well water so we could get the right filter. Provided accurate and reliable results. Would recommend!
1,Woodwick candle fizzles ... out,"I had high hopes for this idea ... a cracklingfire candle.How sad to discover that the sound is more likethe fizzle of an Alka Seltzer. I followed theinstructions to trim my new Woodwick candle to1/8"" but it would not stay lite unless thecandle was shaken by hand to keep wax on the wick.When you stop shaking the candle the wood burns away andthe flame goes out. Your left with a glowingorange ember on the end on the wick ... no flame."
5,Fireside wookwick candle,"I have purchased a few of these candles for myself and gifts. They are unique, the crackling of the wood wick is fun and soothing on a Vermont winter night. You need to trim the wicks to prevent smoking, follow the directions. I love these candles!"
2,Wish these didn't make so much soot!,"I love the smell of these candles as well as the sound they make while burning, but they make 20 times the soot of regular candles."
4,Nice Candle !,"I ordered the Fireside scent because I have been trying to find a candle or wax tart that smells like the real thing. The candle arrived quickly and well packed. While the wick does give off a crackling sound, it is very faint, and you have to be right next to it to hear it crackling. The scent is very soothing, and fills the room lightly. It doesn't smell like a campfire or fireplace as much as I would like, but it is still a nice fragrance. The jar is beautiful, and I will find a way to reuse it when the candle is gone. I will most likely order this product again, because I do enjoy it. However, if you're looking for something that smells very much like the real thing, this is close but not quite there."
5,Great for when I'm studying !,"As a college student, I often struggle to focus during studying. I have this candle placed on my desk so when I study and can listen to the soothing crackle of this candle. It really is peaceful and smells absolutely wonderful !"
2,Little fragrance and sound,I was hoping that this candle would afford the fragrance and sound of a wood burning fireplace to burn when my gas fireplace is on. It had little of each. I would need to burn ten of these to get that effect. The price with shipping of $25 was not worth it.
2,"It has a fragrance, but..............","it is not like a burning fire. If anything, it has a spicy smell. I was so disappointed. I don't think a candle has been invented that can do this."
3,Fun crackle but fragrance has nothing to do with a fire smell,"Got this as a fun aside with electric fireplace...which looks warm but lacks the crackle of a fire. Wood wick does crackle, but room must be silent. Enjoy it reading a book, not watching a movie!"
3,Just OK,"I purchased this because I was in a local store that was burning one, and it smelled just like they had a fireplace going. I haven't burned mine down as far as hers, mainly because it doesn't smell the same. While the smell is pleasant, it didn't smell like a fireplace. I'm not a big candle person, as I have allergies and don't like strong scents. So, so far, I'm disappointed."
1,Poor quality?,This came broken. The glass was shattered in the packaging. Dangerous to open actually. I don't know if it's the packaging or the product. Maybe think twice about buying this.
5,Awesome!!,"Reading the review above is not exactly going to give an accurate picture of this awesome candle. First, as with most candles, the wick needs to be trimmed to a length somewhere between 1/8 and 1/4 of an inch. I usually keep it trimmed to about 1/4 and have never experienced a smoking problem, nor a high flame problem. Not sure about the wax sloshing issue -- I don't make a habit of picking up lighted candles.This candle (not this particular scent, however) was a gift from a friend, and is absolutely our new favorite kind of candle. The scents are strong enough to fill up about 1600 sq. feet, but not so strong that it seems overpowering. The wood wick truly does crackle as if you have a small fire going, so it's great for people that live in a part of the country where it just won't get cold enough to have a fire in the fireplace.I **highly** recommend this candle. I'm giving one to everyone I know for Christmas this year."
4,"great smell, no crackle","I got this candle (not this particular scent) as a gift and I use it all the time. Like other reviewers said, the scent is strong but not overwhelming and the candle burns very well. But I was disappointed with there being no real fire crackling sound. When I 1st lit it I could hear a little bit of sound but no one else could hear it at all. So don't get too excited about it having a real fire sound but as far as a candle, it's great."
5,Amazing Candle,I just now for the first time purchased this candle only in an applewood scent. OMG how beautiful the smell is instantly and not overpowering. I also love the crackling. The crisscross wick - no problem. It's perfect!!!I will be buying more of these for sure and soon!
5,So excited to find these,"I bought this as a gift, and it went over very well. I was estatic with the quality when I opened the shipping package, which was very well packed I must add. To see it lit the first time was exciting. It crackles softly and smells and looks fantastic. It is modern, and looks more contemporary in it's jar than many other jar candles out there today. These candles are pricey, but they last a long time. I am so glad I found the Fireside scent. It is perfect as a gift for a man - the fragrance is soft and woodsey."
5,Good for More Than Coloring,"This is an awesome coloring book. It's also good to have around and NOT colored so I can keep reviewing terms in my head. I would have felt lost last semester without this purchase. It was recommended by my professor and I see why. Definitely a good ""between classes"" review out in the courtyard. It's like having ready-made flash cards."
3,Very basic,This anatomy coloring book is ok but I've used better. It doesn't seem as complete as I would like it to be. Very basic.
4,Great Study Tool...Some Errors....,"I bought this coloring book to help study for my Anatomy & Physiology class. I did not rely on this to help me study for an exam or anything, but I would use it in conjunction with my text book to really get familiar with the locations of the structures. The diagrams are really clear, and I like that there is a brief description accompanying the structures as well. The reason for the 4 star review is just the fact that there are some labeling errors in the book. If all the errors were corrected I would give this 5 stars for sure!"
2,Not worth it,"I was very disapointed in this book. The first caption I loked over had errors in the writing. I also found errors in the labeling of the drawings. Although the information provided is helpful overall, I am wary to use it for review due to its inaccuracies."
2,Be on your toes!!!!!,"I was delighted when I first got this - I'm a first year medical student and it was really helpful in getting to grips with basic anatomy. However the more I read around my subject, the more errors I picked up on - mainly in the labelling of the drawing (e.g p239 mandible labelled as maxilla, p231 endocrine cells labelled as exocrine cells, p249 renal artery and vein labelling mixed up, p251 renal sinus labelled as hilus). Don't get me wrong - I know a lot of work has gone into compiling this and the drawings are great, but the attention to detail is sorely lacking. I've done about 8 pages so far, and as you can see 4 have had errors. Use it by all means, but don't rely solely on it."
1,Didn't Meet My Expectations,"I bought this reel and was disappointed. First of all, the template they provided for the mounting bolt positions did not match the actual mounting plate. Four more large holes in my wall I had it installed. Then the real complaint. The tension is very difficult to adjust. I felt like I was going to break the hose I had to pull it so hard to get it fully extended. Then, after it retracted, it coiled off of the reel, making a huge kinked mess of the hose and created a job of resetting the hose tension, etc. I returned the unit and have ordered a Rapid Reel hand crank unit. It isn't as sexy as an auto rewind reel, but it works!"
5,Ewé Orisa,"I recommend this book for every one that need to have a better knowledge bout Ewé Orisa. Is not easy to read and learn it couse is necessary a previous experience, is not a easy book but it's very important for conserve the culture Yoruba and tradicional religion. You'll not find ifa verses in this book but medicines and prepare with herbs and plants. In my opinion will be important to put it somes if verses with their Odu."
3,Butler NutriSentials Lean Treats for Dogs,While I have purchased this product in retail and veterinarian offices I found this purchase to be somewhat stale and harder than others purchased. I suggest you check your sell date before shipping.
4,Larger treat for larger dogs,"The treat size is about two times the size of the non-large breed treat. The treat is recommended for dogs 50 pounds or larger. Here's the ""funny"" part, the dosage is 1 treat per 10 pounds of weight. Our dog is a Great Pyr, and is about 160 pounds. That would be 16 pieces - about a half pouch. We only give two treats at a time.I ordered the 8 count, and the first pouch of treats opened aren't soft, but they aren't hard either. The other reviewer commented on the product being stale and hard. I think the product, regardless of merchant, is a hardish product. The first bag we received from our vet was about as hard as the ones received online. Our dog doesn't care, he LOVES them."
5,"Great product, great price","My lab loves these, and I don't have to feel guilty that I'm making her fat. Costs way less than buying them at the vet, and they're not really available anywhere else."
2,the Berlin Gala,"CD received was damaged in cover, and it made a weird noise while playing. Very disappointed because I had high expectation to enjoy the music when I received it."
3,PBS respectability and a Carmen from Iceland,"This Cd is basically a ufnd-raising moment from PBS--ice enough, glossy, nothing really wrong. But the spirit of Carmen the gypsy is nowhere in sight, and between Abbado's careful conducting and von Otter's very chilly Scandanavian singing, I found little to enjoy."
3,Maybe not that good...,"I'll offer a dissenting opinion. I didn't find the information in the book to be all that informative. There's little if anything different from what the manufacturers claim in their literature. Some of the sections seemed to be direct quotes from the manufacturers. Too brief, too many short blurbs. For me, it didn't help to distinguish between the wheat and the chaff in the aftermarket."
5,Used book,Good condition. Just what I was looking for. Life who wanted information and just What I was looking for. Nice
3,Pleasant diversion,"Not bad for something different in holiday listening. Thought itmight be more fun, but a couple selections were good, but therest not as entertaining as those. Another group had a goodalbum a year earlier, but I forgot who they were. Same title,but preferable."
5,Must own!,"This is a fantastic ""holiday"" CD. It is amazing how they blend the two (Klezmer & Nutcracker Ballet) into one. You'll never listen to the Nutcraker Ballet again without thinking about this delightful CD."
5,Klezmer Nutckracker,"A joyful, multidimensional, and in places humerous variation on the classic Christmas music of Tchaikovsky, this CD brings together an entertaining and festive blend of klezmer sound and classical music. In addition to the great sounds, the titles, the moods, the album graphics, and even the song names (Dance of the Latkes Queens, Waltz of the Ruggelah) are funny and artistic."
