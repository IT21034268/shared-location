4,Fuller keeps on keepin' it real,"This 2005 set on the Savant label finds Fuller backed some true veterans of hard bop. While not ""innovative,"" this album cooks up a tried and true recipe that everyone can enjoy. For a guy in his 70s, Fuller doesn't just continue to perform--he continues to steal the spotlight from younger musicians, too. This is definitely an essential album of his to own.Curtis Fuller (trombone)Javon Jackson (tenor sax)Doug Carn (piano)Rodney Jordan (bass)Fritz Wise (drums)"
1,Not authentic!,"Many professional and lay people have given this a positive review, but my study of the book reveals it strays significantly from the way the Zuni people tell this story. While it may be poetic and well written to an uninformed eye, it fails miserably to convey the values and concepts within Zuni culture. As such, it cannot be used in a unit that teaches children about Zuni people."
5,The Truth About Literacy in Perfect Poetry,"After receiving Steve Layne's book ""Teachers' Night Before Christmas"" as a gift and meeting him at a conference, I had to have this. Real teachers writing about real situations makes for funny and sad moments, and this brings them all home. Having taught several grade levels, I could relate to so many of the poems. Our literacy committee just met to begin an in-district project, and our coordinator passed out a copy of this book to every committee member, and then read a poem to open. Now I have two copies which is just fine with me."
4,Life's literacy lessons,I think Mr. Layne did a great job with these poems. They are poems to make teachers and parents think about literacy and reading instruction in general.
3,Baroque Music,Much to much church music. I would have preferred a smattering of modernbaroque music also.
5,"Wow, are you serious?","If you are an Aaron Tippin fan, then you will love every song on this cd. If you are not, then you will write bad reviews. I have heard Tippin songs that were meant to be cheesy like ""Honky Tonk Superman"" but that is his style. I have never heard a bad Tippin song. He has that ""Honky Tonk"" sound that makes you wanna grab a beer and a pool cue. I am sure that someone from New York would never understand that, but here in Texas we get it. If you know that distinct Aaron Tippin sound and like it, then you will love this cd as well as his others."
5,Excellent Sensor,"What makes this sensor so good is that it is wireless! I have not had any trouble using the sensor, works through wood and brick easily. It has a local digital readout so you can also use it for a display where you are monitoring. It mounts handily using two screws, and it is removable from the mounting bracket. I highly recommend this unit."
3,Good Thermometer,"Great product. Why 3 stars? Well, you can get a main unit that is packaged with this remote sensor for about the same price. Yes, you can get two thermometers for the price of one. The pricing strategy of Oregon Scientific remains a mystery to me."
2,handy but undependable and short-lived,"I have the main unit and 3 remotes to monitor temperatures in my greenhouse and garden area. The unit is very handy for monitoring high and low temperatures and has high and low alarms to let you know when limits are exceeded. I am disappointed in the quality. The hygrometer in the main unit always reads 9-10% humidity from the day I started using it. (I know this is not the case as I live in a very humid area.) The remote units began to fail after 2 years of use. For some reason their signal is no longer received by the main unit even within a foot of each other and both with new batteries. Also, even when the units were working properly, sometimes the signal would fail to reach the main unit for periods."
2,RH very inaccurate,"I tested the Oregon Scientific BAR913 (basestation) and THRG268 remote sensor against a calibrated thermometer/hygrometer at work in a controlled lab environment.The actual RH was 55%, while the basestation indicated 45% (close enough)and the THGR268 indicated 26% (this is so inaccurate as to be useless).Both indicated a temperature within a few degrees of the correct value,which is quite acceptable.Since others indicate their unit is accurate, it seems it's luck of the draw whether you'll get a unit that measures humidity accurately.This is likely due to tolerances in the humidity sensor and associated circuit elements. Unfortunately there is no provision to calibrate these units. A simple variable resistor would have made that possible."
5,oregon scientific,merchant sent order in a timely fashion only grip i have is I was trying to combine orders to save on shipping amazon not clear on who the orders are coming from but otherwise happy
4,"Good, not great","Fairly accurate, but not precise. Also, a replacement unit costs more than a completely new system. Oregon Scientific has a very strange pricing model."
5,Really great book...,"wow, i just finished Apocalypse Memories and it was really awesome! Its the best of the Buffy series in a while. The religious aspects of the novel were so powerful, and the philisophical debates between Buffy and Michael were intense. Really great writing, very original/creative plot. this is an outstanding novel"
3,Have you even seen the show?,"This book did not stay true to the characters!! Buffy is not gentle with Spike at the time that Willow returns. Buffy doesn't drive!!!! Giles is not that uninvolved, and Dawn could never be so unannoying!!!"
4,The gap widens between Obi and Anakin,"This was an excellent book for those following the Obi/Anikan rift that just seems to deepen. to me the highlight of this book is when we get to see what happend to Obi-Wan when he fell into that nest of Gundarks that he refers to in Episode II.The in this book was that Zan Arbor shows up, still up to her medicical misdeeds as she creats what is called ""Zone of Self-Containment"" in which Anakin finds himself trapped in.I must admit this book is not as ""clift hanging"" as most of Jude Watsons books are...but it is very very enjoyable..and does build to the JQ #8A definate ""must"" for lovers of ""Jedi Quest"""
3,Does the job,"I was trying to replace the one I had for years but this must be a different model. It is not as sturdy and does not have a button in the back to reverse the projected time. This would allow you to face the clock towards you and still project behind it. Right now, I have to face the back of the clock to me so it projects right on the wall. The projection is bright but it is small. It takes a day to sync the time so don't panic. Just plug it in and be patient."
2,Returned it,"This is not a terrible clock, but it would not project onto the ceiling above the bed. I returned it and bought one that would from Hammacher Schlemmer."
2,Disappointment,"Set up of this clock is difficult because of the lack of visual information in the ""how to"" pamphlet that comes with it. The atomic clock has not functioned since I got it and I have to set it manually. The led projection is not bright enough and the numbers are too small. Sorry I bought it."
2,I like the older model better,I had one of these clocks about 7 years ago and loved it (and accidentally dropped it and broke it). So I ordered this one so I could easily see what time it was by just looking up at the ceiling. This model just wasn't the same. I couldn't get the projection to enlarge well enough for me to see the time on the ceiling. I also didn't like that I couldn't see the time without hitting snooze so it would light up long enough to see the time. I'm going to research and see if they still sale the older model and order it. I also ordered one for my 80 year old parents for a Christmas gift and they had the same complaint. But the return process was wonderful and I quickly got credit.
2,Almost Useless,The projection on the ceiling is much to small. I have to put my glasses on to read the numbers. Larger numbers would have been satisfactory.I bought this to use in a bedroom at night. It just did not do what it was purchased for.
3,Only lasted about 3 years,I bought this projection clock three years ago. It worked great. Perfectly clear projection and the light did not keep me awake from the bedside. Always accurate time. Then one day it just stopped working. I've had super cheap digital clocks that I bought for about $5 that have last for over ten years. Weird that it just broke. Not cheap for only 3 years of usage...
3,Okay for the guest room.,"Disappointing! The numerals are too small and there is no adjustment for how it's displayed on the ceiling. You have to set it correctly on the table or dresser for it to reveal itself readable. In my case, impossible without rearranging my room. I wouldn't recommend this item and the MFR. should be ashamed for even peddling it."
4,quicker lock on but dimmer,"This OS clock was a replacement for an earlier model (that was damaged by leaking batteries). I found that the clock locks onto the sync system much more quickly than the older model did and I like the new on-clock display screen.The projected display, while adequate, is both smaller (as projected on the same ceiling) and dimmer than the earlier model. The focus mechanism is not very smooth and, unlike the previous model, lacks a rotation capability. Thus, if you want the clock to face you from your nightstand, the projected time on the ceiling is 90 degrees from what you'd like. I compromise by putting the clock at about 45 degrees."
1,Waste of $$$$$$$$$,"Had a projection clock from Oregon Scientific for 5-6 years, which was great. Therefore this product is very disappointing because of the following.1) The light is very low so you can barely see the time displayed on the ceiling even when the room is completely dark.2) The image is very small.3) The image cannot be rotated so when you have the unit on your nightstand the image is not displayed straight above the bed."
1,Projection is dark and small,"Unlike some other Oregon Scientific projection clocks , the projection of this model is relatively ""dark"". Only about 50% brightness than other OS's popular models; the size of the digits are also smaller. Unless your ceiling is less than 10 feel tall and the room is very drak, otherwise please do consider other models."
1,A piece of junk,"Simply put, the projection is worthless: it is small, fuzzy, and unreadable if there is any ambient light. In addition, it is built like a piece of junk. Speaking of ambient, the vendor I bought it from, Ambient Weather, falsely advertised it as providing a bright clear projection, and when I complained they said I would have to pay the shipping both ways, and they would take 2-6 weeks to refund the purchase price. NOT a customer-oriented vendor. I don't advise buying anything from them.Again, don't bother buying the clock. It only encourages marketing of junk products."
2,No pleasant blue glow,"For the amount you are paying, I'm not sure it is worth it. You might as well shell out a little more for a clock you can really be happy with. I have 2 gripes about this clock. The backlit is not a pleasant blue glow but a sickly greenish-yellow; since there is no setting to keep the backlight on, you need to press the snooze button to get it to light up. Second of all, if you are lying down with the clock facing you the projection on the ceiling is perpendicular to you so you either have to get used to it or turn your head sideways to read the time. The atomic clock does its thing, mine set itself after 5 min. I could also read the display on the ceiling well enough. No problems with clarity there just wish it was right side up. Now that I have done more looking around you can actually just pay 20 something dollars for basically the same product with LaCrosse, therefore I would say this product is overpriced."
2,Oregon Scientific Projection Clock,"The clock's LCD display can not be read from across the room during daytime or even with an overhead light on in the evening.This could be corrected if the light that illuminates the clock face had an option to remain on. Currently, one hits the bar on the top of the clock and the clock face is illuminated for 5 seconds and then the light turns off. The second option would be to replace the LCD with an LED readout.Also, when using the projection feature the display is clearly visible, but it is reversed/upside down. One has to turn the clock almost backwards to get a correct view of the time on the ceiling."
2,.NO 90-degree rotation,Tiny little blurry numbers projected onto the ceiling and NO 90-degree rotation (even thought it clearly says there is one in the description). I've had an older version Oregon Scientific Clock for years and this new one doesn't come close.
4,Not that bright,"The clock does well, it's extremely easy to set up . But it isn't as good as my previous one. Unfortunately, my previous clock didn't have a band name, model, or any identification on it. This clock does beam the time across the room and will focus to a nice sharp image. The only thing I am not satisfied with is the brightness. My previous clock had a switch to brighten or dim the clock on the wall."
2,Does not work right consistently,The unit does not dislay the time and temperature correctly. I am working with Oregon Scientific to fix the problem.
2,Returned,Projection light was not bright enough to see clearly. Previous projection clocks were very bright and clear.All the other features were accepable.
2,g,The projection on this item is not clear. The light perhaps needs to be brighter. The only time I can see the time is when the room is dark. The other one I had was much better. The projection was larger and I could read it in the day time. I would not suggest this clock to anyone. I would rather have one like the one I had before.
3,Great Atomic Projection Clock but a poor alarm clock!,"I selected this clock mainly because it was Atomic and that it would project the time to my ceiling. I am thrilled with both of these features, it successfully updates itself with signals from the U.S. Atomic Clock, and the projected time is easily readable in the evenings.However, if I were to depend on it as an alarm clock, I would be extremely disappointed. The button you need to press to turn off the alarm is almost impossible to find, especially when you are half-awake, and not wearing glasses! The configuration of the controls is terrible! When trying to turn off the alarm, it is really easy to press the ""Zone"" button in error, which immediately changes your time to the next zone!If you depend on an alarm to wake, I would pass on this clock. If you are a little OCD, as I am, and want to know that the time being displayed is absolutely correct, and you enjoy the time projection feature; then, this is the clock for you!"
2,Nice Looking but Poor Design and Short-Lived Projection Feature,"This is a nice looking clock but it has design flaws as noted by other users. The close layout of buttons is hard to use and the small base allows the clock to tip over when trying to adjust the settings or alarm. It keeps accurate time just fine through the atomic link, but sometimes the clock will reset itself to 12:00 and then take several hours to correct itself to the proper local time. Unfortunately, the red projection display has a short life expectancy as it will go out after about a year and there is no way to replace the bulb, LED, or laser (not sure what is used) that emits the light source. This is the second OS projection clock that I have owned, and both had projection lights that ""died"" after about a year. Due to these flaws, I can't recommend this product. Oregon Scientific commands relatively high prices for their products, but just doesn't deliver the quality you would expect."
2,Hard to read,The projected image from this clock is too dim and too small to be comfortably read. I would not purchase this particular clock again. I bought Oregon based on prior satisfaction with their products.
3,Could be better,"The Oregon Scientific RM318PA projection clock does what it is supposed to do, but the limited control of the projected image leaves the device somewhat of a disappointment. Focus is the only control which is an absolute ""must"" if the clock is to be useable at all. But the projected image isn't big enough. Other similar clocks allow the image to be either rotated or flipped vertically to accommodate the viewing point of the person looking. This model only allows projecting at an angle from straight up to something forward of the clock."
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"Although the ExactSet Projection Clock keeps excellent time and is easy to operate, there are some difficulties I'm experiencing with the product. The display is very dark and difficult to read, and the projection is not only small and dim (disappearing when there is any other light source in the room), but is upside down and backwards. I have very poor eyesight and wear glasses, and to read the clock without my glasses on, I have to pick it up and hold it about 6 inches in front of my face. Without my glasses, I can not even see the projected time. And the alarm is fairly quiet and shuts off after 2 minutes. I tend to sleep right through it. Even though I realize most of these problems are subjective, I have to mark down this purchase as a failed experiment. Luckily, it was fairly inexpensive."
1,Great for young kids.,"Placed this unit on Grandmas table and her ceiling is 8 feet high, The clock displayed on the wall at least than 3/4 in. Cannot see in the light and cannot see at night unless you stand up and look at it when your only tow three feet from it. TOTAL WASTE OF YOUR MONEY"
3,Not satisified,Doesn't lite up very well on the celling.Very fuzzy and not very large numbers.Wouldn't buy this product again.Not recommend by me.
3,I still raise up to find the old clock. I may never learn.,"It's not as bright on the ceiling as I'd thought it would be. Nor are the characters as big as expected. There's a lot of fine print instructions that might solve all my problems. I'm not ""there"" with this device. It's taking concentrated effort to get fully in control. I couldn't get the alarm to keep from coming on at 06:00 for several days. A bummer. It probably does exactly what advertised. It's just taking me longer to comprehend all the ""features"" than it might take a younger user."
4,RvB from a different perspective.,"After all of the events of the saga, freelancer Agent Washington has to find members of Blood Gulch to help him fight against a new threat known as the META.This is a terrific follow-up to the Blood Gulch saga and will please many who expected the RvB crew to be done after season 5.I personally really liked Reconstruction because it had a sort of outsider's view on the Blue and Red team members. It kind of takes a pause from the (always funny) vulgar jokes and awesome references and plays it serious for awhile.It's actually pretty cool to see the dramatic side of RvB but it doesn't go on for too long and gives the viewers back the jokes, funny happenstances and of course, the Caboose.In my opinion, Reconstruction is a perfect way to bridge the Blood Gulch Chronicles with the newer stuff and to introduce an awesome ""straight guy"" character to all the humorous ones in the series. Definitely a great addition to the RvB machinimas and worth buying."
3,"The ""Big Twist"" is a big disappointment","This series had a LOT going for it. It was fun and exciting and on the whole one of the best of the RVB series; EXCEPT for the big ""revelation."" I won't ruin it for you, but we discover a critical piece of information about the RVB universe that supposedly explains everything that happened in the Blood Gulch Chronicles. Some of the new information does make sense mind you, but the big ""mind-blowing"" secret that is revealed leaves even more holes in the plot than it fills.While this season is more serious than any previous series, it is still very, very funny. You NEED to see it if you are a RVB fan, and the extra stuff on the DVD is awesome too. But be prepared for disappointment here and there, and remember to suspend your disbelief. Even by RVB standards, this season's plot is hard to swallow."
4,Red Vs Blue Reconstruction,This latest offering from Rooster Teeth was pretty good. I will definately be waiting for the next installment of this series. Be warned though that this DVD is a little more darker in story and there seems to be more cursing in this series than previous ones. This is deffinately an adult title like all of the others but you probably know that already.
3,Good Company,"The product was delivered ahead of time. No one else had this DVD. My son was very happy. Once he put on the DVD I wasn't so happy with language, but I'm very happy with the company that sold this product. Wierd!"
5,For Red vs Blue fans,This is a good addition to a Red vs Blue collection. It follows up from the 5th season and introduces new characters. If you like humorous mysteries and puzzles this is the thing for you. It'll twist your mind and make you think for hours.
3,Reconstruction is...interesting.,"After the Blood Gulch stories ended, the RvB series has sort of evolved into something else altogether. While there's still a fair amount of comedy here, overall this is a serious dramatic tale -- something that RvB fans looking for straight comedy may not like so much. However, if you enjoyed the first five seasons, you should enjoy this one as well. You get to find out a lot of secrets about the crew in the show, you get to see where they end up, and a few new, very interesting characters are introduced. It's not bad, overall, just different from where the series was going before this disc."
1,Bird said NO!,Stains contents of cage. Bird would not eat it after trying it. A few pecks and that was it. Switched back to regular unflavored ones .
4,Dusan is ingenious,"This album contains some very exciting and enjoyable examples of modern classical guitar music. The compositions are, for the most part, first rate; however more contrast between the pieces would have added to the quality of the album. The performance quality is also very good. I believe future generations of classical guitarists will look back on Dusan Bogdanovic, and see one of the compositional geniuses of our time."
2,not that interesting book!,"The practice questions are easlier than the actual questions on the exam. Some techniques were taught. That is about it.I would recommand books like ""Princeton Review"" and the ""Official Guide for GMAT"". The first book teaches one all the techniques that one needs to know to do well and the second book gives one plenty of practice questions."
1,Kitchen Cart,I ordered this as a gift for a friend and then helped her put it together. The drawer did not open and close properly and the shelf for the wine bottles did not fit properly and finally the whole thing wobbled. We disassembled the thing and put it back in the box and I returned it for credit. I ended up going to a local home store and finding just the right thing already assembled.
3,More counter space for tiny kitchen.,"For it's intended purpose it's fine. it looks good well finished of course it comes un-assembled. I was surprised that all the parts were there,every screw bolt, etc. It took awhile to put it together and I made lots of mistakes that had to be redone. the instructions leave a bit to the imagination and one does need to have a good spatial frame of mind. the casters are flimsy, the large through screws need to have their heads hardened one assembles it with an Allan wrench get a cheater bar for it cause it is hard to drive the screws into the sometimes pilot holes I suspect that some were drilled off- center be careful if you make a mistake like I did and need to take it apart.The weak link are the screwheads. Now if you need aditional counter space for a small kitchen this is the ticket."
1,Not worth the money,"The best part of this purchase was the quick delivery. After, taking inventory of all the pieces required to assemble, the nightmare begins.First, the top with the leaves supposed to come secured were not. The long bolts to secure the posts requires great strength to secure as the hex wrench really does not grab the bolts properly. One can do much better by finding a similar cart locally already assembled and avoid the excessive shipping charge and headache of trying to put together a particle board inferior product."
4,"Stick-on PSA Sandpaper Roll, 4.5"" Wide, 10 Yds. Long, 80 Grit.",product works great and as advertised...only wish there was a bit more stick to the adhesive backing. Tends to slide a bit with pressure applied.
5,Received as advertised,This material was silicon carbide as advertised. It worked well in my application.
2,Great geneological resource,"I am a fan of Gary Jenning's ""AZTEC"" and reading Carl's book helped me to understand my families place in the conquest and settlement of northeastern Mexico. The American schools of my youth did not teach us about our ""hispanic"" heritage and by reading this book and many other local history books, I have a better understanding of the history of my relatives. ""With All Arms"" helped me to tie in to the painstaking research Mr Duaine conducted in the creation of this historical gem."
2,Joel,"Joel is loved by millions, but his books fall flat. I bought most of his stuff and it has no meat to it. it like having dry toast. Joel can tell stories but these books are DRY"
5,World War II,My 10 old grandson requested a Book about World War II. He is very interested because his grandfather was in World War II. He asked for an Eyewitness book because he loves all of them. It was a very interesting book with lots of pictures to give him a sense of how things were in that War.
4,AppleTV - impressions,"The first impressive part was buying the AppleTV through Amazon - the prices were ridiculously cheaper compared to the local prices here in Australia. Even adjusting for currency changes, I saved 34%.The machine itself works a treat. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. Set up was easy-peasy.Movies and music streamed without problems.Occasionally, there is a delay in the initial sync-ing which Apple failed to disclose. This is despite using the latest N-hubs.All in all, as long as you've got an HD TV, an Apple computer, iTunes and a hub, the AppleTV slips into the family network with ease.4/5 for usability5/5 for access4.5/5 for long term tolerability (occasional hiccup with syncing scoring a minus 0.5)"
3,Pretty good - but misses some features,"I am a big fan of apple products. While this device works great for Pictures, Movies, Previews & Music, I think it misses the boat on Videos. I was planning on playing the videos on my Mac via AppleTV, however, they would all be need to be imported into ITunes to be played. That seems like an unnecessary requirement. Also, the device is locked down so only certain codecs can be played without hacking the unit. This means unless everything is in the Apple supported formats, you are out of luck. It doesn't even play .avi or .mwvHowever, for a straightforward way to access you media, rent movies, play youtube, etc, it is a very compelling product if the limitations above don;t bother you."
2,Where are the rentals?,I purchased the Apple TV primarily as a vehicle to rent movies only to discover that many movies that are available through normal rental channels are not available on the Apple TV. It is an elegantly designed device that now just sits there due to lack of content. Check the Apple Store for the type of content you are after before spending your money on the product.
4,Best Thing for TV since DVD,"This is an awesome item, although I would recommend going with the 40GB if you want to keep your photos on it. The menus are clear and fast and more and more content is added every week. My only complaint is that the remote is a little too simplified and it would and a more suggestive search interface would be nice (or a wireless keyboard addition)."
5,Great Device,"This is a great device to get all the content from your PC on to your machine. The movie rental part is great, but Apple needs to work on getting more content. Over all I love this device."
5,Revolutionary Product...,"'AppleTV has allowed me to cancel my satellite/cable TV. I have the ability to buy my favorite TV shows and rent or buy movies right from my Television set. I have an off-air antenna to receive all the major networks in HD for free. I'm saving a ton of money and I control what I want to pay for, it's a beautiful thing. 'AppleTV also allows you to buy and play music/music videos right from your TV. You have access to YouTube videos and podcasts. It works great! I would recommend you spend a $100 more for the 160GB version. 40GB disappears fast when it comes to video."
4,Apple tV,"Apple TV is a very cool item. It allows you to watch or listen to any media from your Mac computer. It connects both wired or wirelessly and works very smoothly. For anyone who is considering dropping their cable due to the cost of it, you can buy and rent movies via itunes as well and buy TV as you go. For someone like me who only watches a few shows, it is perfect. I can still watch the shows I love (standard def TV shows are 1.99 and high def are 2.99) and save a bundle.The interface is not very Apple- it is awkward and a bit not-user-friendly but overall I love this product. The coolest thing is making movies in iMovie and then being able to watch them on my 55 inch TV- the quality is awesome and they look so professional!"
2,Buyer Beware!,"Look up ""Apple TV disappearing"" on google or the Apple support site to see how many people are having issues with this product. It worked REALLY well until Apple upgraded to iTunes 8.0 after which it will NOT synch and has essentially become a brick. Apple has done nothing to resolve this issue even though it has been an ongoing problem. The wanted to charge $50 for a 30 day ""troubleshooting"" period with one of their specialists. (the $50 charge is because he ""took the time to learn about the product"".) The product became useless overnight. I have not been able to use it for 6 months. Even if they do fix this issue, the next upgrade may mess it up again - another $50? This could get expensive...."
1,Apple Fails To Deliver Again,"I've been an Apple user all my life, and I wanted to love the AppleTv. I tried to show it off to my Windows friends, but nothing they have would play, and my ""special"" H264 videos will not play on their systems either.Needless to say, I was embarrassed and out almost $400. All my Windows friends are watching DVD's from their Network Storage, and this Appletv is only oneway play, no network support.Why can't Apple give us something good for once that impresses for more than just a slicked up case?"
3,Photos and Music...,"After having the AppleTV (that is such a bad name) for about a year, here is the quick review.Viewing photos and listening to music on the unit is great! This is by far the best streamer out there for these 2 things. I have had many in the past and they were ALL bad. This one is great.But...watching video is pretty lame, YouTube just looks like garbage in general so I don't even look at that. And, the videos purchased from the iTunes store don't look great on a large TV. The box also turns itself on randomly...not just mine but other people have commented about this as well. For me, the AppleTV is worth the pricetag just for the Photos and Music...I leave the video to other devices."
3,Very limited applications,"First, I love Apple products and wanted to like this one. Out of the box it installed as easily as you would expect from Apple, and I had it up and running within about 90 seconds of opening the box.I then downloaded a Lost episode, and streamed a Lost episode to test picture quality on my 24"" Sony HDTV. The picture quality was terrible. It wasn't ""near DVD"" quality, it looked like a heavily distorted 480i picture. My connection was HDMI, so I don't think anything about my particular set-up was a problem. The TV, as I mentioned, is a Sony I bought about 8 months ago.Interestingly, the graphics quality of the menus and album art was very good, so it clearly wasn't a connection issue.Bottom line for me was the picture quality was not acceptable (and not even close). Being stuck with Itunes content I could maybe live with, but not coupled with that kind of quality. I'm better off just watching the Lost episodes on my laptop and with my Shure headphones."
4,Great unit - needs more space!,"This unit has really changed the way I play music at my house. I don't ever deal with CDs anymore. But the 40 GB capacity wasn't nearly enough so I got an upgrade from WeaKnees (you can now buy pre-upgraded units on Amazon from WeaKnees).I got the unit for the music, but now we've been renting and watching HD movies on here too - it's pretty amazing."
2,There is only one thing bad about Apple TV: Apple's insistence on closed systems,"I give it two stars for the following reasons:- Device stays on, even after you put in 'standby' mode. All this does is to turn of the video. Also, putting Apple TV in standby mode requires pressing a button for 5 secods!!- The device in its current form is VERY VERY restricted. It is impossible to play anything that is not in iTunes and not MP4. Both cases do not really work for me since I have all my movies on a RAID - that includes family movies in Divx and MP4 and so Apple TV would force me to add all this to iTunes and convert it to MP4.But Apple being Apple, I don't think I'm in their taget market. If you're looking for a solution that let's you buy online content, the Apple TV might be it."
3,Rushed to market,"The Apple TV sounded like such a good idea I had to have one but I have had nothing but trouble with it. The manual is grossly inadequate and when you ask for support, the tech is obviously reading off the website the same article that I just read. They do not seem to know any more about it than I do: and the store is worse. Obviously rushed to market but a good idea."
1,Never recieved order,"I ordered the Apple TV from DataVision here at Amazon and even payed $20 for next day shipping. 3 weekes later, my DH birthday came around and I never recieved the package.Waiting to be refunded but ended up without a gift."
1,maybe better with a Sony?,Adds volume but overall I would say the sound quality is very similar or not as good without this device. I use it with my Olympus WS-300m. Maybe it would work better with a Sony. It is also more prone to have interferance and it will make a loud noise when it picks up on something. I don't use it just in case it makes that noise I don't want it to ruin my recording.
1,dont buy,i bought this knowing that sony usually sells great products but it sucks it makes no sound quality or level difference what so ever with the voice recorded and does not work with the computers built in input either (i would give this no stars if i could)
2,An Ok mic,"A small stereo microphone from Sony.Pros: 1. Quality made and durable2. Great looks and clean design3. Does not require batteriesCons: 1.Sound quality2. PriceNow, having this mic for a while, I'd say that it suffers from 3 major flaws:#1 - Very quiet#2 - Does not pick low pitch sounds, thus record comes out very unnatural#3 - Persistent white noise and high pitch hissing"
3,Not What I thought,"This was a good quality mini little mic, which wasn't what I expected, but oh well.I bought this with my Kodak Zi8, and I thought it was going to be something I could use to record me without clipping on my shirt, but no... and that was my fault, but oh well.This has good quality and I used it to record vocals on some songs I did, if you go to [...] then you can search for my A Day To Remember - If It Means Alot To You cover and it is a very capable small mic.I used it for voicing over a few videos, and once I got a cable and plugged it into my computer so I could hold it and use it as a mic for a webstream.VERY CAPABLE MIC!"
3,Good For The Price.,"This Mic Will Most Likely Be Better Than The One In Your Camcorder, It's The Reason I Bought It. Ultimately This Mic Is For Voice Recording, But It Does Record Guitar Pretty Good."
1,Terrible sound quality - especially for the price,"Not sure if this unit is defective or if it is just built poorly, but using it as an external mic with a GOPRO HD Hero 2 was NOT what I was hoping for.The breakdown of issues in order of least to most severe:1, It is very quiet. Maybe only 70% of the volume that came from the built-in mic that comes with the GOPRO.2, Even with the muffler, it picks up any kind of wind and it overpowers the recording which makes it useless in an environment where there is any kind of air movement.3, This one is the nail in the coffin: It makes a very audible buzzing sound and it doesn't stop. It's a like three or so buzzes, then a pause and then a few more and so on.I probably could have dealt with the first two issues, but the constant buzzing is a deal breaker. I am sending this back for a refund."
1,nice but,"This is a great looking, high quality built mic. However it is not working with my samsung Galaxy Note N7000 nor with the iPhone. Kind of lame.Also NOT working with macbookpro5 stars for built and quality1 for not working."
2,Sounded terrible with Kodak Zi8,"I purchased this to use with the Kodak Zi8. I was shocked to find out how terrible the sound quality was when I received it. In fact, I found that the sound with the built in microphone was better than this Sony mic. Not recommended with the Kodak.Pros:Easy to plug inIncludes carrying case for micCons:Terribly low sound quality.Picks up all background noise."
4,Great Additional Feature,"Not a huge technical person, but I really like this product. Bought this for a plug in mic to record concert footage as a personal interest on my Kodak Zi8. It is an absolute must for its portability and quality of the audio it records. Most of the products I previously used for recording would have terrible audio, but with this plug in and the wind screen, the quality is 20x better. A great value."
4,Great,"I used this the first night I got it. I just purchased my first motorcycle and although there is a lot of content online for my bike, this is a great background for understanding what I am dealing with and how the bike works. It helped me troubleshoot why the engine wasn't turning over and now I know way to much about carburetors!"
5,Reviewing Haynes' Basic Techbook,"For someone new to motorcycling, just coming to realize that riding a bike involves care and feeding, but who never maintained their own car, this book provides an essential overview. Read this book BEFORE reading through your owners manual and repair manual, if you're not already a grease-monkey. It's overview of each aspect of motorcycles is so clearly written, with plenty of detail and specs, that you'll enjoy reading it as much as you do your motorcycle magazines."
3,"Good, not great","Pretty fast read, good overview of motorcycle technology. I especially like how it addresses how different manufacturers approached problems.If you can find this book at a library, get it there first to see if you think it is worth buying."
5,Great intermediate-level book on motorcycle mechanics,This is a good buy. Plenty of technical detail on all aspects of a motorcycle. No padding (just information). The book also discusses variations on the models described. The only complaint I can think of (and its minor) is that it would have been nice to see some troubleshooting information on the topics discussed.
4,Do read the reviews before buying,"In the first review of this book are the words: ""Don't expect this book to allow you to fix your bike.""This is absolutely true: this book is for people with little or no mechanic knowledge -- it's a great primer, but is NOT any use as a workshop reference.If you already know something about bikes, this book will teach you little new (although it was nice to finally learn what a desmodromic valve was :)"
1,Yuck!,The mint flavor was way over powered by the touch of rosemary. The chocolate itself was very chalky. Terrible quality. Terrible taste.
2,Not worth the effort,"I had one of these products when my baby was first born and it's just not worth the effort. The amount of water you are told to use seems to vary. Sometimes it warmed the bottle perfectly, sometimes got it way too hot, and sometimes didn't warm it at all and then I had to wait for the crazy thing to cool completely before trying again. Not to mention that very quickly, the numbers on the tube used to measure the water wore away and I had to guess. Finally, I quickly discovered that, when my baby gets hungry, I can mix a fresh bottle in about a minute, instead of waiting for this thing to take 4 or 5 minutes. There's no sense making a crying, hungry baby wait any longer than it has to."
2,warming not reliable!,"I am quite disappointed w/this bottle warmer. First of all if you have Dr Brown's bottles this is not the warmer for you.... formula leaks out of the bottles during warming especially if you are warming them with the inner device (gas reducing unit) in the bottle... must be removed for warming or formula rises up the chamber & out of the bottle. Secondly, even when filling the water chamber to the max- I still get cold bottles after warming & need to rewarm them a second time (& by that time baby is screaming in hunger). I dont know if there is a better warmer out there but this one gets a thumbs down from me."
4,Love it!!,"I have 4 month old twins boys and got two of these as gifts, before they were even born. They are GREAT!! Its makes it so much easier and I can warm both bottles at once. Ive never had any issues with over/under warming, since if you read the instructions it explains how to get the bottles to the desired temp. I highly recommend it!"
3,"It was okay, but not great","I found this warmer to be jsut so-so. The positives are is that it's nice and small and can fit in the corner of any countertop. I found that after you played with the measure cup for a little the bottle temp worked out fine. Use a black marker to mark the water level you liked. The negitives are that I found after a while the heating element on the bottom began to rust, making the bottom of my bottles orange colored. I thought it was easier to just use warm tap water and mix the formula in."
3,Heats up fast but confusing instructions.,"I got this in the mail and soon opened it and read the instructions. Most of the instructions were pretty straightforward except the part about how much water to add. I didn't even try it out for a while because I was so confused about how much water to add. When I finally did try it I added way too much water and the bottle heated up very fast and got a little warped. THIS BOTTLE WARMER USES VERY LITTLE WATER AND THE WATER WILL BOIL! Once I figured it out it heated up the bottles very quickly, but I have to watch it pretty closely to make sure it doesn't get too hot."
2,Inconsistent,"I bought this to take out the guess work and hassle of warming bottles, but it is not working for me. I try to set it so that I can turn it on, go change the baby then it would be ready. This method works occasionally but I get inconsistent results. Whenever the light turns off, the milk is still cold and I have to let it sit for another few minutes to finish warming. If I wait too long it's too hot, so I have to stand there and wait for it. Occasionally when I warm a bottle it somehow seems to boil the milk out if it. Don't know if the top of the bottle was loose or what but I'm finding it easier to just go back to sitting bottles in hot water from the tap. Very disappointed."
1,Guess I didn't know any better,When my wife and I first received and used this warmer we thought that this was a great product. Over time we soon realized that boiling the water to cause steam that heats the bottle is not optimal. It leaves a water residue on the bottle and more so on the warmer itself. We even tried using distilled water. It was not until we tried the Avent warmer that we realized how the two are very different.
1,WARNING - Safety Concern for potential burning,"We used this product for one week. It is unstable and when you pull the bottle out, the bottle may still be hot. Our nanny was using the product and accidentally tilted it over while she was holding our baby. The water spilled out and burned her leg. It is really sad.Either really think carefully about safety considerations before and during use of this product, or simply don't buy it."
2,worked for a few months,"This warmer worked well for a few months. The switch stopped working and the warmer would turn on as soon as it was plugged in. Now the heating function never turns off, so I have to watch the bottle carefully before it overheats the formula. I still use it, I just don't walk away from it because I know it won't turn off on its own as it should."
5,Faster than Munchkin warmer,"I've only had this warmer a couple days, and I LOVE IT! I bought this for grandma's house, but decided to keep it myself after testing it out. I was using the Munchkin warmer but this warmer warms in half the time. Very nice design and works well so far."
2,Cannot be used for MAM bottles with the utilivent,I have a First Year Night and Day bottle warmer and I have to heat my bottles in one bottle and then pour it into my baby's bottle because the steam makes my MAM bottle leak. If you want to heat in your MAM bottle you have to use an Avent bottle warmer or a warm water bath. Or do what I do and dirty two bottle for the use of one.
1,Bad,"2 weeks of use. It doesn't shut off so it overheats and smells like burnt plastic. Dangerous item.When it was working, it is really long to heat up a bottle on top of the headache to figure out the amount of water to add. My screaming hungry baby hated it, took many minutes for a 3oz bottle and it was either too cold or too hot."
3,You get what you pay for,"As a new mom who is currently still in school and not bringing in a lot of money, I was looking for an affordable bottle warmer and I came across this one. I read the reviews and it got ok reviews so I bought it, boy was I disappointed when I finally started using it.I wouldn't say its horrible but it's really not the best, it doesn't take long to warm the bottles and it shuts off once it's down; however, it doesn't always warm the bottles up in one use OR it will get it so hot that you end up having let the milk sit so it's not too hot for baby and when your baby is screaming that's not an ideal situation. So basically you get what you pay for, I really wish I would have spent a little more money to get a better warmer."
3,get what you pay for,"Good things - quick, quiet, and easy to operate. Automatic shut offBad things - my first one broke easily by burning itself out (despite added water), inconsistent heating.I use the one I have infrequently and purchased a more expensive Dr. Brown one for my more common usage - it also has autoshut off, but heats more consistently and you can adjust the timer as well as there is a water reservoir, so you don't have to measure out water to put in it each time. But this model is much more expensive than the babypro."
1,unsatisfactory,"I would not recommend this product! My baby likes warm food so i ordered it, thinking life will be easier. It does not work! I tried to use it, and it did not work, I had to use a microwave instead."
2,NOT RECOMMENDED FOR GLASS BOTTLES,I tried to research whether this bottle warmer would work well with my Born Free glass bottles but I was unable to locate information so I ordered it to try it out. Instruction manual states not recommended for glass bottles. I tried to warm my glass bottle anyways but it turned out dangerously hot. I then tried to warm the bottle in the attachment included to warm baby food jars but it did not heat the glass bottle at all. I returned this product and went back to warming my glass bottles by placing them in a mug of hot water.
3,So-So,"While this works ok for the regular width bottles, it doesn't work so well for the wide neck bottles right out of the refrigerator, and unfortunately you cannot add more water to accomodate without fear of overheating the unit."
1,broken right out of the box.,"This warmer seemed like a great idea, except that the little light never went on, to tell me that the bottle was ready. Unfortunately, it was broken right out of the box.I'm sure that not everyone will have this problem, but it was kind of pointless for me to use it."
3,Not helpful!,"I was lucky to have a baby who did not need a bottle that was perfectly warm, but using this warmer was a waste of time. I packed it away after only using it a few times because it rarely warmed the bottle enough. If I added a little more water than the directions suggested, it was way too hot. I stick my daughter's bottle in a mug of hot water and it warms up much more quickly and does not take up counter space."
1,not very effective,"I was looking forward to using this, but it did not function as I had hoped. Following the instructions on how much water to use based on the size of the bottle, the first bottle I tried still came out cold. I then increased the amount of water to put in, and the bottle came out hot, but the formula was still cold. Then it says you have to wait 10 minutes to use it again! I am going to return it and stick with the microwave. Shaking the formula afterwards gets rid of any fears of ""hot spots"" in the bottle that the baby might feel."
3,It 's okay....,"This bottle warmer is okay, once you get the hang of it. Sometimes it is either too hot or too cold. If you put too much water than you have boiling milk or if you put to little water than the milk is still cold. I like the fact that it is automatic. I finally got the hang of it and 99.9% of the time the milk is the perfect temperature. It is small and I can pack it in a small diaper bag to take to Grandma's."
2,Completely stopped working,"I used this warmer a total of six times before it stopped working completely. It was convenient the six times it worked, but who wants something that only works six times? I'm returning it for another one."
5,Love it!!,"Fortunately I received a Gift Card for Babies R Us and I decided to purchase the bottle warmer because going to the kitchen at 2:00 am and waiting to boil water, then waiting for the formula to warm up was a waste of my sleep..I love being able to add the desired amount of water, press the button, and go...You do have to experiment just a little to warm the milk to your baby's liking..But once you have it, it's a sleep saver! My advice to new mothers is buy this item, but make sure to clean it as directed as it will comprise the heating ability..."
4,Used this daily and loved it,"After I went back to work, my brother-in-law stayed with us to take care of our daughter. He used this about three times a day for about 5 months to warm up the breastmilk I left for him in the refrigerator (Avent bottles). We never had any problems with it, and I've got it out and ready to use for my next baby, due in a month. I love that it doesn't take up a lot of room on the counter and that it's so easy to figure out (even when you're tired!). The only drawback, I think, is that it can seem like it takes a long time to heat up a bottle if your baby is crying for it, but if you have some sort of schedule going it's easy to avoid that issue."
3,It does the job . . . but there are better,"This thing did a fine job heating up the bottles. I found it difficult to heat up small bottles, because if you put a couple too many drops of water in the steamer, it would practically cook the formula. For larger bottles, it was fine.There are other warmers that look far better than this one. Given the fact that you will use this thing many times a day for many days, spend the extra ten bucks and get something a little better."
2,Not warm enough,"I have this warmer and don't like it. The recommended amount of water (in the directions) isn't enough to heat the bottle. Secondly, if you want to heat a second bottle or a jar of baby food immediately following the first bottle or to further warm the original bottle, you can't. You have to wait 10 minutes before the heater resets itself. A crying child isn't patient enough to wait that 10 minutes."
3,It's OK to me,This product is Okto me but not really good. It can't makes the milk warm enough although it doesn't need too much time.
3,Be Careful,"This is a nice gadget to have because it is good at getting the job done quickly, however, you have to be careful.There are more times that I overheat the bottle than get the temperature just right. The chart in the instruction manual for water measurements and bottle sizes can be a bit confusing.I guess good advice for using this bottle warmer would be to always put less than more. You can always heat milk again, but it's a pain to wait for it to get cooled down when you have a whiny, hungry baby and a bottle that's way too hot.So, just be careful!"
4,Simple and effective,"We have two bottle warmers so that we have one on each level of the house - this one and the more expensive Avent model and yet I prefer the First Years unit because it's simple to use especially in the middle of the night. I love that the water is steamed up and you don't have to empty it out like you do with the Avent model. And, I've found this unit to be more successful in achieving the desired temperature over the other model.Only thing I don't like is that because the water gets steamed/burned up, it leaves a burned residue in the bottom which has to be cleaned out. However, I still prefer to do that than have to empty water out after every use as is the case with other units.So, $20 model is easier to use and more effective than it's $60 competition. Go with this one - we wish we had two of these instead of one."
5,Great Bottle Warmer,"We've been using this bottle warmer for 3 mo's. Mommy pumps milk, refrigerates it and then we heat it when it's time to feed. We love this warmer! It takes up very little counter space and heats consistently time after time. When the milk is ready it shuts off automatically so we can multi-task. It was priced right, too!"
2,No time for guessing!!!,I was not happy with this item. You have to keep guessing how much water to add!! Sometimes a certain amount was good but the very next time that same amount of water could be too much or too little. [...] It just didn't work well for me.
1,I can't believe I wasted my money!,I bought this based on reviews.... it worked well for about 2 weeks. 1st- the white numbers on the side of the water measure wore off. Then it just quit heating as it should. It took 2 -sometimes 3- tries to get the bottle warm; or it would go from being very cold after one run to being practically being boiled on the 2nd try! The price was right... but tured out to be a total wash.
1,Extremely dissatisfied with this warmer,"This warmer heats differently every time. Sometimes the formula is way too hot and sometimes it feels as if it hasn't been heated at all. It is very difficult to deal with when your baby is crying because he is hungry and you have a bottle that you either need to cool down or heat again. I wish that I had bought a different warmer and I would not recommend that anyone buy this one.Also, I have only been using it for only six weeks and the numbers have all worn off of the measuring cup. I had to scratch a line into it."
2,1st years bottle warmer,Pretty unsatisfactory product. Arrived very quickly. Doesn't heat a bottle any faster than running the bottle under hot running water. My nanny has simply refused to use it.
5,Great time-saving device,"If only I would have known of this with my first child, things would have been much easier. With the warmer we no more run to get hot water in the middle of the night, or even during the day, and within a minute we have the formula at the temperature we want. Once you know how much it takes (depending on the thickness of the bottle) by trying it using different amounts of water, it is so simple to use.Together with an insulated bag, night feedings are almost fun."
1,Instructions indicates not used for glass bottles!,"I received this bottle warmer a couple of months before I had my daughter, I thought it would be the best thing. I opened it, threw out the box and set it up. All ready. As I read the instructions it states not for glass bottles, we use glass bottles so, what is it good for. The warmer should have a temperature gauge where it gradually get to the point where the bottle was ready. I was not impressed."
1,awful product,"I've used several bottle warmers and this one is by far the worst. It creates more hot spots than any other warmer I've used, sometimes doesn't stop the warming cycle, has no audible indicator when the cycle is complete. I accidentally spilled some milk in it (less than a tablespoon) and now there is this burnt on residue on the warming element that will not go away, even after multiple cleanings. Its not even worth giving to goodwill."
2,never the right temp,"Sure, it comes with specific directions and a handy tool to use to add just the right amount of water to heat a specific size bottle, but it's never right. Following the directions, the bottle is never even close to being warm enough. Add more water, and it is too hot--and baby is still hungry!!!"
1,Not worth the hassle,"This product is #1 on my ""waste of money"" list of baby products. The instructions for use are complicated and use a table based on the size of the bottle, rather than the amount of liquid in the bottle that you are trying to warm. This leads to confusion -- for example, how much heating water do you use to warm a wide-mouthed 9 ounce bottle with only 4 ounces of milk in it? The instructions provide no guidance for this common situation. Consequently, I have never felt that the bottles were warmed to the right temperature -- they either felt too cold or got way too hot.I recommend to anyone needing to warm a bottle to sit it in a mug of hot water from the tap for a couple minutes and avoid the hassle and guesswork of this product."
4,I love this warmer,"We registered for this warmer, and I am glad we did. At first it was a little hard to figure out how much water to put in, but now that we have the hang of it, it works like a charm. Of course occasionally one bottle is warmer than the next, but it all depends on how cold or warm the bottle was to begin with, not to mention there is no way you can get the EXACT amount of water in the warmer each time (especially in the middle of the night!)What I like the most is that this warmer is quick. In the middle of the night, I start the bottle in the warmer, change my son's diaper and by the time I am done it's ready to go. We have tried other warmers and they take too long.I would, and have, recommended this warmer to others!"
3,"Trial and error, but at least it's fast.","I'm lucky my daughter will take a bottle anywhere between room temp and body temp; yes, it doesn't heat the same, but after trial and error, I found that if I fill up an Avent bottle w/ 4oz. of refrigerated milk, fill up the measuring cup half-way, it will usually heat it up close enough for her, but you gotta mix it well and test it, especially if you don't take it out right away. My daughter is quite impatient when she's hungry, so the fact that it's the fastest and most convenient way to heat milk is why I would buy it again."
4,I love it but...,"I love this warmer but it doesn't always warm it ""just"" right. You need to know how much water to add. It is a learning process. My husband does better than I do, but as long as it is not ice cold I am happy. If it is too warm, of course, I let it cool down first. That is not fun though, waiting for the bottle to cool down when you have a screaming child. I would hate to see what would happen though if I gave it to him just a bit too warm. Some things are worth waiting for."
2,Wouldn't Purchase Again!!!,"I used this warmer for the first month of having my son. I found it to be really inconvenient. It would either get tooooooooo HOT or wouldn't warm the bottle enough. When you have a hungry, screaming baby at 3 a.m. you want something that is convenient and this warmer is not. I took it to sell at consignment last week. I hope the next person to buy it has better luck with it than I did!"
3,Great to use except if you have Dr. Browns bottles,"The bottle warmer was sensational when we used it with our Avent bottles; however, when we switched to Dr. Browns bottles because our baby had colic, the warmer did not fit these bottles. Since the bottle did not fit in the warmer, the milk, when heated, overflowed producing a heinous smell and quite a significant cleanup job. From everything that I have researched, Dr. Browns bottles do not recommend certain bottle warmers so please send any recommendations you have for those of us who are die hard Dr. Browns customers."
4,It works for us,"I got this soon after my daughter was born but I didn't start using it until last week. Our daughter who is otherwise a very good sleeper, just couldn't get out of her 4am bottle routine so I decided to start trying out giving her a warm bottle right before bed. It worked like a charm. She was pretty happy with her room temperature milk for a while but nothing beats a warm bottle.This bottle warmner works to a T. It heats the bottle to just the right temperature and is pretty easy to work."
2,First Years? Didn't even last 9 months...,"We were generally happy with this product, until it stopped working. You have to use it with distilled water, not tap, otherwise you have to clean it daily with vinegar because of the mineral build-up. This morning, it just stopped working. After just 8 months of use, a few months before we would have otherwise retired it. We are frustrated as we are so close to weaning off the bottle that we don't want to buy another bottle warmer & certainly wouldn't buy this one again. It is very compact."
3,"Good product idea, not very accurate heating","Overall, this is a lifesaver. It is a great product, but the little measuring cup provided is difficult to fill up to the right line (which are really close together) and too little or too much water tends to over/underheat the bottle. But this saves time over boiling and is healthier/safer than microwaving. Gave it a 3 because it has it's ups, but it's downs become irritating when you use it 5-7 times daily!"
1,Very disappointing,"This products mechanism is so disappointing and poor. It is basically an electric water heater and when the water boils and lets of steam, the steam warms the milk, whicch is an okay idea, if the quality of the heater was better and it didn't take so long. The heating is uneven and did I mentions takes a very long. Easier to fill a bowl with warm water fronm the tap and put the bottle in it...easier and faster"
3,good for the price,"I have this warmer and it pretty much does what its supposed to for the price. It does tend to overheat smaller bottles but you just have to get the hang of the amount of water you need to use. I'm not crazy about how it heats larger bottles...it seems I have to press the button a couple of times before I get it right. But, again, there aren't many choices out there and it does heat faster then other traditional methods."
2,"wow, best baby shower gift.","I brought this gift for my son and his wife; their daughter was born on 2/21/07. when I questioned them as to why they had not used the bottle warmer, they just didn't get around to using it. I insisted they read the directions and start using it. the next day, my son stated. wow mom this is the best baby shower gift. they could not believe how fast the bottle warmer worked. how much timed it saved them as new parents, and the milk was heated at just the right temperature each time. my son was so thankful, that I insisted he use the product."
1,Get the Better One,"I bought this warmer because it was the better priced one. However, it only worked a few times. When it did work, it wasn't very well at that. I returned it for a more expensive warmer and and it works great! Spend the few extra $$$ for the better warmer. You don't want to get stuck at 2 a.m. with a warmer that doesn't work!"
3,Save your money,I have tried 3 different bottle warmers. This one is the 2nd best. It DOES allow the bottle to overheat and when your little one is demanding food - NOW - it is inconvenient to wait 10-15 minutes for it to cool down. When I used this I stood beside it and tested the temperature of the formula about every 3 minutes or so. Major pain since I like to change my baby while his bottle is warming. If you absolutely have to have a bottle warmer - the Baby Tec by One Step Ahead is MUCH better!!!
1,"Milk is either too cold or too hot, rarely just right","I still use this product, but I seldom add the rightamount of water to get the desired temperature. I usuallyend up over-heating milk then have to wait for it to cool.i wish I had shopped around for this product."
1,not a good product,"I recieved this warmer as gift and I hate it. It over heats my Avent botles and under heats my disposables. You have to stand there and keep checking the temp of the bottle even after using the suggested amount of water, it's just not consistant. Be careful removing the bottle my Avent bottles get so hot I have burnt my hand several times. I will be tring the Avent warmer instead."
1,Unreliable,"We purchased this warmer to reheat breastmilk and ready to feed formula. The temperature was very inconsistent, sometimes too warm, sometimes barely warm at all. It also continues to heat even after the warmer shuts off. If you aren't there to immediately remove the bottle it overheats. Of all my many purchases for our first baby I was most dissapointed in this unit."
5,very helpfull to warm breastmilk,very good it works very well to warm breastmilk.yes i would reccomand this product .very handy I can take wherever I go.
1,Piece of Junk,"This bottle warmer broke after the first week. It takes FOREVER to warm the bottles and then it doesn't even warm them. I'm trying to get a refund right now. Also, the opening is too small for the newer bottles (TippeTommy, comotomo, etc)."
4,must have!,"This product is easy to use, heats up the bottle quickly, and compact compared to other bottle warmers. The only reson I did not give it 5 stars is because I cannot figure out the amount of water to add for a perfectly heated bottle. Overall a must have!"
3,"OK, but actually not good","I liked the idea that the light on the warmer would show you if it was ready or not, but the warmer does not work properly, after a couple of weeks it just stopped working, I got another one and I realized it was not warming the milk like it should, so I returned it and I got the Avent Bottle Warmer, which is better quality but slow and hard to function."
4,Good for the price,Works quickly and bottles are at perfect temp. Hint: when warming a 8 or 9oz bottle. fill the cup twice. Doesn't take up a lot of space.
2,To hard to get the bottle warmed just right!,"If you don't get the water level right you end up with a to cold or warm of a bottle. If it's to cold you can't reheat it for at least 5-10 minutes, and at 3am it[s] really [bad]. It is nice cause it shuts off automatically , but if you don't have evrything just right it won't work right."
2,Hated it!,"I actually returned my bottle warmer. I too used the Playtex Disposables with my warmer, but found that the warmer was not consistent. Sometimes the milk would be too warm (almost hot), other times not warm enough. What drove me to return the warmer were the times when the bottles were not warm enough. There's a delay (approximately 2 minutes) which requires you to wait and allow the unit to cool before turning it on again. This wait was miserable for both me and the baby. Not sure if I had a defective warmer or what. Now I use traditional methods of warming bottles and it's actually not so bad."
3,So-so so hot or too cold,If you are constantly standing over the bottle warmer testing it you will be fine....turn your head for a second and you could have a very hot bottle...The water marks on the side measureer are not accurate you have to judge as you go for yourself and if on the first time it is not warm enough you have to wait ten minutes before starting a new one....Running water on the bottle takes same amount of time for me and i have a better feel when it is warm enough.
1,We quit using this bottle warmer,"After about 2 weeks, we quit using this bottle warmer. Either the bottle was still ice cold, or it was too hot. I found it easier and faster to warm a cup of water in the microwave and set the bottle in it while I changed the baby. I wish we had used the $18 for something else."
2,I'd say it's okay for the price,"I got this warmer as a shower gift. It does warm the bottle to the perfect temperature. It has drawbacks, though. I took us 6 minutes to heat up a bottle that we had in the fridge. It also developed some brown crusty looking stuff in the bottom of it, and all the numbers rubbed off the measuring tube. We barely even use it anymore because it it not too convenient when you have a hungry baby waiting for her bottle."
3,Hmmmmmm,"I really like the convenience of the bottle warmer . . . the fact that it takes any kind of bottle . . . size, shape, etc. The only problem that we are having is it is not consistent in heating the bottle. Sometimes the bottle is VERY hot and sometimes it is VERY cold. We use the same amount of water, but it varies. So . . . we will continue trying and may have to replace it. Otherwise, it is very easy and convenient!"
1,boiled formula!,"I have been through two of these. The first one seemed okay for a few weeks, until I discovered that with Dr. Browns bottles, the upper half of the formula was warm, but formula in the bottom half of the bottle was cold. One day I put a bottle and turned around to make cereal. I noticed it was taking longer than usual so I checked it and found that all the formula had leaked out into the unit, and it was burned. I had to throw it out, since the indicator light never went off after that. I got a second one, and was using Avent bottles. Same thing. It was in there for so long that it pretty much exploded and our kitchen smelled like burned formula for days. THis just does not heat evenly and is dangerous, in my opinion."
3,OK. Just OK.,"This product gets the job done in that it heats the bottle. Unfortunately, it relies on how much water you put in, not a sensor. Since the water levels only have to vary slightly to change the temperature dramatically, I usually find myself just testing the water on my wrist at intervals, the same thing I did with a pot and steamer basket. Probably should have just stuck with that.On the upside, it's streamlined, looks good in our kitchen, and travels well."
2,More of a hassle than help,"I bought this item for my first baby. To make a long story short, despite following directions very carefully, half the time the bottle either came out too hot, or still cold. I gave it up quick and ended up setting the bottle in a bowl of warm water from the microwave. Takes a little longer, but works everytime and it's not as annoying."
4,Very helpful,"The product was good and served its prupose.. At times there would be a leak from the bottle, I guess this was because we left it a little longer in there.. Easy to clean and used it well the initial 4 months of my newborn."
4,"Works well, but tricky to use at first","This warms relatively quickly, and very evenly. It was very confusing at first to figure out how it worked. You have to pour a measured amount of water into it, and as that heats up it creates steam and heats the bottle. I had originally ordered this to scald milk, but it does not work well for that at all."
1,waste of money,"I read the reviews for this and was excited to use it - I've read the instructions many times, tried adjusting per their specifications, and after approximately 20 attempts I have given up. I've gone so far as to try every water level option, and never ended up with a warm bottle. If you do purchase this warmer, don't throw away the box until you are sure it works.."
2,Boils Bottles,"This bottle warmer is going right back.Instructions are careless, not detailed and left us wondering if we're using the product correctly and safely. Just goes to show that not a lot of thought was put into the creation of this product.Tried it first with ""7 units"" of water as the instructions suggested, that resulted in boiled milk within a few minutes. Tried it again after waiting for cool down with 4 units of water, once again boiled an equivalent amount of milk... The amount of water doesn't seem to make a difference, and the warmer heats up the milk way too much to the point of boiling it. So what is this thing good for?"
2,Very unpredictable!,"Like other reviewers, I have had nothing but problems with this thing! The instructions for how much water to add are not right at all. You have to figure out on your own how much water to use, and then, you can do the exact same thing twice and one time will still be ice cold and the other time burning hot. There is a little ring piece, which is not attached, and if you lose it, the thing does not work AT ALL since all the steam just escapes! Ours stopped heating consistently after two months of use. It gets a brown build-up in the bottom, and you can not fit your hand in there to clean it out. The instructions say to wipe with vinegar periodically, which I have found you actually have to do every day or else you will never get the build up out. We are switching to Munchkin brand bottle warmer now that this one has quit working."
2,Its ok.,I got it for a road trip. I have a port as an outlet in my car. It doesn't heat that fast I had to put in an extra bottle to heat up the water to heat up the bottle. I did this after 10 minutes of trying it the way the directions said to. My way still took another 10 minutes. It will get you threw what you need to do... But its not as great as everyone say... maybe I just got a defective one. But its not something I would buy again....
3,"It is not a warmer, it is a boiler","Your baby wont drink the milk after using this warmer, it is too hot!waste money. It is not a warmer, it is a boiler!"
2,"Heating bottles is a must, but this warmer is a bust...","My husband bought this warmer from one of the chain baby stores and I was really excited to use it. We wanted a reliable warmer for the transition from breast to bottle for our son. Well, it warms the bottle great, just not the milk! I use this multiple times a day, and I still don't have it down. I have tried everything from smaller bottles to more water to warming the bottle twice. I almost always end up with a bottle that is hot and milk that is not. Of course, by the time I get the temperature right, my poor son is sobbing and thinks I have deserted him.... I have learned to avoid this awful feeling by setting up the warmer just before he wakes from his naps (he is still breastfeeding at night) and adjusted it accordingly. I have to say, this takes all of the convenience out of the warmer. I am sure there is a better warmer out there, I just haven't brought myself to purchasing one for fear of the same results..."
1,Doesn't usually work,"This warmer works when it wants to which means only when i'm testing it and never when I need to warm a bottle at 3 am! I'll plug it in and nothing happens. I already threw away the box, so i'm hoping Amazon will still let me return it! I'll be trying a different brand all together."
1,Not a Good Product-Very Disappointing,"I breastfed when my infant was newborn, but because of his prematurity, we supplemented with bottles so decided to invest a warmer. He's now stricly on bottles and we've never been able to to get good results with this product. It seems to either be too hot or not even heated at all. Don't waste your money on this product whether you'll be using it frequently or just sometimes."
2,Difficult to use,"I am a breastfeeder. But, every now and again, my husband gives our baby a bottle of breastmilk. We are past the point of sleep deprivation, so I don't blame the use of this product on not enough sleep - it really is very confusing to use.The directions are quite unclear and the chart used to tell you how much water to put in is even more unclear. Several times, we have put too much water in, and the bottle gets way too hot, which is dangerous!This is only my opinion and I do not believe has anything to do with lack of intelligence."
1,don't bother with this one!!!!,"I would not tell anyone about this bottle warmer. It leaves the bottle cold, my child would not even take it. and you cant rewarm for at least 10 min. we bought it for a trip and returned it before we even left... We went with another product. LESS IS NOT ALWAYS BEST!!!!!"
2,The worst warmer ever!,"I've had this bottle wormer for about 4 months and I still can't get it right! The little measuring cup is not only hard to read, but also very inaccurate resulting in overheated or underheated bottles ALL THE TIME. To make things worse, once you warm up a bottle, if it's not right you have to wait 10 minutes before you can try again. Try telling a screaming, hungry baby that he/she has to wait 10 minutes to eat!!!!"
4,Good bottle warmer,I have 2 bottle warmers and this one is by far the faster and easier to use. It's a good basic bottle warmer.
3,It's Okay,"This warmer works but isn't the greatest. I hate that you have to wait 5-10 minutes to use it if the bottle doesn't get warm enough through the process. It is hard to find the amount of water to add. I don't even try anymore, I just put in 2 vials of water and keep checking the bottle. I put on the bottle while changing my little ones diaper. It usually takes 5-7 minutes for a 4-5 ounce bottle to warm. Guess when the little ones gets up to 8 ounces I'll add 3 vials of water.One great feature is the auto shutoff.This product could be improved but it sure beats heating the bottles by submerging in hot water."
1,Forget it!!!,"Do not even bother with this product! This warmer doesn't warm refridgerated bottles! My 2 week old is taking 4 oz. bottles and THEY will not even warm. After I use it I have to put the bottle in a cup ...butt! If I could just rewarm it that would help, but it won't let you do that for like 10 minutes....and adding more water doesn't help either. I can just imagine how frustrated I would be in a few more weeks when my son will be taking 8 oz. bottles! This was a waste of money and I will definitely be trying something else."
2,Quirky,"When it worked, it was great. But more often than not, it would either not heat the bottle at all, or the milk would be scalding. Not sure why - faulty heater? The indicator marks on the water vial came of quickly so we needed to mark the line with a permanent marker. Again, not ideal. I would recommend reading more reviews to see if this is just a quirky defect or common for the product."
4,Very good bottle warmer,"I don't use a whole bunch of bottles since I nurse, but occasionally I thaw out some breast milk for when my daughter and I are going to be out in very public places for a long period of time. This works great. I just put the milk in the warmer and in about four minutes it is done. Sometimes however, when I have a 7 ounce pack it takes a few times through it to get it all the way warmed. Since I am using this for when I am out it isn't a big deal that it takes awhile, especially because you have to wait for the warmer to cool all the way down before you can use it again. However, when I use it to heat milk from the frig so my husband can feed her, it works great. I wouldn't suggest walking away from it because sometimes it gets too hot when the whole four minutes is given to heat. Walking away while heating a bottle is not wise anyway, so it really isn't a problem standing there for it and it is a whole lot quicker than boiling water."
1,"Was great at first, but after 2 months, it's terrible","It requires CONSTANT watching. If I don't take the milk out and shake the bottle at least twice while heating, it scalds the milk giving it a terrible taste. I hate having to throw out breastmilk! Grrrr.The bottom of the inside where the bottle rests is getting all rusty looking, even though I've kept it clean. Makes it smell bad when the machine heats up.I have two of these, and both are having the same problems. I guess I got what I paid for."
3,Works pretty good,"We use this for breastmilk in Avent bottles, and it works OK --but don't follow the directions on the back. For a refrigerated 4 oz. bottle, we need to fill the measuring dispenser past 10, leave it in for the full time, and then it is warmed to room temperature. It works well for being an inexpensive warmer."
3,its a good thing to have but you have to experiment w/ it,"babies love warm food and a warm bottle, like warm milk is verysoothing.this is a decent warmer. it takes the chill off a bootle that is fresh (and cold) from the fridge.the good news: this warmer works well w/ any bottle system. you can put your bottle - fresh from the fridge - into the warmer, start it, change your baby, and then feed (in my case) her a nicely warmed bottlethe bad news: it takes a bit of experimentation to find the right amount of water to have the bottle turn out just right; too much and the bottle is too hot (and you have to cool it down in the sink) too little: and its not warm enough."
5,Another Must-Have Product,"For the first week, we warmed bottles in tap water. It was time consuming and inconvenient. Not to mention that half-full Avent bottles float so you have to hold it in the cup/bowl of water the entire time. This product warms up bottles in minutes and it is so easy to use. It has a little thing on that side that slides off so you can add the water to that and dump it in. (You can use more or less water depending on the size of the bottle and the amount of ""warming"" needed with very little effort.) It heats to a perfect level each time. When it is through, it shuts itself off so you don't have to remember to do it yourself.The only problem is that the inside has turned a little brown from the heat (burned-like) but since it hasn't affected anything, it doesn't seem to matter."
2,Not the best out there,"We were disappointed with this bottle warmer for our twin boys. We found that it can only heat up one bottle every 10 minutes, which is a real problem when you are trying to heat up two bottles or you mess up the first time, and its too cold or too hot, which is common with this warmer because you are constantly adjusting how much water to put in. At 3AM, this is just too much trouble. Also, it lacks a countdown timer, a memory for how long you needed the warmer the last time, and doesn't have a water reservoir. The Dr. Browns is much better, and we have found that one works great for Dr. Browns, First Years and Playtex bottles."
4,Good bottle warmer with simple and easy to use.,This bottle warmer helped me and my wife a lot for feeding our twins.It is easy simple and easy to use. It warmed up a milk bottle pretty fast actually but felt really long since twins were always crying for milk.If you tried to use it 3-4 times and you will know how much water you need to put for your bottle with water measuring cup. You have to clean the warmer regularly otherwise there will be some stuff in the bottle warmer.It lasted exactly 12 months for us. It only has 90 days limited warranty. Good product for the money.
3,Has ups and downs,"This product is nice to have if your child is picky about warm formula or milk. However, you need to be cautios when serving the bottle. They tend to overheat the formula and any condensation on the bottle can burn your child."
1,Ahhhhhh!,"I hated this warmer!!!! I would put the exact same amount of water in for the same amount of formula. One time it would be too hot, another too cool, and another just right. Sometimes the warmer wouldn't even heat away all of the water! Then, somehow water got into the base, there must be a crack in a seal, and brown water would drip onto my counter. It was awful."
1,do you really need this product?,"I received this bottle warmer for my shower. My daughter is a breastfed baby and when it came time for me to go back to work at 4 months I took this out and read the directions. It seems to me that 5 minutes is a long time for an item specially designed to warm up bottles. It takes that long to heat up a bottle in a big pot of water! My daughter is still breastfeeding at 6 months and only receives 3-4 bottles a week so a bottle warmer is definately not a priority. We warm up bottles and baby food the old fashioned way, in a big pot of hot water."
2,Very inconsistent,"I too am disappointed with this warmer. It is very inconsistent in heating the bottles. Although we use the same amount of water in the warmer each time, the bottle never comes out the same. Sometimes it's just right, but more often it is over or under heated. The enclosed booklet tells how much water should be added for each bottle type and size. It is grossly off. We basically fill the measuring tube full for a 6 oz bottle and heat with the lid off so we can stick our (clean) finger in ever few seconds to test and make sure it isn't overheating. As another review mentioned, it's extremely frustrating when it doesn't heat the bottle enough because it takes 10 minutes to cool down before you can rewarm. Don't waste your money."
2,very disappointed,"Thought this was the greatest thing the first time I used it, but as other people have written, it is very inconsistant when warming bottles, even though I fill it with the same amount of water every time, sometimes it is very cold, sometimes perfect. The other day though, I warmed up the bottle and thank goodness I always test it, I burned myself on the milk! I had to run cold water on the bottle to get it warm, because it was piping hot! I am returning the product."
3,"Quick, but hot","This warmer definitely works quickly, but with the bottles I use (Avent) the plastic ring gets extremely hot from the steam put out by this warmer. The actual temperature of the bottle itself is fine and has never been too hot, so it might just be the way it works with the design of Avent bottles."
3,Useful but inprecise,"It is very easy to use and functional.My complaint is that each bottle I warm may have different results, in some cases over heating in some others under heating."
1,Stopped working after 5 uses,"We have the First Years Day and Night Bottle Warmer (with the cooler on the back) for use upstairs, and loved it so much that I decided to order what I assumed to be the same item without the cooler for the kitchen counter downstairs. It never heated the bottles as well as the one that we had, and the bottles gradually got less and less warm, until the warmer didn't work at all. We used it less than ten times, and the entire thing totally crapped out. I ignored the bad reviews and really, really wanted to like this item because I love the cooler/bottle warmer so much! Back to Amazon it goes!"
2,Works great initially but then fails,I received two of these bottle warmers because I have twins. The warmers worked great for about 2-3 months then they went on the fritz. Even though we are very careful about filling the water container- bottles are either too cold or the warmer decides to drink the milk because by the time I go back to check on the bottle half of it is gone! I do NOT recommend this warmer. This is a perfect of example of you get what you pay for!
2,not good for thick bottom bottles,my daughter uses the mam bottles which have a very thick bottom and it takes 2 or 3 times to warm it. then sometimes its too warm....
2,worked okfor awhile,I bought this warmer because it was able to warm disposable liners. I could never get the right temperature it was either too hot or too cold and if it was too cold you couldn't reheat for another 5 or 10 mins. Explain that to a hungary 4 week old. It did finally break at 6 wks. I found that hot tap water was the best way after all. It gets the bottle just right in no time. I'm a new mother so i wanted every gadgit out there but it seems the old way is best for me.
5,Buy this!,If you are bottle feeding and want a warmer - this one can't be beat! Once you know how much water to use you'll never need to guess again. My son is 3 weeks old and I couldn't live without this. It's compact and never fails. I take it into my room at night so that I don't have to bother w/ the kitchen. The 3 am feeding is so quick and easy because of this warmer - look no further.
2,"For the Price, It's OK - If you want quality, this won't do","We like the of a bottle warmer and when we saw the price tag, we thought this was a great buy. The reality is that it's very hard to get ""the exact"" amount of water into the vial. Secondly, this ""exact amount"" does not adequately warm all bottles to the same temperature. I have since given up measuring and simply put in a vial or more of water and then monitor the temp by using my finger. In some cases, the bottle warms very quickly, in other cases, it takes minutes and minutes. For baby #2, we are tossing this one and on the hunt for a better quality warmer. Until then, we are making do. In all = for the price, it's usable (albeit it's a pain), and does the job but not without some additional work and toying."
2,Not worth it,"I have found that this bottle warmer makes the bottle either too hot or not hot enough (even if you follow the directions on how much water to use) and you have to wait ten minutes to start the cycle over again - that is TOO long to wait when you have a screaming, hungey baby who needs to eat! It's easier (and cheaper) to run hot water over the bottle, it takes the same amount of time and you can control the temperature."
4,GREAT PRODUCT,I PURCHASED THIS WARMER AND THE FIRST YEARS NIGHT AND DAY BOTTLE WARMER FOR MY BEDROOM. SO FAR THEY WORK REALLY GREAT AT HEATING THE BOTTLES TO THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE. THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE IS THE NUMBERS RUBBED OFF THE WATER VILES AND WE HAD TO PUT THEM ON WITH A PERMANENT MARKER.
2,Too Cold or Too Hot,The bottle warmer does not heat bottles evenly. The bottles are either too cold or too hot. The bottle warmer has to cool down before it can be used again. If it did not heat the bottle enough then you have to wait before heating it again. Save your money. It is faster to boil water and then set the bottle in the water to warm.
4,Getting the bottle out can burn!,"This works great, and is super fast at heating up the bottles, but the only problem is that the bottles Im using (the breast flow 4oz) are short enough that pulling them out gets you steam burns on your fingers, and thats if you can grasp it! Doesn't matter if the cap is on or the nipple, the lip of the tops are just under the ridge of the warmer so it's hard to grasp."
1,Absolute garbage,"Water vial is a pain to accurately fillIt does not consistantly heat up the firmula, despite using the proper amount of water"
3,good (when it works),"Works good when I can get the button to push in, which was only half the time my first week with it. I called customer service and they were very helpful. They told me to send them the cord, and they will send me a new unit. For now, 2 stars for the warmer, plus 1 for customer service. Will re-review after new unit comes in."
1,Disappointment,"I was Disappointed with this product. It takes a really long time to get warm and never heats my breast milk properly. It was expensive compared to the munchkin warmer but, not a better product."
1,don't like it very much,"It don't make the bottle warm enough, and as soon as it is warm it shuts off and you can't turn it back on. Not happy with my purchase."
1,I sent it back!,I followed the manufacture's instructions and tried about 10 times to heat bottles and not a single one of them even got warm. I find it much easier (and cheaper) to warm a cup of water in the microwave and place the bottle in it.
3,Okay product,"It's hard to figure out the right amount of water to use, even when referring to the product's instruction, when trying to warm-up a bottle. I use it regularly, though, and am satisfied if it at least takes off the cold edge of a breast milk bottle that's been refrigerated. It's easy-to-use, other than the aforementioned problem, and doesn't take up a lot of space. Since I have twins, I wish they would make these with two sides or not require the 10 minutes between each use (even though I mostly ignore that and add more water just before the light goes out)."
3,It does the job..,"It gets the job done, takes a little while and the amount of water specified to put in the warmer in the instructions to heat up the bottle isnt at all accurate so u gotta do a couple test runs.."
2,Hard to use,"Good concept, poor execution. Hard to use, and the instruction manuals suggested water amounts are way off base, in my experience. Wife and I got so frustrated with the warmer's inconsistent results that we've gone back to the old fashioned warming method - setting the bottle in a cup of warm water. That method works much better. The bottle warmer concept is solid and attractive, but this particular model fails. Do not buy."
4,Have to put water in each time. Flash steams.,"Maybe I didn't read carefully enough but I thought the bottle would sit in a few inches of water that would heat it up, and that the little tube on the side indicated the water level so you'd know when more water needed to be added occasionally. Wrong. You use the tube as a measuring cup to measure the proper amount of water to put in for what you're heating. (There's a table on the back that tells you.) The more water you use, the more heat it provides because it all turns to steam which heats the bottle. Makes sense that this way might be faster, I guess, but it's not quite as convenient as I expected, especially since I've found that I have to do the process twice to get a refrigerated bottle warm enough. Still, I like it. It's better that how we were heating bottles before (in a cup of hot water), and for the low price, worth it. Says colors vary. The one we received is exactly the same aqua and white as the picture."
2,Unreliable heating,"I've been using this warmer for 3 and half months now and it just seem to get more unreliable each week. I haven't changed bottles or adjusted the water levels, so I don't know why the heating temperature changes so much. More often I find that I have to heat my bottle twice in order to get lukewarm formula, otherwise the formula is cold but the bottle is hot. It's very deceiving...you must check the temperature of the fluid not the bottle to see if it is fit for feeding."
4,You have to wait 10 minutes before using it again.,"My daughter has twins. She was warming their bottles using tap water. It was taking too long to get hot and she felt like she was wasting a lot of water (we are in a drought). I looked at all the warmers and their reviews and decided to get this one. There is one that warms 2 bottles, but I wasn't impressed with the reviews. My daughter said this one is pretty fast. Her only complaint was the directions say to let it cool off for 10 minutes before using it again. Baby #2 doesn't always want to wait another 10 minutes. My solution was to send her a second one, even though I know her hubby will complain about having more stuff. At least they aren't a huge investment."
3,Good - but unpredictable,"Like the other reviewers have said - the warming time and amount of water it takes to warm the bottle vary from use to use.However, it's small, easy to clean and shuts itself off so there's no fear of starting a fire, or having a child touch it and get burned."
4,Very good warmer- just be careful with the water,"I really like this warmer but the full water level is for 8 oz. bottle. My son is only 5 weeks so we are heating 5-6 oz. at a time so you have to guess on the water. I overheated the first few trying to get it right. After that, very consistant heating. Also, very quick- for the amount I am heating to room temp it takes about 3 minutes."
1,Not impressed,"I purchased this bottle warmer because of the automatic shut-off. I already had a Gerber bottle warmer which works great for heating, but the only way to turn it off was to unplug it. I am too afraid to forget it and have it burn so I wanted something with a safety feature. Let me tell you, I am not impressed. I really only need my bottles heated to room temperature, but we recently had to switch to liquid formula so once it's refrigerated it's too cold. I can't even get it that hot & I fill the water cup to the max! The scary part of that is I'm only using 4oz bottles right now. I can't even imagine once he starts eating more. Of course, I can't continue heating once it shuts off because of the 10 minute cooling off period so I end up having to use my Gerber one anyway. It's a terrible product and I will be returning it. It's too much hassle to have a screaming baby wait for food while I fight with this thing."
4,Love this product!!!,"I love this product so much that I bought another one for my mom's house. I use it to heat up my 4oz medela and healthflow bottles and tried the Avents bottles. Yes the milk does get hot if you leave it til the warmer shuts off. But I usually check the bottle 1/2 way through the time (est. 3-4min), shake the bottle and the milk is PERFECT!!!!! Therefore it takes a total of 3-4 minutes for you to have a warm bottle, much quicker than putting it in boiling water. 2 other good things about this warmer are: 1)it has the auto shut-off capability unlike other warmers, where you have to unplug the unit and 2)it is small and doesn't take up too much space on your countertop."
4,"effective, but don't go far while heating","I found this bottle warmer very effective for the price, as long as you monitor the temperature closely. My daughter is almost 3 months old now and I use this warmer every night to heat my breat milk. It heats much faster than running hot water over the bottle. I can heat one of my daughters bottles, directly from the fridge, (3-4 ounces) in about 1 minute. This is a great feature when your baby is screaming to eat and you're half asleep. The only draw back is that I have to stand over the heater and periodically take the bottle out and check the temperature - but not a big deal when it only takes about 60 seconds. In almost 3 months, I've only overheated 1 bottle. This has been a life saver with those middle of the night feedings."
1,Terrible,"There are one of two things that happen when we use this product, either the milk is ice cold or scalding hot. We've owned this product for over a month and I can count on one hand the number of times it has worked correctly. We've gone back to using a cup of hot water to warm up our bottles, because this product is a complete LEMON."
4,The only recommended bottle warmer.,"From what I had reviewed this is the only bottle warmer that shuts off on its own. You put the specified amount of water in and when it warms up the bottle, it shuts itself off. This factor definitely comes in handy especially if you get too busy with baby that you forget to turn it off.The only bad thing about this product is the measuring device. After many times of picking it up and getting it wet, the numbers and lines on the measuring device start to disappear. My solution to this was taking a permanent marker and marking the lines that I used most and then updating the black line when it would start to fade."
2,Very inaccurate!,"I breastfeed my baby and my husband gives him one bottle at night. We have used this warmer for the past 4 months and find it very unreliable in heating the bottles to a consistant temperature. Using the same bottle, same amount of liquid in the bottle, same temperature (from fridge) and same amount of water in measuring device....it would always be a surprise what the outcome would be. You have to start with a full tube of water and usually you have to run it again with a half a tube. Sometimes, it's even too hot with the first full tube. In a nutshell, this is quicker than sitting the bottle in hot water, BUT it needs monitoring. Next time, I will get another brand and do more research before buying."
1,Does not heat up refrigerated bottles,"Will not heat up refrigerated bottles, a total waste of money and time."
1,Hated It!,"I received this as a shower gift and after trying to ""guess"" how much water to use with each bottle I ended up returning it. The outside of the bottle would be quite warm but once you shake the contents, everything was cold. Not worth the money at all."
1,I would never recommend this!!,I can never get a consistent temperature with this warmer. I have tried all different water levels and have YET to get the perfect temp. I'm really not happy at all with this warmer and I would never recommend this to anyone.
1,not a great product,"I would save my money and use the microwave instead. This bottle warmer took too long ,and it was either too cold or too hot .I recommend using the microwave ,and shaking the bottle good, and then testing it on your wrist.I ended up taking it back and buying a different one."
2,Warms the bottom,"The concept of using steam to warm the bottle is poor and does not work properly. It seems quick but only the outside and the bottom portion of the milk or baby food is heated. This does not work properly to heat up 8 oz of milk or a baby food jar.Another poor design is that the electrical cord to this device is exremely short.A missing feature is that this does not keep your baby food warm after heating. Spend a few more dollar to one that heats up the water, not using the steam. It may take longer but your baby will appreciate his/her warm milk or food!"
1,dangerous product,"I burned the h..eck out of my finger the first night I used this. It totally overheats the milk..to the boiling point, which shouldn't then be consumed by the baby,even when cooled down. I'm back to the stove top ."
1,Not at all useful or up to par,"I bought this in hopes that I could avoid standing over a pot of boiling water in the middle of the night to heat my newborn's bottle. She is impatient when it comes to waiting so I thought this little unit would do the trick. NO SUCH LUCK. The product review says it's stylish but who cares? What we really need is functionality and usability and this warmer is neither. It claims to heat up the bottle in 4 minutes but the milk is unevenly heated, the top of the bottle is cold and the base is scalding. The milk then needs to be shaken to even out the temperature...a real time sucker when you're in a hurry to feed a wailing baby. I tried to vary the amount of water I poured into the heating base but this didn't help. I'm lucky I didn't throw away my trusty little pot since I'm back to warming up the old fashioned way on the stove."
2,toooo hot or cold,"I agree with the other lady who said you have to sit and wait for the bottle to warm up. I went through, in total, about 4 bottles that became scalded before I gave up on this thing. The opposite was also true. I would put just the right amount of water ina and the bottle itself got warm but the milk was just as cold as when I took it out of the fridge. And you can't just hit the button again to reheat because, I guess, there is some kind of thermostat thing in it. Therefore, you end up running hot tap water over the bottle anyway. Now I just fill a quart size Chinese soup container with hot water and put the bottle in there for about 2 minutes and it is good. No more scalded bottles or cold bottles."
2,Does not work with glass bottles or bigger food containers,"Website said glass bottle should not be used. We have glass bottles, so we could not use it as bottle warmer.Website said it can warm jar of baby food, but we make our own baby food, and our containers could not fit it.We returned ths bottle warmer. On the other hand, we love the sterilizer, which I will write about next.The First Years Babypro Sterilizer."
2,Not as easy as it seems,"I disliked the fact that a little too much or too little water required another try. Yes, it warms up the bottle very quickly but it can over do it fairly easily. We found it easier to warm the bottles just by placing them in a cup of hot water. I'd skip this item."
5,This warmer is the only one to have,"I love this warmer. We use disposable bottles and I love that this is specially sized for them. It also has a special little ""lifter"" to warm jarred baby foods too. You do have to play around with the water to get it set right. But i just stay with it and test the bottle. I recommend this to all moms who warm their bottles."
5,Quick and easy,"This bottle warmer works wonders for my little one. At first i had a hard time trying to figure out the right amount of water to put into the little blue tube, but once I finally figured out the measured amount I was very pleased. The warmer works under 5 minutes for even an 8 oz. bottle. It is faster than boiling water or sitting a bottle in a tall glass of hot water. When babies are crying they want to be fed fast and this gets the job done!"
2,Inconsistent,"I'm surprised by all the positive reviews. I use this maybe once or twice a week since I am home breastfeeding, but I still find it annoying. At first, figuring out the test tube water amount is confusing, and even then when you warm the bottle, it doesn't always heat it all the way through. If you want to warm it again, or if you want to warm another one, you can't because it just won't turn on until it completely cools down (which is a long time). I am assuming it is a safety feature so it doesn't overheat the milk/formula. I just find that putting the bottle in a mug of hot water is easier.Maybe if I was using it for every feeding, I'd be used to it and like it. I think it sucks."
3,You could do better,"The instructions for how much water to use are confusing. When the bottle is done warming, the light just turns off. An audible notification would be great, especially considering you may be tending to baby in another room while the bottle is warming. Also, it has damaged to bottom of my similar bottles, crazing the plastic. If would not buy again, look for something better."
1,Annoying,I ordered this product to be shipped to Australia but it shouldn't have been available to order because I needed an inverter to make it work because of the difference in AC and that costs more than the product itself!
2,Consistent? I WISH!,"I should've listened to the negative reviews on this item - it does not warm up my Playtex Drop In bottles consistently no matter how many times I try!!! I experimented with the amount of water to put in it and I still can't get this warmer to work right the first time, every time. It has turned out to be a waste of money - just placing a bottle in warm water works better."
3,Decent Pick,It's a good and cheaper pick. Serves the purpose fine have used so far to heat milk. However there is small accumulation at the bottom.Can be bought.
1,Not a good product at all...,"I received this bottle warmer as a gift and have used it several times, with much dissatisfaction. It takes a long time to heat bottles and the heating itself is inconsistent. Sometimes the bottle will come out still cold and other times it will come out scalding hot...on the same setting. Also, the design of the bottle warmer is just stupid. The power button is at the very bottom of the device and you have to push down on it rather than push in, which causes the warmer to tip over unless you are holding it with the other hand. I can't tell you how many times I've had my baby in one hand and ended up tipping the whole bottle warmer over, spilling milk and water everywhere, and when you have a screaming hungry baby in your arms, the last thing you want is to clean up a big mess and start all over. Needless to say, I'll be tossing this bottle warmer and buying another one."
3,"Works fine, but we didn't end up needing it....","We got this as a shower gift and used it for about a week before we realized that our infant daughter didn't notice one bit whether we heated up the bottles or just served them at room temperature. (We discovered this by taking her out and just putting the formula in a bottle and giving it to her without heating it....she never noticed a thing.) Since then we've been too lazy to heat up the bottles. Basically, when my daughter is crying because she's getting hungry, it's much faster to just give her a room temperature bottle than have her work herself into a fit of crying waiting for a heated bottle."
1,waste of money,"When our daughter was born, the only thing that we didn't already have was a bottle warmer. The instructions to this one seemed simple enough, but after trying for over two months, I did not get 1 bottle heated correctly. They were all either too hot or too cold even if I added the same amount of water, the bottle temperature was different evey time. There is nothing worse then a hungry baby and you have to put her bottle on ice to let it cool before she can have it. Save your money and don't buy this product."
5,good deal,Works great. Handy to have one upstairs and one downstairs when the baby needs a warm bottle.Thanks for a great producrt
2,Doesn't Heat Breastflow Bottles,"I bought this warmer because I own the Breastflow bottles and I was thinking that since the two products are made by the same company, it should work. Well, I was disappointed because it failed to warm the bottle at all! What is the point in make a bottle warmer when it doesn't even warm the bottles that are made by the same company?"
5,This Bottle Warmer is Great,"We just had our baby 3 months ago, and we started introducing the bottle at 2 months. I was having to wake up hearing the baby crying, then run downstairs, put a big coffee mug with water into the microwave, wait 3 minutes, take it out, put the bottle in coffee mug(spilling water everywhere), wait another 3-4 minutes constantly testing to see if its warm yet...all while the baby is screaming bloody murder. When we got the bottle warmer, it all changed. The baby would wake up crying, I'd run down stairs put the measured amount of water in the warmer as it comes with measuring cup that sticks to the side of the warmer(I had to put a little extra water in to get the milk to the correct temp), stick the bottle in it and turn it on. While it was warming I could go and console the baby in the meanwhile. So 2 things, it only took 3 min to warm the bottle and I could take care of the baby while it was warming...you need this thing!"
2,Slowly stops warming...,"This warmer was absolutely great in the beginning. When I was pregnant I was having nightmares about having to boil water on the stovetop everytime my Son would want a bottle. This warmer was given to me as a baby shower gift and I was thrilled. My husband and I have used it constantly since day one. Now that our Son is 9 1/2 months old it is not so predictable anymore. It seems that the more it is used the less accurate it becomes. I can make two bottles in the same day with the same amount of fluid in the bottle and in the warmer and one bottle will turn out piping hot and the other bottle will be ice cold. I am currently shopping for a new, different, bottle warmer to purchase."
2,Not as nifty as you would think,"We thought that the idea behind this bottle warmer was wonderful, especially with the automatic shutoff. However, we are completely frustrated with it. I have had it for three weeks and have yet to discover the correct amount of water to put in to accurately warm the bottles. They are almost always too hot or too cold, even when I put in the same amount of water for each bottle. I usually end up having to run the bottles under hot or cold water to get them to the desired temperature. Sometimes the old fashioned way beats all."
4,Wonderful product,"This is so much quicker than boiling water to heat refrigerated breastmilk. As the other reviews have said, the weak point is that is doesn't always heat the same way. You have to stay on top of it to make sure it doesn't shut off after 30 seconds or stay on too long and overheat the bottle. It is so convenient, user friendly, it fits the large Avent bottles that we like, it doesn't take up much space and it has auto shutoff. I highly recommend this time saving bottle warmer."
1,When does the bottle get warm?,I tried to use this bottle warmer three times and it took forever to heat up my doctor brown bottles- if it doesn't heat up the first time you need to wait about 5 minutes to try again!! I even tried the top line for the water and it still didn't heat up the bottle- I ended up returning the warmer and just use the stove!!
5,"WORKS VERY FAST , LOVE IT","THIS WARMER IS A NO BRAINER, THANK GOD, EASY FOR DAD TO USE , WARMS BOTTLE VERY FAST, GREAT FOR THE LATE NIGHT FEEDINGS, I BRING IT UPSTAIRS WITH ME AND THE BOTTLE IN A COOLER SO I CAN FEED HER FAST WITH NO FUSS. HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS WARMER a++++"
4,Not for the new mother...,I received this product at my baby shower. I read all the reviews and decided it would be a good thing to have. My daughter being a newborn only takes small amounts of formula and it can be difficult at times to figure out just how long to leave the bottle in the warner before giving it to her. it can either be too hot or too cool even when following the directions that come with it.
4,Good for disposibles,"I used this when I was first starting out bottlefeeding. The bottles (resusible) weren't getting enough heat, BUT when I decied to try the disposibles, it worked nice. SInce not alot of warmers alow disposibles, it worked great. All though I don;t use them anymore ( she likes diff bottles better) I plan to use it to heat up her baby food."
2,Inconsistent,"I've had problems with this product. It boiled my breastmilk a few times and other times it doesn't heat my milk enough. I'm almost afraid to use it... Every now and then I work up the nerve to use it, but I find myself babysitting it to make sure it doesn't boil my milk. I've tried using little water (the first line); then the second line... and it doesn't matter, my milk is either too hot or too cold!"
1,humm.....................,"This warmer is not that good. You have to put the exact measurment of water, or else the bottle will either come out too hot, or too cold."
5,I can't live without this!,"This is the third bottle warmer I have purchased (1 for car, 1 for emergencies & this one for the house) and this is by far the best style & brand. I love the fact that it shuts itself off after each use and if you follow the water fill line guides, you'll have great luck with temperatures. It's much more consistant than heating bottles in the microwave or via stovetop and much less of a hassle. I've purchased this model for friends as shower gifts as well and have heard no complaints."
3,Okay product for the price- just BE CAREFUL,"I bought this warmer right before my daughter Alicia was born. It does heat the bottle pretty well, but you have to use EXACTLY the right amount of water, or else it gets too hot. I always have to test before I give it to her, and I can honestly say that no two bottles have ever come out the same temperature. But it does come in handy at 2am, when it heats in less than 2 minutes :)"
3,Average product,Warms quickly though the timings are not consistent. Just have to keep a watch lest the bottle gets too warm
1,HORRIBLE!,"I bought two of these, and they both did the same thing. I followed the directions exactly, even called customer service, and with both warmers, the thing shut off before warming the bottles. The bottles were always ICE COLD. I would definitely not recommend this product."
1,save your money,"I bought this warmer to use with my second child and ended up returning it. It was very inconsistent with heating bottles of any size or type, and with any amount or type of formula. With all the time I wasted reheating or cooling bottles from this warmer it was really faster to just use hot tap water in a big plastic cup!"
2,"Doess what it says, but...","This thing kind of has two temperatures: ""Is it on?"" and ""Yosemite Sam who has just eaten hot sauce and is breathing fire."" And if it's too cold, you can't turn the product on for another 15 minutes or so while the machine cools down. And we all know how very patient babies are when they're hungry.It seems to me that the bottom gets very, VERY hot, and that when you mix it it becomes somewhat even. Doesn't that kind of kill the nutrient content, though? It's really not that much faster than heating a bottle in warm water from the tap, and it probably kills a lot of the antibodies in breastmilk.If you're using this to heat baby food or formula, go for it, but I'm pretty sure it destroys the nutritional content of breastmilk something fierce."
2,It either works or doesn't at all,"We were given this warmer, and beggars can't be choosers, but I would NEVER buy one of these on my own. There is absolutely no consistency with warming with this product. Sometimes the bottles come out perfect, but more often than not it's either still freezing cold or it's scalding hot. And when your baby is hungry in the middle of the night and you're trying to warm a bottle for feeding the last thing you want to do is try to heat it again or wait for it to cool down. Not to mention trying to fill the water vile with exactly the amount of water you need in the middle of the night can get real annoying. Save your money and buy one you can rely on."
2,Useless warmer,You can never get the exact amount of water to go in there. Sometimes it over heats and sometimes it is not warm for the same amount of milk in the bottle. Once it was made the milk so hot that my son would have burnt his mouth if I had not taken the care to check the temperature several times before I could feed him. I used the recommended amount of water and still it overheated the milk. Since then I have stopped using it so that I do not risk burning his mouth.
3,Pretty good warmer,"I like the warmer well enough- as other reviews have noted, the water measurement is not very accurate, so I find myself using a little less water than I think I need so the bottle ends up cool or room temperature instead of warm. Not a big deal. My biggest problem with it is that the bottom heating plate is very hard to keep clean (my bottles leak formula sometimes). Be aware that it will continue to heat a little bit even though it turns off. It may overwarm the bottle, so always check the temperature!"
2,What a disappointment.,"I had registered on my Baby Registry for this warmer because I loved the idea of its multi-use features (warms regular and disposable bottles and babyfood). Honestly, I wish I had not received it. In the time that I have used it, I have had more frustration than successes using this item. There is no rhyme or reason about how much water to use to get the bottle or babyfood jar adequately heated. Sometimes, it is too warm; sometimes it is too hot. I do not know if the other warmers are worth the extra money but I know this one was not worth its price."
4,works it's purpose,"Like this item a lot, auto shut off, any size/brand of bottle can be heated on this item, even baby foods. The only thing that makes this rate a little less than perfection is because you have to wait 10mins before you can use it again. Sometimes i miss to calculate the milk i am heating for (still cold), 10mins seems like forever waiting especially when your baby is so cranky dying for her milk."
1,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE,"I bought this item especially because of ""The First Years"" brand and I was extremely disappointed with it. I use Dr. Brown's 4 oz. bottles and, for some reason, each time I used the Quick Serve Bottle Warmer formula leaked or evaporated into the warming chamber and before I knew it we had burnt formula all inside the unit. My bottles that had 2 ounces of formula quickly diminished to less than 1 1/2 ounces when the warming cycle was complete and then I was left to clean up all of the burnt formula inside the bottom of the unit. Not a fun thing to do in the middle of the night or even during the day! I read other reviews where people had the same problem. I do not recommend this product at all."
5,Great Warmer!,"I've been using this warmer several times a day for almost 2 months and am really happy with my purchase. It is compact and convenient, and warms bottles in about a minute. It can take any size bottle, including the Avent wide ones (what we use), and the little measuring cup allows you to accommodate the size bottle and amount of milk in it so the milk will always warm to the right temperature. I would definitely recommend this product."
2,Not convenient,"I bought this warmer thinking it's more convenient than warming milk with hot water, but actually it is not...the amount of water needed is little therefore it has to be very precise to get to the temperature you want! It takes longer to fill the correct amount of water than needed. Also you have to wait 10 minutes to try again, if a bottle is not warm enough, you have to use something else anyway! The instructions state that the unit needs 10 minutes to cool down if you need to use it again, but it may actually take longer than that...I would prefer to use hot water than using this warmer."
2,Poorly Constructed,"This product is poorly constructed, requires patience and you don't have that with a baby crying. It doesn't heat to a temperature the baby would like, so you end up having to cool the bottle afterwards. Also I have to manipulate the On switch for far too long but I actually get it to turn on. After awhile I just gave up and stopped using it."
2,Necessary Evil?,"Been using this for 5 weeks now to heat 2-3 oz in Dr Brown regular bottles. Feels cheap, seems to heat inconsistently and just an overall annoyance to use.Looking for something better! Help!"
1,piece of crap,"We had this bottle warmer for 2 months, it never worked well, and tonight our babysitter broke it in the course of normal use. waste of money."
2,Poor as expected for its price,"OK. It does its work OK. It heats the baby's bottles.But it also has some important problems, which are kind of expected for the price:1) once it completes a full heating cycle, it takes a long time cooling down, during which you cannot use it again cause it won't turn on.2) the water that you put in it, very very quickly makes the metal heater at the bottom to become badly rusty and hard to clean up."
1,0 stars!!!,"First off, mine was white and it looks like they changed the shape and color now, whether that matters, I don't really know, or care. This is the most awful product. We tried it 3 times, once actually following direction, then twice adding more water to see if it makes any difference. Nope. It doesn't work. The ONLY thing it does is get the actual bottle hot. Almost too hot to the touch, but if you test out the actual formula, it was literally ice-cold. Like straight from the fridge. Awful, awful product. I find these mixed reviews odd, because apparently for some, it actually works and for others, like me, it doesn't do ANYTHNG. I don't know about those positive reviews, but for me, it was just utterly dissapointing. Pity really, it would have been SO convenient to warm a bottle up as quickly as it says(1 minute, I believe). But we have to continue doing it the old-fashioned way."
1,Not consistent,"This item was not consistent in the amount of warming it would do. We have Playtex Drop-Ins and could never get the amount of water right to create the proper amount of steam to heat the formula properly. Either the formula was too hot, or too cold. Then, at one time it was too warm and the Playtex bottle insert got so hot it fell out of the bottom of the bottle (it must have shrunk). Luckily, the baby did not want this feeding; she must have either sensed it was not right, or the rim around the bottle/playtex inset was too hot and we didn't realize it.There is no way to control the amount of heat to produce the proper warming of the formula accurately."
2,When You've Got A Hungry Baby.....,"The last thing you need is to have to put everything down to check a bottle constantly. Every time myself or my wife tried to warm a bottle in this thing, it either came out too hot or too cold. Having to constantly check the bottle became too much of a hassle and we simply quit using this warmer. Despite following the instructions to a tee, the bottles NEVER came out perfect. We either had to re-heat the bottle or let it cool down before giving it too the baby.To make things short, I'll say this: Use the stove or microwave. Once you get your child into a reasonably predictable routine, you can warm bottles at a reasonable time and easily without having to waste time and money on the First Years Quick Serve Bottle Warmer."
2,Would not buy this warmer!,"We weren't planning on using a warmer at first but we thought it would be easier-it works, sometimes.... as someone else mentioned it goes by how much water you use, but sometimes you can put the amount of water it suggests, and it won't be warm at all, other times you can put in the same amount water you put in before, and it will be piping hot. ours is very inconsistant, but that may not be the case with all of them- i would choose something else next time.."
2,temperature never right,This bottle warmer is not that good. I would have to stand there and keep checking the temperature to make sure it didn't get too hot. you can imagine how thrilled I was trying to calm down a screaming hungry infant at three o'clock in the morning!! I do not reccommend this product
2,"Too hot, too cold... aggravating!","I received this bottle warmer as a gift from my baby registry and I'm sorry that I picked that bottle warmer because it doesn't do a good job at all! Bottles are either too hot or too cold, even with the same amount of water... It's really annoying when you want to feed your baby and have to cool the bottle because the warmer heats it too much and baby wants to eat!The plastic inside the bottle warmer begins to deform after only two weeks of use and turns brown from the heat. Very cheap material for a bottle warmer when heat is inevitable.I can't recommend this bottle warmer at all!"
4,It does the job,"This bottle warmer is ok, the only complaint I have is that over time, it takes more water to warm up the same amt of milk in the bottle due to residue build up on the bottom. The solution to that is to wash the inside of the bottle warmer once in a while..."
2,Unpredictable,"This warmer is unpredictable. The same amount of water may overheat the bottle at one time, get it to room temperature another, and bearly heat it another time. It is rather annoying. The only reason why it got two stars is the fact that if it is still cool when you heat it, it doesnt take very long to warm it up to room temp."
4,Love this warmer....,I have been using this warmer since I started using bottles at 3 weeks. I love this warmer except for the fact that it takes 3-4 minutes to warm the bottle. Not a good thing when she is screaming to be fed. I use the Avent bottles. Usually filled with 4oz. The instructions are easy to use and it has the measuring spoon attached so you know how much water to fill in the warmer. The only thing I noticed with this warmer is you have to be exact with the amount of water otherwise the bottle is either to warm (too much water added) or the bottle is cold (not enough water added). We purchased 2 more of these one for each grandma's. I am looking foward to seeing how this warmer works with baby food jars.
5,Very easy to use bottle warmer!,"I gave it a 5 star because i warms just like you would warm a bottle on the stove. It heats pretty fast, i just always take it early but i think it really depends on how cold the bottle is (i have to warm room temp bottles as well or my LO will not drink it!)& the amount of water you use. So follow the instructions!"
4,Excellent Study for the Jazz Student,"Note-for-note written out jazz arragements from the all time greatest players - perfect for anyone (like me) who wants to study and learn jazz. But I had only heard of a few of the songs - to me - it would have been much more enjoyable to study more ""main stream"" standards. That said, you take the selections for their study value: find the complex chords substitions (b9/#5s, 11s and 13s) in actual context - transpose - try your tri-tone substitions for each - etc... There are also many RH runs/fills over I-VI-II-V-I patterns - excellent practice.For me - it's not a great ""learn/play/sound like a pro"" book - but rather an excellent in-context study of chords and style. This is very advanced and somewhat difficult stuff that might be discouraging for beginning players. But go for it - dig in!"
4,A classic for any Everest fan,"One of the better stories of an expedition to Everest. The narrative is well written although the urgency of the situation doesn't really come through. Even though some members lose toes due to frostbite, Hornbein's writing makes the expedition seem like a day hike on a bike path. Nonetheless, a interesting story to read if you are a Everest fan."
4,everest the west ridge,"Book was OK, but the author has a strange way of writing. Not as good as the other books on everest."
3,"Great Heaphones, but ...","I wear headphones for very long periods of time, and I have to say that these are wonderfully comfortable, and are of superb quality, however, the sound bleeds out and can easily be heard by someone sitting across the room, even at the lower volume levels! I've never experienced this with any other headphones, so would not recommend these if you're going to wear them whilst sitting relatively near to someone else."
3,President's Carter shares his Idealistic Views,"This book is a summary by the former President on his experiences negotiating the Camp David Accords, his visits to the Middle East, and portraits of the Arab and Israeli leaders through his eyes. The former president actually maintains that peace in the Middle East must be based on Israeli recognition of the Palestinians' right to self-determination and Arab recognition of Israel's right to exist. If you wish to start to see how our Former President saw the Middle East, it is worth reading."
3,BLOOD OF ABRAHAM: JIMMY CARTER,"THIS IS AN EARLY BOOK WRITTEN BY EX-PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER. EVEN AT AN EARLY STAGE IN HIS POLITICAL CAREER, MR. CARTER WAS NOT ASHAMED TO PUBLISH HIS ANTI-JEWISH AND ANTI-ZIONIST SENTIMENTS! TO UNDERSTAND MR. CARTER's CURRENT ANTIPATHY FOR THE JEWISH PEOPLE, ONE NEEDS TO READ HIS EARLIER WRITTINGS ON THE SUBJECT. MR. CARTER HAS BECOME THE DARLING OF THE ""HATE ISRAEL"" MINDSET. CERTAINLY MR.

HIS POST-MORTEM OF JEWS IS EXCELLENT, BUT I WOULD RATHER BE PRAISED IN LIFE; THAN EULOGIZED!A SPECIAL READ FOR HISTORIANS, WHO WANT TO UNDERSTAND U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT POLICY TOWARDS THE MIDDLE EAST."
2,Too Small for normal use,"I loved the idea of these little mini cookies, but when I got them I found very quickly that whenever you try to cut out a shape, the dough gets stuck in the tiny parts of the cutter and ""clogs up"". It was a great idea, just didn't work for normal sugar cookies. I had to pitch them and go back to the larger cutters."
3,M is for My thoughts,"So here goes. While some would say you should read Sue Grafton's alphabet series in order. My thoughts are M is for Malice can stand on it's on. It's the typical rich heir who thinks he has been disowned, then finds out through some mix up that he hasn't been disowned, he just hopes to be welcomed back into the family. Not much chance of that happening though because you have to throw in the typical murder victim with the female private eye, her lawyer friend & police trying to solve the case. Throw in a little suspense, a few twist & turns read by a good reader and you get a fair book. At least these are my thoughts on M for Malice"
5,"Loved it too!! The whole series a ""must read""!","All Grafton's books are an entertaining, personal escape for me. Like her other ""fans"", I wait impatiently for the next book ""N..."". Enjoy her style of writing, her ideas, and the adorable character, ""Kinsey Millhone"". Even when I feel the plot predictable, it's always a ""fun read"". Thanks, Sue Grafton and please keep 'em comin'"
3,Not The Best Entry In The Series,"Sue Grafton's alphabet series featuring Kinsey Millhone can usually be relied upon to provide an entertaining read. However, some of the most recent installments in the series have proven to be somewhat weak efforts. M is for Malice is an example of these weaker efforts. The mystery just never hooks you and if you have never read Grafton before you will find little to catch your interest. Some of the earliest books in the series were among the best mysteries I have ever read. The last couple of books have fallen way short of that. Let's hope this trend ends soon or Z may be for Zero Interest."
4,"Good ""basic"" detective story","How much more ""back to basics"" can you get than this? A multi-millionaire dies. The current will is missing so an older one has to be used. The dis-inherited black sheep son is found and brought back to the mansion. Murder & mayhem follow.Kinsey's personal life continues to evolve in this one. Set in 1986, the total lack of laptop computers, internet & cell phones are a bit jarring and will probably confuse younger readers (why doesn't she just google this person?) who don't pick up on the clues, do the math and figure out what year it is.I am an occassional reader of the Kinsey Millhone series rather than a hardcore fan, but it seems to me that they have a tendency to get better, rather than weaker like most series."
2,Not her best.,"This one is a bit disappointing. As a general rule, it is an enjoyable read, but the best scenes may well be the interaction between Millhone and Dietz. What really does this one in is the handling of the ""ghost scenes"", if you can really call them that. They read more like a badly performed seance. It this is the best Grafton has to offer on the subject of ghosts, we are indeed fortunate she is leaving the subject entirely alone in the rest of her novels."
3,It took 12 Chapters to get to the murder.,"This is my first book by Sue Grafton. The main character, Kinsey Millhone, is a very likable person to whom I'd expect many people to be able to relate to. The story was smooth flowing and interesting. However, my main complaint is that it took no less than the first 12 chapters to explain the background of the story, during which certain facets of Millhone's social life were intermittently described. Although I did not find this boring, I think the whole point of reading a murder-mystery book is to enjoy the thrill of solving the 'whodunit'. The victim was murdered (finally!?) on page 165 out of a 300-page book (hardcover edition), and so the murder-mystery began in earnest when the book was already more than half complete. Overall, the book was quite enjoyable, but not exactly what I was looking for."
2,mostly agree with the 4s or so; just one additional ?,"Almost all first-person private eye novels are written in the past tense, which always creates a little bit of a problem--why is the PI thinking back over the entire case in such a chronological, narrative manner? Usually, however, we just suspend our disbelief and enjoy. Yet Grafton, at least in this book, has Millhone more or less address--and certainly demonstrate an awareness of--her audience. #$(*#)@@(#)? She may not realize it, but such a move endangers the entire private eye genre (one of my personal favorites, don't get me wrong) forever. N had better be for Normal."
3,Who Did Kill Guy Anyway? Kinsey Gets Tangled Up!,"This book was pretty good to read. I didn't find it that hard to get into as many people said on here-but the ending could have been better.Kinsey was assigned a job to try and find the missing member of the Malek family-Guy. He has a share coming from his father's will of 5-million dollars, but the family is holding a lot of hatred against Guy for their own reasons. Therefore, when Kinsey does find Guy almost right away in the story, there is another reason the Malek's wanted him back-for malice, and evenmore so for Murder. And this is what happens when Guy chooses to try and make amends. Kinsey sort of liked the man, and is feeling guilty for leading him back to his malicious siblings. One of them had the nerve to kill-but whom? Was it Donovan, Jack, or Bennett? Or maybe it was Kristie or Myrna? Kinsey is watching everything with a very close eye to see exactly who the guilty one is."
3,Entertaining Listen,"Duly chided for not reading anything else in this series, I compounded the chastisement (of another reviewer, see below) by not reading, but only listening to this one, on a Thanksgiving drive to Arkansas. I wasn't expecting all that much but I was pleasantly surprised; it kept me awake and interested, and the character of the female private investigator, as well as her love interests, was deftly handled. The murderer at the end seemed somewhat pulled out of a hat, but I guess that is an occupational hazard of formulaic fiction. It served its mysterious purpose."
3,Not her best work,"I love Sue Grafton books, so I was a little disappointed with this one. It's OK, but doesn't compare to her others!"
3,I think Sue Grafton is losing some steam with this series.,"As always, Kinsey Millhone is getting into her usual trouble and scuffles. However, at this point in the series, much of the storyline seems to be the same old stuff. I'm hoping that things pick up, because I have really looked forward to the publication of each book in this series."
3,Not as engrossing as the previous books.,"Having followed the alphabet adventures of Sue Grafton's female heroine, Kinsey Millhone, I think the author is losing steam. 'Malice' had a couple of good twists and turns in the storyline, and although I still find them enjoyable, her later books have failed to hold my attention the way her earlier books did. The author needs to pack a few punches if she is planning to continue with the other half of the alphabet."
4,"Better than some, not as good as others....","I have read all of the Grafton alphabet series through ""M is for Malice"", which I just finished recently. I find Kinsey to be a believable and compelling character, and I enjoy her ""loner on the fringes of polite society"" point of view about things.I was a little disappointed with ""M is for Malice"" -- I felt that after all of the background and sleuthing around, the ending felt a little rushed, a little thrown-together-at-the-last-minute. And call me a purist, but I prefer the endings where Kinsey is in mortal danger at the end, like when she has to fight her way out of a dark basement where the killer thinks s/he has trapped her....I'm also kind of disinterested in Kinsey's newfound family members. Kinsey herself is not that interested in them, so why should I be?"
3,M is for Meandering,"I thought that after diving head first into the mystery and thriller genre, that I should read some of the great alphabet series. Someone convince me that I should read more, because this book did not make a good case for the author.Is this what happens when lengthy contracts are written, or when we expect ""M"" to follow ""L""? It was painful to wait for the obvious to happen, and the payoff was not worth it."
3,Good PI Book,"""M"" can stand for many things, but in this rich family's life, it definitely stands for Malice! The family hired Kinsey Millhone to find the brother who had disappeared eighteen years ago. The father had died and the Will was no where to be found. Only an older Will was where the correct one should be. Guy was to be located so a way could be found for the black sheep to receive nothing from the existing Will...***I enjoyed this one. There is no heart pounding from Kinsey being in any real danger, but for mystery lovers this is one to test you.***"
3,"A Weak, Unfocused Effort","This series is running out of steam. I could not find myself either engaged or enraged by any of the characters, and the mystery itself strains credibility.Grafton is attempting to carry on a soap opera (Kinsey's relationships with her cousins and Dietz) within a ""politically correct"" mystery and just can't bring off either. Sara Paretsky covers the same ground much better, IMHO."
3,I have mixed feelings regarding this one!,"I am having mixed feelings toward ""M"". It was hard to put down but I think why I read the first 130 pages so quick was becuase I was waiting for something to happen. Ms.Grafton took her time getting to the murder and then kindof rushed the conclusion. Not to say that the beginning of the book was boring. It wasn't by any means, I just think in a murder mystery the murder should be the central focus of the book, and it was but not until the middle of the book. I liked the prescence of Dietz, and I also liked seeing Kinsey become close to Guy. The epilouge of the book was sad and bittersweet. There was also a shocking twist at the end. This book should be read by hardcore Grafton fans and not by someone just starting out with her."
1,Now I know that Grafton is a hack writer.,"I just finished ""M"" -- my first Grafton novel. Grafton is a total hack, right down to the previously-undisclosed ""surprise"" ending.Kinsey Milhone is frumpy and thoroughly unbelievable as a detective. There was no suspense. I only finished reading because I hoped (unrequitedly) that _something_ interesting would happen plot-wise.Grafton has to describe the curtains in every room any character enters... The characters themselves are lifeless and cookie-cutter... What can I say? There are many better mystery writers out there; her fans would do well to spread their wings! I won't be wasting anymore $$ on this pulp."
4,"""KINSEY, YES----DIETZ, NO","Give me Kinsey but without Dietz. I know the sex angle should not bother me if I read mysteries but it does. I really wish Grafton would not use it as much. But, who am I to say, I could not write anything. Just like to read. Kinsey was her usual wise acre self. She went though the Malek family pretty good. The killer was a surprise in the end. A good read if you like fast paced mysteries. Kinsey is a good PI. I wonder if Grafton sees herself in Kinsey's place?????"
3,A fun read but less satisfying than some of the others,"Compared to some of the others in this dependably engrossing series, 'M is for Malice' ranks a bit lower due to an unsatisfying ending. I found myself wondering about the characters' reactions when they learned what really happened, since the story ended somewhat abruptly. Also the interactions between Kinsey and her friends and other regular supporting characters could have been better developed. Despite these criticisms, 'M' was a fun read and it's a strong series."
1,Space Time And Gravitation,"The softcover book is a reproduction of a 1920s edition. The quality of the print is poor with many smudges that make some paragraphs barely eligible. Had I known this, I would have choosen a more expensive copy to purchase. But, with books this old and long out of print, there is no guarantee of the quality of the reproduction...you pays your money and you takes your chances."
1,second ime,"Bought this item as a replacement one which lasted 6 months. The one prior to that had given me over 2 years of reliable temperature indication. So I thought the prior one was a fluke. I was wrong!! It seems that the new one is the norm.This new one lasted 10 weeks. The temperature indicator indicates 32 degrees when immersed in water. When the probe is taken outside of the water the indication is correct. It appears that there is something wrong with the probe.Since it is over 30 days since I purchased it from Amazon, I cannot return it.Talking to Oregon Scientific would be a waste of time since I did not buy it from them. Will go back to the normal pool thermometer."
4,"Not perfect, but perfectly adequate","I used this for my koi pond. It worked perfectly for 2 years, until it fell and now the display doesn't work any more. So don't drop it. Also, someone recommended sealing the joint where the cable comes out of the end of the probe, because sometimes that leaks and then it doesn't work any more.This product was much better than the Oregon Scientific floating one, which lasted two weeks. It leaked and ruined the inside. I don't recommend that one at all."
3,great idea but needs improvement,"For hazal nuts, pecans,and brazil nuts it's great the shells really don't fly all over the place like with other nut crackers.. but forget almonds , their shape and size make it impossible to open. Most walnuts are also too large to fit into the small opening on top.. Another possible problem is that It's made of some plastic type material which may not hold up under pressure after much use..a better one would have been made of metal and have a larger opening on top.. perhaps and even larger opening would make it so you can open several nuts at one time and just dump them all into a plate and pick away the shells.."
1,Complete Ripoff,This product is a complete ripoff. Its a flimsy piece of plastic which can't crack nuts at all. Amazon should be ashamed for letting this outright piece of garbage onto its web site. Avoid at all costs.
1,JUNK!! (If using for fresh walnuts),This broke on my first walnut and it pinched my finger to boot!! I returned it for a refund.
2,"Promising product, but dismal in the long run","This product doesn't look like much, but it does successfully crack all kinds of nuts, even the tough brazil nuts. Unfortunately, the shell shards can get stuck in the handle. If you don't carefully clean them out before releasing the handle, the handle can break off. Wish the manufacture had warned me!"
3,The Best of Floyd Cramer,"I like this CD because I grew up hearing most of the music. My only concern was that the CD only had 8 tracks on it, when the listing said it had 12 tracks. I was lucky that my tune I wanted was one of the eight."
3,How much does this thing weigh?!,"I've had mine for 8 years, so it's durable enough. It heats up right away. The wide design saves lots of time compared to all those skinny models out there. I noticed that the weight isn't listed on here, and I'd like to know so I can find another 2"" or wider model that's lighter because this is hard to handle and hard on my wrists and feels heavy. If it was lighter and more ergonomic, it would make the experience more pleasant. It's so clunky, bulky and hard to handle."
5,HAI 2 - You can never go wrong!,"HAI products are some of the best heat styling tools available. I've been a user of HAI tools for almost 6 years, and I've never bought anything else. I have long, thick, wavy hair, and on the highest heat setting, it does the trick. With HAI, you can never go wrong."
5,Love this straightener!,"Works great, makes my hair shiny and doesn't cause breakage or damage. A low setting straightens my hair great and it doesn't curl back up later in the day"
1,Horrible Quality,"I bought an even nicer version than this one for $120 at a store. I bought the Copper-T and had 2 stop working on me in the span of 7 months. The first only lasted 2.5 months. The third one I got through the warranty was not put together correctly and ripped out my hair. The warranty only lasts a year and the product will surely break down before then. I was told I could not have a refund because ""the store I bought it from is the company that took my money."" I have never been so frustrated with a company."
2,Straight Shooter,"I love the album as I have been looking for it for a long time. It plays fine on one of my cd players, but skips or freezes up on the other. Both players are about the same age. Not a deal breaker, just wanted to mention it. I am thinking that there is so much data on the disk (double album) that one player struggled to read it.Overall, very happy doing business with you.Regards,james smith"
2,Not as good as others in genre,"After reading the initial reviews on the site, I was expecting much more from this film. It simply does not stack up to the emotional punch and narrative vision of films like ""Raise the Red Lantern"" ""Temptress Moon"" ""Farewell My Concubine"" or ""Shanghai Triad."" The atmosphere in the other films I have listed is so thick you can smell the opera paint and incence, but Rogue was less engrossing, less compelling, less moving. The ghost from the past was out of place in modern-day Hong Kong. The directing was also a little weak in comparison with the top rate work on the films listed above.Leslie Cheung is fine, as in his later works, above, but I was not overly impressed with the female lead. She certainly does not hold a candle to Gong Li, who is the goddess of current Chinese cinema!All in all, fine for a rental, but not a repeat viewer . . ."
2,Mostly Unsatisfied,My main complaint about books edited by denes agay is that they do not lay flat. I sure wish music publishers would publish music book s with comb binding or something similar so the books will open and stay open so you're not constantly fiddling with them and cussing when they close on you while you are playing the music. Is this too much to ask for? And why doesn't Amazon inform us of the type of binding in the details of the book?
5,LOVELY FRAGRANCE,"Already a fan of Red flower candles, I was eager to try their skin care line. It's as fine as the candles. Once again, Red flower adheres to the highest standards in formulating this rich delightfully scented Body Wash.For me, Indian Jasmine is an apropos cold weather fragrance. It's rather heady, a bit intense in a lovely way, and generates feelings of warmth. The Body Wash is redolent of honey, almond oil and neem extract. Pale honey in color, the wash softens and fragrances as it cleanses.I've found that a quarter size dollop is more than enough for bath or shower. Simply lather over your entire body with your hands......and enjoy.The companion Indian Jasmine Moisturizing Body Lotion is the ultimate for added softening after bath or shower."
2,Range is terrible,"I'm returning this product. Beware of the 90 ft range claim. I put the outdoor unit in a window between the glass and the screen and about 25 feet away from the indoor unit, one room away. There's one interior brick wall with an open door in between the two units. The indoor unit is unable to pick up the signal from the outdoor unit. This is simply a poorly perfroming product as I had another brand of indoor/outdoor thermometer set up identically and there was no such problem. I give it 2 stars only because I like the large digital readout."
3,Somewhat dissappointed,I purchased one of these along with an indoor control unit. It was easy to set up and worked wonderfully for a few months and then the outdoor unit stopped sending information to the indoor unit. I'm not one to return things and make a fuss so I purchased another outdoor sensor hoping it was just a fluke. It also worked wonderful for a few months and then stopped sending information. Both sensors tell the temperature but don't send that information to the base unit. Fresh batteries have no effect. I don't think I can recommend this wireless unit.
4,Oregon Scientific sensor guide,This unit works well. The 90 foot max range is for a direct line of sight. Walls and obstructions can reduce this distance significantly.Oregon Scientific makes a number of main units and remote sensors. They do not all work together. Check their web site for which remotes work with which main units before you buy: http://www2.oregonscientific.com/service/sensors/default.asp.
1,Disappointed!,"I have two units and two sensors. I thought they would all be compatible. I just received this sensor yesterday and find it works alone, but isn't compatible with my units. I wish I had checked this out more carefully before I purchased it."
2,"The REAL Review: ""Glimmer""","While this book was fast reading--finished in two days, actually--it was hardly worth my time. The idea is compelling and the descriptions have the potential to be fascinating. However, truth be told, I thought the book was horrible in every writing and literature sense. The language style was boring and tedious, as well as poorly configured. The author seemed to have a lack-luster methodology which clearly showed through in her work. It seems to cater to the drama queen. As a humble suggestion: find a different book."
3,the poison of a soul,"I think this is one for those tortured souls out there, much the same as mournful Plath poetry was about thirty years ago. In much the same way, Waters goes all out in describing each minute detail that leads up to her ultimate breakdown. I enjoyed it, as a reflection upon myself I am not always too eager to see, but it's helpful to have a mirror before us every once in a while."
4,Shows the troubles of this young woman excellently!,"This book definitly shows, in great detail, the story of this woman, and what has happened in her family to make her lock herself in her dorm room and slowly go crazy. It was written in a way to make you think it was the authors true life story."
5,Musician's Delight!,"This has got to be one of the best albums of the seventies and definitely of Bruford's carreer. As a multi-instrumentist, I am bemused by this record every time I hear it. Tracks like ""Beezlebub"" and ""Sample and Hold"" leave us in awe at the proficiency of the musicians present in this album. And if we ignore the horrendous vocals of Annette Peacock, the album is even better. This record contains one of the greatest ballads I ever heard (""Either End of August"") and it is in 5/4.All in all, this record is amazing. To drum one of these tracks will take at least a day of practice and to learn the bass (Jeff Berlin) will take a long time. If you are a musician, buy it! If you love music, buy it! It is wonderful."
3,"Good bruford matierial, BUT...","It's Bruford's usual high-caliber playing, but IMHO nothing quite as exceptional as when he has the grounding/structure of Yes, but still fascinating in its own right. HOWEVER, the solo vocals just bite hard. I'm sorry, but they just don't fit. You can tell at some places she's not too sure what note she's supposed to be singing, she's way too high in the mix, etc. She's got a nice voice, but it just doesn't fit in this context. Other complaints are just a lack of structure. Seems to meander/noodle endlessly. I suggest listening to a friend's copy/sampler at your local used shop before laying down the cash."
3,strong but heavy,The bag is loaded with all features but it is bit heavier which adds up to the laptop weight...
4,Classic Neil,Everyone who is a Neil Young fan should own this a must have for any rock collection.mellow and still timely after all these years
5,A Little Part Of This In Everyone,"The first time I listened to Harvest was on an 8-track player in a funky `ole green Gremlin while driving a lonely back road across the Santa Ynez Mountains. I felt every note, each torment and smile Neil Young offered. Thirty four years later the Harvest album is downloaded on the home computer, the IPOD and is regularly played on the car's CD. Sure enough the Gremlin died, but the era of Neil Young's Harvest has no time limit; evoking all the old pain and joy no matter the time, day or format. It is a classic that remains fresh."
5,His Greatest Album EVER!,I love this CD. Every song makes me smile. A Man Needs A Maid made me laugh and cry. The words are like poetry. The songs make you think. That's all I need to say.
4,Neil Young's best opus.,"""Harvest"" is for me a part of country-rock music history. It's a classic... ""Out of the W.E"", ""old man"", ""The needle and the damage done"" and ""A man needs a maid"" are my favorites but everything is good. A must have...If you like this album, You should also glance at Crosby-Stills-Nash. They are in the same style than Neil young..."
5,One song,"Although the entire album is good, the song ""Heart of Gold"" makes it worth the money. The rest of these songs could be garbage (which they're not), but to be able to listen to that one simple, perfect song is reason enough to buy this CD."
5,Excellent.,"All of his albums are brilliant. I listen to this guy more than anybody (in general)...He ain't got the greatest voice..and THAT IS COOL. Even when he is a total jerk, he's still a thousand times cooler than Bruce! ""Everybody knows this is Nowhere"" might be his best album and 'After the Goldrush' too...those two are close but THIS ALBUM HERE IS GREAT AS WELL...its got Linda Ronstadt singing on it and it is a classic moment for Classic Rock! THIS GUY INVENTED GRUNGE...NOT ME ! BUY THIS ...IT WILL CHANGE YOU FOREVER ...AND You may never spin that Limp Bisket cd again, I promise ! --Clark Hagins 8-19-2005."
1,RE-MASTER THIS CD!!!,The sound quality on this CD is poor by early 90's standards. How did 'Reactor' and 'Hawks and Doves' rate re-mastering priority over this? RE-MASTER THIS CD....PLEASE!
5,Folk Rock's Elder Statesman Lives On,"I have mentioned in a previous review of the work of Neil Young, ""Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere"", that pound for pound in those days he and Crazy Horse stood tall in the rock pantheon. Maybe not as tall as the Stones or The Doors but somewhere in the mix. Now, getting close to forty years later, Neil has morphed into folk rock's elder statesman and still puts out some creative work. That is not what interests me now though, at least not directly. What is interesting about this ""Harvest"" CD is how much of the best work here reflects where Neil Young was heading after that brilliant ""heavy rock/psychedelic rock"" flash of work with Crazy Horse (and his work before that with several other groups). Some of the songs like the classic ""Heart Of Gold"", ""Old Man"" and ""Words"" could have fit very nicely on, say, his fairly recent ""Prairie"" CD. And that, my friends, is indeed a compliment."
5,The Moon Album,"Harvest is The Best Album Ever and It has always been with me since the day I listened to It. Frankly, I would bring It to the Moon because there is everything inside. I can't explain it but the ones who are madly fans will understand. Thank you to Neil and thank you for reading my review."
4,Very good album back in the (was it the 70ties ?),Great album that made it possible even for us up here in northern Europe to know about Neil. It really was a number one for several years.
4,Five stars EXCEPT for his 'voice'!!,"This is one of Neil Young's best -- if NOT the best. If thelistener can 'get past' his whiny voice, it's a winner!!!"
4,"Neil goes No. 1, but not for long if he can help it.","This is a very good album, but the last thing Neil needed was a hit single with Heart of Gold and the instant success made Neil run the other way and he is about to make his best music of his career and fool everyone especially the critics."
3,neil's worst from the 1970s,"this is my least favorite neil album from the 1970s, on the beach, tonights the night, zuma, comes a time, are all better than harvest. harvest sounds too commercial but it does have its good selection of tunes like old man, heart of gold, but it's the one that spins the least on my fuzzy warble player."
3,Great Music but...,This CD will not work in a Mac Drive. It works in every other CD player. Both parties claim ignorance. Customer service at its best.
1,MONUMENTAL wrist slashing DOWNER!,"Anyone, ...anyone who can listen to more than about five consecutive tracks from this extremely depressing album without committing suicide has to be commended.It's strictly lock up all sharp instruments before even considering playing this monumental wrist-slashing downer.Apparently back in the 70's everybody had this handy little adjunct to topping oneself, ......makes me wonder how anyone was even left around to take part in the 80's!Whining voiced, embarrassingly hokey whingeing self-indulgence passing as serious social commentary, ......and all sounding like it was recorded(?) on a stolen $2 tape deck in some dingy drug den? Was it?Look, I'm all for music reflecting the life and times in which it was produced, ...but surely the 70's can't have been THAT bad?"
1,Among the worst albums ever,"This is among the worst albums ever. The acoustics are horrible. Some sound like they were recorded in a barn. The songs to die for, instead of listening to.After his 1st 3 albums, I was expecting A LOT more. Needle and the Damage done. PLEASE!! Alabama. UGH!!His whiny, crybaby style got very old .Mr Anti-Capitalism does not give anything away for FREE. YOU GOTTA PAY FOR THIS CRAP!"
1,Harvest Moon CD,"This CD does not play at all. It states ""Bad CD"" when put in our car CD player. The songs play for alittle while then quit. Can I get a refund? Or really I would just like to exchange this CD for one that works. How do I do this?Let me know."
5,Harvest.,"It's very easy to become addicted to Neil Young's work, he has one of the most beautifully expressive voices in all of rock music and his songwriting grew by leaps and bounds, especially in the 70's. While many cite ""Harvest"" as his best work, it's impossible to catergorize it that simply without hearing all of his output. Young has created a non-stop stream of classic LP's from 1969 to the present and his musical development is evident on each release. Tracks like ""Old Man"", ""Out On The Weekend"", ""Words"" and my personal fave ""The Needle and The Damage Done"" follow simple, similar patterns and give the album a consistent, cohesive feel that deepens with each listen. While commercially successful, this is not mere product and still stands up as a satisfying work of art more than 30 years after it came out. Defines ""Classic Rock""."
4,An early indie rocker,"I bought this only because I love Old Man and Heart of Gold so much, and its one of the few cd's under $... these days. Anyway, I was immediately drawn in by Young's intimate lyrics and flowing chord progressions. If you are into indie rock these days, then this cd is one for you."
4,why does everyone complain about commercial?,"I mean, ok so there was a single, you know it's not actually a crime I'm sure it has kept his kids in shoes. (if only Boney M hadn't done it!)Other than that - If you are wondering which NY album to get because you're not sure and you've heard strange things about NY albums over the years (whiney singing/guitar solos/other)- go for this one.Everybody, myself included, gets this one first & it's not at all suprising when you listen to it. ( it is up there with Imagine, Tapestry, Man who sold the world - Scary monsters, Rumours, Led Zeps I -IV, CSN, Deja Vu)It would be silly not to give it a go now!The best way to listen is in the dark."
3,Just what you expect.,I wish I could say I'm a Neil Young fan but I'm not. I just get these for the Neil Young die hards!
5,Another of the albums that I'd take to my desert island,"This is not your most classic neil young album, but it is definitely one of my most favorite albums of all time. Funky, countrified, bouncy, yet articulate. I didn't listen to country music at that time in my life, yet even then this album led me to believe I might like it if I did. It's got a folk rock heart, and a country body, enough edge to be memorable, but enough bounce to still make me remember what it felt like to be 21 and young in America (all those many years ago)."
5,NEIL YOUNG ONE OF THE GREATEST,"This album is awesome every song on it is good. I really like Old Man,Heart of Gold,Alabama,and Words they are beautifully made. The others songs are good too they are little bit slow but great I really think Neil Young is one of the best artists to ever come out. Buy Harvest, After the Gold Rush, and Everybody Knows this is Nowhere."
5,"""Old man look at my life...","...I'm a lot like you. I need someone to love me the whole day through.""Folk/Rock at it's best. Simple acoustic chords, haunting lyrics, and poignant stories. Arguably, this is Neil's masterpiece album. The Needle and the Damage Done, is a wonderful lament for friends lost to drugs. Old Man is an ode to the caretaker on a ranch that Neil bought some time ago. Heart of Gold is just that...Solid! As a lad I spun this LP every night when I hit the sack. I had a Hohner harmonica and played along. This disc belongs in the time capsule of my life. Enjoy it for years to come."
3,Harvest on DVD-Audio is partially okay,"The sound on the DVD-A for this disk for tracks 1,2,4 and 5 is absolutely phenomenal as we have come to expect from DVD-A. If you are using DVD-A without bass management the other tracks (3,6,7,8,9 and 10) are going to give you vocals, piano, orchestra etc from your sub-woofer. Sounds terrible, so you are forced to use the DTS track for these songs. I didn't buy into DVD-A to have to listen to an inferior DTS track. Why can't they allow everything from 50hz and above into the fronts, centre and rears and throw everything else into the subwoofer channel? Every other DVD-A disk I have does this. This disk never should have been released the way that it was. Also, Neil is in the surrounds in most cases and everything else in the the front. It's like having Neil behind me and the rest of the band playing in front. This sounds kind of backwards."
3,"Many stand out, but some fall down","3 1/2There is no doubt at least some of this album achieves its classic rock status easily, but only the handful of songs, most of those already hits, stand out as truly masterful against lesser composed fare."
3,Hate Neil Young? Then you'll dig this!,"Step right up, ladies and germs, don't be afraid. What we got for ya here is a Neil Young album that the whole darn family can enjoy. Ten dusty little ditties brought to you by a hippie so wholesome you may ever consider allowing him to marry your daughter. Trust us: this is harmless, catchy stuff -- it's like ""Everybody Knows This is Nowhere"" never happened, and ""Tonight's the Night"" never will...."
3,A Timless CLASSIC,Back in 1972 this was never off my turntable with the likes off Led Zep IV and Electric Warrior Trex.All great albums and all different. All tracks on Harvest are good but the combination of tracks make this the classic album it is. Today we have DVD A and this has been transferred to that format. I would like to see it transferred to SACD. The present CD lets it down with a bad digital transfer. All of the classics that have stood the test of time should be given transferred to SACD. I'm only talking Classic albums. Theres a lot of garbage out there that does not deserve the treatment.So for music this gets 95% and the present day CD gets 60% for recording.In fact I wouldnt reccomend buying this untill its either been remastered using HDCD or DSD on an SACD. If you have a DVD A player try the DVD A version but I'm hoping SACD will eventually become the true audiophile standard due to the fact it sounds better.
5,Deja Vu!,"It was great on vinyl and even better in digital, who needs a remix. I liked it the first time I heard it, and I miss my albums. But this version brings it all back."
5,Great book!,Other people have already written about this book. I simply want to add that this book is worth of reading.
4,Understanding Abuse,This book has excellent qualities and well-developed research is included within. This book is excellent for domestic violence counselors and those in the criminal justice field. It is an excellent asset for any library--and it has been quite an asset for my thesis!
4,NOT what i expected,"So i bought this spoiler to spice up my car a bit. . . . . in the picture it appears as a very boxy and unique looking wing which was the look i was going for. . . . how ever what i got was not what the item appeares as in the picture. however i may add that it may not look like the picture it is a perfect fit for the car, it looks as if it were supposed to be factory, so dispite not what i expected i am overall very happy with the apperance of the wing, i will post picts when im done painting, i went with a duplicolor ""maraige"" paint well see how it turns out. . . . ."
4,A New Year's Eve I'm Glad I Missed,"If you have ever thought you had been through the New Year's Eve from Hell, read this little gem and feel better. The four thoroughly dysfunctional characters, John, Grace, Mike, and Amanda, are disturbingly real. I am exceedingly glad I don't know them, especially Grace, but I certainly enjoyed reading about them. The characters' roles are quickly established, and then richly developed through intense dialogue that draws the reader into the gruesome scene as it unfolds. My buttons were pushed: I felt pity, annoyance, rage, hopelessness, and disgust with the outrageous, self-defeating, enabling, and downright insane behavior of the individuals in this book. The ending leaves the reader to speculate as to what will become of John and Grace, in particular. It reminds me of waking up from a nightmare that isn't quite over, and then lying in bed thinking up the most (or perhaps least) satisfying possible outcome."
1,NoBark,The collar didn't work and have sent it back. Maybe it was just a bad collar. It did not fit the dog either.
5,Works great!,"This collar does its job and costs a fair price. Beware the bright orange collar is very thick and very long. It was way to big for one of our dogs, but ok for the other after we made a few smaller holes. Overall it does the job!"
1,"does not work, never worked no refund offered","We purchased this collar and a 4-pack of batteries for it. The audible sound works to tell you ""that its working"" but only the sound works. No shock. After hearing the dog bark with and without the collar, decided to try a new battery. Again, audible sound works and red light lights up but no shock. Finally, after being fooled that its working, I decided to try it on myself and can not, no matter how loud I get, make it administer a shock. The little red light will blink on and the sound will sound, but no shock. Now Im out $60. Do yourself a favor and skip the rip off. Buy some other brand.I only gave it one star because I couldnt find a lower number."
2,Goes off at outside vibrations...,"This works. However, it also goes off when a lawn mower, a truck, or a motorcycle goes by the house. So if you live near a busy road or have alot of outside traffic, don't buy this. I felt terrible that my dog got zapped as my husband drove by on the lawn tractor.The holes on it are also WAYYY too big. I have a medium sized dog who is in a medium collar. I had to poke holes in this to get it to fit. I can't image what people with smaller dogs would do."
5,Have two SportDog bark control collars,And happy with them both. After a few uses my dogs learned not to bark when the collar is on (even if the power is off).
2,NOT for small dogs,"This sport collar states it is for small dogs, NOT true. I had to cut and add holes for it to fit--only to find out that by its design (a belt buckle design ) I can not put it on my small dog. To pull it tight enough for the prong to slip in the hole, it chokes my dog. I am worried it will damage his throat!! If it is loose enough that it won't choke him when I try to put it on, it is too loose to work. Now I am stuck with a collar that I can not use, or return as I added holes to it !!!"
1,Warning: This tea COULD make you very sick,"This Yin/Yang tea is designed to clear your body of toxins. You take Yang in the morning before 1PM and Yin after 1PM, one or more cups as long as they are balanced. Funny, but the ingredients are the same in both teas. You also get a very small amount of tea for the price. But don't worry, you won't drink it all. Designed to clear your body of toxins, this tea made me VERY sick ... excessive sweating and nausea, followed by severe vomiting and diarrhea. It's one thing to clear out your toxins, but this clears nutrients too.I may be more sensitive than others since I have a digestive inflammatory condition, but you've been warned.They claim weight loss and I believe that because if you can't keep food down you'll definitely lose weight.There are other teas, such as Traditions Of Tao Inner Cleanse that work well and do not cause illness. Use this tea only if you are desperate and like nausea and throwing up."
3,Split Personality,"Good and bad on this expensive import. Robbie needs to decide what he wants to be when he grows up: pop legend or the next Tom Jones. I hope he goes for the latter, since he is his most charming when playing the balladeer and showman, instead of making very irritating dance mixes (the last two tracks are unlistenable).Robbie's medley with Tom Jones is incredibly entertaining and shows that he'll be able to cash in in Vegas show business once his pop star days are over. The punk rock chorus of Back for Good is another highlight. Angels acoustic version is so much more emotional and memorable than the pop/rock ballad version--the orchestra heightens the sadness of the lyrics. Cheap Love Song is just a fun pop song."
5,Angels (remix),This is one of the best dance songs I have ever heard. It makes you feel great through the music and the words. I have been trying to get this CD for over a year and now it is discontinued. If anyone has this CD I would gladly purchase it if you send me an email to: brianj18@hotmail.com Thanks
5,Angels is Heavenly!,"I spent this past summer in England and Robbie Willams ""Angels"" was one of my favorite discoveries of the entire trip. Whether listening to it in a pub or listening to my friend Paul sing an acoustic version in the quad at Somerville College, Oxford, I fell in love with the song. It is so beautiful and touching. Robbie Williams is incredible!"
4,copperpot steals the show,"I got this CD to review for my radio station and thought that it was pretty tight. Chicago producer Chester Copperpot has the great ability to custom tailor beats to the vioces and styles of the emcees. The samples and loops are quite original and hard hitting. The instrumental tracks are sublime (especially the opener).There are various emcees on this record, my favorites being Earatik Statik, Profound, and Brain Trax (gotta love that cockney accent). However, the aggressive battle-rap style grows tired quickly. I'd imagine the reason for this is the fact that the up and coming/unheard of emcees need to put their talent on the table. It works to the detriment of the album as a qhole"
3,meh,couple good songs but I would not buy this album again kinda wish I only bought the good songs off this album
5,Nice,Good format for repetitive review. Small bites of information to meditate on. Easy to understand and follow.
5,Fine older Sinatra album,"Sinatra here is in his later years, 1981 I believe, and this is a great album where singer is looking back on love gone bad."
4,great but not the greatest,"A fine album. However, the two greatest of this type are In the Wee Small Hours and The September of my Years (my favorite). That is just my opinion."
2,Point Blank,Album has been over-hyped as Sinatra's last great album. Not even close. He is a ghost of albums past. Very very disappointing. He talks his way through half the songs.
5,Another of Frank's underrated Albums,"I love listening to this Album.Full of heart felt songs sung with the Sinatra passion. Almost a latter day ""Only the Lonely"" type effort. A must for all Sinatraphiles."
3,I expected different,"If you expect to hear the music that you used to hear from James Last, well don't, I guess the sound of the likes of ""Biscaya"" is what I wanted and is not, however still James Last and the songs are from ABBA, so it is OK'"
5,"A GREAT, CLASSIC ALBUM;No ifs, ands or buts about it!!","This album is a perfect and magical blend of rock, jazz, pop, folk, Eastern music and even sci-fi elements. Anyone who likes the music of Steely Dan or Traffic would take to this masterfulwork by a little-known, but obviously talented and very smart band.The melodies are superb, the arrangements exquisite, the lyrics devilishly clever and wide-angle view imaginative. The sound fidelity is also quite good (especially for the early 70s). Why this album didn't sell at least several million copies will always remain a mystery to me (must have been due to a lack of promotion?). I find this music timeless, absolutely ageless. As fresh today as it was 30 years ago. The folks who DO know about this album tend to be downright ferocious in both their love of it, and their support for it. Find out why. Check it out."
5,The Melodious Hump Hits The Bullseye,"Like a lot of college students in the 1970's, your favorite FM station was an oasis of calm, especially while studying for finals. During the fall of 1973, while cramming for exams. I was shaken by this eerie but jazzy sound coming from my radio. So awestruck was I, I had to put my books down and listen to this strange groove. It was Sopwith Camel's ""Fazon"" from the Miraculous Hump LP. After listening to the song in entirety, I had to buy the album. It was well worth it. Sopwith Camel's blend of jazz, laid back latin and asian influenced rhythms and sardonic lyrics were a pleasant change of pace. It's been one of my favorite albums. I am so glad that it's on CD (way overdue!). For a college kid looking for some ""laid back cool"", The Miraculous Hump LP hit the target....bullseye!!!!! Thanks for the ""cool"""
3,Safe As Milk,"I once had a very unpleasant dream that Richard Carpenter had become the lead singer with Steely Dan...and made them sound like a watered-down version of Supertramp! This album brings that highly undesirable scenario to life....and consequently what we have here are some pleasant jazzy arrangements and a strange absence of energy which makes Sopwith Camel sound like they were heavily sedated when this music was recorded! If they ever remake the movie ""One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest"" this would be the ideal straightjacket - I mean soundtrack -....""Nurse - please let me have my Captain Beefheart albums back.....!""Was this review helpful to you?"
2,Ehhh,"I looked around for a pedometer for awhile, and coudln't find a definitive review on any of them. This one is just okay. I guess it works okay, although it seems it might overestimate a little. The pulse thing is just okay. My battery falls out too easily. I got mine on sale, so I'm not too worried about it. It was interesting to see how much I walk on a typical day."
1,broke after 1 week,"This pedometer was fantastic for the one week that I owned and used it. My only complaint was that it was hard to get it open. Well, that problem was solved when the latch broke altogether! Now it's useless and will be thrown in the garbage. Don't waste your money."
3,"The best one I've tried, but not great","Most pedometers I've tried haven't worked at all. At least this one comes close. I walked a couple of measured paths and this one came close some of the time to the measured distance on its most sensitive setting. Like most pedometers I've tried, placement of the pedometer is critical. Sometimes, it's around 95% right and sometimes it's around 75% right. It seems as if companies could do better than this, but this is the best one of the four I've tried."
1,not accurate,I bought this pedometer and I usually read all reviews on amazon before I buy things. I don't know if nobody had reviewed it when I purchased it or what because I would not have bought it with all those bad reviews. Anyway...I have not had accurate readings with this pedometer. It might be because I run with it instead of walk but even when trying to test it around the house walking it does not seem acurate. I have also e-mailed the company several times from their web site with no response yet. I also agree with it being hard to open the cover. when you are running and want to look at your progress it is almost impossible to open the cover without messing up the reading (That is inaccurate anyway so what does it matter)
3,Very good but unduly complex,"Unnecessarily hard to setup, works well and is fairly accurate. The pulse feature is hard to get to read accurately. Instructions are good but too many modes and multi functions."
1,Bad speciications,"On the operation manual everything is metric, is false, on my pedometer every is Emperial.Pulse meter does not work."
2,Only lasted a month,"It was great at tracking my steps, it was great at taking my pulse very easily, and it stayed securely to my waist. However, after about a month, the battery cover came off unbeknownst to me. So the unit is useless now. The only other problem I had with it was that the cover was extremely stiff to open. If I wanted to check my steps, I would usually think twice because it was a major event to try and open it.Now I need a new one, and I'm not sure I'll buy another one of these...."
2,Cover broke after 3 months,"While I found the device fairly accurate - the hinged back broke over after about 3 months (just when the warranty runs out) it is plastic and on the flimsy side. I will check first, when I replace this.Without the proper mounts on the back, the device is essentially worthless."
1,Worse product I ever spent money on&#65533;..,"Cover broke after 3 months; the battery falls out too way to easy.It's a bad engineering design. Customer service has a backlog of cover replacements. It is plastic and its on the flimsy side, the device is essentially worthless and now my unit is sitting on my desk gathering dust now.I had called, wrote and emailed customer service numerous times for months with no response. I'm sure I'll buy never buy another one of these or any products made by/from Oregon Scientific the way they treat their customer base.Recommendations: Stay away from it, Buyer beware. Don't waste your money!"
1,Read the reviews before buying this product,"I received one of these as a gift, and immediately came across the problems highlighted in the product reviews above. I never knew about these reviews until I came across them while trying to find out how to return this gift (so at least some good came out of it) When you close the lid, it is almost impossible to open the lid without damaging the unit. The plastic shell is a very poor design, and I hold little hope of a replacemet unit solving the problem"
5,One of the earlier movies,Hey! it's John Wayne.....Just watched it again yesterdayand it's a great movie not shown on tv very often.Different from his usual fare but you'll like iteven if you aren't a big John Wayne fan.
3,A Wayne romantic film in style of John Wayne,"A common John Wayne film with typical John Wayne styles and macho manners. The German Captain is nobody but John Wayne. He talked like John Wayne, acted like John Wayne. Even romaticises like John Wayne. A simple John Wayne film except he was dressed in German Uniform."
2,Have you read the book?,"I'm writing purely as one who has read the book. I'm almost always disappointed in films based on books and this one was no exception. Whilst the basic plot line is there, there are too many new threads which simply make the story tacky. Typically, the pace of the film grossly exceeds that of the book. If you've read the book and think you might buy this as a pictorial version - forget it."
3,the sea chase,"I found this movie amusing. a very good movie for a boring sunday when you have nothing else to do. The accents were really bad. John Wayne as a german was very wierd. Sometimes its hard to be convinced that the people were in any kind of a hurry or pain, but other than that the acting was pretty good."
2,Strecthing the Boundaries of Credulity,"John Wayne is a great actor who works best in Cowboy and Gung Ho American soldier roles. He is a type casted actor and his role as a German tramp ship captain who hates Hitler is nothing short of funny. Not that the storyline is bad, it is just a situation of miscasting. Although Wayne's acting is good, his American accent and the thought subliminally that a cowboy is playing a German totally destroys the mood of the movie. But the movie is worth watching especially for Wayne fans."
5,Bear Hiding,"I have to buy this. My cable system had it on for a few weeks and I was able to play it for my 16 month old daughter every day. Then it suddenly disappeared from my viewing choices and she keeps saying ""bear hiding,"" ""bear hiding."" Even in the middle of the night I swear I hear her saying ""bear hiding."" What a cute little blue bear hiding behind the box! She just loves this. I have already bought First Words, and that is great too."
5,I like it enough to write a review...Need I say more?,"It's a great machine, and I'm glad I purchaced the IIIx. I've seen the V and the VII, and the IIIx is the best. I do wish I had waited a little longer for the color version, but that doesn't really matter for me, because I use the MIDI software more than anything else. The memo pad is cool too. I take notes in class and print them out with my desktop comp. I also have a color cover, and that makes it look brighter. The backlit screen is great!I also researched the Handspring Visor, but the color display was hard on the batteries, and the memory says it's ""upgradable,"" but I haven't seen any proof yet.So buy the IIIx if you don't care about color, and if you need the extra 2 megs."
4,Handle with Care!,"The Palm iii is a great product, and the Palm iiix is definately worth the extra money if you run Outlook on your PC - within days you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. But it is fragile - really fragile. I've dropped my mobile phone on countless occasions, likewise my calculator, and even my lap top once or twice. And they all lived to tell the tale. Drop your Palm once, and you can be looking at a cracked screen and - Wham! $100 replacement fee. What's more, you can be waiting 3-5 days for a replacement to arrive. So if you're anywhere near as clumsy as me - buy a case, and be very careful when you're taking it out"
3,"The PalmIIIx is great, but I have a few problems.","First, I have to agree with the electronics fan from Chicago. Although my Palm got the date right, some of the pixels on the screen would stay lit no matter what program was running. At first the ""Customer Care Center"" with Palm accused me of dropping it or something; ""physical damage"". They told me it would cost me $100 (US) to have it replaced (I assumed a new unit). This really irrtated me. When I bought it (Dec. '99)it worked fine, when I replaced the batteries once, I started to have problems like this. Eventually, after some serious, pissiness on the phone with representitive, they offered me a used unit. I sympathize with the electronics fan. After all, it doesn't even feel like mine, call me crazy, but I bought MINE not someone else's. So far the used Palm has worked fine, but I would really like them to fix their mistakes for us insted of shipping off the other misfit products to their customers."
5,For a first purchase...this is the one,This was the first PDA I had ever purchased and I was unsure if the product would meet my needs. After reading all the reviews I decided to purchase the Palm IIIx...and I have to say that the product more than lives up to the reviews. It is easy to use and has more than enough features for the standard user. I wonder why it took me so long to purchase one after using my Palm IIIx. I would recommend this product to anyone.
1,A bug in some units.,"As good as the Palm IIIx is to many, there's a bug in the unit for some. I returned my new Palm IIIx after three attempts at Hot-Sync'ing and losing all my data. Tech support tried but failed to identify the problem. They said a Palm engineer would call me, but that never happened. I'd like to buy a new unit thinking that my past problem was a fluke, but I see others here saying the same thing. Buy with caution."
4,Palm IIIx,Pretty easy to use and down load programs for someone that can spell kompooter 2 out of 3 times.
2,very useful but mine malfunctioned within 2 months,"Although I love it and found it to be more useful than I had expected when it would not turn on or activiate after two months of use I felt lost, ripped off and up a creek with out a paddle. Would 3com upgrade to the latest model - NO WAY ! Did it take 10 minutes to speak to someone in customer service - count on it. It may be too early for this technology to last and $300 plus for a 2 month day planner will hurt you just like it did me ! You have been warned !"
4,Get yourself Organized !,"Palm IIIx is cool but for the price I paid, I expected a much better finish. Not very happy with the battery life too. Otherwise it's really a great product!"
3,Mislead,"I purchased the Palm IIIX because I thought that it had an open expansion slot for addition of memory upgrade cards. I wasn't able to locate the expansion slot for additional memory, so, I contacted Palm. The customer representative stated that it is only upgradeable as far as the operating system is concerned. You aren't able to use an additional memory card for this handheld.I have been able to download some applications to the handheld, but, I would have preferred more memory."
3,Defective Unit?,"I just bought a Palm IIIx and although the functionality of the machine is great, I've had glitches with my unit. I had problems performing the hot-sync - maybe a problem with the unit or cradle and the batteries would go dead after 2-3 days (this happened three times). I also lost all my data (twice) without any low battery warning. I'm getting a replacement and I hope that this was a anomaly."
3,First Time Buyer - Palm IIIx,"I finally purchased a Palm, and haven't looked back. Never late for an appointment and I always have peoples address and phone number on hand. Well worth the $230.Would have been 5 stars, but I was disappointed with lack of Netscape Communicator support. Technical Service was of little help, replying with ""canned"" instructions on how to set up mail (using MS Outlook Express). I changed over to MS for my mail (so much for the federal lawsuit) and I could then sych my mail (after upgrading to version 5 MS-OE)."
3,Good but BEWARE the streaks,"I have to say that I've grown very dependent on my IIIx. I'd give it a score of 5 except for the streaking problem. Mine didn't do this right away. It started hapening about 6 months after I began to use it. Sometimes its there sometimes it isn't. When its there, the streaking (looks like water was spilled on a sheet of ink writing) can make the screen totally unreadable. Five minutes later, all can be fine. PDA need to be dependable. Mine isn't always. Before I started reading other reviews, I thought mine was just broken. I was considering buying another but not if by luck, I get another ""streaker"". Even though I like the IIIx, its reasonably priced (though still expensive), has great software options, I'd be cautious about buying another one. Probably wouldn't go with the IIIx if I had known about the streaking problem in advance."
5,Do you buy the Palm IIIx or Palm V?,"Just wanted to say to anyone who, like me, was not sure whether to buy the new, funkier Palm V or the Palm IIIx.. Just read all of the reviews listed here and your mind will be made up. Palm IIIx is upgradeable, more powerful and less money...ummm...tough choice."
4,Takes a long time for the clock to be set...,"This is a cool clock, however, it takes several days after you turn it on for the clock to be programmed by the national atomic clock in Colorado. This was a let down for me, now with a little warning....you will be prepared for this. I am sure that any 10-35 year old boy would love this gift for Christmas, I would suggest however that you start it up before wrapping it up, this will give the clock time to be set. It comes with batteries so all you have to do is pull a little plastic tab in the battery compartment and the clock will start."
5,The most unique book on Corporate Strategy you'll ever read!,"Conor Cuneen has taken strategic business concepts and incorporated them into an invaluable book that's hard to put down. His character, Finbarr Kozlowski, uses well-known businesses like McDonald's and Harley Davidson to illustrate to the reader the pitfalls and turnarounds of some of the world's most successful companies. Of course, the value of Conor's book is found as Finbarr transfers the lessons of these giants into applicable action plans to use in our own smaller companies. WHY IRELAND NEVER INVADED AMERICA will provide you with ideas to improve and/or identify a successful vision and strategy for your business.Dino R. RomanoPresidentwww.GreaterCashFlow.com"
5,Read Conor Cunneen's Why Never Invaded America,"Conor Cunneen's Why Ireland Never Invaded America was an enjoyable, informative read for me. I am in sales and His book has motivated me to become more positive and receptive to change. It has also helped me evaluate what type of values a company must have should I decide to join it. Get this book you won't be disappointed it will help you with those difficult decisions we all face when doing business. Evaluating our competition, the company (boss) we work for, looking for a potential employer, etc. I have also had the privelege to hear this man speak. His words of wisdom will give you that edge over the other guy."
2,piano music,I dont know where they dug up these interpretations by Floyd Cramer. He was one of my favorite artist but this one sure doesnt sound like the Floyd Cramer I loved.
5,Amazing,"I saw Decoded Feedback live when haujobb cancelled, and was completely blown away by them. They had a very simple stage setup, but the atmosphere and music were so beautiful. It was one of the best shows I've ever seen. I ordered this album, and it didn't disappoint. My favorite tracks are Bio-Vital, Machine Kontrol, Again, and of course Breathe. A very beautiful work, remnicent of both EBM and goth music."
4,Amazing spine chilling music,"This is by far the darkest album from Decoded Feedback. These songs seem to be geared towards religion and politics with deep dark haunting synths and unimagineable distorted vocals. The best track on this album is by far ""God's Sin"" it is creepy. Breathe is amazing too along with Relic. Seriously buy this if you have a good taste in music."
4,Likable despite lack of ballads,"Only three of the songs on Clint Black's album One Emotion are slow songs--""Untanglin' My Mind"", ""A Change In The Air"", and the closing song, ""You Make Me Feel"". This is not how Clint started out. The majority of his early hits--""Killin' Time"" and ""A Better Man""--were well-crafted slow songs. On One Emotion, outside of the three songs I previously mentioned, every song is upbeat. The best of the remaining songs are ""Summer's Comin'"", ""Wherever You Go"", ""Life Gets Away"" and the title track, ""One Emotion"". ""I Can Get By"" has a similar arrangement to Clint's hit ""We Tell Ourselves"", but I think the latter song is better. Furthermore, I think ""Hey Hot Rod"" and ""You Walked By"", although good musically, could have been better written. Nevertheless, although Clint went kind of commercial on this one, I give him credit for doing different things than he had already done in his songs. I also give him four stars."
3,Good but not the best,"Clint has a great distinctive voice. While this album contains wonderful songs like 'You Made Me Feel' (this album's masterpiece, very jazzy), 'Untanglin' My Mind', 'A Change In The Air' (beautiful ballads), 'Wherever You Go' (groovy) and 'You Walked By' (great swinger), it also has its dull or let's say, ordinary moments with oh-so-radio-friendly tunes like 'Summer's Comin', 'Life Gets Away' and 'Hey Hot Rod'. Clint is a classy singer and he succeeds in lifting these songs to the no-more-than-average level but I think he deserves songs better suited to his talent."
2,Gee thanks a lot Clint.,"Right here is where the full betrayel goes down. There were hints on the last cd, but I thought it was just an off effort. But no, here he gives us a whole album of pop filler songs. I don't think I kept this cd for 2 months before I traded it in. I hope one day he straightens out and returns to his country sound. Stay away from this cd. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because of the fantastic cover and all around packaging."
4,It was Great,"This book would have been great, i'm sure, if i had read it. I've been stuck on every book i've read the gerald lund has written (except for one, but that's because it was about something i'm not all that interested in). Anyways, whoever is reading this should read is bestselling searies, the work and the glory. they're really good. that's all i have to say about that."
3,Romantic but just not a solid page turner!,Sorry but Tom and Lauren just did not do it for me. They both did not appear to be a couple that had pined away for ten years. Lauren sees Tom who she supposedly has loved forever and almost immediately announces she plans to go back to Texas. Like Texas was what she had been missing not Tom? Come on that is just not right. Aand Tom had been loving her forever and talks about opening her dress to see her bosom and then says he will help her get back to Texas. I understand at first they were guarding their feelings because of the non received letters but after that was cleared up they should have been in each others arms and in bed! And the first time ended up being because of a fight with Tom and another peer? There were just too many things that did not ring true and upset the real romantic feeling you were supposed to be getting over a couple that had loved each other deeply for ten years!
2,Fine story but....,"I was not taken in by the characters. Stronger tension and dramatic romance would better be served by reordering the way this book is presented. A good example of the whole ""love revisted"" theme was a book by Lisa Kleypas called ""Again the Magic."" That book had me in tears. Or maybe, she was trying to do the whole ""Notebook"" thing which still didn't work for me. Instead, I am a bit sleepy after reading this one. The story is predictable, the antagonistic characters are like cookie cutter versions of the same characters in every romance.By the time you get into the romance, you think the heroine is still pining these last 10 years over a boy who just wanted to get a peek at her bosoms. We aren't treated to the rest of the flashbacks until much later and then it is too late...for their reunion meeting is over, and I just didn't care."
5,Promise Me Forever,I loved the book and would recommend anyone that like romance to read this book. This book is easy and light reading.
3,Where was the tension in this romance?,"I usually enjoy Ms. Heath's work, however there are two books, including this one, where I just couldn't come to like the heroine. Lady Camilla in ""As An Earl Desires"" and Lauren Fairchild in this work. Although the plots were good, there was no drama or romantic tension between the hero and the heroine. I felt the same I the first book mentioned. I just wanted it to end."
4,Most of All!,"I want me a Bradley to love me most of all! Elandra and Bradley's story about two ""once burned"" trying to get it right the second time around. Real enjoyable book that I recommend you go out and get!"
4,Certainly is a great story .....,"however I couldn't give it the full five stars since I felt it was somewhat lacking on the eroticism scale since I think the author tried to hard to push the envelope ...The story evolves with a stock beautifull virgin, Clarissa, who has been betrothed to the dark and sinister (whatelse) Lord Maldon. Clarissa's recently married father takes off on his honeymoon with his young new wife, Alice, leaving poor, and let me tell you, frustrated but smouldering virgin, Clarissa behind, waiting to meet her, arranged marriage, husband ....The worldly Lord Maldon, who, by the way, owns several houses of ill-repute arrives in London early to do a tatse test of his upcoming nuptials .... the fact that Clarissa has fallen in love with a young Italian artist forces Maldon to kidnapp our happless virgin and put her through the paces ....Those readers that enjoy 'willing rapist' and some mild B&D; will certainly rate the book at the 5 star maximum...."
4,Lone Rhino/Twang Bar King,"Both albums are great examples of Belew's early 80's. Anyone who owned the original LPs may want to reconsider purchasing the CD collection though. The Lone Rhino transfer sounds fine but the Twang Bar King transfer sounds really bad. Extremely noisy, harsh and at times uncompressed to the point of being obnoxious. Don't know what happened but they dropped the ball on reissuing two really good records here."
3,Lone Rhino,"I honestly think this album deserves two reviews:One for musicianshipOne for songwritingI give it 4 out of 5 stars for musicianship. The guitar playing is inventive, innovative (Lone Rhinoceros, Naive Guitar) and the bass playing by J. Clifton Mayhugh is superb (check out Addidas in Heat, Swingline and Stop it.)I give it 3 out of 5 stars for songwriting. The stand out cuts for songwriting: Adidas in Heat, Naive Guitar, Lone Rhinoceros. Since so few cuts were that good thus the three out five.Influences are apparent: David Byrne, Frank Zappa, Robert Fripp however Adrian has managed to take his influences and forge his own sound. Always distinctive, always original, funny, quirky and extremely musical."
5,No Competition,What an awesome recording !! Johnny Smith set the standard for pick style guitar in the 50's and 60's. I just hope that someday the other 2 verve recordings come out on disc .
2,"Not Bad, but lacking in Key Areas","I have worked on numerous political campaigns at the local, state and federal levels, and overall thought this book was pretty good for what it covered. However, it is kind of lite on details especially in Campaign Planning, Precinct Analysis, and fundraising. This is a good book for beginners but you are definately going to need something else in order to run a successful campaign."
2,Stop reading a DO!,I purchase three of these books as I am a precinct manand I thouogh I would learn something. I did. Read one ofthese books and you will read the all. None offer anythingdifferent than the tried and true method of doing. Stop readingand DO.
3,Imaginative and Creative,"Let me start by saying Bill Lee is a wildly funny and inventive guy! If you have yet to read this book or his autobiography Spaceman do so soon!Bill Lee has a way of bringing his rich sense of humor out with every word and anecdote.This particular book is very creative. Bill Lee, like many other members of Red Sox nation has misgivings about many events in Red Sox history. So he takes this lovable but snakebit franchise to task... and rewrites it all!This revision of history is interesting and laughable. He begins by reversing the curse of the Bambino in 1919... and it just gets wilder and wilder from there.I guess my only problem with the book is dealing with all the changed history... the premise is funny and engaging at first but begins to wear as the book goes along.But by all means it is worth your time and effort. If you love the Sox or just love baseball read this book and you will not be disappointed!"
5,Makes Harry Potter look like non-fiction!,"The Little Red (Sox) Book is so fantastic, it makes the latest Harry Potter book read like non-fiction. Babe Ruth says ""Up yours, New York, New York,"" Ted Williams slays Hitler with a line drive, Bucky ""fugueing"" Dent becomes a pianist instead of a ballplayer, and Jackie Robinson comes to Boston because the Red Sox have become so racially sensitive. Oh, yeah, and the Yankees suffer the ""curse of the Bambino"" and become the Red Sox farm team! Meanwhile the ""curs"" of the Bambino, the ""nurse"" of the Bambino and finally the ""hearse"" of the Bambino, all stay in Boston. Makes a Muggle like myself proud to be a Red Sox fan."
2,A nice idea for an essay but not a book,"An excellent, humorous, inventive idea for an essay. But not nearly enough material here for a book. It contains a ton of filler and is haphazardly arranged (except for the core of the book). Not enough bang for your buck- at close to $20 hardcover, you could fly through the best chapters of the book (revisionist Sox history circa Babe Ruth/WW II/Jackie Robinson) in well under an hour. Large print and very small pages. The paperback version is a much better return on investment, but is still overpriced. I bought the hardcover before paperback was available, so it stung a bit more. And I remain a big fan of the Spaceman."
2,Silly stuff,"A very silly ghostwritten re-telling of Red Sox history spiced by a few Bill Lee one-liners that were tired and old a generation ago and are more tired and older now. Bill has morphed from being cool and hip into cranky and square. I want the Sox to win as much as anyone but even I have to draw the line at a fairy tale like this, which unfortunately perpetuates more than a few popularly believed but factually incorrect errors of Red Sox history. This is a relatively rich season for Red Sox books; buy a real one instead."
4,A very thorough collection,"In contrast with the principal competing collection of Swift's work (i.e., the Oxford Classics collection), the Norton Critical Edition contains all of ""Gulliver's Travels,"" ""A Tale of a Tub"" (my favorite of Swift's works), and ""The Battle of the Books,"" along with a solid selection of other writings in prose and poetry. Given the breadth of the selection, it is not surprising that this edition does not have an extensive critical apparatus. But it does have enough background material and footnotes to make the texts generally useful to the modern reader, and other materials are readily available. This may be more of a ""reader's edition"" than a truly ""critical edition,"" but it is still a valuable edition."
2,You might want to choose a different anthology.,"This anthology will serve those who don't care about the information that footnotes would provide, and those who already have that information in thier heads.For students who want to give Swift a serious and informed reading, this edition is not ideal. Footnotes are few, and there's little editorial help in navigating the complex historical, political, and religious issues relevant to the text. Without an understanding of those issues the many of the works included are largely unintelligable and therefore a lot less interesting. For the price of a Norton, one expects a bit more padding to come with the text."
5,For Use in Dishwashers,"I have been using Somat Rinse Aid in my dishwasher for a number of years. It doesn't take much. I just topoff reservoir every so often. This product will ensure your dishes come out of the wash cycle squeeky clean, fresh smelling, and spotless, and the inside of the dishwasher is clean. I am not sure how it works other than it is applied during the rinse cycle. I am happy with this product."
2,Great price...Accuracy? Not so much.,"The price of this product is what sold me comparing to other pedometers. I bought it being aware of the problems other reviewers have stated. The ""happiness"" ratio seems about 40% at best. The thumb clip has been problematic but you can work around it. But is that what you want in a product? The biggest flaw I have found is in its accuracy. After several tests of 50 steps the unit averaged being ""off"" by being over 40 steps...on the lowest sensitivity. Disappointing. I wouldn't mind it being off by being under because I would exercising more and thats good. But this way I feel like its cheating me at the cost of my health. I will continue to use this unit but I will be on the lookout for a new unit. I can not make a recomendation for this product."
4,"Sore thumb, yes, but otherwise ginchy","I've had mine for two days and agree with the others about the painful thumb button on the locking mechanism. I just shaved the little plastic catch down a little with an Xacto knife: problem solved.The step counts seem accurate to me and I haven't noticed any spurious ones while the unit was sitting on a table or anything. I believe there are defective ones out there, but mine seems fine.I'd recommend it, and I'd recommend shaving or sanding that little plastic ridge down to save the tip of your thumb!"
1,Save your money.,"It sounded like a good idea... Perhaps a higher-end model would work better - but this one felt awkward and performed ""cheaply"". The poor design made it difficult to open and adjust. I put it on once to test it and it seemed to be somewhat accurate in step counting with only small error. Before I got a chance to read the directions to try other options (something I have never had to do with what I would have thought to be much more compicated equipment) it got some moisture in it and stopped working completely. Into the junk drawer with other quickly dimmed bright ideas. A nice idea, poor execution."
2,Lacks accuracy and short on features,"Unlike another reviewer whose review I read, I found this pedometer to be inaccurate. It indicates many more steps than I actually take and is off by over a tenth of a mile in distance walked. I was especially disappointed when I learned that a friend and his fiance had purchased a different pedometer (for the same price as I paid for this one) that records their steps and distance travelled extremely accurately, even though they are completely different in height/weight characteristics. Moreover, theirs has a ""talking"" feature which tells them how many steps they have taken, etc. And, it looks nicer, with a black and silver case."
1,I should have listened!,Others have indicated that their pedometer would 'count' on its own when sitting on a table...well mine did too!! I packed it back up as soon as I opened it and mailed it back today for a refund!! Also counts steps when you open and close the cover. Try another product.
1,DO NOT BUY,"I decided to purchase this item even though several reviews spoke of difficulty with this pedometer. The extremes of the reviews, from 5 stars to 1 had me wondering if a few people just got a ""lemon"" OK - please listen to ME! It IS a waste of money. It IS difficult to open. It DOES NOT calculate correctly. I walk 10 steps and the readout varies from 14 to 256! I did reset, I did put the sensitivity button all the way to the left. It just is not a good item. Save time and choose another model/maker. I am returning mine."
1,Quit working right away,This product was never reliable. The battery did not fit properly and would lose contact.
2,Too sensitive,The unit I received didn't keep accurate time and was too sensitive even with the slider all the way to least sensitive. Pros = unit was light and easy to read with a good backlight.Cons = Info I was reading wsa wrong!
1,It worked perfectely--for 2 weeks. :-(,"Having a pedometer is fantastic, and definitely inspired me to make sure I was more active. However, this product is not up to snuff. The first one I ordered was next to impossible to open, and returned to Amazon within a day. The replacement I received worked fine, and then stopped working completely after 2 weeks. I have decided to research pedometers and find a good working model that will work consistently for a reasonable amount of time."
4,Easy to use - even for kids,"At this price, we got pedometers for the whole family. My 9 year old son has worn his every day since. It is interesting to see how many steps you take in a day. We did not set the pace length as recommended, but other than that, it is ready to use immediately - just clip it onto your waistband. Shows steps, miles and calories burned. My only complaint is that the front cover is a little hard to flip open."
3,Good & Bad,"The Good: The pedometer has a clock so there's no need to wear a watch, it shows distance walked in miles and steps taken in addition to calories burned. It has a back light, should you be in the dark.The Bad: It's not the most accurate pedometer ever. You set your stride length in inches and you can slide a sensitivity bar to suit your needs, but it still tells me I'm walking 12 or 14 steps when I'm walking ten. I went on a walk today and it told me that I had taken 3657 steps in thirty minutes. I find that hard to believe, so I either need to change my stride length or this thing is defective/of poor quality.I guess you shouldn't expect much for the low price!"
3,Accurately Measures Distance. Overly Generous With Calories,"I've used my pedometer for a couple of days now and overall I'm satisfied. It seems to accurately measure distance, but it is overly generous measuring calories. After walking 5 miles, it told me I had burned nearly 1000 calories!I only wish that were true. The calorie counting should be more realistic."
2,Not Durable,"The first one lasted a day, one day and when it fell out of my hand while I was passing it to someone to wear, it D-I-E-D.The second one (totally great return policy Amazon!) was taken care of as if it were fragile crystal. It lasted 6 weeks before it also found it timely demise upon hitting the floor.I think the concept is remarkable, the tool itself is fabulous, it really does count steps with great accuracy, but it is not durable at all. I am sadly disappointed."
1,Not what I expected,"I found this pedometer was not everything I expected. The pedometer does not fit on pants well, and mine actually broke when it fell off my pants onto carpet. I will try replacing the batteries, but as of now, I am not pleased."
4,Worked as advertised,This pedometer has many built in features that I can't honestly repeat in this review because I no longer own it.
2,Size was right........,"This little thing was perfect in size, but not sound. Every step I took, it made some type of clicking noise. I stopped wearing it shortly afterward because the noise was making me crazy!"
1,PE316CA Pedometer with Calorie Counter,"This was a very inferior product. I teach Pilates to young women between 35-40 years of age. They are very health-conscious and would use a quality product on a daily basis. This product was not sturdy, kept falling off with minimum exertion, and it was very difficult to follow the directions. I would not recommend this to anyone!"
1,My aching thumb!!!,"I'm not sure just how accurate this pedometer is. I've been SITTING in front of my computer since I put it on and it reads 141 steps so far and I have it on the lowest sensitivity level.More importantly, the tip of my right thumb is killing me from wrestling with the lid to get it open. The release button doesn't push in and release anything. You auctually have to use your thumb to pry it open.I will try using it tomorrow without closing the lid, but this seems to be a bit ridiculous.Oh, It now reads 148 steps..."
2,"O.k., but I can't get the door open!","Pros: it's really cheap, and has a lot of features (set stride length, calories, clock, backlight, protective door)Con: the door is really, incredibly, intolerably hard to open. I was adding a dozen steps to the readout just trying to get the door open. I tried to trim the plastic tab, but I took too much off, now the door flops open. It was useless the way it came from the factory, now I broke it and can't use it at all without a rubber band to keep it closed.Also, I was never able to get a very accurate step-count. I would count 100 steps and usually get 65-90 steps on the readout, though I'm not really sure because I had to shake the thing for a minute or two just to get the door open.For the price, I think this would be a great deal for someone with the patience to work with it."
2,Very Disappointing Product...,"I ordered this product because of the great reviews that I read about it online. Once it was delivered, however, I was extremely disappointed with the purchase. First of all, I find it very hard to open. It requires a lot of force and is even more awkward to open when it is placed on a waistband (versus just holding it in your hands). I was also surprised that, not only is there no way to turn it off- it is constantly on and wasting batteries, but after leaving it on my dresser overnight I woke up to find out that it had walked 27 steps on its own while I was sleeping! Pretty amazing, huh? I am very disappointed in this product and surprised by all of the other reviews. Hopefully this one is just defective!"
3,Nice - but don't drop it,"I finally got around to spending the time to figure out how to program this item, and then I dropped it on a cement surface. It hasn't worked since, so I threw it out. If you're careful, this would probably be a great item."
2,500 Songwriting Ideas: For Brave and Passionate People,"This book stimulates the mind to a certain degree, however each listed idea seemed rather brief. I felt it was more like a basic brainstorming tool for people who completely lacked creativity. I have also read The Songwriter's Idea Book by Sheila Davis and found that to be a fully comprehensive book providing ideas for songwriting, and it goes into more depth, providing examples where necessary... whereas this book failed to expand on the ideas listed."
1,this book is a total donkey.,This book has very little to do with SONG writing: it contians tips on LYRIC writing... and the author's lyrics are some of the worst I've heard in a while. I feel bad being so negative but I want to save people from wasting money.
4,Irish Magic,"This is an over-all good story. A few typo/grammar errors were distracting, and the ending seemed a bit abrupt. Was the author bored with the story and decided to just go ahead and end it? The assumed ploy by James to get Beatrice's money could have made a stronger conflict between the two. With its few flaws, I can't give this book fewer than 4 stars; it kept my attention and was an amusing read."
2,Ecstasy of Rita Joe Rough Structurally,"This play, though filled with poignant messages about the state of Native Canadian societies, is very rough structurally. There are great uses of light, and the setting Ryga proposes is excellent, but the play itself is so rough and deliberate that it is a less-than-pleasant read. It was written in 1967, so though perhaps groundbreaking in its time, this play is not really one to read for enjoyment alone."
3,Not Vogt's best.,"Funker Vogt are rather good at having their own style in the admittedly cliched field of electro-industrial music. This is probably their most generic effort, however. Disc 1 - with the exception of two rather repetitive remixes of ""Killing Fields"" - is largely a winner, and features the astounding song ""Vision"". It's all downhill from there though. Disc 2 is all remixes, and generally not very good ones. Most of the remixes either hack the songs down to industrial-dance filler, or are so close to the original song (e.g. the Killing Fields remixes, Wartime) that the remix seems unnecessary. My advice: Skip this and get We Came To Kill instead."
4,"only 2 reasons to buy, but 2 good reasons",First things first. Almost all of the other songs arent very good. But evil's birth and vision are so good that it is worth buying the album for just those two songs.
2,Pathetic effort.,"Funker Vogt is already quite well known with their electro-hard industrial sounds. While they haven't really made anything groundbreaking tracks, they have made some tracks that are catchy and hard. However, they skipped a step here with no decent effort. This is a remix cd yet the remixes are bland. I can not express how disappointed I was when the remixes only revealed slight changes or overdone distortion. Then again, the electro/industrial scene hasn't really been groundbreaking the last 5-10 years."
2,"""NO MOUNTAIN KING""???","I SAW THIS BAND WHEN THEY OPENED FOR THE ""BEATLES"" AND WAS IMPRESSED WITH THEIR RENDITION OF ""HALL OF THE MOUNTAIN KING""...MUCH TO MY SURPRISE (I SHOULD HAVE LOOKED AT THE TRACK LISTING MORE CLOSELY) ""HALL OF THE MOUNTAIN KING"" IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND ON THIS COMPILATION.THEY HAD A GREAT DRUMMER WHO WENT ON TO FORM A BAND CALLED ""MAY BLITZ""."
5,Blood Alley,"I enjoyed the movie, even though I have seen it many times, it is still an excellent movie to watch. Lauren Bacall and John Wayne are some of my favorite actors."
2,One of the worst John Wayne films,"Well, I guess I'm out of step with most reviewers on this one. I'm a great fan of the Duke, but this is one of his worst films. I didn't buy the plot for a minute. The scenes between Lauren Bacall and Wayne show zero chemistry. Frankly, much as I love Bacall's early films, she never quite made the transition from alluring ingenue to fully adult actress. This film is Exhibit A as to why her career never made it to the heights it might have. I don't think Wayne's conversations with the invisible ""Baby"" work either. They are annoying and don't add anything to the film. Finally, I have no political objection to using Caucasian actors to play Asian parts. In this case, though, using such familiar faces as Paul Fix to play the Chinese villagers is a major distraction and detracts from the realism of the film. So, unless you are determined to watch every film the Duke made, I would say not to waste your time with this one when there are so many better films to watch."
3,also WAKE OF THE RED WITCH,"Last saw Blood Alley on tv long, long, ago. I didn't even know it was available on video, but I will pick this up soon to add to my library. A good action movie.I THINK John Wayne also died in Wake of the Red Witch. Can we say that he 'died' in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance""?3/10/2004 JULY 2003? time sure flies. Just got the VHS (was looking for DVD, can't find). Great, better than I remember from tv. Not just action, there's commentary, and some of the Chinese characters are sooo stereo typed. Note the Chief Engineer is Nisei (2nd gen Japanese American, see GO FOR BROKE i think)."
4,Duke & Bacall. What more do you want?,"Sort of a strange film but, dare I say it, entertaining. Nicely made. This feels as if were made in between major efforts. Not one of Wayne's best but certainingly not his worst. For that, see (or don't see) ""The Conquerer"". The pairing with Bacall is very good. The two stars work well together and their interaction provides the story's framework and keeps things interesting.Just curious, are the Chinese village sets the same as those used in the Bogart film ""The Left Hand of God""? Now there's a DVD candidate.The DVD image looks good. Yes, the color is somewhat muted, but this film is around 50 years old and film stock from that period wasn't the best nor was it carefully preserved. Still, this film has never looked, or sounded, better on home video -- and at long, long last we have the full CinemaScpoe image!Duke and Bacall in an entertaining film. Microwave some popcorn and enjoy."
5,classic film,"Saw this on the big screen in the 50s. This is classic ""Duke"".Lauren Bacall is tops also."
2,Going through the Motions,"Pairing screen legends Wayne and Bacall sounds like the recipe for a must-see movie, but this adventure film lacks gusto and merely plods along amiably and predictably. Other reviewers have pointed out plot problems, and between the by-the-numbers screenplay and William Wellman's competent but mostly unimaginative direction, there's little tension, no strong characters, and no memorable dialogue. Thank goodness the two stars had their innate screen presence to help keep this film from sinking outright; that said, there's no chemistry between Wayne and Bacall. For that matter, Bacall is woefully underutilized here. Other problems: Westerners cast in Chinese roles and lame attempts at Pidgin Chinese humor. Some decent production design, albeit rather too studio-bound.Wayne, Bacall, and Wellman all did much better work."
3,ok read,I just became a Doreen Rainey fan I read a few all of her books I missed this one along the way. At first I hated this book. A very slow read and made me almost put the down all together. When the action finally took place I enjoyed the book. I just feel like alot of things went unanswered. Like what was up with the mom there had to be a story behind her drama other then her not having anything till she married.... The sub characters were ok both all there stories were left open. I hope there will be a sequel to this book to clear the air and answer some questions that were left up in the air...
1,provocative information but abysmal presentation,"If you've read Not By Fire But By Ice by Robert Felix then you'll find almost nothing new in this audiotape, in spite of the claim that it contains ""missing chapters"" of that book.Though I forgive Mr. Felix for the informal style of presentation (since he said in the intro to his book that he meant it to be an easy, fast read), I cannot forgive Laura Lee for a thoroughly annoying and unprofessional host/interviewer style. She interrupted Mr. Felix countless times. She'd introduce him or ask him a question, only to interrupt him in the middle of his answer, or start summarizing his answer before he finished giving it, or interrupt the answer to introduce a different topic or mention a related study... By the second tape I was yelling ""Shut up!"" at the tape player.Like others, I'd like to see a more organized presentation of the argument and supporting research. This tape is definitely not it. For the basic ideas however, read his book."
4,"Very good EP, but about the last they can do with this sort of irony","This is a great EP. It has a lot of the feel and tone of previous H.T.B. with some new direction that I hope to see more of in future releases. There isn't a stand-out song on here that I would say stands up against some of the better tracks on The Mechanical Hand, but this is a band I'll take whatever I can get from. The 4th track, ""Pizza Nif"" is what I hope the shape of things to come from this band, matching the signature electronics with some more organic elements. The last track was the only one that didn't do it for me, and I'm sad to say that I deleted it altogether once the novelty wore off. There is a TON of nostalgic references in everything this band does, and listening to ""TMNT"" seemed a little too much... it made the irony found in the rest of the EP, even the previous albums, taste as cheesy as this EP's namesake. Overall though, this is a good buy for anyone that likes something different."
2,Just Silly,"I'm sorry, but I just don't buy the hype anymore. Horse the Band definetley had something with R. Borlax, very unique and oddly brutal music, and the synth was pretty killer. But then The Mechanical Hand was drowned down with abrupt silliness an overall jackass quality to it. Then they release this EP called ""PIZZA"". They apparently ate some pizza in Chicago so good they had to write an album about it. Kinda weird, just weird. While it does carry some pretty cool jams along the way. I just can't get over the idea; It's about F**king Pizza!!! I mean, sure it's good. but musically, c'mon. it's just a stupid idea. I still kinda dig these guys considering their pretty tight musicians, but that weirdo vocalist just ruins it sometimes. Hopefully 'A Natural Death' Will pull out some goods, because this is just embarassing."
5,Nice Hat... Reputable Maker...,"I don't have too much to say about the hat.. it's nicely made and from quality rabbit felt to boot (you see a lot of wool hats out there, not fur felt). Because of the soft fur and foldaway ability you can shape the crown anyway you like every time you put on the hat. It'll hold it's shape while on your head and then pop back to normal (open crown) when you take it off.. ready to be shaped the next time you put it on. I'm a happy customer and have no bad comments other than don't expect it to be good in the rain.. it's too soft and soaks water up quickly.. but I'm sure rain isn't the intended use anyway."
1,These Headphones are Terrible!!!!,"My experience with these headphones has been nightmarish. The nightmare began, when I had to replace the first pair after the bracket that hold the earcups in place collapsed on the right side. When I sent them back under the warranty, Sony had the nerve to charge me a ""flat labor fee"" of $24.00. I called customer service and asked them what labor was involved since they were just sending replacement headphones, but of course I got no satisfactory answer.After receiving the replacement headphones, I thought the situation had been resolved when only after a month, I noticed a distortion in the sound coming from the headphone on the right side. Upon examination, I discovered that an electical short was in the cord itself. So, I had to send these pair back and now I'm on the third pair!My advice to anyone thinking about purchasing a pair of these poorly designed headphones is to steer clear of these puppies or you'll be sorry!"
1,THE WORST HEADPHONE...,"I bought this one an year ago... but it has been horrible.The design is so silly. It is really weak. After a month I bought it, one side started not to sound. So, I replaced it via Sony customer care service.Now... one side is making buzz...horrible horrible... don't buy this."
5,TO LISTEN IS TO LOVE!,"Give this extremely talented tenor a listen. All he needs is more exposure, there's no doubt. He would be sittin' on top if more people were familiar with him and his music. Listen and fall in love with his tender, pure voice ala Vince Gill. Not bad to look at either is Lorrie Morgan's better half! CHECK HIM OUT!"
3,How one person's decision sets off a chain of events,"Jeremy meets Maria at a party and immediately falls madly in love with her. But how does his wife react to such news? She throws him out along with the babysitter, who she is convinced he is also having an affair with.And that's just the beginning. Connolly introduces us to a host of characters, and tells how all these lives are affected by one another, not unlike a complex emotional chain reaction.I must admit I was expecting more humour in this novel, but I found it mostly filled with sadness. The sadness of rotting relationships, of possessiveness, of jealousy. Connolly still managed to keep me interested in how these people would end up. He just didn't make me laugh."
3,"Works ok, not great","With the satellite units, this is a nice base station to be able to tell the outdoor temperature. The documentation says the satellite units can broadcast to the base (this unit) from up to 100 feet away. Well, maybe if you live in a house without walls. I finally wound up sticking the satellite unit right underneath the window where I mounted this base station unit. So now I can tell the outdoor temperature without wires. I got a second satellite with the intention of putting it in our detached garage, which is 75 feet from the house. I've never gotten a signal from the garage to the base unit. So I leave the unit in the garage; at least I can tell what the temperature is in the garage when I'm out there."
4,well made unit,The unit seems well made and works very well. I replaced a smaller unit and like the larger numbers on this one. so far it works like a champ and am very happy I purchased it.
3,less power than an older model,"We had an older model and the old outdoor thermometer sends a much stronger signal. As I was following directions with the new units close together to initiate the signal, the ten year old signal from outside was overriding the new radio signal just inches away. The new remote does work and we have it upstairs as remote thermometer two. It's disappointing to know that the quality is deteriorating.We love knowing the outside temperature. The large print is easy to read and the thermometer is reasonably attractive."
5,Very Reliable,"I bought this same exact Thermometer 10 years ago. I defintely got my moneys worth out of it, but unfortunately, It recently bit the dust and I have been like a fish out of water ever since. I have friends that have different Thermometers that has the atomic clock and thermometers with all the bells and whistles and have had problems with theirs continuosly. I looked specifically for the same one that I had before and just purchased it again. It has been Very reliable for 10 years and I dont ever have to worry about the clock being set wrong or any of the added features messing up. Its very basic with low maintenace. You have to change the battery occassionally and you are good to go again. For a basic reliable indoor/outdoor Thermometer, I Highly recommend this product."
1,Not Reliable,I have owned two of these units. They both worked for a while (until the warranty ran out) and both failed. Both units will no longer display the outdoor temperture. Oregeon Scientific technical support was of no help.
5,Great Technical Gizmo!,"The Oregon Scientific wireless Multi-Channel Thermometer (ASIN:B00005NN9D) is terrific! I live in an apartment and have placed the remote unit on a table on my balcony. The main unit is on a table in my living room. I always know what the temperature is -- inside and out! How nice not to have an ugly thermometer hanging on the wall outside.I had a bit of trouble understanding how to set the channel so the unit would work, but I finally hit the right combination, and both the inside and outside temperatures were revealed on the screen. The numbers are large enough for even those whose eyesight is not what it used to be.This item would make a nice gift for close friends. I love mine!"
4,Works Great,"I have the transmitter set about 200 ft. away in the dog house. The receiver is in the garage with the doors closed, and it works very well. On occasion, the signal gets lost, and sometimes I have to take it much closer to the dog house to get a reading. I can then take it back to the garage and it holds (and changes) for several days without having to be moved.Overall, I'm very pleased with the unit."
2,Not as good as advertised,100' ha! I have it 10' and 1 wall away from the remote and it dosen't work most of the time. Besides that I'm happy with it.
3,Disappointing Accuarcy,"Upon opening the box, I noticed that the outdoor temperature was 1.4 degrees higher than the indoor tepmperature. I decided to let both units sit for several hours hoping the temperatures would stabilize. After 24 hours, no change. I contacted Oregon Scientific and was told that was actually good because each sensor is accurate to only plus or mius 2.5 degrees, so they could be off as much as 5 degrees total. Why provide reading in tenths if the thing can be off by over a degree? No mention of the accuracy in any of the specs I saw. Just a toy in my opinion."
4,Great machbine,"I use this device a little unconventionally, namely for monitoring the humidity in my guitar case. An acoustic guitar is sensitive especially to dryness so I put the cordless device in the case. I had expected the remote unit to be smaller but it still fits. The main unit can have three remote units attached, but comes with just one. I assume you can buy extras. Anyway, I really like the main unit for its superlarge font. You can see it from across the room. Well thought-out machine!"
1,J-U-N-K,The title of this review pretty much says it all.Purchased new with fresh batteries yet the main unitwas never able to receive a signal from the sensor. Noteven a 1/2 inch away!Garbage! Don't waste your $$$ on this one.
1,Does not work,"This is a totally worthless device. The base station will not display a temperature at anything over 3' from the remote sensor...and that's line of sight through a plate glass window. There are no other electronics in the area and the batteries are fresh. I've followed the directions to reinsert the batteries and reset both devices, but to no avail. You cannot get any help from Oregon Scientific because there is no means to contact a real support person...only a FAQ page. Do not waste your money on this piece of junk!"
1,Range not as claimed,I purchased this thermometer to replace a more elaborate La Crosse unit that I have had for several years. One of the main reasons I purchased it was the claimed range of 330 feet. When I installed it the receiver lost contact with the transmitter almost immediately. I do have steel siding on my house but the La Crosse has worked in the same location and the transmitter and receiver are literally on opposite sides of the same wall. If metal house siding precludes use of this thermometer I think that should be stated in the literature. I ended up returning returning the unit. Because of Amazon's great return policy I was out only time and effort.
1,Not what it claims,"I'm with M. Carstensen. The remote works only when within 10-15 feet of the base unit, not interference sources near, and through one wood wall. Beyond that, forget it. A rather poor range for the cost. This experience suggests Oregon Scientific isn't reliable -- or truthful -- when they claim up to 100 feet range. Email for help to Oregon Scientific customer service got no response. Save your money."
4,"Needed a bit of ""fine tuning"".","I needed to move the inside display unit so it could see the outside sensing unit through glass (a window). It had a hard time receiving the signal from outdoors through an exterior solid wall. Other than that. it's working just fine, and I'm pleased with it."
3,Should have gotten a more sofisticated one.,"The range says up to 100 feet. We had no signal 50 feet away and then also at 20 feet away. We ended up putting the receiver right outside the window where the display is in our house and we still lose signal sometimes. It seems to be when it gets colder that we lose signal.However, I wish I had gotten one that did more than just give you the temperature as my boyfriend works outside, he is addicted to the weather."
5,A work of art,"I hate to say this, 'cause Michael Mclean is accused by some of being cheezy, but I think this CD is a masterpiece. It really moves me every time I listen to it. I really think it's a masterpiece."
3,Other reviews are too generous,"Though the musicianship and recording are excellent, the content is wanting. There is a wonderful message, but it is partially obstructed by cheesy lyrics and repetitive passages. There must be a better Easter program out there."
4,ToC,The only hitch was the table of contents which its still easy enough to search for and bookmark it just doesn't appear as a table of contents in the goto feature
3,Grim,"These are not Mother Goose fairy tales. Most of them are repeats of other stories in the book. If these are the real versions, I can see why they got changed. I thought it was interesting to compare the familiar stories with the version I knew and the version in this book. This isn't light reading."
5,omg there's so many,let me just say i am NOT going to type out all these titles...there are 200 of them!!but some popular ones i saw were:cinderellarapunzelsnow whitesleeping beauty (little briar rose)little red riding hood (little red cap)Lots of others...but just too many...it's free anyway get it. im sure it will have what you're looking for.
1,Horrendous Formatting,Don't bother buying this one for your Kindle. The formatting is so poor that it makes reading almost impossible. I guess this is another case of you get what you paid for.
5,Still the Best,"I actually grew up on the German originals. While it is a little strange to read these tales in english, I still adore them. They were original and yes,educational.Most of the stories teach kids (and adults...) about the fact that each action has a consequence. Nothing wrong with that!Can't beat the Grimms!"
5,NEARLY FLAWLESS - PERFECT MOOD MUSIC!,"I have owned this CD for years, and about once a month I still have to throw it in the CD changer in my car. Listening to ""Miracle"", ""Safer Hands"", ""Outlaw"", and the obvious ""You Are Not Alone"" is such a TREAT. The backgrounds are almost always dreamy, but often make you think and ALWAYS put you in a different mood. Although criticized much, I dig the lyrics. Simple, and they make sense, but not too plainly. Personal note here: This is great beach music - this CD begs for steamy weather and for good times that are a bit sinister/seedy. All in fun, of course!"
5,star spangled mellow gold air,"another of my 3 favourite cds.pop songy, slightly dancey, mellow, trip hoppy, ambienty, acid jazzy, loungey, groovy, pretty, veryvery gentle breakbeat.similar artistes? it's a far reach to morcheeba, air, jamiroquai, single gun theory, incognito, brand new heavies, hybrid, strike, but i guess they are the closest sorts of musics.ok, so Olive is lovely music. very surround sound, surround harmonies and enveloping vocals. it is semi-mainstream...some of the tracks had quite a bit of airplay, but it never reached the point of public awareness that it should have. the beats are soft and mellow but not necessarily boring or slow. you would have heard ""You're Not Alone"", probably...dance mixes of it made for clubs.why do i like it so much? i'm not so sure. it's very, very pretty. classic cd."
4,Amazing!,"With Ruth-Ann's sweet and and often sultry vocals, this album is propelled from just great beats! At first glance, some of the lyrics seem a bit childish but with that voice, Ruth-Ann could make the phone book sound good! Every song is an instant classic on this album. Kudos to Olive for making pop music with heart, soul and meaning. And if you wanna ball out crying, just think of a loved one you've lost when listening to ""Safer Hands."" That song gets to me everytime! It is really beautiful and so is the rest of this album!"
2,Dried out,Dated trip-hop is neither offensively out of style or retroactively radical but instead merely offers a humble signpost to the blossoming sub-genre over a decade ago.
4,it drew me in at the start but left me wanting at the end,"Fortunately, this album contains some of the most incredible, hypnotic songs I've ever listened to. Unfortunately, it starts to falter starting with Curious. Songs like Miracle, You're Not Alone, Outlaw, and especially Blood Red Tears put me in a trance and make me forget what I'm doing. But then I'm hit with Curious, which is just annoying, and it doesn't improve much from there. Don't get me wrong. The first 8 songs on this album make it definitely worth owning, which is why I give it 4 stars. But I wish it would sustain me for the entire album like Massive Attack's Mezzanine or Hooverphonic's first two albums. If you like ""trip-hop"" (although different people define it different ways) and you've never listened to Olive, I would definitely give it a listen. But if the prospect of buying an album where only 2/3 of the songs are excellent makes you leary, I'd recommend picking it up used."
3,Okay quality,"after about 4 months or so this handle and blade began to loosen, needless to say I discarded the sword before it caused any harm"
2,Just for looks,"I bought this for a friend for his birthday. It feels solid, but beware do not use for anything else other than decoration. He was practicing swinging it in the air, when the blade completely fell off! The blade is not properly secured to the handle (not full tang.. just glued) on these sword. Even though it wasn't sharpened, he could have seriously hurt himself. using this sword as a decoration is the most you do with this. these kinds of swords are made from scrap metal, unsharpened and improperly balanced and/or not configured for use."
5,Great guitar showcase,"Django was probably the best guitar player ever, his playing is straight from the heart and at the same time very technical, flashy but sophisticated. It would be great to see him performing live. I was a true genius, a master of the instrument. Listening to his records makes me feel good, he really did justice to music."
4,Ayu Rocks,The original mix is very good but the remixes are not good. The only mix worth listen to more then once is track 2.
2,no 4 cells nor 60 min charge,it comes with 2 rech batt. only. 60 min chargr is for charging one single low capacity battery. very disappointed :(
3,"Good, but not great.","This atlas, in my opinoin, is pretty good, but not complete at all. It does give you a lot of maps, but only the ones you start off with, or can buy/quest - none from coffers. (Maybe with the exception of Castle Zvahl, I can't remember how you get that map)It does give you a fairly accurate list of monsters and nms along with reccommended levels and some pop locations. Also, it does have maps of towns with some usefull NPC locations. So, if your a beginner, I would definetely reccomend it, since it can get you around for quite a few levels, but the more experienced players don't really need it, unless they really want to save a few gil by not buying maps."
2,not what you need,The FFXI Atlas has some alright info in it but for the most part if you play the game you already know the info in it.it is kinda cool to have the maps but not worth the price.
2,Not worth the shipping and handling.... even if its free.,"To me an atlas should have all maps of places mentioned in its pages. I bought this thinking it would cover all the areas that I had access to. I understood that it was published after CoP was released so it probably wouldn't have those areas. However, all I really wanted was maps in sky and a few others. WRONG! Not only were the maps not included, but most the maps that I would ever really need were not included. Places like Gusgen Mines, Sky, Crawler's Nest etc seemed to be left out. What a waste."
4,Its useful and thats what matters,"Yes, ok, it doesnt have all maps, but what matters is it IS very useful, I play ffxi a lot and i use the atlas a lot, I recomend it to any player that can afford to buy it."
4,"Wish they would come up with a revised, new version...",My only complaint is that so much has changed since this Atlas came out...otherwise well worth the price for any FFXI lover :)
2,Final Fantasy XI Atlas,"Final Fantasy XI Atlas Help with the game, the book is out dated, I'd look on line, for updated information."
2,Upset with Shipper,"I'm upset that the shipper never got back to me about the return policy. It was the wrong edition, as there was no advertisement of what number edition it was. It arrived promptly, so that was one redeeming quality of the purchase."
4,Tori Miracle is likable and the local history is enjoyable.,"I am from Chambersburg,Pennsylvania. Death Pays The Rose Rent is a a very enjoyable book. Both the book and the author are delightful. Great job, Valerie."
5,there`s magic in my mind,i^m going to use this extraordinary music in my storei sale snoowcone in Mexicali b.c. Mexico.All of my store is decorate with disney sovenirs and cartons.
2,"Good price, Disappointing singers.","Be aware that the artists singing and playing these songs are not the same as in the movies or on the soundtracks. The overall production is less lush and more natural. I was surprised to find that I really miss the ""buttery"" emotive style of the highly-processed Disney soundtracks. The singers are certainly not bad, but to my ear they sound more like normal singers and normal songs, not like Disney characters singing Disney songs."
2,Ok... not great.,This set has very few of the newer Disney tracks and also all are taken straight out of the movies so often have long pauses where there's talking and no singing. Good if you like all the very old stuff but not at all good if you want to sign along to all the stuff your kid is likely to have seen in the last 10 years.
2,great songs poorly sang,"I am not a Disney fan, I brought the set simply because I like some of the songs offered. What a disappointment! Music is flat, and songs are sang by your average Joe and Jane! Coincidently, I brought this set along with Elton John's ""Greatest Hits 1970 - 2002"". Compare Elton John's version of ""Circle Of Life"" to this set's makes me want to throw this set out of window."
5,Finally the DEFINITE Collection,"In the previous 10 years, the Disney was releasing collection as a soundtrack for the On Ice performances, but never a full complilation. This box set of 5 CDs, is an absolute collection of Disney fans. All songs in this fantastic box set is based on all of the movies such as the Lion King, The Mermaid, Tarzan, and much more."
4,Essential,"I have a Disney music collection worth hundreds of dollars, and this is one of my most prized pieces. It is a closed colletion that is no longer available from Disney and is far better and more conprehensive that the current collection that they are releasing. Get it while you still can."
3,What?!!! No Reflections!,"Almost bought it, but... How can they not include the song REFLECTIONS by Lea Salonga from Mulan? wait 'till the next and more updated issue of The Disney Collection."
4,Um. These ARE the originals.,"I'm not sure where L. Tucker-Kellogg is coming from. These are the original songs from the movies or tv shows--original vocals, original instrumentation."
3,Where are The Rescuers?,"Why are none of the beautiful songs from The Rescuers ever included? Someone's Waiting for You, Tomorrow is Another Day, The Journey or Rescue Aid Society? These songs are very pleasant and better songs than many of those included in the set? The film's never been privileged with a soundtrack, while the horrid '80s or '90s sequel did, I don't get it. What's wrong with The Rescuers?"
4,lots of stuff !,"ALL DISNEY FANS WILL LOVE THIS NEARLY EXHAUSTIVE COLLECTION. ACTUALLY, 3 DISCS OF THE COLLECTION OF 5 ARE GREAT. SOME OF THE TRACKS ARE MERELY FILLER, IN MY OPINION.I WAS SURPRISED THAT MORE MUSIC OF FANTASIA WAS NOT INCLUDED."
5,Everything you need!,"My daughter and I love to listen to these cds. It seems that every great Disney song (through the release of Mulan) is included. These cds do not include tracks from the Tarzan movie or any of the most recent ones, but include many songs from The Little Mermaid, Alladin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, and all of the old favorites."
3,Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic,"This CD set covers songs issued only before year 2000. If a song has more than one version(sang by two different singers), this CD set only include the less famous or popular one. It is good to have this CD set but it is not the best Disney CD sets in the market."
5,Amazing,"I loved it! It has all of my favorite music from all of my favorite Disney movies: The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King! Although I have to say I didn't recognize some of the older songs and don't really jump for joy when some of the Mary Poppins songs play, I still really love this classic Cd set!"
5,Another Ace!!!,"As with everything that I've ever bought from Ace Uk, this is superb! The sound is great and the selection is diverse. The great thing about the Ace UK label is that they are not afraid to include the rare hard to find oldies that you may have missed along side the familiar tracks. I have NEVER been disappointed with anything that I've ever purchased from ACE UK. In fact, I've even bought compilations from them that I'd never heard before and was pleased with then. You can never go wrong with anything that they offer."
1,Worthless,"This was a waste of money. It was a little more expensive than my first model of pedometer but seemed to have some good features. Unfortunately, the step counter was completely inaccurate. It would rack up hundreds of steps while I was sitting at my desk. It would reset itself about two or three times per use. I had to check it every 20 minutes or so and try to keep a running total in my head in case it ""reset"" itself. I was so frustrated with the inaccuracy of the thing, I finally tossed it."
1,practically worthless,"To my great disappointment this gadget is a real hassle to use -- it frequently ""resets"" itself and the alarm is not well designed for any practical use in an emergency. Not recommended!"
2,"Great idea, not so great item",My husband purchased the Pedometer with FM radio for me. I loved it and used it non-stop for about a week. After a week the battery case top fell off so I could not keep the batteries in. The FM radio worked only once - I thought I had a short in the headset. Good idea but really did not perform/last for the money.
3,"I liked it, but....","I really liked the ease of use, the large, easy to read display and the many useful features, especially the blue glo light. My problem is the clip wasn't tight enough because somewhere along the way it fell off, never to be found and I only had it for 3 days."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This was a piece of JUNK. Neither my husband nor I could ever get it set correctly -- we wound up throwing it away, going to Target and buying one of their 10,000-Steps pedometer. THAT works great."
1,Price is cheap and so is the product,"The radio actually never worked on this pedometer, which was OK as that was really an 'added bonus'. However the pedometer itself has stopped working after two months of use. It hasn't been dropped, it hasn't got wet...it has just stopped. Perhaps it is the batteries, but it's such a plastic, little toy, I don't want to waste the money on buying new batteries. You get what you pay for."
4,Alabama's Greatest Hits Vol. II,This is a great collection for fans who can never get enough of this great group of performers.
5,They never let me down,"I have not listened to Alabama for a while and I had forgotten how good they are. I know they don't write all their songs, but Angels Among Usmade me cry. Randy has one of those voices that you just can't help but love. Thank you, alabama, and please continue to entertain me."
3,This is not a documentary,"Ok, I was looking for the much sought after documentary to see Joe Louis in the flesh, hear him speak, watch live footage of the fights. THIS AINT IT! You are better off going to pbs.org and getting American Experience: THE FIGHT DVD PBS Joe Louis.The actor certainly looks like a cross between Muhammed Ali and Joe Louis, the fight signs are just drama. To get a piece of history, this is not where to start your collection. But if you want to watch a 1950's movie which for me is way above my time, get it. Hope this helps"
2,Poor quality,I absolutely loved this set when we bought it.... then I washed it for the first time. I followed the care instructions and still had seams come apart. I hand sewed them back together and that's the extent of my sewing skills but after the second washing (I lined dryed this time) more seams came apart. I think it's because they didn't allow enough fabric past the point of the seem and some of the patches are courdoroy and they fray. Really disappointed as I love this set and designed the nursery around it. Going to be returning it.
2,buyer beware!!,I thought this was a beautiful bedding set for boys; something he can grow with. To my horror the bedsheet shrunk after the first wash and it no longer fits on my crib mattress. What a disappointment after spending $200. It is a lot of money to spend and still worry about shrinking sheets.
1,HORRIBLE... HORRIBLE... HORRIBLE,"I ordered this for my sons crib and it was the WORST mistake I've made!! After the first wash, it started to fray along the edges. After the 2nd wash, all the squares were coming apart and you can't sew them back because it would not look right. The little strings that hold the bumpers to the crib are horrible... some ripped completly off so that section of the bumper does not stay on the crib. I have had the set for 9 months now and i will be replacing it today. It is completely horrible. Looks nice but the quality of it is minus 10. For the price I paid for it, I expected tons more out of it. I could have gone to the dollar store and probably found something that worked better, that's how cheap this set is!!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED, do not buy and save your self the money!!"
4,Scrabble Works for Windows 7,"My wife plays scrabble online all the time. The online service she uses is not dependable, so I decided to buy her a Scrabble game. Unfortunately getting Scrabble rated for windows 7 is nearly impossible. I tried the ""free"" games, and they were not comparable to the online game she was used to. None of the available commercial games are rated for windows 7. I checked reviews of existing games to find one which would work on her computer, and consistently read good reviews about this game. The only real negative I found was the dictionary, but that was a minor concern. I ordered the game and it arrived by mail 4 days later. I installed it to her windows 7 PC with no problems, and it works as anticipated. That's exactly what I wanted. The price paid for the game was very reasonable. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to use it with a windows 7 computer."
4,Scrabble,I had this exact game for many years. The disk was damaged when the CD drive in my computer failed. This was purchased to replace the damaged disk and works exactly like the old one.
1,Had to disable Virus Program,I needed to disable my Avast Virus protection to get this to workThat does not seem right BUT THAT IS WHAT I Had to doI will not go through the trouble of sending back the discI will NOT buy from you again
3,"Good, but ""Cannabis Alchemy"" is better.","This book and D Gold's ""Cannabis Alchemy"" describe basically the same proccesses, but ""Cannabis Alchemy"" has better illustrations, more information, and more lucid prose."
2,It's too heavy!,"It might work fine, but it weighs 2 pounds! I didn't even open it. For a light traveler, 2lbs could be a large portion of your suitcase weight. Before buying, put some 2lb weights in your suitcase along with all your clothes & carry around the house a few times to see if you can manage this weight. I decided to try a full steam iron instead or go wrinkled!"
5,Fantástico libro,"Muy buena calidad, mejor de lo que esperaba y súper buen precio, lo recomiendo para quienes tenemos impuestos carísimos en nuestro país. Un tremendo regalo para un fanático de las motos."
5,My Mannequins,"Sydell Waxman, I hope you never tire of writing stories. What a great book about a young girl's imagination. We need more books like this for our young people to read. It is nice to read a story that encourages creative thoughts in a young mind but also to remind us to not forget our own dreams. Ms. Gallinger's colorful illustrations compliment the printed words. What a great combination to maintain a young reader's interest. The ""Historical Note"" is a wonderful addition to this story. One more fine book to add to my grandchildren's library. Thank you Ms. Waxman and Ms. Gallinger"
5,Books as your Tour Guide,This book made my kids so happy on our trip to L.A. and the amazing Getty Museum. It is charming and witty and serves as a bit of a treasure hunt at the Getty. (FREE MUSEUM!)
5,Walsh-Seibold,"This creative team of Walsh and Seibold (Olive, the Other Reindeer) has done the best museum book out there. The Getty Museum produces beautiful books."
5,Everyone should own this book!,"I wish I would have had this book when I first became 100% responsible for my dwelling! This book is practical and tells you how to clean, how to take care of and manage a household. Every teenager heading off to college, or newly married couple should receive this book as a gift into real adulthood!"
3,I love reading,"I've subscribed to this magazine for years. My criteria for whether I renew a magazine are based on how many pages I turn down in an issue. I go back through and cut out recipes, review websites, save articles and clip coupons. Which I love reading."
2,blah,"This book isn't very exciting. I was hoping it would encourage me to get going on the management/maintenance of my house. Instead, it was a snooze. Not really giving anything exciting as far as info and presenting it in a boring way. Might be useful if you have never ran a load of laundry, etc."
2,"Clever, and Heartless","BBR has gone a bit more poppy here, with actual dance beats. The vocals are exactly the same sort of unmitigated archness, intended strictly to present the lyrical 'genius' (""I want to be the new Diana"" - Is that what it's come to?), not to convey any emotion of course. In fact per usual, there's no singing at all, just the now standard non-melodic recitative cooing, pretty all in the same 4/4 tempo throughout. For me, good pop music represents an emotional & passionate investment by its creators, not an ironic, detached one."
3,NOT ALL METAL,"This lighter is not all metal like the description says, it is plastic, otherwise I love it. If it would have been all metal, I would have given it 5 stars, or if the add would have said plastic."
1,I'm not sure what you think this is . . .,". . . but it wasn't what I thought it was.I thought it was a handbook for how to study economics for those who wanted a really good education in the field: what books to read, what order to read them in, what sites to follow, what math courses to take and in what order, what government and business reports you need to keep up with if you want to remain current.Nothing of the kind! Instead, it's a summary of the major ideological shifts and controversies that have been happening in academic economics for the last 50 years or so. In other words, approaches to economics that you'll want to know a couple of things about if you're about to enter graduate school.But most of it is obvious and will be gotten from even a garden-variety economics text for freshmen. Did you know, for example, that there is a big paradigmatic rift between Austrians and Keynesians?Only about 50 pages, by the way. More of an esay."
5,great product at a great price,The toner was compatible with my fax machine and a much better deal than any office supply store. No problems whatsoever.
2,Skip-It,The printing quality left dark vertical streaks that I could not adjust through the printer. I cleaned the printer according to the manufacturer's instructions and still no luck. I'm going back to Brother's cartridge.
4,High Phrases and Low Places,"For Big Apple bookworms, this volume is a prize pick. Chock-full of fascinating facts, it has some of the tone and texture of Victorian prose while maintaining a modern perspective on poverty, ethnicity, and crime. The reader-to-be should be warned, however, that this pulp is no light read, and the employment of British slang, out-of-date terms, and otherwise esoteric language might be a bit hard to chew. But for those who crave juicy tidbits about old New York, the book is worth any amount of patience and persistence. Just keep a dictionary handy, and relish every word!"
4,"Great, readable intro to NY's wild years","As a resident of a santized, tamed New York, I find it hard to imagine the city that Luc Sante describes in ""Low Life."" Can't say I would prefer living in those crime-ridden and poverty-stricken days, but you can't help feeling a bit let down by the modern city reading about the colorful crooks and decadent nightspots of a hundred years ago. Sante has a real gift for making New York history readable and entertaining at the same time he conveys large chunks of valuable information. At times the sheer volume of names and incidents gets a bit tiring, but Sante's unique, world-weary voice will keep you reading past the rough spots. Highly recommended for anyone who liked ""Gangs of New York"" or who has a taste for truth stranger than fiction."
5,A must read for anyone interested in the origins of New York,"'Low Life', Luc Sante's gripping account of New York pulls the reader though 300 years of the city's shame and glory. Within minutes of picking up this book, Sante is able to chew up and spit out any notion of ""the good 'ol days"" and nostalgia. Low Life puts into perspective not only how New York City was, but why New York City is.."
5,egglite bulbs,for underwater applications and not readily available in local hardware stores until very recently (big orange now carrys them). kinda pricey but handy when you can't find them elsewhere.
2,Lockheed C-5 Galaxy,"I was a little dissapointed as I expected more on the C-5's production history and it's mission. Lots of Air Show and ""Canned"" Photos but none of internal views. Over 20 of the 80 or so page's deal with Aircraft other then the C-5. Does have a nice serial number list."
4,Excellent Tunes!!,"This is the first album I've bought from this tallented Finnish music powerhouse, but I loved them from the first listen. So much in fact that I went out and got Crucify My Heart later (which also rocks!) High energy beats, sexy, powerful female vocals, cool lyrics...need I say more? A must for fans of goth metal, especially Lacuna Coil, (similar high energy to Karmacode), Switchblade Symphony, Kidneythieves, ect."
5,Discerning Foodie,"I hope Dianne is enjoying her yacht on the Riveria. This book was so fabulous that I bought it for at least twenty friends and family. The book is extremely reliable, easy and very inspiring. You feel as though you are getting one on one cooking coaching. It makes cooking non intimidating and fun. I used this as my holiday ""bible"" and sailed through with rave reviews. The book allowed me to pace myself so that I wasn't wiped at the end that being the goal and beauty of this book. I would highly recommend this for an experienced chef as well as a novice. Great job Dianne. Many Thanks!!!! This will be a party classic for years and years."
5,Everyone Needs This Cookbook!,"No matter what the occasion, I am ""finally organized"" with excellent ""Do-Ahead"" recipes! At last, I can relax and enjoy my company and family! I plan to give this book as a birthday gift to my three grown children this year before their busy holiday season arrives!"
3,Kind of pedestrian,"I made the entire New Year's Eve buffet, and I was a little disappointed. To me, the flavors weren't zesty enough. The pesto was delicious including the artichoke pesto, but things weren't generally my taste and seemed kind of standard and heavy. And the brie bites didn't freeze or thaw well, and they really stuck to the tin even after spraying it with Pam as instructed.None of the food was bad, it just wasn't all that special.I love the idea of do-ahead, so I wish that this was a menu I could use again."
2,If I had actually looked at the recipes I wouldn't have bought it,"This book has less than a dozen photos at the very beginning and they're not that great of photos to begin with. I like to see what the dish is suppose to look like and I would think the food editors could have found a decent food photographer. The recipes don't seem to make sense with the holidays, like Father's Day is chicken fajitas and margaritas. Isn't Father's day about steak? and beer? That could have been any meal, nothing special about it for Father's Day. The paper the book is written on is matte finish, almost like cheap recycled paper and the print is not a dark black, some of it is actually hard to read especially where it's gray. I think the Sandra Lee holiday book is better or even the Celebrations book by Betty Crocker. Don't pay full price for this and certainly don't give as a gift, the polenta crust cheesecake was awful as was the marcapone berries parfaits. You can see why it's down to $3.00 used."
1,The Inner Game of Platitudes and Banal Observations,"I bought ""Inner"" with the expectation it would provide me with insights into how my personality impacts my investing decisions. I found the book to completely devoid of any useful insights.To give you an idea, ""Inner"" divides the human race into 4 or 5 ""types"". It then offers to categorize you and me and everybody in China by the simple expedient of answering 5 questions, one of which usually has to do with whether you are the oldest of youngest child. Suffice it to say that I have seen more rigorous persoality testing methodology in Readers Digest magazine. Having set up the categories, the advice offered was worthy of a horoscope column in the daily paper, i.e. vague enought to apply to anyone.""Inner"" was the most useless book I have read in quite a while."
1,A poor evaluation of investment psycology,The author examines unfounded and unscientific types of investors. The Weath Equation by Tanous is a scientific work on investment psycology. This appears to be a pop psycology take on people rather than a usable work.
4,Great product,I purchased my Tiger Tail on the advice of a friend of mine who is a long time runner. I was having problems with my calves cramping up during my walks. This product has helped me to stay on track by loosening my muscles before and after. I would definately recommend this product.
4,A must have!,this product is a must for anyone with IT band issues. I would not be able to play ultimate or make long hikes without it!
5,"""Love...that's a damn good thing to work with.""","Lee Gorewitz is a spunky lady of later years who cracks jokes, readily gives out kisses, dances to Bobby Darin in the hall, and occasionally doles out some harsh words to her fellow residents in the assisted living facility. Lee also has Alzheimer's, and a pretty severe case at that. Confounded by the simplest questions such as what her favorite color is, Lee occasionally puts forth her definite (abet jumbled) thoughts on matters such as love, family, and yes, even Brooklyn.This short but intimate documentary is a real gem, allowing Lee tell her own story without any assistance in the form of interviews with doctors, staff, or other professionals. The story she tells can be confusing the majority of the time, but hidden beneath those non sequiturs is a rich and genuine narrative of a winsome and spirited lady living her life to the fullest.A remarkable piece you shouldn't pass up."
5,Alzheimer's Disease sucks...but it CAN contain humor!,"Independent Lens: You're Looking at Me Like I live Here and I Don't is a documentary well worth watching. My dad suffered from A.D. Watched him go downhill, memory, words, manual dexterity. From living at home w/my step mom, to daycare at a V.A facility, until his placement in an upscale Alzheimer's facility. He roamed the locked unit, constantly asking to be taken home. I have to admit, I didn't really want to stick around too long when visiting him...I became so depressed. I'm very glad this video was created. I can totally understand Lee's inability to clearly communicate her thoughts. Frustration, humor, anger, intolerance, little gems of memories released when the synapses occasionally connected. Dance, rhythm, singing. A plethora of feelings. My dad died in a Catholic hospital, hospice of sorts. Like I said in the title...Alzheimer's disease sucks...but it CAN contain humor! (I laughed while watching this movie!) xo Dad xo"
5,well done documentary,"As a former caregiver of dementia patients and the daughter of one I felt this documentary was very well done. It really gives insite into how these people live their day to day lives and how the staff interacts with them calming them down, cheering them up and just dealing with the incomplete sentences they all have. There is a limited amount of activity you can get these patients to interact with and this staff was remarkable in engaging the ones they could. My mother was in a very good facility but I wish she could have been in one this well run."
4,Love the hard way,"Like most short stories this one is packed with drama, but not very descriptive of the people, so it is harder to picture the characters in the story.From the back of the book: 'Could he ever really belong to her?Garth Drury was so right for Kerry Mace in every way but one...and that one was called Miranda.""He'll never belong to anyone but Miranda"" Garth's family and friends told Kerry.The dead girl was locked in Garth's heart, and Kerry was locked out...and afraid of these memories.She would not believe that a ghost could rob her of the wonderful love that she and Garth shared...until fear, as dark as madness, began relentlessly pursuing her!'"
4,Adventures in Booga Booga Land,"I received this dvd in exchange for writing a review about it. It is a children's dvd about the Parables of Jesus. I have 2 six year olds who loved it.I think you have to be really careful when you are re-telling bible stories. You want to heavily guard against wrongly telling the stories, but also making them kid friendly. I think this DVD did both pretty well. I think it would be wise to take family time after each story and talk about what was watched.My kids would give this 5 stars but I would only give it a 4."
2,Adventures in Booga Booga Land DVD Review,"Both of my kids were excited to watch this. Each episode is about 15 minutes, and they all held my kids attention.The series are meant to be comparable to Jesus' parables. While we watched, however, we couldn't really draw any decent similarities. The stories themselves were a little bit random and didn't serve a whole lot of religious purpose, at least not in my kids' (or my) eyes. This actually distressed my 8-year old, because she was trying really hard to understand the ""point"" and to take a lesson away from it. They were very fun and silly videos though, and will possibly be watched again by my 4-year old boy. I give this DVD 2 stars.* I received no monetary compensation for my review. I was given the DVD free of charge from Book Sneeze in exchange for my HONEST opinion. These opinions are mine, and mine alone.:-)"
1,Don't Bother,I gave this to a friend for Christmas and was very embarrassed when it fell apart the very first time she used it!! It ended up costing much more than it's even worth with shipping! Huge waste of money!!
2,Exaggerated!,"The book is good in terms of analyzing a parrot's behavior. Good effort was made to produce it. But, are the solutions given in the book really work? Keeping in mind that many parrot owners will not go into group therapy for example for their pet!"
4,A Must for All Parrot Owners,"Oh how I wish I had read this book when I got my first parrot. Our lives could have turned out differently.This is a very well written, well thought out, and interesting book. As I begin to prepare to share my home with a parrot again, I picked this book up and it gave me some wonderful insights into the inner workings of the parrot mind. BRAVO!"
2,just finished reading the book...,"I must say I had high expectations, in part, based on the other book reviews (mostly favourable). The goo-goo ga-ga remind me of some movie reviewers who have yet to see a bad movie. If you want to get substantive knowledge about parrot behavior that can aid with your parrot(s), then this book is not it. This book is a rambling treatise ridden with generalities and few exercisable action items nor insights. The gist of the book, with careful annotation and qualifications, can be explicated in 1-2 pages. The author, by all indication, seems to be an expert parrot counselor who has significant experience and success solving ""parrot problems."" Regrettably, that knowledge does not translate in this book. There seems to be a more recent book by the author I will buy and take a look. I believe in giving a second chance. A third chance is another matter."
5,A MUST READ for any bird owner!!!!,"This is an amazing book! There are so many tips and suggestions for correcting or preventing bad behaviors in birds. The ideal time to read this would be before even bringing the parrot home, but it is a must read for all bird owners. The parrot world is evolving and new things are being learned all the time.....read it to learn!!!!"
5,very easy to understand,"this book helped me to learn about my parrots behavior,gave informed examples.i dont have a well behaved bird yet.....but this book has gotten me on my way"
1,A disappointing lesson in control.,"This author describes control and training techniques rather than techniques of understanding. These creatures are far too intelligent and compassionate to force them to understand our needs and our expectations of behavior. I have found that trying to listen to what your parrot may need and want - by simply paying attention to their movements and their eyes will get you much farther. An attitude of profound respect and love, will lead you into this bird's life, as opposed to leading you into a position of warden in this bird's mind."
4,Excellent,this book is good for both the new to parrots and the experiancedIt shows logical and correct ways to stop bad behavior before and after it starts...Gives grooming advice and tips..Is a great book...
3,"Useful book, but a bit basic","I think this could be a useful book for someone new to parrots. For me, much of the information was rather basic and much of it readily available online. Some of the writing was a bit awkward but it was mostly easy to read and understand (to me).I did notice a negative review in which the reviewer seemed to have misinterpreted some of the information provided in the book. To help clarify, when the author suggests 'dropping' a biting bird, it is meant that you drop your hand very slightly, an inch or so, to throw a bird off balance very slightly. You do not literally drop the bird. And when the author suggests pulling a tail feather when a bird bites, again the intention is just to very gently brush the tail feather or perhaps pull very slightly, simply enough to distract the bird, and not to pull enough to cause discomfort, certainly not to pull the feather out."
1,"Poor quality, structurally defective","First-look impressions were nice, just what I expected. BUT, after only two months, I noticed structural cracks down the middle of the two larger stands. The items I had on top of them were relatively light weight and should not have caused this issue. For the price I paid for these, I expected substantially better quality. I would avoid them in the future and would not recommend them to anyone."
5,One of my all time favorite sequils,"The Outlanders is one of the best books I've ever read, it's outstanding! Jaryd, Baden, they're all back to fight, or alli, the strange people from another world. Coe uses the perfect words at the perfect times to put you in the setting, he makes you part of the story. If you loved the first book, I garuntee you'll like the continuation just as much!"
4,$10 for an ebook that was published in 1998...,"I'm giving this a 4 star rating because it's a great book. I still have the paperback edition of this book and was thinking about reading the series again, but I don't read ""dead tree"" editions any longer. I wanted to load the series onto my Kindle and would have paid for the book again even though I already own it. But $10 for an ebook that is out of print is just insulting. You would think the publisher would look at this as an opportunity to provide (at a negligent cost to themselves) a book to a small but interested segment of the reading public without having to worry about things like print runs, remainders, unsold copies, etc... Nope. They went for the Money Grab.Guess what Tor? I got the book anyway. For $0. Way to look out for your authors."
3,Good but it could be better...,"The second book of the Lon Tobyn Chronicle is fairly good. It disappointed me somewhat. I believe by adding the ""Industrial terrors"" kind of destroyed the presence of this eye catching chronicle. I was expecting it to branch more deeper into the logic's of the first book. I believe the role of Meylor and her men that she commanded was a space filler in this 2nd book. The book could of flowed more smoothly if the story was focused more on/in/around Tobyn-ser. This story is good and kept me occupied. I look forward to reading the 3rd book of this Chronicle.stray1760@yahoo.com"
1,Disappointed,"The name of the songs on the album were very exciting.When I listened to it, though - it was all very synthesized. It was also scratched.Since I bought it at Christmas, I don't even know where my receipt went to. I've never sent a CD back, but I regret buying this one."
2,Not so good,"I don't like it at all. The plug is loose and whenever I tried to charge my phone, i have to push it really tight so that it charges."
1,Failed to work for Microwave,Guys Beware!!!!! This Convertors are failing within a week of use on GE Microwave(700Watts/110 Volts) for a 220V usage. I have to replace 2 convertors till date and still things have not improved. Avoid this product for use on Microwave.
2,Not that good,The product is not that good. It is not running more than 30 min. It is also creating problem with the device.
1,Check output voltage first...,I haved moved to China and brought my prized coffee make with...only to fry it when I plugged it into this converter. It was then that I checked to see what the output voltage was - it was 150V...not the 110-130 that may have been OK.
3,Low wattage products might be a concern ...,"We bought this for our recent vacation to Europe...it worked perfectly for a heater we were carrying to heat food for our toddler but it almost blew up the battery charger we were carrying for our digital camera. The adapters worked fine in Swtizerland, Italy and Germany."
2,There's a problem not mentioned here,"Two different places in this product's description say that it is recommended for use with hair dryers when traveling in foreign countries. That's what I bought it for. But the 50-watt minimum is a problem, because the package warns that it cannot be used with products that have built-in electronic shock protection (i.e., a GFCI). That rules out any hair dryer sold in the U.S.! I guess if you plug it in before turning the hair dryer on, the GFCI is going to get fried because it will not consume enough power for the voltage converter to work."
1,POORLY CONSTRUCTED,I TRAVEL ALL OVER THE WORLD. THIS ITEM HADTHE PLUG PRONG BREAK OFF IN THE VERYFIRST OUTLET INWHICH I INSERTED IT IN INDIA.END OF STORY ...
4,Great item and reasonable price,"Great product for use in Europe. I used this for my hairdryer and lucked out that a family member had a transformer. Important that you figure whether you need an adapter, converter and/or transformer depending on your needs. These help with general use items."
1,Poor Quality and overly priced,"The product is very delicate, you drop it once and the pins might go off and render the piece useless. They should have designed the pins to be more stongly attached to the body and to be able to support the heavy body-weight(Because of the heavy transformer inside).Also its overly priced inspite of the poor design."
3,Be sure that a converter is what you need,"This product is being unfairly maligned by many reviewers simply because they are not using it for the purpose for which it was intended. A converter is NOT for electronic products (DVD players, microwaves, etc.). It is for small devices that will be used for short amounts of time. For other equipment a transformer is required. Please do some research before you buy! This site provides an excellent overview of international electricity. [...]"
2,Careful what you use this with!,"This unit is not suitable for low current/wattage items. My wife plugged our cell phone charger into it...and that was the end of the cell phone. If you plan on charging devices, you probably will have the same reslts...buy something rated for 0 to 50 watts!"
1,cheaply made,"This converter and adaptor set is a great price, but you get what you pay for.... I was very happy with the product for the first few days of my recent trip to Europe. On the 5th day, however, I pulled out the voltage converter so that I could blow dry my hair, and I was dismayed to find the two prongs that plug into the wall had completely snapped off! Wet hair for the rest of the vacation. Don't buy this product."
1,Not for Electronics,Packaging states not for use with electronics. If your intent is to use for anything except hair dryer or curling keep looking.
2,Damaged product,"The voltage converter is not functioning as it should, convert 220V to 110V. The 110V is not uniform so the appliances are not working normally."
5,At last!,I have been waiting since the compact disk was created back in the early 80's. The quailty is great and so is the packaging. I have Dog Days/Red Tape on order and expect the same quality. Now all we need is Underdog and The Boys from Doraville to be combined by Gott to complete the collection.
5,ARS Great Sourthern Rock!!,"ARS first came to my attention with the LP Rock & Roll Alternative, This is still one of, if not their best effort. But they have some other great songs on their, other CD's. One of those bands that slid under most of us in their early days.Great Musician's and Well worht the Listen!!"
2,"Not bad, but...","I ordered this cd because I hadn't heard these albums in years. I'm glad I did, since there are a number of songs that I enjoy. That being said, however, I would certainly first recommend any of Waylon's music from the late 60's to around 1976. This cd is truly a hit-and-miss affair, and unfortunately the misses slightly outnumber the hits. Among the things coming out since his recent death, the expanded Live cd is essential. ""Music Man/Black on Black"" is fine, but if you don't already have plenty of Waylon in your collection, you should start someplace else, like ""Honky Tonk Heroes,"" ""This Time,"" or ""Dreaming My Dreams."""
3,"Good Music, Bad CD","Music Man was a good album an Black On Black was a fair one; however,this cd package was terrible in quality. It was making noises and skipping by the third play."
4,Dino stampers,"I got this for my 2 and 4 year old grandsons for Christmas. It's a very nice set with the exception that it has no lid, once it's opened. If it came in a different container that actually closed, I would have absolutely given it 5 stars. As versatile as people are though, my daughter-in-law used an old lunch bucket for nicely storing and easily transporting the set."
3,Christmas Charity Purchase,"This set was purchased for a little boy whose Dad is terminally ill. I've never met the family, but my heart went out to them. This 4-y-o boy is most likely delighted with this."
5,Bought as a Gift...,"I bought this gift for a 4-year old who is very into dinosaurs. I was looking for something inexpensive to give him for Christmas and this absolutely fit the bill. When it arrived, I was really surprised with the excellent quality and it looks like it would cost twice as much as it did. Great buy!"
3,Needs a lid,"My only gripe with this product is that there is no lid. My kids are always accidently dumping stuff out when they walk with it. Other than that, it is a pretty nice product."
3,Ok for short periods.,My grandson is only four. He did not know much to do with it....My fault...he was not ready for it.
3,Just Okay,I am bummed because we got this stamp pad for our four year old for Christmas and the red side of the stamp pad does not work. Unfortunately red is our favorite color so he was disappointed.The stamps are high quality and the box actually holds the stamp and pencils nice and neatly.
4,okay stamps,For melissa and doug I wasn't super impressed with these. The red in a very light ink so. I have aleady had to replace it. I do have 2 year old boy that has loved dinosaurs and these provide a creative outlet for him.
4,Dinosaur stamps,My 5 year old grandson loves dinosaurs and can name most of the dinosaurs and knows many details about them. This was a fun gift for him and he has enjoyed making pages/stories about the dinosaurs using these stamps. Overall a great purchase. The only negative comment I have about this purchase is that the stamp pad was dry when received and we had to buy washable ink.
5,Great for a wide age group,"We purchased this for our then 3 yo son, and he had a blast making pictures. He would use the stamps to make a story, then scribble away with the pencils. His older cousins enjoyed playing with this too, so it was great for group activities. We had no issues with stamps coming apart and have yet to run out of ink."
3,Not very impressed,"I was really excited when my mother in law bought this set for my son. But the ink pad didn't work, and the dinosaur pictures are starting to peel off the stamps after one use. The stamps themselves are fun, and worked great to make Dinosaur invitations..after i bought a new ink pad."
3,Purchased for 4 year old,The child that this was purchased for loves dinosaurs and thinks that this stamp set is great.
5,An inspirational book,"It was very refreshing to read HGB's letters and her approach to many situations. For those of you who are intimidated to write notes or want to write to someone of star status, you may find this book will encourage you to put pen to paper. And for those Cosmo readers out there, you will gain more insights into the great HGB."
4,Laughing already,"We had taped the program on choosing a Bishop years ago, and wondered if there was a DVD of the series. There was and we got it and love having it. It would be nice if there was closed captioning - those British accents are hard to understand sometimes for this colonist's ears !"
5,Must have,"Actually I bought Yes Minister at a book store while recuperating from a injury, This is a must have. It is hard to justify paying 60 to 80 dollars for something you will only watch once. But yes Minister is an exception. I am involved with politics at the local and state level. Yes Minister gets it dead on this includes politics in the work place. To save money I bought Yes Prime Minister online it is very good but not quite at the same level as the first series. However the episode dealing with education is priceless."
5,"Yes, Prime Minister: The Complete Collection","Saw a few episodes of this show on tv and just could not wait to receive this set. Perfect, perfect, in acting, writing, production. Loved it!"
2,Best show ever - but....,"I am one of the greatest fans of this series and I own the tapes and the Yes Minister series as well. When I recommended the series to a friend she started talking about some episodes I had not seen after she bought the set. So I immediately ordered the Complete Selection with the added episodes. However, I was so disappointed with the quality of the images. Dark shadows around the faces and when the people move you can see smears across the screen. It has the quality of a bootleg version. Not at all worth the BBC label. The effect is somewhat diminished when I run the episodes on my small screen laptop which is my only option. My husband and I had looked forward to have a good laugh together on our TV - but that is not possible with this set of CDs."
4,NO SUBTITLES!!,"I was extremely disappointed that the set has no subtitles. I think BBC should add subtitle to the set immediately, and replace the set to those who requests subtitles free of charge.The content of the DVD is great. The bonus features are great too. But for those who can't hear the conversation, please buy the book instead, or/and wait for a new release with subtitles."
1,Cannot stand laugh tracks,I watched all of three minutes of this well-reviewed series. I cannot stand programs with canned laughter. Others may not mind canned laughter the way I do and would therefore enjoy this series.
5,Very poignant to today's politics.,"This series is very funny and a little sad. The show aired in the eighties -I think- but the themes and the political discussions are much the same today as it was then. The tone is very cynical and so also a bit scary. It does not matter which party is in power, because they are both subject to the same rules and thus the same tactics to remain in power. In the show, there is a line used by the civil service that ""Prime ministers (politicians) come and go, but the civil service (bureaucrats)always remain."" I truly believe that the writers on these Brit shows are superior to any we have here the States. I could not imagine coming up with the situations shown here and making them funny. Its a very well written series. One word of caution... I tried to share this show with some friends and they had trouble understanding the situations because of the differences in British government and a few had trouble with the accents."
4,Great! Great! Great!,"THIS IS A REALLY GREAT PHONE.ITS SO HELPFUL SINCE ITS CORDLESS.THE ANSWERING MACHINE IS REALL EASY TO USE.THE RINGTONES TO THE PHONE IS AWSOME,MY FRIENDS LOVE THEM.AND THE BEST PART IS THAT IT CAN CHANGE THE FACE PLATE. THE ONLY THING THAT IS WRONG WITH IT IS THAT ITS NOT THAT EDUCATIONAL.I'LL DEFINETLY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE"
1,Stove Top Dissapointment,"I have used this type of stove top coffee pot for years, and had my old one for probably eight years or so.When I found this one I was happy to know I could continue to brew coffee atop the stove, my favorite.This coffee pot was a dissapointment. As soon as I took it out of the box I noticed the handle was a bit loose. Within a couple of weeks, the handle broke off. It was if it had been glued to the pot, as there was no hole into the pot where the handle was. The coffee pot is pretty much useless now, a big dissapointment.I hate to write bad reviews, but felt it only fair to tell the truth about my experience.Quite possibly, I received a defective pot and it is a chance thing.I will not order any more though on line."
2,broke the first 2 weeks,"the glass nob comes loose on this coffee pot all the time and the sping broke and oesnt hold the basket up..it ashame because it made good coffee ,, but this pot is not well made and a waste of money...make it better and it will be a good pot for the price, but not as it is....I would not reccomend this coffee pot!"
1,1 pot of coffee made and the spring detaches.,Very disappointing to see that after 1 pot of coffee the spring to hold the basket just comes loose. It didn't break off it seems like it was very poorly welded on. Will be seeking replacement.
5,I have to chime in about this great little coffee pot,"I was looking to get another one of these and happily found them here on Amazon.com. This is the greatest little perk pot and it makes cafe-grade coffee. Also, you can take it apart and clean every inch of it, not like the innards of a auto-drip. Also, you use less coffee and don't need to buy filers, so it's economical. I've been using my previous one for 10 years with no problems. I'm going to get another for a friend of mine."
5,A Wonderful Teaching Resource,"This outstanding book is a must for painters. Excellent examples illuminate LeClair's text in a way that makes perfect sense for artists. LeClair applies sound color theory to art-making and inspires at the same time. I find it an excellent tool for illustrating color concepts to my university students. It is a comprehensive look at many approaches to the use of color (not a guide, as many books are, to using color in the the same way as their authors). Highly recommended!"
3,Nice but did not fit,"The Tipperary is a nice helmet but they need to make it in an XLG size for those of us who are a skosh bigger than the LG sized helmet. The oblong shape fit me better than other helmets, just was too tight for me, unless I took out all the foam pads."
5,Great helmet,"Purchased one for my 7yo daughter, she loves it. It's not too heavy and doesn't make her head sweaty. I like it because it's very well made and super adjustable. Compared to some of the other helmets I've seen this one provides superior protection. A great investment!"
4,Futurama Slurm Can Playing Cards,"This was a gift that I gave to my friend for his birthday, and while I haven't really done anything with it, it has a lot of fun stuff listed on the container that tells you what's in slurm, which is fun, and it does look nice. My friend really liked it and thought it was neat."
3,"Good, except for all the F bombs.","I've been an AlterBridge fan ever since they've been a group, and couldn't wait for this live concert video to come out. Great quality, production, etc. My only beef is the profanity from Myles throughout the concert. Doesn't add at all to the show. Certainly this could have been cleaned up post production or Myles could have cleaned things up knowing this was recording live. Just my two cents worth. Take away the F bombs, and you get 5 stars."
4,oVER THE TOP GREAT,SUPER DVD. Like the group and the song selection. Sound quality and picture excellent. look forward to their next release.
5,interesting book,"i bought this book used as a gift. i already have the herb book and enjoy reading it from time to time. anyone who questions the validity of the benefits of herbs might enjoy reading parts of this book as it addresses each herb individually by talking about its history, uses, how to grow it, how to use it and other interesting facts. it is a pretty book as well and offers advice on where to buy, recipes, craft ideas for herbs.a good resource for being natural."
5,This is a Great Book,"Thank you so much for sending this book, as i need it for my work in help healing the sick.. I tell you friends that this book will keep you from the ""Which "" Doctor. GOD has made natural remedies that cures all sickness and diseases we see in the world today. Praise GOD for nature, that we may eat the pomegranate, and the spinach leafs, and be healed by their properties with GOD's blessing and grace."
3,A Mixed Bag,"This book has beautiful illustrations of herbs, a comprehensive listing of herbs, and suggestions of various ways one could organize an herb garden.It still left me disappointed, though. Why? I had been looking for help in how to make certain of my herbs grow successfully (this is half the sub-title, after all), and this book only gives general guidance on this front (""keep moist, drain well"").I have several herbs at home, and some grow tremendously and others are on the verge of death, and I had been hoping this book would give me suggestions so that I could get all of them to be healthy. It didn't. So for a general, comprehensive introduction to herbs, this book may prove very useful. But for my purposes, it wasn't as useful, and I returned it."
5,Fabulous!!!A must have .,Cannot say enough about how glad I am to own this. It has more than I would need to raise herbs. Concise. Beautiful pictures. Excellent reference source.
4,Great thorough product,"Very informative on most herbs. Conspicuously skirts around those herbs that should be used wisely (Cohosh, echinacea, St. John's Wart), but provides plenty of ideas and projects for the more common 'safe' herbs."
4,"Excellent, but...","This is an excellent book, but there are a couple of drawbacks. First, and most annoying, is the ordering of the herbs by scientific name. Makes it hard to find the herb you're looking for. Second, it's a large book, takes up a lot of space on the table and doesn't fit on all shelves.It has served me well enough, but I recently came acrossYour Backyard Herb Garden: A Gardener's Guide to Growing Over 50 Herbs Plus How to Use Them in Cooking, Crafts, Companion Planting and Moreand I have to say this is the book I would pick up instead, in retrospect. I may even buy it anyway. It's small, has all the reference information in this one (and then some), and more readily available."
4,Ms Colter's sense of humour shines.,"First Time, Forever by Cara Colter~Silhouette Romance #1464 ~ August 2000~Fabulous Father's Collection - August 2009This is a heartwarm love story about two people who find themselves drawn to each other, not only for their own need but the needs of the children they care for. Kathleen may be older than Evan, but he was worlds ahead of her in life experience. Both have children that depend on them.

Ms Colter's sense of humour shines."
1,APA Style Helper 2.0,"Definitely not worth the $40 price tag. This program is not very useful and doesn't integrate well with MS Word...you are better off buying the manual and writing you paper the old fashioned way. I wouldn't recommend this program, even if it was shareware."
1,Not worth the time or money,"Not helpful, much less time consuming to use manual. Take it from me, this product was a major headache and I ended up returning it."
2,apa style helper 2.0,"Great tool to use for new writers. It is a little hard to figure out the details of usage, but once figured out is simple to use."
1,Horrible,"BE WARE. This product was designed specifically for use with TINY mp3 players like the ipod shuffle (which is, in my opinion, another ridiculous product) and is not much use for anything else. The cord is hardly a foot long. I had to return it immediately."
5,A Rollicking Metafictional Tour-de-Force,"The other reviews on this page are well-put, but this novel is much more than regional work or a humorous look at the early 80s. What's it about? Everything. Mysticism, sex, and death. And it's hilarious. Because things are funny in direct proportion to their gravity. I can never teach a class on the American Novel again without somehow dealing with this book, and the sooner it's back in print, the better."
5,Awesome mask,"I'm six five and I have a large melon. The mask fits fine, and looks like a movie prop. High quality product."
5,Great Deal,This was my first purchase from Amazon and what a deal! I received a great savings over the retail price and the package arrived within a few days of ordering. Excellent experience.
2,Not what I expected,"I was so excited to get this book since I am planning my own wedding! Unfortunately, there was A LOT more writing and more wear than I expected from what I read on the description of the book from the seller. So, I am disappointed to put it into one word. If this book was in better condition, I would love it."
1,5 pound difference in 3 minutes.,"I used this once and came in at one weight. I stepped on it 5 minutes later, dressed the same way, and not having eaten anything. I was up 4 pounds."
1,Just works,"The older version of these brackets work way better than this ""new version"" I wish I had the old style. I thought this product would be the same as my other set."
5,I want more.,"These things are great. First I had a set for my DeWalt miter saw, then I used another set to install a stone cutter on my miter workstation to get it up off the ground. I want a few more sets so that I can mount other useful tools where my old back can make better use of those tools."
3,my thoughts,"These brackets are great if you have the dewalt stand. These are my second pair because I have two saws and changing brackets from one to the other takes time which I dont have.The only thing that I do not like is they don't come with the bolts to mount your saw to the brackets. I was not happy with that.If you buy these brackets be prepared to go to the hardware store toget 5/16""x 2"" carrage bolts........."
3,No Bolts.,"I bought these to put on another miter saw I use on the jobsite. I was a surprised to find out that it did not include the carriage bolts to attach the brackets to the miter saw. Other than that, they work great when you need to change saws on the same saw stand."
1,could spit fire so mad at Dewalt,"I'm so disappointed with Dewalt at this moment. When I bought my first Dewalt miter saw and bought the work station it comes with the four bolts to mount saw to mounting brackets. I just spent 600 for the sliding compound saw and ordered the DW7231 mounting brackets another 50 bucks to be able to switch out saws as needed and WHAT Dewalt doesn't put the four bolts needed to mount saw in the box. Now if you order the work station they put in the bolts, so if your ordering the mounting brackets why would they not put them in, this is a load of CROCK and a poor job by Dewalt. While I love my Dewalt work station and saws this really brings my blood pressure up. I'll have to stop what I am doing and put about 35 miles on my truck to go to town and buy four bolts and nuts that should have been in the box. POOR JOB ON DEWALTS PART."
2,They work okay,"I bought the whole thing a few months ago. It is very sturdy and especially useful to a woodworker like me with limited space. I have a large Bosch sliding miter saw fitted with the brackets. I am very pleased with the stand. Recently I've seen other stands, ripoffs of the DeWalt idea (who did they steal it from?). All of them have advantages, but of course the parts are not interchangable. I think the Dewalt brackets are obscenely priced, but what else is new? Don't worry about it. Just make sawdust!"
3,"Great for a DeWalt, so-so for a Hitachi","I have a pair of these mounting brackets attached to my 12"" DeWalt saw. Naturally, they work great securing the saw to DeWalt's heavy duty miter saw stand. Not only that, when I remove the saw and place it on the floor, they still provide a stable base; no rocking and a wider footprint than what the saw itself provides.I then went and bought another pair to attach to my Hitachi 10"" dual bevel sliding compound miter saw so that I can use it on the same stand. Unfortunately, while they are advertised to fit practically any saw, in reality they attach to the Hatachi with only one nut and bolt each. They just don't provide the impression that they will be as secure with only one attachment point. Once I saw that, I didn't even follow through and try them out. Eventually I will, but it hasn't been a high priority just yet."
3,Worth about half the price.,The bolts and nuts that mount the miter saw to the brackets are not included in the package. I made a special trip to Home Depot for the missing hardware before I could use the brackets. It's UNBELIEVABlE the four bolts were not included considering the high price DeWalt charges for the brackets. DeWalt must figure if we have purchased their workstation and need additional brackets they can charge what ever they like.
4,works fine,"I mounted a DeWalt 12"" slide saw to my bench with these and it worked just fine. The only problem I encountered was the bolt on the left front needed to be turned because it interfered with the 60 degree angle on the saw."
2,Much is missing,Take care when buying this CD that the song/s you are after is/are actually on it. There are about 35 songs listed in the movie credits and only 13 are on this album. Songs such as The Rain the Park and Other Things (The Flower Girl) are missing.You have been warned!
3,Kinda Dissapointed,"I just bought this CD & I'm kinda dissapointed. There wasn't that many songs from the movie! Three of my favorite songs in the movie weren't on the CD. The ones that are on there I like, but I am kind of disappointed."
3,Missing track,"When Lloyd gets ripped off by the old lady the song playing is called ""Red Right Hand"" by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds from the album ""Let Love In"". Hope I helped another get hooked on Nick Cave :)"
4,Good soundtrack BUT........,"This is a great collection of songs, however it does NOT include the main title song, which is SPECTACULAR! If you are looking for that song, it is by ""Apache Indian - Boom Shak A Lak"". Hope this helps... Look for it on Napster."
2,Incomplete,"As far as I'm concerned, if a soundtrack is going to be released, pretty much all of the songs featured in the film should also be featured on the soundtrack. This soundtrack, much like a lot of other soundtracks released on some medium, is incomplete because it does not feature certain songs that are of particular interest to a lot of people who have watched this film. 2 Foot O'butt Crack by Circle the Wagons, Boom Shack-A-Lack by Apache Indian and other great songs featured in the film are NOT featured on this soundtrack. And you wonder why people illegally download music!!!"
2,Song Not On Soundtrack,"To Pablo from Spain: The song that is played when her husband shows up at the end of the movie is called ""Can We Still Be Friends"" by Todd Rundgren. As you now know - AFTER having spent your money to buy the CD - it is not included on the soundtrack."
4,name of song when Harry & Lloyd leave diner,what is the name of the song playing in the background when Harry and LLoyd leave the diner in a hurry and Lloyd is peeing in the beer bottles?
3,Song when Lloyd meets Mary,"The name of the song is Flower Girl by the Cowsills, The soundtrack is awesome and brings me back to the good old days of funny Jim Carrey movies."
2,Eh...,"As mentioned in other reviews,there are way too many missing songs that should have been on here.There needs to be an up-dated re-mastered version of this re-released.A two disc collection would be great."
2,Not Complete!,"All right, it's understandable that with about 36 songs played in the movie, they wouldn't be able to fit everything into one disc. So there were two options the record company could have done:1. Release a two-disk set encompassing all that was heard in the movie, or...2. If their only option was to release a single disk, than they could have placed all the good songs from the movie (like ""Boom-Shakalaka"") instead of the ones that sound like uninteresting filler (I'm looking at you, the Proclaimers).As it is, it's a mix-bag of the lesser music played in the movie and some of the good songs (like Deadeye Dick's hilarious ""New Age Girl"").By the way, could anyone help ID a song from the movie for me? It's the one being played while Lloyd carries grocery bags on the way home and gets ripped-off by the old lady.I remember the chorus singing ""Long dark hand"". Thanks for the help!"
2,Song on the Plains,The song you are after when the guys have the blue on the plains is mmm mmm mmm mmm by the Crash Test Dummies
4,One of the best soundtracks ever.,"I got this soundtrack as a gift shortly after the movie came out which is almost ten years ago. I found it in my room last week while i was sorting out my stuff and I immedietly put it in my stereo and thought about recommending it to other people on amazon.The movie kicked ass, alsmost everyone I know still has this cd, or has once owned a copy of it and they all know and love all the songs. I recommend this to anyone looking for a good all around cd, most songs are good, not the type of songs that you easily get bored with after a while. Even the one, or two songs that I don't really like are bearable."
3,Crash,"The best version of ""Crash"" is found here. It is by the Primitives. There are some other good songs on this cd as well."
2,WHATTTTT!!!!!!!!,Oh This was not pretty. Only one good song. Get something like Spawn! Now that is a good Soundtrack. Please watch the movie instead of listening to this!
2,Most of the good songs are missing...,"I'm looking for the song that plays in the background when Lloyd knocks on Mary's door for the first time before he drives her to the airport. That tune also plays once more at the airport when Lloyd's waving goodbye to Mary from the car, before he crashes into the back of another one.I'd really appreciate if anyone could point out that song/tune to me.Thanks!!!"
3,This was a gift,"This was a gift for someone else, so I don't know how good it was or if it served the purpose."
1,be careful!,I am a long time Amazon user and after listening to this album I was motivated to write my first ever review.I bought this cd after listening to the amazon samples. The first 30 seconds of every song sounded fantastic and still do! What you don't know is that you will be hearing that first catchy loop throughout the entirety of each song.This is worst than boring! Its downright annoying!
5,Great collection of Miller instrumentals,"I've always felt that this collection is to make some kind of statement that the Glenn Miller Orchestra should be embraced in the ""jazz"" community. Anyway this disc is the perfect companion to the February 28, 1995 ""Essential Glenn Miller"" two disc set. Finally, why can't these compilations of old 78's have a few more seconds between them? Essentially we have a bunch of singles all crammed together, so why not let them have some breathing room. As I recall, the UK Beatles albums from 1963-1966 had a seven second break between songs. I loved it! It was like giving each song it's own spotlight. Oh, the days of one song at a time."
4,Works on most bottles,"Yes it does work on most bottles, maybe not synthetic, but HEY UPGRADE YOUR CHEAP WINE! Lol. but the best part is how many compliments I get. It's the coolest thing to have at a party of get-together. Everyone OHs and AHs over this gadget. So it makes a really fun gift too."
1,just does not work,"Worked fine ONCE. Then worked 2 or 3 times immediately after a full charge each time. Then just can't get a cork out. The chiller bucket works fine (no moving parts, no electricity required). Kept the bucket, trashed the 'non' opener..."
1,useless junk,I got this for a gift for the hubby.It was a disaster. It doesn't work at all ..Waste of money.
1,This product does not work.,"This product does not work. I've attempted to use this product several times. At best, it raises the cork 1/4 inch, and grinds the cork into the wine. Waste of money."
4,Nice gift,Grandaughter is a young adult starting to entertain and I wanted to add to her gadget supply. She liked her gift and it seems to work but the motor seems a little weak.
5,SO EASY,I ACTUALLY ORDERED THIS ELECRIC WINE OPENER WHEN I HAD SHOULDER AND IT WAS HARD TO OPEN A WINE BOTTLE. LOVE THIS PRODUCT - WOULD RECOMMEND TO ALL
3,Not for an elderly person with arthritis,"We purchased this gift for my mother who is 76 years old. She loves her occasional glass of wine, but often has difficulty removing the cork. She used this item 2 times and there it sits in the box. BTW the ""Chiller"" is nothing of the sort. We chose not to return it, as there may come a time when we have a gathering and need to open a bottle of wine, and then we can use this product. Not as helpful as we had hoped it would be. It really does not work well on older wines, the corks break and crumble. She can't drink ""box wine"" or ""twist-off cap"" wine, she is from Italy and that would be offensive to her. LOL."
2,back up electric corkscrew,"We have had one of these Oster wine openers for several years and have given several as gifts. They normally work very well, but this factory rebuild does not have nearly the torque as our old one and the switch only works if you hold it just right. We only got it as a back up because we can't believe the old one is still working. Luckly, the old one marches on."
4,Great Wine Opener,"I have now opened more than a dozen wine bottles and the opener performs flawlessly. It is quick, quiet, easy and inexpensive. My only reservation would be that the screw is not replaceable and experience tells me that the slippery coating on the screw will wear out and the opener will jam. I hope I am wrong. Time will tell."
1,"Drills into the cork great, but to good method for removing it.","Drills into the cork great, but no good method for removing it. Conventional cork screws give you leverage to remove the cork. This goes into it very well without providing that ability."
3,"Does the ""Wine Chiller"" Actually COOL Wine or does it just ""Keep it Cool""","To those who may have bought this kit....Does the wine chiller actually cool a warm bottle of wine, or is it just an insulated container to keep a cool bottle cool.If it does cool wine how does it do it ??"
2,Great Gadget while it Lasted!,"This opener works like a charm.It looks stylish on the counter.I have had it for about three weeks.I love that I no longer have tostruggle to insert a screw ina cork and then battle to removethe cork from the screw.I haven't used the wine coolercomponent. It appears a bitsmudged or what I call cheap.You might just want the openerwhich is on sale separately.Update: It is now just underthe three month mark. The openerwhirls but no longer extracts the cork.The charger no longer works. Instead offour, I have to take this product down toproduct down two stars."
5,Awesome product to have!!,"I bought this for my mom for Christmas because we enjoy drinking wine, but hate opening the bottles. The electric opener works great, and it's easy to use. Make sure you hold the down button long enough to completely pull the cork out. The chiller is also great. Just stick it in the freezer until it's cold, then put your wine bottle in it, and it stays cold for a good amount of time! If it doesn't stay cold then you're drinking it too slow! :) Great product!"
5,Everyone who enjoys wine should have one.,"Was given this item as a gift a couple of years ago and it has been flawless. Bought one for my father-in-law for Father's Day. He is 85 years old and is enjoying it's use. He previously used a lever style opener, but arthritis caused some problems and this Oster 4208 has resolved that issue. Remember, it's always 5 O'clock somewhere."
4,Handy corkscrew,"This is very easy to use and doesn't chew up the cork as much as my old manual corkscrew. It looks nice on the countertop,though I don't think much of the glowing red light at the top, indicating it is charging; it makes me feel like it's using electricity unnecessarily to make that light glow 24/7. I think this would make a great gift for that person who has everything and loves gadgets."
3,It'sl okay,"The bottle opener works perfectly and effortlessly. However the ""chiller"" if that's what you'd even call it is nothing more than a hollow walled bucket. There isn't enough room to put ice in there with a wine bottle and if you freeze the bucket it quickly thaws due to the open and hollow walls. I wouldn't recommend this product mainly because I don't feel it's worth the money. You would literally only be able to use the opener, and I wouldn't pay that much for an Oster opener.."
5,Awesome set,I no longer have to open wine bottles like a man I can do it like a sir / my wife doesn't need me anymore lol
5,Oster Electric Wine Opener,My daughter in law loves this. We are a wine drinking family and you would not believe how many wine openers she has gone through. My son says it is as easy as ever now to use this opener
5,super!,Perfect gadget for those of us who have trouble getting the cork out with a traditional cork screw. Works absolutely fabulous!
5,soooo easy to use,"I took a chance on this wine bottle opener because of the reviews...and I'm glad I did....I ordered 4 of them,one for me and the remaining 3 for gifts..I couldn't wait to see how well it worked,and I was glad to see it was easy and actually worked like it promised..I think I'm going to order a few more for Xmas gifts.I've seen them selling for a lot more than Amazon's price..The added wine bucket is a bonus,but,the opener is worth the price by itself.."
5,Love this product,This wine opener is awesome! It's super easy to use and charge and works really well. I don't think there's much more you can ask for in a wine opener!
5,Five start,This item is really nice. I recommend to all. It is absolutly lovely!! It was delivery early beside the wonderfull price. It was nice present!
4,wine opener,I have enjoyed using this product. My friends have been impressed also. What can you say it opens wine bottles and it gets the cork off easily when it is finished opening
5,What a deal?,This thing works so well. My husband was thrilled to get it. I can even use it with ease! Yea!
3,Not what I thought it would be,"I doesn't always work to take out corks. Sometimes it is great, other times half the cork sticks in the bottle. I will probably just use a regular wine corkscrew from now on."
4,Cool gadget!,"Cool gadget to have if you're a wine lover. I won't use it all the time, but it will be fun to bring out when I have guests."
2,I am not happy and considering returning,It never actually successfully removes the cork. after multiple attempts I have to get my old hand-held- wine opener to dislodge the cork. Very sad & disappointed in this product. It looks nice but doesn't work!
1,Didn't have the chance to open the advertised amount of bottles for a charge.,"This is a nice, attention grabbing opener. Unfortunately, it only can be charged once, and the sad part is that you realize this after Amazon return window expires, so you are stuck with a useless device.I've always been happy with purchases @ Amazon but I am very disappointed with this one and the retuen polcy.Guillermo"
2,doesn't always work,"don't use this on aged bottles (5 years or older). It will rip the cork apart. Works great on newer wines. The ""Wine Chiller"" is just a metal bucket."
1,RETURNING,"I bought this for a Christmas gift and we left it charging for 24 hours and it still did not have enough strenght to pull out a cork which we tried on both regular a cork and the type waxed cork. It would not fully charge. The light was still red after 24 hours, but we still tried it anyways. I will be returning it"
1,Quit Working After the Second Bottle,The Oster 4208 Inspire Electric Wine Opener With Wine Chiller quit working after opening a second bottle of wine. The cork gets stuck and it is impossible to remove. This was a gift and the receiver as well as myself was very disappointed. The product failed. Bummer for New Years Eve.Oster 4208 Inspire Electric Wine Opener with Wine Chiller
2,doesn't work on all corks,"This doesn't work on some corks- on others it works fine. So you need to have a bakc up in case your bottle of wine isn't compatible. That should be in the item description instead of just in the fine print in the directions in the box... I'm dissappointed.When it does work, its pretty neat I guess, not as fast as a rabbit type opener though... its plastic another gadget you don't really need."
4,Not bad but a bit pricy,"Some of the reviews I see say that it stopped working. Be sure that you check to make sure the cork isn't stuck inside as it stopped working for me when a cork jammed inside (would still work in reverse mode but normal mode stopped). Overall it's not bad and powers through all of the corks I've attempted to open it with fairly well. It will jam with softer corks which is a bit of a flaw but all in all, it's a decent opener. I just wish it was about $10 less for what it is."
5,Electric Wine opener,This product is wonderful this is the 2nd time I purchased the first time for myself the 2nd time as a gift I could not live without it!
4,electric wine opener,We've had good luck using the opener but missing from the box was the cutter to open the foil covering on the cork. No big deal. The price was certainly right!
2,save your money,This is a great idea if it only worked. About one out of every 3 times I used it I would still need a regular corkscrew to complete the job as it would break the cork half way through the uncorking process.
2,It works but it's really rather silly,"Ask yourself, as I should have, ""Do I really need this?"". I suppose if you have serious arthritis or hand disability. Otherwise, the trusty old fingerloop corkscrew is quicker, just as easy and takes up no counter space.Screwpull Pocket Model Corkscrew, Black"
3,Wine Opener,"This product looks cool, but works OK. It's hard for me to yank the cork out after the spiral cuts thru the cork. I have to get my hubby to pull it out. The wine chiller works OK. It doesn't remain cool for too long."
3,Manual Corkscrew wins,"Was not what I expected. Must have the wine opener position a specific way to ensure it works properly. Cannot just place over the cork and operate. Also, the chiller doesn't not keep wine cool very long. Something things I whether keep old school this is one of them back to the manual corkscrew."
3,Good product,"Great price. I am still getting used to using it. The only thing I dont like is that I have to push down the wine opener into the cork for it to actually make a hole in it, otherwise it won't work."
4,Cool bottle opener,Very cool and great for people who have wrist or hand problems since the opener does all of the work for you! My hands give me a lot of trouble and I cannot use traditional bottle openers... I love this thing!
1,Save yourself some embarassement if you think of this as a gift,"I bought this wine opener with chiller last Christmas and gave it to my friend. Next time we gathered at his home, he had a chilled white wine waiting for us. he tried to open the wine with this opener for the first time, in our presence, and he couldn't. I tried it with another wine and I couldn't either. We finally used another manual opener and enjoyed out wine. I told him that I will replace his gift with another, but he insisted that he liked the chiller and would rather keep it. If you think the chiller alone is worth the money, go ahead, if not save yourself some money."
4,"Good product but don't choose ""frustration free packaging"" if giving as gift","This is a very good product but it comes packaged in a plain brown box if you select the ""frustration free packaging"". This is a good deal if it is for personal use, but choose the ""retail"" option (which is a good bit more expensive) if you want to give as a gift."
5,Very nice wine opener,I recently saw this wine opener at a friends during a Super Bowl party and I knew I had to have one. I have absolutely no complaints about this opener it is a great value for the money spent and is so simple to use. I highly recommend for personal use and/or as a gift.
4,Good Wine Opener,"This wine opener has been operating very well for months now. It does a great job of removing the cork quickly and without mess. It comes with a ""chiller"" to put the wine and ice in. It stays charged for many uses and will recharge quickly. This is a good gift for someone that likes to savor the flavor of wine."
1,Electric opener does not work,The only part of this set that works is the chiller. The electric opener doesn't work on any type of cork!!!
2,sounded like a good product,"We ordered this for New Years as we had a large crowd coming and thought this would be great for opening all those bottle of wine! It sounded like a good product but sadley we used it once for one bottle and then it quit working. The cork got stuck and we can not remove it. The product would not reverse, we could not get anything up in there to remove it manually and now we can't re-charge it due to the cork being stuck. We are returning this and just using our existing ""manual"" one. The bucket did keep the wine cold though. We put it in the freezer for a few hours beforehand. We also liked the sleek look."
2,Not What I Expected,I have been disappointed with this product. I am going back to a manual wine opener. This opener does notwork on plastic corks which are becoming very common in mid-priced wines these days.
1,I was very disappointed! :(,I ordered this for my parents and was super excited for them to get it. Well...they got it alright. They didn't even want to tell me that it didn't work at all! After me asking numerous times about it they finally told me the bad news. They had taken it out of the box and it had looked like it had already been used and put back. They went ahead and plugged it in the night before and went ahead and tried to open their bottle of wine the next evening and nothing. It didn't even work. My super excitement turned into super embarrassment. They did say it looked nice. Ha!!
5,Oster 4208 Electric Wine Opener,This was a gift for my sister who drinks wine pretty often. She loves it and was very thrilled with it. The wine chiller is nice also. This makes a great housewarming gift.
5,Fast and easy,"Super convenient way to open wine bottles. No more messing with the rabbit corkscrew contraption, or waiters friend, etc. Even if you've been drinking a bit, there's little risk of messing up opening up another bottle with this bad boy."
5,very nice,"i bought this for my mom for christmas, i was skeptical because of the price but i bought it anyway, and it's actualy really nice, i was half expecting it to have that cheaply made look to it because of the price and it does not look cheap at all, my mom loves it"
4,Love it!,Purchased this for my husband & love it. Even I can open wine without his help! Well worth the price I paid.
2,Gift she asked for,"The receipe book came in more used than I expected but the price reduction was worth it. Since this is a gift for my sister, I can only comment on the pictures and some of the receipes are using parts of animals that sound surprisingly healthy and good!"
1,unscientific,"One of Deadly Doctrine's statements is that religion harms children. However, the great majority of scientific studies comparing children raised in religious households on one hand and less observant ones on the other show that the former group have better psychological adjustment. With regard to the question of religion's effects on youngsters, it seems that Watters' book is long on rhetoric, theoretical speculation, and anecdotal cases but short on hard data. The book is more a mouthpiece for Watters' militantly athestic views than a scientific treatise on religion's psychological effects on young individuals."
4,"O.K. Alright, Great Chic Flic...","And it is. The story is wonderful,The music is great. And Rick Springfield delivers. One of the few slash Love Stories I enjoyed. Lets face it guys at that time, Rick had it made.Top Hit songs,Acting,Looks..etc.This movie made me wish that I could find True Love like that.And go after it with all my Heart.You know, Really be her one and only Love Crazed Romantic.

3,HARD TO WATCH........,"No B.S. here folks,even Rick himself has admitted that this was a HUGE mistake..A weak script and tepid direction did nothing to challenge Rick to portray anything more than himself. The only cliche NOT used was a motorcycle....You've seen Sinatra, Presley and even Mellencamp play this part. All with varying degrees of success,you don't need to see it here. HOWEVER, the concert sequence at the end is solid,and while it does not save the film,it does serve to redeem Rick.Again,own it at your own risk...I would suggest pairing it with ""AMERICAN ANTHEM"" for a bad eighties flick double feature..The JIFFYPOP is on Me....."
5,AREN'T WE ALL HARD TO HOLD,"ALL US GIRLS ARE HARD TO HOLD!! SOMETIEMS OUR MEN DO NOT KNOW HOW TO HOLD ON TO LOVE THAT IS TRUE. I SAW THIS MOVIE YEARS AGO AND I JUST OREDERD IT AGAIN BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE THAT SEXY RICK AGAIN AND RELIVE THE LOVE AGAIN. AND TRY TO GET MY MAN TO BE LIKE RICK. HA HA SOMEDAY. ANYWAY I AM GLAD I FOUND THIS OLD MOVIE AND PLAN TO WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AND DROWL OVER RICK.CHAT LATER, KIM1202"
2,Hard to stomach is the real title of this movie.,"Hard to stomach is the real title of this movie. My wife made me watch it, and I find it hard to believe that somebody with that type of talent would make a movie so bad. The only saving grace was the music. Graham Parker is very under-rated performer as well as Rick himself. Buy the sound track and skip the movie."
1,THIS is already on DVD?!?,"Sorry, but when I came across this title and that it is already on DVD when so many of my old favorites are still only avilable on VHS. I am astonished to say the least.That and how well this is rated by viewers. True, the sound track is worth 5 stars - so go buy the soundtrack. This movie however is a turkey and was a huge disapointment to me as a fan and I was embarrassed for Rick Springfield when it came out, of course it didn't prevent me from watching it several times over.(oh, and I was 15 at the time) I still cringe when I think back to the bad script, the worn-out story line and who the hell cast Janet Elber as the love interest, was she cut out of wood!? This is Rick Springfield, he's sexy, he's talented and here he is unforgivably wasted.Do Rick and yourself a favor, look away on this one and go wear out the soundtrack instead."
3,You would have had to have been there....and had to have loved Rick,"Hard to Hold is one of those ""music movies"" where you had to have been a teenager in 1984 and you had to have loved the star in order to get anything out of this film.The story is pretty shallow and painfully drags on in places, and the leading lady was horribly miscast. Despite that, Ricks acting and the music carry it through and make it enjoyable for fans."
3,NOT SO BAD,"My friends & I were teens when this movie came out so of course we LOVED IT!! I bought a copy and it saw us through 2 weeks of no cable our first year at university. It has the typical rock star/love story, but it is upbeat and lighthearted. It does not do any of the actors justice as far as their talent is concerned, but it suited the times. I still am a fan of Springfield, but I think that anyone wanting to have a few laughs and a good time won't be too harsh a critic. I just wish Rick could find something to suit his matured acting abilities."
2,Rick is STILL hot!,"I LOVE Rick and that will never change but the difference between how i ""thot"" i felt about this movie i remember from my teen years and now are well.......kinda ""hard to hold"" in LOL......stick to the singing babe!"
3,"""Hard to Hold""","It's great if you really like Rick Springfield, but the story line left me a little flat. It needed more depth into the characters."
2,The Music Soundtrack's better,"First, let me just say I'm a HUGE Rick Springfield fan. I used to watch General Hospital in the '80's just for HIM. But this movie was a waste of his acting talents. The music soundtrack is much better. Save your money on the movie and order that instead."
3,"campy, plotless, but so much fun!","The acting is horrible, none of the characters are the least bit believable (no chemistry whatsoever) and as ""star vehicle"" for rick springfield it fails miserably - but the first third is so hilariously bad and misguided that I can't help but love this film (the last third is pretty great as well, I would advise everyone to just skip the middle part entirely) ... do you remember that scene in the video for ""jessie's girl"" when rick smashes his guitar into the bathroom mirror from several different angles and grimaces appropriately? if so, you'll love this movie too! I'm so happy this has made it to dvd, our vhs tape is almost worn out! (my sister and I watch it at least once a year)..."
2,started his downfall...,"From that movie on. I saw this movie when I was 13, and just remember seeing Rick running down a hall with a towel wrapped around him.. I got a chance to see this movie again after I bought it. Half the time he is kissing a girl or making love to her behind a wall after being chaced by a mob!This movie ... Poor story and lack of great actors... This was the start of his decline on acting jobs... After Rock of Life in 1988 there were no more hits for this ... teen idol... Rick even said that he made the wrong choice... I guess that he jumped in too fast....I have seen him in other movies that were sooo much better then this movie. My review is the same no matter how you slice it..."
5,Rick Springfield is a Classic,"Forget what the critics say about this movie, it's the all-time classic chick flick, especially if you're a Rick Springfield fan. He's still so sexy, even in his 60's!"
5,Good Movie and Good Music,I really like this movie and it has some great songs in it. Rick Springfield is really good in it.
4,I agree with the previous poster...gooood chick flick!,"This movie, I think, is very underrated. I enjoyed it alot as a kid and consider it a nice piece of nostalgia now. I still remember this girl in elementary school who used to see all his concerts with her mom and they'd wear the T-shirts and stuff...I'm definitely a child of the 80's...teehee...Anywayz, I would buy a copy of the DVD because I liked Rick's character but the plot was kind of lacking...still enjoyable, though."
2,Rick's so so movie,I saw this in the movie theatre when it came out and couldn't believe Rick did this mediocre movie at the height of his career. It's just okay and somewhat embarassing in parts. Also the lead actress was totally miscast...I had trouble believing that his character would fall for her...Rick could have done better than this but I bought it on DVD when it came out being a Rick fan...I LOVE Rick on GH when he appears though!
3,It's not as solid as seen online,"Quick delivery. Just not as solid as seen online. It's highly polished, but it's not worth $26. Beautiful though."
4,"Dark, grimy tales from the slums of New York City","Mobb Deep always used the studio to report from the battlefield (Queensbridge). What you get on this album is dark, realistic street-tales over grimy, scary beats. The music gets less grimier on some cuts, but it soon gets dark again. This CD is very good, but I can't give it five stars. The production on some tracks gets too dark and too slow, and damn near boring. Prodigy is a little overrated as an emcee. He is not bad, but he's not THAT good. His voice gets rather annoying, and he doesn't even rhyme all the time.Nevertheless, this is very good album, and it contains one of the best songs in hip-hop of all-time. Namely ""Shook Ones Pt. 2"". I recommend this album to anyone who enjoys underground hip-hop. If you began listening to Mobb Deep when Hell On Earth or Murda Muzik came out, you may not like this album. But give it a try, alright?"
1,Love Mobb Deep--Hate Amazon,"The Infamous is a classic album. While Mobb Deep may have jumped the shark into mainstream rap, their sophomore effort still stands the test of time as an essential East Coast/NY hip hop record.My 1 star review is for Amazon and false advertising. Nowhere on The Infamous' page on Amazon does it mention that this album is going to be shipping without album art--it comes in a black sleeve. I'm not saying that the cover is essential to my listening experience, but if I'm gonna pay for something, I'd like to actually get what I paid for."
5,THE GREATEST GROUP OF ALL TIME,BUDAMMONK YOU NEED TO STEP OFF DOG...MOBB DEEP IS RUNING IT AND YOU ALREADY KNOW THIS PUNK.
1,UGLY RAPPING,"Mobb Deep can't flow. Their rhymes are so choppy i don't understand how anyone can even listen to them. If you really want something good out of Queen's then get Illmatic or I Am... by Nas, or even Noreaga's new joint. Even southern emcees can flow better than these two guys. Anyone can talk about the ghetto, but it's not rap if you just rhyme when ever you feel like it... there's got to be some order to it."
5,One of the best CDs ever,"This is easily in the top 5 rap albums ever put out. Virtually every track on this CD is amazing, if you are a rap fan and havent heard this album you havent heard sh*t.Best Tracks-Shook Ones pt2-Survival of the Fittest-Right Back at You"
4,Great,Only complaint is the pictured album cover is not the cover on the vinyl. I don't know if the original pressings had it or not but my reissue has a generic black cover with the red labels. Aside from that obviously a classic hip-hop album from start to finish no need to explain there.
5,RaW,Another one of those LP's to pump in ya system when its overcast outside. The lyrics and beats go hand and hand. The perfect combination of these two makes this a must own!
2,Economics Professor Review,It is sad that with all the melt downs and the coming melt down we still teach our young adults garbage like the IS-LM Model. The multiplier is in there and all the other Keynesian nonsense and propaganda that has lead us to failure. After our latest financial failure has played out we need to remove these fairy tales from our text books and teach praxeology.Central planning always fails.
1,Jazz riff? More like broken record.,"Found this book in a bin outside a dollar store. Thought the title looked promising. Wrong. It's the most pretentious pile of horse wallop I've tried to read in a long time. If it wasn't such a long drive back to that particular dollar store, I'd throw it back in the bin it came out of."
2,Interesting Subject Matter Boringly Handled,Would love to see better filmmakers handle something like this. The film chronicles strange and wondrous man-made structures but never really gets to the heart of what drives such unique and painstaking creativity. The makers of Scrap could have certainly taken a lesson there. I once saw a 22 minute episode on tv about the maker of a hotdog stand shaped like a hotdog that was more entertaining. Advisable only for background watching. Pity.
5,"""This is some of their best work""","This is a great CD I went to buy it as soon as it came out, and I loved it. I still listen to it all of the time. I thought that it was great to hear some of the other ladies sing on this album altough CoCo has a nice voice the other ladies have nice strong voices also. The catchy tune ""It's really all about you"", ""Use your heart"" and many other there was not a bad moment on this cd. I though that LeLe and Taj did a excellent job on their leads and they deserve a hand!!! I wish that they would get back togeather so that we can hear some real r&b music from a real female r&b group, but if they have to get new members to put the group back togeather like Destiny's Child and loose some of their Chemistry I would rather just listen to their old tunes."
3,Nice follow up,"Not as good as their first LP ""It's About Time,"" but has its moments -- ""You're The One,"" ""On & On,"" and ""Fine Time"". This CD is the most forgettable one out of the their three album trilogy."
3,it was alright,"I had this CD years ago casue these girls can really sing and but really, this album is nothing special after Use Your Heart though I had the first part of the album on heavy rotation back in the day. Same story with the Release Some Tension album. I would just get a greatest hits from them because all their best singles are on those and these girls have great singing skills."
3,Changed too much from the debut,"SWV's second album had some good moments, but they tended to change too much in the style. As with most artists wanting to mature on their 2nd album, this album suffers in trying too hard at doing that. You have to have balance, that harder edge part and the maturity part, on a follow up. Use My Heart and most of the ballads as well as the funky numbers lack the street edge of their debut. The Allen Gordon songs are better than the Brian Alexander Morgan ballads. They should have saved this for their third album, which succeeded on most levels to me. It's a hard risk for most artists to follow up a very successful debut like It's About Time, but this album isn't as well remembered these days and that shifting of styles drags the album down."
3,A mediocre album,"Nice and solid production with 17 tracks. Good voices, nice songs, butnothing too special. It's a good record, but I couldn' point you one songout right now. 1996 BMG. Produced & written by SWV themselves."
3,Cut and Dry,"I don't know what I was expecting from yet another 'true crime' book on a notorious serial killer but I walked away knowing the story of the crimes but not nearly enough about the person who committed the crimes. If you want just the facts you'll be satisfied but if you're looking for either an edge-of-your-seat read or insight into the mind of Dahmer, you won't find it here."
3,nothing new,"If you know nothing about Jeffrey Dahmer and want to know which crimes he commited and how he did it, this is the book for you. But if you have read other books about him, don't bother.The facts presented in this book are accurate, but it's such a shame that you don't get to know who Jeffrey Dahmer really was, nothing new about why he did it, his psychology. Okay, maybe nobody knew who he really was, but the author could have at least tried to give us something new.Although I believe that Milwaukee is interesting doesn't mean that I want to know its complete history! It just went on and on! After a while you know more about Milwaukee and Bath than Jeffrey Dahmer ever did.I guess that books like this one are written because of the fascination for serial killers. Although nothing new is said, the author knows that people will buy his book. And that's a shame."
4,Dahmer Book Review,"We were assigned in English class to read a true-crime novel and relate to Shakespeare's murderous drama, Macbeth. I chose to read about Jeffery Dahmer, the psycho serial killer that murdered sixteen people and sometimes would eat his victims. The ""cannibalism"" was enough to get me really interested in the subject. The Milwaukee Murders describes in chilling detail all the events that occurred in the chamber of Jeffery Dahmer. This was one of those books that you couldn't put down. It offered a ""Silence of the Lambs"" theme, it was like Jeffery Dahmer was a real life ""Hannibal Lecter"". This book was great I wouldn't recommend this book for everyone due to its graphic nature, but it is very good for the people interested in serial muderers."
1,The Milwaukee Murders,"Too general, repetitive and inaccurate. The author actually repeats the incident between the police and the 14 years old Laotian boy four times, without adding anything new. It describes more the history of Milwaukee and every neighborhood in it, than the actual murders."
1,the milwaukke murder,"I cant believe I spent money for this book. I have never in my life read such a poorly written,dull inaccurte, dry book. If you want to know about the rubber industy, the beer industry, Milwaukee this is the book for you. If you want to read about jeffery dahmer it is not. When the author finally talks about murder it is nothing more than a poorly written, repetative,dull paragraph."
4,Inhumane wickedness,"Here we have a good book which finely represents the iniquities committed by an ill man. Well written which kept me tied to the book to find out more about how the crimes evolved. A story, which not only jolted me but also, had a forceful impact on Milwaukee. A real report which uncovers the secrets behind the killings. Recommended."
3,The Jeffrey Dahmer story,"Actually,I ordered this book by mistake,intnding to buy a different book about Jeffrey Dahmer.I must say,the peoplr at Amazon were just wonderful about it. They helped me get the order canceled and the money was put back in my acct.just like they said."
1,ITEM FELL APART!!!,I RECEIVED THIS BOOK AND IT WAS SO OLD AND WITHERED THAT IT FELL APART AT THE BINDING AS YOU TURNED THE PAGES!!!
3,"Okay, yes, it did wander, BUT...","If you are looking for the gory details and the basic story of where he came from, and who and how he murdered..then this is the book for you. I did stop reading it after the ""story"" rean out..I wasn't interested in the rest of the book..cause you gotta stick to the murders, man! haha! I know...it sounds sick...but you true crime readers can understand! If you want to read a great book about a serial killer...read the Genese River Killer (Arthur Shawcross). Good one."
3,not as good as i expected,I guess it is hard to write a book about a serial killer that didn't leave any survivors. I was looking to learn more about what Dahmer did between the time he invited a victim to his house to after he dismembered them. There was little about the actual killing ritual.
2,Could've Been Better,"Many of the ""facts"" contained such as dates and events were inaccurate. It was published very close to the trial, and it seems that the writer worked so fast to get something out, that he paid no attention to the accuracy of the content. If you really want to read something accurate about the man behind the murders, read ""A Father's Story"" by Lionel Dahmer. If you enjoy reading a story based on sensationalism, this book is OK. It was entertaining to read, but so is ""The National Enquirer.&quot"
1,horrible,"This book starts out like it is going to be interestin and then after the first chapter it starts getting really boring. It tells the same thing over and over. First he takes home the boy and then drugs him and then cuts up the body. That is all it says everytime, it doesn't go into detail. The ending is really boring i could barley finish it. He gets caught durin the middle of the book and the rest is just trial crap that is really not intersting."
1,Poorly written and not worth your time,"Ive never gotten mad at a book before i read this one. For example at one point i had to look at the cover of the book to make sure it was jeff dahmers story, cuz the author spent more time talkin about the history of the towns and cities dahmer lived in. And as far as describing the crimes he commited they were very vague and undetailed i recomend against this book."
3,Decent. But not the best book on Jeffrey Dahmer.,"I finished reading this book in about a week and thought that it was not as bad as some of the reviews claim. The author does tend to ramble on at the begining of a few early chapters about the history of Milwaukee or Jeff's hometown, but it's not as bad as one might think. Buying this book along with 'Massacre in Milwaukee' is the best way to go, as both books contain detail that the other doesn't. And with the low price of both, you can't go wrong."
3,Good...,"This book went way too in-depth with the history of Millwaukee and town of Bath. It was almost like a history lesson that didn't seem to relevant to the story as a whole. The rest of the book was an interesting true story. I didn't get the edition that talked to Dahmer after he was jailed, however."
3,amazed and confused,This book gives great detail into the life of Jeffrey Dahmer's life and the sick crimes that he committed. The thing I did not care for in the book is that it would go off on history of a town or an area and continue for the entire chapter and it left you feeling what does the towns history have to do with Jeffrey and his killings?
4,"Something to Sink Your Teeth Into, (No Pun Intended)","Jeffrey Dahmer certainly was a serial killer that will forever be etched in America's history--not the sort of notariety one might seek, but so goes it for the tragic life of Dahmer.I have always been intrigued as to what made this man do the heinous acts in which he committed upon seventeen unsuspecting victims. Most of what is reported in this book was just a small fraction of what most of us heard or read about in the news, at the time Dahmer was arrested. In fact, I learned a great detail of the life of Jeffrey Dahmer. It gave me chills just reading the words knowing what was going to happen, and powerless to stop it.If you have children, love them and nurture them so that this tragedy never occurs again in human kind! Outstanding read!"
3,To much info,While the book was ok. It gave a lot of backgound information that wasn't needed and it bogged down the story. To much information about the communities and the police politics were given almost gave up more than once on the book.
3,Be aware of errors,I used this book for a research report. It covers the basics of the story but sometimes wanders a bit off topic. Be aware that many of the dates of incidents within the text do not match the timeline in the back of the book.
3,"Ok, but there has to be a better book out there.","My review isn't going to be much different from the others.I have become quite fond of true crime books, and this was the second that I have read. I knew very little about Dahmer before reading this book, and I found much of it to be very interesting.Unfortunately, the author has prioritized quantity over quality. It seemed to be loaded with all of the bare bones of the crimes, but contains very little meat. It also seems he relied on geography and the history of the regions where Dahmer did his deeds as filler. Believe me, there's plenty of it. I could almost swear that entire paragraphs were duplicated throughout the book just to take up page space.I'm not a great author myself, which is why I haven't made an attempt at getting paid for it. The fact of the matter is that most of the book could have been written using tourist brochures and local newspaper coverage of the crimes as the only resources."
1,not as advertised,"The wrought iron tissue holder delivered was not the same as the one advertised. The shape was somewhat the same, but the detail was completely different - it wansn't twisted as shown."
4,More of a vocabulary than a dictionary.,"If you do not know Arabic script this dictionary will be useless to you.It's one word definitions (English script to Arabic script and vice virsa) make it more of a vocabulary book than a dictionary. Very good for general meanings but it may be a bit difficult if you can not conjugate words. It offers no assistance with pronunciation.VERY handy picture dictionary containing Arabic & English words -- categories: fish; flowers, fruits & seed; Islamic architecture; birds; butterflies & moths; cloud types; medicinal herbs; reptiles; vegetables and human anatomy.It serves it's purpose and is not as overwhelming as a full blown dictionary.A concise pocket vocabulary book - approx. 14 cm x 11 cm x 4 cm."
3,One of the few RPG's for 3do,This game has a lot of issues. The scrolling is very course and to be quite honest after several hours it became just too repetitive for me. This game is no the best rpg for the system I would have to say AD Slayer Deathkeep is much better. But since this is the second best RPG you might want to give it a try. I personally could not play this game with so many better RPG's out there. Try Killing Time its a hell of a lot more enjoyable.
1,huge mistake,"It was a huge mistake on my side of deciding to buy it. First of all we waited for 3 and a half months to get this delivered. then came the belt breaking issue. this is the fifth time in one yr that the belt needs to be replaced. guys! do me favour. please go for some other brand. Please Please Please. I 'm wondering what to do with this now ,especially afer investing a huge amount.:("
1,Good vacuum gone bad,"I bought this to replace an old Sears cannister vac, and initially had very good impressions. Except for the non-retractable cord, the unit seemed to have all the features I wanted and more. However there seems to be a basic design flaw when using this vacuum with low-pile but denser carpent, the brushes generate so much resitance against the carpet, the belt will burn up in minutes due to slippage. So far I've replaced 4 belts on this unit after only a few months of use (maybe 2-3 hours total use). I can't recommend this unit and am in the process of trying to get a refund for it."
2,A Disappointment,This vacuum was a real disappointment. I expected a much better product from Panasonic.The plastic elements break easily and the 'bagless' dirt container is a REAL bad idea. Trying to empty and dispose of the dirt is a chore of it's own.I had a Hoover Wind Tunnel before buying this vacuum. I knew almost immediately I had made a mistake buying the Panasonic. The Hoover is worth the few dollars more.
2,Belt will break resulting in costly repairs,"I purchased this vacuum about 6 months ago and used it about 10 times and 2 belts broke on me. One of the belts is easy to replace (part costs $2.50 at a repair shop) but the second belt I couldn't fix and the repair cost e $39.00. The cost was mostly labor because the 2nd belt was so difficult to replace.This vacuum works well but I don't think it's built to last. Power is good.Talking with the repair man, he advised against purchasing this model because if the rollers break on this model, the part alone would cost around $60.00. The rollers in the front is not built very strong and it does look like it will break in the year(s) ahead. If it breaks again on me, I'll replace it with a better model.Well, I learned my lesson. I will invest a little more in my next vacuum purchase."
3,good vacuum for hardwood and light carpets,"I purchased this vacuum and found it ok. It is good on hardwood except for the fact that the suction hose is on the side of the brush unit which means you get great suction on one side and ok suction on the other, they really need to put the suction hose in the center. On low pile carpets it does a good job. On high pile carpets it is very hard to push because you cannot adjust the height of the rollers and they dig into the pile making it hard to push even though it is a medium weight vacuum."
3,"Design Errors - burns up belts, hard to empty","This may be a good deal if you get it cheaply enough. But in only about 2 hours of use it has burned up two belts and plastic cord holder snapped. Consider the $2 belts and your labor to replace them part of the cost. Dust bin is a mess to empty and it's virtually impossible to get the embedded dust out of filter. When it works, it cleans well. Just a pain to use something with so many irritating flaws. A Yugo, not a BMW. Doesn't Panasonic design well and test for usability any more?"
2,MDR-EX81LP,"The sony EX-81 is the best noise reduction low bass producing ear phones I have ever tried but the fit is horrible, the over the ear hoops are a ""one size fits all"" approach and are not moldable. I would recomend the EX-71's instead it is the same as the 81's but without the hoops, they tend to stay put fairly well durring activity despite the lack of over the ear band."
2,"Good Sound, Bad Fit","This was a replacement for a similar Sony pair of ear buds I had but without the over the ear ""clip"". I found them totally unusable for me, they keep falling out of my ears because of the over the ear style. The sound was great, when they stayed in, for the price, but had to give them to my wife who doesn't wear them over her ear some how. Style may not work with you physical ear size or shape."
1,Terrible,"These are the worst sounding headphones I've ever listened to. I previously had a cheaper pair of Sony Earbud headphones that kept falling out when I went running in the gym, so I thought I could upgrade to these. Huge mistake. The sound quality is so bad I honestly think the pair I got might be defective. It really sounds like I'm listening to a tin can connected to a string. It's hard for me to even believe that Sony would put a product this bad on the market. And I'm not even looking for something with super high quality - I'm only using them in the gym anyway. I'm going to go back to my cheaper headphones - at least they sound OK. DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES."
1,Buyer Beware,The construction materials are substandard. With normal usage over 1 month the wire insulation turned to a consistency of playdoh leaving the wires completely exposed. Sony needs to address this materials failure.
2,"Excellent Sound Quality, HORRIBLE cord quality/durability","A warning about the long term durability of these earphones: the cord will ""break down"" and eventually develop a series of holes in the rubber casing exposing the wires within. I am on my 2nd pair and will not purchase a 3rd. It has taken maybe 6 months each time for this to happen. This is with what I would consider normal use with my Ipod. I love the sound quality, but the durability makes these unbuyable in my opinion."
3,Not for those little-eared!,"I love the Sony earbuds, I have another pair that's just the earbuds, without the back of the ear support. It has excellent noise cancellation, does not stress the ear at all (the bud is very soft), and without blowing your eardrums still has a fair amount of bass carried over. The one main reason I didn't give this model five stars is they are too big for my ears and don't fit or stay at all. I ended up having to give them as a present. There should be at least a size suggestion; for example, no one using the smaller ear bud size should use these, or even a length of ear requirement. Considering they are still moderately expensive, a size suggestion should be placed on the website."
4,great fit,The earbuds fit snugly and come in 3 sizes. The ear clip is nice for those few occasions when the earbud is either pulled out or works its way out and you can't get to it quickly (like on a motorcycle at 60mph). The only downside is the replacement expense. $10/pair plus shipping. That knocks it down a star.
3,"Clear but tinny, not real secure","I'm a 5' 5"" female of average size and the ear clips are larger than my outer ears so the only thing holding them in my ears are the buds. When first trying them, I thought they were extremely tinny and had a horrible hiss. Looking at the bare minimum instructions, I saw something about them having to be deep in the ear to appreciate the bass. With much effort, I was able to get them deeper in my ear at which point they became less comfortable and the hiss went away but they're still on the tinny side for me. The sound is very crisp and clear and you can hear the individual instruments but they just don't give the music the ""rich, warm"" sound that I normally enjoy from a mediocre set of headphones."
1,One Size does not fit all,"The ear ""wrap"" is not adjustable and is not able to sit on my ear. Even trying to use the smaller ear buds, the headphones simply try to come off my ear and I wasn't even running yet. I couldn't get them to stay in my ears even walking around the house. These sit in my junk drawer as well."
2,Why did I waste my money?,"Annoying. Thats how I can sum up these headphones. The sound quality is good, but the claim of comfort is a sham. They must have been designed for people with monstrous ears because the ear ""loops"" are suspended in mid air when I wear these, which defeats the purpose. I'd be better off with just the ear buds. Additionally, managing these things once you take them out sucks. They very easily get tangled. Its a headache. I wish I would have spent my money more wisely. Goes to show that the more expensive headphones aren't necessarily the best."
3,Only Pretty Good,"These earphones are really only so-so. They tend to be a little ""bassy"", so I had to boost the upper register in my MP3 player's equalizer. The fit could be better- believe me, I spent a lot of time trying. I prefer the fit of my $7 Sony ""h.ear"" earphones to these. All in all, these are really good $20 earphones- too bad they're $34![EDIT] I just purchased a pair of Razer Pro|Tone m100 earbuds- MUCH better fit & sound than the Sonys! Forget these and buy THEM!"
3,You get what you pay for...,"I use these as a cheap in-ear monitor for performance. For me, they are *adequate*, but I'm sure most musicians would disagree and say they suck.For home use, they sound far better than other buds I've tried. I have a difficult time getting stock buds of any kind to stay in my ear canals, but these lodge very well. I rotate the over-ear pieces until they touch the tops of my ears, then seat the buds in the canals, and that works well for me. The extremely soft buds seal to your canals to attenuate ambient sounds.The glaring deficiency here is that Sony doesn't provide a lapel clip to relieve gravity strain. If you have one laying around, it will be invaluable to using these.If you want flawless sound reproduction across the audible frequency spectrum, then don't expect it from these, *or any* earbuds. You'll have to spend hundreds on molded in-ears or studio reference headphones, period. In this case, you get what you pay for, and you don't pay much."
4,Great buy for the price.,Good earphones for a modest price. They have decent sound but not more than that; you get what you pay for. The rubber attachments for inserting into the ear are easy to loose if you aren't careful they come off quite easily. Do not leave them in a pocket to be washed by the washing machine they will not work well afterwards (I learned the hard way).
2,Bass is not good,I was very excited to buy this product at the price of $32. Read reviews and decided to buy. I already have the headphones came with my ipod and compared to even those this one did not have any bass at all. If you are looking for the right bass then these are not for you. pretty slick and stylish..but did not deliver what I was looking for. Ipod headphones still works better for me.
4,"Very good sound quality, weird design","These earbuds simple sound amazing. The bass exists, and is quite powerful, I had no idea earbuds could do this. I was so used to cheap 10-15 dollar ear buds. I finally broke down and got an Ipod Nano and wanted some nice black ear buds and these fit the bill. They are great. Be aware like other reviewers mentioned, if you dont stick them IN your ear, a snug fit you wont hear any bassOnly bummer is they are designed weird, they fit great in my ears but the part that goes up and over my ears doesnt fit well, bows out a bit. And one cord is longer then the other, but its designed to go behind your head, which is a great design (I think thats the point) but the wire is still way to long.Enjoy them, best bang for the buck."
2,Would not recomend,No adjustment for ears. They are way too big and the sound quality is poor. I really wanted these to work too!
3,Just OK,These ear buds are average. For the price they are great. Sound quality is not as good as the ipod ear buds. But you usually get what you pay for.
5,Met Expectations,"The Sony Bud-Style Stereo Earphones are just fine, all that I expected and at a moderate cost."
1,Im kinda an audiophile,I am not impressed at all. they dont fit in my ear at all. there is no bass. a little crackly when they get into the upper volume. and not a fan of the different lengths of the cord
4,good,"Unfortunately my pair was stolen somehow inbetween the time it was delivered and when i got home. The U.P.S. site showed the time it was delivered (only half an hour before i got home) but it wasn't there. I tried the pair that my friend got a few days before and it worked great. Should you buy it?: Yes they are perfect earphones, just turn the volume down or you'll be deafened."
2,don't waste your money,"I would like to say that the $32 I spent on these headphones was worth it, but that would be false. I am very disappointed in headphones and the sound quality. I recieved these headphones 2 days ago. I used them once and they are now a backup pair. The fit is not bad as long as you sit in one spot and don't intend to use these for running. I have an older pair of Sony headphones that are listed on Amazon for 1/3 of the price that are much better. If you really want to throw away $32 go ahead and buy these. I gave them 2 stars only because they are better than the tourture devices(headphones) that came with my IPOD."
1,Not satisfied,I have seen in the specifications saying extra bass but there is no bass at all. I am totally dissatisfied by this product.
1,awful,the ear hangers are not adjustable and the wire is split making one longer than the other.i wish i hadn't bought these
4,they work,"These are some of the better earbuds out there. They don't hurt (as some earbuds do), and the wrap-around feature keeps them in your ears (for when you decide to overreach the length of the cord).The nicest thing about is the length. I can now listen to the radio on my desk and still reach the drawers in my cubicle without having to take them off. Wonderful!I would recommend these to anyone who has suffered the standard length of earbuds."
4,Excellent headphones-but watch out for warranty issues!,"This is the second set of identical headphones I ordered. The first set was great-nice fit on ears, good sound quality, etc. But... one side quit working about 3 months after purchase. I called the distrubutor through whom I had purchased the unit. They said there was a 90 day parts & labor warranty on the phones. I was about a week past that date, so they would accept them for repair, but I would have to pay the labor cost. The labor was just about what I had paid for the phones through Amazon! So, I ordered another set of phones but I am not happy that the original set was not replaced. I hope that the second set holds up better than the first set!"
2,Sony MDR-EX81LP,Ear buds does not fit snuggly even with the smallest ear piece attachment. Ear hook does not hold in place.
3,OK - I'm not crazy about earphones.....,These earphones are better than most. They stay on your ear and are comfortable but tend to pop out of your ear at times. They come with three sizes of cushion so I should try the smaller one before I complain too much! The sound is good.
3,best earbuds yet,"After reading most reviews I decided to buy these (at the mall). The ear ""hanger"" is way too big for me, but it may fit you. And I also get the best seal from the buds when the hanger is actually hanging off my ear...which does not work well since the hanger then pulls on the buds. Also, they may be pretty comfertable in comparison to hard plastic earbuds, but these are by no means comfertable compared to over the head headphones."
5,a good bargain from a trusty brand...,"i of course went to nyc's own j&r, but this model was sold out and they were selling them for $38.99. for a few dollars less, i got these through the certified amazon seller AOnSale. the bass is nice, treble is rich and it sucks out a lot of outside noise and distortion. very handy for public transit! furthermore, they have earbuds that come in 2 sizes and they stay pretty snug on your ears."
2,Good sound /Bad fit,"Mixed feelings here,the sound is good and the noise reduction is good, but the fit(unless you have very large ears)is not good, the design needs to be altered for the piece that fits around the ear in order to provide a more secure fit, then this would be a great value for the price.If you have HUGE ears this is for you."
1,Sony Bud-Style Stereo Earphones,"I also purchased this item for Christmas for my granddaughter. She didn't actually hate it - the earphones didn't seem to fit her ears properly. They would not stay in her ears even while standing or sitting still. The purpose of them is remain in the ears even when jogging. So, I did have to return them."
2,not a fan,"Like some of the other reviewers mentioned, these are not good for people with smaller ears. The hanger that goes around the back of the ear is useless for me. I only wear these when walking to work, and I'm constantly having to shove them back in my ears. It's very annoying. Having said that, the sound quality and noise isolation are pretty good (the only reason they get 2 instead of 1 star). So if you're not using these while moving, they're fine. Hopefully there are better options though. I will be buying another pair for my commute."
4,good bang for your buck!,"these headphones are amazing! when i played em with my ipod the were just giving a fantastic sound!the only problem was that, i felt that the bass of the headphones could be a LITTLE heavier, but otherwise these are really good especially because its only 30 bucks! these even competed on a good level of sound compared to the apple ipod in-ear headphones, personally the apples worked well for me because i have and average ear hole, i dont know about you guys, but they were great!"
5,Ear buds,"Have had a hard time finding earbuds that fit my little ear holes. These work real well, because the smaller buds fit great and the over the ear clips don't let them slip. The sound is very good also. The price was right, and the overall quality excellent."
4,"Nice sound, comfortable fit but lacking some adjustments","I bought these to replace a pair of Sony earbuds I had lost. I wanted quality sound while I exercised, primarily running. The sound is very good, and the package comes with three different sizes of earpieces to compensate for various ear sizes. These help the buds fit snugly into your ear. Everything is as expected except for the wrap around the ears. Its very thin and flexible plastic, and can't be molded or adjusted for a tight fit. The thin straight bar between the bud and ear wrap has a tendency to move as you run, so the wrap would ideally hold it firmly into place. To their credit, they do hold the bud to your ear just not very tight, so you loose some of the fidelity of the sound. Bottom line is that they work and I have music when I run, just not the high fidelity I was hoping."
2,"Good sound, but horrible fit","I owned the mdr-ex71sl for about 2 years and loved them. When the cord ripped, I figured I'd try the mdr-ex81lp. Wow, they suck. Sure the sound is as good as or slightly better than the 71's, but I cannot get these ear loop things to stay put. They fit weird, and stick out and up. My ears aren't strange either, these things just dont fit. I have no idea what these people are talking about in other reviews about how great the fit is or how they stay hooked around your ears. My advice, if possible, try a pair on and see how you like the ear loop thing. I'm going back to the mdr-ex71's.Oh, and major thanks to Amazon for the super smooth return process."
3,Earphone Rating,The performance of the earphone is good but there is no way to adjust the fit. It just have to fit or not. Very limiting for some users. Also the metal stem where it connects to the rubber ear clip is very fragile. Mine seems to have become loose.
2,Good sound. Bad Chord. I do not recommend this product.,"As most people are saying: The sound is wonderful, but the chord is flimsy. I have just gone through my second pair now due to the chord becoming soft and disintegrating. I suspect this is because of sweat as the first two areas to show decomposition is the chord behind the neck and the chord near the ear.I've yet to try the SHURE e2-c but they're only $25 more than these. I've seen the chord on the e2-c and it feels much sturdier and thicker. Perhaps they will not succumb to the same problem as these.Accordingly, I do not recommend this product."
1,Terrible Fit,I had high hopes for these earbuds but they fit terrible and when I run I keep having to mess with them. I would go with a different brand/model.
4,Really good head phones for Running,"This is my second pair, the first pair just got worn out by my 14 year old son. I really like these for running as they stay in my ears and the sound is very good for buds with excellant bass.My first pair had an issue with the rubber fraying but the second pair seems to be holding good.Good for noise reduction but be careful on the street :-)thanks,Jim"
1,A total waste of money.,I bought these for my ipod Nano to work out with. The sound is tinny without any bass. Sony has a cheaper set of wraparound ear phones that are 1/4 the price of this piece of junk.
1,dont worth the money...,"im was excited about the idea of get a replacement of my sennheisers mx 500 for my ipod and what can i say... those headphones are made from cheap plastic, very unconfortable, they are nice mabe for being seated in the office or your house but things where u have to move your head.. NO way!... i relly dont like those headphones i prefer the 10 bucks sennheiser without, the sound attenuation that those.. and about the sound... the dont sound great, too much bass... i dont know why the people are so bass addict!!!! this is the first review that and i make in years of buying in amazon i dont write in english very well, but after throw away 30 bucks in this crap i really need to let some mesage.Im not a certified audiophile but i can feel the difference of sound range between this crap and my others sennheisers (mx 500, px 100 and HD497) even on my old panasonic cd player headphones.."
1,Terrible,These are the worst earphones I have ever owned. Not only are they uncomfortable the sound quality sucks. The best thing about these earphones was the day someone stole them from me on Amtrak while I was asleep.
1,Tinny,"I would also give this product a 0 if I could. The sound is awful. It is all treble. I am not preoccupied with bass, but when the sound is this tinny, it is a complete waste of money. I even turned up the bass on the EQ all the way and there was absolutely no change. These earphones could be the single worst pair of earphones I have ever used. I also do not think they are that comfortable but that is hardly a consideration when your favorite song sounds this bad. Do not buy."
4,GOOD VERY,Very good for the price. They fit well and sound food. The design is very comfortable to me. I am NOT an audiophile but I say they sound very good. MY ear refuses to discern. The thing is I wish Sony would drop their asymmetrical cord Y length or at least get the relative lengths more realistic. To me one side is too short the other too long. Hack half out of the long side and splice it on the short end would be about right. I would say the sound quality is more than worth the price of these.
2,Disappointing,"I bought these hoping for a good replacement to my Sony MDR-J10 headphones which, by the way, stopped working in the left ear. I am now convinced of Sony's poor wiring on their lower priced headphones. The first thing I noticed was the low sound volume on the MDR-EX81LP. My old Sony MDR-J10 had louder sound. Another thing that bothered me was the annoying wiring around the headphones. Why didn't they just make the lengths even, like regular headphones? And finally, the headphones have low durability. They broke where the ear buds meet the metallic part. Very flimsy.On the plus side, the several size options for the rubber ear buds is good. The small size ear buds fit perfectly in my ears. Now I'm left trying to decide whether to by an MDR-J10 again, or to go for really high priced headphones. I might as well buy high priced headphones, because I will end up paying the same if I keep on buying replacement cheaper headphones."
1,"snug fit, what's that?","The whole point of buying a wrap around headphone is so that you can get a snug fit while conducting rigorous activities. These do not provide a snug fit and are a failure by design. Admittedly, they do look cool, however, if you are going to be using these for the gym and or running they will not remain secure, in turn defeating the purpose of buying this style of headphone."
2,Not fond,"I am not fond of these. They don't sound appreciably better than the standard I-Pod buds, the cord is awkward, and the post that connects the sound piece to the piece that wraps around your ears doesn't seem to adjust so they don't fit snugly on my ears. Basically I bought these but still use my white i-pod buds."
4,Sony Quality,"I had purchased same set of Sony headphones two years ago. They provide an excellent audio and they have very comfortable fit for active people (jogers, walkers, etc.) The onlyissue I had that the wires near the ear connection started to break away. Neverless I decided to purchase the same set for replacement.Sony MDR-EX81LP Bud-Style Stereo Earphones (Black)"
2,Sub-par performance. Recommend looking elsewhere.,"I mainly purchased these earphones because I love the sound and bass you get from earphones while also being close-constructed means hearing less noise around you. But when I saw that Sony had developed earbuds that would stay behind your ear to prevent them from falling I out, I thought that would be a great idea. However, the product is very flawed. The plastic that is supposed to stay behind your ears is way too oversized, and there is no way to adjust it. Now, instead of keeping the buds in securely, the added weight of the the plastic tends to pull the buds out when exercising or even moving about. The sound is okay, but I would actually recommend the other Sony earphones, (the link to the right) as the sound is just as good, they are much more affordable and they feel a lot more secure.Sony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia Headphones"
2,"Excellent Sound, Painful Electric Shocks","These earphones provide excellent sound for the money. Rich bass, sharp treble and tight sound isolation with the comfortable and adjustable rubber earpieces.However I experienced painful electric shocks in both ears if I put pressure on my eardrums, such as getting up from a chair. And that was before I stood in the puddle of water. Just kididng. Shocks occured in first and Sony-provided replacement pair. They eventually replaced with an on-the-ear model.I have no problems with other Sony headphones or earphones, I think the speaker membrane was positioned too close to my eardrums. Since there are on other comments about this issue, I'll assume its isolated, but beware of shocks on perhaps a smaller scale."
5,Sony earbuds,These headphones are a great buy. Excellent bass response and the clarity is amazing. These sound as good if not better than the other high end high priced manufacturers out there.
2,Great earphones - EXCEPT,"I love the sound of these and they isolate external noise very well. I ride the bus and with this in and some music at even low volume settings it completely drowns out all the chatter and other bus noises. The over the ear part of it does not fit very well... only thing that part has come in handy is when I temporarily remove one to talk to someone it keeps it on ear. Now the bad part and from reading through multiple reviews this seems to be a common flaw. The sheathing around the wire deteriorates. I have only owned for only a couple months and there are a lot of bare wires exposed. I am disappointed in Sony's use of substandard materials. I expect better from them, especially since I paid $50 for mine and even at 30 that is disappointing (they should be more durable)."
1,ear phones,"these ear bugs have a rigid piece that has to fit over your ear vs just placing in the ear canal and letting them hang. I bought 2 pair , threw one pair away and returned the other. Could not get the rigid piece to fit over the ear and still get the speaker piece to stay in my ear. just didn't work for me !"
2,You must have the perfect ear shape,"I bought these because my ear buds don't give me the optimum sound I want. I decided to puchase these from other reviews stating that the sound was great. The issues are the different sizes of ear buds that come with it don't work in my ear. The Big and Medium ear buds don't fit in my ear and if they are not perfectly situated in your ear you will not get the full effect of the sound quality, which is great, but the smaller ear buds fit in my ear and get really good quality sound, the only problem is they become dislodged from my ear and I have to constantly adjust them back into my ear. Very annoying. I wanted to use they when I run, but that can't happen since they keep coming out of my ear. Plus when they are in there you can hear yourself swollow and breath, which is discomforting. All in all their fine if you are just laying there, but not for active use."
4,Sony Earbuds,"I like these earbuds very much. The sound is very sharp and strong, and the ear buds themself are comfortable and stay in place. As a matter of fact, they stay in place so well that the ""behind-the-ear"" wrap around feature may not be needed at all.Well worth the small price in every category. Highly recommended at this level of quality."
1,Horrible,Don't buy these. The treble will blow your ear drums out. No bass to speak of. I'm out $40. Everyone looking for a good set should keep on looking. The ear-buds that came with the I-Pod sound better.
4,"OK for the $, but cord wears out","Pros:-Very good sound-Stay on your ears - won't fall off even when running or working out-Very comfortable (at least for me)Cons:-As others have commented, the cord for the earphones wear out. This is my 3rd pair in about 2 years, and I use electrical tape once the wire is actually exposed. I would possibly upgrade to Etymotic or Shure, but I'd be afraid that the same thing would happen at two to three times the cost."
2,Disappointment,"I received these as a gift (I had specifically asked for them). The sound and overall quality are good but the unequal length of the cords running from where the wire splits and goes to the ear buds really bugs me. I like to have the wires go behind my neck and inside my shirt when I work out. Because of the unequal lengths, the left side with the shorter wire constantly is being pulled and is uncomfortable. Why don't they make the wires equal length?"
1,Bought 2 pairs and both broke,I purchased one pair which lasted a few months before one speaker stopped working. Since they felt great and stayed in my ears I purchased a replacement set. They to experienced the same problem after a few months. I will not be going for a third. I've learned my lesson. I believe the problem to be the wires that run into each ear piece is not secured very well.Try something different. Sorry!
1,Not for everyone...,"I've bought these earphones for my Ipod, but was very disappointed with the way they fit. They actually didn't fit me at all. The big loop that goes above my ear, would just hang there without even touching my ear. I was hoping that I could go running with them, and they would be much better than the regular earphones, since these supposedly would stay on my ears without falling out and release the pressure off of my ear canal by hanging over my ears, but that wasn't the case. I wouldn't say that I have small ears, but these are definitely not for every user.Other than that, they seem to be of a very high quality and sound pretty good. I wish they were adjustable!"
3,"Great Sound, Poor Fit",While these headphones have great quality sound for the price it has been a real struggle trying to keep them in my ears. The headphones came with three different size rubber ear pieces but regardless of which set I try they keep slipping out with even a little head movement or even none at all. These are the only pair of in-ear style headphones I have owned and I don't think I would purchase this style again.
4,Sony MDR-EX81LP decent phones for the price,Although slightly weak in the bass compared to some these are good sounding earbuds for the price. I use them primarily at the gym hence the desire for the behind the ear loop. This style does a good job of keeping them secure without any noticable discomfort.
2,Don't Lose The Rubber Ear Pieces!,"I am not an audiophile, but I thought that these earbuds performed well. Where they fall behind is that the removable rubber ear buds easily fall off. There are three sizes that come with the earbuds, but generally only one set fit well. I called Sony and asked for another set.... $15!!! This is my second and last pair (once again the rubber ear buds have fallen off and are no where to be found). Not worth the price if you ask me."
4,real nice for $30,"i thought these earbuds were pretty darn good. much better fit than the ipod buds, which constantly popped out of my ears (i have small ear openings) and i like that these hook over the top and they fit in and stay in. you DO have to make sure they are pushed in with a snug fit in order to pick up the bass, but i found them to be very clear, good bass (not boomy or tinney) and all around i was very impressed for $30. i've only had them 1 month, so i'll have to see about wear and tear and break downs....tho i'm not hard on my electronics and music equipment.... i take very good care of my 'stuff'."
3,Nice buds but be careful,These have good sound and are comfortable. They come with 3 sizes of ear buds which snap on. This is good because it allows for a more customized fit. The downside is they can pop off and you can lose them. They are very expensive to replace.
2,The cord problem is real.,"The sound quality of these earphones is really good. I was very pleased with my purchase until about 4 months (1 month past warranty) into them, when I noticed bare wire on the cord in two places. The cord is very cheaply made and doesn't seem to stand up to the normal wear and tear. I love the sound quality, but the cord problem can present a serious problem."
2,"BEWARE! May not fit, and you will not be able to return them for full credit.","I bought a pair, which I expected to be similar to the MDR-EX71SL phones (which I seem to have lost), except more securely fit to the ear. In fact, they DID NOT fit my ear (they fall off, because the metal shaft is too long), and when I inquired about returning them, Amaz*n tells me I am only eligible for a 50% refund because I opened them.The sound is pretty good (which is why they got a couple stars, even though they're useless to me), but they simply won't stay in, and I'll probably have to put them on *bay or something.Incidentally, I wear those ""crappy Koss spark plugs"" someone else referred to at the gym...the sound isn't the ultimate, and maybe the other guy didn't like them, but they stay in my ears!"
5,I liked them,"I am not a music expert so I cannot rate the speaker quality, base, ect. The sound seems great to me. I bought the headphones to use when I excercise. I really like them. They are very comfortable, they stay on even when I am running, and they don't hurt my ears."
4,"I love them, with reservations","These earphones are a great product. They are very nearly the equal of similar products twice their price. But they aren't perfect. My issue isn't with the phones themselves, but with their earpieces. I have small ear canals for a man, and the medium size earpieces are just a bit too big, while the small earpieces are too small. Instead of just 3 sizes of earpieces Sony needs to supply 5 of them. This is especially so since this kind of earphones require a good seal to get full sound quality. I'm in the process of hunting better earpieces for them and I expect I may need custom earmolds. But then, if you really expect to get the most out of this style of earphones then a custom earmold is really a requirement."
4,it is a good earphone,"it is a good earphone. however, just like many other sony's earbud products ie: ex 71, ex 51.. the wire wore off quite easily. i have this product for 3 month, and the rubber coating material has wore off in some parts and left in side wire expose outside.it does an excellent job with ipod. (ipod lacks bass), it also does an excellent job to isolate outside noise. however, the hook shaped earbud can eaily hook up to other objects such as your clothes, wires ect.nevertheless, it is a good buy, for 29 dollar, i would definitely get another one if this one fails."
2,"Good sound, bat fit.","Hook doesn't fit my ear, and unless it's an exact fit, it won't fit anyone's ear. Fortunately, stays pretty well in place without the hook over my ear, but it <looks> silly. Why doesn't Sony offer one without this ridiculous hook?"
1,Very poor fit,"I wasted my money on these earphones because they won't stay in my ears even when I lie still - which is what I bought them for. I like to lie down and listen to a CD when I go to sleep, and regular headphones are bulky and uncomfortable. These would never work for any kind of exercise."
2,Don't do it,"I bought these looking for a more comfortable and better-sounding replacement for the buds that came with my ipod shuffle. These are neither more comfortable nor better sounding. In fact, to get any bass or richness of sound, I have to shove them so far into my ear canal that they are soon less comfortable than the ipod buds. I'm going to buy some over-the ear phones instead of trying again with shure or some very expensive in-ear model."
2,BEWARE!,"I bought these from this site about six months ago. There were mixed reviews but I felt pretty confident about them. I don't know what the people who posted positive reviews were thinking! Since I have rather large ears I was sure they would not be too large-not the case. These things are HUGE. They fall off all the time. The sound is ok, I have to give them that. But the guy that complained that one cord was longer than the other was on point. When you have one bud that has a six inch chord and one bud that has a twelve inch chord they pull out easily and often. Please save your money on this one."
2,disappointment,"Very difficult to keep in ears. It doesn't really matter what I'm doing with them (e.g. working out/sitting in place listening). The lining around the ear seems just for show as it provides no security whatsoever. The sound is exceptional, however, if you can manage to keep the buds in."
3,1 side only...,"As a runner, I tried numerous headphones and these seem to be the best overall. They're very secure and sound fantastic. It's been 7 months and now only one side works. It most likely due to all the perspiration while running but be aware this item only has a 90 day warranty. They do offer an exchange program for $29 but why get it refurbished when Amazon offers it new for a little over $30 bucks.Simply put, don't purchase this if you plan on exercising..."
3,"Good sound quality, poor durability","This earphone sounds excellent, it is also very delicate too. You will need to buy another one within a year. Wire so easy to get tangled, worn, torn. SONY needs to pay more attention to quality."
5,"Great headphones, good value","If you like the clip-on h.ear headphones, but the soundquality and feel of the Fontopia, these are your headphones. They are extremely comfortable, effectivly weightless, and sound great. They are well worth the money. I am very pleased with the purchase."
2,Breaks to easy,"The headphones sound incredible and block out noise very well, however, they have the wrap around the ear feature which makes it very easy for them to break (the wire gets pulled out of the hard rubber). I had mine for four months and one side broke and Sony won't repair them. That's not what I expected out of a $30 pair of headsets. If your going to, buy the ones that aren't wrap around because they last a lot longer."
2,"Great sound, poor wire quality","I've had these headphones for little less than one year, so I suppose I'm able to write a review based on long term use.The soundquality is excellent and especially bass-lovers (when you took out some time finding the proper fit) will appreciate the bass response.However, for this kind of price I think one can expect a decent thicker and more isolated wire because here the build quality is very poor.Earphones are products for on the move, but especially in this department the product fails on durability. There is no decent dedicated carrying case supplied, so wrapping the wire around the MP3-player will be the most used solution: it will kill the thin wire in no time.Overprized."
2,Fell apart after 4 months,"I wore these running/cycling and apparently sweat breaks down the glue in the earpiece. The left earbud fell off after 4 months of use.The sound quality is good, but I would not recommend for somebody who is going to use them while working out."
1,Poor Design,"I had great expectations for this product, earbuds that wouldn't fall out, but I had to return them. The design is faulty, the ear hangers are fixed and should have been made adjustable. When the earbuds are in the ear canal the ear hangers do not rest on the top of the ear and when you position the hangers on your ear the earbuds won't stay in the ear canal. Several people tried them with the same result, in one case, with the earbud inserted in the ear canal, the ear hanger was almost one inch from the top of the ear.Earbuds (I've tried half a dozen different ones) seem to never stay snug and fall out with almost any activity. The sports-type ear hangers stay in position but can have low sound even with the ipod volume set to max.Now, I get the fit, volume and sound I wanted using inexpensiveSony MDR-J10 h.ear Headphones with Non-Slip Design (Black)coupled with theUpbeat Audio LLC R234-2 Boostaroo Revolution Amplifier for iPod (Black)."
3,Not really what I expected!,"Well, I was very excited from the looks and reading reviews abt. this product. It displayed a great fitting over your ear, besides the name of SONY.But, sadly, these really aren't that great for me!Firstly, it doesnt fit over my ear perfectly and while I work at the gym the left ear plug seems to fall out. Have to adjust it manually, every time it falls. The sound quality isn't that impressive either.Overall, if u want decent earphones and ready to spend $25-30 these aren't really bad."
2,Damn!,"I was so hoping that these little beauties would be the answer to my prayers of a great sounding earbud that wouldn't fall out of my ears on the slightest tug. I have been purchasing this Sony line for 8 years and consistently find the sound quality to be superior to anything in its price range. The only problem was their tendency to become dislodged when very sweaty or if they got slightly entangled with my clothes. I had read that you needed to have the perfectly sized ears for these to be effective, and my wife has always told me mine are very cute, but, alas, it isn't enough. Although they sound great as usual, the configuration seemed too big to secure them around the back of my ear.I returned them for an even earlier model than the 71/81 SL series because I wanted a shorter one piece cord. The 51's are awesome.Thanks for trying Sony. Maybe next time."
4,Good,"After my ipod earphones broke, I immediately went to best buy to purchase new ones. When I first bought these and listened with them, I was annoyed. I felt like the sound quality wasn't as good as the ones that came with my ipod, but after a few days of listening, I realized the quality wasn't worse, just different. What I really don't like is the rubbery chord!"
2,Not as good as hoped,"I bought th ese for my son. His comments were:""They don't stay in my ears""""They don't sound as good as the cheaper SONY earphones I have"""
1,This bud's not for me.,"The sound quality of these earphones is decent, but not top quality - they are lacking bass ranges. Unfortunately, the earpieces are one size only and they were too large to fit my ears, so they do not make for a good exercise/running companion. Overall: disappointing."
1,Worst earphones ever.,Sony's MDR-EX81LP earphones are the worst. It will not stay on my ears and the sound quality is the worst.
4,Good stuff,"The only issue I have with these. They don't like to stay in my ears all the time, but the are overall very good stuff"
3,Fit for Purpose Earphones,"The package I received appeared second hand not new. So, my first impression was not immediately positive. My first thought was to return them to Amazon. The carrying case is very cheap.Sound quality for my taste is not that great compared to Apple's sold for about the same price from Amazon. But Apple's earphones always needed adjustment during my jog.I would not pay the retail price of about $50 for this Sony product charged by major electronic stores.The reason for three stars is because so far these earphones stay put while jogging. And the sound is okay. So it is basically fit for purpose in my case. Otherwise, my rating would be lower.I don't get the reason for Sony using such a long wire and uneven extensions for these earphones. It gets in the way.I plan to get my wear and tear money from this purchase, but I probably choose something else next time."
3,"Good bass, poor sound isolating buds","Please bare in mind I am comparing these to my only other set of noise-cancelling ear buds, the Etymotic 3i set.The sound quality of these ear buds is excellent for the price, and the bass quality is actually better than the more-expensive Etymotics. HOWEVER, the ear buds simply don't fit in the ear canal as well, leading to much higher levels of environmental noise entering the ear.Worth the low price, but not great for louder environments."
3,Good sound/poor design,"I usually don't get earbuds because they never stay in my ears but I thought the clip would help but was I wrong. Also due to the wire design, with the wire splitting from the left earbud leaving the right one longer, not only does it look silly because one side is longer but it also puts strain on the left side causing it to fall out of my ear quite often.If you don't have weird ears like mine you should be ok because after burning them in the sound was pretty decent."
3,Not good for sensitive ears,"The Bud-Stype earphones go deep into the ears and tightly block it. This is uncomfortable and my ears feels stuffy after a while. Afterall, I developed an infection and have to stop using it."
2,Returned them because they didn't fit in my ears.,I had to return these because even the smallest ear pieces did not fit in my ears. I'm a guy and I've never had trouble wearing earplugs so I was surprised that I could not get these to sit in my ear canals.
3,Not as good as EX70s,"I bought a pair of these to improve my iPod, but to my ears the sound quality os not as good as for my old pair of EX70s. the bass is quieter and the trebles are louder and thinner. the midrange is good. Overall they don't seem as solid as the EX70s, and in the end now I never use them."
1,Total Disappointment!,"I am a loyal Sony products owner and generally find their products to be superb. I bought the subject earphones specifically to use when working out with the assumption of typical satisfaction with the product. I was thoroughly disappointed. Perhaps if I were Dr Spock these things would fit my ears, but I am not, and they don't. The earpiece is flimsy and not adjustable, as a result the top is 3/8 of an inch over the top of my ear, making the device useless. My first reaction was to toss them in the wastebasket, but then decided to leave them in the cafeteria at my work. Perhaps Spock will beam by, see them there and be able to use them."
3,Diamonds are forever,"The different phases of carbon, such as graphite and diamond, with their unique and often contrasting properties, has continuously intrigued scientists and engineers throughout the last century. This fascination and interest is often manifested in the form of conferences dedicated to the element. This book is the proceedings from one such conference that took place in 1995. The text itself is quite easy to read, as its focus is on mechanical properties; hence little mention of quantum mechanics and band structure. I read through it to glean for useful data and references for my Ph.D. thesis."
1,Not lead-free,"Despite what other reviewers say, this hose is not safe to drink from. It states right on the back side of the packaging, ""Note: The brass in this product contains lead."" Of course, you can't see that warning until you buy it. If you live outside of California, your state may not even require such a warning. Also, the female brass end that connects to the hose bib is very cheaply made. The plastic hose itself is simply pushed onto the brass connector. That's it. There's nothing but a tight fit holding it on. Mine leaked as soon as I connected it. I thought it was the washer that was bad but when I looked closely, it was leaking from the brass part that's pushed into the hose. Worthless hose."
5,great hose!,"perfect for our rv, connecting with 25ft to make total 100ft water hose- great price, best i could find online and instore! quick s/h- thanks!"
3,Leaks & seems flimsy but safe for drinking!,"It has a rubber type collar around where you attach the hose to the spicket. It is hard to get it on tightly and leaks. It also kinks very easily. I like the Teknor Never Kink hose better (which I bought one of each), but it is safe for all my animals to drink from and that makes it worth it. I don't leave the water on as this does ""bulge"", doesn't seem very strong for lines with a lot of water pressure. It has a 10 year warranty so I will give this hose a chance, we'll see."
1,Not recommended,"I have been teaching with this book for 2 years and the more familiar I am with it the less I like it and the more mistakes I find on it. It was not chosen by me and I hope we'll change it soon. The textbook and workbook have plenty of mistakes even though it is a second edition.This book claims to cover cultural elements from most Spanish speaking countries but it only sets each chapter in a different country, with very little cultural information about each place. The ""encuentro cultural"" section is the only cultural information in the book (apart from the video section) and most times is inaccurate or just plain boring or not interesting at all. Another problem is that many of the communication exercises are not communicative at all and not very involving for the students. Finally, I think that a book which costs more than $100 should, at least, have more pictures and color pages and it should try to make learning a language a more rewarding and fun experience."
2,Poor product,"I needed a copy of ""Plazas"" 2nd edition for my Spanish class. At the time the only binding, available on Amazon, was the ""Live Edition"", so I bought it. Well, it turns out that the book is different (while similar) to my classmates' regular edition. Moreover, the additional materials and exercises require registration on the publisher's website. Long story short, I couldn't get through their registration process. By the way, I develop e-commerce solutions for a living, but their system of ""book keys"" and ""passwords"" required to get access to the online content was just beyond me. I can't possibly recommend this book. Stick with the regular edition, and you'll be fine."
2,PLAZAS: LUGAR de encuentros - w/audio cd's,"I ordered this book through Best Books. I was suppose to receive theaudio cd's with the book, but when I received the book the cd's were notinside the book. I informed Best Books of this situation and was told thatthe cd's were missing. Be sure that you read all details before ordering."
2,Thanks a lot !! It's awesome!,"I wanted this item so much but the deal wasn't done. I never got the item but thanks to the good communication from the seller.Edit: The sellers are so awesome, they shipped the item again. It's in a great condition and I wish I could change the rating to 5 stars!Thanks for the great service!!"
4,Quality sound with the SA1000...but a few concerns,"A good set of headphones from Sony.The ProsThis product has a full sound spectrum with realistic reproduction of classical music.The headphones cushions rest on the head instead of the ears, making the unit reasonably comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.The ConsThe price; In Canada $299.00 from the Sony storeThe unit, although not heavy, is big and clunky and because of its size tends to be moved around a bit by pillows or cushions when used while lying down on a sofa.All in all a quality sound product but pricey and somewhat cumbersome. 3 1/2 stars."
2,"Decent, but...","I agree with everyone else with the comfort of the headphones and the sound quality...but only one problem. If you plan to use these for gaming or casual music listening, I recommend you get something else, perhaps some a bit more sturdy like the VJ700s. The only thing that connects the headphones to the earpieces is a plastic piece which covers just a bit under half a centimeter of surface area. In other words, the only thing that that connects the ear pieces together is a piece of plastic that is about the cross-sectional area of a pencil. Unfortunately, I had these since July and they broke in the beginning of December of the same year.I contacted Sony and because I did not shell out a lot of $$, I was not able to get it repaired unless I paid 60 some dollars...Overall, stay away. These babies won't last you very long."
2,Not perfect for anybody,"I don't know exactly who these were designed for. I'm a DJ, and tried using them for both spinning & home use. I found:Positives:* Great sound quality* Can take a lot of amplification and bass without distortion* Block outside noise wellNegatives:* They're really comfortable with both earphones on, but hard to wear on only one ear! They're just not built for it!* They are HUGE and feel like they are going to break. They earcups are connected by a very small joint. I was too nevous to actually take them to a gig.* So, I thought, fine, maybe I'll just use them at home & work and get another set for gigs - but no. These headphones project sound outwards. To people in the room, it sounds like you are listening to laptop speakers.So, unless you're a studio dj who works alone, I'd go with the 700's"
4,Way Too Much Cord,"I am very happy with the sound, appearance, and fit of these headphones. The only drawback (which may cause me to return them) is that the cord is way too long - like six feet or so. I use headphones primarily for my iPod, so this leaves a ton of cord to gather up and stuff in my pocket or something. I wish the primary cord was shorter, with an extension provided; it's hardwired in, and can't be replaced.If you want a long cord, these are exceptional. If I used them for a different purpose (like DJing or watching movies) I would give a five-star rating."
1,Poor sound or bad luck?,"I just received the Sony MDr-SA1000 and bought it directly from Amazon. I don't know if I received a fake or what but my headphones' box appeared scratched on the outside which made me question whether it was new, like the vendor claimed. Despite this, the headphone itself seemed new/mint condition.Comparing my previous experience with the Sony MDR-V700DJ, the MDR-SA1000 seems utterly lacking in the bass department. Even when I adjust my equalizer for my songs this headphone reaches nowhere near the volume and fullness of the Sony MDR-V700DJ. The bass gets completely distorted when I try to adjust the sound. The volume level it is able to reach is worse than some $30 headphones I've had. There is way too much treble in this model but what's annoying is that even with sound adjustments, this problem can't be overcome. Considering how much this headphone cost, I am totally disappointed and will buy the Sony MDR-V700DJ from a trusted vendor.Beware buyers!!!!"
3,Pretty good story ... nice to see a young Marlon,I had never heard of this and decided to take a chance. It was pretty good. Nice to see Marlon with light hair - he looked good like in The Young Lions.
4,Marlon's Marvelous Mood Movie,"""The Night of the Following Day"" marked something of a resurgence in Brando's then sagging career. I knew director Hubert Cornfield who told me that Brando didn't take directions, he gave them. In this case his instincts were right on. He and his fellow cast members deliver first-class ensemble acting performances. Particularly memorable is the deliciously evil Richard Boone. Marvelously eerie mood photography of the foggy French seashore adds much to the suspenceful atmosphere. Unfortunately what might have been a masterpiece is marred by a cliche ""twist"" ending that leaves the viewer terribly disappointed in view of what has gone on before. This is one time when an alternate ending might have saved the movie."
4,"Brando, Boone make sordid tale interesting","The Night of the Following Day is the story of four criminals who kidnap a rich girl(Pamela Franklin) upon her return to Paris. They take her to a beach house where she is held for ransom.Her captors include a washed up petty crook(Jess Hahn),his drug addicted sister(Rita Moreno), her boyfriend(Marlon Brando) and a sadist(Richard Boone). The film is very interesting, yet disturbing to watch at times due to the nature of the film. Watching Brando is fun. Its easy to see why he is one of the greatest actors of alltime. Boone is frightening as Leer, a big, unpleasent, wacko who is out for the double cross.I would highly recommend this film, but one should be warned that it is preety rough in spots and unsettling.Brando and Boone dominate the film."
4,Brando and Boone lunge off the screen in taut thriller,"Yes, it is Brando -- lean as in Kowalski lean, sexy, fierce, winning and anti-heroic (our more than substantial reply to France's Belmondo); and Boone, the nastiest of heaviest -- snarly, bullying, craggy and thoroughly killable -- the film itself has a tightness one associates with John Frankenheimer -- splendidly un- to half-likeable characters (done to turn by Rita Moreno and Pamela Franklin, among others) and a script that bites; but it is Brando who holds us -- at his best he wasn't a contender . . . he was champ; get this film."
5,Retrieving a treasure,"My purchase was a repeat performance, since I bought ""Ages of Man"" when it was issued as an LP decades ago. I don't know of any actor better than Gielgud when he reads verse. He belongs in the record library of anyone in love with poetry and with Shakespeare."
2,Not Good,Only the first track is good with a little bit of vocalsThe 3rd one is a strange mis of it with alot of drums and very long so i didnt like it.........the 2nd track is just okayBut.......the first one is kinda good so u can try u'r luck with it!!
2,Not the USA version however.,"I was hoping that this was the Big Brother TV theme for an internal video we were to shoot. Sadly, this is a dance club sound that is the UK version of Big Brother, and has nothing to do with the USA version. Don't bother if you are looking for the USA theme song."
1,Return of the Fly Paper!,"I won't buy this product again, I'll drop an extra $7.00 and buy 3M brand instead.I ordered grits 120 thru 320, as far as sanding goes it does that. The main problem with this product was that the adhesive stuck to my wooden sanding blocks and was a pain in the butt to remove; as it delaminated leaving layers of the sticky backing and paper to be removed for several frustrating minutes each time I changed paper. I've used 3M products and this has never a problem.Also, the 320 had gunky black marks on the sanding face ... anyone in quality control over there?"
4,stick on PSA sandpaper,"Great product. Shame abut the delay in shipping, despite having paid for2 day service, product did not arrive for a week!"
1,poor quality tapes,"I bought this set new, and at least two tapes will not play. I have contacted Pimsleur customer service five times about replacements (as they instruct you to do on their website) and have been ignored every time.A product is worthless if you can't use it."
5,Christian's read this book,Read this book for your true history and heritage. Read Galatians 3:28-29 and learn the truth. This is not new information this is old lost information. Read the Scottish declaration of independence as they say they crossed the red sea with Moses. I have an earned masters degree in the Bible and a student of history. This is the real deal.
4,"Well-fitting, Light Weight Helmet","This helmet is great for riding in hot climates! It is well-ventilated and very light-weight. Although the Large was a bit snug with the original thick pad, it comes with additional thinner pads, so it is easy to adjust the fit. The blue color looks a bit brighter online, but it is actually a checked blue/black pattern on the helmet. Other than that, I am very happy with it and recommend it to others looking for a comfortable & attractive helmet."
2,Very disappointed!,"I recently purchased a Shermag glider, and I was really disappointed with the quality. The moving parts were all painted over, and I hoped this was a one time mess up and ordered another, and then another. When the chair ""glides"" it makes crackling noises as the paint chips off. After three Shermag gliders with the same problems I think we have serious manufacturing problems. Hubby and I have spent HOURS trying to scrape the paint off the metal parts, but unfortunately we cannot get to the paint out of the small crevices. I hope that with time the sounds will get less because my contact with Shermag has not yielded any response yet. In addition, one of the three chairs had a broken chair back. I would not buy this again.[...][...][...]-Sarah"
3,Comfortable but not the best manufacturing,"This chair is pretty comfortable to sit in and not too difficult to put together. However, within a year of use, two of the springs had popped out. I used crazy glue to secure them back in, but one of them keeps popping out anyway."
2,don't buy this chair!!!!,It looks pretty in the picture but when my husband went to set it up all of the holes were so close together......the arms curve in and I can't even sit in the chair! we are having to drill new holes to adjust the problem. Its a pretty chair but the seat could only fit a toddler (and I don't know any pregnant or nursing mothers with that waist line).
4,Who Knew?,"Who knew that squid and mackerel came from such funny looking contraptions?We purchased this entire fishing set for our culinary school to show our chefs exactly where the fish they're preparing comes from. I looked around and could not find anything so specific in exploring the different fisheries as this one.Weir Fishing, part 3 of the series, is my personal favorite, tying with the shellfishing documentary. My only reservation here is that we would have preferred DVD but the VHS worked for us too!"
5,staple,this book is one for your library. i used in my management class and i still refer back to after graduation.
5,Excelent book by excelent authors,The book is very comprehensive and uses very good learning methodology. One can find all that is important in the area of management control. I can highly recomend the book to anyone interested in this field looking for a methodological guide to management control.
2,I sent this back.,"This looks to be a well written and researched book. However, when I purchase art books I want loads of illustrations. I want to be able to refer to the artwork with out having to pop in a dvd. This book contains NO ARTWORK. Hayao Miyazaki is an amazing artist and director. I would love to own a book on his work. This just wasn't what I had dreamed of."
3,A good book badly mistitled,"This is a good scholarly analysis of Miyazaki. Interesting in its own right, but not what I was expecting.The book is handicapped by a badly ambiguous title! I, too, expected to find plentiful illustrations in a book with this title. I should have read the reviews first.Four stars for actual content; two stars for no pictures at all!"
3,The anime art of Hayao Miyazaki,"Item came in time alright (earlier as predicted).But my expectations were other than what the item showed me on Amazon.The book is pure text and I expected really pictures, documenting Miyazaki's art, or what the author is talking about.It's weird reviewing Miyazaki's art without seeing what the author is talking about. To me this book seems more like an end of terms art school work or a thesis the author made for college, maybe even a PhD work?All in all I was a bit disappointed for the reasons mentioned above, also referring to the price, which wasn't really cheap."
4,The man behind the cartoon curtain,"This is a great book about both Miyazaki and his work. Each movie is dicussed in detail, with critiques and essays about the animation, themes, writing, and designs of every movie that Hayao Miyazaki created.Also covered in this book is the creation and growth of Studio Ghibli. How it started as a small animation studio up to the current success that it is today."
4,Well-written and interesting,"This was a very interesting account of the German-Jewish experience in the United States from the mid 19th century through the mid 20th century. It looks carefully at how a number of families rose stratospherically into the nation's financial elite within a short period of time. While the families were assimilated on some levels (particularly with respect to economic achievement), they clung to their German roots on other levels (as demonstrated by their American-born children being schooled in the German tradition, and by certain political views). Many members of this group saw themselves as being German before being Jewish, and this set up an intra-religious ""pecking order"" (a member of this group marrying a non-German Jew was apparently out of the question). I only wish that the book would be updated, as it ends in the late 1950s."
3,The book has too much in it about motor oil,"This is an excellent book -- no doubt about it. Mr. Birmingham is in command of his facts. But there are just too many asides in here about shocks, struts and motor oil. Car lovers can read many other books -- this one should have stuck to the subject of Jews in America. But overall, it's a good book"
5,Lo mejor que ella ha hecho hasta hoy,"Excelente disco! Edith se animó por fin a grabar pop total bajo la producción de un compositor y productor de primera, Kike Santander. Su voz se escucha fresca y renovada, su música suena más latina que nunca y sus canciones van del dolor a la seducción. ""Donde va el amor"", ""Cuando grita la piel"", ""De nuevo tú"", y ""Quien vive en tu piel"" creo yo son las mejores de este disco aunque todos los temas son geniales sobretodo en la experimentada y bella voz de Edith. Definitivamente un disco que vale la pena escuchar y agregar a la colección de baladistas."
2,Plastic Microscope slides,"Blank Slides are what was expected however they are relative expensive when considering what they are made from and the difficulty of manufacture, and storage. 25 Prepared glass slides, specimen marked, and contained in a wooded storage box cost only 14.88."
5,As We Grow Older,I will be using this book as a guide for a class I am teaching at our community college this spring. It was very well presented and I look forward to the outcomes.
5,Seligmann's New Book,"Linda Seligmann gives us an intriguing ethnography of marketing in Cusco and Lima, and an account of life in contemporary Peru. Her generous use of interview materials and excerpts from her field notes bring the sights, sounds, and flavor of the market to life. Her work demonstrates skill, sensitivity, and wisdom. It is an excellent introduction to Andean studies for economic anthropologists, Latin Americanists, and general readers. It is also an positive answer to Néstor García Canclini's question, ""Can a foreigner study and understand another country?"": indeed, one can. This book demonstrates devoted study and understanding."
2,Heavy lining,"The description mentioned underlining in some areas, but the book had highlighting and underlining throughout."
4,Top notch live New York funk,"The original vinyl had a big impact on me as a musician. This is one of the best live representations of the great NYC funk unit of Steve Gadd, Eric Gale, Richard Tee, Marcus Miller, and Ralph McDonald that can be had. They show beautiful patience in serving the groove and not overplaying -- so often a challenge with electric jazz and funk. Masterful! Five great tunes and a couple of worthwhile extras."
1,"FAR FETCHED story, told a million times in the 80's","This is a generic, and far-fetched story, which is very similar to most other 80's films--Kids trying to save a community center, school, in this case a hotel from evil Real estate developers!!Why was this story told so many times in the 80's?""Breakin"", ""Beat Street"", etc.FAR FETCHED!!!The only saving grace of the film is some of the music--Phil Collin's ""We said hello goodbye"" is a classic, and Marisa Tomei is absolutely ADORABLE."
2,she's a cutie,"You know why you are considering this movie. So does Universal; look at the dvd cover. She wears bright lipstick; big, plastic jewelry; ridiculous clothes; cute bows and ribbons in her hair--all pink and 80s. All too cute. But she does not get much screen time. The main characters are three male friends. And other than Marisa, this movie is terrible."
3,Early Marisa Tomei feature,"I don't generally find movie actresses attractive; usually their phoniness shows through all too obviously...but wow, Marisa Tomei is adorable (don't tell my wife I said that). This is one of her (Marisa's, not my wife's) first big-screen appearances, in an otherwise fairly routine 80's teen comedy that ""stars"" people like Daniel Jordano and Michael Penn (Sean's brother, I believe).Any movie that relies on Harold Gould for respectability is probably in trouble. But it's fun and light-hearted, has a good soundtrack, and isn't mean-spirited, unlike so many other teen comedies. 103 minutes of big-hair 80's nostalgia! Rated PG-13."
2,Marketing tricks,"Well, it's always a pleasure watching Marisa Tomei and I'm not the only one who thinks so. So when you want to sell a DVD you put her on the cover of the box, without mentioning ofcourse that she has only a tiny supporting role in this movie, like 6 minutes of exposure. So I bought it, watched the movie and was very much dissappointed. This is a movie of below-average quality, only suitable for 16-year-olds that have an evening off and don't know what to do with themselves. Too bad....."
3,Playing for keeps,I ordered this movie for my grand daughter for christmas. I of course ordered the wrong one - but she keep it anyway.
2,Well....so much for modern video technology!!,"I waited for months and months for this to become available through Netflix, I received two days ago and I simply cannot over-emphasize how lousy it is. I had never seen bernie play before and I anticipated some incredible guitar playing. What I got was horrible sound and 1960's-ish video quality. It really is that bad. I could not get past the bad video, the bad sound,so I really cannot comment on whether the music is any good or are the songs worth listening to.I am guessing that these were recorded years ago, but since it is the only disc available that I am aware of showing Bernie play, I suggest his managers use some more recent footage, if it exists.You would never know this came oujt in 2005."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"After viewing a great TV commercial, my kids HAD TO GET THIS for their dad for father's day. They were very excited! Unfortunately, the first day was spent charging...cooling...cycling....cooling....charging...cooling the batteries. The next day our maiden run was VERY highly anticipated. The unit had VERY poor range randomly varying from 8-30 feet. The unit responded to radio-controlled commands just as randomly. Within HALF A MINUTE of our first run, the unit did not respond to turn commands within close range and ended up in a patch of grass, flipped, and the propellor broke. FROWN! Good concept, POOR PRODUCT. DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL TO ANYONE. I should mention, that my husband is an engineer, read the entire manual, and has much experience with radio-controlled products...therefore my point is that the problem was NOT operator-error."
1,Peice of junk!!,"DO NOT BUY!!! I ordered this airplane for my 17 year old son for his birthday. To start with it is never a good thing to see that the package includes super glue!! The thing was broken before we even got it out of the package!! We fixed the rudder (the part that was broken) and took it to the park for the test run. Guess what...it took a nose dive on the first run and cracked down the middle. The seller ""doesn't accept returns of damaged items"". So now we are stuck with a broken, uncontrollable, styrofoam peice of junk that the company won't stand behind. If you are looking to disappoint your child then buy this, if not...look elsewhere!!"
1,CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this from the NAVY Exchange online; didnt even come in any real packaging; looked like some guy found a box in his garage...Well anayway; it has just enough power to drive it into the ground... mine has probably a grand total of 46 seconds of flight time in about 8 tries; I'm not a skilled pilot but I doubt any more skill would help much.If you just want to use it as a boat that might work; I tried hand launching... maybe take off from water would work better? Sure would make landings softer... but then you have to swim out to get it because chances are it wont be upright.The elevator and turn flaps are 2 position only so you have to feather it to maintain control.
1,Do not buy,"This plane has horrible controls,First they are not proportional, when you turn left, its full left, up is full up, you cant turn ""just a little"", this makes controlling this plane a real big pain.It's very durable, no complaints in that department, but its a real bad in terms of controlling the plane.The worst part is that power is controlled by some sort of ""4 speed settings"" Slow -> medium -> fast -> fastest.Engine is not proportional this results in a very very very dificult flight, the plane will go up really fast or down really fast.It seems to be a cool RC, but fliying it is a real deception."
5,This is a cryptogram worker's dream - all cryptograms!,"I found this book to be error-free. It has page after page of puzzles to work on hour after hour. I recommend it for those who love cryptograms.For the novice, a clue is provided for each puzzle at the end of the book.I have had to buy several copies for family members who share my addiction to this clever type of puzzle.There are enough puzzles to last days and days and days. That beat working 20 in a puzzlebook, and then having to buy a new puzzlebook. I like all cryptograms. This book was written for me!"
3,A fun book but definitely NOT error free,"At this writing, I have worked 283 puzzles and have found three of them to have errors (puzzles 59, 256 and 272). While solving the puzzles has been fun, it's disconcerting to stumble across an error.It's still a fun book. Some of the puzzles almost solve themselves. Others require you to dig deep into your knowledge of spelling and syntax, as well as the personality of the author of the quotation itself. Most are somewhere in between. In fact, if you're a multitasker like me, you can watch TV or even talk on the phone while solving the puzzles.I'm beginning to panic at this point because I've only got 117 puzzles left! All in all, I recommend the book, errors notwithstanding."
4,charming simple story,"This tale about a kitten's misadventures delightfully brings one through the days of the week with simple text that preschool age children will quickly identify with. dePaoloa's pictures are an excellent match to the text. Those of us raised in a culture where the Genesis creation story is prevalent will quickly recognize the humor of Cookie's lack of a rest day.The only thing that disappointed me was the size of the book, believe it or not. It measures approximately 7 x 7 inches which makes it slightly smaller than I would wish for when reading to a large group of preschoolers. For snugglier situations such as a bedtime story this would not be an issue."
5,Cookie's week,cookie's week is a good book for kids under the age of 5 it will help them learn the names of the week and it will help intrest them in reading my little brother started to try to read it just aftr the 4th time of reading it to him and it was his favorit book for at least a year he also learned patterns in the book.
5,A Fascinating Book,"Very well documented and critical yet captivating like a detective novel, I strongly recommend this book. It's just a wonderful reader on archeological findings and research pertaining to the Old Testament. GKlein"
5,beautiful light,I had looked everywhere for this replacement shade. I had broken mine when I cleaned it was so happy to find this one. It makes a beautiful light.
4,"Wow! I see why this book sold 60,000 copies.","I'll make this short and sweet. Buy this book and read it; you'll be inspired to investigate the world of hydroponics. The author's enthusiasm comes across and makes one want to start experimenting before the book is finished. The full color pictures tell a story all their own. You can see what it's all about. I never considered that there were so many types of hydroponic methods. Dr. Sutherland extensively covers various plants and their needs. He recommends certain vegetables as his favorites and why. The big three mediums seem to be: perlite, vermiculite and ""growool"". If there was a negative to the book it would only be that the author is in Australia, so most of the appendix is directed toward Australian and New Zealand suppliers. Thanks to the internet I don't think that is such a big deal. If you haven't guessed it by now, I enjoyed this book."
3,not as good as expected,"Beautiful display but very disappointing because not sturdy as anticipated to be a Wilton product, wobbly, unlevel. easy to assemble"
2,Knob broken,"We ordered this roaster for Thanksgiving and discovered the knob was broken and we can't tell what temperature we have the roaster set at. Amazon has offered to send us a replacement but it is on back order for two months. We are still waiting for the replacement roaster oven. Disappointing because we would have liked to have used our roaster oven for Christmas too. Not this year, I guess."
2,18 Quart Roaster Oven,"The Roaster Oven I received was not the same as the item depicted in the picture. The model number is the same, but the one received seems to be an older out of date model. I wanted the one that was pictured with the Black Insert. The one I received has a Grey Insert. I could have purchased the one I received for less money on a different site.This seems to be an on-going problem when I make purchases from Amazon. They don't provide Customer Service numbers to call on the paperwork either. Very hard to talk to somebody on the phone."
4,Very cute lamb plush,"I bought this lamb for Easter for my 3-month-old niece. Who knows if she liked it, but it was very soft and cute. One of the reasons I got it was because the patch on its chest is pictured to say ""Lily,"" because that's my niece's name. When it arrived, the patch didn't say Lily. I wasn't that disappointed... it was really a small deal. Still a very cute, sweet lamb!"
4,Elvis-If everyday was like christmas,"Just wondered, is it me or do some of the songs sound like elvis is stoned. Like ""I'll be home for christmas"". I love anything Elvis and I'm not criticizing. I just want to know if anyone else hears it."
2,pure schlock,"I can guarantee that had he lived, the great Buddy Holly would not have become such a schlockmeister as this. I'm pretty sure that Gene Vincent would not have gone this route either.(While this is speculation on my part, I say this with confidence in Holly's musical genius, a genius when it came to recording and composing, resulting in music that basically surpasses Elvis's. I also say this with a belief that Gene Vincent was more of a cool rockabilly cat than was Elvis, who quickly left his rocker roots behind to become a lounge singer and B movie star. Elvis got the acclaim, but other 50s rockers were better.)In fact, in spite of being labeled ""the King"" of rock and roll, poor Elvis Presley was truly and ultimately a square, as hard as it is for his fans to admit it. This, his contribution to one of pop music's more irritating genres - i.e., Christmas albums - is proof. That's all I need to say about this."
1,little variety,"If you like alot of pictures of women's backs along the shoreline, you will like this book. I think there are better, more imaginative choices out there."
3,Cella or Not,"This album has it's strong points ""We Got It Hemmed"" one of the strong points. Yet it lacks on anything making it a classiic must have. It's average the rhymes have fravor but are watered down by there mono toned voices. If you want some old underground eastcoast frav buy it if your starting you collection now it should miss your playlist for a long time."
3,Nothing worth raving about,"This is an example of MC's who are confused. Some tracks come correct, others are just plain wack. I love most of the beats, that's why I even gave it a 3 star rating. The beats have some of that early to mid 90's jazz flavor, but man, some of the content in the rhymes are forgetable. F**king B**ches, get money, I heard the same things on more than one tracks. I don't know why, considering some of the singles they put out and also some of their collabs they've done, they've come correct. This, about a handfull of songs are good, the rest, at least the beats sound nice. Cop this if your a hardcore underground head and support the underground. If not, you may want to forget it."
3,"Good Sound, but does not fit to the ear!","Great sound, but the part that goes around your ear does not fit too good. Not worth the money!"
3,Bit Dissapoint due to 2 Major Area,"I didn't realize the add on plastic around the ear is so unconformtable to use it, take too much time just to put in on right. And the sound way to soft, bass is decepent, yes sound is pretty clean but not always depend which type of sound, and one of the lowest sound earphone i ever use, not recommand for common use, if u plan to use this while u workout or jagging maybe a good choice otherwhise is not."
1,Totally disappointed,"After reading reviews for these earbuds, I thought...here is the answer. Well they were not! They fall out of my ears which may be a blessing in disguise because the sound is underwhelming. They are very treble weak sounding earbuds with little full sound. I will keep looking."
3,Ok for the money but already falling apart,"These sound good for the money, but they are not great. The speaker wire is already frayed and broken from trying to adjust the length of the cord going to each earbud which apparently is not adjustable."
1,Disappointing,"Left earbud failed within 10 hours of use; buds would not stay inserted in my (admittedly small) ear canals, so they were worthless for exercising; sound not any better than basic buds anyway.Don't bother with these."
1,I returned the headphones.,"I was looking for a replacement for Apple iPod earbuds, and these were not it.The critical flaw was very poor bass. It was almost defective sounding. In the instruction it says something like ""If you don't hear high quality bass, place the headphones further in your ear."" ?!? That's a lawsuit waiting to happen. Even following the inane instructions, I couldn't get the bass much better.I returned the headphones."
1,TERRIBLE!!!,The headphone line is made from 1) a material that sticks together making them difficult to unravel and 2) a material that falls apart from twisting and otherwise.6 months old and I need to buy a new pair. Keep looking for another pair.
2,Dumbo would love these,"These sound great, but are too big for my ears. I'm an above-average sized adult male. I don't think I have small ears, and yet these do not stay on my ears because the loops are too tall. I honestly can't imagine these fitting more than 5% of human ears. Ridiculous."
2,Decent sound but poor design for small ears.,"I am no audiophile but I found the sound quality to be the same as my Sony MDR-EX71's and better than the stock iPod set. However, I bought these because I thought they would stay on and in my ears better when working out, running, and snowboarding. No such luck. The rubber ear cups work fine but the ear loop that is supposed to keep the earphones on my head are too big and are not adjustable so they just fall off like my other set. That is why I gave these a low score. Poor design ruined these for me."
3,Made for a giant,"I always have problems with earbud headphones staying in my ears. I thought these would be the perfect soultion. However I think these were made for a giant, as the over the ear piece does not fit snuggly around my ears. They hit almost a full 1/4"" above my ear. The buds themselves stay in my ear but then the friction and weight of the over the ear piece causes them to then fall out. Over all I would say the design is terrible and the sound is actually quite tinny. There really is no base audible at all. Not worth the money. I had better sound quality with the $9.99 Sony headphones I had previously."
3,"Okay, but not great","I tend to side with those reviewers who feel that the sound quality is not that great on these. You must shove the ear pieces deep inside the canal to get a good sound and if you run, like I do, they have a tendency to loosen up requiring they be pushed back in. That can be uncomfortable. My goal in getting these was for jogging and I find myself fidgeting with them. Interestingly, I had my son try them and he loved them, so I suspect there's a bit of ear structure and age at work here."
5,THE BEST *****,"Out of 3 other types of athletic headphones I've tired, these one are simply in a league of their own. I can wear them forever, and they feel great, whereas the others hurt my ears after 5-10 minutes, or don't even fit. These never fall out, they sound amazing.The only downside::After a year or two, of hard use, the rubber has ripped in two areas exposing the wires that run to the earbuds.The grey part that actually goes in your ear, can fall off about once a week, and is often hard to find, and they are impossible to find anywhere for sale.DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE YOU CAN BUY REPLACEMENT INNER-EAR CAPS??? OR WHATEVER THEY'RE CALLED? I'd love to stock up on them, so I don't have to bother spending 10 minutes searching the floor."
2,"Decent sound, horrible design","I'm a runner and was looking for a pair of earphones that would stay put during my workouts. While Sony took into account ear canal size (by providing different sized buds) they didn't put much thought into the piece that goes AROUND the ear. I'm a 5'10"" female with, what I consider, normal ears. The loops don't even come close to hooking around my ear. No amount of adjustment will make them work. A few minutes into my run and the earphones pop out. Since they do provide decent sound quality I've resorted to using them for plane rides and sedentary endeavors."
1,Mine didn't stay in the ears either,"I was looking for a nice in-ear headphone for the gym to listen to audio books and found these Sony Fontopia headphones with great reviews. I picked this MDR-EX81LP white over other Fontopia models due to its sport style. I'm a woman with normal ears but these headphones didn't stay in my ears even when I was sitting still. It was falling out all the time and very annoying especially when I was on the elliptical machine or lifting weights. So if your intention is to use at the gym or workout, I won't recommend."
3,iPod earbud repalcements?,Alas these earphones did not fit well around my spouse's external ear lobes so she gave up on them quickly and has gone back to her iPod earbuds. The stem and ear hooks are not adjustable for smaller ears although they come with three sizes of rubber ear canal inserts. I've tried them with iTunes on the computer and once they are wedged into the ear canals snugly the sound is good.
3,GREAT earphones *when it worked*,"These are fantastic earphones that give superb isolation and excellent overall audio sound. However, there's this one little tiny problem... the cord absolutely stinks! After about 6 months, the actual wires of the cord became exposed and then two months are that the left earphones just stopped working. By the way, this was a black ex81LP so this is *not* just an issue with the white color version.For all those reviews giving 5 stars to this product saying how there's no problem with the cord after 3 months -- I completely agree. My earphones were working fantastically after 3 months too... but unless you want to make it a ritual buying new earphones every 6-12 months... do yourself a favor and don't buy these earphones."
4,"Great, once you got it just right.","I got mines today and I thought it would it be the best headphones ever, considering the review on ilounge. At first, the audio was so-so, not really heavy on bass. I was planning to return them until I put on the apple ipod headphones again and realized it was a HUGE difference! The earhooks seemed to be a problem at the beginning. It stuck out and made me look like a Star Trek character. I looked at the diagrams on the package closer, and fidgeted with the headphones until I got it just right. It looks really good now, like regular headphones with earhooks. Not oversized at all like I read a lot on other reviews, and I'm only 11. I think if you spend some time trying on the different ear caps and try to fidget with it (rotating in your ear, etc.), you will be satisfied. Make sure by trying on your old headphones again before you make a judgement."
3,Satisfied...but....,"Great frequency range. Very comfortable to wear. Quality device.....expect for one important detail. For a benign device, the volume output is much lower than any other headphone or earbud device that I have experienced. I've compared this one with several others that I currently own and have determined that the problem exists in the earphones (not the player). It's a bit puzzling and I can't explain why this phenomenon exists. Be prepared for a volume let down."
3,"Great sound, Poor fit","I got these due the reviews for good sound quality, and good fit for those of us with smaller ears. The buds themselves with the small tips fit nicely, but the over the ear design is a joke. If I place the hooks over my ears, the buds hang down to my earlobe; if i put the buds in my ears, the hooks sit way above my ear and don't even touch the top of my ears. They then fall out/off with the slightest motion, especially since I wear glasses. I wish I had bought the ones without the ear hooks..."
1,Disappointing all the way around,"1) The over-the-ear hooks don't really fit over my ears -- they sort of balance on top of the ear. They are not adjustable. I'm an average-sized male, so it's hard to fathom this design.2) The buds pop out of my ears when they get wet from sweat from exercise. All 3 sizes of plastic earpiece covers do the same thing.3) The sound quality is mediocre; bass response is especially weak.4) After less than one month's use, the volume on the left earpiece dropped to around 1/4 of the volume of the right.All in all, I'm thankful therefore for Amazon.com's return policy; I'll use the money from the refund to buy a different set of earphones."
1,Rubber Coating Issue is Serious,My White MDR-EX81 has now disintegrated where the rubber wire coating has rips in many places and very gummy and sticky. It is as if it is melting away. Bad chemistry. It's easily tangled and irritating to undo it - also due to sticky coating. This product has been discontinued by SONY. Do not buy this product!!!
3,"A good buy, if it fits.","For me, my ears are too small, and so the extra latches that go around the ear don't do anything but weigh the earphones down. As an earphone, they function perfectly, but becuase the frame is too large, they are uncomfortable.I'd go with the MDR-EX71SL ones without the ear fixtures."
1,disappointed,"I've got no complaints with the sound versus the price. After 3 months of use and use in the gym, the rubber cord melted off the copper cables! Perhaps the sweat degrades the cable coating or something. These are decent earphones as long as you don't plan to work out in them or expose them to moisture."
1,Broke After 90 Day Warranty Expired,"Sony has an ultra-short 90 day warranty on these headphones. Mine broke after the warranty expired. I'd expect that from a cheap set of earbuds, but not from an expensive set made by a name like Sony. I'll try a different brand next time."
