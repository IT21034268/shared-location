5,Great casual shoe,"These are my fourth pair bought over an eight year period. They are only available in the states so each time I visit I make sure I buy a pair!They are tremendously comfortable, hard wearing & smart enough for work as well as casual use.Quiet possibly the best shoes I've ever bought."
4,"Simple, comfortable, dry","These shoes perform as advertised. They are easy to put on, very comfortable and keep your feet dry walking in the rain. I use these to walk to the office in NYC and they are perfect. Would recommend or buy again."
1,new mocs no mas.,"old mocs fit great feel great new mocs do not fit the same,very shabby construction.tried two different pair and both were poorly made.i will not buy merrell after that experience."
2,They better FIT,If you are not sure of your size do not order from Shoe Mart. It is very expensive to return them
2,Awful.,"Very disappointed in these shoes. I have a normal foot, yet they are way too loose on the back (heel), and way too tight in the front (toes.) Also the left shoe creaks, loudly, with every step. They are also not very attractive, and feel like badly-fitting slippers. The soles are VERY slippery - unlike what some other of the other reviews say, I was suprised at just how slippery these shoes are on a wet floor.On the positive side, they seem to be water proof, and durable (except for the creaking!)I would NOT recommend these."
4,Comfy and good fit!,The recipient liked the feel of these slippers. Very comfortable and fit very nicely. The only complaint was the tread being too faint but that was an afterthought at best!
5,Great Shoe,"Writing this review as the buyer/observer. Having wide, flat feet it has always been difficult to find shoes that felt good on my husband until I found him these Merrells. This is the second pair of Jungle Mocs, the first being the nubuck leather and one thing to note, the smooth leather Moc fits a bit looser than the nubuck although not enough to change from your regular size. For him, being a triple or quadruple E, the slight variation in the stretch of the smooth leather is preferable. I intend to continue buying the Jungle Mocs whenever necessary as long as they are available."
4,Merrell Jungle Moc,"I really like these shoes, they do seem to run wider than normal when you get a wide width so be sure to check your fit before ordering. I have had them for a year now, I did scotch guard them at first and they now still look like new."
5,best shoe i've ever owned,A very comfortable shoe. Best I've ever owned and well worth the $$. Left them at a hotel in Santa Fe and never got them back. Cleaning person must have liked them as much as me.
5,Great shoes,These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. I've been wearing Merrill shoes for years and refuse to put my feet in anything else.
2,"Nice Shoe, But Not Durable","I really liked these shoes for the first two years, but they began to separate where the leather meets the sole. Now my feet get wet if I walk in the lawn with dew on the grass. I didn't wear them enough for the tread to show wear, yet they failed after only two years."
1,The soles of these wear out entirely too fast!!!,"Got these as a Christmas gift two weeks ago. Looked at the soles today out of curiosity - found that the outer corners of the heels have already worn away at least an 8th of an inch. I only wear these early in the morning and late at night to walk my dogs for 15 minutes each time, it's easy to just slip them on and get going, I don't wear them anywhere else. So, 28 dog walks X 15 min each = 1/8th wear? At this rate these won't last me until the memorial day. Terrible quality of the soles!!!"
5,Great,"Great deal, fast ship no issues? Feel nice on the feel like walking on air, they were a much better price online then in stores"
4,Nice pearl ring,"I gave the ring to my wife for Christmas, and she was very pleased. She has several other rings I have given her throughout the years, and this pearl ring is definitely one of her favorites."
1,Peppers Made of Air,"These peppers would be good if Ethnicgrocer.com would send them to you, but they won't. Don't even bother. Check their awful feedback, as I should've done before ordering this."
5,A Must For Artie Shaw Fans,"Artie Shaw's is my favorite big band, especially the years with Helen Forrest. Like another reviewer I ended up buying a second set, but in my case, because I misplaced the first set (since found). Well worth it even at double the price."
4,The Complete Artie Shaw,"This is a superb collection of most of the clarinet masters finest recordings. It covers the full range of his remarkable career. It's also significant as an historical musical document. The sound quality of the CD is quite good. The only thing disappointing is the fact that there are relatively few selections from his 1953 and 1954 recordings, which arguably were his best."
5,A Superb Overview,"If you know nothing about Zoroastrianism and are looking for a basic understanding of this unique faith then start with this book. It is concise clear and covers all major points of the faith quickly and accurately. The five chapters cover Zoroaster, history, scripture, teachings and observances. The scripture section contains outtakes from not only the fragments that we have of the Avesta but also lesser known and extremely difficult to find religious texts such as the Denkard. If you want to know about Zoroastrianism this is the place to start."
4,good book,"its very dry reading and must say at the point it started to sound like islam, I wanted to put the book down. Meh, thats just me, dont like manipulation or others trying to control me. Loved the history and realness of this book as history of one of the first religions!"
5,burn them... without turning back,thats right .. not even a single coaster (as many others said) ... I did have one. but that was 'coz of some other reason ... there was no problem with these discs. I have burnt about 80 of these .. no probs so far ...cheers
4,good stuff,"burned probably around 10 dvds so far, have had no problem...these are good DVD+R's and great price with the rebate when i got them. I would recommend these to anyone who needs good quality DVD's at a good price...."
5,Great product at a great price.,"Verbatim is a pretty good brand compared to others, I've never had any issues with these discs."
1,Poor Packaging during shipping,It seems the shipper has not learned that you must put padding in large boxes with small heave dense items as they will surely flop around and break when shipped. This is twice I have ordered and twice this was done. They will not get a third chance.
2,poor compatibility,while the verbatim has burned well in 100% of my recordings they fail to operate in at least 24 different dvd players.
3,"great price, great media, crappy shipping","great price, great media, worst shipping i've ever seen; very poorly packed. all you can do is hope too many don't break."
3,Title Goes Here,"Yes I got them, Yes they work, I had 5% bad so far. The packaging was damaged when I got them but still sealed... Not packaged properly for shipping. These are sandwich disks so don't dropem on their edge or you'll have 2 nothings for the price of something :)!Go to a store, a small store. Support your local economy!"
1,Shipping the worst I ever saw,"The item, which was somewhat heavy, was put in a big box with hardly any filling material, allowing it to bounce around during shipping. You win the prize for the worst shipped item ever."
3,mediocre,I have used Memorax in the past. Verbatim disappointed me as quality is not nearly as good. I had to discard at leat 20% of the DVDs due to problems that I never encountered with Memorax.
5,"Genuine MCC003, highly recommended","My two spindles turned out to be MCC-003-000. Did a test burn on a Plextor PX-712A - 4480 MB at 12X - scanned with PlexTools Pro on the same; the scan was simply amazing (PIE under 10, PIF under 3). Not even genuine Taiyo Yuden burns this well on my setup.The discs have matte finish tops which is handy against dust and fingerpints."
1,Horrid longevity--archiving is near impossible,"Personally, I purchased these discs because the manufacturer of my DVD burner recommended this brand as fully compatible. Well, they burn no problem and read without a hitch for about 2-3 months. BUT, try to read discs burned over 6 months ago, and it becomes extremely difficult for the drive to read it. If reading the entire disc, it takes 20+ times of recleaning and re-inserting the disc to eventually get it all. Once they are over a year from burning DVD players will freeze up half-way through playing it. This does it for me for write-once DVD's. Now that +RW's are cheaper and newer DVD players can play them, I'm just sticking to them."
2,"Infamous ""Eat Me"" Branch",This branch looks colorful and is easy to clean off due to it's plastic components. Birds also enjoy sitting on the branch but eat it as well. They will eat the gummy-like rubber red parts of the branch and the same material on the leaf. Also they have bitten a small hole through the plastic green leaf.Although the branch is non-toxic I do not enjoy pets snacking on the branch as they would on an edible wood branch. Maybe better for smaller birds such as parakeets.
4,Terrific!,"Whoever said there wasn't enough Chris Squire in this performance must have missed the end of ""Long Distance Runaround"". I just endured 20 minutes of his long drawn out bass solo. If that wasn't enough for your Chris Squire jones nothing will satisfy it. Steve Howe, as always, is FLAWLESS! Jon still sounds good and their legendary harmonies still sound great. Rick Wakeman is and always will be the master of the keyboards. Great quality DVD. I just wish they had more of their classic hits."
4,Yes: Live at Montreux 2003... YES INDEED...,I'm a fan of Montreux DVD's & recordings in my opinion they are so well done professionally taped & recorded & this DVD by Yes is no exception... Yes were in fine form here & put on a really good show... There isn't much more to say other then if you are a huge fan of Yes then you need to get this... To me it's one of the best DVD's out there on the market & it represents Yes in a properly done way the quality here is very good... This is the way DVD's are professionally done folks... GET IT & ENJOY IT... YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED....
4,Yes Live at Montreux,I purchased this DVD to experience a music concert on my new blu ray player and 1080p set. I was not disappointed. Picture quality is pristine and the sound quality of this disc is awesome. In particular I loved the Rick Wakeman and Steve Howe solo sections. the band was in good form and the instrumental mastery that I am used to seeing from the group overcame the slightly quizzical song choices of this concert. I look forward to seeing more titles from this series at Montreux.
2,The is not a good performance,"I thought this performance was lame and fell way short of my expectations. I am not a true Yes fan but I own the Fragile album and think it is very good. The lead singers voice is very week and sounds off key, the bass solo had no substance, the music has no energy, and the music seems a little slow. I am glad I test drove this album on Netflix before getting this one."
4,OK Not the Best Video or Sound but....,"It's great to see these guys play the old songs. I missed seeing Yes in 1977 and sure this will never replace that but it's great to see musicians of this caliber in Blu-ray. I agree with the comments on video and sound issues but this is not U23D. Given the newness of this technology in 2003 and the fact that it's a generic recording from the folks at Montreux - it's not bad.I'm not a Yes nut - just enjoy seeing music from when I formed my music foundation (e.g. Yes, ELP, Led Zeppelin, etc). This was a great era! However, I don't live in the past - bands like Wilco, Gomez and My Morning Jacket keep the fires burning.Buy the CD - have some fun!"
3,44 yes shows,"I'M SORRY BUT THIS IS JUST ANOTHER YES ""LIGHT"" (AS IN LIGHT BEER) SHOW. I'VE SEEN YES 44 TIMES AND I KNOW WHEN THEY ARE PLAYING TO THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. WHERE'S THE PUNCH? WHERE'S THE BASS, ITS ALL TOO COMPRESSED. YOU NEED TO HEAR ALL THE INSTRUMENTS BUT NOT AT THE SAME LEVEL ALL MIXED INTO A MONOTONE YES.Yes: Live at Montreux 2003"
1,This is NOT the YES that I remember.,"Being a lifelong YES fan (the original band up to and NOT including the Trevor Rabin era and beyond) and based on the 5 star reviews here, I purchased this DVD with high hopes. Well, this DVD is a MAJOR dissapointment for me. The performance is very weak and lifeless. The sound is just plain bad (I'm not a fan of all this wirless technology, e.g mics, etc) and I think that adds to the sound problems. Each member of the band appears to be making the moves without putting anything into the performance - it all just appears dull and boring - there is no spark to their playing - something is missing, bigtime!As much as I would like to see a current YES performance on DVD of all the songs on this DVD, I just could not recommend this DVD to anyone - YES fan or not. It's a lifeless performance with bad sound. SKIP THIS ONE."
3,Yes,Nostalgic trip back to 70's. OK production and sound. Not what I remembered from the good ole days.
1,disk failure,"It's hard to tell if I would have liked the content of this DVD since there was nothing on it. I received the first copy and there's nothing there, I returned it and received the replacement about two weeks later and lo and behold there's nothing on it either. I tried it in several players so it's not my equipment. I almost felt like they had returned the same one to me after I sent it back."
3,"Undisputed:Cash Money Millionaires ""And Guests""","This soundtrack wasnt good but OK. But this album didnt live up to it's title. It is a Cash Money product and it does say ""Cash Money Millionaires"" on the front but there are less songs on this album by The Big Tymers, Lil Wayne, Boo & Gotti, the Cash money Millionaires themselves. There are way too many guests in this album, there are only like 9 out of 21 songs in this album by Cash Money and the rest are by other guests such as: Petey Pablo, Benzino, Trick Daddy, and Carl Thomas. They should've put more of Baby, and Lil Wayne etc. to this album. My Favorite tracks on this album are: Undisputed, We Drop it, Real Talk, Everyday, and I Walk It.(All cash money tracks). I didnt like this album much, but its still in my Cash Money Record collection anyways."
5,New Product,I bought this as a replacement product for a noxzema brand I used. I have been very happy with it and the shipping was quick. Excellent Product
2,Can't even use it,"I owned a similar version, different brand, of this fan for about 5 years and decided it was time for a new one (I use the fan while I'm sleeping for background noise so it is used everyday) not seeing the brand I currently owned I went with the stanley. Maybe I just got a lemon but this fan is awful...after one use it began to rattle (loudly) I tried adjusting the tilt, ran quitely for about 20 mins then RATTTTLE RATTLE RATTLE again, tried it on full speed, tried it on low, it doesn't matter what I do the fan sounds like it's coming apart at the seams. Angry and sleepy I unplugged it and went to Walmart the next day to buy another fan($15.00). Sure it would work on a construction site but it still should not sound as though it is falling apart inside. Especially not for the price!! I have not returned it because I was so certain of it that I kept nothing, not the box, not the packing slip, nothing. My loss I guess."
5,Worth It.,"If you want a fan that moves a tremendous amount of air efficiently, Just buy this. Simple as that.You can spend $30 less on something else, but I doubt it'll do as good a job as this will. It's reasonably compact, reasonably quiet, well built and serves the purpose well. I use this at my office to move air down a long corridor that wasn't ducted during construction, and it works brilliantly."
4,Exactly what I was looking for.,"I bought this to replace the same Blower I had used for a couple of years to move warm air from our stove around the house in the colder months. The fan works great but, I had to scavenge the squirrel cage from my old fan due to a balancing problem with the new one."
3,Not a fan,Its a good sturdy fan and its a Stanley so it will last but the reviews are a little over rated.Not sure if it is worth $50. Its smaller than you think and doesn't blow as hard as everyone says. Its doing the trick for me here in Tucson AZ but its not a massive fan.Not that loud either even at the high setting. This fan is probably worth $30 if it wasn't a name brand.
1,Poor volume,Very quiet but blows air like an old man with asthma. I bought 2 of these for a shop and wish I hadn't. High speed puts out about a 1/3 of what I expected.
4,HELP HOW TO OPEN FAN TO FIX IT,"Tthis is a turbine style fan that moves significant air. It works very well, much better than blade based fans of the same or even larger sizes.But in the end, dust and dirt will collect within this unit, considerably affecting performance.This is in itself not a problem but opening it up, unfortunately is.All housing is plastic, surrounding all screw holes, and the unit appears to be glued together, so opening it up is not at all easy.There are screws on the handle and underside, but it still requires pulling apart--we broke this as we disassembled it.We've been told the lasko model that is more powerful is easier to open but no confirmation on this. The heavy duty 120$ shop unit, as noted in a customer review, has the same problem as this one. VERY DIFFICULT TO OPEN TO CLEAN."
1,Failed After Two Months,"My fan failed after two months. When I called for warranty relief I was told I needed a sales reciept. I should have purchased it from Amazon instead of a local retail outlet I guess, because we discarded the receipt shortly after purchase. So, we are out of luck. Service from Lasko is sub-par at best."
2,"High power, low quality","This is one of the most powerful fans you can buy for a decent price. The air stream is very narrow so it will likely be best for a single person. The power outlets are very handy! The biggest negative about this fan is the cheap plastic connections that join the power switch to the fan housing. If the fan takes a direct hit in that area, even just being tipped over it's pretty much ruined. I can't find it at Wal-mart anymore."
3,5 stars for the fan; 2 stars for the delivery,Great fan. But it took the company over two weeks to deliver it.... Not good if you are experiencing 100+ degree weather.
3,Cheaply made and moves very little air.,"I bought this and the Lasko 4900 Pro. The difference is night and day. Where as the Stanley unit is cheaply put together and moves little air, the Lasko 4900 Pro moves MUCH more air, and just seems to be more solid in look and feel."
4,Whoosh,A friend suggested trying this unitSanding and working under a boat in Floridasummer heat.Works was cooler and helped with the dust.Have used in the garage too on hot afternoonsSo far happy with it.
4,Fantastic,"This small, light weight fan puts out a good stream of air. I have owned these before and someone always ran off with it before I could wear it out. This is one of those products you buy again and again and hope it will always be available."
3,"Just a ""Good"" Fan","For the price the fan is pretty good, but not great. It is very small and not very powerful, but for the low price it is acceptable. For the purpose of moving air around a moderately sized room, it is efficient."
3,"Don't get too excited just because it is called a ""blower""","This fan is only rated for 310 CFM on high speed, per the manufacturer. On the plus side, though, it does appear to be well-made and durable."
3,Poor quality!,"I received this organizer as a gift after having put it on my amazon wishlist. While it does come with a fair number of dividers and labels, the plastic container itself is cheap. The lid is not secure and it gaps at all of the seams. Does it hold cards? Yes. Is it worth the price? Absolutely not. This is a dollar store item at best."
1,Junk,"Not worth the money I spent on it -- because of pics posted by another purchaser, I thought this unit was going to be similar to the Hallmark card organizer I have. Wrong! This is a cheapy little plastic unit not big enough for one year's worth of cards. I do not recommend."
4,they are great,"The Immortals Quartet are really good books, but I thought that ""Wolfspeaker"" was a bit boring. I would definately recommend them."
5,Murano Magic,"Having recently returned from Venice, I wish I had this book before I left. Mr. Gable's meticulously researched volume offers so much valuable information, any glass collector or any tourist interested in a deeper perspective of the glass art of the city should read this book. The author's grasp of the nuances of the various styles is masterful and gave me a whole new appreciation of the experience I had in Venice."
3,Out of my reach,"This is a wonderful depiction of the upper end Murano art glass and its history, however I purchased this book hoping to have an aid in identifying the pieces I have in my collection or whatever I may add - the more 'garden variety' Murano. Chances are great that I'll never come across any of the items shown in this book. Otherwise, it is a pleasure."
1,What a disappointment......,"I got this movie for my grand-daughter, she's 8. We watched the 1hr 2min movie together. I can say that we were both very disappointed. At several points during the movie my grand-daughter said...""Paw Paw, is this a real movie?? It looks like somebody make it with a video camera"" She was right. Story's not that great either. I could not recommend this movie to anyone. How somebody gave it a 5, I don't know. Maybe they were related to the film-maker(term used loosely)."
1,Waste Of Time,Watched about 30 min of this movie before my 11 year old walked out of the room and my 7 year old asked me to turn it off because it was stupid. The video quality is equivalent to that of youtube. The story is not creative. I would not recommend this movie even to a person I disliked..
5,Meow Meow Masterpiece!,"I liked Marcello! This is awesome movie for cat lovers everywhere! Be warned it has real actor voices and is actually shot with what looks like a personal camcorder, once you are sucked in to Marcello's adventure you won't be able to turn it off! Kudos to the studio for taking a risk! I would recommend this to everyone!"
1,Very poor,Very poor book and among the 20 or so books I have on the subject - this is no doubt the worse. It does not make me the least inspired. Sorry to say - but do not buy it.
3,packaging and handling,"there was no packaging for this item and it was obviously treated poorly because it came to the house with numerous dings and was bent. The job the description said should take 30 min. took almost 4hours because hole wouldn't line up so I had to remove the part and bend it back to align the holes. Also, one of the welds was of poor quality. Ill have to keep an eye on it to make sure its not going to fail."
1,"NO STARS,pure garbage and noise","I don't listen to GG anymore,I never thought he had any real musical talent, except for on HATED IN THE NATION,I listened to him becuase I thought he was funny. I bought the cassette of SUICIDE SESSIONS and it was the worst thing I heard in my life. I returned it. I was embarrassed for buying it let alone returning it.Just noise and you cant unnderstand what he's saying.I can play the guitar better than the idiot that did on this. IF YOU REALLY MUST BUY ANYTHING FROM GG ALLIN,GET HATED IN THE NATION.PLEASE DONT WASTE MONEY ON THIS. ALSO BUY GG CD's ONLINE<that way people wont look at you like a MORON."
5,survival guide makes staying at home a reality!,"This is an accessible, practical and easy to follow guide to help parents with the important but somewhat daunting thought of staying home full-time with the children. Tinglof's style is full of humor and ease, helping the reader feel comfortable about the subject and ready to make the attempt! The book is thorough without being cumbersome. I especially liked the tips provided by other parents which are dispersed throughout the book. There is a real feeling of contact with other struggling parents! Christina Baglivi Tinglof has provided a wonderful examination of parenting and how staying at home can work for so many of us."
2,I could've written this myself,"The book and chapter titles sound promising, but unfortunately the content fails to deliver. She just skims the surface of these issues and says nothing that isn't common sense."
5,Works great,"It suctions to the shower wall very well. Works great, you can tell it is high quality and will last a long time."
4,"maybe, maybe not","The squeegee is great, but the suction hanger does not hold on tiles. I would have preferred a hole in the handle. Now I have to drill a hole, and throw out the suction hanger."
3,OXO Good Grips All-Purpose Squeegee,This squeegee does not work as well as the OXO Good Grips black blade squeegee. I set it aside as a backup if needed.
5,Works great~,This squeegee works great! Really removes the water from the shower walls without much effort. Very happy with this one.
4,I use this every day,I use this squeegee on all of the mirrors and windows in the house. The size is nice because I can easily carry it around in my cleaning bucket. The blade is great quality and doesn't streak at all. It is tough and sturdy. I think it will last for years to come. The only thing I don't care for is the thickness of the handle. I have petite hands and I think it would be easier to handle with a more slender handle.
5,#1 product,Best squeegee ever!! Have had 3 others so far and none work as well as this one. OXO is the best!
3,Look closely at the product pictured!!!,"Squeegee does a reasonable job, however there are design issues I would have noticed if I looked at the picture longer. The handle is very short, too small for my average sized man-hands. The suction cup doesn't hold on tile. It might hold suction on glass, but isn't that what we're trying to squeegee??? And there's no hole in the handle for hanging via a hook. My opinion? Buy something else..."
4,"It works well, but ...","This OXO all purpose squeeze works well, it has soft blade which works well on both glass panel and tiled wall.However, I have found that the handle is a bit too short, it will be very nice if the handle is a few inches longer and that is the reason I decided not to give 5 star."
3,ok,good product for the price and came in a timely manner. the suction cup barely sticks anywhere in my shower though!!! I have plastic walls with the glass non-see-through doors. Barely sticks-falls a lot. I like the idea of this but its also time consuming to use. I think I'd rather buy an automatic shower cleaner or an after shower spray. But if you are really anal and will use it every time you shower-AND others will use it then its a great product and good price. I really like the OXO brand I have bought a lot from them.
5,Wonderful Size and Sticks!,This is a great item because its a perfect width and is light and easy to use. 3 swipes down one of the shower doors and that's it! It hangs perfectly and attaches well to the tile in the tub. Very good quality product.
3,Need a Reason,"I ordered this squeegee based on its good reviews and because I was told one really needs it to keep the shower door clean. Well, I find that our shower door stays pretty nice and gets a good cleaning weekly. However, a couple of spots did come off the shower door with the squeegee in an easy process. I have to find more reason to use this item that I thought I needed. Friends are suggesting different uses and I certainly look forward to trying it out with different tasks."
4,It works,"I don't love it, nor do I hate it. It just does the job well for cleaning glass or windows."
3,"Love the handel, has a good feel",All in all I like it. the holder is strong and never falls off in the shower. I think the problem is the blade is made of very soft rubber and its hard to keep a line on the edge of the shower door or wall. all in all i like it though.
1,Terrible product.,"I bought this because of the good reviews, but I can't understand how we can be talking about the same product.May be I received items from a defective lot, but I ordered 2 and both of them are bad. The suction cup does not stay on the bathroom tile wall. I tried it with water, without water. It stays on until the squeegee rests on it, then it lasts about 5 seconds and comes tumbling down.The squeegee leaves streaks of water behind, similar to results from old and degrade windshield wipers in cars. I'm returning for refund."
5,Great Squeegee,I love this product like I love all my OXO products. The suction cup is big and works great. The handle is comfortable and it works like a charm. Does the job and at a good price! I got free shipping which was an added bonus too!
3,So close,"The blade is nice and flexible, it's light-weight, it comes with a suction-cup hook and the handle is very comfortable to hold. HOWEVER, the handle is too short. When I use it to squeegee water downward (which is primarily what you do in the shower), I get water all over my hand. Oxo almost had a real winner with this one."
1,Leaves water trails,After seeing all the positive reviews I decided to buy this squeegee to use on my glass shower doors. Relying on the positive reviews was a mistake. To be honest with you this is probably the worst squeegee out there. It leaves trails of water and you can see water spots after it dries. Very cheap material. Don't make the same mistake I did and stay away from it
4,does what it should,"I use this to wash my windows, it fits perfect in the panes of my french doors. leaves a good streakless finish."
5,works just fine,couldn't find one in the store.... the wall suction cup has never fallen off either.
4,Effective little squeegee,"We use this squeegee after every shower to dry the tile walls and glass door, and it works better than the professional window-cleaning model we formerly used. It is ergonomically designed, is effective on tile, and is a great value to boot. I do wish it were a bit wider; that would save some time in using it. But that's my only complaint."
4,Squeegee,"The actual squeegee works great in the shower, but the suction cup to hole it up does not stay in place. It tends to slide down on the wall when it is wet or fall off when it is dry. But the squeegee is the best I have ever used."
3,Product does at is says,It does at it say's only I wish the wiper on it was a little firmer as its a little softer than most which makesme have to go over the glass doors twice. Not a big deal but the one I purchased for my Mother that was an oxo brand works better than these ones.
2,squeegee,"The sides were too flimsy, ended up going to ACE hardware and purchasing one that had reinforced sides making the task much easier."
3,Just Okay,"I was trying to replace my old squeegee but could only find short ones. My old one was 6"" wider, more efficient. This is a good squeegee, not as good as my old one."
2,Wouldn't buy it again!,I bought this squeegee 2 months ago and I already buying another one. Thankfully it was under $15! The rubber bit is too flimsy on the ends and doesn't wipe away the water in the corners of my frameless glass shower. And the suction-holder falls off the walls at least once a week. I wouldn't recommend this item.
1,Too short handle,"I should have listened to the past reviewer regarding the length of the handle.Handle is way too short. And the suction cup is useless. It fell every time I hung it up. Since the handle does not have a hole in it, there is no way of hanging it from a hook that sticks. Now it sits on the shower floor. Very disappointed."
2,Doesn't work,"I bought this because I love that it has the holder. Ended up just keeping the holder to hold the cheaper-but-better-working squeegee we bought from the local hardware store. This oxo squeegee did not work in our bathroom, it left streaks of water on the surface we were cleaning. Useles, giving it two stars because at least the holder was useful."
5,Still Good After 3 Months,"Several of the reviews complained that this squeegee was too stiff. It is stiffer than what we had before but it is also a lot wider and thus it ends up working just as well. I expect this one to last whereas the corners on the previous one started tearing after a few months. We have had ours for about 3 months now and we use it every day to wipe down the shower doors. It works as well now as when we first bought it. Also the suction cup holder is still in place after all this time, which is amazing. The suction cup would not hold to the shower wall as the wall has a textured surface but the corner shelves are smooth and the suction cup adheres to them just fine. I expect this to last for years and will probably buy another for the other bath."
2,Altogether too dainty,I'm generally a fan of OXO products. This product was purchased to replace another squeegee I have been using for several years without complaint but had reached end of life. The handle and blade on the OXO are too small and the blade too thin to be useful. I had read complaints about the suction cup. Oddly enough I had no problems with that feature.
2,squeeeeak,"I've had this for about 2 weeks. The first few days it worked great. Now whenever I use it, no matter the angle or pressure, it squeaks. The sound is awful!"
1,NOT for textured glass,"EDIT for clarity::I purchased this to replace a similar one I use on my shower door which has a slight texture to it. The product did not work at all for my shower door, it left water behind after multiple attempts so I was forced to purchase another brand that works fine.This may work on flat glass and mirrors (never tried) but it still isn't very high quality, and I would not recommend it for anyone as you may need to purchase a second squeegee in the future."
2,Major Design Flaw,"The handle is too short! The squeegee performs well, except for that short handle. Why is the short handle an issue? When you swipe the squeegee down a glass, tile or solid surface wall and meet a horizontal surface, such as the top of a bathtub, the too-short handle causes your hand to hit the horizontal surface before the squeegee blade has cleared the wall. This fault is a major disruption in your ability to work in a smooth and fast rhythm.I have another squeegee that I think is ideal, made by the Magic American Products (inexpensive and available from Home Depot and from the company's web site). The handle is approximately 8"" long, whereas this OXO model is only approximately 3-1/2"" long. Too Short!"
5,ten squigees outta ten^^^^^^^^^^,I keep this in the trunk for quick windshield cleanup. Good product that seems like it might actually last a while too.
4,Works well,"Been searching for a good squeegee. Soft pliable rubber gets water off tile and glass door easily. Less work to keep the glass clean. Have hard well water so it's very important to get it all off so it won't stain tile or make the glass reallly difficult to clean. Suction holder will not stick to the flat hard tile, but that is not a big issue for me. All is alll, good choice and worth the few extra dollars. Only had it a few weeks. If it endures longevity, I would purchase it again."
4,Wish it came in all clear,"This squeegee works perfectly for our large glass shower stall surround, as well as for the marble portions of the shower. It is attractive enough, but I wish it came in an all clear color or something less obtrusive for a marble shower. There is a stainless steel version that would probably look nice in many showers with chrome/nickel fixtures, but ours happens to have a lot of brass/gold fixtures, so this white/black version was a better choice (but still detracts from the look of the shower). I try to hide it towards the bottom of the shower area, but it doesn't look great."
5,works well for it's purpose!,"This simple plastic/rubber squeegee works well for my shower doors. I only have to do each column once, and it's done. great squeegee. I haven't tried any of the others, I bought this off of reviews."
5,Excellent design on many counts,"This is an attractive, functional squeegee. It works well on my shower curtain, my tiled walls and my porcelain bathtub. The blade is 10-inches long. It is molded into the handle, so there is no gap where mildew can form. The blade is flexible and, contrary to some other reviews, based on my experiments does not squeak unless I hold it close to perpendicular and move it slowly across a fairly dry surface. If you have any trouble getting the suction cup holder to stay in place, just try putting a thin film of water-based lubricant on it before you smush it on the wall."
1,"Disappointed in OXO, not Amazon","Usually OXO makes a great product, and I always trust Amazon to sell/represent the best for my needs. I purchased the all purpose squeegee and it lasted two weeks before the shape of the blade curled and no longer cleaned my shower stall surface. Returning costs too much so I just ordered another brand, hope it works. Stay away from this product, in this day making a mistake is costly."
4,no suction,"Great little squeegee, but it's always on the shower floor. The suction cup holder won't stay put. It curls around the edges and falls."
2,Terrible,"I'm a huge GG fan and I can't stand this album. The songs are recorded in one take with seemingly no rehearsing, and the production quality is abysmal. There are a couple of gems on here--""Die When You Die"" and ""Outlaw Scumf**"" are GG classics--but as a whole it's not worth the money. If you must get an album from this point in GG's career, ""You Give Love A Bad Name"" is a lot more fun to listen to."
2,This is something.,"This guy has some interesting things to say but in reality, and after you take in the whole of everything, is a joke to any real artist on the planet. I know that offends people but this guy doesn't even have the intelligence to represent punk much less the talent to even hack it. He's an idiot, he's dirtier than sin, and has absolutely not one lick of skill along with the smallest wang I have ever seen. This is not punk. This a magnet for retards. If people think this is cool well then cool is not the place to be kids. The end. Am I punk yet?I'm sorry but I agree with some of the points of view expressed by this guy. But when you take it this far, and live like he does, I can only feel sorry for his upbringing and the hatred he feels towards everyone. None of it makes a whole lot of sense in the end. I give it two stars because of the anti-authority message. Other than that...."
5,god of fire in hell,G.G. best was described as true to life gutter trash without a care for anyone or anything but this album truly puts him into perspective showing that he was not an animal but a person like you and me it emphasizes his hate and puts it all into an energy and raw power with songsa like commit suicide and die when you die so if you love G.G. check it out
1,Atrocious!,"Not even rateable! One star is WAY too much! []even though I'm not offended personally, this is just plain atrocious! Being a hardcore fan, I'd heard lots about GG, but I didn't realize how bad his msuic was. Even the Dwarves ""Blood Guts and Pussy"" is better than this, and I'd heard THAT was one of the dirtiest albums ever made. However, if you like lyrics about rape, pedophilia, drugs, filthy sex, etc... you should feel right at home with this album. I'll stick with ""Damaged"" and ""Zen Arcade""!"
1,Ugh!,"When we were kids, we were told that if you can't say something good about someone, don't say anything at all.Something good about G. G. Allen? He's dead."
4,"Yes, it's sick. But that's what makes it good!","The music is disgusting and raw. The vocals are savage and one can tell GG ripped his throat up singing these songs. Everyone knows GG Allin was an ignorant nutcase who gleefully mutilated his body through drugs and violence. That's no reason to boycott the music. If anything, GG was real. The music, likewise, is real. No other artist can capture the brutal desperation which pervades this CD. It is the ultimate look into the mind of the criminally insane: From the grasping song, 'Dope Money' to the grotesque 'Young Little Meat.' By listening, you LIVE the seedy, crass filth of GG Allin. You watch bloody horror movies don't you? Well, I listen to bloody horror music. Get over it."
3,None more vile....,"This is GG's magnum opus (at least of his later career). It features such ditties as ""Suck My A-- it Smells"", ""Die When You Die"", and my personal favorite ""Commit Suicide"" (a song that actually encourages suicide and is very catchy!)The music itself is some of GG's better later material, and the ""Bulge"" backing band manages to make a noise that is somewhere in between mid era Black Flag, the Ramones or Motorhead but more raw in many ways.The production is much better than some of the trashy sounding singles/splits that GG was also a part of during this period, and the lyrics are mostly intelligible which makes it all the funnier. The highlight though, is Suck My A-- it Smells. It only features one line ""Suck My A-- It Smells"" repeated over and over. Fans of the film Hated will also recognize this song as the one they played for GG's high school music teacher! This is essential GG, no matter how disgusting, vulgar, and bigoted the lyrics are. The man was nuts so enjoy the show!"
5,A Classic from The Heritage Press 3-Volume Set of Shakespeare's Plays,"The 3-volume set of Shakespeare's plays (Tragedies, Comedies, Histories) published in 1958 by Heritage Press remains a classic.The Histories, beautifully bound and printed, and featuring magnificent wood-engravings by John Farleigh, remains my favorite edition to read when I want to savor the plays without footnotes and annotations.Each play contains an introduction by Peter Alexander, who was Regis Professor of English Laguage and Literature in the University of Glasgow. A Glossary is included at the end of the book.Heritage Press editions are still undervalued. The Shakespeare plays are especially appealing and I recommend that you buy all three volumes while they are still reasonably priced."
5,Shakespeare Histories,I was very pleased to receive the collection of Shakespeare's Histories. The order was in very good condition and was sent to me very promptly. I was highly satisfied.
1,Shocking Lack of Morality of Holocaust Complicity,"Author Peter Hayes displays a shocking, no astonishing, lack of moral indignation, in what struck me as a superficial review of IG Farben's complicity in Hitler's plans. He tends to gloss over the involvement of Farben's board in locating their facilities in concentration camps--asserting the men were only acting as good businessmen. Of course they were businessmen--businessmen who prospered at the expense of Jewish misery and deaths. I wish I could rate this book less than one star. I am more than disappointed."
1,IG Farben apologia,"This book paints the portrait of an improbable protagonist, a huge chemical cartel which is held up as the last bastion of liberalism and free trade in the early years in the Reich. As if that were not enough, Hayes implies that IG Farben could not risk their corporate profits to temper the Reich's worst abuses, and even if they had been bound by some corporate ethics, it wouldn&#65533;t have done any good anyway since they were powerless. This ridiculous thesis seeks to portray IG Farben as the last victim of Nazi aggression. Don&#65533;t be fooled by the extensive, but one dimensional sources used. Try instead Crime and Punishment of IG Farben by Borkin."
1,Why Not Tell the Unvarnished Truth,"The Truth is that IG Farben was an integral part of the Nazi killing machine, and that clearly does not come out of this book. Instead I see efforts to create an image of ""professionals"" struggling with policy predicaments in the Third Reich. Hayes should called a spade a spade, and a genocidal corporation and its directors exactly what they were too."
1,Intellctually disigenuous,"I kept waiting for the intellectual payoff, but like others, I only saw an elaborate series of staged extenuating circmstances and explanations for the conduct of these busnessmen and this corporation. I would have preferred reading more about the background of the directors, and what drove them to openly collaborate with the Third Reich. I can't agree with Peter Hayes' approach and understand why he concedes in his Intro that other historians have been less accepting of his work."
1,Poorly Written and Researched,"Poorly Written and Researched Poorly written and even more poorly researched, Hayes does not improve upon earlier efforts to understand this powerful company. At times, while reading Hayes' book, I kept asking myself why he seems to dance around the facts. Indeed, Hayes seems to be constructing a lawyer's defense brief for Farben. Hayes' weak grasp of German's nearly bankrupt position and its precarious economic standing internationally shows throughout Part II, The National Revival.To argue that Farben was unable to influence the course of Germany's actions seems to disregard the respected works of Schweitzer in Big Business and the Third Reich and Poole's Who Financed Hitler. Nor does Hayes improve upon the excellent Crime and Punishment of I.G. Farben by Borkin and indeed that book remains the preferable authority as I far as I'm concerned."
1,Hardly inconsequential,"Dr. Hayes maintains that the directors of Farben were inconsequential to the Nazi plan of extermination--even though the company maintained an extensive operation of murderous slave labor at Auschwitz, and otherwise colluded with the Hitler regime. Since it has been made clear that the post-war Farben financially sponsored Hayes' research, I cannot see how this book and its conclusions can be taken seriously. I think the sponsorship seeps into the fabirc of the book itself. The conclusion about Farben directors which Hayes offers, referred to above, is just one example of this book's lack of credibility. Independent research would demand that any investigation of Farben's history be conducted free from financial contributions by the company itself. Hayes' book--and its slant--should be read with that in mind."
5,Great Story!,This movie is so adorable. Ive had it for about 4 weeks and I just cant stop watching it. Im pretty good about controlling my emotions but I have to admit the first time I watched it the tears started flowing. Their love for one another seems so genuine. I thought it was going to be just another one of those fake porns but it was more of a true love story. This movie is a must see.
3,Documentary w/Erotica,"I was expecting a dramatic film, but the film was basically a documentary of two young women finding love. It was definately erotic and no nudityspared."
4,Cute Couple,If you're looking for a hot porn with fake sex this isn't the movie for you. This video is about showing the real relationship between two beautiful women who are openly expressing themselves and there love. It was really sweet and quite sexy watching them interact and hear how they first got together. Really great purchase if you want to know what really goes on in an intimate relationship with anyone whose trying to make a good impression on the other not just for lesbians. This was well worth the money I spent for it.
4,"Good Pictures, but....","I have purchased this calandar and really like it. There are pictures of each of the ten ""regular"" cast members (including both Jadzia and Ezri Dax) and the two primary ""recurring"" characters of Garak and Dukat. These pictures make up the tweleve months of the year. And in the center of the calandar, there is a picture of the Defiant in battle.The cast pictures are very nice, with the possible exception of Julian Bashir - I think they could have found a better picture of him. With each picture is a quote from that character, and I think they picked pretty good quotes. Additionally, the Defiant picture is nice as well.I'm not particularly crazy about the boxy look of the date boxes on the calandar...but I do like the fact that they put a notation on each DS9 cast members' birthday...kind of a nice touch.I think the calandar is worth the money...especially if you are a DS9 fan!!"
4,"Nice overall effort, Stop sleeping.....","The only thing that hampers this collection of nice music is the mixing job. That 2 second delay kills the overall package itself. Otherwise, 9th Wonder and Khrysis did a fabulous job here production wise. For Median's first overall effort, I'd give him two thumbs up. He's only going to get better in due time.Now, to tie those blends back together and make it complete...."
4,GREAT EP (2 years later I'd give it 5 stars),"Median is the most underrated lyricist in the game. This EP is better than most albums out there in 2006. Only ten songs but there is no song that is bad or sucks. The production mostly comes from 9th wonder & khrysis. This album reminds me a lot of stakes is high. He touches on everyday topics & relates to the everyday man as is evident on ""doing my dance"". I will give this my full recommendation & will say that this is a must have ep, if you're yearning for that real, skillfull, throwback hip-hop like ""stakes is high"" by De La Soul."
5,Food flipper,I used this handy food flipper very frequently and it works great for steaks and other firm foods. Shipping and packaging were good! You should try this! Great item!
2,Not better than a standard Rovner ligature.,"I bought this on speculation and after a few tries found it no better than my standard Rovner ligature, which is far less trouble to situate on the mouthpiece."
5,The Anthology of Southern Women Writers is Exceptional,"I purchased a this book as a requirement for a course I am taking. It is one I would have never though to buy on my own. For the rest of my life I will treasure this book. The stories in it are so well written you want to read them over and over to capture fully the meaning of every word. Going forward I will seek other works by these authors whose words paint unforhgettable pictures, and whose characters stay with you like old friends."
4,Right to the point,This is a very direct to the point with great illustrations book.The material is exposed with clarity and the formulas are very concise.Vibrant colors make it easy to understand and visualize the concepts.This is a must for manufacturing engineering.
4,Great New Musical Release by Producer Evan Beigel,Evan Beigel does it again with Tempermental Angel.
4,"Collected Sounds, Sweden","Gilli Moon's second album opens with a spoken word piece that's reminiscent of Laurie Anderson. Then the rest of the record unfolds and reveals itself to be a unique mix of accessible hooks, passionate vocals and heartfelt lyrics. Moon effectively captures a variety of moods with her music. The title track has its fair share of Alanis Morrissette's explosive nature. By contrast the ballad ""Why Do you Love Me Still?"" is tender and sweet and should top the lists in a fair universe. She's an intriguing new voice to listen out for. Anna Maria Stjärnell www.collectedsounds.com, Sweden"
1,"If you love Shakespeare, you'll hate this book.","THis is not a novel to be tossed lightly aside, but should be hurled with great force. The action starts off with Will being sexually molested by a former school teacher and it ends with Will stabbing a helplessly bound Marlowe in the eye. This is a dark, gloomy novel with none of the brightness of Shakespeare. Under a thin veil of historical accuracy, Cook writes a hatchett job on Shakespeare by adding completely inaccurate events. It also has a very homeo-erotice portion. Will has sex with Marlowe to look at Marlowe's plays. This is the most distasteful book about Shakespeare I've ever read."
5,History in color,This book is outstanding for War 2 history buffs. Even those who don't study that period should be intrigued with this graphic review of that era when we lost so many lives and changed so much of America's knowledge of what did and could happen to our country.
4,Seasoned Citizen Bike Rider,"Nice Classic Bicycle Saddle - Good Comfort, Easy to install w/small adjustable wrench, & delivered via UPS Ground seven calendar days from order date. Good value for the price."
1,not worth any price,"The seat is marketed as waterproof -- it is not. when the bike is left in the rain, the water penetrates through the material and is absorbed by the underlying cushion which acts like a sponge. The next several days as you ride, the water is then released through the seams wetting your pants/shorts. I never had this problem with the stock seat that came on my bike, any seat for that matter. On rides lasting more that 30 minutes my nether-regions become numb. This is the worst seat I've ever used."
2,Great cover - pity about the lack of emotion!,"From the reviews it seems I must be a minority. But heh, things appeal differently to people. I found this book so obvious that it was a trial just to finish the story. In fact I couldn't wait for the end. Perhaps if there was more of a sub-plot it would have been a keeper. However, the obvious girl meets ghost, girl becomes ghost and finds everlasting happiness was just too obvious. Pity because it was well written.But don't despair. This is passable to fill the time so long as you buy it second-hand!"
4,I love the Scottish brogue!,"I just downloaded the Kindle version. So I am unsure of the amount of usual formatting/typos that is common in Kindle editions.I have the hardcopy book of Everlastin' -- there, it has a glossary of Scottish terms that she uses. She writes very well using the Scottish Brogue. I am a sucker for the Scottish and Irish Brogues so if a book will indulge me it is a plus.I liked the story as well, not just the accent! I thought that the characters were well rounded; especially since one is a ghost and they still end up together! Unlike most romance heroines Beth does not make you want to strangle her :-) You end up liking BOTH the hero and heroine.I have read the rest of the series and found them wanting -- however whenever Lachlan and Beth show up the story picked up for me. Later I will retry the rest of the series but for the most part I think the storyline can stay in Everlastin' ""book 1""."
3,"Not what I'd expected, but still okay.","This book was one that I'd found on my ""search"" for a great, well thought out romantic ghost story. I read the other reviews and thought that this book might be exactly what I was looking for. It wasn't. It was a cute story, there was some humor, but it was kind of slow and predictable. I understood when I purchased this book that it was one of four, needless to say I won't be getting the other three."
5,Death never looked so good!,"Lachlan and Beth proved to me that there is someone out there for everyone...you just might have to look in another era to find them. Love will bring together those who are meant to be together, even if it means crossing the sands of time to accomplish this.Lachlan needed Beth to help him release himself from the hate that was keeping him from finding true love and happiness. Fate brought them together and love kept them together."
2,Everlastin' lasts forever!,"The Scottish character's dialogue was fun to read, at first, but, it got verra auld. 'Afore abou' an hoor, Ah'd `ad aneuch"
2,Everlastin',"I'm a sucker for Scottish paranormal romances. Almost all of my books I read multiple times. But I won't be picking this one back up for a second read. The book started out good. The plot had potential. Usually it's the ghost becoming living again, not the other way around. As I said it started out good, but it fizzled. The heroine, if you can call her that, was extremely annoying. She started out fine, but it took her almost the entire book to figure things out. I found myself skipping over so many parts because her inability to cope was killing me. I mean, just deal with it. The hero......... well, he seemed immature to me, in a way. I couldn't wait until I finished the book just to be done with it, and the character's annoying antics. It had promise, plenty of emotion... perhaps too much. The setting for the second book intrigued me, but I will not be reading it. I fear it will be too much like the first."
1,"Hoo, boy....","This book had promise (that's why I bought it): the plot had potential, and the characters started out fairly strong. But it became very stupid very quickly. And thanks to this author, I can't BEAR to hear a Scottish accent. This author should never, EVER try to replicate an accent in dialogue again!"

3,good for beginners,"This is a pretty good guitar. I've been playing with this guitar for about 1 1/2 years. The amp is so so for a practice amp. The fuse blew so i put in a bigger fuse and it is so loud! One problemof this guitar is that the guitar gets out of tune very often. The input jack on the guitar is also a problem. It loosens up and falls off after plugging and unplugging the cord a few times. But make no mistake, this guitar is a workhorse, and has served me well. The thing that drew me to it were it's looks. The paint has held up VERY WELL The tuner that is shown in the picture is not the one that arrives in the package. It comes with a VERY NICE QUIK TUNE tuner. I'm looking to get a standard fender strat because i'v been playing for some time. So, if your a beginner, and your looking for a reliable guitar, look no further."
4,very good!!!,This guitar is a great guitar I still use it. It has a very good sound and looks really cool. I love this guitar and have never thought about getting a knew electric guitar. It also comes with a small but very loud and great sounding amp. I would suggest you buy a tuner because it goes out of tune every once in a while. But other than that it is a very good guitar.
4,Pretty good,"I got this guitar for Christmas in 2003. I have played with it virtually nonstop (with a break for like half a year when my teacher died) and now I am back. I know a lot of songs. The guitar is great, and sounds great, for begginer. Unfortunately my tremolo bar messed up the inside so I can't use it anymore, but I don't mind too much. Plus the amp sucks, especially when using pedals or playing live. It's all right for home practice though. If this is your first guitar, go for it! If not, look into something more advanced."
2,There are better out there.,Don't buy this guitar/amp. You can get a fender for no more than $...they work really well and It will last you a long time wereas this yamaha will only give you limited satisfsaction. So if you're willing to spend only [this much] on a better guitar and a little more money on a MUCH better amp don't buy this set.
3,Unique and twisted,"This album blew my mind when I found it and picked it up at the local music shop. I've always been a fan of AC/DC and their heavy sound. I've also been a fan of rockabilly for quite some time, and I never imagined the two belonged on the same album and frankly I'm still not sure. I commend the artists for putting their best efforts into paying tribute to one of the top rock bands of all time. Their sound is awesome for rockabilly, but the AC/DC purist in me, would say this isn't very good. If you enjoy rockabilly (like I do)and treat it as a rockabilly album of someone elses songs, it's a very good album, so it is definately unique creation and to like it depends on the twist you enjoy. I'm lucky that I enjoy both. Just do me a favor and don't pay tribute to Led Zeppelin."
1,horrible,this shouldve/couldve been such a good cd. ac/dc songs could easily be done rockabilly but these guys sing em like theyre preforming them at an old folks home. very boring.i highly recommend the rockabilly tribute to the clash. thats top notch
2,green rubber gloves,"Green large rubber ""Wells Lamont 178L 15 Mil Nitrile 13-inch gauntlet, flocked lined, emboss grip gloves. Used for costume. Will use later on in the kitchen."
3,Dissenting vote,"I can appreciate Kula's approach to his work, and there is no doubt that many of the images function as either social commentary or drip with sexual freedom (or both). I like his stylistic treatment - the lack of definition makes me feel as though I am there... participating.So, why the dissenting vote? I am less impressed with Kula's self indulgence. I'll admit that while I love the work Rene Cox has done, I personally feel that making herself the subject of that work detracts from it. It is the bi-polarlarity of wanting to be in front of the camera and behind it at the same time (self-portraiture aside) that bothers me. Kula has indulged in this in the most provocative way. In a sense, my hat's off to him, yet some of the photos made me howl with laughter."
2,Not very interesting,"Sort of arty, but seems mostly an excuse for Kula to take photos of himself having sex with young women. Hardly ""erotic photography""! Not really worth buying unless you're into porn... want to buy my copy?"
3,"You'll look good, even if you don't see well.","I bought these glasses based on how they look. They look very nice, don't they? They are comfortable and fit well into my suit pocket, are very sturdy, and sport decent spring hinges. My only gripe is that the shape of the frame holds the glasses a bit too far away from my face so that sun still reaches my eyes.They are great car glasses, which is where I wear them. They're also great when worn with a ballcap. But if you are looking for glasses to wear out in the sun without a hat, I'd look for something else."
5,BERNADETTE PETERS IS EXCEPTIONAL!,This movie is absolutely haunting. I had seen it when it originally aired but recently got it on vhs and ended up watching it 2 nights in a row. The subtlety with which Bernadette Peters plays the role of the dying woman makes the characters impending death all the more heartrending. Her vulnerability coupled with her dignity really make you care deeply about what is happening to her. Mary Tyler-Moore also brings a necessary piece into this film with her sensitivity and compassion into her role as the caring therapist which coupled with Bernadette Peters portrayal complete the picture. They play off of each other brilliantly. Be forewarned that this movie is very sad but if you don't mind a lump in your throat and tears uncontrollably streaming down your face then this is the movie for you.
4,THOUGHT PROVOKING AND INSPIRATIONAL..,"UNSCRAMBLED EGGS by Nadia Brown is an interesting book of poetry. A thought provoking collection of poetry. Uplifting. While simply written it is a soulful account of one's inner self. If you enjoy poems, collections that are not only thought provoking but gives insight into everyday life,with a bit of wisdom and lot of love. Well written. Received for an honest review from the author.RATING: 4HEAT RATING: NONEREVIEWED BY: AprilR, My Book Addiction and More/My Book Addiction Reviews"
4,Good collection of poetry,"I enjoyed reading many of the poems in this collection. My favorites were 'Perfect' and 'Like You'. As a writer, the ""shared indignity"" of poets (and writers in general) resonated with me deeply."
3,Unscrambled Eggs by Nadia Brown,"Unscrambled Eggs by Nadia Brown is a great collection of poems written about nearly everything you could think of. Her unique voice and methods of description set her poems apart from anything else I've read. She has written these poems about things she is very passionate about and that shows through when you read them. For many, these poems are easily relatable, and you'll keep turning the page until you're through. This book will be enjoyed by anybody who appreciates the art that is poetry."
5,"""...A thought-provoking collection of poetry.""","""Unscrambled Eggs is a thought-provoking collection of poetry that deals with everyday life experiences.""""The author Nadia Brown dares to share the depth of her thoughts as an opportunity to encourage and empower readers to live your dreams and find your purpose in life."""
1,Disappointing,This CD is absolutely wretched--except when Bob Winter solos. How a piano geniuslike Bob Winter--one of the great living jazz pianists--can accompany this 3rd ratesinger is beyond me.
4,Open Air Fledermaus,"I have 5 versions of Die Fledermaus, I added this as I am particularly fond of Ute Gfrerer. She does not disapoint as Adele.I was suprised by the outdoor location but it works well. Peter Edelman and Silvana Dussman are adequate as the Von Eisensteins. Paul Armin Edelmen as Dr Falke however has a fine tenor which suits my ears. Artur Stefanowicz as Orlofsky is not quite to my taste, and does not compare with my other versions, the best being Malena Erman, Glyndebourne 2003, both as character and singer. It is not sung in English which is my preference, and the subtitling is good. Frosch the gaoler in his comedy routine was something of a miss, less visual than other versions, and the subtitling did indicate in jokes for the audience, who certainly appreciated him. Overall I would recomend."
1,Very Little 'Pro',"I just browsed the book and found it not very 'pro' related. Hence, does not tackle larger and in depth issues of the pro part of the pro pack to Poser. I do not know of another book. If anyone does know please contact me. Not many color examples. There are only 12 pages of color in a 416 page book. There should be more color where lighting and color are reletive to an image creation software book. There is more information and overlap of Poser 4 issues than the Pro Version.Chad Smith is noted as an Author. His name does not even show up in the credits of the first chapter.I would re-consider purchasing book. I am also thinking about returning it."
1,A Great Book For Illegal Copies Users,"While this book covers the basic of Poser, and some advanced features it does not go past what is offered in manual. In sense I feel it is just a retelling of what was offered for free."
1,Very Little 'Pro',I just browsed the book and found it not very 'pro' related. Not many color examples. There are only 12 pages of color in a 416 page book. There should be more color where lighting and color are reletive to an image creation software book. There is more information and overlap of Poser 4 issues than the Pro Version.I would re-consider purchasing book. I am also thinking about returning it.
5,Another Great Romance with Mystery,"What another great story from this new author. Lord Roland Stathmore ordered to find and capture Lady Kyla Warwick - his one time betrothed. Because of a huge scandal at court, Kyla and her brother Alister had run away to relatives in the highlands of Scotland, and Lord Roland, aptly named the Hound of Hell would do his duty to his soverign and bring them back.Strathmore had never met his betrothed and was not ready for her incredible beauty, and spirit. Temptation and feelings he could not control, led him to gamble his very life in an attempt to save her from the Tower.What follows is a marvelous story of romance, a little bit of magic, quite a good mystery, and an unforgettable love story. What more could you ask for!"
2,Somehow lacking,I was not very impressed with this book at all. I have a couple other books by Ms. Abe but this one was not near as good as the rest. :( I didn't even finish the book. The storyline was all over the place and I didn't really like the couple at all. They didn't seem to fit nor did it seem they should be together.
3,"Sorry, I've read better medieval romances.","Overall the romance was okay. However, the story was completely ruined for me because I couldn't get past the way Lady Kyla was mercilessly hounded like a rabid dog by our hero. King and court were no prize either. Lastly, the surprising revelation at the end was really weak & came out of nowhere."
5,"excellent, highly recommended","This book is an excellent, easy to read book on the subject of ""challenging"" behaviours in people with Autism/PDD. It provides both possible causes and solutions. Co-written by many behaviour therapists & parents and edited by Eric Scholper, it is solidly based, reputable and a wonderful aid for families who are dealing with ""challenging behaviours"". Highly recommended"
5,reader friendly,"Like so many other autism books that may be too technical to understand, this book is easier to relate to. This book gives practical solutions to unexplainable behaviors and gives suggestions in turning negatives into positives.There are many examples from real families. A MUST READ for parents who want to modify certain behaviors of their autistic child."
2,works... but not that well!,"I've had this headset for over a week. Ordered it after seeing so many good reviews about it. Unfortunately, I should have trusted all the complaints by a few users, 'coz they are all true! This headset works, but sure not as good as advertised. My friends on the other end complained about noises, breaking up and that they cannot hear me well. Don't even think about talking in the wind. It does not sit well on my ear either, feels like it is falling off. And it sure doesn't look as cute as in the pic - too big!I bought it through AccessaryOne without noticing their return policy excludes ALL bluetooth headset, and have not being able to reach their customer service, by phone or email. The phone number provided was even out of date. My advise, don't buy it, and not from this seller."
5,Great headset,"I wish they had more than a 5 star rating. Anyone who drives and talks on the phone should definitely get one of these. Voice activated so you never need to take your eyes off the road. Great for walking, too! Make sure your cellular phone is blue tooth capatible - most of them are now."
2,Nice headset.... while it lasted :-(,"Had this headset for 3 months. Worked pretty well, nice sound volume and people didn't complain about not being able to hear me. I was pretty happy with it overall until today, when the speaker fell off the body of the headset. Both wires separated from the main body (the adhesive failed, then the wires came un-soldered).I had a couple of small complaints prior to the unit failing. The unit hurt my ear after a couple of hours of wear. It would randomly lose the bluetooth connection to the phone, and was kind of a pain to set back up.I won't be buying another Cardo Scala product."
4,Works great. Great sound,"I have the Scala 500. I have had it since last July. People I talk to say it sounds better then when I use the actual phone by itself. No one has ever said ""What did you say?"" The button started to act up. So I called Cardo. I sent it in and received the new one in about a week. The only problem is it drops the connection some times, while in stand by. I have not had it drop an actual call."
2,Not Consistent,Some times the person on the other end hears crystal clear other times person says it sound like you are in a empty room on speaker phone with kind of a echo.
4,Cardo works great,"I got word of this device when I noticed it was bundled with a BT keyboard offered by Nextel. I didn't want the promotion, but I did want the headset, so I did a little research and discovered that many users were rating the Cardo scala over much better known devices. They were right. This headset works fine and it is half to a third of the price of other brands. The only drawback (and I have no point of comparison since the Cardo is the only BT headset I've used) is that the unit will lose connection with the Blackberry often. It isn't hard to reconnect, but it is annoying because you can't tell that it became disconnected. I recommend it."
2,Bad connection,"Have tried the scala500, Jabra800, Moto850. The Jabra was the best followed by the Moto then the scala.The scala just had too much static and poor audio quality. It fit the best and was very light, but the sound was bad and the other side said I sounded horrible. My wife refused to talk to me while I had it on. It linked easily to my phone and did everything right except work."
2,"Cheap, YES. Overall quality, POOR","I've bought this earpiece after I've read a review stating it was the best match to TREO 650 which I own (This one, YES it is a great device).Ergonomics is poor and it feels like it will fall from your ear all the time.The voice quality was really poor. Noise on the reception and people hearing me would complaint of low level and noise as well.It only lasted for two weeks because although the belt clip is small and cute it did not hold it and before I knew it was gone."
4,Works pretty well with the Treo 650,"I think this headset works well. There are times in the car that the volume could be a bit louder, but there are times when it is too loud (strange).My only real complaint is there is static sometimes (that only I can here), but from what I have read, this is a function of the weak bluetooth signal from the Treo rather than the headset itself. Oddly enough, it isn't consistant."
2,poor sound quality,"The sound quality of the Scala 500 is too poor for use in a business environment. Customers could not hear me on several occasions and the headset volume was too low for use in noisy environments like a car. In general, the sync process of bluetooth is quite a burden. It takes about 20 seconds -- this means that you can't sync it when needed, but must leave it on at all times if you wish to use it on incomming calls. Until I can find a bluetooth headset of comparable quality I have gone back to a $11 hardwired headset that I purchased at my local convience store."
4,"Great, but one problem...","I thought the BT headset worked GREAT! And I tried so hard to keep it, but the earpiece part that went in the ear came off so easily that is showed the wires off. I thought it was a defect and it might have been, so I ordered another replacement, it came two days later...was pumped about that, but then the same thing happend. Great headset, but the defect was in the piece that stuck in the ear. Love the lanyard, the holster, the feel and the look, but didn't work. I did some research and it seems like there are a couple different versions of the Scala 500, one with the cradle for charging and one without, I bought the one without and it had the mesh earpiece that came off...I think the one with the cradle has a more secure ear insert, so I am in the middle of purchasing that one (it's black). Good luck!"
2,"Good item, didn't work for me.","Let me begin this review by stating that a lot of people have used this device quite successfully. As for me, there were two main problems. First, I found the sound level to be too low. While it's easy enough to turn up the volume, the problem lies in the microphone being so close that it causes a major echo for the person on the other end. The second problem I had was that I was never able to transfer a call from the device to the phone. I tried to use this model for a couple weeks just to make sure but, after that time, I decided to send it back and keep looking."
2,"May be it works, BUT NOT for me...","Influenced by all those nice reviews and the price I decided to get me one of those. Pairing with my Samsung SGH-D600 was a breaze, I adjusted the earhook to fit perfectly on my ear (no wabling). The design is nice and compact.What comes to performance, there I was disappointed.I could hear people on the other side without any problems, the sound is pretty good, but people could not hear me, they heard pieces of what I was saying.It was practically impossible to have a conversation because people kept asking me to repeat myself.Sometimes it dropped connection with my phone, which is really inconvinient when driving.May be I had a faulty unit or it was not compatible with my phone, which I doubt, but I would not get this headset again.Thanks for reading."
3,Easy to use,"I gave this 3 stars when comparing it to every other bluetooth headset. For someone looking to spend less than $50 I'd say this is a 4 1/2 star purchase.I did have people complain of an echo when talking to me. I had the volume up somewhat loud and they could hear themselves. That could be solved by Cardo putting an earbud on the speaker to channel the sound into your ear rather than broadcasting it.Also I did lose the dang thing not too long after I received it. First time buyers, be careful whatever headset you buy. You won't believe how easy it is to lose these things."
4,Scala is great,"This was my first Bluetooth, however it was recommended by friends. The sound is great, and people are suprised they dont hear all of the wind they normally hear from other headsets."
1,Cardio Scala 500,"I received my first Scala and used it for 1 week and the earpiece fell off. So I returned it to Amazon, who sent me a new one in return, and after using it for 2 days, the earpiece fell off of that one.I will be returning the second one this week for a refund not an exchange."
2,Not worth it!,"I bought this earpiece about 5 months ago. Contrary to some positive reviews I read online, I am not happy with it. The volume is WAY too low (I often find that I'm literally trying to stuff the earpiece into my ear to actually hear anything) and the wireless connection is not strong at all (you will begin to hear large amounts of static when the phone is as little as two feet away). Look elsewhere, that's what I'm doing now . . ."
2,"Wind Guard, What Wind Guard.","PRO:Cheap.Con:Bad Audio Quality.if you are using it in your right ear, you will need to place the phone in your right pocket.WindGuard Technology is marketing crap, the headset does not work at all in any kind of wind."
4,First impressions,"It works well, sound is clearIt is very sensitive, due to it's size - I've accidently turned it off when trying to make minor adjustments or position it on my head.All in all - satisfied."
2,Hard to find a good bluetooth headset,"Great product if you like the extras. But from a technical standpoint, the sound quality is below par. A lot of static."
1,Junk,"Earpeice breaks off so easily, mine was broke within 5 minutes of use. This headset lasted me about a week before it hit the trash can."
3,"Mine is missing the thing for the earpiece, too.","My package didn't include the thing for the earpiece, either, even though it is referred to in the manual. Curious.Re how it works, it's so-so. I haven't decided whether or not to keep it or not. It flops around some, and there is quite a bit of static. I'm not completely happy with it."
1,Poor quality/design with speaker,The speaker for your ear is uncomfortable and poorly designed. The speaker on my headset broke after 3 months. Will not buy another Cardo headset.
1,Broken,One of the headsets is broken. I returned the headset by mail and they claim they did not receive it.
1,over rated,"this is a good bluetooth headset, but it doesn't come with all that it says it does. there is no charging dock.....one main reason that i went with this one. so im very disappointed."
3,Cardo Systems SCALA 500 Bluetooth Headset,"I was forced to return this item directly to cardo because of a defective battery. I purchased this headset because of two prior headsets I had from them which served my faithfully until I dropped one in water and lost the other one. This one works quite well. BTW, I have also found the one I lost, so now I have two! As to the cost, the shipping was expensive, but the unit was well priced."
5,Great Product,"This Cardo headset is awesome. Quality is great, easy to pair, and really stands up to the use. Would highly recommend this item or any of the Cardo Scala bluetooth headsets to anyone looking for a bluetooth headset."
1,Cardo Systems Scala 500,The headset I received was apparently defective. The sound quality on my end was excellent but everyone I talked to said it sounded like I was in a tunnel. The car charger did not work at all. I returned the set for a full refund.
2,Cardo Systems SCALA 500 Bluetooth Headset,"This headset worked great the first week, but the plastic piece around the speaker kept falling off and eventually lost. Once it was lost the earpiece that goes to your ear moves too much and now it is all in the garbage cause the speaker has fallen off and all less then a month old."
3,DOES NOT FIT on small ears. windproof faulty,"good headset but windproof technology is not the greatest, still produces static and the set doesn't fit on my girlfriends ear. her the size of her ear frame seems to be too small. i was able to shape it to fit her ear, but the earpiece would get misaligned with her ear."
2,Sorry to say...,"I read so many good reviews even though there were several bad reviews mentioning the sound piece detaching and no ability to mold the earpiece to fit the ear. Well... I found the sound piece detached and there is no way to fit the headpiece to a smaller ear. It was very compact and lightweight, but didn't work."
1,Cardo Systems scala-500 Bluetooth Headset does not live up to expectations,"I specifically ordered this headset because of the eye glass clip. When I received the order, the clip would not fit on my glasses, and appeared to be of extreme poor contstruction (the type you would expect out of a Craker Jack box).The headset would required pressing the button to answer a call several times before it would actually pick up the call.The product is in the process of being returned to Amazon.com."
3,Ouch,"Let me preface this review by saying that I am a heavy user of phone headsets and have certain expectations for sound quality, comfort, etc.I bought the Scala for my wife and she could use it due to an uncomfortable fit. Now that she's rejected it, I've been trying to use it instead of my standard phone headset.I have to admit that my wife is right - this thing can hurt your ear if you keep it on for more than 15 minutes. Furthermore: it is not loud enough to use in the car at highway speeds (my car is not the quietest, but still...), bluetooth reception with my blackberry 7100t is fair (works well only if I can keep the top of the phone pointed towards the Scala). also, the microphone picks up too much external noise - people complain when I call them from an airport or other loud area.My normal headset is the etycom, which is spectaclar (if a bit uncomfortable). Still, I like the idea of going wireless, so I just ordered the logitech bluetooth headset."
5,My first Bluetooth experience has been great,"Other reviews of Jabra and Bodyglove products led me to this unit. It includes averything needed to get running. The options for carrying the unit are what finally sold me as it includes a neck lanyard, eyeglasses clip, clip on holster and ear hook. I use the earhook and find it comfortable enough that I forget it is on.The only complaints are the blue LED that blinks when the unit is on (I get BORG coments from my geeky freinds, and it is unnecessarily flashy) and that there is no car charger.I have only been using it for a couple of weeks, so cannot verify it's durability. I can say that the sound is great, people on the other end say it is very clear and the price was great. I am now looking for a speakerphone option."
2,Very Poor Battery Life,"I only can use my unit for about 1 hour per day. 1/2 hour on standby and 1/2 hour in use and it has to be recharged. Also, it has to be close to the phone. No farther away than a pocket.It does work well when the battery is fresh but I would not buy another one."
5,Cardo Systems Scala-500 Bluetooth Headset - silver,"I am very happy with this headset. It works as well as it says it does. I have a Treo phone and the Treo Bluetooth that I got for it doesn't even compare to the Cardo. It is clear, has good range, and has been an awesome purchase. It stays in place comfortably, or can be clipped to a belt or worn on a lanyard w/holster. I would definately buy it again!!--and I would recommend it highly to anyone looking for a good headset!!"
2,Great but it stopped working after a month!!,The charger just wouldn't charge the headset anymore. Great product till i was able to use it but then no point if the product doesn't work. I bought my new Motorola HS820 for the SAME price!! Don't fall for this.
2,Just okay.....No Craddle,This is my first bluetooth Headset. I am not sure if this is the way the bluetooth headsets perform but I am highly disappointed with this one. Lot of disturbance with frequent voice breaks. Talked to couple of friends using the Headset and all have same complain 'You Voice is Breaking'. I put it aside and started to talk directly from my cell and it was okay. So..it's the Headset.I took it because I would be on Road every wnd in summers but performance is really bad while driving. The ear loop is not well designed and Doesn't fits properly.If this is normal with other Bluetooth Headset then okay otherwise would not advice it.Returning Mine.
1,Domme Vixen-toys,I purchased this awhile back and it worked all of two months. I was not pleased with the product because it didn't stand to the hype it promoted.
3,scala 500 bluetooth,"I bought my headset about a month ago,it works ok,but I'm not sure if I would buy another one.It took them about ten days to get my mic. cover.I just received it today so I'm not sure if it will help or not.When I'm in the car and call my son he says he can hear backround noise,but you might get that with any headset.I don't have another one to compair it with so I would say thatit's ok ,and it's better than not having one."
4,Buena compra,Es una buena compra pero el sonido no es de la mejor calidad. Lo uso con un Sony T610 y con mi powerbook G4 (para llamar via skype por ejemplo).
1,VERY disappointed...,"First of all, I now know why the shipping is free over a certain amount of dollars spent. It took FOREVER to receive my Cardo Systems scala-500 Bluetooth Headset and we remain waiting for a DVD we order WEEKS ago. I'm not sure if the fulfillment of the order is on the manufacturer's end or Amazon.com's end. ANYWAY, when the produce FINALLY arrived, we opened the box and did everything right according to the instructions/manual. Here in-lies the problem(s): the earpiece hurt, the unit turns its self off and on, it picks up other cell phones and tries to pair with them (the cars next to me), several calls were staticy and/or sounded as if the other end was underwater, the main function button is HUGE on the face (which is pressed accidentally, all the time) and places your call on hold or hangs up, the battery life was no where's near what is advertised, etc. We gave it a chance for 2 days and could no longer take it! It's going back first thing Monday morning!"
1,Dr. Tom Howe,Do not waste your money on this junk. It did not work from the first day. The eyeglass connector is flimsy and does not work on all sunglasses. I recommend that you look somewhere else for a headset that actually works.
2,You get what you pay for,Bought the Scala on the recommendation of a friend at work. He absolutely loves it with his RAZR. I liked the reviews the and the price.Got my Scala and it paired easily with my Moto E815. Plastic ear piece housing came off within 10 minutes and back to Amazon it went. Somebody at the factory skimping on the glue.
4,Excellent Choice,"Very satisifed with this headset. Small, unobtrusive form factor, good sound quality, pairs easily with phone.Took 1 star off for cheesy accessories (but who needs 'em anyway)."
1,Worst Bluetooth Headset I have Tried,"I have tried several Bluetooth headsets to find the best one. In my opinion, this one is bar far the worst yet. Very poor sound, extremely staticy and broken up call sounds. It was pretty much unusable. I immediately returned it."
3,Pros and Cons,"This performs as advertised, but I have two reservations now. One with the product and one with the technology.1) The product: The pairing key is the first of the three generics used by most bluetooth vendors and appears to be unchangable. This is a security risk as hacks are already in the wild for this.2) The Technology: If you leave bluetooth on and receive a call you have to answer using the headsets. Most phones don't allow you to switch back to hands-on use with the phone once a call is coming in. This means answer the phone and fumble with the head set or fumble with the headset and hope you get it on before the call goes to v-mail."
4,What I was after.,"It's wireless and it works, that's what I was after! Sound is good, volume is good. It makes a little extra noise that's annoying, and I have to adjust it frequently to keep it on my ear.Other than that, a great little gizmo."
3,Better than Motorola but still not that good,"Compared to Motorola Bluetooth headsets, this Cardo really rocks. It has much better mic and speaker sound quality and volume than Motorola. The Motorola makes me sound like I'm talking on a speakerphone while the Cardo is a bit better in this regard.That said, because the mic is so far away from your mouth, you will still sound very distant and a bit muffled. With this Cardo, callers still complain when I'm in the car or outside on a windy day that there is a lot of background wind noise.I ended up going back to the wired headset that came with my Motorola RAZR phone, which has much better audio quality and is not as cumbersome to setup during a call as a Bluetooth headset."
3,"Got it free with my TREO 650, it did OK....","Your phone will ring in your ear at quite some distance, but to actually connect and talk to someone using the headset remotely, you needed to be within 10-15 feet of the phone.To avoid too much static, you really needed to be within 5-10 feet of your phone. But even if you had the ohone in your hand/holster, there was some static.The volume was OK, I bought volumecontrol software to boost the volume, but it made it scratchier. The speaker is just too tinny. I am hard of hearing though, so no fair there.Comfort. OK. After about 20 minutes you notice it, then you forget about it, and you take it off 2 hours later and your ear hurts a bit. Normal I guess.Battery time was gerat, both talk and standby.Pairing was easy with my treo.good charging connection (stem plug) and quick charging.It's good for the price, but I think you can do better. I am looking at the Plantronics Voyager 510."
1,Total waste of time and money,"I recieve the Cardo Systems scala-500 Bluetooth Headset . But I had a problem when I open de box, the plastic ear piece housing was out and the speaker was detach from the 2 wires in the main unit. I read the reviews and this is a very common problem with this product,I thought it was a minor one and won't happen to me, but it did. I was not able to try out how it work because it was broken.Please if you don't want to waste your time and money don't even consider to buy this headset, don't do what I did."
4,Scala 500,"Pretty good headset, sometimes hard to fit on the ear, very nice quality, but it always preset the volume to mid volume (I always like max. volume) Loud and clear..."
3,"Cardo ok, but shop around","This headset is okay, the volume in it is low at times. It has a great range. The accesories are nice, you can barely feelit on your ear. I just wish it worked with my voice dialer on my phone"
4,Get what you pay for,"The headset does an average job working with my treo 650. Sound is decent and it is easy to use. However after owning the product for less then a day I notice the ear piece was broken. I had to superglue it. I should not have been surprised because the box that the headset came in looked as though it was used to paly kickball with, while the shipping box was not damaged at all. I assume my product was a return that was reshipped. Otherwise it is worth the money which is minimal."
5,Don't believe me...,"Try it for yourself. I have gone through 4 Bluetooth headsets and FINALLY this one has it all. Awesome sound, great price, quick pairing, light weight, your ear doesn't hurt, no static or crackling, people think you're on a chorded landline it sounds so good, and well again for the price it can't be beat!!!FYI i also have a Plantronic 320 & 590 and a G-Life. I would NOT recommend the 320 Plantronical at all cause the volume sucks, the ear configuration hurts, and cracks and pops. The 590 pairing sucks but the wireless headphone ability rocks. The G-Life doesn't hold a charge and is the old school bluetooth technology."
2,Not the greatest headset,"I have tried three headsets so far with my Treo 650 and they have all been bad. One I could hear great, but everyone said it sounded like I was muffled, the other I sounded great, but couldn't hear anyone, and then this one - the Scala 500. It is the worst of the bunch. If my phone is more than 2 feet away from the headset, I get static. People on the other end cant hear me especially if I am outside. This is supposed to have ""WindGuard Technology"" on it. Well folks, it doesn't work. A slight breeze makes my conversation unintelligible. The ear piece doesnt fit ""inside"" your ear. It sort of hangs on the outside so in a noisy environment you can forget it.It is nice and light, and does come with cool options, but for the things you need a headset for, it falls short.I am looking for a decent headset, but not finding one and this one certainly isnt it."
4,SCALA 500 Bluetooth Headset,I am very pleased with this headset. It is very comfortable and the sound is good. People on the other end state that it sounds a little hollow but they can hear me very clearly. I don't think you will find a better value.
1,Junk,After charging the unit and playing with it for three days it was thrown away. Every time I pushed the button to answer a call or make a call I got different results. I had to heat the ear piece to get the mic pointed down out of the sky.Range from phone was under 10 feet before the static took over.Waste of dollars spent.Pure junk
3,Not great,"Other reviews said this is the loudest headset out there. Not mine as I often have to keep pressing the unit to my head to hear well. That said the fit is not great as the earpiece often feels like it is falling off my head, and does. It links up to my BlackBerry 7105 just great. I will look elsewhere for my next unit."
2,Fell apart in 4 months,"I got this bluetooth headset based on reviews and the price, but found I had to install VolumeCare software to up the volume. Then it worked OK for about four months but recently the little round speaker broke off just from being in a shirt pocket and tangling with a ballpoint pen! I soldered and glued the speaker back into position and it works in a rather tinny way now, but I will have to replace this unit. I now feel the adage holds true: you get what you pay for!"
2,Much Better Products Out There,I am returning this for a partial refund after a little over a month. Volume on the speaker is low - people have trouble hearing me even with volume on max. There have to be better products out there than this.
2,Very cheap construction,"I purchased the Scala 500 as my first BT headset and I regret it. The company is v-e-r-y slow to respond to email messages to their support box, so call them, don't write.While the sound quality of the unit is very, very good, there are other issues with the unit. First, the fit on my particular ear is horrible... always feeling like it was going to fall off. I never trusted it walking through airports as it just didn't feel secure.Second, the unit literally fell apart in my hands after three or four months. The portion that protrudes gently into my ear came loose, then broke off. I note that others have metioned the same thing. It just wasn't well constructed. Bummer! I've replaced it now with another low-cost unit made by Plantronics, but while I miss the sound quality of the Cardo, I am disappointed by their slow support and poor quality."
2,Not recommended.,This product works properly except it doesn't provide a secure fit around my ear. It dangles with the slightest head movement.
1,Didnt work with my Moto V600,"I recently bought this headset after reading all the great reviews. The packaging and the headset looks good but the sound quality is pathetic. The other caller had trouble listening to me and I was unable to hear him. Everytime I move my head or move around there is a lot of Static. The range of this device is more like 5-6 feet, it wouldnt work after that, I tested it by connecting to my laptop through BT and the results were same. I think that BT technology has got a long way to go before its ready for consumers."
1,False Advertising and no help from Amazon,"Be aware that when you buy this you aren't going to get the car charger. I did receive the headset but couldn't figure out why the charger didn't come in the mail as promised. Spent 60 minutes on hold with Tiger Direct who shipped the product. Thats right 60 minutes broken into (3) 20 min calls. Never a real person to talk to. 2 emails ontop of that and still no answer from Tiger Direct. So you would think that Amazon would be some help. Nope they were quick to have ""hands off its not our fault"". You would think they would at LEAST remove this item from their website because of the false advertising.The product is so-so, your getting about what you paid for. Was most interested in the car charger portion and now don't even have that. Stuck with the headset because guess what, thats right, without talking to somone from Tiger Direct you can't even return the item.Buyer beware on this one. As for Amazon they lost a big customer in me....."
2,"I love the Scala, but it's durability is questionable","I purchased the Scala 500 less than 2 months ago here at amazon and the device fell apart 2 weeks ago (i.e, less than a month of usage.I LOVE the product because of the ease of use, clarity and general simplicity of the pairing process. However, I was very disappointed that it distegrated after such a short while.On the upside, I called Cardo and they had me return the broken headset and they just sent me a new one. I would have liked to be reimbursed for shipping costs....All in all, this headset is great when it comes to ease of use and sound quality. Only downside is that, it's durability is questionable."
4,Scala 500,"I now have 5 of these, they work very well, I have given them to friends and all tell me they have enjoyed them very much. Amazon was prompted in delivery, and they were good with one that had to be returned for replacement, so I am pleased and will make purchases with they in the furture."
4,Great BT Headset,Well...I replaced a Plantronics Voyager 510 with this. The Scala 500 had proven itself to me before with previous phones but I wanted to try the 510. I like the 510 better but it just wouldn't stay connected to my Motorola Q. I went thru 3 510's before I had enough and bought the Scala 500. The Scala works flawlessly with the Q. The only reason I won't give it a 5 is that it is a bit uncomfortable after a long period of time on my ear and the sound quality is a little grainy in my ear other than that it is perfect - buy one and you will not be disappointed. It has a great windscreen on it too.
3,good for the price,this is my first BT headset. basically it worked. it often would have static if not within 2 or 3 feet of my phone (treo 650)2 annoying things:1) The blinking blue light is way too bright. (this light is on when the headest is on) any blinking light is a bad idea. ugly and distracting in a dark room.2) to turn this headset on and off you need to hold the button down for @5 sec. why can't there be a simple switch? i would sometimes want to turn it on in a hurry when a call came in. it often would not turn off but would go into discovery mode (?) and i'd have to hold the button down a second time for 5 or so sec. that got very annoying.
1,Worst headset I ever used. Stay away!!,Cons- Poor range- Difficult to pair with my Sony or Motorola phone- Uncomfortable- Static SoundPros- It's cheap.I returned mine the next day and bought a Motorola 810. It's so much better all around.
1,not received,"I have not received the Cardo earpiece I ordered on June 29, so I cannot rate it. Amazon has billed me for it, however!"
2,Unacceptable,"Sure, it does what it says it will, i.e. function as a cordless headset for your bluetooth phone, but it also manages to make the wearer look like a complete tool while wearing it. But hey, if you spend much time at star trek conventions, you will certainly find yourself the talk of the town. Good luck with that."
1,would not reccommend for treo 650,"i would not purchase this product if you have a treo 650. the divece constantly breaks up. it must be within inches. far below what was expected. had to return. may have been defective, but not willing to try another."
3,"Great quality, battery life, and sound, not so great integration with phone.",I purchase the Scala after my Jabra first generation BT headset broke. The battery life was way better than my Jabra and I didn't have to bother with sticking an earbud in my ear canal.My only problem with the scala is that it does not work as good with my Sony T616 as the Jabra. I often miss calls because the scala was slow to connect to the phone when re-establishing a connection.
2,Biotin Shampoo ?,"I purchased this shampoo with the recommendation of someone who uses Biotin shampoo all the time with much satisfaction, but I am unhappy with this particular brand because it is too watery and I need much more of the product to get a good clean feel. It seems that I always have to wash my hair twice and on the second shampoo it will lather up like most shampoos do on only one wash. Will try another brand next time.I did write to the manufacturer per above."
2,not impressed,I was hoping for better results from this product. I don't feel like it makes my hair stronger nor does it help with thinning hair. I feel like I have to use a lot more of this shampoo just to get a good lather. I will not buy this again.
3,Bittersweet,"This is a good product if you just want a clean rinse and a natural product. It works a bit like the Wen system does but with slightly less conditioning, and it's also way cheaper. (it smells a bit like Wen, too)I began using it for its claim to protect thin hair/hair loss. If you want something for this reason, you might be better off looking elsewhere. It didn't reduce any shedding or hair loss, but it didn't increase it either. It just acted like any other shampoo for thin hair.I like this product as a natural option for shampoo, but don't expect a miracle. It's just a nice shampoo."
4,Saturday at the movies,"I first saw this movie when I was 12. It frightened the heck out of me then, and it still does. The crabs are the ultimate atomic mutants, even better than the ants in ""Them"" or the hokey spider in ""Tarantula."" See it with someone you love or, even better, with a take-out order of snow crab legs."
2,Disappointing DVD,"""Attack of the Crab Monsters"" was a popular television staple back in the 1960s. In the last 40 years the film has been rarely shown, especially when the (now defunct) Allied Artists' television syndication packages expired. This example of Roger Corman's low budget inventiveness is often remembered with a feeling of nostalgia. Unfortunately, the Apex DVD has some of the worst image quality I've ever seen on DVD. The DVD contains Allied Artist's U.S. television version, which was padded to 70 minutes, which looks like is was copied from a poor quality public domain videocassete which was mastered from a well used 16mm print."
2,You get what you pay for,"I have purchased stuff from Amazon for a long time now and this is the first time I have been disappointed at anything I have purchased from them. While ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTERS is a very good movie in and of itself, the quality of this DVD was just so poor, it was virtually unwatchable, first of all, there was no menu to speak of, the menu that was there looks like it was done off a computer and the quality of the movie itself looked like something out of a second generation copy of an original video tape (a copy of a copy). too bright in some spots, too dark in others, I'm glad I only spent 11.99 for it or I'd be pissed, the two stars I gave it were for the time I gave to give this review. See my review on the Movies Unlimited Version.........Sorry Amazon, you dropped the ball on this one."
2,Cheap bootleg,"Yes, this is the classic B&W Sci/Fi from Roger Corman and No, the quality isn't any good. Like one reviewer stated, this movie was obviously burnt from the old, out of print VHS version in someone's basement. You'll know it's a bootleg as soon as you see the cover and the dvd menu. It was good to see the movie again from ages ago but, your better off trying to rent it through Nexflix or something. The quality is horrible."
1,WASTE OF TIME,This DVD appears to have been copied from a VHS tape. The recording quality is horrendous. Almost unwatchable. Please stay clear.
2,Sound Track Hiss,"Great 50s sci-fi, but my tape has a soundtrack hiss that's totally distracting. Ruined the film for me, and I'm considering returning the tape."
1,Reconsider purchasing this version...,"I received the copy of this VHS in the black box with a video release date of 1-1-85. Please be advised that this copy is way less than standard. Although it is recorded in SP mode, it is an absolutle horrible copy. Picture is too bright and it jitters and even rolls at spots. I have seen better bootleg copies of this film. This is the type of tape you'd expect to find in a bargin bin for 4.99. I can't believe they're asking 14.95 for such a poor copy. Wait for the DVD..."
1,Attack of the Crab Monsters,I'm a big fan of the 50's monster movies. A test blast of the atomic bomb mutated the crabs into giant size. The first research party to study the island disapeared so they send in a second research party. Need I say more? I looked forward to watching this movie because it was my favorite as a kid. I just ordered this and was very disapointed with quality of this video. It was the worst quality video I have ever purchased. It looked like they copied off a TV that was on the runway of a large airport. The entire movie was fuzzy and a few times the whole picture was blanked out. Very disapointing. ...
1,Uhg!,"Drab movie with early attempts at sensationalism. Entertaining, but does not make too much sense as the plot line is convoluted."
4,Attack of the Crab Monsters,It's fun if you just want to watch an old time monster movie. It was campy and followed the old sci-fi formula. You always know who is the next victim. My son had seen it when he was about 3 yrs. old and it really scared him. Watching it in his 40's was a kick for him.
3,Attack of the Crab Monsters,"it wasn't so bad, a typic al 50's sci-fi movie-the quality wasn't great, but it was watchable. it was just about what i expected"
3,DVD quality,"A comment on the DVD quality - I haven't seen the DVD yet and so can't really review it's quality but the rumor going around on other web site sources is that the quality isn't very good so, do your homework. Until I hear differently, I'll assume that the quality is below average - a shame, since I've wanted this one on DVD for a while and it is worth it's weight (well, more) in amusement value. I'm giving it an average 'review' (as a warning) but again, haven't seen it."
2,"great concept, average writing","This book sends a wonderful message describing the importance of gracefully receiving for those of us who feel guilty receiving gifts, relaxing, or taking a break from life. It helps the reader understand the psychology of giving too much and reciving too little. This is a great framework, but the writing is average or below. It is distractingly oversimplified and repetitive. I have to restrain myself from editing it as I read."
2,bleh,"I was looking for a book about how to surrender to the Universe, this book isn't it. It's about one woman's challenges. If you are a control freak who can't receive a gift without feeling like you need to reciprocate immediately, perhaps this book is for you. I don't think it applies to most people though."
2,Trite,"A friend recommended this book to me, saying that men too could benefit from reading it.Wrong (in my opinion). I didn't get very far into this book, for the simple reason that there's nothing new here. It's trite and unoriginal; a copy of a copy of a copy of every self-help book you've ever read."
5,Fabulous book!,I am thrilled that this book is still available. A co-worker recommended it and I am having a great time working through the best recipes of my three favorite types of foods.
5,Worked great!,"This kit worked great. looks great in my xterra. Another feedback mentioned he had to cut something to get it to fit. I think he was talking about a metal bracket on the right side that prevents the screw holes from lining up and proper installation. I had to use a grinder to file down the metal also and its not bad if you are mechanically inclined at all. The metal would effect any kit, not just this one. This would most likely need to be done for any aftermarket stereo. It only took me about a minute to grind it down... its about 1/8th inch X 3inches on the right side, you cant miss it. All you gotta do is carefully grind it down flush with the plastic to make the kit fit."
5,"Smooth, pure voice.",I listen to this c.d. over and over. I love it! Buy this now before it's too late.
3,"Good fun, while it lasted","good design, good for biggeners like myself to experiance something they can crash and simply distroy before joining to big boys with the more expensive choppers...my first crash took part of my blade, which made it a bit unstable..my 2nd crash took half of my lower blade, which made the chopper not fly as high...charging takes 1 hour, lasts under 10 minutes!it goes up, down, left and right! and thats it! its a 2CH, something i was not aware of when I purchased this, so if you want something better, get the same model only a 4CH one, then you get the forward and reverse controls as well!the best thing about this model is the body, it looks fantastic...go for this if its your 1st ever chopper... and GET TRAINIG GEAR to avoide destroying your blades!!"
1,NO ES LO QUE ANUNCIAN,"Compre este helicptero desde Mexico, pero no es el que anunciaron, me llego otro tipo de helicptero de mucho menor calidad, sin manual, les recomiendo a los señores de Amazon que vendan lo que anuncian."
3,"Fragile, forgot about control","ok it looks amazing, best looking copter for the price, charge time about 3 hours for less than 10 minutes of play time. You have left/right, up/downThe left and right control the tail so its hard to get used to thatu assume left will make it go left but if you keep pressing left or right the copter just spins in circlesThe up and down does what its supposed to do, the thing doesn't move forward and backward, I guess it goes were the wind takes it, pretty undpredictable, you have to follow it around.You will crash this copter, the blades are fragile and break easily compared to other similarly priced models, also the copter has wheels on the bottom wich also break easily when you attempt to land it.I recomend the SYMA HX603 RADIO CONTROLLED HELICOPTER, it is similarly priced and not as fragile as this model."
1,Not recommended,"I purchased this as a gift for my brother. Maybe it's because it's for people who already know how to fly rc helis, but we broke it on the first try. It was very difficult to control and the helicopter did not come with any instructions. I wish I had gotten him something else for christmas."
3,Good Customer Service,"My parents actually purchased this helicopter for my son for Christmas. The first one did not fly correctly due to damage during shipping, the company sent a replacement right away & without hesitation. The helicopter instructions are a bit complicated, so it definately needs to be monitored by an adult."
5,One of the best ever records...ever,"I've been listening to this album for over 25 years. At a tender age my brother and sister-in-law let me have their copy of this album (the American version spoken of in a previous review) and I've enjoyed it ever since.You won't believe this is the same group that sings ""Carrie-Anne"" and ""Bus Stop"". This album has depth, great songwriting, and Graham Nash's outstanding ""Tell Me To My Face"".Other outstanding tracks are ""High Classed"", ""Peculiar Situation"", and, well, the whole album! It's all good.I really appreciate the mono/stereo presentation. The stereo songs have a bit more audio depth than the mono.What are you waiting for? Buy this album! Now! It's better than the typical 1960's stuff.Did I mention ""Tell Me to My Face""?"
4,That's got to be Billy Mundi on drums cut 1 at least,"elsewhere I've seen him credited, and he was certainly involved with those musicians/lived Woodstock area. For my $, said cut 1 SONG OF THE ELVES is pop-production-craftmanship perfection, just psychedelic enough with those Leslied vocals: which quality [and effect] I tend to miss through the rest of the record, though others like my fellow commentators with jazzier tastes may be plenty justified in their enthusiasm"
3,"Good Content, Poor Editing","The content of this book was very interesting and thought provoking. There were several parts I highlighted because they resonated with me. While the food advice section was nothing new to me, I bought and read this book more for the explanation of why people overeat and while I would have liked the book to be longer, I felt I got what I wanted in that regard. However, the editing was horrible. There seemed to be a misspelling every other line. Some words were so misspelled I couldn't even tell what the original word was. They made the book very hard to read and brought it down several notches in my rating. I recommend this book for the content but only if you feel up to deciphering the misspellings."
1,Piece of Junk,"As the first reveiwer stated this is a crew, not a hoodie. The sizing is so small that it should be a child's/junior sizing. I bought an extra large and it is more like a women's small or medium. The fabric is super cheap and seems like it would shrink a great deal when washed. Junk."
1,Another book to donate to Goodwill,"I was quite excited to read this book.By the end of chapter one however, it became clear EXACTLY what this characters agenda was, and I should have known better.Written by a member of the ""Worlds most PEACEFUL Religion"", it just boggles the mind how people can actually believe this trash.But then again the AUTHOR was a communist who then embraced ISLAM and suddenly went on a Jew Hating binge.A great book for anti-semites and the rest of the trash that collaborates with them.ALLAHU AKBAR and all that jazz."
2,Idiot for buying this book,"I do application development but not computer illustration. I wanted something simple to learn some basic functionality and the premise that the author used a step-be-step approach to create a comic strip was appealing. Unfortunately, his instructions don't often times work. Little items that he skips causes great frustration. This may be better than nothing but not by much."
5,Glad to be an idiot.,"Fabulous way of writing so folks with most any level of computer comprehension will understand illustration, and have a blast learning.Am waiting for the 2004 version."
2,Bleh,"Strung Out On OK Computer worked because Ok Computer had many transitions musically which complimented a string quartet. This, however, is Kid A. And Kid A is obviously slower, less complex, and subtle, which just doesn't work for this formet. Buy Strung Out On OK Computer instead--this is just taking things too far for the $$$$."
2,Do not buy if you want Romance!,"I love Thea Devine's erotic romances. And yes although all her work is labled as romance, sometimes the romance doesn't entirley come in her books until the last 2 pages. Up until this book, the erotically charged romances she has created was absolutley wonderful. However, this book was just full of erotica with no wonderful ending in site. No, ""I love you's"", and no other sweet mushy endings us romance readers often enjoy. I love my books with lots of erotically charged sex and then the wonderful endings, this book only has the sex. It's still a Devine book, so if you are truly a fan , don't cull it. Just understand going in that the Romance is sketchy at best."
2,too many typos,"I bought it as a gift for a high school student that is having some problems with his spanish lessons. I cannot give it to him because there are too many typos in the spanish side. In the english side it is ok, although some meanings of the proverbs doesn't match its original meaning in spanish. For english spoken students this book is not recommendable, it will confuse them about the spanish grammar and writing. For spanish spoken students this book is ok. It's a shame this book didn't went through a spanish revision. Hope in the next edition they can fix all the typos that makes this book a poor quality edition product."
5,A Spelling Dictionary for Our Time,"Most of the spelling dictionaries I've bought are limited to 20, 40, or 50 thousand words. Considering the ongoing growth in English vocabulary a dictionary of larger capacity has been overdue. At last Oxford press has put out one appropriate to the 21st centuary. As a reference book for writing, it is an excellent choice."
1,The Travel Video Guaranteed to Cure Insomnia,"As one who lived for two years in Italy, and travelled several times to Venice, I only purchased this video to persuade a reluctant travel companion to spend prescious vacation days in Venice, the city of both romance and unique visionary sites. Unfortunately, this out-dated, poorly shot video was monotonous, and anything but inspiring for the potential Venice visitor. Rather than encouraging the casual visitor, it merely convinces one that there are more interesting places to visit on this earth. It was painful watching the majority of this video, and I only achieved completion by reminding myself that I had squandered my money on this drivel. I advise anyone to spend a few extra dollars, and find a travel video with more flavor than this one."
2,read it before,"The Wisdom of Menopause is more comprehensive and reader friendly. With this book, I thought I would have more specific information regarding moods and movements."
5,"Good Deal, good product","This is a cheapest deal I ever seen for this item. I really love it, I also bought for several of my friends, they also has really satisfied with it, still waiting for it to be in stock so I can buy for several more of my friends"
1,An Utter Piece Of Garbage,"The author, George A Stern Jr, does a good job with this book making the reader feel like a complete buffoon. He writes about stuff any sane person already knows and in such a manner that makes it so boring it's almost completely unreadable. Avoid like the plague."
1,Total Bore,The PROBLEM with the book is that it's so boring. I TRY to continue reading it but I CANT. Each chapter is just so boring I can't take it. I would not even recommend this book to someone I didn't like. In conclusion; don't read this book.
3,Looks great; works ok,"I love the way this combo salt/pepper looks, it works pretty well but does not hold much salt & the pepper mill can be sticky at times. Otherwise, good purchase for the price."
3,Game is so so,PS3 lacks motorcycle games. Bought this for the PS2 and it reminded me of how bad the graphics are on that system. Gameplay is not bad though. I would recommend Suzuki Super Bikes over this game.
4,A great game with one drawback.,"Being right-handed, I wish the option to steer with the right analog stick and throttle/brake with the left analog stick was available. Alas, it's not. Yes, I'm well aware the throttle is on the right in the real world. Even so, I'd gladly trade a more realistic controller layout for greater steering precision."
3,Not the best race game.,"A pretty good game except it's really difficult to make the motorcycles corner! Great graphic's,good track slection's,but poor physic's while attempting high speed turn's."
2,Cut sweet cravings?? No way!,"After reading the information on the Chocla Slim squares, I thought I would give them a try. I get serious cravings for sweets in the late afternoon, so I thought taking this product after lunch or with an afternoon snack would help. Boy was I wrong! It did absolutely nothing to curb my sweet tooth! Infact, I ate 3 squares after lunch and was craving for more sweets shortly after. Definitely not worth the money spent!"
5,Inteligent sex,Liz really makes sense with this book. Like a lawyer building her case she systematicaly convicts conventional sex. Her arguments are extraordinary. More to the point what she's saying has the undeniable ring of truth to it. As you read this book light bulbs keep poping off in your head. Definitely worth the read and also a try.
2,You get what you pay for,"While I think this system might work for some people, it did not for me. When I adjusted the switch for microphone volume, my callers could hear me fine, but my local AM radio station was bleeding through loud and clear. I demonstrated it to the Amazon return technician on the phone and he was flabbergasted and agreed right away to give me a full refund, including pre-paid shipping.I will certainly consider buying a more expensive model and I will definitely buy it from Amazon. They are great to work with."
2,Not good for Call Center environments,"The headset works fine, unless you're in a call center or other such environment where you have other people ""feeding"" you information on what to say while on the telephone.I was on with a client who decided to ask some difficult questions. My supervisor happened to be monitoring the conversation and proceeded to ""feed"" me what to say to handle these questions. It turns out that the client has heard EVERYTHING that my supervisor was saying. Of course, I lost the deal. I come to find out later that this headset (as is the case with most cheaper headsets) will allow ALL communication through to ALL of the parties involved.So if you're in a situation where people MAY feed you information while you're on the phone, DO NOT BUY THIS HEADSET or other cheap versions. Other than this incident, it works fine -- good quality sound etc..."
2,Short-stemmed Microphone Is Frustrating to Use,"I am disappointed in this product's performance because the microphone's flexible stem is an inch or so too short to be positioned optimally. As a result, the microphone remains somewhere to the left of my speaking voice. Some callers have told me that my voice seems ""far away."" When I bend the stem to get closer to the microphone, the arm is long enough to catch one side of my mouth but too short to be positioned directly in front of me with an inch or so of ""breathing room."" I often resort to switching from the headset to the handheld telephone midway through a conversation."
5,Good set for the price,"Overall for not having to buy an amplifier, this set works really good. After seeing mine, our clerk bought one too. Our office has a cheap AT&T multi-line phone system. I bought two others before I found this one that works. At one point,I thought I had a problem with the microphone but I just needed to change the batteries. I did find this product for a cheaper price at another site, but I trust buying from Amazon. They are accurate, and prompt."
4,"Not a bad product, however...","This is a very simple product that works well. It is pretty durable and It you do not have to be in perfect Line of Sight for this to work.The only issue I had. Was I bought this and a wireless 360 controller at the same time, But it turns out the controller came with one anyway."
4,Works exactly like the Microsoft brand version,"I was wary at first because this was not a first party product, but after figuring out some install issues, this accessory worked like a charm. NOTE: For those purchasing this, do not use the software provided when installing the driver. Go here [...] and download the driver from Microsoft's site directly. That will save you lots of time uninstalling/installing faulty drivers.Overall great product!"
2,works sometimes,this worked ok for the first few months then nothing. dont bother either spend more on a good pc controller or buy a wired controller
5,Fantastic Product,"I was a little scared to buy this product; I read in the comments that it was a knockoff. This is a knockoff, but a very good one at that. The device works flawlessly. I've used it with three computers of varying age and haven't had a problem yet.The absolute only thing I can think of that is bad about this product is the driver CD. The drivers come on a mini-disk. My laptop has a slot loading drive, so I had to use another computer that could read mini-disks to get the files from the CD. (For those interested, I made an ISO of the disk and dropbox'd it over to my laptop. It's like 5MB or something insignificant like that.)Overall a fantastic product. Looks nearly identical to the legitimate version (which was discontinued).10/10, I would buy this again."
5,works great,I have not had any problems with this device. works flawlessly with Windows XP Pro.The one thing i can find wrong with this product is that it does not currently support the chatpad.
3,works great,"works fine. thought it was new, but it was an open package, but none the less it works! great product to have a pc controller that you already have with your xbox360"
4,nice addon,"This is a good addon if you want to use xbox controller for the pc. However, I notice that microsoft has a bundle product called xbox 360 wireless controller for windows which is basically a xbox 360 wieless controller+ this receiver. price is 49.99 on Amazon. a regular xbox 360 controller will cost you $40+,so you may think about buying that one if you also want more controllers.Other than that this receiver works great. Test with PES2009, Tomb raider underword game. but the software comes with it does not work with vista, need to download new software from Microsoft website. that's why i gave it four starts.Enjoy."
1,Counterfeit!! Counterfeit!!Counterfeit!!Counterfeit!!Counterfeit!!,"This is a COUNTERFEIT AND IT'S FROM HONG KONG!!! Don't be like me and PLEASE read the reviews. You'll become a better shopper if you READ the reviews!!! If you buy this item and decide to send it back. You'll have to pay shipping cost which cost as much as the item. So you're basically stuck. However, if you do decide to buy this item just buy it from Amazon and not this seller."
1,Be aware!,"I knew this was not a genuine Microsoft product. But it was cheap, so I gave it a shot. I had to follow the procedure as other reviewers have mentioned and finally made the Windows recognized the receiver.However, the controller keeps loosing connections and tries to reconnect every 1 minute or even every few seconds. It drove me crazy. I tried to remove all other usb connections because some said that it drains too much power. But, nothing was successful to make this device work consistently.I gave up and bought the genuine Microsoft product and it worked right away! There was no connection issues at all.I would NOT RECOMMEND this product. Don't waste your money and time."
5,It works!,Was very frustrated trying to get my wireless controller to work on my computer... This thing made it effortless! Great!
4,Worked the way it was supposed to.,I have Windows Ultimate x64 and found that this was not plug and play like some others have experienced. But it did come with drivers that worked like a charm.
5,"I'm a moron, and this thing works perfectly","When setting this up, be sure to press the tiny sync button on the back side of your 360 controller after pressing it on the wireless receiver. I stupidly forgot this step and wallowed in frustration for longer than I should (it's even in the directions). It synchs up immediately and works flawlessly with the drivers supplied. I tried it with different USB ports and computers without issue (a win 7 x64 desktop with lots of other peripherals attached, and a win xp laptop with nothing else attached). The range is fine and I didn't notice any controller lag. I also tried the latest drivers for Microsoft's version of the gaming receiver and they worked perfectly, but the supplied older drivers are fine as well.My only complaint is that I can't figure out how to turn off the 360 controller once it's on and synched, aside from removing the battery pack. I'm probably just missing something obvious, though."
5,Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver for Windows,"Works without a dought, I love itit handles my xbox controller very well. And games are some more fun now."
5,"Genuine? don't know, don't care. It works great!","Easy to install, worked perfectly for me on all of the games I own. I used an xbox 360 controller that I have had for a while now."
3,Barely works.,"This product only works on USB 2.0 (the high powered ones) and even then only if you unplug almost every single unnecessary USB device. This thing devours power, apparently, since it supports 4 controller support and even the headset plugins. The sad part is that it does not have a configuration utility to play non-Games for Windows games--as well the documentation that comes with it so barebones as to render it useless.I called Microsoft to see if they could help me with it and they told me to send it back via UPS to a certain address and they'd send me a new one, since the 360 was under warranty. But I knew that it worked, I just needed help troubleshooting it. The main problem was that it needs as much possible juice as it can get. If that is the case I wish they would have install an additional USB plug extension attached to the regular one like what comes with internal to external hard disk drive adapters.All in all this was a waste of money."
1,Beware!!,"As some has said already Microsoft release this way too early and with no support, Gaming forums are alight with this product right now because its incompatible with any type of logitech wireless mouse or keyboard plugged into the same computer, there is no fix other than don't use it. When i installed the drivers for this on my windows XP machine my Logitech mouse stopped responding, only way to fix this is unplug the Xbox wireless receiver and reboot.. Thats said i am keeping mine because im sure that Ms will have a fix for this at some point soon. But beware all the same."
3,Warning: This is not the official product!,"This is not an official Microsoft product, and does not work out of the box. That said, with some work and a few internet tutorials you can coax it into working...sometimes. The device is not recognized by Windows, so you have to manually select the drivers for it EVERY TIME YOU PLUG IT IN. Also, if you haven't used it in awhile, you'll have issues syncing, requiring you to, again, reinstall the drivers.Really, if this was as expensive as the real deal, I'd be sending it back, but at a savings of $40+, it's worth the hassle."
5,Works Perfectly!,The set up was easy and works great with windows 8. No issues connecting receiver with the controller. Would recommend to anyone.
1,very bad,"I got a dublicated XBox 360 PC Wireless Gaming Receiver ,I don't know if the seller did that in perpuse or it was a mistake any how I'll never deal with them any more, returning the Item will cost me its price sinse I live out the US><"
4,no controller included,The product works just fine despite mail man leaving it out in the rain. I'm a little disappointed that it takes 3 weeks to ship this considering its a domestic shipment and people purchasing should note that no controller is included despite what the picture shows.
4,excellent receiver,"I had been searching everywhere for this receiver, but could not find it anywhere, and I'm glad i finally found it. I got it within a couple days of ordering and it worked perfectly when i plugged it in. I have tried it with Halo PC and Call of Duty: World at War, but only could use a controller in Halo. It plugs in USB and works just like the wireless in the xbox, just hold the search button on it and your controller and it connects pretty quickly."
5,Easy to setup and use.,"Works well with my supported Steam games, and using xpadder allows me to use the rest of my games.Installed on a Windows 7 machine and drivers were downloaded automatically, as expected. The installation CD only added a small battery indicator when you press the center button on the Xbox controller, however it is nice to see this."
4,Great once you download the driver...,"There were issues with the supplied disc but after finding the drivers on line, everything worked great!!!Do a search for ""xbox 360 wireless receiver driver"" and click on the link from microsoft. Click on the gaming heading; under ""Controller"" click on ""Xbox 360 Wireless Controller for Windows"". Install and enjoy.Hope this was helpful."""
4,Plug and Play,"I saw some reviews stating that they had troubling setting this up and getting it to recognize their controller so I was hesitant to pick it up. When I got it I plugged it in then I searched through the device's properties and had Windows correct the drivers and it worked beautifully! So great for playing platforming games and others that require the precision movement the analog stick provides that the ""WASD"" keys are incapable of. Sorry I can't remember the exact process, but it does work."
5,This thing is amazing!,"I bought this almost a year ago and I love it. When I bought it, it was almost $30. And I think it was worth every penny.I use this mostly with Steam. But with JoyToKey I can play almost any PC game with my Xbox 360 controller.Or i can sit back and use it as a mouse if I wanted.I am getting a second one soon for my girlfriend."
1,Awful.,This is a waste of money. It does not work. It is not from Microsoft. Buy a controller for your PC from the Microsoft website.
1,This doesnt work,"I bought a device for playing Guitar Hero. But when i tried to used it, i couldnt cuz the driver didnt work. I tried to install it in three diferents computer but i couldnt. I downloanded the drivers from microsoft's web page, but that didnt work neither. So, i want to know how makes it work or i want a refound!"
5,Works as advertized,On my windows 8 computer I plugged this in and it immediately installed the drivers without my intervention. I pushed the sync button on the controller and the receiver and the controller connected w/out an issue. I have a few games that claim to work with the xbox controller and they worked w/no settings modifications. I have my doubts this is a genuine Microsoft product but it works exactly the same so I don't care.
5,"Fully functional, convenient, no hassle",This device is a very simple and efficient product to use in order to connect your XBOX 360 wireless controller for use on the PC.
3,Was great until it died.,Mine worked right from the start and was an easy installation. That was about 5 months ago. A couple days ago I unplugged it because I wasn't playing any games that needed a controller and when I plugged it back in the receiver didn't light up nor worked at all. I did some research and found out that these receivers are susceptible to overheating and the circuitry inside began to melt. As fun as it is to use a wireless controller while gunning down terrorists in Modern Warfare or fighting Dragons in Skyrim. I think I'll just purchase a Wired controller from now on.
2,"Omg, do not buy this thing.","This is a horrible Chinese knock off. If you do buy it, make sure you can buy the real thing later. It was hard as hell to install. Like another review said, you need to update the drivers and install it as a microsoft common class receiver. It does work, and I have no issues with my 360 wireless, but I give it 2 - 4 months before it breaks or just stops working. Do yourself a favor, buy the Microsoft one for 10 bucks more. It does however work once you get passed the installation."
5,Works great,Works exactly as expected and the seller shipped very quickly. I would recommend this product and this seller to a friend.
3,Just ok,You have to really play a lot of FPS games to enjoy. Sometimes the keyboard just feels more natural.
1,Doesn't like Logitech,"As others have said, it has critical problems with Logitech wireless mice. For the life of me, I can't imagine how they allow such a product to hit the market without testing it with mice of one of the most popular brands in the world. Sucks."
2,Doesn't Work With Vista,"Leave it to Microsoft to release a product that doesn't work with their new operating system. I'm sure they will eventually release a vista driver and software, but when?"
1,Wait a few weeks - Not compatible with Vista Ultimate,"I have Vista Ultimate, all updates installed, the latest release of the wireless reciever's drivers (1.10.118.0), USB 2.0 and everything else and this unit will not work.It will however work on XP, I have a dual boot system. Which means there's nothing wrong with my hardware and that this is a big driver problem for Microsoft.And to quote another reviewer ""leave it to Microsoft to release a new product that's incompatible with their latest and 'greatest' Operating System""."
3,user friendly,"I originally got this for emulators. when you finally get it working.. it works just fine. but this item is not user friendly. after dozens of google questions, many different installation guides, and 2 or 3 3rd party programs I got it working.."
3,"Came on time and its what i needed, but it doesnt work very nice on windows","Came on time and its what i needed, but it doesnt work very nice on windows"
5,Handy,"This is a very handy device to have if you're making the switch (or just want to use your controller on your PC) from Xbox 360 to PC, but still want to retain your controller skill. The adapter installs quickly and works on everything stated AND on Windows 7 (just directs you to the download page and you're good to go).I highly recommend this adapter, very cool."
2,"Terrible documentation, support and setup","I couldn't figure out why my wireless logitech mouse wouldn't work and neither would my receiver on my newly installed Vista system. Turns out they were incompatible. Even when I did get it to work, the triggers were programmed as two directions on the same axis. When you pull both triggers, they cancel each other out. This could've been the perfect accessory but Microsoft really dropped the ball with the drivers and documentation."
2,mouse woes,"i picked this thing up specifically for headset use, and haven't even gotten to the connection part of setting this thing up, as myLogitech G5 Laser Mousegoes completely DEAD when i plug the wireless reciever in...seems like a good idea, but microsoft needs to update the drivers so they're more compatable with other USB items"
3,x360 wireless adapter for windows - NOT MICROSOFT !!,"This product works well for advanced users as it is not the official Microsoft product. The picture displays and XBOX 360 wireless adapter, but it is actually just some x360 adapter made in China. When you try to install the drivers using the setup exe on the disc it does not work, some incompatibility with Windows 7 x64,so you have to manually install the drivers and select them from the appropriate folder on the disc. You can find directions on how to do this by troubleshooting, the Windows help is very clear on explaining how to do this. All this being said, the adapter works VERY well, connects almost instantly when the controller is turned on, and definitely beats paying $50 the official Microsoft product!"
5,Works on 64 bit Windows 7,"FYI works on Windows 7 64 bit, you need to download the drivers manually from Microsoft, do not rely on the auto install on windows 7."
5,"Works great, despite concerns","Just wanted to give an update for people looking at this in late 2011 or after. Microsoft has apparently stopped producing these things so an ""official"" new version on amazon may be hard to come by. The version I received is black, and has ""Microsoft"" on the top and bottom, so it appears legit, but doesn't come in any official packaging. However it did come with official looking instructions and cd (cd is not needed because device installs itself).Either way, it works great, and I could not detect any real added lag over a wired 360 controller. Played Crysis 2 on Origin and Bastion on Steam, both worked like a charm. For a PC player who grew up with consoles this thing is awesome, especially if playing on a TV in front of the couch."
1,Counterfeit,"I have two main problems with this item.1. It is NOT new as advertised. Clearly the package has been opened before.2. IT IS A COUNTERFEIT! That's right, it and its packaging are covered in false XBox, Windows, USB and other trademarks. It is clearly some cheap Chinese knockoff that probably won't even work. I am afraid to even try it as the obviously bogus driver CD might have a virus or something on it.Seller refuses to refund my money even though it is ILLEGAL to sell counterfeit goods in the US. I would strongly recommend that nobody buy anything from this seller."
3,Works well,"This product does what it says and allows you to use a 360 controller on your PC. The only problem I found, was trying to turn off the controller when finished. I actually had to take the batteries out for it to shut off. Other than that, it's great!"
1,Radio interference kills WiFi,"I bought this to use with the wireless XBox360 controller under Windows XP (for games like Psychonauts, etc.)Driver support is terrible. I had to look to 3rd party software (XPAdder) just to get the controller working, and the trigger buttons are still not usable.Worse yet the wireless receiver transmits so much radio interference even when not in use that it kills my WiFi signal. With the receiver plugged in and as far way from the PC as the cord will allow, I get under 400kbps download speeds. Unplug the receiver, and I get 8Mbps (roughly 20x faster). I've tried changing WiFi channels, etc. to no avail. I suspect it's even noisy enough it's been interfering with Wii and PS3 wifi in the next room.Complete waste of money. I'm betting most normal users aren't even aware their WiFi woes may be due to this device."
3,"i recieve black one, not like in picture","i received black one, not like that you show in the picture(white), about quality it's goodthank you very much"
4,Set-up directions could be more clear,"But once it was working it worked perfectly. Small enough to be out of the way. Not too expensive either, IMO."
5,Works Great!,This is a cool edition to my gaming PC. The XBOX 360 controllers sync up quick and work great - no lag. I recommend these to anyone.
4,It Does Work but....,It finally worked for me too. Thank goodness since it's Christmas! I had to go to the Microsoft website to download the correct software: [...] And then rebooted and used the instructions everyone else give below about how to apply the driver - I chose the 2.0 (top one) and Voila! it started working! Hope that helps!
2,Not Like Being Hardwired,"I got this thinking that the connection would be equivalent to being hardwired, but I was wrong! The connection quality is great when sitting close to the receiver, but if you have a big living room and sit about 10M from the receiver then don't even bother. You start noticing lag and delay while pushing buttons rapidly.Bottom line, I'm sticking to my hardwired controller."
4,"works perfectly, get it on sale","Fixed my problem instantly (I only own wireless Xbox controllers, Microsoft brand, and plugging them in to my PC with the original charger cords was not working). Soooo much more convenient than gaming on a keyboard, for certain games!"
4,"Probably legit, but still appears to be gray market","This appears identical to the official Microsoft product in look, feel, and materials. It does, however, lack a hologram. I got this from Total Console.It does install perfectly with the official Microsoft driver. So, I believe the hardware is made in the same factory on the same equipment as the real deal, but it does lack the hologram."
3,Works as intended,"Somewhat tricky to get going on window 7 64 bit but they have since updated the drivers. Controllers sync easy and faster than an xbox 360 console. The software doesn't give you control over anything, only displays controller connected and low battery, other than that you have no gauge for the battery life. It essentially works as a bridge to connect your wireless device to the PC and works great with games that have controller support but doesn't allow for customization. My original device broke due to physical damages and wear and tear after a year. On my first device (white) the cord had a tendency to pull out of the receiver which eventually caused the wires to lose connection. My new one (black) has been working better and was cheaper than the official Microsoft product and is compatible with the OEM drivers"
2,poor product support,"Purchased and set it up with out any issues. It worked for 5 months then it broke. Verified with Microsoft that it was indeed dead and could not be fixed. They only offer a 90-day warranty on this which shows how flaky it is if Microsoft won't warranty it the standard year all electronic products get. They also mentioned it was discontinued so even if it broke within 90-days from purchase, they don't have replacements to give out.I looked online to see what can be done to fix this and it seems there is a fuse that frequently burns out and can only be replaced by taking it apart and soldering a new one back on. $20 down the drain and now I have to buy another one."
5,Works!,"It works like a dream. Ever since I bought this I've had absolutely zero problems playing PC games with my Xbox controller. I can sit 15 feet away from the receiver and my controller still works beautifully. I haven't found a range limit yet, but you'll be able to use your gamepad from any reasonable distance."
3,What I paid for.,It's what I paid for. Not flashy or well designed but entirely gets the job done. Only real annoying thing is that it works poorly in OSX Mountain Lion. No official driver support and the homebrewed stuff is really meh.
5,Works Perfectly,"I was a bit skeptical as to whether this would work on my Mac, but with the proper drivers (which can be found online) it works fine. It also works under Windows 7 (Boot Camp)."
1,DON'T BUY A FAKE ONE!,"DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU LIKE FAKE ITEMS THAT DO NOT WORK!ONLY THE ONES THAT SAY ""MICROSOFT"" ARE LEGIT - THE FAKE ONES SAY ""XBOX 360"" ON THEM."
4,Works as intended!,"I have been using it for the past week on Battlefield 3. I am too used to the 360 controller for vehicle controls, so this little guy helps me out a lot!"
3,"Not the real thing, but it does work...","Even though the pictures show what appears to be an actual MICROSOFT wireless gaming receiver, that's not what you get when you buy this product. You get some chinese mock one.It does work however, and well.The only complicated parts was getting it set up.I know there's tutorials on here but this is how you do it, and the easiest way that worked for me:1) Go to Control Panel2) Hardware and Sound3) Device Manager4) Right click ""Unknown Device""5) Click ""Update Driver Software...""6) Click ""Browse My Computer For Driver Software"" (Manually)7) Click ""Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer""8) Look for ""Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows"" and click it and you're doneThe drivers are pre-installed on Windows 7 I suppose, so that makes things a lot easier."
2,"Fake, but works","Do not buy this product if you are looking for an official Microsoft product. The images in the posting are not what you will get. Mine came in bulk packaging(A plastic bag, essentially), no English instructions, a low quality cable, poor build quality, and no holographic Microsoft logo.If you don't mind buying a knock off, then by all means, buy this product. It does work. Mine installed without a hitch and was recognized by Skyrim as an Xbox controller. Additionally the official drivers off of Microsoft's own website will work with this. However, if you don't mind a knock off then there are cheaper options out there. I feel ripped off, as from the images and price I thought this would be an official product."
2,"Not made by microsoft, but works...sort of...","This product is not made by microsoft but is instead a rip off. I got this so I can use my wireless racing wheel on my PC. It was a major headache to install. After I finally got it installed I noticed that some of my other programs were not working. After hours of reaserch I determined that this was because of the driver. And further reaserch lead me to realising that this is not a Microsoft product.It works, but be carefull with it. If you don't know what you are doing I would not get this."
2,"Does the job, shipping was HORRIBLE","It took 18 DAYS for me to get this, which is ridiculous! Windows 7(64 bit)didnt find the drivers automatically, and the drivers on the disk they provide are worthless. I ended up finding instructions online that allowed me to get it working. So far, no issues, product works fine. But 2 stars for the 3 week shipping time."
1,Beware--No profiler software,"I'm sure that this product works great if you're going to play a game that automatically supports the 360 controller. However, if the game you play does not specifically say that it supports the 360 controller, don't be surprised if it just doesn't work with it at all. I bought this along withFinal Fantasy XI: The Vana'diel Collection 2007, which I have played on Xbox 360 and now want to play on my computer. But, the software that comes with this gives no options whatsoever for customizing the buttons on the controller, so my computer let me configure the controller fine, but Final Fantasy did not respond to the controller at all. The only option would have been to download a game controller profiler, which cost between $10-20 MORE (after a 30-day free trial). So I decided just to buy the Logitech Rumblepad, partly out of spite because Microsoft should have put a profiler with this."
5,Xbox 360 Wireless Adapter,"The Adapter works perfectly connecting your wireless Xbox 360 controller to your PC, so you can play games like Crysis 2 and Dirt 3 without a keyboard."
2,Not what I expected,"Some had said this wasn't genuine some said it was, figured Id give it a chance by purchasing through VRGamerz, Isn't genuine... figures, really disrespectful and shady way to do business."
1,not for windows 7 (now we know),bought this to game on my pc being told it would work for my wireless controller. had to return it because it is not compatable with windows 7.i was refunded the cost of the item but got stuck with $10 in shipping fees to and from the seller. wish they knew what they were selling
1,DO NOT BUY. BAIT AND SWITCH.,"I ordered what was in the picture. It was to be a gift for a friend. I already own one and know what it looks like, and it looked like what was in the picture: an XBox 360, Microsoft certified product. What I received in the mail was an obvious knockoff. It felt and looked cheap. It only said X 360 on the front. On the back it said PC Wireless Gamind Receiver, and under that --big surprise-- ""made in china"". I was duped. Waiting on their response for a refund, and will update once I get word. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER."
4,Wireless Frenzy,"The wireless 360 accessories are very ergonomical and easy to use. This device will let you use your wireless 360 accessories on a PC with USB 2.0. Including the wireless headset,wheel and control. Binding the accessories is just like on the 360, fast and very easy. Games for Windows Live can easily comply with the 360 control. Some older games may require The Pinnacle software for best porformance. The Wireless headset experience is great. Overall the gaming receiver will make you happy if you can't game with a keyboard and mouse."
4,easy pc setup for wireless gamepads,simple to install a breeze looks very cool and functions 100 percent i love playing pc games with a good analog gamepad this is the item you need for the besy gamepad setup the pc ever seen perfect combo if you have xbox 360 why would you buy another gamepad when you can switch from console to computer while saving at least 30 dollars a gamepad
2,Disappointed,I could not get this to work with my epsxe emmulation software and that is the whole reason I bought it!
1,Didn't work,Worked for literally 5 minutes then broke. DO NOT buy this thing. Just use a PS3 controller plus it's free.
3,Does what it's supposed to,"Driver install is remarkably frustrating, because my computer has a slot-loading DVD Drive. Microsoft, for some reason, decided it would be a wise idea to package this with a mini-cd containing the hardware's driver, a bafflingly poor decision, given that not all CD/DVD-ROM drives are tray-loading drives. If you've got a slot-loading CD-ROM drive (think MacBook Pro or Sony Vaio), make sure you're comfortable looking up driver install data on your own and following instructions from other places (SevenForums is a good one)."
5,Works great,Now if only i had a game to use it with.....Cortex Command it is! I need six more words to submit this review.
1,360 wirless gameing Receiver For The PC,"This is a 3rd party product it has the X BOX 360 lettering on the face,but i didn't see the Microsoft's logo any where!I tried this product on 3 machines win7.xp, and xp pro! No drivers found,the install disc is a joke! It will not do a install when you put the disc in,you have to open andview the files,and then pick and choose!(This is a bummer for the folks that aren't computer savvy!Now on the other hand I do have a wireless gaming receiver from Microsoft with the Microsoft logo and it works perfectly!So Buyers Beware if it doesn't have the logo on it, don't buy it!Trust me you cant find Drivers for this receiver!Now on the bright side I sent it back for a refund no problem!"
1,This absolutely doesnt work in win8,"Got this , not genuine, which is a bummer as it shows a genuine, on top of that I didn't get a new one that was genuine upon complaint. (false advertising and that's illegal) anyhow. I had this working on xp, fine. I upgraded to win7 Pro x64, no problem just had to manually install the drivers. Now I'm on windows 8 Pro x64 and its outright not compatible. Frustrating as I just went through the upgrade and now the one device that my kids use most doesn't work. If anyone finds a solution to the windows 8 compatibility please feel free to email me tripping@greenshroom.com"
5,360 Controller on PC? .. Oh yeah!,"This thing is amazing. I can play mostly all of my PC games on my computer now. And that makes it well worth the price. The only problem is that if you use this item with the Play and Charge Kit, it will automatically change your controller to work with the computer, rather than your Xbox (I feel I'm safely assuming that anyone reading this also has an Xbox 360, most likely in the same room.). So this can be a bit troublesome to anyone gaming together in the same room with a few of those cords charging their controllers."
3,"Great idea, bad execution.","While this was certainly a great idea, the execution was lousy. The analog sticks on the controller have a nasty habit of getting stuck in a position near center no matter how much I tweak the dead zones. The wireless headset's volume is ridiculously low, even with the record volume maxed out. Judging by the fact that neither of these issues show up when using both devices with the 360, I'd say it's either a flaw in the receiver or a software problem. Hopefully it's the latter, which should be resolved in a future update. As of this review, the software is still version 1.1 (which was simply a compatibility update for Vista, it does nothing to solve the issues)."
1,Does not work!! There is no tech support either.,"Tried 3 of these with VISTA OS and they will not work. They do not even show up in the control panel gamepad section. Tried to find info at Microsoft Support - forget it they did not even know they made them. So until the techs at Microsoft get off their high hats and actually perform support, don't waste your time or money.The Logitech wireless works great and is half the price. I use this with Oblivion and a 2nd party Pinnacle program to set up the controls and whoh it works..."
2,Useless...,"...its only too bad that many PC games don't support dual analog controls, and none have features specifically for the 360 style controller, not even Microsoft games like Halo 2. Not to mention the drivers included are absolutely useless, it isn't even configurable under the ""Game Controllers"" part of the control panel. And if you have Vista, as of now you are out of luck. Which is ironic as hell, seeing as this is a Microsoft product."
1,Lemon,"The product came in bubble wrap with no manual. There is no official Microsoft seal on the back. Instead of white, it is all dark gray. The device doesn't work at all. Can't help but feel my money has been stolen. Possibly going to reverse the charge and return it to wherever it came from."
1,Poor driver support,"The software drivers for Vista/7 are incomplete, and there seems to be no plan to complete them. The XBox 360 steering wheel has its gas and brake pedal compressed to one axis (instead of 2 separate axis like it should) and there is no force-feedback under Vista/7. Microsoft claimed a patch was incoming over a year ago, but it never arrived. It seems this peripheral is being abandoned and no longer supported. I wouldn't recommend it, and would not have purchased it if I knew the drivers were incomplete."
4,"After a tricky installation, works just fine","Got this and the installation CD it came with had what appeared to be a cigarette burn in it. After about an hour of unsuccessfully trying to find drivers from the manufacturer, I followed the steps JD laid out and that worked like a charm.After the installation everything works flawlessly. The product also looks pretty legitimate and doesn't look or feel cheap aside from the driver disc."
2,This is not an official Microsoft product,"Well its a knock off, its not the official product that's pictured. The driver on the disk are outdated and cant be used with Windows 7, I did get it to work following the guides reviewers left here. I cant recommend this to anyone, spend the extra money and get the real deal. I will be leaving negative feedback on the sellers profile."
5,Awesome Product!,"Set It and forget it. This is the perfect tool for those of us who have ever tried map a joystick, use a pre-mapped USB controller or use the keyboard for more than a click fest RPG. Maps and syncs with most newer games automatically. One of my top-ten best purchases ever!"
3,Does what is says,"I like it and it does what it advertises, but the thing timeouts the controller after a while and most games will have you close and reconnect to get the controller working again. You would be better off buying a wired 360 controller for your PC."
2,Annoying to set up because it's fake,"Don't trust the listing, it isn't a Microsoft product. The packaging makes it look like an official product but the lack of a authenticity hologram sticker and the dodgy looking disc full of outdated drivers are two major clues. Then when you plug it in and your computer says ""unknown device"" you know something is definitely wrong. Eventually after downloading the official software and fiddling with it for a bit, it does work but it's no better than the cheaper wireless receivers that don't pretend to be Microsoft products."
5,I does exactly what it is supposed to,"Plug and play. High quality materiel's. It didn't break, and it is easy to use. Make sure to buy the Xbox brand."
5,Excellent piece of technology!,"I just have to say this is a great priduct. I read alot of reviews before buying the reciever. All of which stated they had one problem or another, or that it was not a genuine microsoft product. When I got it, it looked like the one people were saying was the genuine article. Further more when I plugged the device in I had already dowloaded and installed the software, and the device started working without a hitch. I highly recommend this product to all gamers. Great product and great fun!!!"
1,Wireless Gaming Receiver,Don't be fooled by the ad. This is not a Microsoft product. Could not get it to work. Ended up buying Microsoft wireless controller for Windows.
5,Ready to go out of box,"This adapter was ready to go right out of the box. No drivers to install, but I think that is because my Surface was up to date on the software. Connects to my Xbox controller easy and makes gaming easier. Yes I would recommend this adapter."
3,good for games,"Plug it in and it works. For me, three stars = meets expectations.This lets you use a wireless MS controller. On some evenings I don't want to use a keyboard to play a game."
5,Great Adapter,"I enjoy the look and feel of Xbox controllers, and this allows me to use that controller on the PC. I quickly found that many controller enabled games automatically detected that i had a Xbox controller attached, and had already configured themselves to use it, which was really handy. It also works well for the various emulators i use, which is a plus."
1,RIDICULOUS!!!!!,"i bought one from HDE and got RIPPED! it wasnt a microsoft reciever, it was a generic and they sent me basically a piece of plastic that wouldnt work. i later purchased a legit microsoft reciever and it works great. stay away from HDE."
2,Finding the source,After several attempts of setting up a wireless controller I'm still having difficutly making a connection.
1,Don't buy this!,Don't buy wireless adapters for computers unless you really want to. Just buy a wired controller to start off with. Benefits of wired are no batteries and direct connection to your computer. Simple as that.
1,Did not work properly on Win 7 64 Bit machine,"Did not work properly on Win 7 64 Bit machine , we tried various USB ports, and sometimes we would get a connect, BUT only intermittent and VERY unstable."
3,"No controller, misleading pictures.","I wish I had known that the product did not come with a controller. For an extra $xx.xx I would have been able to have had the controller and the receiver had I bought somewhere else. Great for playing most games, I am having fun just feel like I've been had a little bit."
5,Awesomeness in your ear,"Setup is super easy. its a small attractive receiver, i was expecting it to be bigger. i can walk into another room and not get any loss or quality. (i was expecting choppy sounds like driving with a cell phone).I did not get this for the 360, i got it for my pc. so very pleased with device. very comfy.... almost makes love to your ear!!!!best part is its intuitive to use... u can LOOK at the buttons once, and navigate while in your ear with any problems... unless your fingers are like cucumbers.dont hesitate!"
1,Not Plug-N-Play for everyone...,"After spending 4 hours trying to get this puppy working w/ Windows XP, and numerous time sorting through forums, I've come to the following realization: This product was released too early! My first clue was the lack of support from Microsoft (when I called, they didn't even know what it was!) Check the forums (or just google this thing) - you'll see what I'm talking about! And forget it, if you have a wireless mouse that runs on 2.4Ghz..."
1,Not genuine never works,Garbage unofficial accessory that is basically a hunk of plastic. Did not work through any USB ports. Installing drivers did nothing.
3,"Good Product, however not as described in the pictures above","I ordered two of these, a black and white, the black was cheaper, so i paid the extra for this one which is from the pictures, apparently white in colour, however, i recieved two black recievers, having paid extra for one. i am a bit disappointed, however this is a minor mishap, still a good product."
2,Good for the Standard Version But...,"Visio 2000 Bible is a great book for users who want a better understanding of the basic features of Visio 2000. The book lacks is a covering of the features of Visio 2000 that are part of the Professional, Technical or Enterprise versions.I was hoping that this book would cover features of the program that are included in the Professional and Enterprise editions.I bought the book to learn of the features in the Enterprise edition, but not one mention of the features in the Enterprise edition was found.The book coverage is meant more for people just learning about Visio than for people who are accomplished users of the Visio line of products"
3,Disappointing 3rd Season,"I am a fan of Torchwood, not so much of Dr. Who. After a disappointing ending to Season 2 with killing off 2 of the main characters, the 3rd season was very depressing, especially when Ianto is killed off at the end.I am surprised that there will even be a 4th season after the way season 3 ended.I hope that my interest can be picked back up."
1,Very Disappointed,"The show was always quirky to me. But this was just a downright disappointing story arc.My only comment in regards to this show is to say that either the writers don't get it or they don't care. And if you watched the series and are honest with yourself, then regardless of whether you liked it or not you will agree they spent more time trying to push emotional buttons.If I wanted something this low brow, I'd still watch Lost.My advice to those involved with the show is to let Capt. Jack rest in peace. You've screwed that character up enough. Let what's left of him rest in peace."
1,How To Massacre A TV Series,"Start by killing off two main characters in the 2nd season. Then wait a really long time before you release any semblance of 3rd season. Then, exterminate one more main character and alienate another. What do you have left? Eve Myles, just waiting for the Doctor to come along and whisk her away as his new companion. Bye Bye Torchwood.If this could be given less than one star, I'd certainly do it. The story and acting were phenomenal until the end of the 4th hour. Then the whole thing totally Jumped The Shark and went straight down the crapper.What a terrible loss and a complete waste of time for everyone involved."
3,Too much disaster!,"It's like a train wreck! You have to keep watching. Do you want to see the bloody wreckage, no.At the end, worth the emotional sacrifice? NO. Entertainment value however 110%, if you're willing to stop here.Caution. Extreme caution!!Seriously"
5,Brilliant,"Torchwood: Children of Earth is brilliant. Action packed, moving, and suspenseful, it has it all. This was my first Blu-Ray purchase and the picture is stunning. The packaging notes that the music heard on the disc for Day 5 is not the same as heard on the BBC broadcast. I haven't gone back and listened to both to hear the differences, but nothing is really jarring or immediately noticeable as being different.If you are a fan of Doctor Who and Torchwood, this is a must-see."
3,Movies from books,My sisterinlaw & my husband watched this series and they both loved it. They both said they would like to have the whole set. They said they would reccommend getting it.
5,A don't miss season of this under-rated series,"I grew up on the Doctor, from Troughton to the famous scarf, to the idiotic Celery stalk (stopped watching then). Pertwee and Baker are still my favorites from the original series. The current doctor, the fool who acts like a 12 year old, needs lessons. The current incarnation could learn much from this final BBC produced season of Torchwood (Starz picked it up for an additional season.) It's dark, moody, and not for kids. We see captain Jack's dangerous side, and what happens to those who are close to him. The Doctor's companions simply leave. In the earlier series, they often died. Much more believable, and this five episode series is just that. Believable. Politicians act exactly as we expect, and as they probably would act.The other reviews go into details. I'll just add that if you like SF, British SF, captain Jack or the Whovian universe, don't miss this. The first few episodes build up the tension. The final episode goes for broke."
1,It was ok,It was ok. But compared to Seasons 1 and 2 COE sucked. Some of the scenes were beautiful but there were so many plot holes that really bugged me badly.
2,Disappointing...,I love the Torchwood series. This series is very disappointing. Very long drawn-out plot. Shallow character development. Very predictable ending. Lots of melodramatic scenes over people you just can't care about. For some reason Gwen's husband complains about being cold all the time... What is most disappointing is they killed off Ianto over a lame plot. Watch it on TV and DVR or TiVo it. Not worth a purchase.
5,Wonderfully done! But...,"!MOOD SPOILERS! By which I mean I'm not giving any details but this review will give you a fair idea of the direction of the theme:This mini-series was: A) Marvelously done, and B) About the most gut-wrenching thing I've ever seen where you could still fathom there being another season after it. Not a happy story, and don't watch it expecting to come out of it happy. Despite this, it was wonderfully done. The acting was superb, the moral dilemmas tangible, and the protagonists actually had to make permanent and wrenching decision when faced with Hobson's choice. I'm impressed.On that note though, while I liked the show, I've never felt strongly attached to Torchwood's characters. This story made me identify with them more than I ever have before, and I can see that a more devoted fan would be horrified at what the writers do to their much beloved characters.My final recommendation: Well worth watching, but not while you're already depressed."
1,A waste of time,I just watched this special on TV and it has to be the worst (or at least one of the worst) shows I have ever seen. An unbelievable waste of time. I have to admit i kept watching out of amazement as to how bad it was. The story line made no sense. The main torchwood characters were a joke. In one scene the Torchwood men confront the aliens with extreme bravado but immediately cave to cowering little girls when the aliens fight back. Amazing. Don't waste your time or money. I cannot believe anyone would like this.
1,Disturbed.....,"Okay; I finally got around watching COE and I don't know what Russell T Davies had in his head when he was writing this. All I can say is that I was sick to my stomach with how much death was involved in this series (especially one innocent child) and the concept of an alien race keeping children alive for a ""hit"" is just disgusting. Not sure if I want to see Miracle Day now."
1,Not what they made us hope for - it was disappointing!,"The third season of Torchwood was nothing what I expected. And I don't mean that in any way positive. Not only was it even more brutal and violent than any season before, it was also majorly depressing to see everything we cared for in the show was carelessly and unnecessarily killed off. The spoilers had promised a ,new level` in the relationship of the two main characters Ianto Jones and Jack Harkness, but it never was. The story of the long-term-couple everyone adored was written as uninspired and distant as it could be. Well, that in fact WAS the new level. All that made me so angry with a show I used to love and waited for almost a year. The screenwriters did a poor job with this. And I won't even tell what I think of the producers job.When you liked Torchwood and ist characters in the first two seasons I can assure you: there is no need to watch this third season of the show. It was boring, badly written and not worth anyones while."
2,Torchwood: The Big Disappointment,"Sad to say that this is not The Torchwood I raved about to friends. This is not The Torchwood that promised thoughtful, action-packed stories week after week. And alas, this is not The Torchwood that leaves me wanting more. In fact, I doubt I will be back. The reason: some of the weakest SF writing to be found on either side of the Atlantic. It could have been great. Yes, the concept was a rehash, but so are 99.99% of all the great works. The writers might have played with the concept, made it their own, made it Torchwood's. But given the pointless twists, the sloppy logic (I'm being generous by calling the plot logical), the Deus ex Machina ending, the characters behaving out of character, there is little to recommend Torchwood III. I could go on, but won't. And neither should you, unless you don't care what kind of trash you put into your head. Two stars because the actors did their best given the atrocious script. Otherwise, a waste."
3,better grab your tissue it's a tearjerker,"nothing compares to children of earth, i cheated and watched day 5 first. the people i had over to watch this said i can't believe this. i told them grab a tissue cause your going to cry, it is full of action and realistic acting it's that good. watching this will harm you and this seasons not for everyone to view, it will stick in your mind for days. an update} the usa version of children of earth blu-ray does'nt look right the show lags alot, flickering in a few scenes and fast movements ghostly images. i noticed this on the docter who specials too. i tried other usa made movies and tv shows and no problem. so my next move is to get the region free of children of earth, not the usa version."
2,Tprchwood-Childred of Earth,"Long awaited and a welcome way to repeat the 5-night blitz. The 5-nights went so fast, it's a blessing to have the DVD version as many small details are missed the first time through! Watching it over (and over) is a joy. Now, dear Amazon, please carry the 3 radio shows on the BBC 'cause I couldn't figure out how to get the feed from the BBC - besides, then I can listen to them more than once!"
4,My introduction to torchwood was an extreme experience,"I have been wanting to try torchwood for a while and this mini-series was a very affordable entry point into the torchwood mythology. Let's be honest, I'm not sure how ACORN and BBC get away with charging so much for their TV series which are not that many episodes by american standards and b) usually devoid of any kind of special features on the dvds. I enjoyed this mini-series very much. At the same time, I still thought it was too extreme in places. It would be nice if the creator could have given us a happy ending that was unblemished."
1,Torchwood: Children of Earth,"What a total destruction of a great show! I have series 1 and 2 but I will never waste my money on Children of Earth! The plot was stolen, Torchwood didn't even have to be in the show. The Torchwood characters were out of character. It appeared that they were rewritten to fit the story which was definitely not a Torchwood story. This was just another step for RTD to make Gwenwood for the worst character in the cast. They've killed 3 main characters in 4 episodes leaving the immortal Jack and the waste of space Gwen. I will never knowing watch anything by Davies or Gardner again."
4,best science-fiction I've seen in awhile,"My favorite science-fiction uses the form to posit alternative realities the better to reflect on our real world. CHILDREN OF EARTH, besides offering conventional thrills galore, starts as a good, creepy tale and then moves to unflinching political commentary on the priorities of the powerful. The plot twist is both entirely logical and comes as a surprise, and what started as entertainment becomes something more powerful. Peter Capaldi is terrific, but then so is the rest of the cast."
4,Excited to have this on blu-ray,"Because this show is a spinoff of Dr. Who, I have watched it from the beginning. I love scifi and this is very clever. The characters are very quirky and super intelligent and work well with each other. Sadly, two of the characters died in the last season, which leaves Gwen, Capt Jack and Ianto to solve this mystery. I saw the first episode on tv and the premise is that aliens take hold of the childten of the earth and use them to let the adults know that they are coming to take over. What happens next-stay tuned for the next exciting episode! This disc comes with specials that were shown on tv - such as a tour of Torchwood headquaters, interviews with cast and crew. A must see for sci fi fans. The only thing that I find objectionable is the affair between Capt Jack and Ianto but usually they are brief and then the action starts up again. I am glad that this title is on blu-ray."
1,Stupid and depressing waste of time and money!,I'm a big Dr. Who fan and used to be a Torchwood fan but season three is stupid and depressing. Seriously wish I had never seen this and could remember the series fondly. If I could have given this less than one star I would!
2,depressing,"I loved Torchwood seasons 1 and 2. However after watching this, I'm not sure I will be able to watch Torchwood again. Like many have said before the characters are not true to their prior selves. I also was really sad to see yet another member of the team killed off. Then there are all the horrible events that occur in this one series. Being a parent, I especially hated the ending. I believe they took it way too far. Surely there could be a better ending! In any case, I don't think I could take watching this again. In the end its just too depressing."
4,"Entertaining, but not earth shattering","I'm not generally a science fiction fan, but ""Torchwood: Children of Earth"" is a decent mini-series. Some of the subplots are a bit gratuitous, but overall, it's a good premise. It doesn't have some of the ""cheesy"" Doctor Who elements that make the show difficult to take too seriously.I saw ""Children of Earth"" on BBC America, and enjoyed it enough to watch again on Amazon. The overall premise is intriguing, and the momentum is sustained throughout the 5 episodes, even if some of the loose ends are resolved a bit too quickly . . ."
1,horrid ending to a once fab show,I made a huge mistake when i pre-ordered this dvd. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Dislike is a kind word for my feelings over the drastic end of one of my favorite characters. Ianto and Jack were the reason for my watching Torchwood. With the demise of Ianto i no longer will be a viewer. Say what you want but Gwen has taken over as the main character. Yes even over Jack. His role has lessened while hers has grown. If i were John Barrowman i'd move on to where i'm appreciated.
5,Deep shadows and brilliant highlights...,"I've seen many complaints here from long-time Torchwood fans about COE. I eagerly watched the first 2 seasons as they came on BBC America. I was disappointed with the character losses in Season 2 (even though I liked the stories), so I was a bit tentative about COE.After watching it, I can honestly say I loved it. Here's what you have to know going in. It's darker than the darkest shows you've seen in the first 2 seasons and it effectively kills the show. But what a way to go.I thought about Children Of Earth for weeks after watching it, it's that powerful. There are some lapses in logic for sure, but that was always the case with Torchwood. Come on people, the second season opened with a fish driving a car, for God's sake!All I can say is, if you enjoyed the darker episodes of the show and the emotional anguish the characters went through in them, I think you will like this."
5,Best Science Fiction I have seen in a LONG TIME,"It will be impossible to write a review for this if you are ordering it to watch it for the first time, so I will speak in generalities.Even for a blu-ray the picture is spectacular. The scenes above London are incredible. The SQ is great as well.I will say this about the story - how government reacts when confronted with a crisis of a huge magnitude is well portrayed here.I can't say more. If you like Torchwood (or just Captain Jack) BUY THIS SET! If I could give it more stars I would. How about ******* out of five. Really, don't miss this."
2,I waited over a year for THIS?,"Torchwood Season 1 was ok. Season 2 was great fun (until of course the very end). Season 3: It all starts out well enough, but then... Well, let's just say there is little joy here for the characters or for us fans. Torchwood was supposed to be about the Torchwood TEAM, wasn't it? So much for that assumption. (Heck, even the SUV is gone.) Season 4: At this point, who cares? Presumably, Captain Jack continues to overact and dress badly somewhere in the universe, and maybe Gwen and Rhys end up in a happy sitcom world of their own. Everyone else? It was nice to have them around, but they should be relieved to be off this sinking ship."
3,Good just not Torchwood good.,"This is actually a very beautiful piece of artwork. If it wasn't Torchwood I would probably love it. Having watched everything Torchwood from the start I was very dissapointed with it. There are a ton of plot holes and a couple out of charachter parts though I wont say them because it would ruin the plot. The story could have been great but for a 15 month wait I am discusted at all the mistakes. Also, eventhough they have said that 4th season is ready to kick off depending how this one rates Children of Earth set out to destroy Torchwood and has done so very effectivly. Ianto fans wont watch a season 4 Jack fans have turned on him and Gwen fans are out of luck as well. It is very dark so non Torchwood fans may have a hard time with it and Torchwood fans will be devistaited by the end. If you choose to watch it good luck. If you choose to buy it I would wait till it sells for shipping cost on ebay."
1,It stinks,It was a waste of money. Especially because the physical production of the discs leaves them flawed.The stupid thing keeps freezing and faltering... ahh I am sick of the BBC's lack of quality control.Read the other negative reviews before you buy.
4,"This was good, but could have been so much better!","Amazing video and audio quality. The story is very adult but bogs down with too many coincidences.I enjoyed it, but it seemed an excuse to destroy the series. Glad to know it is coming back soon, looking forward to seeing if the writing quality improves."
3,"Exciting, but depressing","** CONTAINS A FEW SPOILERS **I watched the entire mini-series in one sitting. I was on the edge of my seat almost the whole time. Most scenes were very suspenseful and it was very well acted. Now on the downside, I found the whole story very disturbing and depressing. In most all sci-fi series of yester-years, seriously harming children on screen was basically off-limits. The adults did the dying, not the children. Russell T. Davies is known for his ""shock"" scenes and he does not hold back in COE. I enjoyed the show, but he basically destroyed Torchwood and made the Captain Jack we loved from Dr. Who and the 1st Season of Torchwood into a character that you lose all respect for. I know I did. Needless to say, the disturbing story-line and conclusion of the show made me depressed the whole day. I've watched it once, and do not care to see it again, unless maybe I'm on some very good anti-depressants :)"
4,A quality 'psychological horror' episode,I enjoyed the Torchwood: Children of the Earth movie.I wouldn't rate it 5/5 because the children chanting got very repetitive and a bit boring and B-grade.However the rest of the movie was a highly watchable horror flick albeit very dark in places. It kept true to the characters of the Torchwood TV show (continuing on some of the series themes) while taking the plot to a new level of shockable horror.
2,I love Torchwood,"But this was more depressing than anything else. It lacked the fire of the Torchwood that I enjoy so much.Oh, and there should be a warning - don't watch it if you have young children."
5,"Wow, this is mind blowing!!!","This show just gets better and better, so I have a feeling the BBC will probably quit making it. The cast is magical the way they work together. I won't spoil it for you but one of the deaths in the show broke my heart. It was my favorite character and I was hoping that he would continue on it for a long time. Still it is a great show and I highly recommend it to amy Torchwood fans."
4,Great fun.,"Okay, it's merely science fiction, but it is so stylish and done with such style. You have to believe that there is a huge conspiracy to hide the British Government's collusion with various visitors from outer space and that some of them travel through time . . . oh, and the protagonist cannot be killed. Nonetheless, the players are so capable, skillful screen actors who deliver their characterizations with such earnestness and they are all so attractive. The device of using the combined voices of the children of the world to deliver the message of the alien beings is inventive and intriguing. I was drawn into the relationship between the immortal central character and his mortal boyfriend, so much so that I was grieved with the way it ended. There is enough depth to make the piece thought-provoking as well as fun and I think it will engage most audiences. Nice piece of work."
2,Not as good as reviewed,Not as good as reviewed...Did not work on my type of hair and smelled awful. I will not purchase again
4,Only one I've tried,"I like this smoothing balm... I bought it on the recommendation of my hairdresser a while back. I've since moved and need to find another place to buy this stuff from (enter, Amazon!)I like the way it works, smooths & straightens with a slight shimmer. It is a bit expensive, but I hate trying out new products (especially cheaper ones) only to find out they don't really work, and now I'm stuck with an entire bottle of crap that doesn't work. Which is why this is the only straightening balm I've tried."
3,Not sure that it works any better than other deep conditioners,"I've been using this Joico K-Pak for a while but doesn't seem to work well. Over the years, I've tried many smoothers/heat protectans but this one is not as good as others I've tried and it's more expensive. I love the Joico moisture shampoo and conditioner, but I bought this K-Pak and K-Pak deep conditioner, and I'm not satisfied with K-Pak products. I will continue using other Joico products but not K-Pak. Being the most expensive in their line they're not necessarily the best."
4,Wonderful,The product does an excellent job of smoothing my hair and eliminating frizz. A small amount is all that is necessary.
2,Not too happy,This is the first time I used this product and I wasn't happy at all. I hated the way it made my hair feel. The blow dry cream is a much better product.
3,"Love, Lies, and Murder","This 1991 miniseries surrounds the rather twisted family of a very manipulative, selfish, and evil man, David Brown. It begins on a late night in March 1985. David is shown pulling out of his driveway. Soon after, the sound of gunshots awaken this sleepy neighborhood. The other occupants of this house are his wife, Linda, their baby, Amber, Linda's 17 year old sister, Patti Bailey, and David's 14 year old daughter, Cinnamon, from a previous marriage. Linda, his wife, has been shot in the stomach while asleep in bed. From here is the beginning of an investigation that seems to become tangled in its own storyline. Who killed Linda Brown? Why was she wanted dead? Who was behind this gruesome murder? Secrets are revealed, trust is betrayed, and someone is going to pay.This is a rather serious movie with some compelling performances. Justice does prevail in the end, but Linda Brown still can't be brought back."
3,Whatever happened to these people?,"This movie is intriguing to me and I find myself watching it every time I find it while channel surfing. The idea of a father asking his young teenage daughter to murder his wife, her stepmother, makes a compelling story. David Brown, to say the least, is a sociopath. Clancy Brown did such a good job portratying sociopathic behavior that even now when I see him in other films, I always think about his haunting portrayal of David Brown. What I wonder now though is nearly 20 years after Linda Brown's murder, whatever became of Cinnamon Brown and Patty Baily, who were minors when Linda was shot to death."
5,woaaaaaaaaaaa,"i thought this movie was heart wrenching and so sad. it was full of deceit ,lies and totally nieve individuals. the movie is one that i want to buy ,but it's not on d.v.d, it's on vhs only."
2,Not enough bang for your Buck,"First of all, this book is massively overpriced. Fifty dollars plus for a keep paperback. The number of errors is ridiculous so much so that a special errata section is contained in the back. Furthermore, the explanations of the grammer are weak at best. This book is more of a workbook that a text. This of course does you no good unless you have a teacher who knows the answers. Also don't even think about buying this book unless you already have an extremely solid basis in Biblical Hebrew as the author assumes that you do(In all fairness if you are considering buing this book you probably already know Hebrew)."
2,Too many errors,"There are too many errors. I would advise teachers of Aramaic not to use this handbook in the present edition, but to wait for a thoroughly corrected edition (Taken from A. Shoors)"
5,A breath of fresh on all compass points,"When you first listen to this CD your first response may be, ""What category of music is this""? DSN brings Dallas, Texas rock and roll and melds it into something that quite frankly, can't be classified. An excellent CD to bring on a first date; sounds even better in the Georgia mountains on a really cold night."
4,Spectacular!,"This book is about touching stories of normal children whowere helped by God's helpers, the angels. Even if you do notnormally read religious writing, this book is touched gentlywith a taste of joy, and it will soon become a classic youcan hold in your heart forever. Be your god Yahweh, Bhudda,or Muhamad, almost all of us answer to a higher power. Thisheartwarming book is perfect to read by yourself, with afriend, and esspesially your guardian angel."
1,Not for children,"Hi, this book may be written about children encounters with angels, but it should not be read to children. My own kids have been very in to angels lately and want to hear angel stories. So I searched for a book so I would have some bedtime angel stories to read to them. This is not the book. The stories are great for an adult to read, but I don't read my children books about parents getting murdered and angels appearing. Lots of murdering and other violent crimes and angels would appear to children. I couldn't even find one story that I didn't have to skip whole paragraphs and pages that were inappropriate."
1,"Knights are appealing, but the theology? Yikes!","I don't know if I can express my disdain for the theology expressed by this supposedly allegorical tale without spoiling the ""surprise"" of the story line. Let's just say that while my son loves the knights in the book I have a number of objections to the portrayal of the King, strongly suggested to be like God the Father. God does not send his servants into life-threatening peril as a test. He does not abandon us.Enough said."
4,Good toy for those who love to build.,"Just FYI for those who might be looking for the Black Spiderman:I ordered this toy expecting to receive the Spiderman 3 BLACK SPIDERMAN, but I did not. I received this exact set, but in the normal red/blue Spiderman.All in all, it is still a great building toy and my son is thrilled to have it."
4,"A fun toy for boys who like both Spiderman, and anything with wheels","This is a fun gift for boys aged 6-10 years old who like Spiderman and anything with wheels, the latter being a given for boys this age. This 275 piece set comes complete with a Spiderman figure, and both block and magnetic pieces to make a variety of vehicles for the web-spinning hero. A great toy for parents in which to engage their children, or for brothers to share and create new adventure rides for Spidey together. This set is not for children under six, at it has many small pieces and very young children would lack the skills and coordination necessary to build the vehicles."
4,cool product,"i bought this as a temporary substitute for central air in a 1400 square foot home. be prepared to have a special 220V electrical outlet installed if you do not already happen to have a compatible one in place. I chose to install in a window right next to the electrical service entrance, so it only cost me about $110. the installation instructions are a bit vague, so be prepared to do some heavy meditation during assembly if you haven't done this sort of thing before. also, you may need to get some caulk to squeeze in where the contour of the housing doesn't exactly meet up with the frame and the supplied foam is insufficient. this sucker is heavy, so rope a friend into helping lift or be very careful and creative with a hand truck.once installed, it performs very well, cooling very efficiently without using gobs of electricity."
1,Wrong Power Plug!,"I also had the same problem as the previous reviewer. The plug for this model is a 15Amp/230Volt which is not a standard household outlet. The Frigidaire manuals are deceiving because the images depicted in them show standard 110 outlets. I cannot say anything about the actual performance of this unit however, it may very well be a great product."
1,It broke with the fourth candle.,"We got this candleholder to burn some beeswax candles. We found the candles would burn all the way down in this candleholder until there was no wax left.However, when the fourth candle was burned down until we thought it was out, approx. 30 minutes later, the candle holder burst apart, with glass spraying around. The fragmented base still held the candle wick, which when I looked at it, was still burning.We have decided to buy a metal candlestick holder next time. This is probably something that happens very seldom, but some pieces went into our rug, and we hope we found all of them.Another family member bought this on Amazon.com by the way."
5,Excellent,"We already owned one of these pans, but my husband was adamant that that pan be ready and clean every time he needed it, which is everyday, to cook his morning oatmeal. No other pan would do. So I gave him another one for his birthday, and he loves it. It is deep and heavy, so that contents do not boil over, and is very easy to clean."
5,amazing,"what's so wrong with paying homage to classic songs by playing them similar to the originals. i was absolutely blown away by ""Bicyle Race"" and ""Us and Them"". Pink Floyd is my all-time favorite band so i was highly skeptical then pleasantly surprised by the execution. BTBAM are spot on with everything they attempted in this album. who are we to judge how they wanted to show THE ANATOMY OF how they came to play how and what they play. its blatantly obvious after listening to the album where they get all their killer ideas for arrangement and songwriting.Between the Buried and Me is amazing whether they are destroying our brains with uber-heavy metal or helping us drift away into a spacy realm of progressive fantacism. BUY ALL THEIR ALBUMS!"
4,Interesting tribute CD,"Between the Buried and Me completely changed the way that I thought about music. But, if you're reading the review for this CD, we don't need to extol their greatness here. With this CD though, I was expecting a little more. It's really great to hear such a talented band cover some of their favorite bands, but I think I was expecting more experimentation and exploration with the music. They really cover the songs exactly they way they were originally played, just with a different singer and different recording quality from the instruments. Great CD for a die-hard BTBAM fan, just a good listen for everyone else."
1,Argh!,"I've never been a huge fan of cover songs but sometimes artists do a good job creating their own interpretations. This is NOT one of those times. I won't comment on every song except to say that none of them impressed me. I will however mention the one song that made me want flip out. Faith No More's Malpractice. Angel Dust is one of my favorite albums and Malpractice is a great song in my opinion. These guys just destroyed it! My taste in music is pretty diverse and I tend to give artists a wide latitude, but this is just shameful. Stick to your own music guys, you make a crappy cover band. Maybe next time you should just put up a suggested listening list on your myspace page or something."
1,"Good stuff from a great, awesome, original, br00tal band","So I was at the local butchershop picking up my regular shipment of pig heads to devour, when one of the guys there handed me a CD from a band called Between the Buried me. Although coated in the blood of hundreds of calves, I couldnt help but pop the gore-covered CD into my radio. Boy was I blown away! I mean, these guys play br00tal, awesome, original stuff man! Hate Eternal? Whos that? Acoustic breakdowns and death growl/clean singing? Forget Opeth anyway, they obviously ripped off this fine young talented group.But anywho, I couldnt help but have a craving for rare steak after this. Maybe its reverse PETA-ology."
2,*sigh*,"I didn't truly see anything special about this item. After listening to it I decided that it really wasn't worth the money. However, I do have to give them credit for doing a great job sounding like the original vocalists (except for select songs). I didn't see any creativity in this album and it looks like it was just a way to get a little cash. Covers like Atreyu's ""You Give Love A Bad Name"" showed some creativity (regardless of whether that was my favorite cover or not). I would not recommend this album, but I most certainly would recommend their other albums (my favorite being Alaska)."
2,why,"Why do a cover album when you could make another awesome original music album. These covers are not very creative and almost all of them sound exactly the same as the original songs, so whats the point. Giles does such a good job imitating the other singers voices, there really is not much of a point to listening to this album, you've heard it all before. Alot of the songs toward the end of the album are boring and repetitive.Why, oh why did you guys waste your time making this?"
4,the bare bones,"i was a little cautious about buying this cd. With the Exception of Evergreen Terrace's ""writer's block"", most cover's albums suck. With Between The Buried and me, there are some good selections that are done quite faithfully to the original versions, but then, there are the choices that truly suck. I really don't know why Queen's ""Bicycle"" was chosen, but it does not work."
4,"Perfect for my husband, and I like it too!",This is a wonderful book for a modern father/father-to-be. It does a great job of touching on things that are important to dads from the male point of view. It covers pregnancy to toodlerhood. It isn't the most informative book but it has a lot of good info. I think it is a great book for my husband. It is very supportive of a father's role in parenting and even has sections on being a stay at home dad. The book also touches on important topics like playing video games and watching tv with a new baby. The best part is it is very funny and full of pop culture references. It is a great read and worth investing a little time and money.
2,SLow Food Movement,"I agree, definitely not enough focus on the food. Slow moving and in one hour we don't see more then 3 dishes. The chef and the restaurant is great! The film production is not."
1,Not as advertised,The unit only has one audio/video input. Specs say it has two. Verified with a Power Acoustik tech support representative that there is only one. The space on the back of the unit where the second input belongs is a plastic cover. Tech support looked in the Power Acoustik warehouse and found that all the units only have one input. The rep was not at all concerned about the misprint on their website and every other site that lists it wrong.
2,review,"I love the Zoob product line and would highly recommend it in general, but unfortunately, the remote control car did not work for us. You have to build on the main piece, which was quite heavy, so if you built out from it, the main piece would sink to the floor, not allowing the wheels to turn. It was frustrating for my son. It also would not turn left or right. We decided to return it and purchase the non-remote controlled car designer instead. He's very happy with his ""kid-powered"" version."
5,"YOWZA ! ZOWIE!! Heh heh heh ...YIKES ! Good book, 'nuff said","Grab onto those armrests Folks ! Reading ""CONTRACT NULL & VOID"" will find one clutching the armrest in suspense filled anticipation, gripping to keep from laughing oneself onto the floor, and leaning an elbow in deep thought and contemplation.DKA is a hit as an agency! A cool, calculating efficient soap opera. The world is revealed in all its glorious personalities, the hunter and prey, the fragile webs of relationships, love and hate. The insanity of given situations contrasted with cold logic of having to be so to be sane.A great tale of suspense and mystery, Gore writes in a compact hard hitting style complementing the ranks of DKA.You won't want to put it down."
4,Great book!,"I am not sure what some of these people were reading, but I thought it was an excellent book. The twist at the end was unexpected and I for one can't wait to read the next installment! Carole in Shreveport"
2,Edge of Evil,I have read and enjoyed everything J.A. Jance has written--until now. I thought the characters were wooden and unreal. All the men were jerks and all the women martyrs. I realize she was trying to make a point but the writing was not up to her usual outstanding standards and frankly her point got lost because of the blatent advocacy.
2,Potentially good plot but sloppily written,"This is a book by JA Jance? This book took a potentially good storyline (plot) and made it seem stupid because it was so simplistic in its writing style, which is UNLIKE JA Jance. This book seemed to be to be written for a young-adult reader audience.I had to force myself to read it all the way through because I must admit, I was curious as to the conclusion, but I did not derive any pleasure from reading this book. A waste of time."
4,Too many lawyers?,"Fired abruptly from her anchor position at a prominent news station for being `too old', Ali Reynolds returns to her home to learn that her best friend is dead - apparently by suicide, over a snowy mountain after a fatal medical diagnosis. Realizing she has no constraints on her time, Ali heads back to her hometown and her parents' Sugarloaf Café, where she grew up. Ali has another wonderful discovery on her way to her hometown - her marriage is over. Her husband has been cheating on her for a while, unbeknownst to her but known by most others. So, in the midst of a lawsuit against the station and divorce proceedings, Ali hunkers down in the house she inherited from her aunt, venting her frustrations and problems on a blog that her son has set up for her. Little does she suspect what ball her ruminations will set rolling. A good read, although I did set it down to finish others, first. I suspect there will be more stories with Ali."
2,Just an Ok book,I havent read a JA Jance book for a long time and saw this one at the supermarket so I bought it. I was very disappointed in it. It didnt really start to get anywhere near interesting until the last couple of chapters and then it was over.
3,If you liked the Joanna Brady series this might not be for you.,"I have just completed all the books in the Joanna Brady series. The Ali Reynolds series is a significant departure. The writing style is more on the feminine side, and does not bring out the analytical and intuitive side of the main charachter. A good fast moving read nontheless."
4,I wish Ali would get a job at the Cottonwood radio station..she wouldn't be the first Reynolds to work there,"I keep hoping the radio station gets mentioned in this series, but be that as it may, I do enjoy the Ali Reynolds stories and this first of the series is no disappointment. The byplay and conversations on her blog are especially enjoyable to me. My one objection is that the mystery does get lost among the subplots, but even so, I quite like Ali, her son, and her parents. Strongly female oriented, but as a guy, I enjoy the characters."
3,A disappointment,"This is the first novel in a new series. I usually like a J.A. Jance novel, my favorite series being the J.P. Beaumont books that are set in Seattle, Washington. This new series just didn't ""grab"" me the way her other books do. Maybe the second book will be better."
2,Edge of Evil,"Loved the characters, but the interplay on the computer was way over the top, and not very interesting. I was very disappointed, as I LOVE J.A.Jance."
2,Cut loose,"Some books never get off the ground, and Edge of Evil is one of them. The plot hinges on three debacles, TV anchorwoman Ali's ageist dismissal from her job, the death of Ali's fatally ill best friend in a car accident, and the death of Ali's own marriage. Her son talks her into starting a blog about her tribulations, and, of course, its popularity blossoms immediately. Ali uses her blog, Cutloose, as a vehicle of adjustment, and begins to see the silver lining in the clouds of her personal problems. She's convinced that her friend's death was neither suicide nor an accident, and doggedly pursues the facts while dodging violent attempts upon her own life by various sub-characters.All of this should make for an interesting thriller, but there are no thrills. There's a lot of whining, a lot of empathy, and a minor blip at the end. There are salt of the earth family members and despicable husbands. But it all adds up to light summer reading but nothing more."
3,Got me Through Two Airplane Flights,"Haven't read Jance before, and it did move pretty well, kept me involved at 35,000 feet, what can I say. This one may have been a little too P.C., what with the heroine endorsing and crusading for every group that connected with whatever happened to her recently (food service workers, Iraq soldiers, abused wives, etc.). But I will probably read more of her stuff. My sister and a good friend are rabid fans."
4,Left for Dead,"Enjoyed the book and it left me in suspense until the end. Being a native of Arizona, I can relate to the different place the author names in the book."
5,The Hand of Amun,"This is one of the best Black Lace books I have read. I rate it right up there with my other favorite, ""The Gallery"".It is steamy, but best of all it has a great story too! You don't just get a bunch of jumbled sex scenes with no story (like ""Lake of Lost Love""). You get a real story with great sex.I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Black Lace."
3,Sexual Adventures in the Ancient World,"I've read many Black Lace novels. Juliet Hastings is one of their best authors. She often writes historial novels about knights and ladies living in wonderful castles. I prefer those to this one, which is set in an ancient culture which believes in a religion based on sexual rituals. This book had a good storyline. The characters were likeable, except for the ones we are not supposed to like.This is not my favorite Black Lace novel, but it was good. If you've ever dreamt about living in ancient Egypt, you'll enjoy letting your mind explore the fantasies in this erotic novel."
3,Onward secular soldiers!,"It is clear that a great battle looms in evolutionary thought between the forces which believe that free will is an illusion and the forces which believe choice (or options-based behavior) is biologically possible. In this impending war, Gould will not become the great general he hopes to be. But he will be a valuable foot soldier."
4,"codependency, emotional violence, and domestic abuse","The overall presentation was great for group work. Although my clients were adults, the questions provided with the dvd online helped with good group conversation."
4,A to Z U2,"This is an extensive encyclopedia (just as the book title says) of everything U2. A real resource tool for the die-hard U2 fan, although it may be a bit too much for the casual U2 listener. I did find some inconsistencies though; on Larry Mullen Jr.'s bio, it says he is an only child, yet in the next paragraph, mentions 3 siblings (?). It does have some ""rare"" photos (one of Adam Clayton with a beard-whoa!), all in black and white. If you were expecting full-page color photos (like me) you may be disappointed. That would have been nice. But, if you're wondering why Naomi Campbell (yes, she's in it too) and Adam broke up, it's here. It's all here. Quite a trivia treasure of information that even ardent fans may not know. Get it if you must know EVERYTHING about the band. Some things I wish I didn't know."
5,All you ever wanted to know about U2 + MORE!,"This is my U2 Bible. It has everything you ever dreamed of knowing about U2, and it answers questions you've never even wondered about the band. It lists every single song ever recorded by the band and all the facts on them, the book has bios on all the band members, the stories of the tours, specific incidents in U2's career, and gives a wonderful history of their musical career. There is also a lot of facts about the band before they came together to form U2. I mean, how many people know all there is to know about U2? Well, read this book cover to cover, and you'll know probably more about U2 than they can remember for themselves! I used this book for a research paper on the band and used a good 50% of it as my main source! It's a must for any die-hard U2 fan. THE GOAL IS SOUL!"
5,Pre-filter for Healthmate,I was shocked at how much dust the pre-filter collected. I remove the pre-filter monthly and just vacuum it and reinstall it. The pre-filter helps your filter to last longer.I have had my HealthMate Plus for 9 years and it has literally saved my health.Sometimes I even take the pre-filter and hang it in the shower and spray it. The dirty water is in the tub. When I vacumm the pre-filter I tack the pre-filter to the wall and use a hand vac to get it dust free.
3,"I am not too crazy about it, but overall i am ok with.","can't resend Messages. i need to forward them.can't turn off message alert or voicemail alert with the mute button, i needed to wait till the entire song is done.can't arrange menu items.I am not too crazy about it, but overall i am ok with it.I love the way it sync w/ my outlook, this is my palm and phone all in one."
1,WARNING NO INTERNATIONAL ACTIVATION,"I purchased this phone since it is a GSM world band phone and I was about to travel overseas. However, when I called Cingular to activate international roaming before leaving, I was told that no new activations are offered for countries which AT&T had roaming agreements with. Thus the phone will not work in those countries. So, to make a long story short, this phone will only work in the USA until Cingular and AT&T merge their networks. This may take a long time!"
1,Please do not buy even for a 'cent',"I have had this phone for 4 months bought through amazon. I have never written reviews before but decided do one for this, because of the poor design.1. Volume is really bad outdoors, hard to hear inspite of having high volume.2. Battery recharger adaptor connection to the phone sucks big time. It became bad very soon and I already replaced as the pins in the phone for charging became bad. Once again I am having issues with the new phone. It is really a poor design like feathertouch controls. Remember I don't handle my phones rough. You can't see a scratch.anyway, please opt for other ones if you can.drb"
2,poor phone,"I bought the phone at Thankgiving. It has a lot of problem with speaker phone, poor quality camera, bad battery. I just return and exchange the new one with the dot orange box. They told me update new software. But when I bring home and try. It come out the same old problem. Terrible phone. Don't ever buy this phone. Waste your money and time to figure out and test free for them"
2,MPx220,"Windows causes the phone to stall sometimes, or respond very slowly (phone keeps ringing even though you have answered). Some smartphone apps don't work. The Motorola charger is likely to stop working after a week or so (I have had 5 of these phones). The charging pins are delicate and susceptible to bending. The phone takes forever to boot up (3 minutes or so before a call can be made). Activesync over bluetooth is very difficult to configure, however it does work well. Sometimes the bluetooth stack gets reordered for no particular reason. The camera is pretty bad indoors, but ok if there is a lot of light (think surface of the sun, ok thats a slight exaggeration). Being able to load mp3s and use them as ringtones is nice. The photo caller id is also nice."
4,I HATE this phone,"I reviewed this phone a while back and gave it 4 stars. Big mistake! I had my first MPX220 for about 7 months when suddenly, the phone decided to stop charging for me. Called Cingular and they sent me out a new one. I've had this one for about 3 weeks and the screen froze. It's now completely black on the inside and distorted on the outside display. Something tells me that Motorola tried to pack so much into this phone that it can't handle it. I never used much on the phone as far as apps. but I think i'm going to steer clear of motorola for a while."
3,Small PDA with issues,"I am using this phone for last 2 months..Pros- Small compared to many other PDA phones like Palm- Cheap compared to other PDA phones.- Easy PC syncing. I got lotus notes calendar syncedCons:- As many mentioned here the phone rattles at 75% of the volume. It does not matter the phone is on speaker or not. It rattles if you increase volume. In effect, volume is low and not clear.- Intermittent lock up. It is a good idea to reboot the phone occasionally and especially before an important call- Intermittent miss call, when you try to answer.- Low battery life"
1,After 1 year of use...,"Thank God my contract is up and I can get a different phone. I had 2 of these phones on a Cingular plan - both have problems with basic phone functions. At times I have had to try 10-15 times to try and make a call succesfully, other times calls are being sent directly to voicemail - all while my phone is on and showing 3 or more bars of reception. This has been a somewhat chronic problem that has been growing with time. I have found that some of this problem has been caused by the phone's hardware or software. When I complained to Cingular of this problem - after not being able to receive a call for 3 straight days they recommended turning the phone off and back on, which does help some of the time."
2,"Great Features, Poor Quality...","I've gone through two of these in a little over a year. The phones are known to be of poor quality. In both of mine, the volume was low (I've done the upgrade) and they phone died by not being able to recharge the battery. I have a number of chargers and while they work on other phones (with my battery) none of them will charge the battery on my phone.Expensive phone for only a year's worth of use. I know of a couple of other people who have had problems with the phone as well.Motorola outsourced the development of this phone and not only is it discontinued, but Motorola discontinued the relationship with the manufacturer and cancelled the plans for an MPX3.. series phone. This makes me think it was poor engineering since they could have had someone else manufacture the phones."
2,"Nice phone, Cingular dissapointing","It seems as though Cingular has crippled certain Bluetooth protocals in the MPX220. I bought one at BestBuy, and returned it whe I realized that I could not connect it to my computer with Bluetooth. I will be waiting for an unlocked, non Cingular branded version to purchase.As for the phone itself, well I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for Cingular. I will say that the return and cancellation process went smoothly (so far, haven't received final bill yet!)"
2,Overall unpleasant,"I was generally pretty happy with the phone. It had it's short comings but it had things I needed like syncing with my Outlook etc. I've had the phone for 8 months now and the issues I've had have outweighed any good. It drops calls. The ear piece speaker is very week and I have to use a headset. Now that I have been using a headset, I can't get the phone out of headset profile mode. That means I have to have a headset with me at all times. I have called support, tried to install the software update but to no avail. I was supposed to be sent a new phone by they are apparently on backorder... very bad sign. I'm trying to Audiovox SMT 5600 Smartphone in hope that it is better. Good luck!!"
1,Do not buy this phone.,"This phone has been a headache since day one. As seen in previous reviews, the reception goes away for no reason. I currently cannot receive calls at home because the phone loses all reception after being on for more than 5 minutes...The battery is terrible, the phone turns off consistently for no reason. The operating system is ok, it takes a long time to boot and freezes on occasion. When it freezes you have to remove the battery and restart it.The power cord no longer works unless it is attached at an angle. On and on and on... I am considering a full boycott of Motorola after my experience with this POS. I cannot believe that they are unable to manufacture a reliable compact smartphone.Do not buy this phone, you will regret it."
2,Not Great,"1 I had to have returned, the other has the following problems:-Cannot change phone from silent to normal-Cannot edit any profiles to allow it to ring-Icons popup and won't go away-Phone locks upSay goodbye to this phone."
2,Nice phone but terrible sound quality,"I agree with other reviewers that the quality of the sound from the speaker with and without the earpiece is terrible. I love the other features of the phone such as the calendar and the Outlook sync which means that my phone now carries my schedule, contacts, and tasks. The battery life is not as long as advertised if you continously open the phone and look at your schedule or call your friends. Overall I like the phone but the sound quality is an issue."
2,"terrible speaker volume , good PDA features","I have never written any review on any item. But I feel very compelled to write one this time. I loved this phone a lot but had to return it. It has everything I wanted, except the very basic feature of the phone, the speaker volume! The volume is sooo low on the earpiece, the speaker phone itself and the microphone. There is a few glitches in the software here and there. The side buttons are too big so sometime you may accidently change the setting. But I consider these are minor problems. Outlook, ActiveSync, blue tooth, Media player and everything else pretty much works fine. Despite all of these great features, the low volume is unbearable. I always love moto phones especially they have good sound systems. MPX220 is definitely NOT the one you would expect from Motorola. I'm very disappointed. I will just have to wait until they come out with a new PDA phone. By the way, the ROM version on mine is 1.30."
1,Very disappointing.,"I should have known I wasn't going to like this phone the minute I picked it up. It felt too light and ""tinny."". The sound quality was weak with and without the earpiece. The speakerphone was barely audible. Within one day the battery cover wouldn't snap back in place. Before the end of the first week, it shut down and wouldn't start again. I switched back to Verizon and bought the Samsung i600. Love it. No comparison except both have the PocketPC OS."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"The phone has lots of features but they don't live up to the price of the phone. The camera flash is weak and anything out of bright light is grainy even on a little phone screen. The speaker phone/ringer is too quiet except in the best situations. The blue tooth doesn't allow voice dialing. The phone seems to freeze up once in a while although it's not difficult to reset by popping the battery. There is a software update that has come out that may fix that but they aren't saying why you need it - just calling it a ""ROM update"" which requires a memory wiping hard reboot. The Outlook sync works fine and is the main reason I got it. I would have like the ""notes"" function of Outlook to also have been included on the phone but it's not. You have calendar, phone/contacts, and task that do sync."
5,Amazing book!,"Explains the Pledge of Allegance so that ANY age child (or adult!)can understand. I bought it to work with my ESL third graders, but I've used it for all grades including Kindergarten. Every classroom in the country should have a copy."
3,Noble try.,"The goal--nicely attempted--of breaking down each line of this too-difficult-for-the-kids-who-have-to-say-it speech falls short.While they explain the large words in kid-friendly phrases and credit Francis Bellamy, they make the significant omission of the fact that Bellamy DID NOT write the phrase ""under God,"" and that it was added without his permission. The text says, ""Many people believe that a democracyis a reflection of how God thinks..."" without mentioning that the pledge, in its current form, misquotes its author.A book that is designed to clear things up should be more accurate. Nonetheless, the illustrations are eye-catching and the language accessible to kids. It's a good idea to give them a better understanding than their often-quoted, ""I led the pigeons to the flag..."""
4,Great for the price,"I bought two of these for my 2010 Nissan Frontier to use when towing our small camping trailer. I was a little worried about how well they would stay on, since the mirror housing on a Frontier is not rectangular - it is narrower on the outside than on the inside - and it seemed like the straps could slip off. However, the straps did not move at all and worked very well. The rubber straps firmly grip the slightly textured plastic of the housing.They definitely improved visibility. Yes, there is some vibration, but it is not bad and doesn't affect your ability to see vehicles behind you. Also, the vibration doesn't seem to affect the mirror adjustment at all.There don't seem to be many options for replacement towing mirrors for the Frontier, so for me this is a great solution, especially for the price. I don't need to use them very often, and when I do they are easy to put on and take off."
1,Poor design / concept,1st time using the product and had the straps as tight as possible without snapping them. Entered the express way and first gust of wind and the mirror was gone.
5,Good for the $$$,"These mirrors cost far less than the ones we see at the RV stores and work very well. We've been afraid that the straps that hold them on will come undone, but this hasn't happened. We can't see past the camper without them. They are adjustable to any angle we want. We highly recommend these mirrors."
4,FYI,"You only get one mirror, so make sure you order two if you need two of them. Also works good for beginners, fast and easy to put on. But if you want something more stable then spend the money and get one that is designed for your mirror."
4,worth reading for liberals,"This book is worth reading for liberals and conservatives alike. I'm not, in the end, convinced that Kekes has made his case against liberalism. (I think that liberals can answer all of his charges) but he presents interesting challanges that liberals must consider. He's much more rigerous than most conservatives and actual makes arguments rather than just fighting staw men or expressing his own opinion. It's a good book both for liberals, to see what a sophisticated conservative challange to liberalism looks like, and also for conservatives who are dissatisfied with the relatively simple-minded views of someone like Kristol or Buckley (anyone who thinks that Rush Limbaugh is worth listening too will probably not be smart enough to get the book!)"
1,Worthless!,"I put this on my wedding registry years ago. Have tried to use it several times, now, and it never works right. No matter what I've tried the ""battery operated"" press just isn't powerful enough to push the dough through & out the spout. I've even modified their recipes by adding more liquids and still didn't help."
1,"Worked for a bit, then quit","My son and I tried making cookies tonight with this. I'd gotten it for a gift, and not used it till now. At first it worked okay, if slowly, then the motor just simply couldn't get enough umph to push the dough through, it kept slipping.Also, because the motor is so underpowered, they tell you to keep the dough at room temperature so that it won't be too stiff. As anybody who has made spritz cookies before knows, warm dough means the cookie details won't be crisp, and the dough won't separate well when you lift the press off the newly formed cookie."
2,"Nice, but too big","This boot looks very nice, but I wear a size 9 and ordered a 9, but it was way too big."
4,YELLOW BOOTS,VERY SATISFIED WITH SERVICE AND PRICE. ALSO FOLLOW-UPON ORDER WILL USE AGAIN WHEN NEEDED.
3,Interesting doc and sounds - awful video transfer,"Not necessarily the deepest or best organized of docs, this is nonetheless engrossing and, in view of a lack of similar material, invaluable. The generally excellent Canadian Rhombus (""32 Short Films About Glenn Gould"", a terrific film about Falla, the title of which escapes me) is behind this. However, their efforts are all but sabotaged by one of the worst film-to-video transfers I've seen. To say that there are artifacts doesn't begin to describe it. So, even though I enjoyed the film and the DTS audio transfers of 70 minutes of complete movements from Valery Gergiev's complete Shostakovich cycle, I can barely muster 3 stars because of the atrocious visual quality."
3,"Good, but does not stand alone.","Overall not a bad documentary, I'm glad I have it but if I could there are a couple of things I would add to it. Simply put its just too short. There is very little about the eight symphony and its aftermath, and therefor the ninth doesn't have its proper context. I don't believe the sixth is mentioned at all, granted it doesn't fit the theme of the DVD, but good historical research doesn't not have a theme. If this is an area of interest there are several books that are of much more value."
3,Strictly Entry Level,"Shostakovich Against Stalin makes a good enough introduction for the novice and the performance fragments are a treat, but this film presents the most superficial examination of this fascinating face-off between art and politics. While either a dramatic or analytical extrapolation of the accounts put forth by Gergiev and the various interviewees would have added intellectual texture to the film and invited repeat viewings, there may be enough here to compel the novice to study the subject and its era further. Scour the internet to view Oliver Becker and Katharina Bruner's fine television documentary Close-up Shostakovich: A Portrait, which I believe supplies some of this texture despite being slightly shorter in length. The more adventurous viewer may wish to tackle Tony Palmer's fancifully staged, yet impressively dramatized film Testimony, loosely based on Volkov's now notorious book of the same title."
2,Not that great,I was let down. I thought this video would be compelling and interesting but the comments are obvious. The filming is very ordinary and the conductor has nothing that new to say. Also they passed over some of the symphonies like the 7th. This is really a second rate item. Nothing special.
1,Lack of sound bites,"Not interested in music I can't sample. Getting burned on the ""yodeling songs of Austria and Switzerland"" which was half cowboy music has made me more cautious of what I purchase. How about installing sound bites on this one (and others) so we can hear what we're buying????"
5,hot song!,"This song was written by the people who wrote Christina's ""Genie in a Bottle"" and ""The Hardest Thing"" for 98 Degress. It is the first single from Dream, and the song is awesome. Great lyrics."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Reprint of a classic story of the backward bespeaking magical babe, and her search for her father, with the help of her Justice League compatriots. Magic, of course, features strongly, which makes her more important than said friends.Did I say evil sorceror? Yes, I did. There has to be one in a story like this. So, fishnets, top hats, bad guys, magic and heroes is a fun ride."
3,Good but great,"Ive been a Zatanna fan ever since i first read ""Identity Crisis"" and ive been collecting any books that has something to do with Zatanna. Even if she only appeared once thoughout the entire 100 pages, i bought it just because of her. When i saw this book, i literally bought it without hesitation because its all about Zatanna. I liked it at first but it gets old really fast. Im more of a modern type reader who likes modern type artwork and this book pretty much hold the Golden Age/Classic drawing which i got bored easily. Not to mention confusing at the same time. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to collect DC Comics or Zatanna (like me!) but otherwise, its nothing special."
4,Adorable doll,"Another cute doll for your child, an idea Halloween gift.I bought this a few years ago for like $5.00.This Barbie has a silvery, witch costume on, with orange accesories. The doll can be removed from the box and played with since it is not a collector's item.This doll is perfect for the collector, or for a child.4/5 stars~~Kat"
1,Never received this product!!!,"I had never received this order from them, and I emailed them about it twice with no response I made a complaint to amazon and then the people selling this product then emailed me and said that they weren't going to send it now becuase I had ""to go and make a complaint to amazon"".Do not order from these people!"
3,Well....,"Let's just say that it's not the most original story in the world. The characters aren't bad, and its a change to see things such as level limits mentioned in an AD&D novel...but apart from these, the book just hasn't got the flair of a great work!! Stick to the original book."
2,not what i expected,"I bought the phone holder after looking around a long time for something that didn't mention a magnetic clip. Why would anyone want to put a magnet by sensitive, expensive electronics anyway? But it did have a magnet and the Trio 750 fits too snugly in my opinion anyway. The car charger is the only thing that I use now."
4,Couldn't be better,"After reading some reviews of this cd, I tried to think of someway it could be better, but to no avail. This is just as good of Rock-N-Roll cd as it gets. The new singer fits in very well, & the music is really good. We don't know how long this band will be together so get this while it's still hot off the presses. You won't be disappointed."
4,still rocking after all these years,"well i'm going to get to technical like people do..if you were a cactus fan before you will love it. different voice on lead vocal thats all. everything else rocks..i, glad i stumbled on to it ."
3,Shadow of Cactus...,"I like nostalgic returns as much as the next guy, but Cactus died a long time ago. Rusty Day's absence is not just noticeable, but painfully so as it was on earlier reincarnations without him, including the ill-conceived Son of Cactus. Cactus V rocks hard enough to keep it marginally interesting, but overall the songs simply don't measure up to even the more mundane moments of their first three albums. Lacking serious material, this version of Cactus, more appropriately named Shadow of Cactus, is reduced to writing about themselves and how awesome they are according to ""Cactus Music"". Truth is, great bands never have to say so. Rest in peace, Rusty, I think it's finally over."
4,Surprisingly STRONG!!!,"In 1970/71/72 This was my band!! The raw energy they had was incredible. I'll admit i wasn't expecting much from ""V"" I WAS WRONG.Carmen's drums are a bit over the mix....and i'm a drummer, and its a little annoying. But the tunes and the playing from guys approaching 60 or older, is pretty damn amazing! This is a VERY STRONG record! I'm on my 3rd listen and i'm still very surprised. If you dig hard rocking blues type music. BUY IT!!! Tim and Jim....YOUR BOTH STILL DA MAN!!"
4,I Have Always Loved This Rare Album,"The final song, Strange Universe, does not play. Even so, I have been looking for this album for years and I am completely satisfied at getting the rest of the album at the price I paid."
3,Item arrived damaged.,The tee trainer I ordered came very quickly. In one week. Unfortunately we didn't leave for vacation until two weeks later so we had no need to blow up the tubes. The night before we left my husband blew up both tubes and by the morning on had gotten soft. We had no choice but to take them on the trip for my twin grandsons. The twins did use them but one does lose air. At this point it will be too much trouble to send it back and the twins can use them as long as we add air before a trip.
4,Swim Tube,I bought this product for my two year old who is now four. It really boosted her confidence when it came to swimming. It kept her above water and she wasn't flopping over while in it. It seemed comfortable for her to wear.She never complained of the tube bothering her. This tube blows away the swimmies sold at your local drug stores.
1,"It works, but....","We purchased this for our 14 mo old and it works, forcing her to kick her legs and move her arms to keep her face out of the water, but after the second use, the nylon cover developed a small tear. After the 4th use, there were huge holes in the nylon cover and runs all over it much like a nylon stocking runs and has holes. The cover is not adequate for the concrete or stone coping around a pool."
5,Must buy,Really excellent for the little ones. My son is 2 yrs old and this is perfect for him. It taught him the confidence to swim around without me and to learn to kick etc... I have used many others and I guarantee this one is the best for the beginner swimmers.
4,Love Love Love!,"I purchased this for my 21 month old son. He loves the pool and was super hard to hold on to as he splashes and loves to try to swim. This allows him to jump splash and get around the pool on his own (supervised, of course!) I haven't had any problems with it flipping him over upside down. The only criticism I would have is it's tight getting over his head and arms both putting on and taking off and the strap between the legs seems to wedge a bit. But great product, otherwise!"
2,Too Small,"Purchased this for my 3 1/2 yr old grandson. He is very lean but it was next to impossible to get it on. It was too short to use the under strap. When he had it on he did enjoy it as it worked very well supporting him. BUT when we had to take it off he looked like Houdini getting out of the straight jacket!! He refused to put it on again He said ""it hurts"". I had very similar trainer when my boys were young and it was great but this one has a definite design flaw."
2,Reviewing the seller rather than the product,"I haven't actually used the product yet, but I wanted to put in a warning for those purchasing this product. The Swim-tee doesn't have a size that you can choose so I looked at the weight range and my son's weight fell within that range. He is 15 months old and wearing 18 month clothing so he's not that big for his age. I also chose a blue swim-tee, which at the time was priced higher than the yellow one. When I received the product, it was yellow, not the blue one I paid more for and the size said that it was for children 4 years old and up. Luckily, my son fits in it and I thought I was going to use it sooner than I did so I thought I didn't have time to return it so I didn't. The information was very misleading and it seemed like the seller didn't pay any attention to what was purchased and just put the first thing they grabbed in the box. I would suggest more detailed information for buyers about the product."
1,Horrible products,"Pretty bad quality, not enought flotation and too small even for a baby, just a waste of money."
5,Love this item - what a lifesaver!!!,My daughter is 2.5yrs old & very daring. She loves the water & wants to be very independent. When she wears this swim vest she feels confident to do it all on her own (of course with us in the water with her). I feel comfortable with her using this product. We were using the full suit version for the last season & sad to see it go. I had no idea there was a vest version so you could imagine our excitement to receive this in the mail!Highly recommend to everyone with a small child.
2,Not very helpful..............,"I bought this item hoping it would help keep my 2-yr old afloat. I know all toddlers require constant supervision in the water but I had hoped this product would support him and I could just guide him in the water. WRONG.........I have to hold him up and watch him even more because if he slightly leans forward, his face goes in the water. Most children will not sit upright (like the picture) because they want to lean and play in the water. I do not recommend.............."
1,unsatisfied,"I was very excited to see a tube to purchase for my kids much like I remember wearing as a kid. I was very disappointed, it almost completely forces my daughters face right into the water. The one I grew up in I could jump off the ledge of the pool into the water and my head would never go under. This product seemed very unsafe, I had to hold my daughter very carefully and closely so she wouldn't swallow too much water. What a waste of money!"
4,Love this product,Love the swim trainer. I just wish it was made like the old ones without the happy strap between the legs. It does come unattached sometimes but is mostly secure.
3,Stand a little taller - by Gordon B. Hinckley,THe book arrived in a timely manner however the binding had to be glued and that was not stated on the description before we purchased it. We glued it and it is fine.
1,Received wrong battery,I placed an order for two of these CLKBP5L batteries. I received two CLKBP6M batteries instead. Hopefully Amazon/Target will make things right.
3,Lasted quite well,My dogs pulled the strings out pretty quickly. They didn't seem to play with the stick part so I add peanut butter to the ends. They like that.
3,Durable and fun toy,"My dogs absolutely love the ORKA puck, which is similar to this, so I wanted to try out a different shape. Maybe they don't chew on it as much as the puck, which must be more appealing in thickness or shape for their jaws and teeth. But they still enjoy chewing it and definitely enjoy tugging on the rope. The rubber material of the stick lasts a really long time. I have a couple of very determined chewers and they make this one last longer than just about any toy I've found. I recommend it, but try out the other shapes as well."
1,Lasted 15 Minutes,My Lab had the ropes out in <5 Minutes. The plastic part was in tiny pieces in 15 minutes. Don't waste your money on a Petstages Orka chew toy unless your dog doesn't chew.
1,Choose something else!,I bought this teething toy for my puppy and she doesn't have the slightest interest in it.
1,DESTROYED QUICKLY,BULLDOG LOVED TOY FOR ONLY ABOUT TWO HOURS WHEN IT WAS COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY DESTROYED. HE MADE QUICK WORK GETTING ALL THE ROPES OUT AND THEN PIECE OF BLUE PLASTIC MATERIAL WENT FLYING IN THE AIR.
3,Destroyed...,My pit bull destroyed this toy within a few minutes. It was smaller than I expected so perhaps if there is a larger one it may have held up better. I would instead recommend the ORKA ball which our pit bull has had for at least 3 months and it is still in one piece.
1,Horrible and Unsafe,Yesterday we purchased the Orka Stick for our 7 month old Labrador. Within 10 minutes he had torn and swallowed the end fringe from the rope and also the plastic edge of the stick. This caused him to vomit for two days straight causing us to take him to the Vet which cost us $140 in IV and other medicine. All this for a $10 toy. We've contacted the Manufacturer but don't expect much of a response.
1,Won't last,It literally took our 15 pound mixed breed less than 10 minutes to break off plastic pieces. Really poor quality.
2,"four stars for subject matter, zero style points","The author took a fascinating subject and ruined my reading experience by writing at a level of English compositional skill that I would be more likely to attribute to Freydeh, her fictional Jewish immigrant character who came to New York illiterate in English and apparently learned only the minimum she needed to survive in the years that followed."
4,I learnt a lot!,"This is an extremely interesting book, aswell as being well written. I learnt so much from this novel about the Women's Civil Right's Movement in the US, and also about key figures in this movement. Piercy has done well in keeping the characters as close to the real person as possible. Characters in this novel are wonderfully complex, and I found many of them so intriguing that I researched them afterwards.A really good historical novel."
2,Backwards!!,"I struggled thru the first half of this novel. Kept telling myself it would get better. It didn't. After being introduced to a religious zealot that I had absolutely no interest in (actually started skipping his chapters) and Victoria Woodhull (portrayed as a scam artist and early day hippie,) I hit part two and finally called it quits. Why? Not only was I not enjoying or getting a feel for any of its characters (the exception being the Russian immigrant Freydeh. She alone has kept this novel from being one star) but the novel is chronologically backwards like Star Wars. Part two goes back 16 years all of a sudden. It jumps to 1862 and then to 1847 and back up a bit to 1854 so not only do you have to keep track of who is who, but also what year they are in. If I have to draw a timeline, I am not going to enjoy the story."
3,Decent but should be more thoughtful,"The product was in decent condition, except at first I did not know how to open the package. It took me quite an effort to find out and open it. The item arrived three days later than the expected date. I suppose this is not the sender's fault though. I'liked the discount offer that came with the product."
4,Koopa is Back!,"Besides the live action scenes, this is one of the best cartoons. Koopa is a vampire and the Mario Gang is trapped in his castle!"
3,nice photos,"I thought there would be more family photos, so, I was disappointed. But, the photos are nice."
2,Maybe I Should Have Given It Three But....,"I became interested in Linda McCartney after seeing the TV movie about her. I think as a mother,wife,cook and friend she was terrific. But as an amateur photographer I am not that impressed by her pictures. Are the rave reviews as one reader suggests because she is ""Linda McCartney""? If she was Linda Doe would the accolades still apply? I feel like I am looking at friend's photo albums.The most famous photo (not counting Linda's 60's) is the one of Paul holding infant Mary. It's a cute photo, in fact I have similar ones with my kids, but because we are not famous no one is telling me to publish a book and quite frankly I take really good pictures as good as Linda's. I guess it is in the eye of the beholder, this is a review and being honest I would take it from the library and not buy it."
5,A must have for any Bugs Bunny fan!,"Part of the golden jubilee collection, this typifies the humor so unique to Bugs. Includes Long Haired Hare (bout with Giovanni Jones - opera singer), Bunny Hugged (boxing match with - - The Crusher!), The Grey Hounded Hare (Bugs saves a fake rabbit at the dog track), Roman Legion Hare (lesser seen Yosemite Sam/lions - not Pete Puma), Hare Do, Bully for Bugs (bugs as a bull fighter - VERY funny animation and script), Ali Baba Bunny (along w/ Daffy Duck stumbles into treasure cave -""It's mine, all mine! Down down down, go go go."", and Duck!Rabbit!Duck! - where Bugs continually outwits Daffy in a fight to keep from being shot with such phrases as ""If it's duck season, I'm a mongoose"" whereby Bugs holds up ""Mongoose Season"" and Elmer shoots the duck.All classic and very entertaining for adults - and kids too. :)"
5,What's Up Doc?,"Bugs Bunny has been well known as a icon in the hearts of all kids, of all ages alike. This collection remains as no acception. Bugs Bunny's Wacky Adventures was the very first collection to highlight that cwazy wabbit. Released in 1985, this collection was part of Warner brothers Golden Jubilee 24 Karat Collection.Each of the cartoon showcases the different styles and villians of Bugs's career. From Daffy Duck (Ali Baba Bunny and Duck! Rabbit! Duck!) to Yosemite Sam (Roman Legion Hare), a crazy bull (Bully For Bugs), and even Elmer Fudd (Hare Do and Duck! Rabbit! Duck!) this collection shows them all.Considering that many of these old cartoon collections aren't around to purchase anymore, or even rent, Bugs Bunny's Wacky Adventures remains as one worth having around, from one of the greatest cartoon characters of all time. And that is the truth Doc."
2,another one...,"This book was just another Highland-romance, pretty American meets Scottish duke, type book. It wasn't really funny/interesting/sexy. By the time the pair gets into bed, you don't care anymore. The Duke has the worst mood swings, and ""his"" Juliet is just boring. If you're looking to just pass another 4 hours of your life- then this is the book. If you have more interesting things to do with your time and you want a good romance: pick up any of Eloisa James's books, they are all good.Enjoy!"
5,KUDOS TO JLAB!,I ordered the miniblaster (2nd generation) for my husband for Christmas and it has incredible sound. I wanted to keep it for myself! The sound was awesome for such a compact portable unit. I thought he could use it while getting ready for work and bouncing from room to room w/o hooking and unhooking his IPod Nano. I love the fact it also comes w/ an adapter to save battery life. I just wish it came in other colors.....great job and great price. I can't wait till this Summer and try it at the beach!
2,Too much money for so little quality,"If the sound quality that you're looking for can be equated with an old mini-transitor radio, you might be pleased. Even so, you would probably expect to pay around $15 for the product - not something in the $40 plus range! Like another reviewer, I had very low expectations for such small speakers but apparently not low enough. The speakers cannot handle bass at all and to avoid complete sound distortion you need to keep the volume very low which essentially forces you to literally be within a foot or two of the unit. Furthermore, there's no easy way to retreive your ipod once inserted! I feel I have been deceived by the 5 star reviews I used to make my purchasing decision and felt obligated to respond. The Miniblaster is a good concept poorly executed and I'm afraid I wasted my money."
4,small is beautiful,"Don't expect great sound. But it works, it goes anywhere, and it's fairly cheap. For taking your iTunes, etc. with you, and getting it out there a bit (small room size coverage, nothing more), nothing like it."
5,Great product!,"This is a great product. I think the sound quality is excellent for the size. I mainly listen to acoustic music - bluegrass, blues, folk and the like - so can't speak specifically to rappers and others wanting a heavy, boomy bass.I take mine to guitar/mandolin lessons to play songs that I want to learn for my teacher. Also, I can upload lessons we've recorded to the ipod and play them back, all on a portable speaker that fits easily in my instrument case or purse.I haven't been gentle with the unit, and it's holding up very well.I seem to remember when I first got it having problems fitting the nano into the silicon skin and then the speakers. I just had to tinker around with it at first, and eventually it easily went into and came out of the speaker cabinet.If I ever broke it and another wasn't available, I would be very sad because I haven't found anything else out there like it.Highly recommended!"
3,Nice speakers,nice little speakers for the price. Good service too. They shipped and we got it right away.Steve
1,terrible fit,None of the 3 silicone ear pieces would fit in my ears. Never had a similar problem with any other earphones I have owned. Even the smallest size is close to 3/4 of an inch in diameter and they are hard and not very flexible.You need huge ear canals to use these things and sound quality is poor when they don't fit properly.Would not recommend these to anyone unless they can comfortably fit a medium size olive in their ears!
1,SAVE UR MONEY,"Upon the arrival of my new headphones i was excited. Beautiful packaging and the presentation of the look of the headphones lead me to believe i was in for a treat. Wrong, disapointment from the start. Rubber insert very unconfortable and the sound is so trashy sounding i wonder how can altec lansing put there name on this product. Air plane headphones have more quality sound than these. No exageration at all. If u read this review please do not wast ur hard earned money on the headphones. Very dissapointing!!Altec Lansing UHP301 Snugfit Earbuds w/ Silicone Ear Pads"
2,Sound and fit is sub par.,They don't fit in the ear with the provided ear pads. The sound is tinny. The earbuds provided on airplanes have the same sound quality.
4,OK PRETTY GOOD,"THIS ALBUM WAS PRETTY DOPE...SOME OF THE PRODUCTION WAS KINDA WACK...NOT THE PETE ROCK OR PREMIER TRACKS OF COURSE...AND ILL BILL GOT SOME SKILLZ TOO, BUT SOME OF IT WAS LACKING. BUT STILL A GREAT EFFORT"
2,OK,"I was surprisingly not impressed with Non-Phixion's debut album despite being a huge fan of underground hip-hop. There are a lot of top notch producers on this one, including Premier and Large Professor who also just happen to put out two of the best tracks. Overall the production is pretty good, but not really that original compared to a lot of material on the underground scene nowadays. Lyrically, the group is only above average and really fail to standout with a ""futuristic"" and violent gangsta rap style.Don't get me wrong, this album is better than 99% of the material on the recent hip-hop market, but that really isn't saying a lot."
3,Gat to your head,"Overall, the CD was not that impressive to me.The flows were not that fluid or rehearsed andsound strained at times. I didn't especiallylike the voices either, coupled with the CD'sproduction, the mood was energetic and harshrather than smooth and fluid. I'm not toofamiliar with the artists, however so I'm toblame for not liking that.However, the production leaves much to bedesired in my opinion - as well as the flows.There is a lot of meaningless gangsta content,which I constitute as lyrical filler ratherthan pleasing meaning.Not a bad CD... but def not more than 3 starsif you ask me. I think it might be the leastrotated CD in my collection."
1,wack,"Wack. I love hip hop. Especially underground hip hop. This is an example of repetitive/vulgar for the sake of being vulgar/quinisential wannabe commercial artistry possible. Wack. Ill Bill has some underground merit. And occassionally a line might strike you as slightly clever...But political commentary from these guy's? c'mon. This ish is the inverse of conscious hip hop, which isn't always a bad thing, but all it has is gimmicks...Try Cage, he's the originator and the master of what they're trying to do. I can't believe I looked forward to this release."
1,Another Eminem but not tight,"I'm rating this a one, because nothing on this was original or even good. It took 4 guys to imitate Eminem and a few other rappers. These guys are some drug addicts that think they are living some extraterrestrial fantasy, not to say they possess a paranoia for the CIA (Maybe they don't know the difference between the CIA and FBI anyhow this paranoia has fake thugs written stamped and signed all over it). The beats are mediocre, and fail to stimulate anything but a Head Ache. There's one good thing about the album the girl on the inside cover book. Bottom line save your money and don't buy this."
4,"Not quite a classic, but damn close","Group together some of the best producers and tightest MC's and New York and what do you expect happens? Ill Bill, Goretex, and Sabac Red hold it down with absolutely banging beats from Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Necro, and other greats. Some just terrible tracks keep this from getting 5 stars (Strange Universe is among the weakest tracks I have ever heard) but this stayed in my CD player for weeks and is still in rotation.Ill Bill's solo CD is hot too, if you like this cop that too."
3,It is only and ok cd,"This is an ok cd I listened to this cd before and thought it was good but when I listened to it I only liked some of the songs, the songs that are good are really good but the rest is only mediocre. Before yup get this cd get cunninlyguists will rap for food it is one of my favorite underground cd."
5,The Cult Leaders,"Simply the greatest rap group out now and individually ill bill, gore, or sabac could put out solo joints with no guests and blow everybody out the water. don't sleepwalk on this one unclehowie.com, get it creeps!"
2,Painful to read,"He has always been one of my favorite authors. But the books near the end of his career just don't make it. The main activity thru out the book, over and over again, is people getting a drink of whisky. Why would any author think this was interesting to the reader. You have a to very patient to read this book. It is work. The story line is very good, I was expecting a much better telling of this story line than I received. Anyone who was not a die-hard fan of Alistar would not make it thru this book. This is not Ice Station Zebra or any one of his books from the 60s. I ran into the alcohol obsession in another of his books, I think it was Floodgate. I recomend passing, unless you just love the authors other works."
1,Careful - Cable does not have strain reliefs,The cable does not have strain reliefs on the plug or socket. The wire broke off the solder joints one week after I received it. You will need to add strain reliefs to prevent breakage. But you will need a solder sucker to get the lump of solder off the terminal first.This is poor engineering.
1,AVOID THIS SELLER,Bought 2 to have a back-up. Both fell apart within a week. Seller didn't respond when I wrote to complain. AVOID THIS SELLER!!!
1,cheap and unreliable,"I bought this as a replacement for a PC GPS that burnt out after several years of hard use, and this one just does not cut it. It tends to lose lock with the sats very easily, the position it does give is often running 100+ meters off (for those that know what it means, I think the thing is usually pulling a FOM 6 or 8... wide margin of error), and the body is so cheaply made that after a month, the case has split.Get something else for your GPS needs."
3,"did not work for me, but...","it might for you. I tried using it on Vista, and no go. However, I downloaded a driver from US Global, and that worked, for a while. Vista is just to weird a system for things this out of date. For XP or earlier, it would probably be ok. I finally had to return it to Amazon because I grew tired of always hunting for it."
3,slow boat to nowhere,I didnt realize it had a magnet mount built in . Not a good thing on a boat as the magnet may interfer with the accuracy of the boat compass . the info on the unit doesnt tell what kind of mount it has. it also has a hard time acquiring the signals from the satellites and only locks onto 3 out of 11 sats.
5,works fine!,"It's a low cost gps solution. I use it on my small laptop while I'm going on a trip. It works fine, easy to use with map point/Microsoft st&tp.;I saw it on a police patrol car, which it can tell AmbiCom GPS-USB is able to provide the accurate gps position for our police officer to do their job."
4,Outback Brides,"Same basic concept of man and woman meeting and not admitting that they have feelings for one another when we, the readers, know that they are madly in love. Clare is a city girl who goes to the outback to find the father of her sisters baby. Clare promised her sister before she died that she would find this man. When Clare gets to the Outback she does not find Jack, who is out of town, but finds his brother Gray. Clare and Gray live together and take care of the baby while Jack is trying to be found. They both love each other, but refuse to admit it. The story is basically about their feelings for one another and their stubborness to admit that those feelings exist. I knew nothing about the Outback and felt the same way that Clare did. Clare could not see herself living there on a regular basis and leaving behind the city life. It was an interesting book."
5,Great,"We are using this book in my Policing and Psychology course, and it is such a fascinating read. Very insightful and really shines a new light on policing and the stresses that are involved with it. Its not all showing off the badge and chasing the bad guys. Great book"
1,Very unsatisfied,I am very dissatisfied with my order. I ordered the book more than a month ago and have not received it yet!
4,I love a Cop,"The book is a decent read, one of the only like it. Coming into the world of cops as a mother of one, it really hit home of what could happen.It would be an excellent book for a spouse of a police officer in order to know what to expect.Thank you."
4,Pratical handbook,"My 18 year old son is thinking about becoming a cop. I was quite suprised and a little taken aback when he declared the interest.About the same time I bumped into the author of this book at a chance meeting and ordered it. Both he and I read it. It is an excellent rundown of the very real challenges cops and their families face, full of tools for how to deal with each one.As part of reading the book and discussing it with my son I have come to terms with his current career choice."
2,Should be required reading for rookies and veterans alike!,"I'm a veteran street cop in Southern California with over 20 years on The Job. After most of those years had gone by I finally figured out some of what Dr.Kirschman writes about, but ""if I only knew then what I know now"" after reading her book, it may have saved me years of floundering. This book will give every new cop and their significant others an insightful look at most of the minefields of policework. When walking into those minefields inevitably happens and they blow up in your face, reading this book may help negotiate a safe return to the ""real world."" It will also help me as a Field Training Officer help my young rookies through some those tough patches that will be put in their path. I'm going to give a copy of this book to every new rookie I train and require it be read."
5,Nice shirt,"This is a nice shirt, especially at the cost. It has a good weight to it and is very soft and comfortable, even after several trips through the washer. Plus the Block I lets me show my neighbors in PA just where Champaign is."
3,"good phone for the kitchen, not the den or bedroom",Overall i like this phone. However it does have some drawbacks. 1) YOU CANNOT TURN OFF THE RINGER a big drawback if you bring the phone in your bedroom. 2) sometimes it gets high pitch feedback from the headset plug not making great contact. 3) the volume control does not go high enough for anyone with hearing problems. ON THE PLUS SIDE 1) long battery life 2) good headset with lots of different ways to wear it. 3) great reception
4,second time's the charm,"The first week after i got it it worked wonders. Then the person you were talking to couldn't here you. I called the tech support line and they triend to figure out what was wrong, they couldn't. So i sent it back to Plantronics(because the telephone comes w/ a 2 year waranty) and they sent me a new one no questins asked. I was really surprized w/ their cooperation. The second one has working for about a month now."
1,Caution !,"Ad mis-leading. Shows handset with dial-pad. Unit has label on it saying ""this is NOT a handset"" ! Do not recommend this phone...."
3,"It's ok, not the best though","For one, not digital. That means that the reception quality varies greatly. Some 50 feet from the base and mine begins to fade. Manu. claims 150 ft. When it's in range, very few complaints. You hear the caller very well.You cannot mute your voice, however. You cannot shut off the ringer. Bedrooms are not good for this phone for that reason. And you cannot use the phone as a stand-alone phone without the headset.Callers hear a drop-off in sound quality when you use this phone over a handheld phone. Some callers tell me, ""sounds fine."" Others say it sounds as though I'm in a tunnel, or as though I'm on a celluar.Knowing this, for [the price] it is a great value. For the [price] it costs at the Plantronics web site it should be criminal. If your conversations depend upon critical sound quality, look elsewhere (digital phones, dss, or 2.4 mHz). For telling telemarketers to leave you alone, it's fine."
4,WAIT! Just consider the CT-10,"I love the phone but I have to stop you. The recently released CT-10 (one model up) is so superior that you should at least consider it. It about $40 more but the improvements are vast. This is a good inexpensive alternative and none of the competitve models compare. However, the CT-10 has much better battery life (5+hrs), a much smaller hand set (smaller than a deck of cards), a holder for the headset on the base, a clip for the cord (otherwise the jack wears out overtime for the movement), and a gradiated volume control (not just loud/soft). I think it is worth the upgrade if you will be using this regularly."
2,Disappointed...,"One of the reasons I bought this product was because I am familiar with Plantronics in the office. The phone itself is quite clear in my opinion and the headset is comfortable. However I am disappointed because there is not a mute button. Also, when the battery is low the phone only beeps once, it is not very loud and you have less than a minute to get another phone. I have dropped 3 calls because of the battery including one conference call while working from home."
5,wolo talking back up alarm,This product is awesome. I put it on our golf cart that we use at camp and I get more comments about this.. People want to know where to get one and they want one for their cars... Its very easy to install.. On a golf cart you just unplug the back up buzzer that is on it and wire this one in.. I drilled 1 small hole in the plastic inner shell of the golf cart and attached it... ...Just love it and so does my granddaughter !!!!!
4,Attention Getter!,"This back up alarm, on my wife's Town & Country, really gets attention....often too much. The alarm is really loud and obnoxious (a plus in my book). My wife had me put electrical tape over the speaker to mute it a bit. It was easy to install (about 20 minutes with hand tools). Overall, we are satisfied."
4,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FULLY!,"After reading two comments, I taught i will get this item I always wanted after hearing a uncle of mine who had one years ago. Its okay but I don't find it LOUD ENOUGH. Maybe if the place is dead quiet but in a busy street or main road, someone has to be real close to hear it. If the place is very quiet like a residential neighborhood, neighbors outside would certainly here it. I'll rate this a 7 out of 10."
1,Battery Review,The battery came fast. Problem is battery was ordered from me by my grandson. Have to send it abroad and battery doesn't charge fully.
3,Fourth Grader Review,My favorite word was abasement. Abasement is my favorite word because I like the word basement. The word abasement means your going down lower. The way I know is because of a story in Weighy Words. A man was working in his office on the top office. He kept on going lower and lower untill he was in a basement.
5,Getting Through to Teens,"I saw this book on another teacher's desk and picked it up. After reading one passage, I knew that I HAD to order it right away as a tool to teach SAT vocabulary. My students love it and are soaking in the information. Finally, a book that is able to get through to teens has arrived!"
5,Gina's Great Discovery,I really love this book! It is so awesome! Every day my teacher reads us ONLY one story a day. It is so cool how this book tells me what some of the most unusual words mean. Two of the words the book has in it are: ingratiate and juxtapose. I am not going to tell you what the words mean because I don't want to spoil the great suprise of reading it on your own. This book is so unpredictable that even if you think you know what it is you most likely would not get it exactly right. I love this book and hope you take my advice and read this fabulous book!
5,love the cookware,"We are not professional chefs. But for our everyday use, this cookware is excellent. It has cool handles, a quick warm up and is easy to clean. We purchased the 13 piece set and were so pleased we added the 7 piece set and the 101/2 inch and 11 inch skillets. We highly recommend."
3,"Use gently, then figure out how to clean!","I purchased the 13-piece stainless set without realizing how carefully the pieces would need to be used and cared for. While it's rarely wise to use high heat on the range top, doing so will definitely create an indelible mark in these pans. Also, minerals in the water that I wash these pans with tends to leave a rainbow appearance inside of them which I find undesirable. I am learning to clean them by trial and error. I have enjoyed the most cleaning success with Bon Ami, a gentle cleansing powder located near Comet cleanser in grocery stores. While I'm a faithful Cuisinart fan, I regret not holding out for some good Calphalon non-stick cookware. On a final note, it sure is BEAUTIFUL suspended from the pot rack in my kitchen!"
1,My First Book About New York,I bought this book for my grand daughter because she was very excited about her upcoming trip to New York. I am from N. Y. and I was disappointed with this book.
5,Can't live without them,"My husband was easily catching colds which then would turn into bronchitis. A friend with the same problem recommended these specific vitamins two winters ago and he hasn't been sick with more than a mild cold since (Knock on wood?). He takes one of each in the morning and one of each in the evening. He swears his immunity system is much stronger and I believe it. He doesn't catch a cold every time we see one of our grandkids. The pills are pretty big but he doesn't have a problem swallowing them. For him, they have been worth the price."
3,these are ok,"good vitamins, I just bought them by mistake, thought they were the next level up, but am liking them so far."
4,An illuminating book on a crucial film decade,"Writer Ethan Mordden examines several controversial films of the 1960s -- a decade where the filmmaker boldly attacked subjects on screen that previously had been too shocking or taboo, but now were commercially viable; even acceptable. The book covers films such as Midnight Cowboy, The Wild Bunch, Psycho, The Graduate, The Manchurian Candidate, and Dr. Strangelove."
5,Marley Magic,"This is a great moment for Bob Marley fans. Ziggy,Julian,Steve and Damian was excelent. This is a collection item for sure, a must have video. Jah Live. E-Mail me connasist@uswest.net"
3,NUFF repsect!!! its works 4 me!!!!,"I read a couple of reviews about this dvd and had to respond. no this is not the greatest concert flim, but its works for me. there is not enough reggae concert flims around, so i won't be that super critcial. Julian and Damian's energy can be felt, and keep in mind they are much better performers now ! this flim is in 1996!! they have grown! its was good to see Ziggy and the Melody Makers, and Rita looked like she was truly having fun. ok the low point was Yvad!!! he should have been the opener. low energy from him and I just didn't feel the songsbuy this for a true reggae fanhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/kymaniandmarleyfamilyfans/"
2,NOT magic Marley,"This dvd is an insult to the memory of Bob Marley. It is an attempt of the Marley family to cash in a few dollars using Bob's legacy. The members of the family do not have any talent as singers nor musicians with the exeption of Rita and Ziggy, the rest is just forgettable. If you want to hear good Marley reggae just go to your local reggae bar and I assure you will be more satisfied..."
1,Wrong part,"Wrong part...no possible way these wires would fit. Out of the six, maybe two would have been long enough, but the plug boots are too short also, they would have been in direct contact with the exhaust manifold."
3,Did NOT Stand the Test of Time,"I find that most romances can withstand the test of time, no matter when they were written. And this story line should hold up more than most since I see this idea used a lot. But for some reason as I was reading the Kindle version of this 10 year old book - it just felt dated to me.As I said I see this idea used a lot -two people secretly in love with each other, a marriage of convenience, a blue collar worker with millions in the bank, or standing to inherit millions...this is a tried and true formula. I just don't think that Ms. Hughes had her heart in it like she does with her other series - like her Kate Holly series; which I really hope has some more books coming out soon...This wasn't a horrid read, it was just a little old-fashioned and a tad trite."
3,I love the Chipmunks but this album was terrible!,Why you ask? I could barely hear the chipmunks over the music! I had to crank the volume up WAY loud and I could still barely hear the chipmunks over the music. I have listned to another Chipmunks Christmas album and had no problem hearing them at all. But this one was bad. Sad as I love the chipmunks even though I am an adult!
5,A great christmas collection that fills your heart with joy,"I think that this cd is soooo GREAT!! after listening to a few songs, your heart will be filled with joy and the christmas spirit. I especially liked the song "" Christmas don't be late"". It was funny in the beginning and the middle when the man was talking to Alvin and Alvin wasn't paying attention and the man had to scream his name to get Alvin's attention. hehe haha. :-DIF YOU ARE WONDERING IF YOU WANT TO GET THIS CD. YES!!DO. ITS THE BEST!!!!it is soooo christmasy"
3,SO SO,"This Blue Oyster Cult spin-off sounds suspiciously like Talking Heads meets Patty Smith. Hmmm? Funny at times (like Byrne), with clipped female vocals (a'la Smith), I wouldn't say it's bad, I wouldn't say it's good; I just wouldn't say. Pass."
4,Nicely flavored baked beans,"Bush's Baked Beans is a standard adjunct to my grilling efforts for meals. The basic baked beans go nicely with grilled food. Even tastier, though, is this variation on the baked bean theme--maple cured bacon baked beans. The maple and bacon flavors add a delicious edge to the flavor.Better yet, the beans are high in fiber and low in fat (even with bacon flavoring). The one downside--a high level of sodium.Still and all, I will continue to use this as a nice side dish when I grill foods."
3,Tepid tea.,"With a special needs son, an abandoned niece and a job managing the local newspaper, Marilee James had little time to think about herself. Tate Holloway with his ideas about modern technology and old fashioned love, came to Valentine to take over the newspaper, but he soon found himself becoming more and more involved in Marilee's life. Problem is, Marilee had been engaged to Parker Lindsey. Though the down-home atmosphere in this book is charming, other aspects of the book fall flat. The slow pacing is rather awkward, and much of the characterization centers on the supporting cast rather than Marilee and Tate. The most endearing characters in the book are Marilee's son Willie Lee and his constant canine companion Munro."
2,A Bland Novel,The plot was too convulted. The main characters were too generalized. By the time I finish reading the book I found I didn't care about the main character and person she fell in love with. or about the ending. I'm sorry this was not enjoyable.
4,Cold Tea was wonderful for Me,Curtiss Ann Matlock writes as though she lived the lives in this book. She writes from the heart and not the garbage that sells a cheap paperback. Instead many characters have interaction. She walks through the life of a caring and dependable newspaper woman named Marilee that not only has a handicapped child but also the life of her young niece in her hands. I enjoyed this book for it also had the characters being dependent upon God and knowing He is real in their lives.
4,FOR FUN,"I am an English teacher and I adored this book. For summer reading this book is perfect. The story moves along and is light enough to not cause the reader any stress... I found the characters to be likable and clearly formed. Though I have absolutely nothing in common with the main charater, Marilee, I connected with her. If you need to read something to get your mind off of something upsetting in your current life, this book will ease your mind with its sweetness. Pardon the pun. Enjoy...remember- READING SHOULD BE FUN!!"
4,Easy read - Fun read,"This is the first Matlock book I have read. I understand that it is a ""return"" to Valentine, OK. The story is a good representation of life in a small town and an enjoyable romantic story of unrequited love. It is an easy read (uncomplicated plot) and is fun to read (life in a small southern town). I keep it in my personal library to re-read."
4,Slow start but worth it.,"The title intrigued me, so I gave it a chance. The first chapter, when the author introduces the characters, was more like casting directions in a screenplay. Too much information to process as we go down the street describing each of the players. After that the story begins to develop and the characters fill out and you're hooked. Throughout the book I kept seeing it as a movie, on the order of Hope Floats--a gentle, satisfying romance between two people you grow to like. I especially like the way Ms. Matlock shows the spiritual side of her characters without preaching. This is a realistic presentation of people who live in small towns--their belief in God is woven into the very fabric of daily life. This is a great summer read -- make yourself a pitcher of iced tea and enjoy."
1,Boring,"I don't know if I missed something here with this book since alot of the other reviews gave it high marks. This book was slow moving from the get-go and I had a real hard time finishing it. Too many characters to keep track of. If I had to hear Tate Holloway say ""By Golly"" one more time I was going to scream. To me it is just not worth the money, get it at the library if you can."
2,One-hit wonder,"They were living of their other soundtrack, and this is just not as good. If you want to buy one, buy their other CD."
2,What a sad way to write a memoir about a son.,"Having been an INXS fan for many years, I was excited to read about the background behind Michael Hutchence. Unfortunately the authors of this book want to rant and rave about how angelic they are with regards to Michael's demise and their internal family disputes. It seemed like they just wanted to smear anyone who they had a battle with during the whole suicide controversy. In addition, they were trying to paint how high society thier life has been throughout the years. Who cares!! They wrote a book entitled the ""The Real Story Behind Michael Hutchence"", but it should have been titled ""The Real Story Behind Michael Hutchence, Tina Hutchence, and Patricia Glassop"". I would say 35% of the book is interesting facts/stories about Michael, and the rest is National Enquirer garbage. My condolense to Michael, to have his family write such an awful tribute is very sad indeed."
3,InXs,"As a major fan of Inxs i purchased this book more out of curiosity than anything else. I enjoyed the style of writing and the pace. I was a bit dissapointed with all prose on the ""family bickering"" but realise that setting the record straight was a major motivation for writing the book. All in all a good insight into Michael's life . For those who are searching for a approach into the bands life as opposed to just Micheael's than don't bother with this one."
4,Interesting Insight,"I found the book interesting, and also upsetting regarding the shabby way the family was treated after Michael's death. It is a highly personal account regarding family buisness. There are a fair number of photos, 'tho I think that they would have been better if put in chronological order, less mixed up.I do not agree that the authors should have 'kept it to themselves' - If you're constantly lied about and slagged-off in the Press, it's understandable that you should want to put the record straight.The book was finnished before Ms Yates' death, which though tragic does not automatically turn her into a Saint beyond reproach."
5,"Great watch, though it is now dead...","I have worn this watch nonstop for the last 3 years and it has had a hard life on my wrist! It is scratched and battered, but it keeps going and water has still not gotten into it like other watches I have worn. This is a great thing since I am a fishing guide and need a watch that can keep up with me. Unfortunately, the battery is now dead and I haven't gotten around to getting it changed out, but believe me, I will! Also, be sure to set the watch to your time zone and latitude/longitude in order for the fishing function to be more accurate."
4,actually works,"once you set the watch for your location the fish feeding indicator is fairly close. I fish daily and have been watching it for 2 months now. with the exception of changes in barometric preasure the watch calculates top feeding times and seems to nail it within 30 min, if they had included a barometer in the watch and cross referenced it to the moon phase it would have been near perfect. the few times it has been off were due to obvious preasure changes, if your lucky enough to be out while the preasure is falling before a storm and the moon phase says dinner time for trout you'll have a fish every other cast or so. I'd give it 5 stars but the light could be better (it works, but barely) and the band size (12mm or 13mm I think) makes finding replacement bands difficult, considering what the watch is for it would be nice to have a more secure band like the double wrap or nato style bands but unfortunately they don't come that small."
4,Excellent watch! Everything is great except illumination,This watch is great! Everything about it is what I expected and I highly recommend it. Only downside is that the night light illumination is horrible. Can barely see the hands on the analog clock and definitely can't see the digital screen in darkness.
2,The Watch Is To Small,"The fish forecast and digital date portion of the watch is to small to read. The light does not illuminate the lower portion of the watch and the images are just to small to see in bright sunshine, little chance to read them at night or in low light conditions. The band is also small. I'm not a big guy, but the band just barely fits in the first hole. Once set the fish forecast was accurate, but I needed a magnifying glass to see the fish."
5,Great call,"Love this call. It's nice and soft. Sounds great, but don't try to blow it loud. It's meant to be soft. Nice compliment to my lanyard for some variety..."
1,"""Same book, different cover!""","I was most impressed with Wells' previous series ""The Book of the Kingdoms"" and the ""Godwars."" So therefore I was eager to read his newest book. I thought I would be taken on another thrilling ride, I was most disappointed. This book for all intents and purposes is a rehashing of the other series, particularly Godwars. Here we have a noble fleeing from his/her troubles with a guardian/protector and being presued by a sorcerer/wizard, we encounter waring clans who are not united, we get past them learn what our magical talent is, use it to solve our problems then triumph. It would have been easier and more accepted, if Wells had just tacked this book onto one of his other series. His style of writing hasn't even changed any. I think that next time, if there is a next time, I will examine his book more thoroughly before I decide to buy it. A great disappointment from a promising author."
2,Could have been better.,"I was really impressed with Wells' Lords of the Sky, but was somewhat disappointed with The Guardian. It seemed that the odds against the main characters kept on getting higher and higher and they would repeatedly say: ""Why don't we just give up?"" But of course they wouldn't. They would figure out someway to overcome their obstacles. Overall, well written, but predictable."
3,Interesting,"I liked this book, but from reading other reviews, i guess you have to read this before reading his other books. This is my first book by Angus Wells, and maybe that is why it did not seem repetitve to me. I think the character Gailard was a bit puppyish, running after master Shara and being quite obviously destined for her, as I felt when I read the books blurb. Also, Ellyn isn't really spoiled at all, belying the potential humor the blurb offers. Still, the story is well put together and makes sense for the most part."
3,Hijacked: Flight 285,"This is a very good Movie that was filmed In Tucson, AZ. It was made for TV but lots of great action! I was the Location Manager for this movie and feel that I found some great locations. Hard to believe that all the interiors of the airplane pilots cabin was filmed in a warehouse in downtown Tucson. All the actors did a great job and the pace of the movie was very fast. It kept one actually sitting on the edge of their seats."
3,it's okay,"I don't know if it's a real perfume, it looks like a lot of alcohol. Don't stick on your skin for the rest of the day."
3,Not true to size,"I love this set. But its definately not true to size. I have fairly small fingers. I wanted to wear it as a right hand ring, which I am a 7. 6 1/2 on my left hand. It does not fit on my right hand finger, only on my left. Very disappointing, because I wear a promise ring on my left hand. If I want to wear this set, I'll have to remove my promise ring which I haven't done in the 8 months that I've owned it :("
2,tarnished,I ordered this ring for myself. I'm glad that I didn't have it shipped to someone for a gift. The packaging was nice but the ring itself was tarnished. It was dark gray with spots of silver. It looked like a cheap ring you get out of a bubble gum machine for a quarter! I didn't want to hassle with returning it so I cleaned it with Tarnex. It looked much better but still did not look like the picture advertised. I will return it if it turns my finger green while wearing it. I am very dissapointed with this product.
2,The goodguys have straw for brains,"Predictable. Non-satisfying climax. There are a couple of characters that are so positively dumb, you just want to slap the sh** out of them. Don't base your opinion of Rex Stout on this book. It reads fast but you'll just end up frustrated with the events."
4,Too many watches? Never!,"The catalog is a good overview of the many watches available and typically highlights the newest watches of the various watch companies. Additionally, it does include some basic information on watch movements, a glossary of watch terms, and watch company website info.My only minor complaint is as the catalog continues to add more watch brands each year, the write-up on the history and direction of the watch companies has diminished. However, that is where the Watchtime Magazine can help fill in some of the blanks."
1,Air Hammer,"Poorly made, broke quickly as did its replacement. Do not buy. Found cheaper and longer lived models at Home Depot. I have long been an Ingersoll-Rand user and have found their quality to have declined over the last 10 years. This hammer is one more example of that decline."
1,I'm selling my IR stock,"My company purchased this air hammer for light foundry work. After less than 4 hours of operation, an internal spacer crumbled and the hammer stopped hammering. Its identical replacement suffered the same fate in the same time frame."
4,Great,I wish I'd bought the entire album. She's got an amazing voice and a great band. I wish that they had a better release in the US.
4,"Good, but there's a better CD","Whether you're buying this for yourself, or as a gift, here's something you should know. There's a better CD available (with more tracks) that costs less than this one.Yep, check outThe Essential Gloria Estefanwhich has a whopping thirty-eight (38!) tracks at a bargain price. Every song on this CD is there, plus lots more.Gloria Estefan fans will do well to pass by the ""Very Best"" and head straight for ""The Essential""Amanda Richards, November 29, 2006"
5,This book is now back in print - yippee!,"Despite it's ""out of print"" listing above, this book is again available in a new paperback edition from us, the original publisher, Necronomicon Press ... please urge Amazon.com to begin offering it again ..."
2,Get what you pay for,"I know its a low-cost watch, but I expected better. Super cheap build quality. Plasticky. VERY Thick (too thick). and the light is so dim you can't see the dial.Returned it."
3,not particularly user friendly,"many nice features. keeps the time well, and the stop watch is nice. but frankly all of the machinations one has to go through to set and use the different features really need to be simplified."
5,Eclectic is an understatement!,"If there is only one Christmas CD you listen to for the entire season, it would have to be this one. There's not a dull track on it. From the sultry tones of Ella Fitzgerald on ""The Christmas Song"" to the wicked backbeat and insane harmonies of Raze's ""What Child is This?"" and the uproarious tuba rendition of ""God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen,"" you simply must put this disc in your player, hit ""repeat all"" and just listen all month long. A must-have for any Christmas music lover!"
2,Not impressed,This computer turned out to be a big headache. I have had it for six months and the hard drive has crashed twice. I continue to have problems. HP customer support is great the first time you call but after that they are unwilling to help. I can honestly say I will never buy a HP computer again.
4,Great for the price!,"Just picked this up from my local store. Refurbished price: $399! Can't believe that I've spent the last 7 years with a 850mhz HP. This is a huge difference. Great performance, but as the other owner posted, you can always add more memory for even better speed."
1,Trying to work with Vista with this hp pavillion a1700n,"This is my first review. I was not satisfied with this new computer. It started out very slow with the D drive in red. It kept saying needs attention, almost before I started to use it. I had always purchased HP, but this time it was a terrible experience. The computer did not work. I am not a novice, but trying to get technical help took hours,and I could not understand many times the accents of the outsourcing systems. I never could talk to a person in the US because one can never find a number. You run around in circles on the web site and still do not get answers. The technicians really tried, but to no avail. The vista does not have the correct drivers so when I bought a compatible printer, it come with the wrong drivers and software. I could not use it. Finally after many tries and complete reininstalls I gave up. This was a nightmare....."
1,Vista premium is the worst,I've owned several computers through the years and the new Vista Home Premium is the worst I've had to deal with. Many programs are non compatible and as for the HP support it's very confusing to navigate where as XP and prior were very simple. Also the so called HP support you can call will not help you unless the product you're having problems with installing is also a Hewllet Packard product otherwise the so called free support will cost you money. A friend just got a Dell computer and he's content with it. I used to love HP products but now it seems they don't care to help their customers anymore and unless you know computers like an expert you'll need help with this one.
1,HP support is bad,"When I got HP Pavilion A1700n desktop, I can't login the box when it doesn't have internet access. So I reinstalled the desktop with the windows vista CD in the package. Later I found out it was an updated version of vista and the production key doesn't work. There is no recovery CD in the package. When I called HP support, they told me that it was my fault and I have to pay more money to buy a new key. Why should I pay the money twice for the same version vista on the same desktop? It is ridiculous. I won't try any HP production any more. HP support is too baaad !!!"
1,HP and Vista dont play well together!,"I am sure the components of this HP computer are ok. However, overshadowing this possible capability is the fact that VISTA is not ready for primetime! Multiple hassles from HP internet sign up boxes that NEVER GO AWAY, to invalid Microsoft Vista key registration nightmares, to intolerable and ever apologetic customer support from overseas make this experience NOT WORTH IT. I am very capable with tech, having wired my house and created a network with a 16 hub switch and network printer with 8 computers, BUT I HAD TO RELY ON HP paid support 'SMART FRIEND' @ $69 for 45 minutes (which was not enough) to get this newest addition onto the Network ( it still does not see the printer, which is HP as well, and i refused to ""recharge"" my minutes for another $69). I gave this computer to my five year old instead of searching for drivers for the rest of my life!! I am shopping for a used XP machine before they disappear!!"
4,I have solved the sleep problem,"Folks,I've been quite happy with my HP a1700n overall, BUT I have had a problem with the sleep mode. I.e., I put it to sleep, and when I click on the mouse to bring it back, the screen goes black and I have to reboot.After a lot of reading tech blogs and posts, I have finally figured it out--the problem is with a recent update to the driver for the Nvidia GeForce 6150 LE graphics card (which comes standard with the computer). It gets updated automatically, through either the Windows or HP updater.Nvidia posts old versions of the drivers, and the one you need is here: [...]Download the old driver, use Device Manager to choose it, and Sleep works again.So I'm back to 4 stars, and on a good day, 5 stars."
5,These are delicious!!!!,My wife has celiac disease and we are always looking for some snacks that are gluten free that actually taste good. These are delicious!! I highly recommend !
2,typical GF taste,"Like too many GF products these are drowning in salt to drown out the bland rice flour flavor. I discovered Glutino crackers over the holidays and recommend them as the best gluten free cracker I've tried. My favorite is the Glutino Cheese Cracker with just a hint of cheese flavor that compliments rather than overwhelms the flavor of the spreads, cheese etc. spread on top. A great find for holiday!"
5,A Great Deal....A Great Cracker,"I'll let these crackers speak for themselves (they're the best if you like rice crackers - as far as I can tell, these particular crackers are the ideal platform for high quality cheddar). Needless to say, this is a great deal - two bucks a box with free shipping. Can't go wrong here, since I recently saw (and yes, bought) these same crackers at the local grocery store for nearly four bucks. Buy some, but make sure you leave some for me."
5,Excellent crackers AND gluten-free,"These are really good, mildly flavored (the plain almond ones), thin & very crispy crackers. They are good plain, and they hold up to toppings of all sorts & remain crispy. I first found them at a local store; when they sold out, the store disavowed any knowledge of ever having had them! But here they are (they cost less from Amazon), arrived very quickly, and pleased everyone--gluten and gluten-free eaters alike. Blue Diamond has a winner here. And if you are gluten-free, a whole case is wonderful to have on hand."
5,Great Snacking,"I have Celiac's and need glutten free foods. We came across these in a small country store and they are wonderfull. They are very crisp and work great for dipping, even into thicker cheese dips. The flavors and the crackers are unique but very tastey. I have tried other glutten free crackers and would not use them to fill cracks in my sidewalk.I have eaten these crackers with cheeses, dips, etc and enjoy them very much. We have served them at parties and everyone enjoyed them and did not know they were glutten free."
5,DECOYS: A CELEBRATION OF CONTEMPORARY WILDFOWL CARVING,"GREAT BOOK, WONDERFUL PHOTOS. GOOD BOOK FOR DECOY CARVERS AS YOU CAN SEE THE COLOR DETAILS OF EACH DUCK. ALL MASTERPIECES OF THE CARVERS ART. IF YOU LOVE DUCKS, WOW, YOU WILL LOVE THESE DUCKS."
2,Too Hot to Handle,"These are nice pans, but are not exactly as advertised. The handles DO get too hot to touch, and I have to use a potholder to pick them up off the stove. I wouldn't recommend these pans, and I won't buy them again."
4,Romance Stories,"I bought the book just to read Diana Palmer's Diamond Girl, but I enjoyed both of the other stories, also."
2,"Good looking, Dry, but color fades away","Just as the tittle suggest the shirt fits well, looks great and is cooler then other polos. Besides using these shirts for casual ware, I also wear these for work when I must go into very warm environments: they work well. The problem is they do not hold color well with the dark Navy blue colors being the worst offenders. I have followed the washing instructions to a tee, however, fading and blotching soon occurs. At this point the shirts are barely acceptable for wearing while painting around the house."
4,Vote for Betty Lou,"Colorful and familiar muppet characters help introduce aspects of an interesting occupation. Here, Betty Lou wants to be President. As a non-WASP, I would have preferred a less ""all-American"" muppet aspiring to be President, but at least it is a she, and not really worth mentioning when taken in context with the other I WANT TO BE... books about being a doctor, firefighter, police officer, pilot, and cowboy."
3,TRUE TO FORM,"Having seen Bentar in concert, this disk catches the rawness of their sound live, that is not heard on their studio cds. Shame this cds too short. Having released a few live cds over the years (all dealing with her early years, up to the GET NERVOUS cd), it was time for a live cd with her later material, there is just not enough of it. Nice acustic versions of ""Love is a Battlefield"" and ""We Belong"". The 4 new songs sound good enough to make me interested in a new cd from her. For a better live cd of her check the KING BISCUIT HOUR cd (4 stars), or LIVE FROM EARTH (3 1/2), skip an other live stuff from her. Overall this cd suffers from music all ready heard on other live cds, and not enough of her later music, sure would love to hear a live version of ""Sex as a Weapon"", ""Invinicble"", or any thing from INNAMORATA. Maybe next time"
3,A little too light weight....,I purchased this crepe pan after reading the reviews. (I cancelled another.)I have learned to equate 'heft' with quality. This item (packed loose) seems very flimsy (which is why it heats and cools so rapidly). I paid $15.99 for this item. I see it is now listed at $19.99. I believe it is not even worth the lower price I paid. Stick with Anolon Advanced if you are seeking quality (or the inexpensive Calphalon 'Commercial' which is heavier weight).
2,My Ruler is Coming Up Short,"What a disappointment! I've waited several months for what I thought would be a larger size non-stick crepe pan. Apparently Analon is using a defective ruler. First of all, the outside dimension with the lip is not even 10"". However, when I measure a crepe pan, I measure the inside dimension, not the outer lip because that inner dimension is going to be the size of my finished crepe.This is an 8"" crepe pan, not a 10"" crepe pan. So I guess if you really want a 10"" crepe pan from Analon, look for a 12"" crepe pan.I could have picked up an 8"" crepe pan at any discount department store; I didn't have to wait over two months for a mediocre, small, lightweight, cheesy pan."
2,ordinary recipes,Recipes are ordinary bordering on too simple. Really nothing amazing in the whole thing. I was very dissappointed. Perhaps for someone who has never cooked or camped before...
4,Handy camping cookbook,"Great basic information coupled with lots of interesting recipies. For my own purposes, I could've done with fewer dutch oven recipies and more simple ones."
3,Lots of info - poor editing (if any),"This book has a lot of info about several wireless technologies, and does a reasonable job of explaining the concepts and details. I read this book after having seen the movie (i.e., taken a class from the author on Wireless concepts), which made it easier to understand; i am not sure that a reader without that benefit would find it as useful. The spelling and grammar in the book is atrocious! The author, a very knowledgeable, engaging and humorous teacher, admitted in the class that he didn't pay much attention to all that in the book!"
1,not as hot as you expect,"You have the two words ""Caged"" and ""Heat"" in the movie title but the movie doesn't live up to its title. Yes, there is nudity but it's not hot. The acting, writing, and plot are not good."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED!,This was a very ditzy love story --Writing and story pulled together quite well but I surely could have done with out all the vulgarity.Just because guys use the f word - it should never come out of a ladys' mouth.I felt like I was associating with a very common person. [low grade mentality]Please don't bother to comment on my comments as I am too busy looking for excellent authors to bother coming back to read any further comments.Sorry but I would not recommend this book to any of my lady friends -- there are better out there. Shame on you editors!I read enough to know the difference between good and common.
2,Would not buy again!!!!!!!!,"I purchased this item this past July 5 months later the non-stick coating is peeling fron the outer edges. I use the pan every weekend for breakfast and never put it in the oven, I will try sending it back but will never purchase this brand again i thought it would last longer than 5 months!!!!!!"
1,Terrible Quality,The pan did not last 18 months after the purchase. The teflon is peeling off the edges of the pan. I would never expect this from Cuisinart. Terrible quality.
5,Cuisinart Multiclad Pro Nonstick Stainless-Steel 12-Inch Skillet,Cuisinart Multiclad Pro Nonstick Stainless-Steel 12-Inch Skillet is great. The non stick coating is excellent and should stand up well if you do not use metal utensils on it. Cleans very easily. Recommend to any one who needs a nice and useful skillet.
5,5 stars,"One of the nicest non-stick pans I have seen...It is heavy duty, large, flat, well built and cooks evenly..."
4,Excellent value,Cuisinart Multiclad is the best value on the market. Their products cook very evenly and are easy to clean. What more could I want?
2,"Very good, until it warped.","When we bought a new induction cooktop, we needed to replace a few pans with stainless ones. Based on reviews of the Cuisinart MCP, reasonable price, and non-stick interior, we purchased this piece about15 months ago.For the first few months, this was an excellent pan. Although we have not experienced the coating issues that others have reported, our pan has warped over time, to the point that the middle ten inches is bowed upward. It has created a small moat that oil retreats to, as well as temperature fluctuation across the pan due to the uneven surface. The pan has not seen extrem temperature fluctuation, nor has it benn used in the oven. It's fairl disappointing that a pan has warped like this in a relatively short period of time."
3,Nice skillet but beware. Nonstick works on both sides.,"This is a very nice pan and I am impressed. I would like to give this a higher rating. However, a year after I purchased the pan the nonstick surface is peeling all around the edge of the pan. The problem with this is that the limited warranty requires you to pay for shipping to Cuisinart and another $7.00 for them to ship it back to you. This seems like a manufacture defect to me. I am put off that I have to pay to have them ship me a skillet to replace a defect. It's cheaper than buying a new one but how do I know I won't be spending another $14 worth of shipping costs a year from now. They need to fix their process with the nonstick bonding."
3,"Cuisinart 8"" non stick Skillet","This Amazon purchase was made to replace the exact same pan that in about 15 months of use, has the non-stick coating peeling off from the outer edges. Kind of disappointed that something that's supposed to have a lifetime warranty needs replacing so soon. Otherwise the pan (and the larger 10"" skillet) are an excellent alternative to cooking in the Multiclad Pro stainless pans for things like eggs, or for things that you don't want to have stuck in the pan. There are more expensive, higher quality, non-stick pans out there, but for the money these Cuisinart Multiclad Pro non-stick skillets do a good job. Just make sure to register the purchase with Cuisinart..... like I just did."
5,must have bottle for super busy parents with hungry babies!,"I used this bottle with my son, and ordered them from the podee website. I also heard about them on TV. Our son loved them, and he could ""feed himself"". I did love holding him to feed him but admit I have fallen asleep before. I am sure we all have. My husband is handicapped, so meal times were a super busy time. I could easily fix the bottle for my son, and our meal. We could all sit together and eat at the same time. Its easy to start the nipple with just a few squeezes to it, and you can replace the nipple with ""slow"" or ""fast"" flow nipples.Enjoy! I always wanted to get these for a baby shower. I think they would make a great gift."
3,Pickey breast fed baby,I was excited to get this product for my 7 week old son. Once I got home the excitement went away. He would not suck on nipple and had no interest in it. Like many others i primed it by sucking on it then read the instructions. The milk did stay in the nipple but my son will only take the wide platex bottles and will not even attempt to drink from this one. This bottle would be great if my son would suck on it.
2,Frustrating! Not sure if I'll give it another shot!,"I was excited to get this product. When I finally bought one, I could not make it work. Can't seem to ""prime the nipple"". When I squeeze the nipple, the milk only goes up halfway the tube that's inside the bottle. Tried it multiple times! Finally I went ahead and tried sucking the nipple myself to get the milk up the nipple, but the milk obviously just goes back down when there's no more suction. I went ahead and gave it another chance and had my 3 month old give the nipple a try. She could not suck the nipple strong enough for the milk to even leave the tube that's inside the bottle. After a couple of tries, I finally gave up and transfered the milk to a regular bottle and fed her the regular way. My daughter end up spitting up after she finished her bottle probably because of the air she ended up sucking from the Podee.I really really wanted this product to work. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong."
5,worth a shot!,i LOVE these podee bottles. i first saw them on Oprah but had totally forgot they exisited till i got pregnant. these are awesome especially when baby is hungry in the car and for night time feedings. i found mine @ www.nossgalenbaby.com for $8 which was an unrefuseable offer and at least worth a shot. lots of pieces to clean though. everything can be dishwashed except the tubes which need to be cleaned with a pipe scrubber that come with the bottle. dont forget to order replacement parts too!
1,Impossible to draw liquid from the bottle out by sucking.,I brought because of it's review and looks like a great idea for babies. when I got it my baby would suck but the liquid never made it to the baby's mouth. I tried doing it myself and it was even hard for me to get any liquid out from the bottle to the nipple. And if your baby is like mine and gets bored it will pull on the cords and the whole thing falls apart. LIquid everywhere. Plus the nipple is hard.
5,Bought for Doug MacLeoad and Got a Great History Lesson,"I bought this book because Doug MacLeod, a blues musician I used to follow closely in So. Cal. during the 1980's is featured in it. I know Doug's music and that he's the real deal. To my surprise I was reading about music and America, and how integrated blues is with the history of America. I was wandering down Texas dirt roads and passing Mississippi cotton fields on the way to a juke joint and seeing people just playing music while sitting on their front porches. The struggles, the doubts, and the joys were all laid out of all of these children as they found their ""voice."" I cried, I smiled, and I realized that this book captures an important part of both American musical and oral history, yet we as Americans are missing out on something great. Reading this book helped me understand that R&B is a unique musical calling to those who follow down its road."
1,"Liar, Liar pants on fire",Back in 2004 I ordered this book and was sent the 1998 edition. The response to my complaint was basically too bad so sad. I have decided never to order any books from amazon again.
2,Duds,"Out of 40, 12 duds...33% not usable...Hopefully will not have some that later will not read.I expected better of Sony. If this experience improves,will post another review."
1,Hermes for Men cologne,CK by Klein is a lot better. I can't believe retail is $140.00. It has no staying power at all. Great looking bottle
1,Misleading,"I thought I was buying a 16 oz bottle. Instead I received 10 1.6 oz hotel samples. These are inconvenient to use and create waste in that you're not able to get all the product. If I wanted hotel samples, I would have gone to a hotel.This was not indicated on the product description. In the future, I will not purchase personal care items from Amazon-affiliated vendors !"
4,Car seat warmer,"This seat warmer works really well; it really keeps me toasty and soothes aches and pains...it has great coverage, all the way to the edges. For me, the only thing that is necessary to make it a 5 star product would be a way to adjust the heat. It's either: ON, meaning plugged in and activated by someone sitting on it; or OFF i.e., not plugged in or unoccupied-unactivated. But, it definitely works the best of the 3 models that I've owned over several years...it's a definite keeper."
1,Burned a hole in my car.,This item burned a hole in my car while I was sitting on it (while driving) in less than a month after use. I'm filing a claim with the manufacturer to replace my car seat. I could've been seriously hurt or caused an accident while driving.
1,Cheap,This item fell apart after 3 days use. I contacted company and it was like pulling teeth to get a credit or another product. Hmmmm...not too happy this time.
4,What happened to my review that was posted?,why did you take my review ( 4 star) of this CD off the site
3,"OK, but!","Pros -- easy to tell when you need to refill, and less likely to leak than other models.Cons -- The diameter of the tube forces you to separate the strings beyond a full bend. Makes me feel uncomfortable, but better than the alternative of having my guitar dry out."
5,THIS IS A GREAT READ!,"This is the story of Cammie and Tyler. Once stepbrother and sister, they meet once again after years of not seeing each other. Sparks definitely do fly. The chemistry between them is explosive. And of course, they soon fall deeply in love. But there is one problem. Tyler has a major problem with trusting. He has been betrayed in many ways by those he once loved and finds it difficult to trust Cammie. This of course causes problems in the relationship. Can their love survive all the obstacles in their wake? Read the book and find out."
1,Pricey for only a 2.4 GHz!!!,You could get a 5.8 for less. This one is overpriced. Doesn't even have an answering system!!
3,good but fan gets loud eventually,"Product was received in good condition with easy installation. It worked as advertised at first, but after almost 2 months the fane started making a loud noise while running. It requires ""mechanical agitation"" to quiet down."
5,Awesome Lotion!,"I have some of this. I got it for my elbows because they're pretty dry sometimes. I put this lotion on them daily and let me tell you, they've never been this soft! I would give this lotion 10 stars if I could. It's lightly scented as well, so it isn't overpowering or gross. It is not greasy and absorbs fast. :)"
2,Who says this is a light scent?,"I have extremely sensitive skin (most fragrances burn, including this one) and I have to ask, who says this is a light scent? This smells medicinal and STRONG. Not a good one in my book. That's why I'm giving it 2 stars. Otherwise a decent lotion. I like the texture, the fast dry, and the moisture (except it burns), but I cannot rate this above 2/5 because Advanced Therapy just smells that bad."
2,Nice salt but poor packing and preservation,"We like the taste and color of this salt formula, but even inside the inner plastic baggie it seems moist and clumpy and of course that means it is moist and clumpy when you try to use it making it not stick to the glass well at all. This brand is very expensive compared with others but the moistness and clumping issue makes it difficult to use properly. I'll not ever order this salt again."
4,Good training tool,"Purchased item based on Hibbon's reputation. While item has performed well, it turns out to be a little smaller then I require. Found use for it as training and safety tool for children. Recommend it as a first throwing knive for cost and ease of use."
5,Great knives,"These little knives (I bought the small set) have preformed like champs. I bought them for my brother as a birthday gift, and they are awesome little knives. Very well balanced, they are excellent for throwing and can take quite a bit of a abuse with grace. After a week and a half of being thrown by two novice throwers, into each other, into the ground etc. they have stayed straight and sharp and are still in great condition. The blades have a few nicks from running full speed into the back of the previously thrown knife, but its nothing that cant be fixed by a dremel or knife sharpener. Overal these things are absolutely solid. The case isn't half bad either."
1,BROKEN KNIVES,"Got the knives in a timely manner.After 2 short throwing sessions, 2 of the 3 knives were broken. Both broke in half at the hole closest to the blade.I'm very disappointed. I'm going to try a set of the hibben 2nd generation knives(large), but if these break I'm done with hibben throwers."
1,One broke after 5 throws,"I thought these were great--until one shattered into 3 pieces. I've had these knives for 2 days. I'm throwing at a wood target on a wooden deck, so it's not like I abused the knife. I am returning these, hopefully without a hitch."
1,unprofessional packaging and all three showed up badly broken,"when the package arrived, inside a yellow padded envelope was the box of knives, and the box was sealed shut with tons of packing tape that looked like it was wrapped on by a child. When I opened the box, there was no padding inside, and broken pieces of all three knives were sliding around in the box. Strangely, my order of a small set of the knives arrived separately and looked professionally boxed with some padding inside and absolutely everything intact. No idea what was up with the large knife set, but i'll update this post to let you know if the return process goes smoothly or not."
1,You don't get what you're paying for,"Maybe my unit is not typical but: the radio does not work, the phone works occasionally and when it works it's not loud enough. I got better phones for half the price I paid for this piece of trash.Do NOT buy it unless all you want is a phone prop on your coffee table but, even for that you could do better."
2,Not too impressed,"I'm disappointed with this phone. The sound is hollow, kind of static-y. Even with the volume turned up to the max it is sometimes hard to hear the person you are talking to and I have never had a problem with other phones. I'll probably buy another phone. The ring is annoying too."
1,Poor identification,This item needed a base unit to operate. The product description did not properly identify this need.
1,Disappointed,"This phone had all the features I was looking for, I thought. However, when I received the phone and hooked it up, the time display is not illuminated! How is one supposed to see the time? The other problem was that the alarm clock does not work. Additionally, the radio is tuned by a dial, which is old technology. I will be returning this item and continuing my search."
3,"Wide range of cultures, so-so ingredients","Overall, this is a great starter book for someone being introduced to vegetarianism, since many of the dishes are just vegetarian versions of wellknown meaty dishes. However, Ms. McCartney relies a little too heavily on meat substitutes in her recipes. For example, she uses vegetarian sausages and vegetarian ground ""meat"" in many of the recipes. I would recommend finding a book that relies on the wonderful flavors of fresh vegetables, herbs, mushrooms, and grains, rather than on a fake processed product."
5,Gregorian Meets The 21st Century,"From the first few notes of the very first track, I was hooked on LESIEM! The vocal quality, the orchestrations, the mixdowns and the tunes themselves all combine to bring Gregorian-style chant into the 21st century. I am a fan of the artists ERA, E. S. Posthumus, Pilgrimage, Magna Canta, Gregorian and others; LESIEM fits well within that genre I like to call ""Classical 21st Century"". LESIEM's style is that of power, intensity and movement. The interplay of the chorus with the instrumentation is masterful! Caution: even though there are several CDs of their work, there is some duplication of previous tunes on later CDs. Don't buy a CD just because it has a new name and cover-art. :-) However, you will NOT be disappointed with ANYthing by LESIEM."
3,Playlist,"I ordered this CD along with their title Aurora, both from Amazon, and because the playlists aren't listed, I ended up with 2 identical cd's, save for one song that was different. I was quite disappointed to have spent so much on shipping and handling, just to end up with basically 2 of the same cd's. It would be nice if the songs on each CD could be listed, for easy comparison."
4,Lot's of great vocabulary!!,"This book has it all, in my opinion, great vocabulary, cute plot, funny characters. Even if the kids don't understand who Meryl Sheep is, the grown-up reading it will get a kick out of it and all the other word-play going on!"
1,Excrutiating,"This is one of the worst kids' books I've ever read. Bad puns, blah illustrations, overly repetitive, not clever or witty or funny at all. The ending is especially terrible."
4,An enjoyable tale about two wolves who make the rounds to try to get food.,"I liked this book very much. I was able to flip through the pages and look at the pictures in order to get a pretty good idea about the story. Then when I went back and read the text it fit together a little better. The text has some built-in humor and the illustrations are all very good.The story is about two male wolves that go from pig community to sheep community in search of a meal. At the outset we find the wolves with a picnic basket in hand running away from some pigs. They take a little breather after they get away and enjoy their meal. Then they move on and try to take advantage of some sheep. There are 18 scenes (2-pages each) in this book.Although kids will probably love this book, I would have liked it better if it were the sheep that won over the wolves instead of their owners. And the sheering of the wolves' fur while they were dressed was just a little too corny for me. 4 stars!"
3,LONGESTITLEINTHEWORLDSOLISTENCAREFULLYAHAHAHAHAJUIJUIQWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:):(:):)!!!!!,WOW!This book is awesome!I liked when they go to the pig's house and the pigs scared them like 20 miles!(I THINK THEY'RE BABIES) I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!! IF YOU LIKE FUNNY STORIES THIS IS THE BEST BOOK TO READ TO LAUGH!!
4,Nice cool jazz,This is one of the best Mancini albums. Nice smooth jazz. Great for that tap room atmosphere. Pour yourself a drink and sit back and listen.
2,"I'd rather read ""Physics BY Game Programmers""...","While there is a good deal of valuable information in this book, there is not much you can't find in a physics textbook. The author is an engineer with no (credited) game programming experience and his attempts to tailor his examples to game development fall flat.I'd rather read ""Physics BY Game Programmers"", because there is nothing specific to game development in this book!Finally, I find it a bit suspicious that two very positive reviews appeared one day after I originally wrote this review (May 19th). Take reviews from 'Top' reviewers who have reviewed 500++ books with a grain of salt."
4,This book does a good job introducing Visual FoxPro,"Although the book was intended for VFP 3.0, it is an excellent introduction to FoxPro Object Oriented Programming. It is intended as a short introduction and command reference and it does that well."
5,"Charm, pathos, sorrow and joy.","An elderly friend recommended then lent me this book and I was so moved by it I felt I needed to purchase my own copy. What affected me so much? The honesty the Indian judge regarding a world that I have heard about but never experienced, the joy of his wry sense of humor, his integrity and compromise, and a deep love weaving through every letter. I was left feeling elated and sad, knowing that this friendship between two unlikely people was destined long before either of them were born, and meant for their mutual blessing. It is a book I will cherish."
5,Excellent mattress,"I bought this mattress because I wanted an alternative to a bed. It is extremely comfortable, warm and overall, a very good mattress."
4,XL SIZE IS A WINNER!,"Here's the deal. I finally figured out what was going on with me. As I get older, the sleeping pads I use are getting bigger and bigger. That's OK.. The thing I LOVE about this one is that the XL size is actually extra WIDE!!!! I absolutely HATE when my arms drop to my sides with standard air mats. I have had 4 different sizes over the years and this one is BY FAR my favorite. Yes, it is soft and warm and thick, but the WIDTH is the best part by far. (I am 5' 11'' and 187 lbs with a 43 inch chest). If you are of similar dimentions I would strongly suggest the XL size! UPDATE: as of July 07' I have found a new use for this XL mattress. The bunks we have at the Fire station are pretty much shot, 10 year old prison mattresses (they probably get better ones), anyhow, I have been bringing this whenever I work a night shift, and man does it help me get comfortable if I can manage a break long enough to get some shut eye. Now it is even more then justified it's cost!"
5,Very comfortable pad.,"I used this 1/2 season for car camping (with a cot). It was just like sleeping in my own bed. When I took apart the pad to wash the cover I noticed that one of the components is a high quality self inflating pad. Although I haven't done it yet I'm sure that this can be used standalone as a back packing pad. Its wider than most pack pads but I think it would still be OK. As you notice this is quite expensive for a sleeping pad, but if you insist on a good night's sleep its worth every penny. I only have one. My wife and I fight over it, so I'm ordering another.03/03/2012 Well, its now over 4 years since I bought this (two of them) and they are still as good and as comfortable as new. I do baby them by storing them flat and uncompressed inside a zippered mattress cover which hangs in the back of the garage. When being transported to and from campsites I still use the supplied plastic covers that come with the mattresses."
1,Misleading,This book is not very well illustrated and it is confusing. It is nothing like it's description. Better to look elsewhere if you are hoping to use Acupressure.
5,Practical manual. Precise diagrams.,"This is a very good manual, don't expect detailed explanations because there aren't. However, the diagrams are clear, precise and even though they are in black and white images they show everything that is necessary.I have no experience on acupressure and I can say that this manual is really useful. I have tried the explanations exposed here and to my surprise they really work! immediately, great, useful knowledge!Congratulations to the author.Amazon's delivery to Mexico is just excellent, quick and efficient."
5,Acupressure Book,"Love this book!!! Excellent pictures. Straight forward, easy to use, and very helpful information. These pressure points work. I've gotten rid of caffeine headaches and a number of other things with the information in this book. A God send."
5,My opinion,"This is an outstanding guide to acupressure. The diagrams are superb, and the explanations of what you are doing are also very, very good. I have several books on this subject, and this one is the most outstanding of all because the diagrams are so very good. Even if you are new to acupressure you will be able to follow the instructions easily. It's simply a terrific book."
3,Clear explanations but poorly edited,"I bought this book for a university level statistics course. While the book has been helpful, I have been troubled by the vast number of editorial mistakes in the sample problems - wrong answers, incorrect data tables etc. Most textbooks have an error or two, but so far I have come across mistakes in every chapter."
5,Stats = Fun,"With this excellently written, lively, and sometimes tear-jerking look into the basic principles of statistics, there is not a chance in hell your kids won't grown up to be rocket scientists."
3,"Quality is so-so, but it's a nice big box","We bought this kit for a two week RV trip. The box is nice and big but the stuff that comes inside it is pretty crummy - we ended up taking most of it out and substituting our own stuff. Also, the latches on the box do not stay closed if at all banged around. On the other hand, it's cheap! :)"
2,Overpriced for the content,"This is the only book I've ever read where the author actually quotes herself. Too much of the book is Bev singing the praises of Bev and selling her other books and workshops. It has some useful information, but overall it is overpriced for the content. One of her chapters is a half page long! The only reason I bought it is because there is a lack of information about setting rates for consulting, and this was addressed in her book in a straightforward manner."
2,Oh PLEASE!,"$49 for a 62 page book of Bev congratulating Bev, Bev singing the praises of Bev, and Bev subtly or not-so-subtly recommending Bev's training courses and workshops.Expert advice regarding such issues as general business equipment you need - computer, fax machine, separate business phone, etc. The kind of thing that if you can't figure out for yourself you better keep your day job forever. But nothing about core skills such as researching potential funders.An entire chapter bragging about how much money she made with her marketing newsletter, but no practical advice about what might be included in such a newsletter.Yes, there were nuggets here and there. But they were VERY few and far between. The rest was just Bev loving Bev.Guess she's fairly savvy, though. I spent 49 bucks for a book that looks like the cheap, self-published pamphlet it is."
1,A Disappointment and A Waste of [money],"This book was not worth [money]. There were 62 pages with a large font (perhaps size 14 or 16) with a paperback, stapled binding. The book is anecdotal and has a conversational tone. The language format chosen is surprising given the fact that the author is a professional writer. The book not only sounds home-made, but looks it. The graphics and layout looked as if the book was published on Microsoft Publisher. I wish that I had seen this in a bookstore because I certainly wouldn't have wasted the money."
1,Overpriced!,"I can't comment on the validity of the information contained because of my lack of grant writing experience, but I am absolutely certain I paid way too much for way too little. This book reminds me of my grade-school strategy to dupe the teacher into thinking she got what she asked for by writing with really big letters and repeating paragraphs verbatim in order to fill us space. Didn't work back then, either."
1,Disappointed,I was utterly surprised and disappointed when I opened the box and found what can only be described as a pamphlet inside.It certainly is NOT worth the $49 price tag. The roughly 60+ sheets (printed on both sides) of paper and the oversized type serve as negative reminders that I paid far too much for this booklet.
2,So-So and Way-Overpriced,"""How to Become A Grant Writing Consultant"" did have some useful information and tips. But it is not worth the [money] and it is almost insulting that the author charges so much for so little ""real"" information. The only reason I bought it was because I am very interested in the field and could not find the book in a library. I figured that I could re-sell it on Amazon.com and I did (in one week) so I recouped some of my investment and I'm happy. ""How to Become a Grant Writing Consultant"" is not a book that anyone needs to add to their permanent library collection."
2,How to Become A Grant Writing Consultant,"Disappointing. Gives just a brief overview of the grants writing process. Suggest you do the preliminary research of grant writing on the internet (there are tons of sites) and save your money. She does give you a few tidbits, such as how much to charge for projects (this info can't be found easily elsewhere.) Overall, this book would be a better value to you at half the asking price. However, if you are unfamiliar with in-depth research or want a quick info find, go for the book it will fill the need. No information given of how to structure a grant proposal, however."
1,Gruesome,"This is written from a police officers perspective and is based on a true case. The first NINE chapters describe in detail the murder, the condition of the body when found (i.e. eaten by animals, maggots, the smell, etc.) and details of the autopsy. Then it goes into a boring dialog of looking for the killer and at the end gets gruesome again. I read a lot of murder mysteries but I do not read books like this that go on and on about the the details. The gruesome parts can be left in the background to suit me. This was such a depressing book (even more so now that I found out it is based on a true case). I will not pass it on to anyone. I will put it in the reclycing bin on trash day and never buy another one with this duo of authors."
4,Enjoyed it,I enjoyed this book and the series. The characters are interesting and was well written. I look forward to reading more of her books.
1,Doesn't work with Vista 64 bit,"The driver won't work with windows Vista 64 bit system. I found this out after talking to multiple support people and submitting requests on the internet. I never recieved any response, I always had to spend 20 minutes on hold to talk to someone.Camera feels cheap and I imagine it would be difficult to push ""click"" button without shaking the camera.Since I was never able to use it, I can't say if the quality is good or bad.I have used Dino-lite scopes before and I was impressed with them, that is what I am going to buy right now.I was impressed with Amazon's return procedure, if you buy one it will be easy to return."
4,Celestron 44300,"The digital microscope performed as I had expected, somewhat better than a previous model from another vendor with the same specs and software driver. The only negative I can find is that the fluted adjustment knob is difficult to manage, but in my case usable since I mounted the camera to a stand with an adjustable height mechanism. That said, I am very pleased with the camera. The images are very clear throughout the range of magnification."
1,No windows 7 support,"Will not run on vista or windows 7 because drivers are not digitally signed.

5,Fantastic educational item... WOW!!,"This is the most amazing thing, all I can say is we NEVER had stuff like this when I was a kid! What a great age we live in. My daughter loves looking at everything from flower petals to hair follicles, etc., all with crystal clarity and easy use.The software loaded flawlessly and the scope comes right up on the screen. She's 6 and she can use it by herself. I have to admit, I feel kind of like a kid again when I use it and explore stuff. Freeze frames are fun to print out, and easy to figure out too. This scope produces very sharp images and has a fantastic magnification range for what it is.I could not recommend this item any more highly. It is GREAT. You will love it. Buy one, you won't be sorry."
1,Disappointed,This item looks nice but it just sways in the wind without the tubes hitting each other to 'chime'. Also it's much smaller than I expected. A waste of money.
3,Windchime?,"This looks very pretty but it doesn't make a whole lot of noise, maybe it's just me and I don't notice it. I just wish it were a little louder or something."
5,Sweet!,"I've hung this chime just inside my bedroom window. It catches light breezes, and the sound is very light and sweet...like a child's laugh. I love hearing it throughout the day and how it filters through into my dreams at night."
4,Fine!,It's built solidly. It makes chime sounds when the wind blows. It looks nice. What else can I say about a wind chime? No problems here.
1,Do Not Buy This,"Other reviews have said this was BAD and I should have believed them!!!! This does not chime and the wood is so cheap, I doubt if it will last a month. How sad to be taken this way. And now I have to pay sales tax on it too. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!"
3,Okay I guess.,"These windchimes are alright for the musical purposes I purchased them for, but they don't sound very akin to real studio windchimes.I'm not sure whether these are meant for music use or an outdoor decoration.The company name is ""Woodstock Percussion"" so I assumed the former, but it really can't be told."
4,Soothing Sounds,"I only wish that I had more wind. This chime makes wonderful music. If you like hearing beautiful sounds when the wind blows you will love this! Not to mention the price is very resonable, most chimes in stores are much more expensive, and not as nice for the price."
2,chime for major wind,"This is a beautiful sounding chime. It is not loud and sounds almost like tinkling glass.Here's the catch: need major wind to have it work. We moved it to a number of places which were open to the wind. When you hang it by its cord, the entire chime moves in circles. Nice circular movement, but no chime. The idea is for the metal rods to move, which chime, not necessarily the wood holder. As we live in an area where there wind is the norm; we thought this would be a nice addition outside of our kitchen window, but after watching it spin around and not chime, its a disappointment.If the string attached to the top of the wood were sturdier/thicker, it might limit the movement of the wood and let the wind move the chimes."
2,Didnt chime :(,"I put these chimes out on a moderately windy day while laying in the sun. Despite several strong winds, they didnt make a sound, just twirled. I guess if your in a hurricane they're all right, but I sent them back."
4,Good sounds,The cd was pretty good. Sounds that I would not have expected and it was the right price. I liked it.
4,"DVD tray sticks, buy service plan if available.","Not too bad to install. Dvd tray sticks when opening, however if you lightly touch front of DVD tray it will open. This is pretty annoying on $350 item. Comes with a 90 day manufacturers warranty. Highly reccomend buying service agreement where available."
1,Did not work for me,"The adapter I received is not the same as the one in the picture. The one I have actually resembles the official nintendo one more, but of course it is not that (no official nintendo seal, did not buy from nintendo,etc). I tried both USB ports on the wii, multiple ethernet cables, and every slot on my router. All of my ethernet cables work and every slot on my router works, but it will not acknowledge the connection between the ethernet cable and wii lan adapter. I've checked to make sure I haven't randomly set it up incorrectly without realizing it. I have done everything correctly and still nothing. I'm either getting the official nintendo one or buying a wireless router next. This is not worth it."
5,Great For Behind the Wheel,"This is an amazingly helpful car Spanish course. I've learned a ton of Spanish already and I am only on CD 2. Fortunately, the book matches the cd's perfectly for home review and there is even a word for word tapescript and and answer keys (and English translations - what a Godsend) on the same page as the exercises..I received the multi-track version of this set but I feel that with the built in review that the single track version would work just fine in the car as well. I rarely if ever use the multi-tracks because the course is designed to be 'real time' which means you don't have to artificially speed it up or slow it down. Just keep playing the CDs and you'll learn to speak Spanish.My set has 6 tracks per CD and they are beautifully produced."
1,Didn't do it for me,"I found this system disorganized, inefficient and ultimately ineffective for learning Spanish. There is too much English on the tape and very little conversational or cultural context. A good system would have dialog presented in context with lots of repetition and building drills and minimal English explanation on tape. Or maybe put the explanation on separate CD tracks so that it can be skipped after it is heard a time or two. By the way, the CD tracks seemed to be cut-up randomly and had very little flow or consistency. I have not tried any of the other systems but this one was a disappointment."
3,Needs better packaging,Good product in general. My biggest issue is that the packaging is so bad that each time it was sent to me the cds had fallen out of their place in the container and got scratched up.
4,Effective and engaging,"I have only gotten through 1.5 of the CDs so far. I appreciate several things about this learning program. The program goes at a managable pace for me. After numerous re-playing of the first CD, I think I have a good grounding in the basics. As someone with plans to travel in MX in a few months, I appreciate the emphasis on the practical vocabulary. Sometimes, when I get in the car, I really don't feel like turning the program on (and sacrificing NPR), but every time I do, I find that I enjoy the relaxed speaking styles of both the English instructor and the Spanish speaker so much that I quickly get engaged in the lesson. Frustrations for me have included the CDs skipping at times, and unlike cassette tapes, inability to rewind or fast forward. Also, the box with the CDs is not effective at storing them, and they fall out when the case is opened."
4,Great Program,I like the way you can practice with the instructor. It is so simple that my grand daughter is learning Spanish along with me.
4,a good refresher,"I've found this book/cd set very useful. I had a few years of Spanish in high school, but that was eons ago, and I hardly remembered anything. I think the pace of the course is just about right for beginners but a tad slow for people with previous knowledge of the language. The one frustrating thing is that the answer key is sometimes wrong (for example, the answer will have nothing to do with the question or might just be a repeat of the previous answer). It would also be nice if the answers weren't in such teeny tiny font, but I understand the need to conserve paper. Finally, there are several typos throughout the book. All in all, a helpful product though."
4,excellent,"After trying several other spanish CDs, I finally found this excellent CD and text. It was just the right pace and the lessons are in a logical order. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to learn spanish."
5,just what i was looking for,very easy to follow and makes learning spanish pleasant and comfortable.
2,Duplicate Product,"I ordered this and Conversational Spanish (by the same author) for my husband for Christmas. We were quite upset to find out that these two products are the same. So, buy one or the other, but not both. Also, these CD's are directly copied from tapes, so the tape instructions, like rewind to repeat the sentence, don't work. Also, there are long silences where the tapes begin and end. The lessons are useful, but they aren't formated for CD's."
4,CLEAR AND CONCISE - MODERN APPROACH,"I found this course excellent. Mark Frobose has a very modern approach to language learning. He gets right into it with phrases that you would use everyday and just builds on it from there. Mark and Luis have extremely easy-to-listen-to voices. This is the first time I have learnt a language and this course has made it very enjoyable. The CD's can be played anytime, in the car or at home. Grammar has to be learnt, but can be tedious, but this method just propels you along. I found the book very good, and by doing the exercises set out in the book was a further learning tool. The cost of me getting the course from Amazon and getting to Australia was well worth it.I started learning Spanish for self-interest with a girlfriend and had no intention of travelling to any Spanish speaking countries. Having this course makes me want to go now!!"
5,Learning in the car,"I have put the first CD in my car and a couple of times a week I play it. I learn, I review, and it is all at my own pace. And it does not take time out of my already busy day. After a leisurely month or so, I think I am ready to move onto the next disc.I am not preparing for a specific trip, but rather learning for fun and for future traveling which gives me a great deal of time, but one could progress faster. The accompanying book allows for visual learning as well as audio. The material is straight forward and doesn't incorperate funky music. I like it and would recommend it to others."
3,Lesson's good but outdated and poor quality cd,"This program has very good lessons but is out dated.. It still discusses the the old Spanish alphabet vs the new one (relatively minor). The real issue is with the CD's themselves, they must have been copied from tapes and several of the CDs cut off in midsentence/lesson. This is pretty irritating when you pay good money for a product"
3,exotic Princess,I didn't think this was a very good teaching tool. I ended up giving it away to someone. There are better teaching guides out there..
3,Spanish made easy.,"I was very bummed that the CD's I received were badly scratched so I don't get all of the lessons all the way through. That being said, I'm glad I bought this product. It is definitely for someone like me who knows enough Spanish to be able to answer before the speaker says the answer. However, I am learning a lot and hope to be fluent very soon."
3,Well done,"I've used no other program to compare Behind the Wheel to, but I'm finding it very easy to follow and actually look forward to listening and working with the booklet. Highly recommend it."
3,Hypnotism and the English language,This book may well be a treasure of hypnotic instruction. However I feel it would be a lot better if the writers and EDITOR had bothered to proof read it. There are so many English errors in the book it makes it annoying and difficult to concentrate on the content of the book.Apart from that - read the other reviews.
3,Just alright,"This is an O.K hand grip. A little bit of the stitching starts to come off in a few days, but nothing major. Since it is so thick, if you play on a double horn, when you bring down you thumb, your thumb will slide across the top of the guard, and it feels awkward at first, but you get used to it. As the name suggests, it is made of neoprene, not leather, so if your hand sweats a lot, this is the perfect thing for you. Whoever said that the grip doesn't fit a horn, it fits a trumpet, don't let that stop you from buying this. It fits my Conn 8d perfectly."
3,Good quick review.Kindle version needs editing.,"Saw my colleague using this, browsed through it and thought it was a nice one to keep for a quick review.Bought the kindle version though since I'm always carrying my smartphone.Overall it was good but the pictures and texts does not coincide/align with each other most of the time.(very evident especially on muscle pain referral patterns pictures and texts).For me it's not confusing since I know what the muscles are but for others that may not be familiar, it's misleading due to the texts and pictures not aligned.Hence the three stars.Please fix it."
2,Disappointment,"It was a disappointment. The Spanish spoken was hard to understand, naturally, as I'm a Spanish beginner. It would have been helpful if the words had been spelled out but that wasn't done.After struggling with two lessons I donated it to the library book sale."
1,Do not support this scamming company,"Do not support this company. They run a scam, ripping people off with lies. Their product is just a front for a stealing money, so though Amazon may not be part of that, by supporting this company, you are supporting Pimsleur's online scam. They sell a product for $9.95, but then keep charging people's credit cards, saying there was information sent in the package. Based on my own and the experience of others I have read, no one can find this other paper in the packaging. Please, DO NOT SUPPORT THIS COMPANY."
4,Buy the whole thing (Spanish 1),"Nothing wrong with the product. It doesn't cost much so you don't get much. It is actually the first 4 cd's of Spanish 1. Its helpful if you don't know any Spanish, but if you do have some experience this will not be enough for you. I would suggest you buy the entire Spanish 1 set."
2,"Does not deliver on its promise, but good accent practice","""I want 2 beers,"" ""Where's the bathroom?"", and ""Let's eat in the hotel."" Oops. I just gave away the ending. AFter 8 lessons, that's about all you'll learn in terms of content. It does NOT deliver on its promise to teach how to hold a real conversation in Spanish (I doubt I will ever hold a conversation like the ones in their examples). But it did give me very good practice in pronouncing the accents properly. If you've never learned any Spanish, this could be a good way to start and to build confidence in your ability to learn it; then go learn some real content elsewhere."
4,Good toy for learnin,"I got this for my son's 7th birthday. I almost didn't because the picture they use (Eiffel Tower) makes it look like there aren't many pieces. The instructions have 6 models, all of which are fairly complicated and he needed help making them. Since then, he has made some things on his own that have looked pretty good. As an engineer, I like seeing him learn how things go together and what needs to be done to make things stable. He also got a bunch of lego sets around Christmas, but they can really on make what's on the box--the Erector set allows him to use his imagination. He hasn't used them much yet, but I think it's because there aren't that many pieces to work with. I'm looking at getting another set, or perhaps the mechanized version so he can see his creations move."
3,Erector set review,"This product is a long way from the old erector sets. the pieces are larger and plastic (probably safer) but not as intricate or as numerous. It would be wise to purchase extra parts immediately, since the number with this basic set are way too few"
3,If your tired of loosing legos,"My son likes this toy. No small pieces to loose like legos. Fun to build things and good for hand eye coordination, But he still Loves the legos, so it is a nice addition for the child who likes to build, but not a replacement for legos."
2,Not sure why everyone thinks this is so great,"After reading all the fabulous reviews, I got this for my boys for Christmas. Almost three months later, it has barely been played with. Anything put together falls apart too soon to actually be able to play with it. Even I tried building things and got frustrated with the parts not staying together. I can only imagine how the kids feel. This toy sits on a shelf and hardly ever gets used."
1,Ultimately useless,"Parts are made of slippery plastic. Nuts, bolts, screws don't stay together. Beware. Not a good learning lesson for kids, only a lesson in frustration."
3,Nice toy,"I bought this for my grandson's birthday, he liked it and enjoys putting things together and trying to create new things. The plastic nuts, bolts, and beams are a good introduction to mechanics."
1,The Missing Chapter,"Beginning Visual Basic 6 Objects by Peter Wright and Wrox Publishing should not be purchased without also downloading and printing 'The Missing Chapter', the 13 printed pages of text and code corrections available (online)As published, very few of the code samples work because of the rampant code errors. This is especially frustrating since one of the chief teaching aids for a book like this is to provide well designed code samples that you can try out to demonstrate the concept being taught.I think it is inexcusable that neither the author or the publisher took the time to proofread the text and test the code before publishing it as a teaching tool. Their only redemption is that they do offer the current list of corrections on their web site.Without the error corrections, this book will only further confuse and frustrate those seeking clarity on a confusing and frustrating topic."
1,Unorganized,"The book was started in a good way and ended i dunno where. The author keeps on mentioning ""we'll discuss this more later in the chapter or in chapter blah"" but it just goes straight to /dev/null, e.g., the three interface(one of them being the IUnknown, what's the other 2?), if i missed it, i may have fallen asleep reading this; very disappointed."
3,Get Another Book!,"This is my 3rd book from WROX. My first two books are fantastic, except for the too-small print which makes them hard to read. This book however is a BIG disappointment. The author probably knows what he is talking about. He just doesn't know how to say it clearly. Because the book jumped around from topic to topic without cohesiveness, it comes across as a hodge podge of this, that, and the other thing. I found it annoying when the author frequently referred to his ""other"" book instead of including an extra page or two to review the topic in this book. What a concept!I don't recommend that you buy this book. Get a copy of John Smileys book on Programming Objects with VB 6. Smiley's book is more cohesive and I prefer his teaching style.I gave this book 3 stars instead of just one, because it's not all bad. I must have learned something from reading it and doing the exercises, though I am hard presed to say exactly what I learned."
5,YOU WANT THIS BOOK,"Despite the bad jokes and off center humor, get the book. You want this book. If you are wanting to get into Object Oriented in general and are somewhat familiar with VB syntax, get the book. Are you tired of only being able to nod with a meaningful look on your face when your colleagues start talking abount instantiations, and persistence..?? Get the book. This book takes what is generally thought of as a difficult topic and makes it so easy. He not only tells you how's but, also why's....This book is extremely easy to read and understand. He steps you through important OO concepts very smoothly - like buttah - you glide right into the confidence you need in order to look at almost any OO project and say ""I can do that"". Listen, get the book...."
2,"Starts well, and then...","Peter Wright's writing style means that the book is easy to read from the start (albeit the humour is very cheesy). The first few chapters get you rolling well in setting up your own classes and objects with the minumum of fuss.Having said that, the chapter on Interfaces is just plain awful. Once I finished that chapter, I was left feeling confused - the author makes it seem as if there's very little use in Interfaces at all - which simply is not true.It doesn't really get much better later on. There are some infuriating errors in the sample code (I always try to give publihses a little leeway for typos given the limited publishing time for technical books, but there are so many stinkers in this book that they're impossible to forgive). Then, there's a whole chapter which seems to be a rehash of the second half of the chapter before. I wouldn't mind if it was about something unduly complicated, but it's only Property Pages! Irritating."
5,Rare Find,"What a delightful book to have found by chance at the library. I have a paticular fondness for all things Italian so the cover of this book jumped at me right away. What I found inside was a story that is immediately enchanting, funny, sweet, and nostalgic. The characters come to life and you find your self rooting for good outcomes for them all. I have about 10 pages left to read and I don't want the book to end! It's rare to find a book that's so engaging and well-written but without all the usual sex, vulgarity, and/or immorality that is usually found in today's reading. Well done!"
2,"Precious, Derivative and Boring",Every reveal foreknown and an eternity to develop. Read any of Barry Unsworth on Italy ('After Hannibal') for the geniune experience.
3,Toscanamericano,This was a sweet book. It does show the lamenting Italian character as well as the way in which Tuscans are most welcoming of strangers in general. The antisemitism aspect seemed out of touch with the Tuscany I know and admire. The characters were a tad bit flat. The fascination with Evangelism also seemes out of character with the prevailing Religious views of the region where heresy is actually orthodox. Nevertheless the delicate way in which the protagonists were handled was very touching and genuine. The eventual reconciliation of the barista and his wife was handled with finesse and was very Tuscan. Some of the parolacce (colorful language) were a little off but it was a great read overall.
3,So-so reading,"The book is a pleasant glimpse of Italian village life with an ok story and implausible events. How could Leo steal the fresco, and then put it back so no one noticed? How could mass be conducted in a church which was seriously damaged in an earthquake? How could a priest be fooled into thinking he was seeing an angel with the use of a film projector? I'm glad I read it, but I do feel it is not well written, including odd choices of words and repeating some things too much, such as discussion of Marta's anger."
1,a boring book,"one of the worst books I've read in ages... predictable at every turn... and not at all imaginative... a complete waste of time! If ever there was a book I couldn't wait to put down, this was it!"
3,Sweet and Fun,"I just finished reading this for my book club. It's a sweet and fun read about love and miracles in the lives of the inhabitants of a tiny village in Tuscany. There are some interesting characters and plenty of quirkiness, and aside from a smattering of mild language and mildly suggestive moments, nothing offensive.It might also get you thinking about miracles, and what constitutes one. And you might also start to see more in your own life."
5,Wonderful story,"You know when you pick up a book and you don't really know if you will like it or not then POW!you're right in the middle of a wonderful love story, rooting for em and its just a joy. Then the fateful day arrives and you finish it...slowly because you don't want to let it go, what with all that wonderful immagery of the Italian country side, the olive groves, the gnarled old priest trying to save the town, the clever kids who divert people to the town etc etc and of course the remote possibility of romance and you just love them all and then, they're gone, but I'll tell you this, they sure aren't forgotton. Wonderful story and so beautifully written."
4,An entertaining read!,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is sweet and entertaining. You can't help but smile while reading it.
4,Italian love story,"This had all the elements necessary to a good story. Pious priest with long held secret, bad boy who came back to town to settle his father's estate only to reconnect with the woman he loved but left to another when he thought she did not love him, several con jobs perpetrated by bad boy and friends to make money so they could leave, only to find that they did not want to leave, saving a damsal in distress so that she could be with her true love. It was a fun read and kept me guessing until the end when the priest's secret was revealed. I did not see it coming! I read this book as part of a bookclub assignment and all of us agreed (6) that it was one of our favorites this year. Would highly recommend this book, especially as a summer beach/vacation read. You won't be sorry."
4,My favorite scent,I love this brand and I wish Liz Claiborne still sold it. Smells pretty much the same but quite a bit lighter than the original.
4,love it!,"I love this scent on my husband and he likes it too, but we can't find it in stores anywhere anymore so I was very excited to find it here!"
4,Good stuff!,"My wife didn't like it the first time I put it on...it's not nearly as sweet as some of the other colognes that I've bought. But, since the second time I wore it, she's loved it. I do too.It's definitely a masculine scent...I highly recommend it."
1,don't buy from vendor,"I have bought this perfume from perfumania, but after looking at the sale price for this item then I went ahead and got it. I was happy with the scent when I purchased it before, but please do not buy from this seller. The scent is not the same it is full of alcohol and you practically have to spray the half of a bottle for it to smell an hour later."
1,Is There A Sinus Doctor In The House???,I bought this based on the good reviews and regret to say that this is a better room spray than worn. A teenager or meathead can get away with this crappy scent but if you want to have tasteful approval then look elsewhere.
2,Good Advertising,"It's proven to me once again that a great ad is not necessarily indicative of a great product. This men's cologne will definitely remain at the back of my cupboard. I would give it away but wouldn't want to offend any of my friends...hmmm, that gives me an idea!"
4,It's Pretty good on the value..,"I bought this for my son; whose 19 years old likes it and wears it often.It smells like sandalwood, amber, flora an hydroponic plum scent smells lightly herbal not a very strong unpleasant smell the aroma is very manly.The bottle is a VERY nice size and in a red glass bottle with the dragon on it. I think it was a great buy, I bought it as a Christmas present...I am not disappointed."
4,Awesome purchase,For it's price - a bargain buy! and a good one at that. Saw Lucky6 among the best reviewed men's EDT sprays in 2009-10 and took a punt. Strong and very masculine - the only downside is it's not that long lasting but since it's not an EDP i'd take that. Definitely worth a few compliments.
4,"Book as expected, however delivery extremely slow",The book was what I wanted. But it must have taken 3-4 weeks to arrive.
4,Golden Bird,"Larry Goldings returns to the Hammond B3 with a vengence with Moonbird. With a style reminiscent of Big John Patton, Larry can be hard-swinging or mellow with equal inventiveness. He seems constantly searching for ways to refine how the organ is played.If you like good organ jazz, then this album will satisfy you.[DW]"
5,Stellar,"Every track finds its groove and wrings it dry. From the smile inducing unison work on ""Crawdaddy"", through the absolutely haunting covor of Joni Mitchell's ""Woodstock"" to the churchin' in ""I think it's Going to Rain Today"", I was treated to quite a journey. It's one I'll take again..."
2,Disjointed jumble of plot points,"This book is a telegraphic, disjointed list of things that happen in the movie. There is no real narrative to speak of. I got the book for my 3-year-old before we saw the movie, and until then, it made no sense. Now, it is useful as a way of warding off having to go see that dreadfully acted movie again. As much as my son loves (and I appreciate) Thomas the Tank Engine, this book does a disservice to the characters and themes of the original series. The other two movie-based softcover books (one about Diesel 10 and one about Lady) are somewhat better -- they don't have the lessons of the original series, but at least they make some sense on their own."
1,Big disappointment,"Incredibly disappointing - not anywhere near the quaint stories written by the Rev. Awdry and son. This story has so many possibilities, yet never lives up to its potential."
4,Why??,"Why has this woman's story gone untold?Nixon's administration successfully ruined her life and unable to leave it at that, then ran a campaign to ensure no one would believe a word she said by claiming her to be an alcoholic buffoon; a story apparently, that her husband did nothing to stop from spreading and letting it take hold by remaining silent throughout her hellish nightmare.I am old enough to remember this episode during the Nixon years and she was treated abominably.What an incredible woman!! And, she tried to warn us..."
2,Works when it works,We go through these chargers frequently. I do not know if we are doing something or if they are not built correctly. They need more fusing to protect the unit. Usually batteries go out before the charger but this one is reversed.
4,Nice replacement but!!,It is a nice replacement for the orginal charger that came with the original purchase. However it does not fit in the carrying case like the orginal did. Serves the purpose but now requires special storage>
5,it works so far.,"So here are the twenty or more words, What does that prove? What is this all about? So here is the rest of the words."
1,JUNK,it only worked 1 time and never would charge the battery all the way. l would not recommend this product to anyont.
5,Great product,"Couldn't find this charger anywhere else. A great price, great quality and received it quickly. Would recommend it to anyone."
4,Battery Charger,The Makita DC1804 7.2-VOLT Battery Charger arrived in good conditions. The item was within the specifications of the desciption of the product. The battery charger works great.
5,Makita DC1804 7.2-Volt to 18-Volt Pod/Stick Charger,"This is everything that I had hoped it would be, and charges the batteries in no type at all, so my drill is ready to go to work!! Very happy with this purchase and will be back for more stuff!!Thank you so much, Calam"
3,MAKITA DC1804 CHARGER,THE CHARGER WORKS VERY GOOD I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CHARGERTHE ONE THING I DON'T LIKE IS YOU HAVE TO UNPLUG WHEN NOT CHARGING
5,Makita 18v drill battery charger,"Great product, it worked and charged the battery of our drill. Great and competitive price. We would buy here again for any Makita parts."
1,Same as the library,Book is way too expensive. The library has similar and better books. This book does not help study for the test...It just introduces you to question types and basics of the job that aren't asked in any civil service test..Make the same expensive mistake I did and buy the book and be very very disappointed.
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Loop is in prison, and he has a couple of large problems, namely other cons that would be happy to remove him from existence. He gets a third when Lono is introduced to the prison popular, starting off a wave of violence.Shepherd visits Lono for a chat. In the other issues, Jack takes a friend to visit a guy that has tigers, and gets pretty wild. Scratch some mafiosos and a tiger or two."
3,Transcriptions,"The English-language result of Szomjas-Schiffert's field-work in Lappland.The text is the introduction (printed first in the original Hungarian, then in English translation). The majority of the pages are filled with yoik-transcriptions Szomjas-Schiffert made in Lappland in the 70s.Szomjas-Schiffert's research is focused on relating the Sami to other Finno-Ugrian peoples (mostly looking at singing tradition, of course, but also including some romanticised observations of physiognomic similarities between Sami and Hungarian people.)There is very little in this book about shamanism. The word ""shaman"" in the title is purely poetic."
5,Great jogger!,"We've had this jogger for a couple months now and my wife absolutely loves it! It is very lightweight yet sturdy and great to run with. The suspension is wonderful (not too bouncy for the kid...) and our boy will fall asleep in it while my wife is out on her run. Great price for a great product, highly recommended!"
5,Great Product!,"This is a great product; I'm very glad I purchased it! I even waited about a month before submitting a review, just in case something broke or I had an issue with something. So far, so good! I really like the way it looks and feels. The pictures uploaded by the other customer are very helpful, by the way."
1,Avoid buying this book!,"I agree that this book does have some interesting information but it's wrong on a whole lot of things. It claims Los Angeles was the capital of California during Spanish Colonialism, which is very incorrect as Los Angeles was only a small ""extension"" village. It also says California was founded by Francis Drake, never mentioning earlier explorers. I think this book is intended for people living in New York City only."
3,Great information but some severe omissions and formatting,"I'm torn between praise for this book and condemnation for those who typeset it. What the other reviews say are true: there's a wealth of information on every page. It's surprising how much information there is in this one volume.However, I've also got to remark how surprised and disappointed I was to find severe formatting problems in the typesetting of this book. In many charts, information ends up in the wrong columns (example: the chart listing U.S. Presidents). Shockingly, the chart listing the ""50 states"" and their capitals only contains 48 states, leaving out Maine and Wyoming! As useful as this book is, these kinds of problems make one wonder about the accuracy of any of the information in it."
4,Why daddy?,"I read through this reference book and I was pleased to see how much information was included. I have noticed that other reviewers have pointed out inaccurate facts. I thought it would be a great book to have on a table, or shelf somewhere in every home. If I planned on researching something thoroughly, I would cross-reference any information between several sources. The New York Public Library Desk Reference would be a great place to start. If you have curious children with lots of questions (like I do) buy this book."
2,"Disappointing, concerned about accuracy","I've already found several errors and omissions in this book. For instance, the music section contains errors, such as its dubious claim that ""all popular songs can be accompanied by three chords"". There is no section on mental health or psychology, which I consider a major omission. And some of the tables are indeed labelled incorrectly. I do think this is a handy book, but because of its omissions and errors is often not a usable substitute for authoritative references on many of its subtopics. For many applications, a one-volume encyclopedia would be a better choice."
2,Not enough packaging,Box was packaged around sides but not on top. Box came with most of the chocolate on the bottom of the box all cracked in little pieces because the candy box inside was slapping back and forth. Could not serve to guests.
3,Ummmm UM!!,As always Joyva is the BEST! My ONLY reason for not giving this a higher rating is the bottom layer was stale. The rest was incredibly delicious!
3,Hard for the beginner,This book is a well done workbook except for the fact that there are no answers in the book. This book works only if used in a class situation where you can have an instructor to assist you.
4,Spanish Basic Workbook review,I'm really enjoying using this workbook but it can be confusing at times. You would have to have a basic knowledge of Spanish before starting it. But over all it's a pretty good book!
3,Amused by memorial songs,Sometimes I think some old songs could bring me back to the past and this CD lets me get in touch with my memories - good or bad is really not at all!
1,Pass it if you like the reql thing,Cream of the titles? Perhaps. It should be interpreted by people with a genuine Venezuelean touch. You can do better with other records out there.
1,Which Rebecca Brown?,"Is this Rebecca Brown the same Rebecca Brown MD that wrote ""He Came to Set the Captives Free"", ""Becoming a Vessel of Honor"", and ""Unbroken Curses"".? It is important for me to have this information. Thank you."
1,Outdated Information Dangerous for Iguanas,This book suggests two things that condemn it as being an unreliable source. It suggests that hatchling iguanas eat insects as a part of their diet. This has been shown not to be true. Iguanas eat only vegetable matter their whole lives and diets with high animal protein can kill them by age 6 (the process is slow and unnoticeable). The second suggestion that iguanas need to ingest gravel to aid digestion will be much more quickly fatal to an iguana. Iguanas are not birds and do not have any requirement for gravel. This book was published in 1976 and the information has been since proven harmful.
2,missed major deduction,I've used Taxcut for a few years and fairly happy with it. But this year it missed the sales tax deduction (I live in a state with no state income tax). The program defaulted to using state income tax (Schedule A line5). It should have seen no state income tax reported in the worksheet and compared to estimatedsales tax table and went with that. (a fairly large deduction)I also think the way HSBC tries to sneak in it's additional $12.95 fee for 'easy pay' is rather underhanded.
3,Problems with installation,"I've been using TaxCut for around 10 years now and this is the first year I had trouble installing the software. I tried on 3 machines before I found one that it would install on. It stopped at the same point during installation. I followed the instructions for this problem on the TaxCut web site, but it never fixed the problem. I still like the program and hope the issue is fixed for next year's version."
5,The sleek watch!!,I bought this watch because of the price & the style. The one I bought was the silver finish background but both are sharp! At the time I was able to receive free shipping and that was an added bonus. I'm really happy and get compliaments on it.
1,Really Poor,"I have purchased this CASIO watch AW81D (I love CASIO) but even though the battery life says 10 YEARS it didn't last a day. The screen went comnpletely blank. NO Analog, NO Digital! I have returned to Amazon (which states can't be returned after 30 Days) Anyway, I am very frustrated with this purchase. I hope AMAZON refund my full purchase price. I would be very much disappointed if they didn't. Anyway, I am a fan of CASIO but this particular Model I DO NOT RECOMMEND!"
3,Casto Illuminator - Black Dial,"I have had many such watches in the years past. They are robust, accurate and long lasting. I was a bit disapointed with the look of th Black Dial. It appeared a bit drab compared with the advertised image. However, I have no doubt it will function well."
1,My first UNRELIABLE Casio,"About 3 months after purchase, the digital display started to act strange...flashing randomly. Replaced the battery, to no effect. Took it into a watch repair shop, where the same failure was duplicated, and I was told to send it into Casio.Sent it into the Casio America Repair Center, but it came back with the problem unresolved...appears Casio only took care to note all the scratches on the case. So, I am sending it back in again, with more detailed description of the defect. Pretty soon, the shipping costs will be more than what I paid for this lemon.BTW, as others noted, the ""crystal"" is extremely easy to scratch."
2,Things that make you go hummm...,"Well, it is a Casio. It is analog-digital movement and it does have some higher end functions and says it is water resistant; however, I am disapointed in the fact that it does not have a sweep second hand, and where it says, ""Crystal material: mineral,"" it should really say ""plastic, don't bump or scrape against anything."" Oh, I am wearing it, for now, but I am still looking."
2,so so,"The watch looks good but is a scratch magnet...one scratch on it it looks and it so ugly, I wish it was scratch resistant. I really miss the seconds hand. Navigating menus is a pain, I have been using it more than 4years and even today I am confused on how to use those settings and as always end up looking up in the manual..it is such a pain. I guess the only positive is the battery life it just doesn't want to die."
5,Great watch especially for a traveler!,"I picked this watch out because it has the ""world time"" function. When I travel to a different time zone, this allows me to see the new local time as well as the time at home without any calculations on my part. The band is quite rugged without the watch being heavy. It is a ""mans"" watch."
5,Casio AW81D-1AV great watch and excellent value,"Great looking watch, it performs so many functions, easy to set up, great watch ban and easy to customize the fit.Most of all I bought for the 10 year batteryGod bless, WE Rogers"
4,Ceremic Flat Iron,It arrived on time. I have been using it for the past 4 months now. No problem at all. I have long hair and I finish in usually 10 mins. The only thing is that it may dry your hair out with constant use. So use it with good heat proofing products.
5,Great Product and Service,"My daughter wanted this flat iron for Christmas. We not only found the one she wanted, it cost less and shipped right away. She has used it everyday since she got it. Thanks for such great service."
5,SS-Chi Pink Flat Iron,The item arrived in a reasonable amount of time and it was as expected. The item works well and the price for the Chi Flat Iron is amazing.
3,Chi Review,This product does not work as well as other Chi flat irons we have owned especially for my longer hair. Disappointing. We did receive it promptly from Amazon and it was in perfect condition.
1,Caution,I received the item after a long wait and it does not work. Will not turn on. No response to multiply emails for refund. I have been trying to make contact for weeks. Don't buy from these guys.
1,not as advertised!,I ordered this iron and was surprised to read the information that came with it. It says heats to 80-200 degrees. Not the 410 degress they claim. It's a total rip off and I would suggest you stay far away. They didn't answer my email and their phone says closed due to family emergency!! Sounds fishy to me! Waiting for the time period so I can file a false advertising claim with amazon!
2,Kind of Dissapointed,"I thought it was going to be really good, but it works just as well as my new $30 straightner."
4,I would definitely recommend this Chi,"I have very thick slightly coarse hair. By using my new Pink Chistraightener, my hair has never been straighter. The only thingI would change would be for it to have an automatic shut off."
1,DOES NOT RUN ON MAC OS X (False Advertising),"Myst (Mac) is falsely advertised as able to run on Mac operating systems 7 or higher. IT WILL NOT RUN ON THE LASTEST MAC OS X. You'd have to install an earlier operating system and disable the current one, which would be crazy."
1,DOES NOT WORK ON MAC OS X,"I've been wanting to re-play this game for a long time now. So I was excited when it finally arrived in the mail. But when I put the disk in to my MacBook Pro, nothing happened. I tried for an hour trying to install it with no success. I checked several forums on the internet, hoping to find a solution, only to discover that this game doesn't work on Mac OS X systems! My computer is too NEW for it to run. If anybody has gotten this game to work on Mac OS X please let me know how you did it."
4,None like it!,"I have played only one game I have enjoyed more than Myst (and it too was made by Cyan). This game offers an involving and mindstretching alternative to the 3D bloodfests that currently dominate the computer gaming market. Beautifully rendered worlds, convincing sound effects, and an eerie score only add to this classic. Mac users: Be on the lookout for Myst Masterpiece Edition and Myst Dimensions (Myst in realtime) to come out soon. If you know you want Myst and want the best experience, wait for one of these titles. However if you are new to the D'ni universe, pick this original up for a great price for such an endearing game. By the way, they don't put this in the system requirements, but you need more patience to play this than most games. However it is much more rewarding."
4,One of the best mind games of all time!,Over a period of six years this game has boggled many people and has taken a long time to figure out by the average person. I played many mind type strategy games and this one has given me the challange of them all. I would recommend this game to just about anybody.
3,Fun until you beat it then you might as well toss it...,"This game was great fun. It was challenging but once we found the answer to the whole game, whats the point in playing it again? It just got really old, really fast once we knew the answers. I would only recommend this one if you plan on giving it away when you are done and have the money to blow."
2,Myst for iMac,"Received in reason time. The package was intact but the disk case was broken at it hinges.When I tried to install the program it was not compatible with my system. I sent it back.I am not worried if I don't get my money back, but I don't think I will try Ubisoft again"
2,Very Overrated,Why does everybody rave about how great this game is? I really don't think it is so wonderful. It gets boring after you play it for ten minutes. This was a waste of money.
5,The Best!,"If you are looking for a good introduction of the thought of Plotinus, an important but often overlooked Greek neoplatonist, look no further. O'Meara's book concisely but completely outlines the main principles of this Greek philosopher, and organizes this book around the main features of his philosophy.What makes this tome so valuable is not the explanation of Plotinus' thought, which is unequal, but that O'Meara provides the philosophical background of these principal philosophical issue, explaining the positions taken by Aristotle, the Stoics, the Epicureans, the Middle Platonists, and, of course, Plato, and provides the resolution offered by Plotinus. Invaluable for a student of philosophy or the general reader."
4,Good and biiiiig...,"I bought this set on sale at a local store for almost half the price amazon is offering right now. The tools have a good feel and they are well made, the only problem is that they are kind of big even for my big hands. The spoon has some scratches at the tip after only a few uses on nonstick pans. The canister is big and nice looking with plenty of space for more utensils."
4,SURPRISED,"I enjoy History's Channel 360 dvd's. I own three of them. When I ordered World War II 360 I thought it was about the complete war. Alas, I did not check into it further. It is about the aircraft carrier Enterprise and General Patton. It is actually quite good and I would have given it 5 stars, but I already own Enterprise 360 and General Patton. My fault for not reading all the information on what it's about. But if your a history buff and like WWII,and do not own the others, this is excellent dvd to own."
4,Well done,"Overall these are well done and enjoyable. My teenage grandson enjoys them. Purists on this site have found fault, saying there are errors. They should state what those are, because the rest of us have not spent every waking hour studying the minutiae of WWII."
5,WW2. 360 Blu Ray,This is a fantastic Documentary.It had the whole story about the Enterprises and Patton.It dedicates the fighting men of the Army and Navy
4,Talented,"This CD is not quite as good as Autumn Leaves, but it has good arrangements and music. Fortunato does a fine job."
5,"Really good story, wish they continued it :D",The Legend of Chun HyangLegend of Chun Hyang 1I enjoyed this book very very much. The art is beautiful and the story very interesting. I wish there was more to read. It is a wonderful read and the characters are very lovable.
3,hmm,"this was not one of my favorite CLAMP mangas, all though I did love the art, it was just the story that I didnt fall in love with. it was pretty good though, not horrible at all."
4,Very Good Book,"This is my first bought Clamp book and i'm very glad for buying it. As always, Clamp's Art is beautiful and the main guy is very hot (ponytail). It's a single book so you one have to buy the one, Altough I wouldn't mind if it was a series cuz its REALLY good. The only thing about it is that theres no kissing *pout*, thats why I gave it a four. But theres great romantic comedy between Chun Hyang and the hot guy (forgot his name). This book also has a few very sad scenes, but its all good 'cuz it makes you love the characters more. Sorry if im not making sense and sorry for my lack of grammer. But, anyway, I recommend this to anyone who doesn't collect books just for kissing scenes. Ja!"
3,"There is only one book in this ""series""","CLAMP only wrote one book. There weren't any other volumes published even in Japan. I would guess that it either wasn't supported there or was not looked upon favorably by the entire CLAMP staff. This one volume work was published quite a while ago, and therefore will most likely never be continued.I haven't actually read this book, although I do own the Japanese version. I plan to read the English version sometime this year, but at the moment it isn't on the top of my list of priorities. So please disregard my rating of this book. I just couldn't resist informing others that there really is only one volume in this series."
5,This book is just great!,"Just loved it! A wonderful and inspiring read! `Happiness Is' succeeds in humanizing every persons quest for lasting happiness with sensitivity, compassion and humor. I found the generous anecdotes and shared insights from the Dr. Shea's experiences to be enormously reassuring and joyfully easy to identify with.Dr. Shea's skillful use of metaphors, woven with history (both distant and more recent) serves to move the more complex messages of the book into form - `life' - on many so levels. This book is a jewel, and was just as moving (if not more so) the second time through. Everyone should read this book!!!!"
5,perfect gift !,"a finger snapping, toe tapping, must-have jazzified collection of childhood favorite tunes that you'll want to jam to with your own (inner)kid!"
3,"Great design, but poor durability on some parts","We opened this castle on christmas day and were disappointed to see some parts were broken. The drawbridge and flag is particle board, which were broken, and made of particle board. the other parts of the castle are wood. great design, but poor choice of materials for the drawbridge, which is weight bearing when kids play with it. We love the layout of the castle. It looks like a lot of fun, but returned it due to the drawbridge."
5,VERY COOL!,"I bought this for my 6 year old for Christmas and he loves it! We all love it. Hours of imaginative play, and it is sturdy."
3,DreamWeaver 2,"I think that all people who bought the previous Dreamweaver Bible should get an up-grade price on the new version, if you have the 2 book, although the new stuff in 3 is essential to know, and covered here like nowhere else, there is too much reprint of the older book. If you donot have Dreamweaver 2 Bible, then give this book 5 stars, well done book. Nobody covers the customization features built into the program like this, excellent"
2,Dreamweaver Basics,"This book was a disappointment in that I expected it to cover more advanced issues and applications of the software. Instead, it merely covers the absolute basics of HTML, setting preferences, etcetera-toooo simple. I already have books on HTML and every other web component and didn't need a review of the absolute basics. I wanted an in depth Dreamweaver""Bible"" and this is not what this book is. Sure there are a few tips here and there-things you may not have known-but to call this one a bible is a stretch of the truth."
4,Excellent for the beginner who wants to become an expert....,"I am relatively new to the world of web design and had never seen Dreamweaver before, let alone known how to use it. I am only halfway through the book right now but I feel safe saying that it is an excellent book. It is well laid out and full of information including notes, tips, warnings, and other tidbits to keep you wanting more. I really enjoy this book and am already looking into getting other ""Bible"" books if they are near as good as this one. The only reason I gave the book 4 stars is that I haven't read any other books on Dreamweaver and I am new to the program. But if you are anything like me, it's definately deserving of 5 stars! Hope you enjoy it."
3,A good idea...,"...but it didn't follow through. The plot was very confusing and the interaction between the characters was hard to follow. However, the book is interesting enough to hold your attention until the end."
2,"Sony 2HD 3.5"" Floppy Disks (25-Pack)","So far one dud, had hopes that these would be better than the Imation that I buy locally, seems that quality floppies are a hit/miss item...."
5,really great,I would highly recommend anyone trying to learn Biblical Greek to purchase the workbook and the textboook; they really work well together.
5,well thought out,"This workbook corresponds very well to the grammar. All of the vocabulary in the exercises has already been learned in the grammar; or, if it something that hasn't been covered yet, it is footnoted and explained or defined. The exercises are not so hard that they become discouraging; yet they do give a challenge as you progress through each section and help you learn the things you studied in the grammar chapter."
5,excellent grammar,As I now this is one of the best grammar books for biblical greek.For me it was very helpfull but you need practice for learning biblical greek. More than half of this book is with verbs.
4,Basics of Biblical Greek Workbook,This workbook gives an added advange to those who use it with the text. It covers every aspect of the principles of Biblical Greek. It gives the student drilling exercises to read review and repeat all the steps to the basics of Greek. It helped me to form a firm foundation in my Greek studies and it will do the same for all who apply its easy to use format.
5,Answer key available for free download,"This accessible book is now even more useful for home-learners like me, because the answers are available for download at http://www.teknia.com/index.php?page=product06 . With the ability to monitor one's own work, this is now an excellent resource for independent study. [It should go without saying that if one uses this book in the context of an official course, one should have the instructor's permission to use the answer key!]"
4,applicable and accessible,"My experiences with foreign language and grammar in high-school caused me to be highly apprehensive about learning biblical Greek. Mounce, however, has made this textbook so thorough and logical that all of my worries have been belayed, and I am getting high marks in Greek 1."
3,Ehh...,"I would say that Mounce does a decent job with this textbook, and it has made learning Greek a little easier than I expected. I like the way that Mounce does not attempt to learn nouns and verbs at the same time. I find it helpful that he splits these into different sections. Some people may not like that, but I have found it less confusing than doing both at once. However, in this second edition he has made some addtions that are really more of a hindrance than a help. For example, one of the reasons that the first edition was so good was that all the examples and exercises were taken straight from the New Testament or Septuagent, but Mounce has added his own sentences in this one, and some of them are not helpful."
4,A vital companion to Mounce's text...,"I cannot imagine trying to learn Greek without a workbook. For my first two quarters of basic Greek grammar, we used William Mounce's textbook and this accompanying workbook. Much of what I learned during these courses came from the tedious process of plowing through seemingly endless exercises in this workbook. But I think it is essential labor.Of course, the Mounce workbook is directly tied to the textbook, so I think it would lose much of its value if used independently or with another textbook. But for anyone using Mounce's text as a starting point, use this workbook, as well."
2,AND I THOUGHT THE CRUSADES OF FEMINISM WERE OVER.......,"Throuugh a great desire for truth of the cherokee history, I would of rather had an experience in picketing on a local feminism rally for ""Red Rights"". Insightful and wity were my initial reactions (not to discredit her eloquence) but the repetative nature of relaying her thesis was a bit tedious. I am a great fan of oral tradition when it passive-aggressively reiterated. The persuasion lacks when it is shuved down your throat. Equilibrium of cherokee culture was identified under irrational means of a chip on Perdue's shoulder. To elaborate on the up-side, it is full of actuality (in disguise)."

2,Poor poor graphics and sound,This game was probably great 3-4 years ago but is now totally outdated. I would recommend this game for those with real old computers since the needed requirements are so low. (It is mildly entertaining though so it might be worth your money though it depends on the type of person you are) I personally hated it since I had played so many better games.
3,"Neat game, but beware packaging","The game is fun, and I didn't mind it being dated. But beware: they pack the CD partially exposed on the OUTSIDE of the box (look closely at the picture--that's the REAL CD on the front of the box!), so it's easily damaged. Save that receipt!"
5,Nothing comes close to the original,"I havent played prince of percia 3d yeat. But If u ask me about the first Prince of Percia I will tell u that, that is the best game I have ever played, even though it is 11 years old. I have newer got to the 12th level. I got stranded on the 8th and havent played since."
1,Hate it with a passion,"This gas is the worst product I have ever owned. It's impossible to use without spilling gas everywhere. It gets on my hands, my feet, and the driveway before any gets in the lawnmower. A single star is infinitely too generous for such a disaster of a gas can."
2,"Better Than Others, But Still Pretty Bad","This Blitz gas can is better than theScepter 2.5-Gallon Fuel Canthat I replaced, in that I don't need to remove the nozzle entirely and use a funnel like I did with the Scepter. The Scepter can had a complicated mechanism whereby you had to turn some lock thing at nozzle base; with the Blitz, you pretty much just lean the nozzle tip on the edge of the gas tank and tilt the can. However, I do still spill some gasoline when filling up my lawnmower, negating the alleged eco-benefits of this California Air Resources Board-mandated nozzle design. It would be nice if my state ignored regulations from a government quite literally on the other side of the country, but whatever.Blitz products are made in the United States, which is really the best thing I can say about this gas can."
1,Want 0% gas in car and 100% on the street? Buy this!,"Mind bogglingly stupid design, could not possibly have been tested with real cars. The nozzle is too short and too large in diameter to work with cars that run on unleaded gas. How these guys could screw up something as simple as a gas can is unimaginable. The poorest design for any product I've even used in my life. Thankfully I borrowed it from a friend and didn't buy it myself. He tried to warn me..."
1,Can I give this 0 stars?,"The pour is bad. Bad. While self-venting is nice, the nozzle on this can sprays gas all over during the pour and the pour is slow. To make matters worse, the spout is rigid and getting the right angle to the mower is frustrating. I thought maybe I would have better luck with a second unit, but it seems this is a design problem. I cannot under any circumstance recommend this can for any use. This can seems to have somehow bypassed any user acceptance testing or management needed to just get the product out the door. Blitz has my money. I hope they use it on better product developement; especially since their sales team has gone bonkers in my area and this is about the only thing you can find on the shelves."
1,Lasted more than a week DANGEROUS,Mine was okay until it split along the plastic weld on top because there is no air vent. Yes it does leak and the nozzle can break. I agree with all the others that are disappointed with this poorly designed gas can. If it split on the bottom there would have been gas everywhere.
3,FYI,"The EPA intended this new design to cut down on spills and emissions, but my first attempt to use this can resulted in me spilling more gas than I ever did with the old design. When I went to the Blitz web site to complain, I found the proper instructions on using the can.In a nutshell:1) The spout is not intended to go back in the can after each use. You should leave it attached outside. The valve will prevent the vapor from escaping. Yup, not the best design for transporting.2) You need to remove the rubber gasket from its position when you first bought it and make sure it is between the spout and can. This will prevent leaking from the collar area.My can lacked instructions, so I naturally tried to use this can like the old design, and that's when the spills occurred.Hope this helps others!"
1,Terrible design. Promotes spills.,"This product is supposed to be spill-proof. Are you kidding me? It seems to me that the goal of the brilliant engineers who came up with this design was to make it guaranteed to spill! This can is very difficult to use, and you will ALWAYS leak gas everywhere, all over your hands, your shoes, and whatever you're trying to put gas into. This product should be banned, the people who designed it should be canned, and everyone who bought one of these should be paid $100 for the frustration they've suffered. Fail. I know the EPA required some of this new design, but they are being overprotective of the idiots who don't have enough IQ points to be using a gas can in the first place."
1,Designed by a committee?,"This is a lovely example of something designed by a committee. The old joke is that a camel is a horse designed by a committee. How could they possibly describe this as spill PROOF? I had to give up and resort to a funnel, which is exactly what they were trying to get away from. The moment fuel started to flow it vapor locked and gushed out over everything I tried. I tried on a couple of other things with similar effect. I eventually found a long clear tube filler, now that will fill anything with control and without spills.Perhaps somewhere there's a single person who designed this and knows exactly how to get it to work perfectly, but for the rest of us I'd strongly advise against it."
2,Sleeper,"I found this painfully dull to read. The descriptive just went on and on. Do we really need to know how much time each member spends in the restroom, etc? I kept reading anyway to find that maybe something cool would happen and it never really did for me."
5,Intriguing,My autistic son spends hours on this game making different animals and finds it extremely entertaining (and funny!) It's a pretty simple program to use and helps build imagination skills. I would recommend this product for any child that loves animals.
1,Not worth it,"Pros: 1)it rollsCons:1)The most upright seat position is still too reclined. My kids wind up pulling themselves forward to see.2)The knee-to-foot distance is too short for my short 2 yr olds. The foot rest is too narrow & too shallow - their shoes unintentionally drag the tire.3)The foot brakes can appear to be locked even when they aren't.4)Even when they're buckled-in, my kids can tough the back tires. If they wiggle loose from shoulder harness (easy to do), they can touch the front tire with their hands.5)I kick the axle during long strides. Also,the handle is too short (I'm only 5'6"")6)It provides quite a bumpy ride7)The plastic rims make it difficult (impossible for us) to find & install replacement tires8)I gave it away!"
4,Good stuff...but a lot of pills to swallow,"Buy this product for it's quality, however be aware that you have to take 7 pills to equate to one full serving of dark leafy greens. I bought this because some members of my family can't stand the smell/taste of fresh wheat grass. I personally get more of boost from the fresh stuff, however - if you can't stomach that - this product is a decent proxy."
3,Call to Battle,"The power of the Scottish drums and bagpipes is truly at a high point in this collection. For those seeking soulful sounds, stay clear, this album is all about the Scottish pide. A wonderful rendition of Scotland the Brave is by far the highlight."
4,"Concise, Sharp and Suggestive","This short book covers more ground than most twice its length. Talisse argues that popular forms of liberalism (Rawls, Rorty, Galston) cannot meet their own standard of neutral justification. He then offers a fascinating epistemological defense of democracy. My only complaint is this book could have been longer. Sometimes the arguments move very quickly and the conclusions in the final chapter could have been expanded. But as it is, this book is lean and to the point."
1,Geez can this ship any slower?,"The product is fine as usually everything I get from Parts Express is but why do they call themselves ""Express"". Everything I've ever ordered from them take forever to arrive. And shipping for them is already high enough as it is. I had to wait almost 14 days to get 2 pieces of plastic are you kidding me?"
5,It's just a sheet,"It's exactly the size and thckness advertised. It's also black and textured on one side. It just is what it is. It did come wrapped as if it were electronics, so check...well packaged...too.John"
5,It was what I needed,"Textured one side, smooth and glossy the other. Heat-formed very well. Seems to be holding up well, so no complaints"
2,Very disappointing!,"Sybex books still leave much to be desired and Windows XP Processonal Complete also falls into that category. It isn't worth even the sale price of $13.99!I wanted to learn how to delete some programs from the start menu. The programs I was looking for were not in the start menu and there is no reference to be found in the Sybex as to what to do. A free daily ""Kim Komando Tip of the Day"" had the simple answer -- go to ""Run"", type in msconfig and go to the appropriate tab and uncheck the programs you don't want to have start up. After reading this tip, I then researched the Sybex book and there is no reference in its over 1046 pages about ""msconfig""! There are other things that I have attempted to research and they are not be be found in this Sybex book.I recommend that you spend a few more dollars and buy other an Sybex books."
1,"""10 year"" battery lasted 18 months",I bought this because of the purported battery life. Mine fell well short of ten years.
1,chelsea watch sucks big time!!!!!!!!!,chelsea watch sent me this watch which had scratches all over.....i thought i m buying a new watch....i paid for the new one and got this scratched watch.....i tried to contact them but of no use....they never replied back.....will never buy again from chelsea or amazon......
4,good watch for such a price.,its light in weight comparatively...but improvement is required regarding the illumination...its a yellow light which reminds of the old days...not good in this new fast moving generation.please improve the illumination...please please please...rest...the product is good...liked it
4,Keep the book handy,"This is a great watch. It has everything I want minus a calculator ( no biggy ). I'm not a flashy person, but I'm proud to show it. To me, it's stylish. It gives you digital, chronological, world, daylight savings time and many other features that you must keep the book handy to make accessing them easier; particularly when it comes to resetting daylight savings time or when you change time zones. The lens is fairly scratch-resisant. Would I buy another ? Yes. My only other concern is that it doesn't come wth an expandable band."
1,Do NOT buy this item,"Bought this watch last year , the battery died in less than 2 months. It has a battery warranty of ""10 years"". Complete waste of money."
4,30-Minute Meals 2,"Great book and recipies. However, I need more simple recipes. I should have purchased 30 Minute Meals-1."
3,Great for a beginner cook,I purchased this book both for my boss that does not have much time with her family and a friend that is just passing her hamburger helper stage of her culinary experience. Both loved this book and claim to use it.
2,It's Okay,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter who is a very busy career woman, mother and wife. There are a lot of ingredients that are not common in a kitchen cupboard. Although the cookbook tells you where to get the ingredients, my daughter doesn't have time to run all over town gathering them up like she is on a scavenger hunt. Thus it looses the 30 minute meal preparation to us. The recipes are okay otherwise what few she has had a chance to prepare. If you like going from shop to shop picking up ingredients this is the recipe book for you. If you want ingredients that you can get at your local grocery store, I don't recommend this book."
3,ONLY THE SEQUAL TO THE GODFATHER ECLIPSED THE ORIGINAL,"Love Rachel and her cooking show. She enjoys food and entertaining on a dime. Her chatter as she cooks always leaves a nugget or two of cooking jargon or info I didn't know beforehand. Hate to harp, but sure would enjoy more pictures to whet my appetite while reading."
4,Great easy recipes,"I picked up this book because I enjoy the show. We have used several of the recipes for the past couple weeks, and have enjoyed each one. I served a pasta salad at a picnic and everyone wanted the recipe. I think that some of the recipes need tweeking and they do take a tad longer then 30 minutes, unless you move really fast."
4,30 Minute Meals 2,"The soups are so good.I love the Potato,Spinach and Tomato Soup.I used my own Tomato'a out of my garden for this one.I had people over for dinner used it as a starter.I told my friends where to get the book.I may even give them as Christmas gift."
3,Where does she shop?,"There are some good recipes in here but I can't get most of her ""common ingredients"" at my local supermarket!"
3,Longer than 30-Minute Meals,"The problem with this cookbook is that, although many of the recipes are quite good, they generally take longer than 30 minutes to prepare. Perhaps they take 30 minutes if you are a professional cook. I agree with other reviewers that the show is better. That is why I have not purchased any more of her cookbooks. That and the fact that she became a spokesperson for Dunkin Donuts. Seriously??!? She doesn't earn enough money from her shows and prolific new cookbooks? I feel like she sold out."
5,I love this book,I love this book because it really only take 30 minutes to cook a nice meal. the recipe are very nice and even tasty ! I would recommend it.I also bought simple and simply delicious by sylvie rocher which is also a great book.
4,Great book for a novice!,"I love Rachael Ray! I watch her show (2x each day) and her cookbooks are wonderful!One person wrote, that teaspoons and tablespoons are gadgets and that her recipes call for more of these ""gadgets"" thus being a negative point in these books. I have to disagree. Everyone should have these types of spoons in their cupboard. Aren't these staples of a traditional kitchen?? These books are great and easy to follow. They are worth your money and time."
4,Food 911 Rachel Style!,"Being a devoted fan of Rachel's show, I was sure to be biased about her book. However, after watching her show regularly to learn time-saving tricks and buying the book, I can honestly say her recipes have made my life easier. They are budget conscious, the ingredients are easy to find, and they are always very tasty. At first it was taking me longer than thirty minutes to prepare her recipes, but after some practice and perseverance, I've got it down. Just a tip - she does point out in the book that the recipes are placed in the order they should be cooked in, so if you follow that it's much easier to bring everything together at once in thirty minutes."
4,30-Minute Meals Delivers,"We struck gold on the very first recipe so ""30-Minute Meals 2"" already meets my criteria for a valuable cookbook.Anyone can cook from the simply written recipes. It may take longer than thirty minutes the first time but successive efforts will go much faster and likely hit the promised thirty minute target.For my busy family Rachel Ray's book delivers on its promise. Hey, it takes 30 minutes just to order and pick up a take-out meal that is cold by the time it is served. Cooking at home means we know EXACTLY what is in our food plus it is fresh. What could be better?"
2,Who eats stuff like this?,"With the great, easy meals she makes on her show, I don't know why this wouldn't be the same. I'm not happy with this cookbook. I checked-out her other cookbooks from the library and enjoyed them so I bought this one. What a disappointment."
1,No list of recipes in table of contents and No pictures,"I am really disappointed with this book. My wife and I bought this book since we watch Rachael Ray's show on TV.However, this book does not even list all the recipes in the table of contents. Instead it just lists the 4 or 5 parts that are in the book (example: dinner specials etc). So, there is no way to find a particular recipe that you are interested in.Furthermore, there are no pictures to go with the recipes. So, you have little idea what the final product is going to look like (or more importantly, should look like).I don't recommend this book to anyone, till Rachael Ray learns to write (or rather finds a writer who knows how to compile a cook book for her)."
1,I'd rather eat Fast Food than this crap!,"Someone please stop Rachael Ray from publishing anymore books or heading another Food Network program. The network dropped the online bulletin board for Ms. Ray bacause of negative feedback. They persist with her shows in an attempt to gain a ""younger demographic."" She lacks any culinary talent and is unwatchable on TV. If your idea of great food extends beyond a can of mushroom soup added to whatever you have on hand in the frig, then pass this one up."
5,Rachael makes cooking fun!,"I never knew I had the capacity to find such joy in cooking until I was inspired by Rachael Ray and her 30 minute meals. Her style suits me perfectly. After a day at work, I like to move quickly in the kitchen, and whip a nice meal together in minimal time. Love to use basic everyday items and fewer ingredients, yet have a healthful, flavorful, and interesting meal. I was dry on dinner ideas when I discovered Rachael Ray's show. Now I get excited to cook a meal. My husband and son have appreciated the results. This book has been a source of many new favorites."
4,Good buy!!,"These books were Christmas gifts for my grand-daughters, both married withcareers and Rachael's quick meals will be a great help to them."
4,"GREAT Recipies, Not Necessarily for Every Night","The recipes are easy, quick, convenient and WONDERFUL to the taste! She has some great shortcuts and you end up using ingredients you have never heard of before. Definately great for entertaining as well. However, most of the recipies include alot of heavy milks and butters and aren't necessarily figure-friendly... so I wouldn't advise eating these meals every night..."
4,You can do it faster!,I'm Italian and a quite good cooker. I saw racherl ray for the fist time in tv a couple of year ago while I was studyng at University in USA. I love her cause she makes quality food but I do think she needs too many ingredients for her receipes! I can cook a good carbonara or bolognese in less than 20 minutes just because in the original receipe there are only few ingredients. Buy this book cause it's a good guide but try to personalize it adding or not using ingredients.
3,"Okay, but not too many good for you choices","This was my first Rachael Ray cookbook, and I have to say that many of the items sound good when you read the title, but I haven't been all that impressed with the actual dishes. I've also had a hard time with the fact that there are not many recipes in this cookbook that are actually good for you- they are recipes for moderation, but not everyday choices."
1,Bad Book,"I had high expectations when I bought this book. Boy, was I wrong. I made only two meals and never used the book again. It's in my pile to donate. I firmly beleive that Rachael is the only one who likes her cooking. I'd never buy another book of hers again."
2,Disappointed,"The first meal I cooked took over an hour. I'm a bit discouraged but I'm hoping her other meals won't take as long. (It was the noodle soup with crab spring rolls meal - FYI, one out of 2 liked the meal.) The delay probably had to do with the fact that I didn't ""wash the produce after my big grocery trip."" It has been my experience that many recipes (excluding Rachael Ray's) that claim to take under 45 minutes, usually do and they take into account preparations including washing veggies, defrosting, etc.It turns out that I'm not a fan of this book anyway. What I expected was more of a step-by-step guide on how to juggle several dishes on the stove at once. Something like, while the appetizer veggies are sauteeing for 10 minutes, begin browning the chicken from the other recipe. The only reason why I bought her book was to learn how to juggle a couple of recipes at a time and have it cooked and on the table in about 30 minutes."
1,Yuck,"I can't stand everything about Rachael Ray. She's obnoxious, loud and fake. She pretends to eat food on television and acts like it's the most delicious thing she's ever tasted. I think you need to eat more than a bean to determine the level of deliciousness, Rachael. And I don't think you can determine deliciousness when someone else has removed the food for you. On one episode my mom was watching, she went to take a bite of her muffin, but the camera angle showed that the bite had been taken out for her! She's not a real chef, and she's a mediocre cook."
4,Lovely Smell,"I quite like this perfume, it is not suitable for daytime wear however because it is quite strong, but the fragrance is lovely, good for date night."
2,COnfused,Iam confused. I had ordered white shoulders by elizabeth arden for women and i got white shoulders by evyan. is it the same or is this just some way to deceive people??
3,not shabby,i felt the questions in the book were easier than those given on the bar but they give you a good idea of whats to come.
3,Mediocre,"This book is decent but not quite ""as advertised."" The description claims it has 550 practice questions per subject, but in reality it has nowhere near that. In addition, the book is FULL of typos...missing words, misspelled words, etc. The questions are helpful but not like the actual Bar Exam. Rather than giving people names, each question simply refers to people as ""the defendant,"" ""the victim,"" ""the neighbor,"" etc. Still good practice, but not particularly authentic."
5,Excellent approach for bar study,"Great overview of the MBE questions, covering the types of questions you will see, as well as strategies to help you address them. The explanations for the answers are very helpful. I used this book as a supplement to BarBri. Instead of paying big bucks for PMBR, I worked through the sample questions in this book and listened to the Madonna Ray of Light album. I passed, and I saved a lot of money. I highly recommend both this book and the Ray of Light album for anyone studying for the bar."
5,Very Good!,I am finding this book very useful for bar study. The book has been recommended by many people as a good study guide with realistic bar questions. The reviews of the subjects are concise and easily digestable and I found the pointers/tips in the introduction really helpful throughout the exam. Just wish I'd gotten my hands on this book earlier in the game.(Plus I received the book in very good condition and before expected)
4,A good explanatory tool,"I think this will be useful. The questions appear to be a little easier and longer in some cases than what has been on the MBE lately. The book arrived very quickly and was in very good condition. There are quite a few examples for each subject (although in a few cases in the intro material, you are not told what the correct answer is). You are alerted about what topics to concentrate on."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"I ordered this book to supplement my Kaplan review course. It really was a waste. The content was correct, but the same stuff was included in the review course I paid for. I simply bought the information twice. My advice is to pick this book up in the latter 2L or early 3L years as a warm up to the MBE. I didn't look at it after I started my bar review course and I already knew most of the material."
2,Not as described,The book was not in the condition it was described. I should have bought a new one for 10$ more.
3,Good review book,"I am finding this book very useful for bar study. The book has been recommended by many people at my school as a good study guide with realistic bar questions. After doing research it seemed like the newest edition would be the best to prep for the July 2010 bar as the older edition was published a few years earlier. The explanations are clear and the sample problems are quite challenging.However, a word of caution. This edition of the book is not very well edited. There are some answer explanations that are clearly incomplete (missing explanations of one or two answers) and numerous typos. Sometimes sentences just end or are out of context without explanation. I do not find that this is a poor study guide at all but the typos make me wonder if all the information is correct."
1,Laborious read,"The main character in the book, Melissa, is truly an idiot. While traveling alone through Europe she is stalked - and she is very aware that she is being stalked. Instead of seeking help from the police or the American embassy, she moons about town dreaming of a man she knew for only a few days. When she finally walks out of her dream world into the traffic of reality, she is hit by a truck even a possum would have avoided.Maybe this is an accurate portrait of someone seeking a self - I don't know. But I do know that psychiatrists get paid for wading trough this kind of drivel.If you must read, get the Cliff Notes version."
2,Disappointing,"I have long been an avid reader and supporter of Dorothy Gillman's' work and have enjoyed every book until I read this one. This book is about a pitiful woman trying to get her life back on track, but all she does is whine and feel sorry for her past, present and future life. Nearly the entire story is filled with her self-doubt and insecurities. She is afraid of everything and nearly everyone. I believe this could have been established without beating us over the head with her continual annoying repeated ""woe is me dialogue"". I had a hard time just finishing this book and the ending leaves a lot to be desired.I will still read Ms. Gilman's' work, but wish had not purchased this book - it will forever make me wonder, when I read one of her books, if I will regret getting it.If you aren't into self-loathing then pick up the Mrs. Pollifax series and have fun escaping. (The reason I pick up mysteries in the first place)."
2,Disappointing effort,"I have read and enjoyed most of Dorothy Gilman's novels. This is the only one that I would not recommend. The plot is disappointing and the characters fall far short of compelling. Ah well, perhaps 1967 just wasn't such a great year after all..."
1,The worst Dorothy Gilman book I have ever read.,"I have read most of Dorothy Gilman's books and loved them. I especially enjoyed the ""Mrs. Pollifax"" series. However, I have found ""Uncertain Voyage"" to be the worst Dorothy Gilman book I have ever read. I have read 142 pages of it so far...thinking with each page that I read the next one will be better, but it is so boring I don't know if I will be able to finish it. Melissa is so cocerned with her past nervous break down and Adam there is hardly time for anything else. Basically it is just very predictable. There no twist and turns or surprises in it. If you have ever read a mystery novel you know how it ends almost from the begining. Some people may love the book. However, I do not think it was worth buying brand new. In my opion it might be worth buying it used for 25 cents or less, but only if you are desperate to find something to read."
2,not ordinary,"I love the format of this DVD. You have 5 sessions of 20 minutes each, both am and pm workouts. The fact that you can set them up to play as a customized sequence is fantastic, all yoga DVD's should be set up this way. The bad news is I do not care for Shiva's style of constant moving and wiggling. I like the linear aspect of yoga and I am afraid I will hurt my back or pull a muscle with this wiggling motion. Not my favorite,"
2,Disappointed,"I was looking for a yoga dvd that is different from what I have ...something that is not an instructor working with someone as well as a dvd where you have the option to do less than 60 min for when you are short on time. I thought this dvd would fulfill these wishes as well as be a nice challenge. Well, this is definitely a challenge, but not the challenge I was looking for - this is very hard to follow along with. I have found in the short time I've had the dvd that I am constantly looking to see what she is doing next. I have found that she moves on to the next pose sometimes wi/o informing you. For me, this dvd has been a waste of $$."
2,What it missed out on mentioning,"Around 10,000 years ago a bunch of Syrian farmers left the Middle East and settled in Europe including what is now Ireland. The book never mentions the fact that all Irish are somewhat of Syrian background from 10 millenia ago. Check out the Journey of Man by Spencer Wells for more on this Syrian neolithic migration."
4,Fascinating Look at Ireland,"Reading this book at times I felt like I had been transported to this magic island and at times I was shocked to read of its bloody history throughout the centuries. While I will acknowledge this is a general history, it does touch upon a number of milestones in the history of Eire..at first the land of the Celts, then the Roman invasion, then invasions by the Vikings, then the Normans, it seems Ireland has known more than its fair share of war and oppression. It also gave me a better understanding of how Northern Ireland came to be and why there's still strife to this day.And also too the book touches upon the customs and people of Ireland, who are lively and a fiercely proud people. And some of their stories, of the Celts, of St Patrick, of druids, the ""Good People,"" and fierce warriors. There's even a chapter about what to expect if you decide to visit the Enchanted Isle. I want to visit Ireland and this book has brought me a bit closer to that goal."
4,"Easy, interesting read","I found this to be a very interesting book. I couldnt find another History book on Irish culture like it. One of my major in studies is World Cultures, although I found some misrepresentations, the majority of facts seemed accurate, from what I have studied. I am not Irish nor do I have any special study in Irish Culture. This is, as another reviewer noted, a history book you actually want to keep reading. Nice reading, but I would use this book as a beginner book on Irish Culture/History and follow up with another book. (just to compare notes)A great book for anyone with Irish blood to pick up, and discover why they should be proud of their roots, and get a feel for who their ancestors were."
4,A good read,"A well written book that provides an overview of Ireland past, present and future. The author explains the many reasons for the past Irish conflicts with the British, and after reading it you will see why those wounds run deep. The book explains the origins of many Irish customs and how a visitor is likely to encounter them. Overall it was a very easy book to read and provided a very good overview of Irish history and the Irish people."
1,Certainly lives up to its name,"This book I found biased in the extreme. It's yet another tedious screed against the Evil Brits (tm) with the Irish as the MOPE (most oppressed people ever).Massie's scholarship is also questionable. In her account of the battle of Clontarf, she makes a comment on the version given in the Norse Njal's saga as being, basically, Norse propaganda. Unfortunately she also makes a statement that makes it obvious that she has never read Njal's saga. It's OK to be skeptical of sources, but not if you haven't even bothered to read them.Massie evidently entirely on secondary sources like Peter Beresford-Ellis, and also uncritically echoed their prejudices.Better to get Foster's ""Modern Ireland"", or even Tim Pat Coogan's books on the Troubles, if you're seeking to understand the current situation in Ireland Irish history with a wee bit more nuance than the cardboard cut-out good guys vs. bad guys account given here."
1,misinformation,The CD which comes in this case is actually A CD by the same name with the picture of a German Beer maid on the front cover. This is very disappointing because the advertised CD is far superior.
4,Swing Your Beer Steins..,"This CD certainly sets a festive mood and ambience. There is no mistaking the environment created by a rousing Beer Hall. This music turns any event into the Hofbrau Haus. The overall quality of the CD could be improved; however, it basically only adds to the authenticity of the recording ...."
2,All Mixed Up!,"At least one other reviewer has noted a difference between the advertised item and the received item. I actually received this:[...]...which was NOT what I wanted! However, the very low price makes it not worth my time or effort to return or exchange the item.Now, as for the actual received CD: The CD case and the physical CD match, listing 39 tracks...however, I can only find 23 tracks.Tracks 1 - 11 are unique; the rest are duplicates of those tracks."
5,"Intriguing, Mind-Blowing and oh-so-COOL!!",I have our local jazz station to thank for introducing me to the jazz of Michael Davis. The rifts are are a real joy to listen to; Bonetown is really a kick! Listen and you'll be a fan too!
5,My Favorite Pan,I have a complete set of All-Clad LTD that I adore. I bought this pan as an adjunct to it and it is now my favorite pan to use. It is large enough for a whole chicken and is wonderful for stir frying. It is deep enough for sauces and it cleans sooooo easily. I also like the two handles rather than one for lifting. The handles stay surprisingly cool. I would recommend this pan to everyone.
3,fun read.,"It was a fun read, it just wasn't something that I couldn't put down. Parts of it were a little cheesey. sometimes it was alittle slow."
5,Warn Manual hubs - satisfaction,"After trying unsuccessfully in South Africa to locate a set of manual Warn Freewheel hubs to fit my 2001 Kia Sportage as a replacement for the unsatisfactory vacuum-operated units with which the car comes fitted standard, I sourced a set through Amazon, verified they were the right fit (which proved to be true), had them shipped to my son in the USA within 2 days and got them brought to South Africa by a friend. I fitted them myself and have just completed a 2300kms almost entirely off-road trip on holiday which included many kms of Grade 3 trail. Without the hubs I could not have enjoyed such an amazing holiday trip. Great hubs; great service - a pleasure to deal with you guys!"
5,Perfect product,"I installed these hubs on my Sportage in about 10 minutes! They work perfectly, and flawlessly. I have been in several '4 wheel drive only' situations, and have been able to completely depend on these hubs.Original hubs from Kia left me stuck in the woods!"
1,change order,I ordered 1 set of hubs for $121.48 and when they emailed me the order they had charged me of two at $242.96 and would not let me change order 10 minutes after I placed order. Not a happy customer. And of course they give you no easy way to contact them.Warn 60247 Standard Manual Hub Kit
3,Earky Mexican Esquivel,"This recording is for Esquivel enthusiasts only. It is interesting to listen to this and to see the difference with the American RCA recordings. It is in Mono and sounds dated in comparison to Other Worlds Other Sounds or the later recordings. Obviously RCA gave Esquivel access to better recording technology and personnel on the later dates. My favorite Esquivel recording is Four Corners of the World since it mostly piano. Esquivel may have been famous for his orchestra, but he was a mean piano player!!"
1,Missing Book,"I ordered this book from Ms. Korwitts in January of this year. I sent a check to her and have never received my book. I would love to review it, but need to get it from her first. Please let me know her address so I can contact her by telephone. Thank you."
4,Interesting book about an interesting man,"This book gives great insight into this powerful man. He was larger than life, and seemed to remain that way even after the presidency. A great read."
2,Curiosity Kills the Cat,"Too much absinthe, too much opium to make these ravings coherently and cohesively legible.However, central and humorus when thinking special interest or literary curiosity."
1,Poor design,"This belt's buckle is held together by a thin, short piece of metal to allow it to swivel. However, it doesn't just swivel, it starts to twist, then snaps off after a few wears. Every other part of the belt is heavy duty - the leather, the other pieces of the buckle. It is baffling to take it apart and realize that there is no way to fix or replace the buckle. It is trash."
3,Lasted about a year,Lasted almost exactly one year. It wears out and rips at whatever hole you use. I guess it was still worth it for a year.
1,Genuine cardboard leather,"This is a thick, heavy belt.But, after just a few wearings, the holes were so badly torn it was unwearable.The ""leather"" is apparently cardboard with a leather coating.Do not waste your money.I then bought the Dockers belt, also made in China, because this one became obsolete.It has held up much better.I hope Amazon will start selling more merchandise made in the USA."
2,Not a view of the road,"I was looking for a cycling video from the point of view of the cyclist. If you are looking for the same, this video is not for you.While the scenery itself is sometimes pretty, the constant focus on the cyclist does not make you feel as if you are actually on the road. It simply feels as if you are watching someone else. Swift road and viewpoint changes also leave the viewer frustrated and unable to connect with the road.In addition, the producers have added a creepy robotic version of the cyclist in an attempt to help a viewer work out harder, faster, and the like. There is much too much focus on this creepy robot. I think the viewer is more than capable of choosing his or her own speed or tension.Overall, a disappointing video. The effort is there but the execution is lacking. I would recommend the Video Cycle series instead."
1,"Sorry, not what I was expecting","I was expecting moving scenery to give me the illusion of cycling through the landscape. This video is choppy: a few seconds of moving scenery, then a closeup of a pedaling foot, then a cyclist coming toward you, then from the right, then a still shot of scenery (I'm supposed to be moving, why is the scenery still?)No continuity. Gives me no feeling of a journey to distract my mind while my body works.I'll keep looking."
1,Join this century.,The content and video work in this series met expectations.My question is when are they going to move to DVD?I'll not purchase another in this series till then.
5,THE BOMB,"OMG! I LOVE PUBLIC ANNOUNCMENT. FELLONI,IS THE ONE.ALL WORK & NO PLAY IS AWESOME TOO.I GOT ALL 3 ALBUMS& WAITING ON THE NEXT.THESE GUYS ARE DEEP& I LUV IT.KEEP IT COMIN. ALL MEN NEED TO HAVE THESE CDS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SMOKE CLEARS."
1,Horrible CD,"I loved Public Announcement's first CD so I went ahead and bought this one. Well, it was horrible! Do not buy it."
2,Average R&B from a group who can do better,"After being eighty sixed by R.Kelly after their 1992 debut, Public Announcement was M.I.A. until 1998 when the group returned with the sexually charged All Work No Play album. After a couple of solo albums the group released their CD which is pretty weak. There aren't noteable slow jams on the disc other than their remake of You Don't Have To Cry. More than likely R.Kelly is drinking a juice box with a little girl and laughing."
2,pretty average,"I was expecting more because I dug that PA Album from 1998,but this Album sounds like Minor League Triple AAA Level takes on R.Kelly at best.there are a few alright joints,but on a whole not much depth here. I expected a bit more.the vocals are cool,but the Production doesn't challenge them too much at all."
2,"good intentions, but they did not live to the game","The promise for this game was awesome. However, even with a very good PC specifically loaded with hardware for games, the Prince of Persia 3D was an unfulfilled promise. That is, the flaws make the game not worth it. I guess the engine game is the one to blame. Interestingly that, designed in 1999, and it could not live to Quake III. The price is extremely hard to control, it does not respond to commands immediately, the camera moves wildly and very difficult to see in enclosed traps, etc. The end, with timed 150 seconds for battling the bad guy is definitely not enough unless you are a master. You work against the controlling of the prince as well as the bad guy. More work could be done to the betterment of this game, but I think the company has discontinued."
3,Good game but...,"Over all the game is good but there are some technical problems with the game. First - When I am playing the game, it just stops and it will return to windows, I need to restart the game which takes lot of time. Second - There was one place in the game where an object does not behave as it should (to be precise - a rock like thing that goes up and down on which prince jumps). For that I need to restart the game which is frustrating. Also it took me lot of time to figure it out. Third - Loading of the game is also very very slow. Fourth - When the price reaches the final combat (I think this has limited time) quick save does not work properply. When time expires, a cinematic is shown and main menu displays - at that point of time I could not able to figure out whether the game is over or still some thing is there. As the quick save was not working here properly, loading the game is time consuming which is not appreciated. -And finally $50 is too much for it."

2,content wonderful' quality of tape defective,"This is a wonderful film and I really wanted my own copy, but the tape sent was defective and the tape crashed half way through the film."
3,Moviewatchcrit,"This is a poor quality DVD-R transfer. It seems out of focus. I do not mean double-images but everything has soft edges like a poor quality VHS tape. My three stars go for the film itself, not necessarily the quality of this transfer. This is a good story and I am glad to have it in my collection despite its quality. Not all DVD-R are poor quality. ""The Valley of Decision"", for instance, is very good quality.In addition to its focus problem, this film is well worn. Many splotches throughout."
