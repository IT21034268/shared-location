1,"Oh, Freaky","On that cover photo, is Sandusky making some sort of reference to the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel? Like the Catholic Church doesn't have enough problems. What a freak, I hope some guard at the jail ""neglected"" to take away his belt and shoelaces."
1,APTLY NAMED,"How DISGUSTING is the price-point for this book, listed above?? HUNDREDS of dollars for a copy??What sick, opportunistic morons would sell at a premium the autobiography of a convicted felon??Amazon, you NEED to pull this book IMMEDIATELY. Otherwise, you're proving that you're all about PROFIT and care nothing for child victims."
1,"Go Get Touched, Jerry!","Very touchable portrait of a creature who has touched not just hearts and minds, but parts better left untouched. Touching upon his touch n' go shower deflower stats, this career pedophile, whose low blow record can't be touched, will doubtless need a touch-up, if not a total retouching, of his fouled soul. Helping himself to the helpless has made him a touch flickety-fingered, adding a devilish touch to a hands-on legacy, and making him a soft touch for the hard sell of a sore spot aching to be touched. And therein lies the rubdown, or is it the touchdown? Isn't he touched by the iron grip his touchy-feely legacy has had on the news of late? Good, because if he's touching himself, he won't be touching your ten year old son."
1,Peni State Football,"His ""wife"" never heard the screams from the basement? Please, let there be a secondary round of criminal charges for his enablers and protectors.The gall this invertebrate had to write a self-aggrandizing book about his trap for vulnerable boys makes me want to puke. If he has a shred of dignity left, he'll take his life before burdening tax payers with his upkeep in prison."
1,"""Touched""? Seriously?","This man is a true sociopath. The book's title clearly reflects this. Everyone who let this man carry on through the years should be arraigned and charged. Enjoy being touched in prison, Jerry."
1,WOW,"How ironic is it, that Sandusky's autobiography is named ""Touched,"" what a sick man! Anyone that thinks otherwise, please read the grand jury report. Also, where in the hell was his wife when all of this was happening, I'm pretty sure his wife would have notice that there was something odd about the man. My sympathies go out to all of the victims and their families."
1,SICK F***,There is no greater EVIL on earth than someone who takes advantage of his good fortune to TORTURE AND RUIN the lives of CHILDREN in unfortunate life circumstances. Makes me SICK
1,Sickening Irony,"The fact that is only available ""Leather Bound"" is bad enough. The editorial review notes that he ""as touched the lives of more than 100,000 children"". I can only hope that he soon hears the phrase ""Welcome to genpop""."
1,Thank God this book isn't illustrated...,"When I first heard that Jerry Sandusky was involved in a book called Touched, my first fear was that it would contain full-page photographs, illustations, or pop-up cut-outs depicting full on child rape. Thank God it's just text. Also, I've got to be honest: I expected there to be more information about forced anal."
1,Sick pedophile!!!,Why would you want to list this book??? What a sick pervert - the title says it all! He took advantage of innocent boys... no one can replace their innocence!!!
1,In prison....,Jerry will be the one getting touched. This guy won't make it a year in prison before the other inmates take him out.
5,"""Highly Recommended!"" - NAMBLA","This book cums highly recommended by NAMBLA. Coach Sandusky has proven that he is not only interested in helping young boys become men on the football field, but he takes an interest in their personal hygiene as well. He stands firmly behind all his young future-students. Don't drop the soap, boys."
1,Jerry Sandusky is Satan,"Every boy ""touched"" by Jerry Sandusky went thru unspeakable horror in his hands... and at such tender ages as 10 to 13. All the football staff and the Penn State administration knew that Sandusky was raping little boys, but the whole Penn State organization chose to protect their personal glory and the glory of Penn State, rather than do the right thing. Not one of those adults who knew stood up for the victims. None of them cared about the young boys. They have perverted sports to the lowest dregs. I am so angry it's hard to find the words... My heart bleeds for the young innocents and for their suffering. I pray for justice to be served timely. And I hope every one of the Penn State football staff and administration who chose to look the other way while the rapes were going on, I hope they too would rot in jail together with Sandusky!!"
1,wait for a sequel,"Wait!! Don't buy this book: there is a new book in the works by Jerry Sandusky. It will appear in 3 to 5 years. The working title is ""Touched II: Jerry Sandusky by Big Bad Boys with Tattooed Dicks in a Federal Penitentiary"". In it Jerry is ""horsing around"" with the boys face-to-face, face-to-wall, face-to-floor, face-to-buttocks, and many, many other interesting and unusual positions. It will offer you a better value for your hard earned money than the present drivel."
1,Paterno for Pope,"As I flipped through these pages, I was truly Touched by Sandusky in a very deep place. I felt young again. Sandusky's words penetrated my soul, as I was filled with his insight. I was blown away from the moment I inserted the tip of my finger through the soft cover, until completion. Do yourself a favor and ravish this book, as soon as you can. Seriously, this book raped me. It did..."
1,"AMAZON, PLEASE REMOVE","this book from your website. I am sure you do not want to be any part of the income that this man uses for his defense, which will be lengthy and costly."
1,"Amazon, think on this book","Amazon,you should pull this book. Gutsy, a pedophile naming a book called ""Touched"". Dont help this guy profit from the abuse he was responsible for."
1,Soon to be joined,"By ""Groped: the Herman Cain Story""Please take this off your list, Amazon. I'm in favor of free speech: so let the creep offer his excuses for free. There's nothing in the constitution that says a private corporation has to enable a pedophile to profit from his maundering. Leave up the title so those of us who are completely disgusted can continue to vent our outrage. Just make it ""unavailable""."
1,Wait... so it's about football?,I'm so lost. I was reading about it on [..] and they said it was about football. Feel as if I've been had by a bunch of hippies.
1,PERVERT,DISGUSTING!!!! He used his position and power to take advantage of those poor kids. How fitting the title of his book relates to his current situation.
4,A treasure for any fan of football.,"His others deeds notwithstanding (and for the record, i don't approve of most of it), it must be repeated that the man absolutely revolutionized the game of football. The book really illustrates his genius in defensive schemes on the grid-iron. A must have, for any lover of the game."
5,Excellent family reading.,"Everyone is quick to pass judgement. This man is innocent until proven guilty.Let me say that I went to college at Penn State, and coach Sandusky touched quite a few young lives.The man is a legend.This is a great book to read, learn about the man, linebacker U, and the countless children that he touched along his journey to greatness.Coach Sandusky molded many fine young football players, mostly linebackers; and quite a few tight ends.He also designed a trick play that help Penn State beat Ohio State, earning him elite status among football coaches world wide. Who can forget back door trap/ fullback deep up the middle?And coach Sandusky also personally made sure all students practiced excellent hygiene.Great book to read, and thats my take on it.'Touched' will make you feel like a school boy again.Godspeed to you coach Sandusky..."
1,"Touched, my left butt cheek (or not since I'm a girl)","Jerry, I really wanted to hear all about how you gained the trust of little disadvantaged boys in PA and then used that trust to sexually molest and assault them. Where was THAT chapter? Cause, you know NAMBLA members everywhere really wanted to get some tips from you. I also want to know how you knew that everyone else knew about what you were up to and didnt hang yourself from a tree. Man, this book sucks."
1,Wow - How Much Do You Think Dick Vermeil Regrets That Writing That Foreward?,"In his own words:""This book will be a special read for anyone who respects people who are unselfish and give a little piece of themselves to everyone with whom they come in contact.""Well, I guess the part about giving a little piece of themselves to everyone with whom they come in contact seems somewhat accurate...""Enjoy, because this man, Jerry Sandusky, is an original piece of work!""Not sure it's how he meant it, but an original piece of work is one way to describe him..."
1,Dexter Morgan,"Where's Dexter when you need him?""I'm hoping Dexter Morgan will make an exception to his ""CODE"" just this one time, to giveCoach Sandusky the recognition he deserves."
2,MISLEADING,"Although the emotionally caressing story of how Jerry inched his way deep into the farts of those who believed he was their dad's friend made me sticky tear up, I cannot recommend this to anyone. I tried every technique in this book, and still no one from the local foster home will go out with me!! The only reason it gets two stars is cause I get a hawt picture of Mr. Sanlustky's beckoning stinkfist on the cover to watch over me as I slumber on my stepmom's couch."
1,Jerry is a monster,"I can't understand why the photographer who shot the cover for the book didn't include the little boy's penis, which Mr. Sandusky must've been reaching out to in the picture. Don't buy this book."
1,The irony,"Full disclosure: I have not bought this book, nor do I intend to. Nor do I suggest you buy it.I do find it interesting that a PEDOPHILE would actually PUBLISH a BOOK called TOUCHED. Narcissism knows no bounds, does it?This is the truth being stranger than fiction.Anyone know if Bernie Fine has a book on how to be a better family member?"
1,Touched More Than Lives...,"It is so disgusting that this man gained the trust of so many children, just to have him betray their trust, and the trust of their parents, with his sodomizing one (or more?) of them in the shower. Sick. And that you have Penn State thug students rioting that this child predator was caught & will be punished? What has happened the minds of our youth? Anyway, this book is a piece of junk. No thanks, regular people don't want to hear the sentimental stories of a man like THAT!"
1,Please remove this book!,"Please remove this book, especially as the writer has been charged with 40 counts of felony for the sexual assault/abuse of children. Amazon should not be promoting this book or helping to enrich Sandusky."
1,Put this on the shelf right by your John Wayne Gacy paintings,"McQueary could have immediately rescued a child. He could have helped the child escape or get him to a safe place and then immediately phone the state police.That didnt happen.McQueary is a POS and unfit to coach, teach, train, mentor or guide anyone.The PSU university bookstore is still selling this book.I say buy them all up and burn them just as was done with the Gacy prison paintings after that POS was executed.All the Athletic Dept and senior academic leaders should be shown the door out of the college and then march them right into the door of a jail!"
1,"Amazon, please get this off your site","Amazon, please remove this book from your site. It has become a total slap in the face to the victims."
1,Sandusky Has Quite A Legacy to Leave Behind...,"...but unfortunately none of that will be in this book. Here's a man who ruined the legacy of Penn State, forced Joe Paterno, a living legend and hero to the students to end his career in shame and worst of all, took advantage of the innocence of young children and scarred them for life.This biography is sure to be a one of a kind item. Literally the only one I can think of that doesn't mention what the subject will be remembered for. Imagine a Walt Disney bio that doesn't mention Mickey Mouse, or a Hitler bio that doesn't mention World War II.Of course, that doesn't mean you'd want to buy this book. Don't support pedophiles. Don't support Jerry."
1,Not fappable at all.,"I got this expecting a fantastic stroke book about all his steamy escapades with young boys, but there's not a word of it in here! What a disappointment."
1,"Look - it also comes in a ""Leather Bound"" edition -","Look - it also comes in a ""Leather Bound"" edition -Just like the children at his camp...So much for Jo Pa's integrity, I guess it wasn't convenient to be a man of principal."
1,No more touching,"""Touched: The Jerry Sandusky Story"" will fit nicely in your bookshelf along such classics as ""Knifed: The O.J. Simpson Story,"" ""Fondler: Confessions of a Pedophile,"" and ""Avoiding Blue Dresses: Sexual Harassment for the Aspiring Politician."""
1,Pulls way too many punches,"Look, confession here: I own a copy of this book. It's an okay read if you're into learning about the 3-4 defense and how to beat the Miami Hurricanes and stuff like that, but it lacks the most important detail of all: the child rapes. Why isn't there anything in here about the child rapes? I mean, he has a chapter on how great his dad was; surely the child rapes are just as important as Pappa Art Sandusky's tutelage, perhaps more so if one considers that Sandusky opened a foundation for the express purpose of child raping. So until Jerry revises this book to include more about the child rapes (perhaps he can write an epilogue on toilet paper when he's in the pokey), I'm going to have to withhold that second star."
1,Pedophile Collector's Item???,Wow! This is actually becoming a collector's item?! How incredibly sad! Anyone buying this book should be ashamed of themselves!
1,Book by Accused Pedophile and Child Rapist,This author has nothing to say of any value. Currently charged with 40 criminal counts - sexual crimes against underage children by the Pennsylvania Attorney General. He should never have been allowed around young men much less underage at risk children. Accused of using Penn State facilities to sexually assault young boys in the PSU locker room and showers.
1,Gross,"I used to clean the showers at Penn State and let me tell you, that dude would leave one heck of a mess in there. In fact, it was almost like there were little kids horsing around in there. I am disappointed that the book makes no mention of this, as Jerry used to come by and tell me how the showers at Penn State were his favorite part of the football complex. Why no shower love for me, Jerry? I used to clean up after you every single week."
1,Joe Paterno is a fraud ......,"The PSU AD and VP of finance abruptly quit and are arrested? What did Sandusky have on them that those two idiots did not call the law when it was reported? Where is the kid and how f'd up is he now, especially that this has come to light today. My dad told me that Paterno was not good and he said that a month ago, doesn't think much of him. My dad was spot on."
1,WOW,Can't belive this perv wrote this book !And what the hell is a 10 year old doing in a college shower ??
3,Jerry Sandusky:Touched,"I'll admit right off that I havn't purchased the book. When I saw it at a local bookstore before Sandusky gained such notoriety it didn't do much to tickle my fancy. I have a suggestion for a sequel, however. ""Helping boys succeed: how to come from behind in a screwed up world."""
1,Memoirs of an Accused Pedophile,"Amazon, do not sell this alleged serial pedophiles book. This guy has some nerve writing a book like this while laughing all the way to the bank."
1,Mike D,"Wonder what his second book is gonna be titled..... My first guess is, ""How to sleep on your back while in medium security prision."""
1,Remove this book NOW!!,"This is disturbing!!!! ""Touched"", what a horrific slap in the face to all the victims that his biography is titled this way. The only right thing to do for AMAZON is to remove this book from your site, ASAP, at least until the trial for his 40 counts of child abuse come to a close. And then I feel certain you will be leaving it off forever."
1,Touched by Jerry and the babies will never be okay!,"This book need to be removed immediately and everyone who made a purchase should get a full refund. How dare this man who has utilized the taxpayers of PA to help him promote child abuse continue to benefit. He needs to be killed, no more years at our expense."
4,A Bit of Wrestling History,"A fine effort by the WWE. They touch base on just about every major wrestling family there has been. My only complaint, as with most of the thier compilations, is it could be longer with a little more focus on each family.Good matches on the DVD as well."
3,OK,Not the best pro wrestling DVD but I suppose a decent account of some of the great pro wreetling families.
3,Armstrong Family and Poffo Family Snubbed?,"How can you leave off the Armstrong wrestling family. I myself work with a wrestling company in Alabama and the Armstrongs are huge in this area. How big the Von Erich family are in Texas the Armstrongs are in Alabama. I have met all 5 members of the family and can say that they should definately be included in this dvd. Vince does own some footage of them because they were all in WCW at one time and Brian (Road Dogg) was in WWE for most of the Attitude Era. I mean they could have at least put 1 Road Dogg match on there or something. Also, why isn't the Poffo family on here. Angelo Poffo was one of the best in his time and then his two sons were also great especially the Macho Man Randy Savage, and Lanny Poffo wasn't bad either. The Genius was a funny gimmick. I think both of those families should have been included."
2,Great concept but better left on the shelf.,"My 2 year old daughter got this for a present and within a month it was broken. While it worked, she loved it and was very good with it. It was often frustrating though when she would push the handle down over and over and get no bubbles. Eventually, the thing stopped working altogether. I figured the batteries had died and when I went to change them, I found that the bubble solution had leaked into the battery compartment. I initially chalked it up to my daughter and maybe I didn't see her do something to it so we bought her another one. This one was broken within a few days due to the same problems. The concept for this is great, but is not worth the money at all."
2,Cute but not much fun,This is a cute bubble machine. But honestly it isn't the most well made toy at all. The handle becomes defective and stays down. The solution leaks from the bottom and you don't get much bubbles coming out of the product.
1,Disappointed,"I got this as a gift for my 18 month old son. It only produces one lousy bubble with each pull of the handle, very sad. My son got very frustrated and so did I. I would not recommend this product."
1,Broke after 5 minutes!,This toy is awful. I only purchased it this morning at Target. It took far longer to put the batteries in and fill with the solution than it actually worked! Returning it for a refund today!
2,"very cute, easy to use, but leaked","My son is 13 months. He loves this toy, and took him about 15 minutes to figure out how to use it. The only problem was that it leaked. I noticed once my son turned the blower on its side bubble liquid was seeping out. I realized during clean up, it also had gotten into the battery compartment."
4,Great toy for all ages! And no mess created!!!!,I agree this is a great toy! The kids at my house LOVE to play with this bubble maker. They are able to make it work on their own. I have NOT had any trouble with this machine either. I am getting two more to give as gifts to some family members. This is the best way to make bubbles without any spills or the kids taking the wand and sticking it in their mouths. Especially the younger kids who don't understand how to blow or what to do with the wand. I recommend this blower to everyone.ThanksTiffany
1,Disappointing toy,"The concept of this toy is good but its performance was very disappointing. I bought this toy for a toddler preschool class and not one child could master it. Even when I used it bubbles only came out about every third or fourth push of the handle. The handle must be held down a few seconds to make bubbles come out and the kids let go too soon. Also, the children wanted to look down the hole and watch the bubbles come out and then the bubbles get in their face and eyes. I sent this toy back."
1,Disappointing,"My two year old loves bubbles, and wants to do everything herself, but is always spilling the soap. So I was excited when I saw this toy! When I bought this initially I assumed that particular one was broken and I exchanged it for another which was similarly broken. It was a disappointing birthday gift for my two year old. Upon pushing the lever there is simply a buzzing sound, no bubbles, maybe *one* bubble squeezes out after 20 tries. This is the worst toy I've ever seen. I can't believe it is still on the market!!!!"
1,Does not work,We have tried using all types of bubbles. followed all directions and it still does not blow bubbles. it is a piece of junk and not worth the money to buy it.
1,Disappointing!,"As other people said, this toy only produces a couple bubbles after pushing the handle down 3 or 4 times. I do not recommend this bubble machine."
2,Watch out for leaks...,"The biggest problem I had with this was that it leaked. It is supposed to be leak proof for the active toddler but when my 15 month old daughter tipped it a certain way, the liquid bubble soap spilled out. Also, when it sat on our coffee table overnight, a huge puddle was underneath by morning. Hard to say if my daughter would have enjoyed it long term since it only lasted one day. It may have been a bad one but it should be made better if it going to used by a toddler that may not treat it gently."
2,No patience for it,I bought this for my youngest son when he was 19 months old..he is now 23 months and still won't bother with this slow toy.
4,good toy,my daughter likes the bubbles but gets a little discouraged when they don't come out fast enough for her
2,"it was okay,just kinda boring",this movie wasn't much of a kid's movie.it had an adult plot but the funny parts were good for kids. it was ok
2,"If you like unfunny movies, this one's for you!","A group of unsuspecting characters with aliases gather in a giant mansion, only to find murder everywhere. ""Clue"" tries to be a black comedy, but it's not. Not only is it unfunny, but the acting could use a bit of work. The movie is too long and dull. And if you think you can solve the mystery, it's impossible, due to the fact they don't give you enough information. A movie any film-goer should stay away from.Starring: Eileen Brennan, Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn, Christopher Lloyd, Michael McKean, Martin Mull, Lesley Ann Warren."
2,80's Classic,"This movie has an all-star cast, including Christopher Lloyd, Tim Curry, Eileen Brennan, and Madeline Khan. But the movie is just not funny at all. The only good thing about this movie besides the cast is the 3 different surprise endings."
1,I love the movie...,I could have sworn I bought an actual copy of Clue and not instant video of it. Can I be reimbursed?
2,It was the most boringest book I have ever read.,"It was very confusing, and it wasn't fun to read. Some parts were very confusing. It was a very bad book. END"
1,"I Love Unhelpful Votes. In Fact, I Yearn For Them...","...and it's a good thing too because I know this review will get slammed with them.A good, no, make that a GREAT cast is utterly wasted (not to mentioned completely embarrassed) in this dreadful piece of movie making which, judging by all the rave reviews it is getting here, proves once again that the lowest common denominator will win out.This is little more than lowbrow slapstick in the guise of using a classic board game as a gimmick to sell it. The characters are so flat, so one dimensional, that even the superb cast members playing them (Eileen Brennan and the wonderful Madeline Kahn are the most noteworthy) can't breath much life into them and the writing of the script comes across like it was done by a computer that had every single slapstick routine programed into it. The end result is a movie utterly lacking in any sense of creativity or imagination.Dreadful and simply quite painful to watch."
4,Get a Clue,"One of the moives that was actually good in the eighties and got very little respect. Very well written, acted, and directed. One of my favorite movies, BUY THIS MOVIE! Very good fun, comedy, and a very good twist at the end of the movie."
5,Full of mystery and comedy,"I absolutely LOVED this movie. I thought it was exciting, entertaning, and fantastic. I thought that the idea of the different possibilities for the end was just great, and I could watch this movie 1,000 times, and still find new clues every time. This is one of the best comedies I have ever watched."
5,FUNNY!,"This is a great movie, with great acting and great comedy and one liners... but if you watch the movie trailer there are two scenes not in the actual movie. One where Mr.Green is screaming and Col. Musterd says ""Why are you screaming?!?!"" Green says ""Because I'm affriad..."" Musterd ""Of What?!?!?!"" Green then says ""Screaming!"" and also when Prof. Plum says ""Oh im looking"" while he looks down Yvettes top. I was wondering if anyone knows where i can watch deleted scenes from this movie or if there are any hidden easter eggs on the DVD... please email me at trasher1012002@yahoo.com.... sorry for how crappy my review is but im pressed for time!LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Lost interest after a few minutes...,"I like the board game well enough, so I thought I'd check out the movie. Mistake-didn't like it. It was just a bunch of actors bumbling around, blaming each other for ever-occurring in-house murders!Pass..."
2,A silly movie,I am not a fan of this type of movie too silly. The character development was bizzare and I did not want to finish the movie.
4,Funny Movie,"This is a very funny movie. I had seen it years ago, but saw it again recently at a friend's house. I decided to buy my own copy. It is based on the board game Clue and is a totally crazy movie, but fun to watch."
5,"I love this movie, in the living room, with the pop corn.","Great, great movie. Tons of big names, hilarious throughout. Superb film. It's a shame they don't make them like they used to."
4,"Corny, cute, and pretty accurate.","Simply put, it's a movie from 1985 trying to show a creepy old mansion from 1954 all based on a board game. It's amusing, but if you're looking for a seasonal blockbuster go somewhere else. Personally I enjoyed it, and the presence of all 3 endings rather than the single one makes it even more interesting."
5,Comedy and mystery,"Clue: The MovieFor those who have played the board game 'clue', this movie was the result of said game. It is really funny, and at the end, they give possible different ending scenes. If you get it and you enjoy comedy and trying to figure out who has committed the murder, this is the movie."
5,All-time Favorite,"This is one of my favorite movies. No matter how many times I see it, I always find it hilarious. I've seen it too many times to count. It seems like the more I watch it, the better it gets!""Let us in! Let us in! Let us out! Let us out!"""
5,Best movie EVER!,"If you have not seen this movie yet, you need to! It is so clever and funny and addicting! The script is incredible and the acting is superb. I highly recommend this as an excellent family comedy!"
4,"The movie, ""Clue""","I love this movie. It has no message, no social content, no lessons to learn. It's just pure fluff and entertainment. It's a great way to spend and hour or two to simply cheer yourself up and take a break from the day-to-day grind. I saw it years ago and hadn't thought about it until I saw it advertised at Amazon. The DVD gives the viewer the option to see all three alternate endings - very fun!"
4,Classic Silly Whodunnit,"I've enjoyed this comedy since I was 13, and I loved the three endings. It's a silly whodunnit based off a board game with an all-star cast of comedians. The movie begins with six prominent guests invited to dinner at a secluded mansion. Wadsworth, the butler, tells them they are all being blackmailed by Mr. Boddy who is threatening to expose their guilty secrets. What to do. Get rid of Mr. Boddy.Each is given a weapon, like those in the board game, the lights go out and Mr. boddy is dead. Who did it? A series of other characters turn up dead as well.What's funniest is watching the guests go from poised and polished to panicky when they realize they are trapped in the house with an unknown murderer. The vampy vixens get catty, and the stately gentlemen become bumbling comical fools. But in the end...or endings...you find out who did it, where, and with what.What really makes the movie are the memorable lines. Colleen Camp is at her sexiest playing the French maid."
3,"Witty, dry, and funny","Clue is one of those movies you just can't be serious with. It's fun!While I have yet to see the DVD version, therefore unable to comment on the actual quality of the DVD reproduction, the movie is quite wonderful. It is fun seeing the perfect sets, the eloquent actors and the bizarre and hilarious situations. The fast one-liners, zingers, and physical commedy is all at its finest here. A fun movie, but don't expect too much mystery either..."
4,Michael McKean as Mr. Green,"For those of you who don't know, Michael McKean also played Lenny Kosnowski on Laverne and Shirley. Catch him in all of his movies. Maybe he'll be a little bit more appretiated. He has been in such classic films as ""This Is Spinal Tap."" As far as the movie ""Clue"" goes, I have two opinions. 1: parts of this movie make you want to wonder why you are even laughing, and may cause you to think twice about even watching it. And 2: wonderful performances make this movie worthwhile, and the end is a good surprise. Perhapes the best scene is the end, when we find out the truth about Mr. Green (Michael McKean is, by the way, one of my favorite actors). A good investment for certain types, but don't expect a live version of the game."
5,CLUE RULZ!,"Clue is a riot from start to finish. I'm a huge fan of the film and of the merchandise! I have everything but the lobby standee and/or the video counter card of the house lighting up. If anyone out there has it, please email me!"
5,One of My All Time Favorite Comedies,"I was in junior high when this film came out. Having been a big fan of the board game, I went to the movie the week it came out. I ended up going to it several times. When the film originally aired in the theater, they randomly showed 1 of 3 different endings during each showing. This DVD has all 3 endings for your choosing. Even though the critics did not rate this film highly, I thought it was wonderful. The set was brilliant. . . exactly what you would expect out of a great murder mystery. This movie has many laugh out loud moments. Yet, despite the comedy format, it is a great mystery as well.I would definitely recommend this movie to any comedy or mystery fan."
5,A Fine Movie For The Whole Family...,"""Clue"" is a safe movie for family night with little profainity and lots of laughs. Tim Curry plays the ""buttling"" butler, Wadsworth, with a knack for solving mysteries. With an all-star cast, this board-game comedy delivers in all ways. Good clean humor takes the cake, while a little bit of wonderment is thrown in, too. Curry is supported by Eileen Brennan as Mrs. Peacock, Madeline Kahn as Mrs. White, Michael McKean as Mr. Green, Christopher Lloyd as Prof. Plum, Lesley Ann Warren as Ms. Scarlett, Martin Mull as Colonel Mustard, and Lee Ving as Mr. Boddy. And to make a long story short (Too Late!), this movie is a must-see for comedy buffs and fans of the board game!"
5,Comedy,"Great movie, even better then I remembered, now on DVD. Arrived nicely packaged. Brand new. Good quality."
3,"GREAT movie, ehhhh DVD....","We all know CLUE as the premiere cult murder-mystery/comedy of the mid-eighties, so WHY is this DVD so barren. The movie, and a few trailers wont cut it for this killer film. DONT BUY THIS ONE, lets all wait for the release (hopefully) of some kind of Special Edition."
5,Funny!,This was definitely one of the funnier movies I have seen in a while. Lots of dry and slap stick humour. And DVD was in a great condition.
5,No Mystery--This movie is great!,"It was the summer of 1993 or 1994, I was 10 or 11, when I first saw Clue and it has been one of my top 5 movies ever since.Clue is a movie that demands multiple viewings, not just to see the clues to the murder peppered in, but to catch the quick one-liners and jokes throughout.Colonel Mustard: Are you trying to make look stupid on front of the other guests.Wadsworth: You don't need any help from me, sir.Colonel Mustard: That's right.This movie contains some of Hollywood's funniest people at the time including Tim Curry, Michael McKean, amd Christopher Lloyd is absolutely hilarious as Professor Plum.If you have never seen Clue, I highly recommend you buy it and watch this movie over and over again."
5,LOVE IT!,"Clue is probably one of my very favorite movies of all time. Its some of the best timing and comic acting I have ever seen. The casting of this film is pure brilliance! Whenever I just want to pop a movie in to watch, 9 times out of 10 its going to be Clue, I never get tierd of it. Give it a try, I don't think you'll be dissapointed."
5,Clue rocks!,"I first caught this movie on TV when I was about eight years old. Months later, I was renting it every other week until I had all the dialogue memorized.I was thinking about this movie just the other day (ten years later!). I rented it with my little sister, who's seven years old and let me just say... I wasn't expecting it to still be funny but it honestly is! The both of us absolutely loved it. If anything the movie just got funnier, as I now understand a lot of the jokes that went over my head when I was younger.Brennan, Curry, McKean and Kahn steal most of the scenes... and with good reason! They're amazing! So is this movie, so watch it already!"
1,Stupid movie,"Not worth it. Not even entertaining. I threw it out, didn't even want to give it away. It is so outdated."
2,"I think the term ""good enough"" applies well here.","I see a lot of positive reviews for this movie here, so I guess I'm in the minority but I did not love this movie. I watched it on one of those nights where I had nothing to do but kill some time and it was good enough for that. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy or rent it though.The acting is good and there are definitely some funny parts, but at times I felt myself becoming more annoyed than humored. The pace of the movie seemed to bounce between manic fast and very slow. There were a few times when I got the humor and thought to myself ""Not funny, boring.""Not to generalize, but I think if you like Monte Python, you will like this. I don't like either one much. If you have an evening to waste and just want to kill time and can borrow the movie, go ahead, its not terrible. Don't go out of your way though to see it."
3,A Misstep,"For around half an hour, the straight-up cheeseball nature of this relic held its own. After that, its entire gimmick began to fall apart and the jokes started to sag badly. Despite a lights-out cast, Clue's genuine bits of humor are sporadic at best, surrounded with loads of forced puns and winks or nods at the camera. By the end, I was fighting off a heavy set of eyelids and praying for it to wrap everything up already. The idea of doing three different endings, chosen at random prior to each screening, was a brilliant concept but the execution left a lot to be desired - none of them really worked."
3,good but anyway it's only a short story,i want to say that this movie is very funny and it works. the story is full of mistery and the ending is fantastic and very strange. but we are talkin' about a film that isn't nothing but a funny detective story and so i can't say it's the top... after watching it maybe u will want to watch it another time but it's always the same ... interesting. very good
3,Not as funny as I remembered...,"I had fond memories of this movie being very funny. It did have a few moments - but in general I'd say even at the rock-bottom Amazon price it wasn't really worth buying. I should have checked the library first. Clue is the kind of movie that sounds like it was recorded to a laugh track - there are many pauses after punch lines - but there's no laugh track, so it seems a bit painful to watch all these actors standing around waiting for the built-in laughter pause to be over."
2,Clueless,"""Clue"" is '80s proof that board game movies aren't a new idea. Apparently there are plans afoot for Monopoly and Candy Land movies. Try sitting through ""Clue""... and you'll see why it works as a concept,but not on the screen.""Clue"" has Tim Curry in the role of the campy butler,a far cry from his Rocky Horror Picture Show glory. Martin Mull, Christopher Lloyd, Madeleine Kahn and Lesley Ann Warren star as the roles in the game-Col. Mustard, Mr. Peacock, Ms. Plum, and so on. They're very much stock characters, so Curry is left to improvise. ""Clue"" is set during the McCarthy era, and the Red Scare is a theme. Were the screenwriters attempting something ""daring"" during the Reagan era? Trying to make a profound statement with a campy movie... doesn't quite work.""Clue"" relies on gimmicks;namely,Curry,and its ""three alternate endings."" For a time,it's engrossing,just as a concept. Curry keeps the action going with one-liners. Still,it's boring. It's definitely a bored game!"
5,my fiancee wastes money,she ordered this and we never watched it. this is not unusual for her but it's going to have to stop here.
3,2 stars out of 4,The Bottom Line:Tim Curry is in top form but the murder mystery aspects of the movie don't work at all and the three ending gimmick is funny but also renders the solution rather arbitrary; watch Sleuth or Deathtrap before you waste your time on Clue.
2,"Not good...dated, very few laughs, not a very compelling story.","I just finished watching this with my family based on the multiple 5-star reviews. Our two star review is generous. It was not the worst movie we've ever seen, but it's in the bottom 100."
2,meaningless,"I am a mature adult, however I could not make heads or tails of what this movie was all about. I have donated it to a thrift shop."
2,Hard to follow. Too ridiculous.,"I enjoyed seeing the secret passages, but that's about it. I was disappointed. Hard to follow. Too ridiculous. I love the concept, but it could have been done better."
4,"2000 dvd vs. 2009 ""I Love the 80s"" dvd","Does anyone know the difference (if there is any) between the 2000 Clue dvd release, and the 2009 ""I Love the 80s"" Clue dvd release? Features? Remaster?It's impossible to tell from the description and reviews.The four stars is for the movie itself (hilarious!). If I knew more about the dvd, it could be five."
5,One of the Best Comedies Ever,"This is one of the greatest comedies I have ever seen. The acting skills of Madeline Khan and Mr. Curry are outstanding. I have watched this movie many, many times and am quite pleased to see it released on DVD."
5,great movie,"the dvd works fine, the quality is excellent, it came on time and is all they said itll be, good price, good product, good purchase."
4,interesting,this movie is light hearted interesting movie. its not so funny but very enjoyable.the actors have acted very nicely
5,Clue is my absoulte favorite movie ever!,My friends and I all agree that Clue is one of our all time favorite movies. It's a must see for any mystery/comedy fan! If you like to play the game clue then you'll really love this great movie!
5,Inappropriate for young children,For adults the movie is great. But for kids I promise you after 10 minutes of this movie you Dad will yell at you and tell you to turn it off. Too bad. I love the clue board game and the clue characters.I'm six
5,THE BEST MOVIE EVER,"The first time I saw this movie I was 8. Since then this has been my favorite movie. The puns, political jokes, and the amazing acting makes this movie a necessity for any movie collection. I strongly recommend CLUE. As soon as you watch it you will be hooked. My favorite line: -""You cannot make an omelet with out breaking eggs. Any cook will tell you that!"" -""But look what happened to the cook!"""
5,a play called Clue,This is one of the funniest movies ever made. I once saw it done for live theater. Does anyone know where I could find a copy of it?Marcus
3,Clue,The movie was a fun and humorous takeoff on the boardgame. Good cast and performances for a spoof type movie.
1,A lot of unnecessary (inappropriate) content,"This movie contains a lot of unnecessary sexual references, some more obvious than others. It is rated PG, but definitely is not suitable for children under 13, or even young teens. I bought it to show to a group of 12-15 year olds, but definitely will not show it to that age group again."
1,wasted my money,"I have no idea how this movie can be rated so high here at Amazon.I bought this movie because of these rave reviews here, but I am upset that I bought it and wasted my 10 dollars. What a shame !!The movie starts out fine. Cast includes some famous actors and actresses with big breasts. Before some narrative can be constructed, the movie blurts out all the details about the murders, and it ends. I was totally unprepared for such an abrupt and strange ending, and it left some sour taste in my mouth. I felt like I was conned.Don't buy this DVD even if you are a big fan of the board game 'Clue'."
1,Don't have a Clue why people love this movie,"I was really looking forward to watching this movie because I love the Clue books and game, but I was really disappointed. Why? Because Mr. Boddy was evil,the charactors were one dimensional, and the jokes were stupid.You could hardly tell Mr. Green from Professor Plum.NONE of the charactors wore their own color,so you kept forgeting who was who.Mrs. ""White"" was wearing BLACK! Even her hair was jet black! While the multiple endings were intriguing, none of them were very good.As far as I'm concerned, only one thing was funny,and it wasn't very funny."
1,Pedestrian,"Weak attempt at turning the classic board game into a big screen movie. The characters are better defined in the game than they are in the movie which, despite some great talent among the cast, has about the same point as trying to play the game with two people, and about as much fun too.Avoid at all costs."
1,Clueless,"Easy to see why this was so unpopular. Incredibly lame and boring. I guess that's what you get when you turn a silly board game into a movie. Again, I don't know why one star is the minimum rating--suggests that the product has some merit. This has none."
1,this is the most confusing book i have ever seen,it has part that are very confusing. the part that i'm in is so dumb i don't like the book. their is a part that is saying that a girl how is deid and takl back to thewm in the died END
3,Funny 80s classic,Great movie...brings back memories from my childhood. I wish there were more movies like this. I highly recommend this movie.
2,ok for a lazy day,It was entertaining to watch on a lazy sunday afternoon. My son enjoyed it more so it was fun to watch with him
5,Great Movie! Everyone should see!,I was on vacation in California and I had never seen the movie before. Well the Nuart center they were performing the movie live. I must say it was wonderful! Colleen Camp was there. It was so amazing I can't even explain it! If you haven't seen the movie you HAVE to see it!
5,Great movie,"Love this movie and it is only being played on one channel on cable that had questionable commercials. Now we can watch our favorite movie without having to answer odd questions from our boys. Arrived in good quality, movie plays great. This was our first used product from Amazon and would do it again."
4,Nice Movie,"Very nicely made... The comedy, acting and the plot was very good. Best part was the ending and Director's imagination."
4,Soon to be a classic ! (if it ISN'T one already)...........,"FINALLY ! A DVD WIDESCREEN version of one of the wackiest, screwball comedies of all time ! This one has it all - Slapstick, wit, charm, mystery...You can't go wrong with some of the funniest comedic actors on film: Martin Mull, Chrstopher Lloyd, Madeline Kahn (R.I.P), Mike McKean...Their delivery is on target and the writing is SURPRIZINGLY good !But the REAL gem of the film is watching Tim Curry do his 'butler thing'....A PERFECT role for him, and very, very, funny !Although a bit thin on plot, it well makes up for it with snappy one-liners and a wonderful, likeable cast. From the sex-crazed Prof Plum to the wonderfully buxomed french maid (played WELL by Colleen Camp), this is a comedy to treasure...Just kick back...relax...forget about the world around you...and enjoy !P.S. A SHARP dvd transfer !"
2,Very funny but...,"Let me preface this by saying that I have always loved this movie in the VHS format. I have owned two copies because, basically I wore out the first one. The top notch comedic performances of Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn, Martin Mull, et. al. never fail to get me laughing and to make a long story short (too late!) I couldn't wait for the movie to reach this format (DVD). My expectations may have been a little too high though. I really never expected the sound to be SATNDARD MONO. I have a top of the line in-home theater system and to hear all the sound come from the front center cube was no small shock, it wouldn't even simulate surround sound well. The picture is crisp with only slight artifacts to be noted. The bonus material...hello... what bonus material! The theatrical preview hardly counts as bonus material. I love the movie but the creators of this disk should re-think what the consumers (like me) expect after waiting so long for this movie to reach this format."
5,CLUE,"This movie, Clue, is a great movie for those who enjoy the unexpected, and for those of us who enjoy to let lose and enjoy the silly but very humoreous side of our personality. A+"
4,"Funny ""who done it""? with several twists","If you like the boardgame, this is a must. The characters, are truly ""characters"" and they'll make you snicker countless times. It's a classic ""who done it"" fun ride until the end. It has a classic ""theater"" feel, and the characters are what old ""Sherlock Holmes"" type films are made of. Neat film with cool performences!"
5,All time classic movie!,"This is the best movie ever made! Honestly I have seen this movie over 200 times, and know ever-single word in it, and yes I do have a life! :) Ever time I watch it I catch something new, or see a ""clue"" that I missed before. Great storyline, awesome cast, an all around wonderful movie in which all ages will enjoy."
5,citizen who?-clue is the best EVER,i have seen this movie over 60 times and it gets better every time
5,"""Frankly Scarlett, I don't give a damn.""","I have to say that clue is my favorite movie. Not only does Tim Curry, once again, play a great bad guy but the rest of the cast is excelent. I love the fact that the movie had three endings and that when it was in theaters they were all shown at different theaters. Clue is by far the best movie i have ever seen! END"
5,Clue The Movie,Great transaction. Came quickly. Great quality!LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!! It's a classic! We laughed just like we did the first time we saw it.
5,"i'm not shouting! all right, i'm shouting.i'm shouting i'm","shouting that this movie is comic perfection. it's hard for me to top the ecstatic reviews that preceed mine. what i can say is that this movie has been my giddy treat, my zany, campy, delicious favorite. i'm a fan of all cinema, but when i'm feeling like a witty, sublimly amusing farce, i watch this. i am obsessed, and you should be too. it's just that funny!"
4,Clue,"I liked this movie when I was a kid. Little did I know that the different endings were each played at a different theater, so no one could say they saw the same thing. lol"
2,Disapointing book about a great topic,This book is a valiant attempt to cover an interesting topic but in the end it just comes up short. It is very badly written and the prose is so academic that it does not even hold a candle to other books on the subject. (see any of Peter Hopkirk books). The book goes into voluminous detail that the only advantage is you get it in one book instead of five smaller ones. Overall though I would recommend you go with the five smaller ones which give you more detail and a better written story. Meyer just could not pull it off on this one which is unfortunate for such an interesting topic.
2,Tournament of Shadows,"Because I'm a Great Game fan I was quite disappointed with the book. Too many names, too much useless stuff, too much gossip and too negative about Swen Hedin. I appreciate his research but he didn't stay focused on the Great Game, he was all over the place."
2,Not as good as Hopkirk or Keay,"This book is not more than adequate: it is a reasonably exhaustive collection of events and character portraits from the Great Game over the last couple of centuries, but it does little analysis and is drily written.Much of the same history (at least pre-World War II) has been addressed by Peter Hopkirk and John Keay, and those two writers have much more ability to bring the subject to life. This volume is not entirely redundant to their works, but would really only be of interest to someone greatly interested in Central Asia and requiring the complete works on the topic."
1,Tournament of Shadows: The Great Game and the Race for Empir,I was extremely disappointed in this book. My initial expectations were that this book would provide me with a sound footing for understanding the current geo-political issues that exist in Central Asia. Instead what I found was a reference book. A book so wound up in minutia that the authors truly missed the forest for the trees! My suggestion for anyone interested in reading this book is that they first have a very deep background in this field and that their expectations from this book should be confined to simply filling in the details!
4,Very enjoyable....,"Kabul, Lhasa, the Punjab, Kashmir, Kashgar, the Taklamakan Desert - these and many other distant and mysterious places populate this story of Britain and Russia's quest for empire in Central Asia. Retelling the feats and endeavors of soldiers, explorers, archaeologists and more, Tournament of Shadows does an excellent job reeling the reader in and keeping him or her entertained.Coined the ""Great Game"", this struggle for empire, in which Britain sought to protect the Raj from an ever-expanding Russia, created a race to reach Tibet and become it's ardent suitor and protector. Harrowing tales of survival, grit and determination are placed throughout the work as an excellent complement to the wider scope of geopolitical machination.Tournament of Shadows is a fine, competent work that deserves the attention of anyone interested in Central Asia and the 19th and 20th century foreign policy conducted to consume it."
2,A book on geographic exploration with no maps ?,"While Tournament of Shadows alternates between chronological accounts central Asian exploration and mini-biographies of the explorers, the book always revolves around the Great Game, or quest for central asia. This makes it all the more surprising that there are only a few, sparsely annotated maps throughout. The text frequently references cities or geographic features that are NOWHERE to be found on any of the maps, a particular source of frustration and (I think) an indication of very sloppy preparation. The front- and end-matter maps (which are identical, unfortunately) are blury and bleed into the spine, rendering certain important locations unreadable. The text itself is an enjoyable read but light-weight analytically (more of an extended time-line than a serious analysis), and the lack of maps is extremely disappointing."
4,a must read,"if you want to get a little background about the central asia (afghanistan, pakistan, india etc) read this book. the authors let you draw your own lessons for the current era. but please look for the march 2006 reissue. the introduction and prologue update the 1999 version and add some context for your consideration of the roots of the current middle east crisis"
5,Sweet and Pretty with Meanings,"The pink hibiscus is slightly more pastel in color, more a light pink in reality. The picture shows a slightly darker pink color.This mouse pad adds a nice feminine touch to your office and it reminds you of things that are important in life - like the search for beauty.If you enjoy flower meanings, the hibiscus means consumed by love or delicate/rare beauty.~The Rebecca Review"
3,Not as good as Duck in the Truck,"It's okay, the story is fine. But compared to Duck in the Truck this one is just okay."
4,The Duck Wreaks Havoc Again,"After leaving his friends stuck in the muck, Duck is living in the same rural area as Sheep, Frog and Goat. Unfortunately for them, Duck now fancies himself a handyman. However, his absent-minded ways make him more of a menace than a helper. In fact, his ""Fix-It"" skills are less than even any shade tree mechanic. Like with the first book, Alborough manages to surprise with a clever twist, that on second reading his foreshadowed throughout the book. Once again the clever story line is complemented extremely well by the outstanding illustrations."
2,Repeating pages,There are two earlier pages that repeat later on thereby robbing us of two pages (an ruining the rhyme).I just saw that another person had a problem with pages being out of order. Must be a problem with the publisher.
3,beautiful and tempting pictures for a pastry lover and baker but.....,"for an experienced baker, this book might work, but before attempting any of the recipes, one must use a magnifying glass for the type used in the recipe to verify measurements! why did the editor/publisher decrease the type size/font style for the most important part of the recipe? Don't take for granted that the author/editor tested the recipes before making -- do your own pre-analysis based on your own experience of ratios/quantities, processes and adjust before embarking. Still, a beautiful book with some interesting narrative.A lover of pastry."
1,Too difficult to read,This might be an okay cookbook but the font is so hard to read that I don't find it worth the time when there are other cookbooks out there that are not hard to read. I hope this printer of this book reads this.
1,French Baking,"Beautiful book, enticing photos and the recipes, when they work, are excellent. This is not a book for beginning bakers, though. It requires some experience with home baking and patience because some of the quantities given are not exact and need a bit of adjusting and the essembly procedures need improvisation as well. Because many of the recipes are so involved, it takes some dexterity to reach the desired look and taste of the pastries. But when it works it is superb. I enjoyed the challenges, but buyers should beware."
5,OUTSTANDING!,"I've tried numerous receipes from this book, and with very few exceptions, they turned out just great. I've also visited the bakeries in Paris and tried the products and mine taste just as good, if not better."
3,Subjective at its Core,"Ruth Montgomery is a pioneer. To me is the female version of Edgar Cayce. Ruth is a Christian and incorporates spirituality into many traditional tenets of Christianity. So for those who were brought up in the Roman-Catholic/Christian religion, and you find comfort in that, Ruth is the spiritual writer for you. Her books are usually very well written and very informative. Threshold is no exception. And yet, I gave the book only 3 stars. How come? Well I myself am still very divided over the subject of ""walk-ins."" Supposedly a ""walk-in"" occurs when a spirit exits its body and makes a pact with another spirit to enter and thus live their life...So the 'body' never really fully understands the change that happens, but it usually ""feels different"". I do not buy into that definition of walk-in that Ruth subscribes to. So the book definately left me with a ""I dont think so Ruthie"" opinion. However, its always up to each individual to make up their own minds."
4,"I like this book, but tend to use another more often.","I'm one who likes medical texts, and I actually try to read most of what I buy. This is a excellent text. I think the organization is good, but that there is definitely room for improvement. The pictures are good, and the text is excellent, but could be slightly more concise. For these reasons, in addition to the very large size of the book, whenever there is something I need to look up, I generally reach for the Kanski textbook first as I find the pictures are just as good, the text slightly more concise but just as informative, and it is definitely easier on my back. I would recommend this book, but would look at Kanski too before you make your decision."
5,"Yes, get it for Optometry!","This is an excellent review of most ocular diseases. It is NOT too much for Optometry. Those kind of reviews are what allows other health care professionals to belittle our profession. We must know and treat all ocular diseases as Optometric physicians and this book provides great information and pictures. Of course, more pictures are always better and Yanoff and Duker have only chosen to display pictures of typical presentations of conditions. However, this book provides a good basis of important information."
4,"Easy install, but be careful!","These Perrycraft/Dynacraft roof rails were moderately easy to install on my 1999 Toyota Rav4, and look great.The catch, you must be very careful during install. It's easy to overtighten the mouting screws and strip out a pre-drilled hole in your vehicle's roof.Also, be very careful while re-curving the rails to match your roof's profile. It's not easy to do the way the instructions reccomend. I ended up with a broken tooth and scuffed knee from trying to follow the instructions."
1,Turns yellow within a week.,"I bought this cover hoping it would protect my grill from the elements. Unfortunately after just three days of exposure to the sun during the summer, the entire cover turned a mildewy yellow shade. So far at least it hasn't fallen apart, but I doubt it will last a year. And it looks extremely unsightly covering the grill on my deck. If your grill isn't exposed to direct sunlight you may have better luck, but I would probably look elsewhere."
1,one year lifespan,"Bought this as soon as I got my grill, and it barely lasted the first year. It rips easily, and I have several tears in it already. Not only that, it discolors easily as it sits outdoors. Mine is spotty and disgusting looking now, definitley won't replace it with the same model cover. As another reviewer said, it dried out and cracked pretty quickly, too."
1,Doesn't Hold Up,"I purchased this grill cover when I got my new grill. The packaging indicates a heavy duty cover, but it is definitely not. After one year the cover became hard and began cracking. I leave my grill outside year round, so exposure to the hot summer and cold winter was too much for it. Don't get this cover if you want to leave your grill outside year round."
4,Just what the cyclist ordered,Having recently started seriously doing my own work on my bicycle I find these books excellent. I already have the Haynes Bicycle manual which was a useful book to start with but I was looking for one that explained more than just how to make basic adjustments or simple component installations. I particularly like the detailed explanation in each chapter of how the various components on a bike work and the consequences of correct/incorrect adjustment or installation. The range of component types/brands covered in the books is also impressive. The books lean towards the text side of things (hence the 4 volumes) with many well drawn and clear diagrams which may not suit some people.
4,Correction,"The review below is mistaken this isn't an old anime. The movie really was made in 1997. Tezuka's story certainly does pre-date Lion King, of course."
2,Great Idea. Poor Execution.,"I don't like how the product flops back and forth... feels dangerous because it's harder to control. Since my purchase, I found another manufacturer's version and I prefer it hands down. Try to borrow someone's before you buy!"
4,Frustrated,There was no indication they bike trailer would NOT fit many bikes. We will either need to modify the trailer hitch or get a different bike.The trailer is nice -- just DOESN'T fit!
4,Love it!,"The only problem we had was that we needed the part that actually attached the pathfinder to my bike and we didn't realize that when we initially ordered, so we had to order that separately. Other than that, my daughter and I love this bike. We have been able to ride in places that would have normally been a little too busy traffic wise for my daughter who was still learning to ride herself."
3,tilted but fun,We are very happy with the trailer but I have noticed that it is somewhat tilted and I am not sure if it is an error in its design. It was not as easy to use as I thought because the child can really make you feel unstable if he or she moves too much. I am not heavy so I think that is partially why when my child moves it has a larger effect on my balance than when my husband is riding.
2,Good design badly executed,"I bought the trailer to take my granddaughter with me when I rode on vacation When I assembled the trailer, the chain was twisted. I bought a chain tool to break the chain and straighten it.Then the chain kept falling off the front chainwheel. The sprocket was badly bent. I bought a large screwdriver to straighten the chainwheel. By the time I got it all working, my vacation was over.By the time I see my granddaughter again, she'll have her own bike. I'm going to try to find someone with a small child to give the trailer to."
2,"the position of the child wasn't straight, it was almost tip over","I rated 2 stars because the joint from the kid's bike to the parent bike was too lose and the child was almost falling off from the bike. I also contact the company who made this product and they told me that they will send another part that will make the child's bike straight, but I never recived the part. I am very disappointment about because the safety of my kid is first and they didn't help me. I hope that in some future purchase the company can assist me on my needs.Thank you"
3,bike trailer,"I find this trailer to be sturdy in strength, but somewhat wobbly in its performance. Sometimes my son feels unstableand becomes a bit fearful."
2,To much info,Not a book for beginners. I am a new sailor and wanted a book to help me read charts. Perhaps a good referance book for experienced chart readers who already know how to read charts. I wasted my money and am now looking for a book on how to read charts.
4,Sooo much to learn!,"This book should be subtitled ""More than you ever thought there was to learn about navigating with the benefit of nautical charts."" Very well done, but there's a dearth of text--it's mostly page after page of all the possible symbols one might ever see on a nautical chart. It is an exhaustive work on the subject!"
3,Nice but it falls a lot.,It falls a lot from my ear. The holder does not help either because is too soft.
3,Decent quality for the price,"This headset works well and has decent sound quality, as long as you don't go too far from your phone. I was spoiled with my old one that would let me walk a good distance away from the phone and it would still work just fine (I could typically walk all over the house). This one gets static if you move more than 3-5 feet away from it. Other than that, it's a good buy, and stays in the ear well - I love that it doesn't have to go over the ear and get in the way of glasses/sunglasses."
3,won't stay in my ear,"It's small, convenient, works great, sound is great, but I thought when I read about the ""hook"" that there actually was a piece that hooked over my ear to keep it in. There is not. What the hook is is a small loop on the rubber part that goes in the ear, I suppose to give a little more substance to keep it in there. I can drive with it in if I don't move my head around a lot. But it always feels as if it's about to fall out."
4,Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth Headset,"I like the Samsung WEP200 headset. It's small and light yet solid and durable. It's an in-ear model, which I like a lot better than over-ear. And it doesn't require an earlobe hook, which I find cumbersome and uncomfortable. It has a small charging station box that doubles as a carrying case; it's light and only a little bigger than a matchbox, making it easy to carry in your pocket. I have had headsets with better sound, but they were much bigger and much more expensive.Pros: Small, light, durable, in-ear, no ear hook, inexpensive, carrying caseCons: Sound quality is average."
4,Good Bluetooth Headset,"This is the first bluetooth headset that I have ever bought. Overall, I am happy with the device, especially the compact size. I have been a little disappointed with the voice recognition. At least 50% of the time, it can't understand what I am saying so I have to manually find the number. Part of the problem may also be with my cell phone provider, Sprint. Either way, if you want a small bluetooth, then this is a great choice."
3,Works OK (not excellent) with Palm 700p,"I bought this item for use with my Verizon Palm 700p. It works ok for the most part except that I think it causes 700p to crash and reboot periodically. Also, it randomly loses connection to the 700p for no apparent reason, i.e., it is still way within range of the 700p and still loses connection. I suspect this may have something to do with 700p bluetooth firmware which I hear is quite buggy anyway. Also, it can be hard to hear in noisy conditions like in a car, or windy outdoors. However, it fits well in my ear and is comfortable."
3,"Works great, if you can keep it in your ear","The Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth Headset is light, has excellent battery life, talk time, and plenty of range. It would rate a full 5 stars if every time I used it I didn't have to think to myself ""I wonder how long it's going to be before it falls out my ear."""
5,great product and incredibly fast shipping!,"I ordered this bluetooth headset because my boyfriend has it, loves it, and highly recommends it. It's incredibly small and fits in my ear very comfortably. It's so light that it doesn't even feel like I'm wearing anything. I know that this is a complaint for some, but for me, it's a definite plus. I love the charger case that it comes in because I double it as a travel case so that it doesn't get knocked around in my purse when I take in on the go."
2,headset,"I am having a hard time getting it in my ear. Unfortunately, there are no instructions either with the headset, or anywhere on the web, that I can find as to the proper way to put it in one's ear. So far, I haven't been able to use it. I bought this because of all of the wonderful reviews I read on Amazon, but I am not happy and may have to return it."
3,The Taming of Red Butte Western,"The only part of this as being a ""Western"" story is the fact that it is a story about a railroad out West that is rampant with corruption, murder, train wrecks and all sorts of skullduggery. When a steam engine is stolen and no one knows anything about it, and it can't be found??? On a one track railroad that runs East & West??? That's when things start to become interesting.I am a fan of Wild West novels which is what I thought this was. My only disappointment was that this was not a ""shoot em up"" cowboy story. However, it was a good diversion and the ending was as wild as they get"
4,The Taming of Red Butte Western,An interesting story with built in frustrations. It kept me wondering what could go wrong next. A good plot and a good story.
4,The Taming of Red Butte,"very entertaining for people who like old westerns. includes trains, dames but no horses ti speak of which was ok"
2,Tame is More Than a Name,Read it! Worked hard to finish it. It would likely be a great novel for someone that has never read Stan Lynde or Elmer Kelton.
4,How the western towns were settled,Good story although somewhat predictable. Really puts one in the mood to want to go back to those days and help rid the small towns of the outlaws.
5,Expecting! by Susan Mallery,Expecting! was great. Susan Mallery has the ability to keep it interesting so that you do not want to put it down. Always love a happy ending.
3,Comfy but develop holes quickly!,"I've had to throw out many of these socks because they develop holes VERY quickly, but they sure are comfortable."
3,"Disappointed, but okay","My husband has lost a lot of weight due to cancer. His legs are not large. These socks still leave a indentation on his legs. They are also very short. I put them on him, and scrunch them down to the smallest part of his leg. I only use them because they are non-skid. Otherwise, I would give them away. I expected much more for the price. would not recommend."
3,Nice but small for any woman's size over 7,Met my expectation but small for foot size over 7M. Otherwise quality product. Good traction and elasticity.Good price for quality
1,Not durable,Socks are very fluffy and slippery. Shiny plastic treads are suspect and look like they would peel off quickly. Returned them all.
2,"Warm, but the skid resistant treads come off","I wore these straight out of the package. During a day of walking across my hardwood floors and area rugs, some of the skid resistant treads came off."
3,Wife Wasn't Happy,Bought these based on reviews for my wife. She just didn't like the feel of them or the fit. After many washings she still didn't like them tho they have held up well.
3,great buy for the money,"Think the socks given in the hospital have a better bottom, but these keep your feet warm. My husband and I both wear them."
5,Great Gift,Purchased them for a realtive in order to prevent slipping on non textured floors (varnished hard wood). Glad to find on online store.
5,Peace?? Pleeeeeeezzzzzze!!,"Watch this film and open your eyes America! We are so nice and the first to overlook offenses and THIS ""niceness"" of us will mean our end. What should we do? Take back America!! Stop giving it away. We can still be a generous and nice people, just not stupid. They have their own countries and look how they live and treat each other! Muslims think NOTHNG of killing another Muslim, killing us to them is an award for them. OPEN YOUR EYES!"
5,Watch it and Share it,"Gripping, Powerful, Dead on! This film expresses why ""Radical Muslims"" hate Christians (a.k.a. infidels). The Koran specifically tells them, that it is the divine will of ""Allah"" to kill non-believers. Islamic Radicals hate and kill Jews and Christians, not because they desire to do evil, but they whole heartedly believe that it is the will of there God (Allah) to do so. Not for kids. Highly recommend."
5,A Frightening but Timely Analysis,This is an excellent film about the real terrorists and their attitude toward life and death. Everyone should watch it.
1,All These 1 Star Reviews FAIL!,"They go on and on about how they are indignant and offended mightily by the content of the film, but there is little substantive rebuttal of the events portrayed in the film. WHY? You cannot deny it when enormous mobs of people are listening to a guy scream about the glory of violence to the west and that same mob then raises their hands and shouts in agreement."
3,"Good information, but very biased","The information presented is revealing and accurate to a point. The events and indoctrination are factual. The context the information is presented within is sometimes arbitrary, if not blatantly political. A free abreviated version has been mass mailed to the public (17 minutes shorter than the full length film). One has to wonder what mailing list was utilized for this? I think this information should be viewed with the understanding that there is a concerted effort by a segment of the muslim faith that wish to destroy anything secular and non-muslim. One would be foolish to believe that there are not parallel segments in every population wishing to further their own positions at the expense of others."
1,Propaganda Not Documentary,Please don't buy this piece of trash/propaganda masquerading as a documentary. I won't go into details as most of the one-star reviews offer articulate descriptions of the item and its distortions.
2,Pure Propaganda,"This is a movie that inappropriately plays on people's fears and does not tell the whole truth. It's as biased as Roger Moore's films. The sad part about this is that it will probably increase the American stereotype that all Muslims are terrorists, which is far, far from the truth. PLEASE do some research on Islam and the people of the middle east before and after seeing this film to get the full story."
1,"This is not a movie, it is Propaganda & Lies","""Obsession"" begins with a brief disclaimer that states: ""It is important to remember that most Muslims are peaceful and do not support terror."" However, the rest of the film distorts facts and events in an attempt to convince its audience of the exact opposite.It is obvious that the film's ultimate goal is to lay the grounds for a larger religious war that goes beyond our national security interests and has only two beneficiaries: radical evangelicals who hold an apocalyptic worldview, and war profiteers who gamble at the expense of thousands of American lives and trillions of tax-payer dollars.Do not waste your money or time on this movie. It is not fair, balanced or without bias. Interesting that thousands of these are being mailed FREE and without request to households the weekend before the election.[...]"
1,More Agenda than Michael Moore,"Don't waste your money or time on this ridiculous piece of propoganda. This movie is being sent out to thousands of Americans under the guise of an informative, unbiased look at radical Islam. The reality is (as the timing of these mailings should indicate) that this film is a disgusting attempt at frightening Americans into voting for Mccain.Don't believe it."
1,Propaganda Galore,Really blatant that it is circulated around the election.Extremists are in every organization and religion but this movie didn't show where the line is drawn.Just hope no one actually gets fooled by it.
2,It made me think of a prayer..,"It made me think of a prayer I once saw on a bumper sticker:""Please God, protect me from your followers.""Covers it from all sides, eh?jwrit"
1,Thank God... an antidote to thought at last!,"If you have a hankering for a good old fashioned mindless propaganda screed, this is the disc for you. It's already been thoroughly ridiculed for its ham-fisted scare tactics and factual inaccuracies. The intellectual bankruptcy of the dead-end, less-than-a-third of Americans who still swallow the neo-con con is on full display. It would be funny if it didn't turn your stomach. So when even Fox News isn't enough to suppress what remains of your analytical mind from honestly assessing the countless crimes of the current administration (which of course dwarf your pet/petty/invented crimes of the previous one), this deeply cynical, exploitative product should scare it back into submission, right quick."
5,Every American should see this!,"This video explains the war we are in, the enemy we face and why failure is not an option.Leigh"
2,Overpriced,"I was expecting alot more book for my buck. The info in the book is accurate and appropriate enough, but $45 is not an appropriate price. If you require a history of the breed and plan to show your Cavalier, then I guess you have to part with the cash. But for the casual owner/lover of these pups, much of the info was wasted."
2,It was different than pictured...,"I've been to the AZ site pictured on the cover. Sadly, the book is correct, the picture --- well, not."
3,Basic control at low price,It is what it is...a basic DMX control....no frills....one wonders why it had to be so large considering its limited functionality.
1,fell apart after 9months,This was very hard to set up in fact i never did get the emergency call to work right then the hand set stopped working and the push buttons became sticky speaker quality was poor.
5,A PERFECT GIFT FOR A NEW GRANDMOTHER,"THE AUTHOR HAS COMPLIED STORIES AND POIGNANT THOUGHTS INTO WAYS THAT WILL MAKE YOU SMILE AND TEAR UP AT THE SWEETNESS OF IT ALL. I THINK EVERYONE WILL SEE THEMSELVES OR SOMEONE THEY LOVE OR LOVED IN HERE. SHE TOUCHES ON THE CHANGING ROLES OF TODAYS GRANDMOTHERS AND THE GRANDMAS OF THE PAST THAT SHAPED OUR LIVES AND MADE US LOVE THEM SO MUCH. IF YOU KNOW A NEW GRANDMOTHER, SEND HER THIS BOOK. SHE WILL LOVE IT. IF YOU ARE A GRANDMOTHER AND YOU NEVER HEARD OF THIS BOOK BEFORE, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY IT. THIS BOOK IS A LITTLE TREASURE TO ALL WHO RECEIVE IT. BY THE WAY, I HAPPENED ON THIS BOOK AFTER MY MOTHER PASSED AWAY. SHE HAD PICKED IT UP FOR ME YEARS AGO AND FORGOT DUE TO DISTANCE AND FAILING MEMORY TO SEND IT ALONG. I FOUND IT AMONGST HER HUNDREDS OF BOOKS WITH MY NAME ON IT. A TREASURE FROM THE PAST WITH HER HANDWRITING INSIDE. YOU SEE, I BECAME A GRANDMOTHER AT 40. OH, THE SWEETNESS OF IT ALL...."
4,hysterical,"Bought this for my mother, and decided to read it after her.Very well written, and mom was very pleased as well."
2,Not that good.,"This book was just not very cute or funny. I gave it to my mom, a grandmother to be for the first time, and we read it together on the beach for a while. We were just kind of bored. I wouldn't recommend this book. I'm surprised it got such good reviews."
4,Great Book for a Grandmother Shower!,"I bought this book for a good friend who was becoming a grandmother for the first time. Friends from work gave her a Grandmother's Shower and since she is a librarian, I bought this book for her. I cannot tell you how many times she has thanked me for the book saying it made her laugh and that she was finding the stories to be very true. Two thumbs up and a snap!"
1,"Funny, You Don't Look Like a Grandmother",I did not find enough humor within the content of this book that truly related to young and contemporary grandmothers. The author could have included more interesting and humorous situations. I had been looking for a good laugh... But...never really found it.
5,"Funny, You Don't Look Like A Grandmother","This poignant, funny collection of almost every grandmother I know or knew helps the new and not so new grandmothers see themselves in many situations. I have bought copies for friends because I enjoy Lois Wyse's wit and wisdom on not only being a grandmother, but also how to deal with other grandmothers."
5,Holly Darkness,What is it you receive from a book? Could the paper produce a hand or any form in flesh? How involved do you get in spirituality when you read a text that's produced by a Saint (like St. Juan de la Cruz).Poems that reproduce the feeling of how it was when the flesh was created by naming.
3,A Tropical Mystery,"`It Happened In South Beach' by Jennie Klassel is a mystery with a splash of romance. Tilly goes to Florida to settle her eccentric aunt's estate only to find that she was murdered. Tilly becomes a `person of interest' with tall dark and handsome Special Agent Will Maitland of Interpol. Her aunt owned an antique sex shop, which adds so some interesting storylines. The author has Tilly talking to her alter egos and bizarre erotic dreams, which is an interesting idea but it was not effective. This was not my favorite book of the year but I think this author has potential."
3,"It was ok, but not what I expected.","The story itself was ok. It turned out to be a little more mystery than romance. I did a search of erotic romance and this book came up. Since I was going to read it on the beach I thought it sounded good. But where was the erotic part? The only thing erotic was the fact that her aunt, then she owned a sex shop."
4,A Hoot!,"IT HAPPENED IN SOUTH BEACH truly is a hoot. It's a pleasure to read an unknown paperback--picked up in a supermarket, as opposed to an ""important"" novel purchased in a bookstore--that is better written and more cleverly plotted than many bigger and more eagerly anticipated books.Author Jennie Klassel has written a an intricate mystery, with a detailed and complicated plot. Most importantly, she is a humorous author, giving her characters funny dialogue and hilarious situations with which to cope.This book is not for the faint-hearted, however. It is hot and sexy and explicit as to language, and much of the story is set in a shop that sells sex toys.This fictional shop purportedly is in the super-trendy ""South Beach"" section of Miami Beach. I have logged many hours in South Beach myself, and I can say that Klassel offers a wonderful sense of place about this special community.Jennie Klassel is an author to be watched."
4,Great look into old Staten Island Cosa Nostra.,"I grew up hearing most of the stories in this book and was glad she changed or omitted names. My father was very close to Tommy Ernst and they were considered ""partners"". Terri was also friends with my father and I can say that for the most part the stories are true. This is a good book and it brought back the stories my father told me about working for Pope Dee and that life on SI. I think it would be pretty interesting to bring terri onto the show Mob Wives as a representation of old SI in that life. Theresa, where ever you are I'd like to say thank you for writing this book."
1,Save your money and buy something better.,"Why are there no liner notes to this CD, you ask, that would list the artist(s) involved in this project? The mystery is solved as you listen to the songs. It is to protect the guilty - guilty, that is, of putting out bad music. That's a shame, too, because the arrangements on several of these songs are really good. Put them together with some quality vocals, and this album would be a great success. If you're interested in Bee Gees tribute albums, your money would be better spent on CD's like We Love The Bee Gees and Gotta Get A Message To You."
5,The Good Soldier-Documentary by Lexy Lovell and Michael Uys,"This is a must see for any and all that have ever thought of, participated in or have proclaimed to know what war is. This is a beautiful, sensitive documentary that forces the viewer to take a complete look at war and its consequences.The Good Soldier - Maysles Brothers Award Winning Documentary by Lexy Lovell + Michael Uys"
4,"Good, But Not The Whole Story","Over the last several years, I've been struggling to formulate just what exactly is so unsavory about the military (in the U.S., because that's the only experience I have). The obvious answer is explored in this movie: war is ugly. There is more to this film; just watch it and you will see. While this movie resonates to some degree with me, I feel like the movie is missing something. I'm not going to analyze the issue here in this post. I'll keep mulling this one over for probably a few more years. This was a good movie, but I don't know if it would be an effective message for late teens to early twenties males; the message conveyed here is too easy to be discounted as ""just a bunch of cowards,"" despite their obvious sincerity. Despite this, I believe an effective message does exist, and I'll keep searching for it. To the creators of this film, thank you for this documentary."
3,Doesn't Blow your Socks Off...,"The description includes statements describing products ability to create fog using only water and includes a Blue LED light - I certainly cannot argue with either of these statements - the problem is the amount of fog produced and the intensity of the light. Bottom line, have to be pretty close in order to realize either function is actually accuring,"
5,Works as advertised!!!,"I seldom write reviews, but have used two of these little foggers in a greenhouse for six months almost 24/7 and they work great to add humidity! I have them floating in large plastic trash cans filled with water (and a tablespoon of disinfectant), controlled by standard plug-in light timers. I didn't expect much for this price, but they just keep chugging on...and on....and on. I'm buying another as back-up -- just in case. My orchids love the moisture and it sure beats pricey greenhouse humidifiers that don't have nearly the capacity. The blue light is a little weird at night, but the plants don't seem to mind. The whole local orchid club is interested now."
3,worked great the first week then stopped,I have a grey sediment on the ultrasound head after one week. I used distilled water so I don't see it as something in the water. I tried cleaning it to no avail. I then tried soaking it in a product for cleaning minerals off metal and it didn't work. Now I'll see how customer care responds.
3,Works but Doesn't Work,"Reading the title ...""for ponds and water gardening"" I was excited to try this out. I have a bog (about 3-4 foot round) that feeds in down into a much larger koi pond. The bog also has a water feature fountain in the middle of it and I thought it would be cool to have this working at night and the mist to float down the bog and into the pond. It does work to create mist but more for a Halloween effect in a large bowl than the elegance of a pond. (if we still lived in the city and got Halloween-ers) than I would be keeping this. But the blue led and the limited mist making range, doesn't lead to adding to the tranquility of my pond - it makes it look weird. Halloween weird is good, for my pond, not the effect I want to create."
3,some tastey tidbits,"This collection of tales has a couple of real gems (""The Elves"" and ""The Dragon Tamers"") for people looking for sources of Tolkien's ideas, and a number of ones we've all read before (""The Story of Sigurd""). As a whole, I think the collection is a bit misleading because Anderson admits in his introduction that some of the tales don't really have any connection to Tolkien at all, they are just included to show you what was being written in the field of fantasy around the turn of the century. I would rather he excluded those and just concentrated on the ones that Tolkien either said he had read or that he very likely did read. That gripe aside, the book is very well designed and presented. I liked the brief ""sidebar"" that opens each tale, but would have preferred a bit more depth there."
4,Interesting anthology,"JRR Tolkien is considered by many to be the father of modern fantasy though he often referred to the classic Beowulf. This collection looks at twenty-two stories that may have influenced him in his creation of hose adorable Hobbits. The selections were based on the premises that the tales were published before any Middle Earth story and that the author was born at least five years before Mr. Tolkien. Several were written in the nineteenth century, but were chosen because Mr. Tolkien makes reference to them in his letters or commentaries.Although not for everyone as the contributions in many cases feel a bit dated, this anthology is a fun collection. Notables are included such as Frank Stockton, Lewis Carroll, H. Rider Haggard, and L. Frank Baum, etc. Besides those curious of the genre's heritage, generalists will appreciate the tales as for the most part they are well written and worth the look back though where is the most influential, Beowulf?Harriet Klausner"
2,TALK ABOUT NOT FOLLOWING THE NOVEL......GEEZ!,"Well,I was disappointed to say the least. I bought this movie because I had read the book with my 7th grade reading class. There was NO WAY I could show this movie to them. I knew it had a R rating but figured I would take the chance. Besides all the profanity, the movie DID NOT follow S.E. Hinton's story line. Emilio Estevez (he wrote the screen play ) defiated from it in so many ways. There are too many to list now. Even the ending was totally NOT the book. The character of Mark was played by Emilio and he ""over acted"" big time. I was not impressed by him. Kim Delaney is a great actress but the character of ""Cathy"" was NOT as protrayed in the book. The character of Bryon was by far the closest of all of the characters. Oh, and the character of Charlie....it was played by Morgan Freeman. Need I say more? This is definitely the movie that upholds the cliche'....THE BOOK IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE MOVIE!!!!!!!! I say...don't waste the [money], like I did!"
3,Don't expect the book. A decent coming-of-age film.,"This film was inspired and is partly based on the S.E. Hinton novel of the same title. However, a modicum of research will tell you that Emilio Estevez wrote the screenplay, not Hinton. Ergo, do NOT expect it to be exactly like the book. Film is one medium, literature is another. To compare them is odious and unfair to both.Estevez and Sheffer both do a decent job in this emotional story of two young men who go from inseparable to at odds with one another as they begin to drift apart. Estevez wants everything to stay the same: hanging out, slacking off and committing petty crime. The bad boy image and ways will take them nowhere good, and the film's tension comes from Brian (Sheffer)learning this with help from his new girlfriend (Kim Delaney) and trying to leave it behind while Mark fights the idea only to end up a drug-damaged reprobate with a dismal future."
2,Gritty coming-of-age drama...,"If you are familiar with poverty, isolation and loneliness you'll relate to this film, which deals with such issues as dealing with family, peer pressure and growing past one's friends and surroundings. Watch for Morgan Freeman in a few scenes, his role as bar owner Charlie Woods revealing a certain depth and intensity.Unfortunately Emilio Estevez's irritating presence makes every scene he is in well nigh unwatchable. And the script seems uneven, stalling every time he and his co-star had time alone on the screen. I grew tired of watching these two hang out, waiting for something to happen. Frankly the book was better..."
3,Bad language spoils a good story.,This movie deserves its R rating. It is filled with vulgar/obscene language that was not in the book. The movie producers thus ruined a perfectly good story for young teens.
5,THIS BOOK IS AWESOME!!!!,"When i first saw this book i thought it would be just as good as the Outsiders. And it turned out it was. i think you should buy this book because its way worth more than reading twice.(my opinion,i own all of the se hinton books , they're great)"
1,"Terrible, Just Terrible","I purchased this DVD to show to my ninth grade students who just finished reading the book, which they loved. Not only did I think the movie was a terrible adaptation of the book, so did my students. The movie doesn't follow the plot of the book, the acting is pretty bad, the soundtrack is even worse, and the language is reprehensible - completely unacceptable for a school setting. This type of language wasn't even used in the novel. Why add it to the movie?Save your money. Don't buy this."
2,"Nice book, but needs reviewing","The world of technology is changing with a very rapid pace. Okay, it's a common place, but i think that books should like the apps: to be updated every X months.This is the case of this book. I humbly think that this book is fabulous, but!! In some chapters lacks to be up to date. Security is explained without the new xml notations, who made me to rewrite when I reached a point where I didn't found solutions for the problems I had even on internet!! The wiring of the security isn't explained now as simple beans, but with the new xml notation that this book lacks.On the other side, it explains very well what is spring for and why you do need Spring. Sorry planet for not knowing until now. is very important and the first chapters are recommendable even for non programmers (deployers) in order to know what the hell is Spring and how to take advantage of it's capabilities."
5,Spring in Action,"This book has helped me a lot to understand Spring basics. I liked author's writing style and it is really easy to read. Also, it is one of the most modern Spring books that covers Spring 3 and it is not too large to get bored."
2,lack detail and not touch anything deep,"1st editionthe part about configuring and wiring via xml configuration file is not detail. the problem is you can't deploy your code without correct configuration. there should be one chapter dedicated to COMPLETE xml configuration files (for persistence, transaction, other enterprise services). without it, this book is trash.there is no coverage on Spring JPA (instead author wasted on jdo and ibatis). the coverage on JMS (Spring MDB support and Spring MDP) is incomplete. the coverage on jndi (this is used in persistance, transaction, other enterprise service) is incomplete.this book is embarrassment.------------------3rd editionway too verbose. the author mentioned about luggage in airport (2 page) and bike (1 page). are you serious????"
1,Boring book,"This book contains too many unnecessay talks, and few/complete code examples. It's painful to read 8 pages without seeing one line of codes."
2,Not the best!,"I should have believed the negative reviews. Did they even try their source? They couldn't have.The explanations are fair, but the poor quality of the source examples makes you wonder."
4,"(2nd Edition) no source from Chapter5, 6,7, 10, 11,12, 13, 14, and 15.","Basically is good, but beingSpring in Actiondisappointed with missing so many chapters source code."
1,Manning has serious problems with code examples,"This is my 3rd Manning published book. They ALL lack sufficient code examples. It's almost as if they don't expect you to EVER try anything out on your own. It's ridiculous. These books are great to read and to learn from, but only if you want to do lots of work to get their horrible code examples working."
4,you can get the electronic version on Manning.com,"I was searching for electronic version. Finally, I found they have it on their own website. As for the content, I enjoy it. I also prefer the ebook version."
3,"good intro book, but ruined by many inconsistencies and careless typos","The book is decent, it presents Spring 3 in a very accessible way for beginners alike.However, the reading experience is ruined by many careless typos, it is more pronounced in Spring MVC and Spring Security chapter, which is such a pity. I will blame both the author and reviewers of the book as the Manning MEAP provide such a long time span to correct those things.Example of such inconsistency: Spring tags are defined sometimes as ""s"", sometimes as ""spring"", and mismatch and mixing in the textual descriptions and code itself. Come on, this book is written by the single author ...Also, the Manning's author online link (a forum) is pretty much useless - as many earlier readers submitted their correction, but I didn't see any author replies, and there is no official errata files to refer to.So, I don't recommend this book unless a reprint can correct those issues."
3,"This book is good, but it could be better.","I bought this book because my Java teacher told me so. I usually read a lot of reviews before buy some technical book. This one wasn't the case.This book is good, a very funny reading, but you must to read most part of it if you want to jump some pages and get a chunk of material in the middle pages. I was searching for Spring and JSF integration but the chapter begins with ""Imagine that before you had ever heard of Spring, you had already developed the RoadRantz application using JSF in the web layer."" Well, is easy to see that I didn't developed the ""RoadRantz"" application because I just want to look at JSF and Spring working together.This book is not good for quick consult. You must read it all. That's why I wrote ""it could be better"" if the author just give a single example for each chapter instead wire all book's examples up."
2,Find examples elsewhere.,I've managed to get through the first six chapters in two weeks. Although the writing style is readable for a technical book there is a glaring lack of examples other than dangling code snippets that show how to actually use Spring. The code I downloaded from the book's web site is largely incoherent and undocumented.I did manage to find several online tutorials that have been a lot more help. I recommend finding one that you like before attempting to wade past the first four chapters.
3,Good book but the source code does not work!,This is a well written book. I enjoyed the gentle introduction to spring. I was surprised with the several problems I had with the downloaded code. The code does not work and is not orgainized by chapters. I hope the second edition comes with working code.
1,Spring out of Action,"This book is poorly edited and horribly designed. The author couldn't even write a good/complete example. Go to there website now and see that their example isn't even fully implemented. They even had to rewrite the example because they ""learned"" some stuff about Spring since writting the book. I thought you had to know something about Spring to write a whole book and then you can't even write a short example? Not a good place to start to learn about Spring. To give credit where its due, the first three chapters weren't bad, but they had nothing to do about Spring."
2,Would be nice to have the code working ...not trying to debug it,"When I first started I thought the book really fulfills my expectations. Well ...that was until I reached chapter 5. From that point on the code is completely messed up. The first part is comprised of maven projects but the rest of the code is not, and is very hard to have it working. I am very disappointed because the book without the code is...useless, at least for me. :("
4,For beginners,"I was a bit disappointed by this book compared to the others from the ""In Action"" serie (I've read nearly all the books from that serie). It's not a bad book at all: it explains very well the basic concepts and goes enough into the details in this matter (the IoC design pattern and AOP concepts are not easy to understand if you're not already familiar with them. The author did a great job on this), and I was also quite happy with the code samples. But now that I have some experience with Spring, I find it doesn't go far enough into the more advanced topics. It's a very good introduction to the subject but either you'll need another book or -probably better- you'll need to read the reference documentation available from springframework.org"
2,Good book to get into Spring but very poor examples,"I have read 2 chapters so far. This book covers the modules that every developer needs to know about Spring. The think that I didn't like about the book is the silly examples the writer used. Instead of trying to be funny the writer could have used examples that make more sense like bank transactions, e-commerce, or any other real business scenarios."
1,The worst book on Spring,"Don't waste your money on this book. In preface of this book, writer has acknowledged that Spring has expanded well beyond what could be discussed in a 700- to 800-page book. In this 400 page book, writer has failed to do justice to selected topics that he has randomly picked up. I wouldn't even recommend this book to beginners."
4,"A great book, but...","There are so many errors. It really upsets me to buy a book that not only has a ton of typos and erroneous examples, but also one where there's no errata posted for the book.Outside of that, the book is well written and the concepts behind spring are described very well. If you want a really good book on spring, try Pro Spring (Apress)."
4,Excellent Book,This is an excellent and awesome book. This third edition has reached a maturity level that is rare to find in other Java technical books. This is why I rated it with 4 starts - 5 stars are for the perfect books only :)
1,A Bad Idea.,Spends too much time ranting about knights tales than actually teaching you simple concepts in Spring that you can use. I ended up going to meet someone who somehow understood the Spring Concepts better than the authors. If you have limited knowledge of how frameworks of any kind work and you don't want to spend your limited time on the internet avoid this book.
4,Best Spring book I have seen in the market,We use Spring extensively in our company and I think this is a must have book for everyone working/learning spring
3,The Perfect Guide to Spring,This is a fantastic voyage to the realm of Spring Framework. Is well written and organized. The author describe in a simple way the architecture and main features of the framework. Excellent Book!!!!
1,Expected better,"Unlike the other reviewers, I did not appreciate this book. Not being one to leave a book unfinished, I persisted despite my deepening dislike. The plot is fast-paced only because the text skips from high point to high point because so few events of any importance happen. The main characters are shallowly delineated, and the peripheral ones even more so. The author attempts to humanize and empathize with the mass-murdering, psychotic antagonist (no spoilers, he's described as such on the jacket) but really tries too hard with too little effect. The protagonists scarcely seem like real people. While the book is sumptuously researched (how accurately, I don't know), the details tend to fall flat. Save your time and read something more recent and more interesting."
3,Spend the extra money for a Furman,"On the good side, it does work, and the digital display is nice. The quality appears good... At first.On the second day of owning it, a bad connection in the left light tube developed, and it only works intermittently. After 10 days, the power switch failed, and now it won't turn off. After removing the unit from my rack, opening it up, I gave the blade connectors a tug. Now the power switch works, but does not 'click'... Else it works fine... But the power switch is kind of an important part of the unit. I will need to find a replacement.I now wish I had spent a bit more for a Furman, who are known for their power conditioners, vs Nady, who once made a popular wireless for guitars."
4,A Beverly Clearly Book,"This book is OK. It is not the best, not the worst but it is an enjoyable read. I reccomend it for 4th or 5th graders."
4,This is a cute story.,"This book is aimed at teenagers, but could be enjoyable for someone of any age. It's about a girl whose older sister is getting married ""too young"" in a kind of spur-of-the-moment wedding, but the family pulls together and makes everything work. The protagonist of the book learns about teamwork, new perspectives and what it's like to grow up. It's a great read-aloud story and an enjoyable way to occupy an afternoon."
4,Sister of the Bride great read,"Have you ever been a brother or sister of the bride and felt left out? If so, read Sister of the Bride by Beverly Cleary. This book gave me many different feelings such as happiness, sadness and sometimes confusion. This, I am sure, is how the main character, Barbara, felt at one time or another. Having her older sister getting married while her sister is still in college, and thinking about falling love and dating herself. All this could send mixed feelings to anyone. But then when things get a little topsie-turvy who knows what will happen to either of the girls' relationship."
3,Sister Of The Bride,"Sister of the Bride is cute. It is about Barbara MacLane who finds out that her older sister, Rosemary is getting married. She wants to ensure that Rosemary will get a beautiful wedding but Rosemary has turned into a practical person- while Barbara is having boy troubles of her own- first with her annoying brother Gordy, and then with Tootie Bodger, who is 6'4, and Bill Cunningham, who is implied as handsome and gives her rides of his Vespa.I have read all four books of first love by Beverly Cleary and this is the only book that I give 3 stars- the others are all 4's or 5's. It becomes boring after quite some time. After all, who wants to hear about the Amys' shower? That part was boring. But overall you can find an enjoyable read in this, although it is mediocre."
5,"This is a great book with heart, wit, and humor.","I read this book when I was about 8 years old.I still remember all of the little things like the naive narration, the wonderful descriptions, and the heartfelt tale of a little sister watch her beloved big sis get married."
3,inaccuracies.. typos?,"There is a lot of good info in this book. There are a few inaccuracies also, which could be attributed to simple typographical errors or a lack of proof reading before printing. It's a shame, because there IS a wealth of information here. The problem is, in my mind, it's been relegated to the ""can't be trusted"" category. Great informational reading if you already know what information is correct and what's not. ..and if you do, why are you reading this book? I wouldn't base an engine build off of this book."
1,Quite disappointing.,"Pretty disappointing by this movie. I was hoping for a campy monster movie, but nope. I can't think of a single positive thing to say about this movie. It's an action/adventure movie...and a very bad one. If you do decide to watch this movie (for whatever reason), I recommend skipping the first 30 minutes. Nothing of value happens."
1,Horrible,"If I could give less than 1 star I would, Worst movie ever!! Do not waste you time or money on this onem it has no plot and the acting is way below standard."
1,Terrible,It has to be one of the worst movies I have ever viewed. No plot and terrible acting. Dont waste your money on this one.
5,"Beware Of The Pig, The Hippie and the hillbilly","For a straight to dvd movie. this movie is pretty good. i thought the actors were great the story was weird, but thats what makes this movie unique. all in all this movie was good. If you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do"
3,THIS AIN'T NO PORKY,"PIG HUNT is the first FANGORIA FRIGHTFEST entry I've seen and it's one wild ride! Makes DELIVERANCE's hillbillies look like Campfire girls!While a little ponderous at times, the movie is never boaring (ha ha)and there is much tension in awaiting the inevitable confrontation with ""The Ripper.""Alas, this is where the movie comes apart. The pig effects are pretty lame and the whole hippie commune is just too far out IMO.BUT it kept my interest and I look forward to the other Frightfest flicks."
3,Honestly not that bad...,Pighunt...Well it is different lol! This movie starts out with a group of Friends going hunting. It goes in all different directions from there! It was interesting enough to keep my attention and there is a bit of suspense. I found it entertaining and a bit of fun to be honest. Not great but I have seen FAR worse! I am a huge Horror fan so I have seen the Best to the Worst. Worth a rental for sure and then decide about a purchase would be my recommendation. Hope this helps :)
4,"Hippies, Hillbillies, & The Godzilla Pig","Length:: 8:22 MinsDirected by James Isaac (Jason X, Skin Walkers)Soundtrack by Les Claypool from Primus3000 pound Boar, great pacing, and lots of gore!It's rare we get a creature/animal attack flick,so a solid one is always a welcome addition."
2,Eh...,"An interesting premise that doesn't really excite in execution. The story line twist wasn't necessary. Should have bothered with the ""cult"" in the story."
4,Not Bad At All!!,"Ya know guys, for a movie that was simply about some guys who go into the woods to hunt a demon pig, this movie was actually very very good with many enriching elements. The setting was good and the costumes of the characters was very beleiveable. This move really exceeded my expectations and keep me up until it was done."
2,Jay-Z song is a classic but the rest is garbage,"One of the best Jay-Z songs of his young career is hidden on this trashy CD. A classic song about the travels from the projects to the riches of Hollywood featuring his project-mates Memphis Bleak.Don't buy this CD, just find the Jay-Z song and download it."
5,Great cd,"If you are wondering this soundtrack is reaally great Ice cube & Master p that is my jam , Then Changing Faces Same tempo, We be clubbin, Brownstone, and Others I can listen to this cd all day Because I purchased the edited version."
3,Not that bad but not that good,"""The Players Club"" follows the same format as we have seen with many other soundtracks lately, a couple of good cuts filled in with filler by artists we hope to never hear from again. It suffers every time Ice Cube isn't on a track. The R&B is weak. Ice Cube fans would probably better off looking for one of his solo albums. All that said, unlike most of the other soundtracks lately it all seems to go together and really reminds me of a weaker, softer version of the 1994 ""Menace II Society"" soundtrack. The CD isn't great and really only should be bought by people who love these sort of soundtracks that seem to come out every week. Others should hope that Cube puts his ""We Be Clubbin' (remix)"" with DMX on one his own albums."
2,ugly bra,"You have to adjust your breast to put in these bras. Also your tops look horrible in them like you stuffed you chest with tissue.They do have great support, but they way you will look in it will make you feel funny"
1,Monroe Deserves Better,"This was terrible. I don't even know where to start. The book was extraordinarily boring. At least the parts I could understand was boring, usually I was just confused. The one useful thing I gleaned from the book had nothing to do with Monroe. It was written in the 40's by (I believe) a professor at the Univ of Virginia. The book was remarkably pro-slavery, or at least, anti-anti-slavery. It shows how some were still smarting over abolition from 75 years earlier. Whatever. Even if you're a pro-slavery holdout, you can surely find a better book than this one."
3,Writerly stuff,"How many more works of fiction do you want to read where the main character is a writer?Karoo is a (re)writer of screen plays, not coming to terms with mid-life perhaps, but aware he can write.Tesich knows he can write. He flaunts his virtuosity.But he hasn't written a novel. It's just a narrative in the first person, mildly amusing and not really memorable."
2,French Audio CD,"Although I believe the sequence of the training is good, I would have liked the CD to strictly follow the book. The tape also uses several French speakers and they all pronounce the words very differently, which to a beginner like me, is very confusing. The intent was good as they wanted folks to hear people with French accents from all over the world; however, to someone hearing and learning the language for the first time, I personally found this to be frustrating. For my level of expertise (none), I needed consistency in pronunciation and pronunciation I could understand so I could repeat. Folks who already are familiar with the language, may find this CD useful."
3,Lonely Planet Frustrates in Kindle Edition,"Hi. I am actually in Bhutan as I write this. We are a ""Lonely Planet"" only household and travel consistently throughout the year. But, Lonely Plan for Bhutan on a Kindle is driving me crazy! Often ""click on"" does not go to the correct section. Maps are too small (even with Aa) to do much good. And you really need color for maps. So, there is still is the great information, but the Kindle edition leaves something to be desired. I am about to go out and buy the paper copy."
5,Best guide for Bhutan,"Bhutan is such a special country that I needed a small guide to take with me, and this covers everything I could want. It is tricky to get into the country and you need an ""official"" tour company and this is explained in detail so there are no surprises. Plan way ahead as the paperwork takes time - your agency does this for you. The maps are very good as are descriptions of sites; the ""20 top experiences"" with photos at the beginning will send you in the right direction. The survival guide in the back is thorough and answers any question you could think of. Once again, a terrific Lonely Planet guide (I have tons)."
5,Most current book on the subject that I can find.,There is a lot of info to prepare me on my upcoming trip. Book is not too heavy and large so it will easily fit into a camera bag or purse.
4,Insightfull and Practical,"If you desire to understand better the principles and processes involved with the preparation and delivery of the expository sermon, this is the book you need.Athough the book is not a ""How To"" for expository preaching, it does give helpful advise for the study and preparation of the expository sermon. Never before did I realize all of the different elements that are involved in accurately proclaiming the Word of God. By applying these easy to understand principles of study and delivery, there is no doubt that my preaching has progressed to the next level.If preaching the Word with accuracy and clarity is your desire in ministry, this book is a must."
3,THIS WAS CREATED FOR OR FROM THE KEEBLER ELVES!,This is a decent set but I was a little hesitant after reading some of the reviews regarding the size of this set. Let me just say this was either created by or for the KEEBLER ELVES. I can't imagine what kind of idiot would make such a small set. I took it out of the box and me and my wife were cracking up at the tiny size. It really looks like a childrens play broom & dustpan set. I guess you can use this for fast clean ups and small rooms. If you're planning on getting this for large jobs/rooms FORGETABOUTIT!
3,Short changed on the broom!,"The dustpan is just fine picks everything up nicely but for the price of this outfit, the broom should have been close to the top of the line for broom and dustpan sets."
3,Too short...,"I am 5'1"" and I feel that the broom is too short. I did not check the measurements before buying because I thought it would be adult size. I gave it 3 stars because it still serves its purpose and it is good for spot clean ups. I live in an apt and there is not a big area to sweep."
4,Compact and convenient,The upright part is really important. A little hard to hold onto the broom handle but it can be done and certainly beats having to bend down with a little brush.
1,"Broom too short, dustpan doesn't stay flush with floor","This combo looked like another great design from OXO. Unfortunately, it has 2 critical flaws.1) The broom is waaay too short. I'm 5'5"" and my girlfriend is 5'3"", both of us cannot use this broom without bending over completely. It's just flat out too short.2) The dustpan doesn't stay flush with the ground unless you step on it, which makes for very slow cleaning.I know how much weight the OXO brand carries, but pass on this item."
2,small,Not a normal size broom so hard to work with-so yes the dustpan is small also. Only good for small jobs where as I needed it for my whole house
1,Second hand,"This item came to us with one inch all around of the broom part discolored and dust hanging from it in used condition. Obviously a former returned item, not inspected and sent to us in used dirty condition. Not funny."
5,Great little broom and dustpan set,"I brought this broom and dustpan set to do quick cleanups in my chinchillas' room. Remember that dirt line that never disappeared no matter how much you swept? Well you won't have that problem any longer with this set. It gets rid of it the first time around.Some people have complained that it's a bit short, but it's okay for me because I'm short. It's still better than bending down and picking up the garbage any day. This is a great set for those quick pick-me-ups."
3,not very ergonomic!,"As a fan of all OXO good grips products, I expected this upright dustpan to be better than others. Yes it is light weight and that is nice,but it is designed all wrong! When using it, my wrist has to move in a way where it has no strength: the handle should make a 90 degree turnfor it to work with the body. Especially when you call your line good grips! People of OXO, most of your products are excellent, but pleasego back to the drawing board for this one. It will cause my wrist to hurt if I'd use it frequently.Last request: a more cheerful color (it is not silver, but grey), or white like your other products. Orange, yellow or green would be nice too."
3,"Indeed, Very Short","I read another review about how short this broom was, but decided to get it anyway. It is, indeed, very short. I had to bend over and I am a college student about 5'6"" tall. I wouldn't recommend this broom for 5'6"" and taller. Also, the plastic dustpan keeps flipping up; sometimes it's hard to keep the edge on the floor when you're sweeping. Overall, difficult to use for the 5'6"" or taller person."
3,Too short,"Who is this broom made for? It's so short. I'm thinking of sending it back because I'm unable to use it. I'm 5'5""."
3,Broom mediocre,"The dustpan is fine, although the handles on both parts are too short.However, my main problem is that I find the broom simply does not sweep well...it takes more workthan it should to get things swept up with this.The nesting of the broom using the plastic grabber on the dust pan handle is not all that reliable, either.It gradually bends open."
4,"heavy broom, good dustpan",This is overall a good set. It is doing what it is supposed to do. The dustpan is well constructed. The broom on the other hand is not so good. The broom is heavy and can wear my wrist down easily. I would like the broom to be lighter and the bristles thinner and softer to do a thorough job on the wood floor.
2,Great for Kids!,"I am 5'6"" and this is WAY too short for me to use. It has been great for the kids to sweep under the kitchen table though. I think they made this as a toy and didn't state that in the description. It is not a standard size broom."
4,Oxo good Grips Upright Broom and Dustpan Set,"Well made product, but the broom is a little too short to sweep with comfortably (and I'm only 5'3"".) Also it is a bit difficult to get the broom back into the dustpan for storage without bending the bristles that stick out the sides. Easy to store because it stands up by itself and doesn't take up much room. Brush does a good job of picking up dust and dirt and it is easy to sweep debris into the dust pan."
5,Great product!,"This works well, is designed well and is of good quality. It's great for those with chronic back pain and a help for others too."
1,Flimsy Dustpan,"Tho OXO is a respected name, this dustpan set doesn't quite make it. The lip on the pan is too thick and does not pick up the sweepings well. Further, after a few uses, the flimsy dustpan flaps open and close at will when I go to empty the pan. Better to get a set that doesn't have the 'upright' feature."
3,"Works fine, but handles are too short","This is fine for small jobs. I bought this so that I wouldn't have to bend down to the floor to sweep up the dirt. Unfortunately, the handles are very short, so you still have to bend over. I'm only 5'1"", and I even find it to be too short. Also, the broom is smaller, more narrow than most regular brooms. The dust pan works fine, but again the handle is short and sits at a strange angle. I feel that it should bend backwards a bit to make it easier to set it flat on the floor for sweeping in the dirt. For the price, it's worth it for small jobs. Just be aware that it is short."
3,Fair,"I ordered this broom/dustpan set mainly for the dustpan. (I knew the broom that came with the set would not be tall enough for very much real sweeping) I usually love Oxo products, but this one is unimpressive. When sweeping, there is still that line of dust that has to be repeatedly swept into the dustpan. I think there is a slight curve at the end strip. Also, my old dustpan was a much bigger size. I suggest that you keep looking..."
3,A well made broom set for children,I like most of what OXO makes but this broom and dust pan set is designed for children. The broom is only 37 inches tall and 8 inches wide. I will just go with what they have at Home Depot.
4,A Good Set,"I really like the set, but the broom is a little short. I just decided to get a longer broom and use it with the dust pan part. It does work well. It' just a little short for me nothing that can't be overcome."
2,Too short to be useful!,"The broom and dust pan were too short to be useful. Both were about hip-height, so they were hard to maneuver. In addition, the bristles were damaged upon arrival. I ended up returning the item."
3,A Little Small,"I like the style of dust pan that comes with this broom, but I feel the broom itself is a little too small."
1,Height is the killer!,"The broom seemed like a convenient purchase and I thought since I'm only 5'2"" it would be fine, but the height of the broom is so very uncomfortable! I have to hunch over to properly maneuver the broom. I do not recommend this item!"
2,much too small,"I'm five foot four. When I read the reviews saying that this broom was small, I thought ""doesn't matter! I'm short! It'll be fine."" It is not fine. This broom is literally half the size of a normal broom, making it impossible to sweep the floor without hunching over. After a single room my back aches and I'm cursing this broom. Why, Oxo? Why did you make this teeny tiny broom? Is it meant to be a child's toy? Is it meant for leprechauns? I don't understand, I am baffled and dismayed, and my back hurts. I need a new broom."
2,Doesn't Stay Upright Very Well,"I would not purchase this product. It is made for a shorter person like most of the reviewers have said, but that is not the reason I don't like it. It does not stay upright very easily. I store it on the floor in a closet and almost every time I open the door the broom and dust pan handle fall to the floor. It is very annoying that I cannot get the dust pan handle and broom to stay upright the majority of the time!"
2,Small Size,"I should have paid more attention to the size of this item. It is very small. I am 5'4"" and it's quite short for me to use. The broom also has a very small head. It is otherwise nice, and I'd love it if it were about 30% larger. As it is, it won't be sufficient to be the primary broom to clean my house, which is all wood floors."
3,Disappointed,"I purchased this to replace the Rubbermaid set I had had for years when the broom disappeared during our kitchen remodel. I opted not to buy a new Rubbermaid because for some reason they have become overly expensive. What a mistake!The broom handle on the Oxo is too short, requiring me to bend over further than is comfortable. Being 5'6"", I'm not tall. Also, the dustpan latches in the open position. This is fine while sweeping but makes it difficult to insert the broom into the dustpan and connect the two pieces for hanging. My last gripe probably only pertains to my particular storage set up--the hole for hanging is lower on the handle than I would like, making it tricky to mount it on the hook I have available for it. None of these were problems with the Rubbermaid."
5,Oxo is the best,This broom is the best I have ever had. It picks up everything you are sweeping. I don't have to go over and over the spot to get the items I'm picking up. Broom and duspan are easily stored. So glad I purchased 2!!
3,OK set,"this is definetly a short broom/dustpan set. works great. i got 2 - to keep one by each cat box. it's perfect for quick sweeps of loose litter. you can empty it or leave for later. stands fine against the wall. flip the dustpan up, or leave flat; either way, the broom snaps to it. a good buy for cat lovers.UPDATE: 06/26/12. Not so great. After about 1 yr of use, the bristles stick out and the broom does not fit into the dust pan well. Disappointed. Will go back to ""regular"" style (which i couldn't find when i bought these last year); i still like the short set. Changed from ""great little set"" to ""OK set""; changed from 5 stars to 3 stars. Had expected better quality."
3,A little short,"I really like this recent purchase, but I have to admit that at 5'7"" - it's a little short. My hubby and I are the same height and we both have to bend over to use this properly. We've thought about giving it to my mother in law who is 5'1"" since it would probably be the perfect height for her. Just a word of caution. Otherwise it is great! I love the dustpan being so handy!"
5,The Upright Sweep Set is perfect for my need.,"Having been born on Halloween; I, like most witches, have had lots of experience with brooms. Being a wizened witch at the age of 93, I need a short, light-weight broom that fits my size and picks up litter with a minimum of sweeping. Hard as it is for me to bend over, I need a long-handled dust pan that does not tilt and spill the dirt. It even stores upright, in a small space. The Oxo Good Grips Upright Sweep Set is perfect for me. Perhaps it could even be ridden safely on my next full moon venture.Alberta Patch-Slegaitis."
3,Not nearly as good as you would expect,"From looking at the picture and that this comes from OXO, you would think this upright sweeper would be convenient to use. Unfortunately, it really isn't. The dustpan part doesn't easily go flat when you need it to. Instead you find yourself taking your hand and forcing the dustpan into position. This of course misses the whole point of the upright sweep set. Although it looks like a home version of many of the sweep sets you see out at the mall and what not, the plastic and design makes it a pain to use. My wife was pretty disappointed with it and ended up just going out and buying another broom."
4,Helpful tools,This broom and dustpan set is a real help. As I have gotten older it is more difficult for me to bend over. This set enables me to do my chores without as much discomfort. The dust pan works better than I thought it would.
1,way too short,"i had to bend over to use it and i'm only 5'4"". Even my 10 year old daughter felt it wasn't tall enough. And it's like a kid's broom. Too small, too short, love the concept, but hated it andthrew it out"
2,Poor Quality Broom,You'll do much better with a Hoky broom or a Swiffer. The bristles on the Oxo Good Grips do a poor job of picking up debris and dust and that which is picked up is difficult to empty into a garbage can.
1,Great Kids Broom,Its a real nice kids broom... If your under 5 ft tall this broom works perfect. It is very short and I suggest buying one with a longer handle.
2,Way too short,"I'm really surprised to see such positive reviews for this product. The dustpan is fine, but the broom is ridiculously small. I'm 5'9"" and have to bend completely over to use it. It looks like it was made for a child. I'm really disappointed. I'm going to have to replace the broom, because this one will kill my back if I try to use it."
5,Delicious!,"My friend started bringing me these whenever she leaves the island. I have to say that I am glad I found them at Amazon. I don't mind buying them by the case at all! They are perfectly crispy thin and the taste is just wonderful. I hide them from my husband. If I have a case, I guess I will share. Maybe he won't like them! :)"
4,Marriner does excellent Haydn,"Deciding to expand upon my classical music collection by checking out Haydn, I picked up a set of 4 London symphonies. I later found out there were two missing from a series of 6 and found this CD had those 2 on it. Well, it was a lucky find because Marriner's performance of these symphonies is fantastic! I will certainly seek out more by him in the orchestral field.The symphonies themselves are fine products of the classical period. Haydn's later symphonies tend to be for larger ensembles than his main body of work, and these are full and bombastic. Not quite up to Beethoven's more dramatic works, but probably equal to Beethoven's lesser symphonies (which are still pretty fantastic)."
3,Bewildered in Berlin,Bewildered in Berlin is one of her newer (a relative term as she has been writing since the 20's) titles and has bypassed her mid century funk that effected the dialogue in some of her other books. It is the story of a girl who is desperate to save her father from the Kaiser. She meets a British foreign agent and they work together to get the three of them out of hostile Germany intact.
4,Used by hand,"I used these to label my frozen and fresh foods, very handy so you know when something will go bad and don't have to rely on the nose test! They are a perfect size, but I have not used them in a printer so cannot comment on their full use."
5,Stuck!,I love this for folder labels they let me label over and over and over again.... and over and over
2,it has basics,"but that is about all, there is not much information on anything in the book, i think it is for those who are just entering the world of Anime"
4,Good Historic Review,"The book gives you a pretty good look on how manga developed over the years, and delivers what it promises in the beginning: help you understand how the manga world works. All in all is an amazing book if you want to know more about how manga turned out so differently from american comics. For a real comparison between american comics and manga thou, I'd recommend Paul Gravett's book which does it beautifully. Schodt's work was first published in 1983, so numbers are outdated, and you can't really use it as standards for present manga market, but it gives you great look on how the market itself looked like before the decline in the 1990s.Like I said before, if you're looking to find out how manga came to be, some about Osamu Tezuka and the differences between shonen and shoujo manga, this book is perfect."
4,The first comprehensive English language study of Japanese comics.,"Frederick Schodt's Manga, Manga! was the first American book to really explore the world of Japanese Manga. It gives a fine history of the development of manga, with the pre-war ancestors, to the post-war boom. Its subsequent chaptaers explore major genres and categories from the world of manga, plus key creators, like Osamu Tezuka. If it has any failing, it's that a second volume or revised and expanded work is desperately needed, to encompass the wealth of material that followed its publication. Any student of comic history, manga, or collector of great art should own this book."
3,The series is losing steam,"The characters and ""scenes"" described are getting more and more the same. I don't see much variety from the first few books in the series, and to be honest, I'm getting bored of the same old ""romances."" This is a raunchy series, and things are described well, just the same expressions and descriptions used often. For adults only!"
4,***LOVE ALL THE WOLF TALES***,"I LOVE ALL THESE BOOKS BECAUSE THEY HAVE HOT, HOT, HOT SEX. THIS ONE DIDN'T CAPTURE ME QUITE AS MUCH WITH THE STORY BUT THE SEX IS ALWAYS GREAT! HOPE THIS HELPS."
2,I hope theres a PA version!!!,Cuttin' and scratchin' to cover up curse words just don't cut it. Would make a great album for little kids who don't need to hear all that swearin'!
3,"it fits, but not as good as the original","Yes, it fits my 5550 model vacuum cleaner, but I have to give some force to push it in in order to lock it. Also the quality is not as good as the filter came with the vacuum cleaner. The original fits well and outter body had extra fiber-glass like liner, but not this one, it just plain paper. The original filter lasted me 5 years, I don't think this one will last."
3,GE 61770 Filter,"I would have liked the shipping method to have been clear(the return appeared to be using UPS;turned out to be USPS & resulted in a delay since I use a PO Box). The company did respond immediately when questioned and reshipped without any hassle.The item is not the original manufacturer's filter, as promised (and priced), but from co-manufacturer which is a slightly inferior quality but also works."
5,Great Product-Great Price-B & M-Great Seller!,"Seller was VERY FAST in shipping, and filter came in great package.Will definitely use B & M again.......F. Keith SchmidtMedicine Lodge, Ks."
4,Extremely Pleased with this Product.,I was very happy withe the replacement filter. I was also pleased with the entire process with Amazon.
2,ozzification,"despite a colorful premise- a festival celebrating the centennial of the wizard of oz- a surprisingly lackluster whodunit. author's usual vivid sense of place and some interesting tidbits of ozinalia; but thin on the whole,an anemic effort."
1,NOT CATS HOTTEST CASE.....,"I enjoy Cat Marsala mysteries, and was excited to pick this title up. It started out with some drama but soon lost its way, and became boring. I didn't care for the way Cats family treated her, nor was there anything going on romantically, which is something I like to catch up on. I think it could have been developed further, I would have liked to have known what the lieutenants reaction was at the end, and seen Cats family eating some crow. I guess I am not into Oz either, Brian D'Amatos notes (?) at the end were probably the biggest mystery."
3,Ending Too Fast,"I liked this book. I think the key to reading this trilogy is to read them apart from one another. I read the first book about 2 or 3 months ago. Then I read this one. A lot of people are complaining about this book being a lot like the first book, Ready. Well they are, but you'll enjoy them more if you put some time between them. I'm not going to go into the plot because so many already have. I just felt that the characters could have been explored more fully. I agree with a previous poster that Josie fell into bed too fast and too easily. I wanted her to stand up to him more and be the way her character is explained in the beginning. I'm tired of weak female characters that need a man to ""save"" them. It's crap. I thought the ending wrapped up way too fast and way too easy. The first one of the series was better. Let's hope that the final book in the trilogy is better. I'll get to in a month or so. I would recommend it as a good middle book in the trilogy."
2,Cheesy dialog and a 26 y/o virgin was too much to take,"I was surprised how highly this book was rated. I have read a lot of books in this genre -- the spicy, romance novels -- but this book does not measure up. The dialog between h/h was at times soooo cheesy and unbelievable. I thought my eyes were going to permanently stick to the back of my head from rolling them back so much. I personally would not recommend this book, not even for the sex scenes."
5,"Man, I feel like a woman!","This was very sexy. I thought Nitro/Daniel was an incredible hero. Maybe I'm just a sucker for a sexy man's man and a damsal in distress! But, I just love a man who protects his woman with a fierce intensity! It's a fantasy world, and what do we read fiction for? To live in a fantasy world.I have read all three in this series and am praying Lucy carries it on because these three men are some of the sexiest men I've ever read about!"
4,Sexy and sharp,"I'm very into Lucy Monroe's writing style. Her characters are vivid and very real to me. This second book in here Merc series was great, better than the first, but there was something missing. I guess I wanted to see a little more of the Mercs in action and I thought Josie fell into bed with Nitro a little to soon."
2,Not so good!,"The first book Ready was fantastic. As a matter of fact I added it to my current collection of great books. However, the 2nd book in my opinion is boring. I am truly struggling getting through it. I am truly surprised at all the great reviews and maybe I am not taking the time I need with this but I cannot wait to finish it. I hate it when authors start of really good with a series and you really look forward to the next book and its just bad! I was not impressed! Sorry!"
4,Lucy Monroe hits it out of the ballpark again!,"I love Lucy Monroe books especially her Harlequin Presents books. Willing was a great read. It was more like 4 1/2 stars! This book is the second in a series. The first is titled Ready and the last is titled And Able. All of them have heroes who are ex-mercenaries. The heroine in this particular one is also an ex-mercenary soldier. And Able is my favorite of the three in this series, but Willing is good too!"
2,Very poor/immature dialogue and ...,"unbelievable, naive, and not so bright heroine (e.g., completely ignorant about sex at 26 yrs, yeah right) - yet she is a great mercenary."
2,dissapointed,"I have purchased 3 pairs of doc's in my lifetime. The first pair, shoes, I bought about 5 years ago. They were great comfortable shoes and lasted a good 4 years. This year I purchased a replacement pair of shoes and a pair of boots (the ones I am reviewing). Both the new shoes and the boots started to squeak within a few weeks of owning them. I'm not talking about squeaking on the floor, they actually squeak somewhere within the shoe/boot. It seems like it is coming from between the leather part and the sole. I'm not saying that this is the cause, but, the two new pairs were both made in china. The original pair was not. Coincidence?I won't be buying doc's again."
3,"correct product, on time, as expected",ccrrect product delivered as stated on time. All the details I like in an online store.
5,Great work boots.,"I bought these for my husband's birthday because his work boots were super worn out and these ones are awesome. We knew they would be though because they are Dr. Martens. They were very high quality and good looking as well. At the time I bought these they had an awesome price probably because of some slight defect but you can't even tell. Sometimes the inside label is sewn on upside down, so they mark the product down. Don't hesitate to buy!! By the way I got the volcano colored ones."
5,"Tough as nails, yet easy on the feet.","I had to ""break in"" these boots for about a week. After that, they have been the BEST pair of DMs I've owned. I can't find anything that I don't like about them. The black inlay in the tread is unusual, where this is the first pair I've seen or owned that had it. It feels like it is a harder, denser plastic composition than the tan tread surrounding it. Not sure what the black inlay does (for aesthetics?), as the comfort is just like that of other ""Air Ware"" DMs I own. BTW: I bought them from Amazon, and they shipped them in blazing-fast time."
4,Excellent - Both as a Textbook and as a Reference Book,"This was my textbook for fifth and sixth semester German. I thoroughly enjoyed using this textbook for several reasons: (1) The reading passages at the beginning of each chapter are sufficiently advanced to challenge students in the third year, but are not so advanced as to make trying to read them futile. (2) The ""Grammatik"" (Grammar) sections are nice, in that they succinctly lay out the finer points of grammar using both text and example sentences. (3) In the ""Das passende Wort"" sections, readers are taught the differences in context among many German verbs and nouns - especially helpful when German has several different words for a single English word.My only complaint with this book is that, as a student, it would have been helpful from time to time to have more examples here and there of some of the trickier grammar and context material. Overall, excellent!"
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER BOUGHT!!!!,"This book is awesome, one of the best mystery books ever wrote. It's all non fiction, dealing with everything from ghosts, ufos, monsters, satanism, possession, etc. Very large and full of vintage pictures and news clippings-its like if Unsolved Mysteries was a book, the entire series in one.I first read this book when my mother had it back in the 90's. I kept it when I moved, but it got lost. One day I found another copy in a flee marker in St. Criox Falls Wisconsin and quickly bought it, during a move it went missing. I then found another at an online auction, then accidentally left it in a patrol vehicle at work and never saw it again. I then got it at another online auction and someone borrowed it last year and never returned it. Needless to say after I buy this book again I will have bought, lost and owned this book many times. Its worth getting."
4,Well worth seeing.,"I found this film a pleasure to experience. Sophie Ward is stunning. She carries the film as she beautifully captures in a subtle, complex, and very compelling performance, the emotional changes her character is going through. I look forward to seeing it again."
4,A Village Affair,"Sweet story and the best lesbian seduction scene ever. However, I was very disappointed at the ending. It's a wonder they didn't have a tree fall on her (the evil lesbian). It's my understanding that this film belied the book's ending so that's a bummer. Kerry Fox was great, as always. And Sophie Ward, well, you go girl!"
1,Predictable and Boring,"If you are a soap opera fan, then this may fill the bill. Throw in a meddling mother-in-law, a token lesbian affair, a flirtatious but bewildered husband and a few kids, and there you have it. If you find this movie in the $1.00 bin, then it might be worth buying."
5,Outstanding customer service,I have ordered from this company before and they continue to give outstanding customer service: (1)product is as described; (2) it is delivered fast; (3)competitive prices.
2,More WWE less ECW,"This PPV stinks. There were only 3 good matches at ONS and they were:The Steel Cage match for the World's title,the 6 man tag team table match & the ladder match for the World tag team championship. The worst matches were the Pudding match which was pointless as teaching a dog how to speak human and the lumberjack match which was dumb as the movie:FROM JUSTIN TO KELLY. the rest were second to third-rate. I give this event a 5 out of 10."
3,Not An ECW Show!,"Amazon needs to make a correction for this listing. It is no longer ECW One Night Stand. It is WWE One Night Stand. All future pay per view events from this point forward will be WWE(all 3 brands) shows. Raw, SmackDown and ECW will combine for this show. Hopefully people won't pre-order this show expecting an event similar to the previous 2 One Night Stand shows."
4,!!ECW is NO longer Extreme!!,"Overall its a good PPV, Good Matches.No more blood, no more I have to kill myself in order to have one more meal type of matches, the fans should understand that now that WWE writes huge paychecks, there is NO need to bleed to death for pennies.Arenas have air conditioning, there clean, etc.In my personal opinion, Smackdown should disappear and merge with the ECW, now that the matches are exactly the same, just the brand is different."

4,Postage Labels,The postage labels arrived quickly and performed as expected. I have used very inexpensive labels and these worked well above the standard.
3,Measuring Up,"Mr. Stein's new book, though flawed, is certainly a cut above the rest of his books. His biographical sketches are kind and light-hearted. The story technique is well-crafted and flows smoothly. The interviews have depth and clarity. The dialog is witty and understated. He portrays all the characters, including himself, with affectionate charm. In stark contrast to, and interspersed in, this delightful story, are pages of hackneyed, dreary, mean-spirited moralizing. They reveal Mr. Stein's darker side, that of a pompous, judgmental misogynist. Perhaps if wiser editing prevails, Mr. Stein's future books will be worthy of his talent. I'm looking forward to his next effort."
5,A Step Back In Time,"For those of us who grew up in the pre-WWII era, we can identify with the tales of pre-war, wartime, and post-war discussions which are bandied about among guys who were mostly service veterans. Harry Stein has adroitly delved into the personalities of each, and one feels that he knows each of the cast personally by the end of the reading. From the blunt but innocence of ""Moe,"" we are privy to the earthy approach of some of the others. We get to know about the mental acumen of ""Cooper"" and are saddened by his physical deterioration. Kudos to Harry Stein for bringing us another version, but focused on fewer people, of ""The Greatest Generation."""
5,Marriage and Life Changing!,"My husband raves about this incredible book, even though he's never read it! He has commented several times on the obvious changes in my character as a result of the principals in this book. Virginia Lefler is not only spiritual and biblical in this incredible breakdown of a wife's role and worth to God, but she's practical.There are clear examples of what to do and how to do it, in order to follow God's plan in your marriage. My life is now less stressful and confusing as I am following the scriptures and Virginia's down to earth advice based on 34 years of her own successful marriage.Upon meeting her recently, I realized that she practices what she preaches and enjoys the peace that comes along with being a Gentle Quiet Spirit.If you want to be a peaceful and happy wife, get this book!"
5,Amazing!!!,"What an amazing book! It was as if Virgina had been in my marriage since day one! She was able to touch on fears and desires of the average woman and was then able to calm our anxious hearts and help us move on, not only through her words, but through the scriptures. I have to confess that at times it was hard to read, because I was convicted by my attitudes and my behavior toward my husband. But I kept going back to the book, it drew me in. I am forever thankful for Ms Lefler and her wisdom. I am sure that my husband and family are grateful as well."
5,Great purchase,"I've had a couple of other covers for my grill, but this one is much heavier and is a perfect fit. I can tell it will last; it was well worth the money."
3,charbroil 65 inch cover,"The cover is advertised at full length, but it is actually 3 inches too short to cover the Char Broil grill completely. We had a Charmglow cover previously on the grill and it fit properly, a shame the competition actually has a better fitting cover for your product."
5,This cover was great,This cover fits the grill and has been very enjoyable to use. The color is perfect and goes with the pool furniture.
1,Would rate lower if possible...,"This cheap piece of junk tore in about the first 45 seconds of using it. I was literally just putting it over my grill after opening the package when it tore. It's that bad. Total waste of money! Do not buy this, you will be sorry!"
1,Not worth the money,Not 65 inches very cheep and thin if it fit I am sure it wouldn't last the winter..I advise not buying this cover.
2,Excited at first...,"This grill cover seems pretty durable... I was so excited when I pulled it out of the box. I placed it on top of my grill to begin covering and there was a rip! It fits perfectly and is on the grill now, due to snow (We ordered the cover because we NEED one!). I would love this cover...except for that rip..."
2,Bad out of the Box,Just received this cover today and noticed a rip in it right out of the box. It appears the stitching was not very good and a rip about 2 inches long is at the top where sewn together. To much hassle to return so I patched it with some duck tape. This is a very thin material and not worth the price. I would not buy this again.
2,Falling apart at the seams.....,"Overall this product does what it is supposed to - covers the barbeque to keep the elements off. The downside is after four weeks of occasional use it is starting to come apart at the top seam, despite no heavy handling or snagging on anything. disappointing."
5,The Price Is Right,"Grill Cover fits perfectly with velcro tabs for end closures.Previous grill covers were not as well made and had to be held with ""Bungie Cords."""
4,Covers my grill well and has not failed. But...,"This is the right size. It is reasonable quality material. The velcro works well. There are lots of good things to say about this product.My only concern has a good and bad viewpoint. It's not as sturdy a material as the first cover I had. I don't expect anything to tear it; it's too strong for that. But it's not going to last forever. HOWEVER, my last cover didn't wear out, the weather ruined it over time. Standing out in all seasons, it eventually got too ugly to keep.So this one might last a little less time than my earlier one. It was also cheaper, so perhaps the sensible thing to do is buy a few of these and replace them every 5 years or so. Grills last a long time, longer if you always have them covered when not in use (and after they've cooled down)."
5,Fits my charbroil perfectly,"The cover seems to be thick and durable. Fits very snugly over the grill, but is easy to get it on and off."
5,Necessary item,This is a great item that protects the bar-b-que. Maybe the bar-b-que will last longer if it is not in the weather all the time
4,written review,"the cover does just what it is supposed to do. size wise it is a little ungainly, however it needs to be. on a scale of l to l0 i would give it an 8."
1,Doesn't work on Xbox games or in a laptop or with some data,"I bought these in hope that they would be the great thing that they are advertised to be. They weren't! First of all, when using them on an Xbox game, it GREATLY slows down the game, to the point that it is unplayable. When I tried to use these in my laptop, they were a no go! It wouldn't even read the disk and it sounded like my laptop was an airplane taking off due to my cd drive frantically trying to read the disk to no avail. On a desktop computer, it will read some data disks with the d-skin on it, but it's slow. You won't be watching an mpg or vcd movie with the d-skin on for instance. I don't know how well they work on a cd player with musical cd's, but anything else is definately out. Since I am an mp3 man, I have no need to play music cd's, so I haven't tried them. I wish these worked as promised, I REALLY do, it would be a dream. Perhaps someday this idea will be perfected and then I can give FIVE stars instead of ONE!"
5,Awesome,This is a great book that I couldn't put down!! A great author and highly recommend! Makes a great gift for your readers!
5,Vol. 1 of 11 on the analysis of Vatican II,"This volume shows you how ambiguity in the official texts of Vatican II opened the door for progressivist interpretations. And how Progressivism then installed itself in the Catholic Church. It is a carefully written, authoritative book about the Council and its aftermath. And has extensive footnotes and bibliography."
4,A true lost generation,"Scary in that it shows a Japan that doesn't have much substance any more. An even scarier (and better) film of similar intent, shot on a much lower budget, but done with much greater cinematic and narrative flare, is ""Love & Pop,"" which I give 5 stars. Both films are very entertaining, with no overt social preaching of any kind. Sometimes, just telling it how it is, is quite enough."
1,Bad Discs,"I don't know if anyone else encountered this problem but we tried two copies of this film from Amazon and another from Barnes & Noble and all were defective. At the same point in all the copies the DVD froze and would not advance. We had to eject the DVD, reload, do scene selection and then reverse to a point several minutes past the freeze point. The DVD would play from that point without another problem. We did try the disc in several differenct models of DVD players and they all froze at the same place. When looking at the disc you could see a mark like a bubble about where the film froze. I have tried contacting the studio but as it is in Tokyo I have had no luck. Good movie but we had to send them back."
2,no backbone,"Ok, if you just need a silicone case to protect your Cowon from scratching, this is a great choice. If you actually want to use the sports arm band, it's no good! the Cowon definitely needs a sturdier product because it is simply too big and heavy for this silicone case. The back of the case should have been reenforced so the Cowon doesn't bounce around when you run. Now it becomes uncomfortable to wear and I had to start using a belt clip."
4,Good - rather have a carrying case,"This protective skin is just that, a relatively thin silicone skin that protects your Cowon D2 from getting scratched or dinged. While it does what it's designed to do, I wish there were other options.... such as a padded carrying case that also has space for earphones, memory chips, etc. This protective skin is such a small, simple item that probably costs only a few cents to produce, I can't believe it's not included with the D2 in the first place. While a worthwhile bit of protection for your media player investment, it certainly costs way more than it should to have to buy it as a separate item.Bottom line, I wouldn't carry around the D2 without this protective skin, but I dislike having to buy it, and what it cost to buy it.Another good bit of protection is a generic trim-to-fit skin for the touch screen... available at most office supply stores."
1,Cheap air filter,"Bought this filter thinking it was made in America, since it's an ACDelco product, but when I opened the box the first thing I saw was 'made in china', not only was it flimsy but $5.00 more than the 'Denso' filter it replaced, which was made in Japan. I will never buy another ACDelco product. From now on only 'Denso' filters, they're better and cheaper."
3,Billion Better,I too LOVE the From the Inside Record...Alice a bit weak and out of breath refusing to sing a song.intersting to seeI like the billion dollar baby dvd good to see youI like to hear the talk about Alice.. it was fun to grow up the heals of such at 45yoI saw him 10years later flooring all those songsI just wish he sang like he did on the Alice Cooper Show Recordit is a bit sad to see him struggle as such but God Bless him for touringI do remember seeing this on TV blue jean network
1,Sooo Sorry .......,"I am so sorry I waisted our money on this, it came in good time but was not what I remeberd for so long ago, my fault. I will not buy Alice Cooper ever again."
3,For Completists,"This dvd is good to own if you are an Alice fan so you can finally get this show on dvd, and see what his show was like on this tour. But, the show is not great, and the band played the songs less heavy in the late 70's. Alice also doesn't sing great. Alice's newer dvds better for casual fans. The commentary is also not great. Alice doesn't say as much on here as he does on other dvds, and he repeats some of the things he says on the ""Welcome to My Nightmare"" concert. The film quality was good."
2,Wasabi,The Wasabi peas were purchased for my husband and daughter. I was hoping to find a less expensive product with the same taste as the W. peas purchased at Walmart. The price was a little (not much) more reasonable and the size larger than previously purchased. However both my husband and daughter were disappointed in the taste of the Wasabi peas.
1,Nokia recommending the WRONG adapter!,This adapter will NOT allow the use of 2.5mm headsets that do not function properly when directly connected to the E90 Communicator. This adapter is ONLY for TTY devices - contrarty to the accessory recommendations listed on Nokia's website.
5,Excellent,"I love this product! It gives me instant energy and it also seems to be helping in healing my digestive tract. And it tastes pretty good even when just mized with water. I just add some stevia to sweeten it up a bit. My husband mixes it with rice milk.I tried another vegan protein drink and it tore up my stomach.While this may not have the protein content of garbanzo beans as the other person said, I think more is assimilated because it is liquid. Also I cannot eat garbonzo beans due to a restrictive diet and I doubt very seriously that I would get this kind of energy boost from eating garbonza beans or that it would have the same healing properties.It is expensive for the amount you get, but to me it is worth it. I have had some health issues lately and the difference I feel when I drink it is enormous.Each person's system and needs is different. This product works for me."
1,Not a very good item...,"This product looks 3 times bigger in the picture than it is in reality... The foot stone is almost a miniture, and I ended up not using anything but the loofer... The basket isn't even worth using for anything else... It's only worth a couple of bucks..."
4,Beverly Sills Fans: BEWARE,"If you're a Bubbles fan buying this to hear your diva, please be advised that she doesn't sing on this recording of Mahler's 4th. The total length of her performance in the 2nd Symphony amounts to no more than 5 minutes out of the total length of just over 77 minutes. Those few minutes are lovely, though. Sills sounds absolutely ethereal as her voice hovers above the chorus and orchestra. Still, you'll be better off buying a recording of the 2nd symphony (minus the 4th)."
3,not exactly what I exspected,I bought this tool not to use as a hot knife to help me with large cuts out of books for my altered book projects. It definatly does cut a lot faster than a standard Xacto knife. the tool gets very hot which is good but it also makes me nervous at how hot it gets. You have to use alot of caution when using this tool. It is certainly a tool for adults. the other thing is the blade; when tighening the blade into the tool if the blade is too far down it wont tighen enough on the tool at will come loose with use ( I had this happen and the blade piece fell off while i was using it and burned a small hole in the rug. YIKES! I had to run to the kitchen to get an oven mit to pick it up and get it to the sink where it could cool safely.) If you are going to buy this tool it works well but be careful when using the hot knife.
5,Did the job.,I purchased this product primarily for the hot knife. I needed to seal the edges on some synthetic fabric and the hot knife did the job.
3,Hot knife?,"If your doing simple soldering it's ok... If you're thinking of using it for hot cutting fabric (rip-stop nylon or poly, etc.,) forget it! The knife tip never gets hot enough."
4,Works well...does its job,I don't have any complaints about the product. I've had much luck with it thus far.
1,"Two words: DON""T BUY","It's sad when we have come to a time when once reputable companies sell such substandard products. The review that said junk was being nice. The tip does not screw in far enough to secure to the iron. I worked around this by grinding some of the barrel so the tip would screw in further. This worked until the barrel split in half. We live in an age of a disposable society. Companies exist by making inferior products, and when they fail we just toss them and move on. Skip this product, the land fills are full enough."
3,xacto soldering,"it's your basic soldering iron w/ a twist. the tip it comes w/ is a XACTO knife. good, yes? the bad, it seems that the tip doesn't seat so well on the iron and either it's that or it's the XACTO knife itself, but it does NOT heat up so well. Sure, the tip is super sharp since it is a XACTO tip, but it doesn't heat up as a soldering tip should. but it should be good enough for wax projects and other similar uses. maybe ok for cheap soft plastics like model kits, etc."
3,if only i had the patience,it takes pretty long to heat up.pretty frackin long.the blade that comes with it is VERY VERY fragile. while i was cutting through a rubber bushing all of a sudden it breaks off and pieces go flying. i got a pretty nasty burn on my arm.the second time it took so long that something possessed me to leave the room for a minute and grab a glass of orange juice as i waited for it to heat up.and...i sort of forgot about it...a week later i find it still plugged in and cold as ice.whoops. it melted itself.
3,Ok as a mixer if don't consider effects.,It is good to use as audio mixer and sound quality is ok but it's effect is not really working well.It has only reverb effect and there is no echo or other effects.
4,Great litter but the scent is overpowering!,I started buying this at Costco because they have such a great deal (30# for under $10). I agree with the previous review: works great but I can't stand the smell of the litter on the cat's paws afterwards... so strong I can taste it! Luckily they have an unscented version but it's hard to find sometimes and Costco doesn't carry it :(
1,Scoop away - now permanently away,"I've owned cats for 20 years now. I recently got a new cat, and tried Scoop Away (scented) and noticed the changes with my cat immediately. Since using this product, she was washing herself constantly, and vomited several times in the vicinity of the litter box.As well, we have good noses -- and noticed the dusty smell 2 floors up from the litter box. Just now, I noticed the cat breathing more heavily, like she has a sinus infection.This is a nasty, BAD product. Air quality reviews should be done showing how toxic the particulate matter is from this product. Don't forget that these small particles carry feces, urine and other toxic microbes into your ventilation system!"
1,New packaging is terrible,"I've been a long time fan of this litter, but now that they have changed the packaging to cardboard boxes with small handles, I will look for another brand. Frankly, I can't lift the package without hurting my back and neck! With the previous plastic tubs, the large thicker handle meant that you could lift the heavy tub with two hands, spreading out the load. The new packaging guarantees injury to customers. When you produce a very heavy product it is imperative that you protect the user who has to carry it."
3,"The litter works great, but the perfume stench is overpowering.",This product works great for clumping and controlling litterbox smells. However the perfume used is way too potent. I have bought this a few times from [...] in the past and it is a great litter. It clumps very well. The problem arises however that the perfume sets me off on sneezing fits. One of these days I will try the unscented version and see how that works.
2,Doesn't Super Clump for us,"We have two cats that despite their small builds are big poopers with strong smell to it. This litter simply didn't perform well enough for our situation. We did not find it to be ""super clumping"". Our cats' fur would actually stink because they'd get a fine dusting of this litter after going in the litter box and that fine dust would stink because it wasn't clumping around and containing the odors of the #1 and #2 in the box. Onward to another brand in our search!"
1,"Allergy sufferers, be wary.","Pros: Clumps well, fairly economicalCons: This product is EXTREMELY dusty. It is heavily scented with perfume that literally makes me choke while scooping the catbox. I had to start wearing masks to scoop the catbox or risk sneezing and runny eyes for 20 minutes or so, and it left my cats with a very unpleasant smell. The dust is everywhere, and even though I've now switched cat litter brands, you can still smell it when I dust the house. It's ridiculous, it was even inside my computer when I opened it up to clean it out."
1,Coughing Fits,The first time I dumped this litter into the litter box my whole apartment filled with dust--it looked like fog. I can still smell it even though I threw it out. The morning after I had filled the litterbox with it both my cat and I were wheezing. And this was the perfume free variety.
1,"Buy a Phil Ochs CD, don't waste your money on this.","The title of this cd should be ""How to waste $30.98"". It seems that all the artists on this cd decided to slow down the tempo on all the songs to make them sound as dreary as possible. I would describe the singing as labored. Like they are trying to squeese more meaning out of the song than it has. I've been listening to Phil Ochs music for 40 years and was very disapointed with this collection. If you want to here the music of Phil Ochs, buy a Phil Ochs CD."
5,Ochs but not Ochs,"The price is a little steep, but this CD set is an excellent sampling of Phil Ochs' songwriting, with a few stylistic twists. Most of the artists capture the Ochsian method of singing songs with a passionate humility, where the message of each song is more important than its musical sheen.Hearing Katy Moffat sing ""Here's to the State of Mississippi"" with her Southern twang is beautiful on so many levels."
2,eh. eh.,"Phil Ochs is one of my favorites, but this ""tribute"" has a slightly musty odor. Why didn't they get more relevant musicians to perform on this? Instead they get lots of old and not so old folk musicians to give most faithful renditions of his songs. But why not include contemporary ""protest"" musicians? The tradition that Ochs was a part of no longer exists as it did within the confines of acoustic guitars. It exists in hip hop and it exists in bands like Rage Against the Machine. I'm not a huge fan of bands like RAGE, but why weren't they approached for this? Hell, aside from superficial musical similarities, Phil Ochs has much more in common with Rage then he does with James Taylor.To show that Ochs's music is relevant today (and I firmly believe it is), they should have approach an eclectic assortment of politically engaged and committed artists. Instead, this only reinforces the idea that this kind of music is for upper middle class, middle aged white people."
5,Business by THE BOOK,My husband is reading this and says it's the best book he's read on the topic! Gives real world advice on how to apply God's Word to the world of business today.
5,Balanced and powerful,I was deeply impressed with the balanced approach Larry Burkett has for doing business from a Biblical worldview. I am purchasing copies as gifts.
2,Ok from a man who lived in Africa.,"First of all this movie reminds me of the time when I was in South Africa. It is similar in a way but it would have been more intresting and better if the actors and actresses were speaking Afrikans, Zulu, Xhosa in most part of the movie. They should of also had actors or so called actors acting as Boeras. Then it would of got a five star rating from me. Only one song in Zulu what was the director thinking?"
3,YOUR AVERAGE ACTION MOVIE,"A YOUNG SOUTH AFRICAN [ICE CUBE] WHO IMMIGRATED TO AMERICA YEARS AGO, RETURNS TO SOUTH AFRICA TO BURY HIS FATHER. WHILE HE'S THERE, HE FINDS OUT THAT HIS DRUG ADDICTED BROTHER IS IN BIG TROUBLE WITH AN ORGANIZED CRIME SYNDICATE, WHICH ALSO SPELLS TROUBLE FOR HIM. OF COURSE, VING RHAMES IS INTRIGIUING AS THE VILLAIN, BUT EVERYONE ELSE ACTS PRETTY LAZY IN THIS MOVIE. HAS SOME GOOD ACTION SEQUENCES. I GUESS IT'S WORTH A WATCH. BUT, YOU MIGHT NEED TO RENT THIS BEFORE YOU THINK ABOUT BUYING IT."
4,Exellant!,This is one of the best movies made by Ice Cube and Elizabeth Hurley.They make a great team together.This movie is a must see its really really good!
3,ELIZABETH HURLEY 3 Stars,Even elizabeth hurley could not save this movie i have given her the 3 stars to this movie she looks 100% sexy as always a must $buy$ for all elizabeth hurley fans i own this just for her if you would want to watch it just for Liz BUY it. but if you just want to watch it because your looking for an action movie DONT.
3,Frame problem,"This is a very pretty headboard and footboard. The directions, however, in putting it together where not very good and when completed, there is a 3-4"" space between the footboard and the mattress when the mattress is properly placed at the head of the bed as the bed frame itself is entirely too long and not adjustable. I called the company about this asking if there was a different frame they could send, but was told no. I ended up having to have someone cut and rebolt the frame to get rid of the extra space as it looked pretty funky."
2,Fooled Again,Amazon.com needs to find out why this movie is not Hal Hartley's film like it seems to be advertised since other Hal Hartley films are mentioned below the product details...I was fooled just like the other guy. It's Amazon's fault not the sellers
1,(((((((NOT HAL HARTLY'S film TRUST!!!!!!))))))),"I wish that I had read the reviews below before I'd purchased this title, as it is NOT the version produced by filmmaker Hal Hartly. I agree that the Amazon posting makes it appear to be the associated with Hartly and they really should make a note, or figure out how to correct this mistake.Very disappointed!"
1,Best of Johnny Tillotson,"Songs dont match. What you have listed on your web site are not the same songs on the cd. The main song I bought the cd for, and is listed on your website (Why do I love you so) is nowhere to be found on the cd. The first 5 songs shown on your website on the cd are (1). Poetry in motion (2) Judy judy judy (3)Jimmy's girl (4)Dreamy Eyes and (5)Why do I love you so. The first 5 songs on the actual cd I received are (1)Tears on my pillow (2)Just one time (3)Things (4)Countin my teardrops and (5) Oh lonesome me..... Very very disapointed.... no return label or address to return.... No phone number to call to explain problem......"
5,Halloween,This is hands down our favorite Halloween book. We read and read our first copy until all the pages fell out! So we ordered another one.
2,By the light of the Halloween Moon,Did not care for the book. Was not appealing to me. Thought it would be fun to read to my grandaughter.
5,This is a beautiful book..,"..and not only beautiful but very useful as well. I've yet to find another one about linens so well written and packed with information. I'd like to learn more about fabrics, but the books I've purchased after this has been pretty disappointing because very little they mentioned is not in this book.The Book of Fine Linen covers a wide selection of fabrics made of linen, cotton, silk. And emelishments: weaving, embroidery, print. The author explaines how these fabrics had been used throughout history and how they evolved.The picures and paintings in the book are very relevant illustration of the text, but they are also a visual feast to the eye, they are gorgeous. It is a delight just to flip through the book and it would be great on the coffee table or as a gift."
4,Very Good,I would have given it 5 stars if it were all preserving..not refrigeration. I used to can large quantities but now that I am alone this is a wonderful book.
2,No Southerners,This book is not for anyone living in the Southern US. The authors are from Canada and many of the fruit listed for the recipes is not readily available in the South. And maybe the fruit is different in the North but I tried 3 of the jam recipes in the book and none of them 'jelled'. Would not buy this book again.
3,"fun, but not exactly practical",I purchased this book with the idea that I'd find inspiration to use the items in my garden. Not so sure that the small batch items would be practical.
3,Preserving for One!,"I purchased this book to obtain some recipes for things like Italian sauces that didn't require 30 lbs. of tomatoes which this book has. I succeeded in making 2 qts. of sauce with one of the recipes. However, most of the recipes are so small that they could barely satisfy one person. While one could double the recipe, you aren't technically supposed to mix doubled recipes together because it could affect the acidity so you would actually have to can the 2 batches separately. Getting 2 or 3 cups out of a recipe seems pointless. I was hoping for recipes that would allow you to put up at least 4 half-pints/pints. Many of the recipes aren't even for canning but for refrigeration or freezing. I do have to say though that the book does have some recipes that you won't find anywhere else which makes it somewhat worthwhile to have."
3,its very small batches,Great book for very small batches. 2 - 4 pints. Great recipes. I enjoy it. Just double the recipes for more I guess. Overall a good.purchase
4,very pleased,received the book in excellent timing and the book is as good as new. very pleased with this purchase.
4,In fairness to the author,"I am astonished by how many people see the word 'preserving' and automatically replace it with 'canning'. There is no author deception here, but there seems to be a number of people in need of dictionaries. Refrigeration, freezing, drying, and canning are all methods of preservation. It's extremely unjust to give this book a bad review based on the erroneous assumption that it is only about canning. The title states EXACTLY what the book is about. The very nature of 'small batch' preserving lends itself to preservation by refrigeration, so why be offended the author included such recipes? And, while I am on this rant, let me say that it is also wrong and a blatant disservice to the community to give a bad review based on trying a single recipe. If you haven't given a product a fair trial, honesty precludes writing a review of it."
2,Not a real Preserving book,"I thought this might be good book for preserving the rewards of my small garden. This is not a book for your ""average"" preserves. If you like to experiment with unusual ingredients, you might like this book. However, if you want to put up regular pickles, relishes and preserves, this is not the book for you. I was really disappointed. My copy is going to Goodwill."
1,Untested Canning Book?,"As near as I can tell, this is a completely untested canning book. I can frequently with great success, and have never had the problems with other recipes that I have had with every recipe I have tried out of this book.I tried the Jalapeno Mint Jelly TWICE, and both times, it failed to set for me.I also tried the Thyme Lemon and Black Peppercorn oil, which tasted like straight olive oil - I even tried heating it for longer when it had no thyme/lemon/pepper taste after the initial cooking time, and it still tasted like straight oil.After much money and time wasted, I gave the book one more try with an infused vinegar recipe. By following the recipe EXACTLY, against my gut instincts, I manage to create a lovely, sludge-filled vinegar that smells moldy.I am very sad, because the pictures in this book are great and the idea is fantastic, but this book is going straight in the garbage."
2,Not happy,"I throught i had brought a NEW book instead along edges is dirty, a tag torn off the front of book,this was suppose to be a Christmas Gift now looks like i will have to go buy a new book :("
3,A tasty letdown...,I was very excited about this book. I live alone and most canning recipes are for a small army. I haven't tried and of the recipes but as an experienced cook I know they will taste good. My big let down is the lack of blackberry recipes! They aren't included in any recipe or in the reading but they are in the cover photo. I feel that this is a bit deceptive. Overall the other recipes look delicious but the total disregard of one of the fruits from the cover is at best disappointing.
1,The Complete Book of Small-Batch Preserving,"This book is too old fashion. I was hoping for some new information. I was very disappointed in the recipes, nothing new. I was hoping to find some recipes that didn't include boiling to seal the jars...On a scale from 1-10 with 10 being the best, I would rate this book with a No. 1....It just wasn't worth buying in my opinion....Only a hand-ful of photos...."
2,"Not 300 recipes for ""preserving""!","I was disappointed to find that many recipes in this book are not for preserving at all -- one whole chapter was for items that must be stored in the refrigerator and used within a few weeks (some a lot less, such as 1 day! How is that preserving??). They might be good recipes, but that's not what I was looking for in purchasing the book. The recipes that really are for canning (or other means of preservation) look fine, but not much different than you find in other books. This would probably make more sense as a regular cookbook with a few chapters devoted to preserving. If you're looking for a lot of recipes for preserving, buy something else."
4,"Wow, this is totally groovy","I just viewed this, the people dancing and the unconventional camera work along with the charming vintage feel. It's a keeper."
2,Junk Mail,"I ordered ""Playboy After Dark"", a television show from the sixties. Right after that I started receiving pornographicadvertisements in the mail. It appeared someone sold my address to a porn distributor. I called the company tostop the junk mail and the operator told me they had a affiliation with Amazon. As for the DVD I enjoyed seeingall the old actors and musicians from he sixties. But I was not happy about having my home address sold to apornographic company."
3,A frustrating miss,"Janet Baker was as famous for her Das Lied role as Ferrier a generatoin before her, and for years I waited with bated breath for someone to record her. When the time finally came it was too late--she sounds mature and tired, overtaxed by this very difficult part. James King is burlier than he was on Bernswtein's recording for Decca, a faded hero without much sensitivity to the poetry. And Haitink oddly misfires with his conducting, missing the poignancy and depth of emotion Mahler worte into the score.Luckily, at this late date a live performance of Das Lied with Janet Baker in excellent voice has surfaced under Kubelik's direction--that's the reocrding to get if you want this marvelous mezzo in her prime (1872 as opposed to 1979, I believe)."
5,This would be a GREAT movie!,"After reading this book, I would love to see it as a movie, where it would reach millions. It is so thought-provoking, and so well written that I recommend it to anyone who loves a great book that's hard to put down. The character is as complex as the storyline and has an unexpected but great ending. I cried through many parts but at the end my tears were of sadness and joy. Don't miss this one!"
2,Skims the Surface,I felt the book touched on the basics but never really gave me anything to start my own business. Many of the pages were filled with large photograhphs instead of in-depth knowledge. I was hoping for a book that would tell it all so that I could go out and begin a faux painting business...with confidence. Not impressed.
1,Faux For Dough,"I thought the book was definitely not geared for a professional faux finisher. It was way too general in nature to really help someone start a faux finishing business. It needs more specific information on business aspects. Most of the information given in the book was just common sense & did not warrant the purchase of this book. There are other books on the market that do a much better job of giving one the in depth information needed to start their own painting business. This book was, sadly, a big disappointment."
2,Incomplete..........,"Roy Budd did the soundtrack to ""The Final Option"" a great film with great music, why does it not appear on these 'best of' CD's??"
2,VENGEANCE 2007 DOSEN'T LIVE UP,"There is really nothing much to talk about Vengeance 2007. all the titles reatined expect the women's championship.3average event,"
5,What a difference!,"My husband recently read this book and I can not believe how it has changed him. He really is ""showing the man."" I was so interested in the new him I read it for myself. It gave me a great deal of insight into the things he and other men struggle with. I feel like I really understand him now."
5,Over the Edge: Journeying Together to Recapture the Heart an,"Every man strives to reach his potential and accomplish success in life. This book provides a tool to work toward achieving this potential in a relevant way. As a pastor, I am always looking for ways to encourage others and this book is a great resource for me to pass on."
5,WOW!!!!!!,"WOW THIS CD BLEW ME AWAY!!!!! MISS 2-4-K ALL THE WAY, BUT WHERE SHE AT? THIS CD IS AMAZING."
5,Pretty Perfect Album,"I am a huge Manilow and Carpenters fan and I noticed Randy had written tunes for both back in the day. Let's cut to the chase--the guy knows how to write hooky, melodic pop tunes, some of the best ever. His version of ""Concrete And Clay"" is worth it alone, but ""Blue Street,"" ""Highway Affair,"" ""Uptown Uptempo Woman""...there really isn't a weak song in the group. The version of ""Weekend in New England"" may not float your boat if you're used to Manilow, but it's the original, so it's worth a listen or several to be sure. If you ever find yourself wishing music was once again the way it was in the piano-based portion of the 70's, you owe it to yourself to get this CD."
5,Way to go Umi!,"The third volume centers on Umi, the water Magic Knight. She is reluctant, but shows determination when her friends are in trouble. Big mallets come in handy for the mysterious Mokona. It builds suspense for the last two volumes of this majorly steller anime!"
3,"Exciting plot, less than perfect characters","As a follower of the SG-5 Saga, I really expected more of this book. Although the plot is excellent, the characters lack punch. There is too much baggage in both Jillian and Jack, and although the length of the book gives the author time to work the nicks between them, the plot focuses more on the trek than on their relationship.All in all, it left me with a weird feeling of unfinish."
5,One of the most amazing women I have read about,"From the moment Arlene Blum begins to tell her story, I was hooked. She does an exceptional job of structuring the memoir so you understand who she is as a person... and how she became an adventurer. Nothing stops her as a young child or an adult for breaking new ground for women and for her spirit. I was enthralled. Marcia"
2,A Boring Old Turkey!,"What a lame, unfunny but silly turkey this one is! It gets long and tedious afteryou seee that it's not going to get any better, let me tell you!The writing was very weak, I thought. One dud of a skit after another!I'll never watch that one again! Yuk!"
5,Gaia's Plantain Goldenseal Ointment,This is a truly fine ointment. I have used it for years. For any small to medium sore or break in the skin this ointment is almost miraculous for the way it speeds up healing. It is superior to any other ointment I have ever used...and vastly superior to the antibiotic ointments you will find in the drug stores.
2,Might be good if it worked,"Must be used on specific HP machines, I couldn't get it to work. Very disappointed in this product, this type of product should be able to be used on any desktop or laptop system."
4,Works like a charm,Got this for my HP laptop. It has the same reader in the laptop but I didnt like having to open the laptop while docked just to swipe my finger. So this plugged into my usb keyboard and works well.My only negative comment is that these swipe type devices dont work as well as the Microsoft fingerprint reader but thats true of all the swipe devices I have used. This works as good as the one in the HP Laptop and you dont have to install the new software that comes with this if you have an HP with the Credential manager software. It works with the existing HP Credential manager on HP laptops with no changes.Would recommend if you have a docking station.
4,Good Instructional Video,"For any guitar player, this is about as close to having a teacher in the room with you without actually having one. The video shows you how to play several songs from start to finish, explains how to play the chords in the songs and optional fingering for some of the chords."
5,Judgment Day will rock,"This ppv will be for the 3 brands and this might be the card:1.WORL HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP Undertaker v Batista (3 stages of hell) TLC, Hell in a cell, Buried alive. 10/10R.I.P Batista2.

2,Judgment Day 2007 Dissappoints,This years's Judgment Day Was As Disappoinitng. Even when it had all the 3 brands but still didn't live up to the ecpectations.Ric flair def.carlito. Flair made carlito tap out after giving a figure four leg lock.CM pank def. that black guy. Punk when after giving his finishing move.Lashley def. mcmahons n umaga. Lashley pinned shane after giving a slam. But vince had a story to say that he didn't pin him so that he is still the ecw world champion.Hardz def. cade n murdock. Jeff pinned murdock after giving swanton bomb.hardyz retained the world tag team championship.Randy orton n Hbk Fought in a no contest. reason hbk collapsed after suffering an injury.Edge Def Batista. Edge won by giving a school boy to batista and retained his world heavyweight championship.John cena def the great khali. Cena made khali tap after giving an STFU and retained his WWE championship.Overall An Average PPV At Best.
5,Tap for beginners,This is the best DVD for beginner tap. It's easy to understand and follow. The best price on Amazon too!!
4,Like it,"This is a great product for beginners. The split screen that shows 2 angles of the instructors feet is helpful, as are the counts displayed on the bottom of the screen. The video starts very basic, but then moves into combining steps for fun combinations. Once you have the basics down, you can easily jump to the more advanced steps with the menu. This is the first workout/dance video that I have purchased, that I have actually used more than once."
5,Excellent - just what I needed,This is exactly what I needed to support my occasional 1:1 lessons with my teacher. It would also be a good start on it's own for soemone not having phyiscal lessons.Good quality and the instructor is very clear and patient!I've just ordered the next volume
3,Tap 1,"Overall the lessons, except for the flaps section, is good. The quality of the menu and the ability to maneuver within the lessons is poor and at times impossible."
3,Good,This is a nice video and gives you an idea of the standard steps and components needed to begin tap dancing...
5,dance,"like like llike kids love it. this is a good buy an great video, the kids are still dancing. great"
5,Bravo!,"The DVD's have arrived today, and I immediately started to make good use of them! and I am finding Eli's instruction to be of excellent quality, and so very helpful. I recently joined a class for which instruction had started in September, so I have some catching up to do, and I know with Eli's help, I will be able to achieve that! His teaching is very precise and understandable, and very friendly. Thank you soooo much Eli. I will tell those in my class who are struggling to be sure to place their orders! :-) Teresa - Alexandria, VA"
1,Almost boring,He wants to explain easily. But he repeats and repeats and repeats. It's not recessary. It's dvd. The user has the possibility to go back and review it.It's not much that he takes on this dvd.
2,the dead novel (maybe),"To call 'The Dead Father' a novel is a bit of stretch. It's more of a musing, a strange dream. What there is of a story here lacks focus. It's interesting for a bit, but grows tiresome. Perhaps the book's best part is a book within the book called 'The Manual for Sons', in which a number if differing father types are presented for satirical scrutiny: it's not a pretty picture; but it is entertaining.The praise this novel receives is most likely attributed to its 'differentness', and given the time it was published, in the mid '70s, when there were plenty of calls for the death of the novel and such, and the continued march of post-modern games masquerading as novels, it's not surprising that the 'lit-heads' of the time were fascinated by this one. So if you like that sort of thing, this is for you. Otherwise try out Barthelme's short fiction first; it's far more rewarding - his true metier."
3,strange and sometimes funny - what I remember!,"I have mixed feelings about Barthelme, and this book mixes them up even more. Very funny scenes and sentences but it's impossible to follow what's happening, and when it's over (I just finished reading it last night) I forget almost completely what happened in it. (This guy is carrying his dead father around and they're talking to each other while encountering various adventures.I preferred Paradise, which is very funny and sad. Guy who can't deal with all the women in his life who are always telling him what's wrong with him. Remember that one!"
4,Barthelme's Slim spectacular,"Barthelme employs all the tools of post-modernism to discuss progression and how the past clings to us, influences us even if we try to ignore it. A fable that covers literature, family, politics, gender roles, etc. If you can get through the more difficult parts, it comes together at the end. Not necessarily recommended for the beginning reader, but mostly for literature heads looking to see what happens after Beckett."
2,"Lackluster, Detached Novel",This novel is hard to read. It does not keep interest. The characters seems a remote from each other as the author seems from the reader. The style is James Joyce without the intellect and Monte Python without the wit. Save your time and skip this one.
1,Bad scale,"Purchased from an instructor in a class I took. Did not work out of the box. Called the company-returned the scale. After paying for shipping, insurance, they refused to accept the scale. Called again--they described a process different from what was on the warranty. Considering it would cost me another $15 to send it across the country, I opted out of the worthless piece of junk. There was no sorrow on their part. I noticed when I unpacked the box to throw the scale away that there were pistachio shells in the box. I did not have them there when I sent it and it appears that they opened the box, read the letter and invoice, ate some nuts and returned the scale and the nut shells to me--figure that out. Don't buy one."
1,"horrible scale, not lifetime warranty","AVOID THIS SCALE AT ALL COSTS! The lifetime warranty is a lie! The scale worked for me at first but then stopped working and only showed ""0.00"" no matter what I tried! Please, save your money and invest in something worth the money."
1,Hunk of Junk,"Worked for about 5 months then stopped - as others mentioned here: I replaced batteries, used an AC Adapter all to no avail. It comes with a ""Lifetime Warranty"" of course the seller I bought it from ebay doesn't sell there anymore and I came on here and see that even people who can still contact their seller aren't having much luck. Suck it up and spend more from the get go as I should have done."
1,Frustrated Customer,"Ugh! I bought this scale for my home-based business only to have it break after one time of use. The thing doesn't even turn on. I tried changing the batteries, plugging it into a different outlet--nothing. So, I called the company and spoke to a very nice sales rep. They sent me another scale to replace my defunct order. But, IT DOES NOT WORK EITHER!!!!!! The company knows that a percentage of these scales do not work at all due to some internal problem. THIS PRODUCT SHOULD NOT BE ON THE MARKET!!!! It is a waste of money. I am still trying to get my refund from the company and am now getting the run around.Spend the extra money to get a scale that works.... in this case you certainly will get what you pay for. A cheap piece of junk!"
1,Scale only worked for 1 day,"I received this scale and used it to weigh about 4 light packages (2-3 pounds each). It seemed to work just fine. Turned it off, went to bed, tried to turn it on in the morning and couldn't get it to turn back on. I tried plugging/unplugging it, putting the battery in/out... nothing.Suffice it to say - I'm not impressed. This scale also just felt 'flimsy' to me, so I simply chose to return it. After about $15 in total shipping costs to me and back, this $20 scale isn't feeling like such a deal anymore. I'll buy a different one next time.FYI - the seller seemed fine about generating an RMA # for my return; so I am not taking issue with them at this point - just with the low-end, broken scale."
1,absolute junk,I have a small home business and purchased this to help me reduce trips to the post office.It worked exactly one week and then quit!! do not buy this piece of junk.
5,WeighMax Postal Scale,The measurements I take with this scale have matched everytime with that taken by the postal service. Can't beat that!
2,Stay clear.,Stopped working after one day. Return policy is a hassle and has to be returned to a different vendor. My first one had a lifetime warranty but the one returned to me has a 10 year. It's really just a POS.
2,Great item but then it died a few months later,I bought this because I did alot of shipping. I loved it because it gave exact weights. Unfortunately after only a couple of months it started messing up and finally died. It was quite costly and probably would not buy again since it broke.
5,Weighmax Postal Scale,"The Weighmax digital Postal scale was delivered quickly, and was in perfect condition. It works exactly as advertised, and I am very pleased with the quality of the product."
4,Good little scale,"I bought this scale to replace another scale that we had, it has a smaller plate platform about 7"" square, it works great and I would recommend it."
1,Be careful about the adapter,"Like another one of the reviews, I too used the AC adapter; I was able to successfully weigh one item, then turned the scale off. The very next day, the thing wouldn't even turn on, even though I hadn't even touched the thing since. The battery didn't work either."
2,False start,The manufacturer knowlingly sent out a scale that they knew would not work! When I called to complain they said that they knew these machines would not work and if I returned a battery cord-as proof of purchase they would send a replacement machine.I have it now-but too soon to see if it is working as advertised.Bob
1,Piece of Junk...Buy One from Your Local Post Office,"I got this piece of Junk today and it turned on...but it didn't weigh anything!!!It stayed on zero and I at first thought ""Well, maybe I should take the battery out and put it back in."" I did that five times then tried the cord too five times. Still it wouldn't weigh anything.I suggest NOT buying this or any scales off the internet. Instead go to Office Max, Staples or even your local post office. ...At least you'll be able to return it much quicker AND get a quality product if it DOES work.Also most of the positive reviews are probably fake. I never buy a product if it has only positive reviews...that's why I bought this."
2,dead,Sorry to say that I love the scales but it doesn't sevive the post office. With all the tossing around they do I have had two scales and niether one of them made it to me in working condition. If I could get it locally it would be a great product.Kathy
2,bad touch buttons,"Just purchased this scale, and, while I like the size and some of the features, the on/off and mode buttons are poorly placed, and don't always work. I've been playing with it today, and I seem to have to spend way too much time pressing those buttons to get anything to happen. Don't know if this is a flaw in this one machine, or if it's a problem with them all. In any case, I'm thinking of sending it back."
2,Extremely touchy!,"This scale works but it is very sensitive. You can not have the batteries in while using the AC adapter but the instructions don't tell you this. I was about to return it but then I took the batteries out and it worked. You must put your item on gently and do NOT touch it while the scale is determining the weight. Ok for the money but I wish I had read a review first so I would have known, I would have spent a few more dollars and bought something a little more sturdy."
5,Great Scale Good Price!,"This is a good scale for the price, i ship boxes alot and works great. Have paid more for scales that i do not use any more because i like this one best."
1,Lasted a year,"I bought a Weighmax on ebay in February 2008. As of summer 2009 it's not working -- nothing happens when I try to turn it on, whether on battery or plugged in. From the look and feel of the product it seems a little cheap and the company sounds pretty marginal judging from the customer's experience with their service department. It's made in China, not that I think that's automatically bad but it's not inherently a harbinger of quality either. Unfortunately I can't find the product info, can't locate contact info for Weighmax and probably it's not under warranty anyway. So I would not recommend Weighmax products -- let's be honest, the main selling point is that they're cheaper, and now we know there's a reason for that."
1,Poor Service,"I did not receive my a/c adaptor with my order. I have emailed twice. The second time I received a response. I have yet to receive my adaptor. I am not happy. It was the deciding factor in choosing this scale. The scale is fine, it's the service that needs help."
3,5gram accuracy,"5 gram accuracy is only good for mailing. But I could not scale many other items requiring higher accuracy. Therefore, I have to buy another scale with higher accuracy."
4,read review,"Scale looks great and has few , if any, faults. First one I rec'd didn't work at all. BUT, upon contacting Co. in California, I was treated with complete caring and had a NEW unit sent to me immediately. This is how more business should treat there customers. A GREAT example!!!"
5,bites,"I am 72 years old and have serious knee problems. No cartilege, bone spurs and a calcium deposit. Very painful. My podiatrist reccommended Bites. As they are no longer made I was lucky to find some through Amazon. They are outstanding. Physical therapy helps more than anything else. The Bites are 2nd in line. I am improving trememndously from both. The shoes make walking so much easier. I wish they still made them. However Crocs bought them out and stopped making them. Now if I could get Crocs to change their minds and make the ones podiatrists like and are really helpful. I will never buy another pair of crocs."
4,First Hand Account of the Air War in Europe,"Written by Captain John McCrary and David E. Scherman in 1944. Captain John R. (Tex) McCrary who joined the Army Air Force in 1941 and served initially as a Public Relations Officer and then as a Photographic Officer with the Eight Army Air Force. David Scherman was a Life Magazine photographer since 1938 and assigned to England during the War years shot the majority of pictures included. Many of the stories taken directtly from the crew members. Great reading that puts the reader in England during the War with different elements of the Eight Air Force. The book has over 240 pages of which more than 110 are black and white pictures of war scenes depicting the men, planes, and life of the US Airmen of the Eight Air Force. As someone that lost a relative with the Eight Air Force while fighting over Europe it provides the reader with a window in time of life for the servicemen during the Air War."
5,Cerebral Ischemia: Mechanisms in Pathology,"This is a fantastic book ca: 1994, printed 1996, which is still relevant for scientists in the year 2005. The book covers the minute details of cerebral ischemia mechanisms discussing glutamate excitotoxicity, calcium, IEG, c-fos, c-jun, hypothermia, LTP, LTD, spreading depression, steroids, free radicals and scavengers, ZN-SOD, NO and NO Synthase, and many other topics. There are over 50 chapters, making this a comprehensive coverage. The material is dated so that one must not rely on this book for everything. Wolfgang Walz wrote a more recent volume entitled Cerebral Ischemia by Humana which is worth looking at. Bo Siesjo and T. Wieloch are the editors so you know it is going to be good with excellent commentaries at the end of each chapter & section. Bo apparently moved from Lund so that contacting him could be difficult."
1,terrible sound quality & uncomfortable,"The pad on the earpiece is comfortable, but the fit is tight on the head, and I have a narrow head.Worse than that, the person at the other end sounds muffled, as if they're speaking into a pillow. Without the headset connected they sound fine, loud and clear; connected, low and muffled even with the volume all the way up. The other person had no trouble hearing me.I am going to return it and buy another PanasonicPanasonic KX-TCA60 Hands-Free Headset with Comfort Fit Headband. $8.96. I've gone through 2 sets so far. Decent sound. The first set lasted about 2 years, then the head band snapped. The second lasted about 6 months before it suddenly conked out, but I was hard on it. I read that twisting the microphone around a lot can cause tiny wires to break, so this time I will be careful."
5,Wolf,"This story is a great way to set the stage for the new school year. My students listened eagerly and found the story amusing, especially because the wolf wanted to be educated. The story was a good stepping stone for literacy activities."
1,Totally unreliable monitor,"I got 2 of these monitors to go with my new HP workstation. It's been less than 3 weeks and I'm ready to call customer service AGAIN to have a 3rd one replaced. The 1st one worked for less than an hour before developing white flickering streaks. The second one turned purple with vertical streaks in less than a week. Now, 2 weeks later one of the replacements is now flickering orange with green stripes. I have been a professional purchaser of computer equipment for over 10 years and I've never seen a failure rate like this. I am totally disgusted with HP, their manufacturing standards and their customer service."
4,Really cool,"Not bad! I bought this one unheard, and I am glad I did. Surprising production, really good singing, GREAT songwriting. Not bad!"
3,WANT DVD!!,I loved this cartoon as a kid!!! PLEASE produce the DVD for us! That's why I gave 3 stars and not 5--want the DVD :)
3,Upgrade,This needs to be on DVD. I would even buy a blue ray player if that is what it takes to get this series on 21st century viewing.
2,arco sergeant Lt Cap.,This was a 20 year old book passed off online. out of date and no where near current for todays testing standards. I found a much more current one at less than half the price that matched my needs much better.
3,Nothing special,"Size was as expected....doesn't stay cold any longer than other brands like Coleman, so not sure why the price is so high. Based on some of the reviews I was expecting more. Maybe it's the lunch cooler that's to blame."
2,Blue Ice Blues,Very disappointed. I bought 4 of them and sorry I did. A baggie full of ice would do a better job.
4,perfect for six pack Small cooler,This small cooler block works great in conjunction with the six-pack cooler block in our small cooler. we put in our cans then the six-pack block then this Block on top to help keep the well needed cool ones for softball cold.
4,Great product - watch out for leaks.,"Holds the cold up to 4HRS w/o a cooler. Compact, durable. I've bought two of these and one of them had a significant leak on arrival. I've put a little bit of hermetic around the plug which seems to take care of the problem. Will buy more as needed."
1,buyer beware,amazon says there are 18 songs on this cd there are not there are 7 the following are all you get 1. Jedi Drinking song 2. Angel's Lament 3. Happily Every After 4. Lily the pink 5.Bog Down in the Valley (live) 6. If I had A Million Ducats (live) 7. Mendeiuvium Madness.The songs are great just upset about amazon giving false product info.
5,Literally a go to in the CD car visor,"I own most of this band's discs, acquired from various Texas faires. But, easily, this is my hands down favorite and stays in my car visor, for commutes and road trips out to faire. Andrew and Marc have a special gift for music, especially if you enjoy odd instruments and fun ditty's."
5,Human Pysiology and Mechanisms of Disease,"This is a particularly helpful text to use in ""putting the pieces together"" in disease processes."
2,NOT FOR ADVANCED STUDIES,"As a general practitioner, I don't recommend this book for professionals who want to improve in advanced knowledge in physiology. It is a STARTER book on the theme, for medical students only, not for practicising doctors. I've got frustrated."
3,Only buy this book if you speak German!,"I also bought this book based on a reader review. I don't know what they were thinking! This is all in German! I'm really dissapointed. Oh well, maybe one of my friends in Germany will enjoy it..."
2,poor translation - not in chronological order - fewer strips,"oh well... yes, it's just a german translation. And don't buy it, if you can get the english originals (for those who speak both languages) - it's not worth it at allThis is just an example of poor publishing- the translation is poor, some lines are just mistranslated, some jokes/lines are missed completely (and don't make any sense anymore). I know that the process of translating comic strip is not an easy one, but here it was done amateurishly- the german editions are not a 1-1 translation of the originials, they rather made a couple issues out of one original - and they threw the correct order of the strips overboard, that way you need to buy 10 german c&h books to get the aquivalent of 3 of the orginals..."
1,this is dissappointing,"I ordered this book based on the reviews on this site that this was something original that Bill Watterson put out after Calvin & Hobbes' run. However, it is exactly what it sounds like : a translation of Calvin & Hobbes' in german! Very dissapointing."
3,Missing Description - For Car Audio,"I'm not actually rating this product because after I purchased it I found I couldn't use it. This is because the product description neglected to mention this product is ONLY for car stereo systems and requires a direct 12V DC connection into a car electrical system. There is no AC converter or normal power connection. This is not the product's fault and I can't characterize the product. However, beware if you are looking on using this component for any home audio application.Hope this help's someone else avoid an incorrect purchase."
4,THE map of Regency London,"This is the ultimate map for early 1800""s London. Detail is down to, in some cases, individual buildings. The only drawback is that it is printed at 50 percent of the original map size. While this makes it a more easily formatted size, it also makes it difficult to read much of the text as it is VERY small. It doesn't help that it is written in the stylized script of the time. That being said, this is a very comprehensive, and well reproduced volume for anybody interested in the Regency period. It should really be 4 1/2 stars, only because of the legibility issue."
1,unsatisfied,this web cam was one I bought for a friend overseas. I sent it to her and only the audio works and even that cuts in and out. Don't buy this product.
2,This book sucked,"First off I want to say that I'm a Nancy Collins fan. The other Sonja Blue books are excellent. But this one just sucks. The characters are all lame and flat, the plot is cliche, the writing is spotty, the motivations weak, the organization poor. It's VERY obvious that she just slapped it together due to the crossover deal with White Wolf. She deals poorly with the various White Wolf clans and terminology, and her ""personal"" vampire mythos doesn't square at all with the White Wolf world. There are lots of glaring inconsistencies.Don't waste your money on this garbage. Read the other Sonja Blue books."
4,A Vampire book,"I found this book to be a fun read. I must say that I did think that there where some issues with the story, almost as if the author had to force herself to write within the restrictions of VtM. It is not a very bad book, I actually enjoyed it very much though I would like to see more by Nancy Collins done in the same manner. The better the practice the better the book."
3,less charming than the sonja blue trilogy,"It's definitely a nice book to read, but after finishing it, I felt more like having seen a motion picture in the cinema than enjoying some piece of literature. by the way: Ms. Collins definitely has a problem using german words/names, I nearly could assume some kind of quabbalistic intention ;-)"
5,Magic Knights is a great series,"I have all the Magic Knight video's out, so far, and this one had one of my favorite episodes. Episode 15, I think, involved Ferio returning for another appearance *He's so cute!*, and there's a lot of cute and romantic turmoil between him and Fuu when Ferio's seen with another woman. *Oh no!* And, also in that episode, the coolest villian of the series, Innova <3, comes in. He is an awesome character for an evil guy, and the mere fact that he's so cruel in the episode makes him even cooler. The Episode before it, though, was rather bizarre, because it wasn't needed and merely showed Hikaru bleeding alot. Not that it matters, though, because the video was still great and I recommend it to any MKR fan! *Fuu rocks!*"
5,God and Your Stuff,"Whoa! Very insightful, 'make you look at yourself and your beliefs' - our study group read it and loved it or hated it depending on whether it nailed us or not!"
3,Be careful,These may look nice...as does all Monster Cable products. But make sure they fit your receiver before buying them for all connections.
5,Fabulous,"I just received this lovely faucet. It is much heavier than I thought and the finish is beautiful. Quality seems superior to those in the building supply stores. It is for new construction and hasn't been installed but my plumber thought it was a great deal. Best price was on Amazon. I couldn't be more pleased.***I have had this faucet in my kitchen for a year now and love it! Have had many compliment and no problems. It is a lovely high quality faucet. I actually have 2, one at the sink and another on the island."
2,Disappointed,"This faucet is classy on the outside, but the water flow is very slow. The mechanism inside the faucet seems not to work properly impeding the flow of water from the faucet. I was very disappointed with the performance after spending so much money."
4,Fun!,"I wouldn't say that any of the wrestlers who contributed to this album are ready to branch of as recording artists, but it sounds like they had a lot of fun, and that's what counts."
5,A must have DVD,Most of the time my daughter sits and watches TV! She doesn't move a muscle! Put this DVD in and she is up and dancing! I would highly recommend this DVD!
4,"GOOD, BUT!","This set is good of course, but if you are looking for great performances for EACH of Haydn's 12 London symphony, you may want to buy individual discs. Here is my collection of the 12 'London' Masterpieces.Symphony 93: Goodman/Hanover Band (Hyperion 66532)Symphony 94: Monteux/Vienna Phil (Decca 452893-2)Symphony 95: Britten/ECO (BBC 8008)Symphony 96: Harnoncourt/Concg. Orchestra (Teldec/Warner 21337-2)Symphony 97: Szell/Cleveland (Sony 67175)Symphony 98: Jochum/LPO (DG 437 201-2)Symphony 99: Davis/Concg. Orchestra (Phillips 442 614-2)Symphony 100: Walter/Columbia (Sony 64485)Symphony 101: Mackerras/St. Luke's (Telarc)Symphony 102: Dorati/Philharmonia Hungarica (Decca 452 259-2)Symphony 103: Kuijken/La Petite Bande (DHM 77362)Symphony 104: Hickox/Collegium Musicum 90 (Chandos 0655)"
5,Volume 2 of Haydn's greatest symphonies,"This second volume of Joseph Haydn's ""London Symphonies,"" recorded by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and Sir Colin Davis, is a wonderful listening experience. My Amazon.com review of ""The London Symphonies, Volume 1"" (dated May 7, 2000) applies with equal enthusiasm to this disc set. It is in every way an outstanding version of these great works -- the best available today, and a fantastic bargain! Awarded a rosette by the Penguin Guide to Compact Discs, (The rosette is the Penguin Guide's highest accolade, given to recordings of special distinction.) it belongs on every classical music collector's CD shelf."
5,Definitive Recordings of Haydn's Late Symphonies: Part II,"Sir Colin Davis earned his reputation as a fine interpreter of Haydn, partly due to splendid recordings such as these. Both the Penguin Guide and the Grammophone Guide Classical CDs rate these as the finest recordings of Haydn's ""London"" symphonies. They are magnificient performances played with much enthusiasm and warmth by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. Although there are a number of fine digital recordings of these symphonies around, none seem as elegantly played as Davis' splendid readings. The sound quality is superb, due to Philips' state-of-the-art digital remastering. Along with the two CDs in Volume One, these definitive recordings should be a part of any classical music lover's CD collection."
5,Masterpiece,This is perhaps the finest piece of industrial ever created. A mixture of hard edged dark electronic with some of the finest sampling ever done.
5,REMASTERED VERSION>,"This is to my knowledge either the verry first album by Velvet Acid Christ or it is certainly one of the early albums originnally released...err, probably in the mid 1990's or so. This is the remastered version...and yes it sounds better. Great album loaded with samples from 12 Monkeys and all kinds of Sci-Fi thrillers from the 1990's. Definitly a Terror-EBM/Electro-Industrial band. Uber dark and sofisticated weirdness. Great artwork inside and all of the lyrics are included. If you like spooky techno music that sounds like it was produced in the pit of hell....than you'll love Velvet Acid Christ. Also check out Yelworc...another super creepy electronic industrial band."
4,Very feminine sandals,"These are very feminine slides. They are a little bit narrow, though, and after wearing them for long, the straps feel to tight. But since the shoes are made of genuine leather, I hope they loosen up."
4,Fits any cup holder,"I had to use one of the adapters included but it works just great, ipod stays in place and it's easy to remove from it."
4,"Overall, a great product","I'm actually using this for a classic Zune, and it works great. I've been very pleased with this product from Belkin. The materials are high quality, cord management is built in, and it holds my music player securely. It fits well in my cup holder, is low profile, and the tilt is adjustable. Definitely recommended."
4,just a little wobbly,I had to 'fix' this ipod holder with a bicycle hand grip to stop it from shaking my ipod. I have a decent car and the roads are just ok but this thing shakes and shakes. I also put one of those beer coolers around the base of the foam hand grip and its now rock solid. Oh yeah and it holds the ipod just right too. I also put some of those velcro dots on the bottom for a little more security from my cup holder.
4,Great....almost perfect.,"For what it is made to do, it falls short of perfect. The problem being, it has a sucktion cup on the back to make it stay put. So if you plan on taking it out easily with one hand at whim you have to re-think things and use two hands."
5,This is the best salt ever!,I love Real Salt. It is salt without the aluminum taste of regular table salt. It enhances flavor but doesn't overwhelm with chemical aftertaste.
5,So this is what actual salt tastes like,"Forget the bright white, perfectly crystallized salt you're used to seeing in your grinder - Real Salt is the completely unprocessed version of the same thing, retaining all of the minerals and beneficial compounds that are lost otherwise. Apart from the pinks, reds and grays you'll see in the packet, the most obvious difference is the taste and it can really help draw out the flavors in your cooking. Regular table salt apparently has a range of chemical additives, none of which are present here so if you like your food unprocessed, Real Salt is an essential ingredient in your kitchen."
4,I love real salt.,"So much better than the mineral zapped table salt, and you don't feel the need to use as much.I will order this product again."
1,"Salt tastes great, the dirt and sand ...not so much...","This crap is made by a lazy company that leaves the dirt and sand in there and calls it minerals. If you like adding sand to your salt before sprinkling it on your favorite foods, this is the salt for you! If you like a salt that is loaded with minerals and flavor without the grit, get Spice labs Himalayan salt. That's what I did and I will never again spend my money on this gritty crap that they could have filtered but that would take too long and cost too much?Yet another company out of Utah that cuts corners and compromises our health...the other company is concentrace mineral drops ... that product was endorsed by a scientist who now removed his endorsement after seeing the filthy conditions that company now uses! Something wrong with Utah?!"
2,Hole in bag!,"Bag came with a hole! The entire box was filled with salt and don't accept returns, I was hoping to make this product my salt of choice for everyday use but never again will I buy this!!!"
1,Too Gritty--Does not dissolve in hot food or hot water,"I bought this product believing it to be a healthy product. While it may be healthy, the salt does not dissolve--or maybe it's sand others have referred to. Eating a casserole or pasta dish with this salt is horrible--it ruined the dishes because it was so gritty. I prefer not to feel like I am chewing something that sand was sprinkled on. The salt (or sand?) does NOT dissolve in meals where it's added & cooked with the meal."
2,"Crunchy, and not in a good way","I agree with the other reviewers who noted that the salt has insoluble particles in it. These can really hurt your teeth! OK it's supposed to be natural, but I do not see why I have to pay so much $$$ for salt that has sand in it, no matter how much more tastier it is. I mean seriously people, it's SAND... in your FOOD! Do you eat manure fertilizer with your organic produce? I don't think so.Maybe realsalt has sand in it so that it boosts the company's profit margins... I mean it adds to the weight that would otherwise be used by REAL salt.I also find the pitch about the natural minerals to be hogwash. I mean, yea it does have some trace amount of potassium, but also aluminum, tin and so on."
5,The only salt my husband will use,"I have always felt that salt is salt is salt.... my husband however is another story all together. He brought a number of his own customs to our marriage and Real Salt Sea Salt was one of them. He won't use anything else and scowls ferociously at all other inferior salts I've tried to introduce to our kitchen over the years. I will give him this... the Real Salt does taste better than any of the other stuff out there, but it is a bit more expensive than the plebian grocery store stuff. I finally decided it's worth the price difference if he's happy and cooking (means I don't have to!) The fact that I can find this stuff on Amazon AND use our Prime shipping totally made my day!"
2,Too much Sand! Sensitive teeth beware!,"Great flavor but just can't stand the hard pieces of sand (I think it's sand anyway)I have sensitive teeth and this sand will actually put tiny chips your teeth. It's not just one piece of sand per teaspoon either, it's several. Maybe I got a batch that's worse than normal but I'm not ordering anymore. If there was a way the company could filter this out it, this salt would be great!"
5,perfect for six pack Small cooler,This can cooler block works great in conjunction with the small cooler block in our small cooler. we put in our cans then the six-pack block then the small block on top to help keep the well needed cool ones for softball cold.
2,Blue Can Cooler,"My Blue Can Cooler does not make the beverage cans very cold. I'd place 6 soda cans in a cooler made for just 6 cans and place the Rubbermaid Blue Can Cooler in between. I tried it in a small cooler hoping that all the cooling effects of the Can Cooler will be concentrated in a small area, but the beverages still did not get very cold. The blue gel in my Can Cooler is only a little more than half way full. I know we have to consider the gel will expand, but when frozen there is still alot of empty space in the Can Cooler. Which maybe one reason the cans doesn't get very cold."
2,Too small!,"This looks like the right size to fit a cooler, but it is too small. Soda cans don't even touch it when it is in a regular six-pack size cooler. What's the point of that?"
5,it freezes,"Place it in the freezer, and it gets cold as ice. Not very complicated, but it works just fine for my cooler."
5,Well made,"I bought the EARLIER molded Rubbermaid can coolers for my Ice Cooler lunchbox to carry bottles of Spring water to work in the summer about a year ago. They leaked at the molding in several places. Blue goo constantly leaked when they melted. These NEW ones I bought seem better made. No noticeable seams to fracture from freezing and refreezing over and over. Time will tell. But after 3 months, they are holding up well. I bought 3, and am buying 3 more for really cold water in the Hot Las Vegas summers. If they only last 40 hours a week for a year, they are STILL cheaper than ice."
4,formed ice pack,"This was a replacement for one that was 10 years old and accidentally left behind. This is not as heavy duty as the original, but we like how it keeps the water bottles cold inside the cooler on our long trips."
4,Amazing!!,I love this item.... You can keep drinks cold for a long extended period of time. I started using it for my sandwiches too in my lunch box.
4,Thorny and fun,"I disagree with the other review for this play. I directed a production of it, and it was very well-received, and by a crowd of jaded theatre-goers, no less. It's a great play for young directors, as it requires a simple, flexible set, and provides some excellent and insightful scene study."
1,Amateur Theatricals,Interesting that this would be published. A transcript of the average middle-school talent show would yield a more diverting result.
5,LUV Being a Fly on the Wall,Anis Nin was a glorious writer. She was also a unique and complex individual and way before her time. This book is a glimpse into the person that she was and to be a fly on her wall. How amazing to see the inner workings of such an intelligent being.
1,Mr. Gasket 9627 Chrome Plated Shifter Ball,This was a cheap light shift knob which utilizes adapters and an allen screw. It was too flimsy for my needs so I purchased a Razo RA25 to replace it.
1,Returned it - Unusable Product,"I love the concept, but the implementation was horrible. Every time there was a bright flash on the screen, the video selector would try to select a different source and the signal would ""blank out"" for a second. It was unusable and I returned it."
2,6 system auto selector video/audio - CAUTION,"First it isn't a game that I'm reviewing so I have no idea how much fun it is. This auto switch seems to work but be careful. It isn't actually a 6 system switch. It will switch 2 systems or 4 systems but not 6. It has 4 inputs for video/audio and 2 inputs for S-Video/audio. Then for output you have a single video, S-Video, and the R/L audio. The S-Video output only connects to the S-Video inputs. So this can be a 2-way S-Video/audio switch. The video outputs connect to the video inputs. So this can be a 4 way video/audio switch. It can only be a 6-way switch if you can connect to the exact combination of video and S-Video and you have both Video and S-Video inputs into your TV."
4,Naki 6 System Auto Selector S Video,Useful tool for video processing or routing input video devices with a DVD recorder. Very good price and happy with the product.
4,Ladder Match,"This three disc dvd set features a good combination of matches from the bret hart days to today. Despite the good variety of ladder matches, most wwe fans may not feel the need to really purchase this disc set since they probably already have most of the matches in this set. However, it is good to have a set with all the ladder matches together and to take a look back at wrestlers such as edge, the hardys, and hbk whose careers rose to superstar and ( in the case of shawn michaels ) even legendary status due in large part to the ladder match. This is a good disc set that any wrestling fan should check out."
4,GREAT!!!,"An Awesome, action-packed DVD that covers every great ladder match of the last 20 years! Though it doesn't have the triple ladder match from WM2000, that match has been released time and time again so it doesn't hurt the dvd much. if you love the death-defying ladder match, buy this DVD!"
1,No Idea!!!!,"I have NO IDEA about this product i bought on Nov.27th,because the person i bought this from has yet not sent it to me and today's date is Dec.30th.So i would rate this person i bought it from,a big fat ZERO!!!! I guess he just stole my money,because i HAVEN'T RECIEVED MY DVD YET!!!!!!!!"
3,Well im sure it WOULD work fine....,"Unfortunately, my tape was dried up and had lost it durability and adhesiveness. This tape is easy to tear (im guessing) and probably would be vetry sticky if it came new. Still a great deal for about seven bucks."
5,Practical and purposeful.,I used this book with 2nd grade students. The book brought so many more ideas and areas into play. This book was the focus of our entire quilting unit. Many reproducables and hands on activities. The paper plate punch was a big hit.
5,Excellent! Great even for non-trekkies!,"This is an excellent novel. It is based on the DS9 episode of the same name, but brings so much more out with respect to Benny Russell. The episode itself was a wonderful exploration of someone who had a dream in the 1950's that all peoples could someday live and work together in harmony and the book expands on this even more. Barnes has crafted a first rate novel, and the fact that it is a Star Trek novel doesn't detract at all, but adds to what he's done. In a world filled with conflict and racial tension, Star Trek gives us hope for the future. It allows us to hope that the human race can someday be one and explore the stars. This novel gives that idea a very relevant twist. Things are certainly better now than they were for Benny Russell, but there is still a long way to go."
5,"""Wonder-full"" and wonderful book!!","I liked the episode, but the book was so much better there's almost no comparison. Steven Barnes' story of Benny Russell's struggle to preserve his dream of ""Deep Space Nine"" against racism blends a Christ-figure with the same restrained, tolling tone as Langston Hughes' poetry to show a man whose passion is such that it elevates his ""fiction"" to the level of prophecy (inside the Trek universe, anyway). Read this story and then consider its basic premise in general terms. Your life just might change in unexpected ways."
4,I HAVE ALREADY REVIEWED THIS UNDER NEV.HEAT AND FAKE OUT.,"GOOD MOVIE PIA AND TELLY WERE GOOD TOGETHER IN THIS. DESI JR. WAS ALSO. D.-W.,K7NEJ"
2,De-Lovely Is Not So-Lovely,"This is not exactly a film dedicated to Cole Porter's fans.While the movie featured Cole's musical oeuvre in gusto (unstoppable cameo appearances by popular artists of this day), it focussed rather tiresomely of Cole's bisexuality and incessant philandering over the course of his married life until his famous riding accident. Ashley Judd was as usual a show-saver but then her role was merely supportive to Kevin Kline's half-baked portrayal of Cole Porter.For a glimpse of Cole's ingenuity at its best, check out ""Kiss Me Kate"" directed by George Sidney in 1953 for the MGM studios. This is possibly the most delightful silver screen rendition of Cole's best-loved musical, complete with truly show-stealing choreographed dance seqeunces sure to sweep you off your feet."
5,Wonderful,Saw Midnight in Paris and then i had to see DeLovely again - Cole Porter songs on both. Great music - Cole Porter is the best
4,It's Cole Porter!,"There are certain aspects of Cole Porter's life that Hollywood wouldn't dare to show on screen when the composer was around. Still, Cole Porter was ""the"" popular composer in American music, so that no criticism on behalf of the screen writers can put the composer's fan off. In fact, DeLovely is a nice film as far as Porter's inspiration from Linda is beautifully displayed on screen. The Blu-Ray edition is a must for collectors, showing a picture a picture and sound quality that the latest DVD edition could not get even close. Highly recommended."
2,Winkler Over His Head,"Why, oh why, would anybody think it was OK to have Elvis Costello perform Cole Porter music?And it does not stop there...Sheryl Crowe's strange vowel sounds, Ashley Judd acting sophisticated...When people curse the chance that we wasted...Kevin Kline is a marvelous choice to play Porter, both young and old. He's smooth, charming and compelling, and yet can portray the self-absorbing and cruel qualities that were also a part of Cole Porter.My sorrow is that future generations will possibly hear Sheryl Crowe from this film and think of Porter in those terms..."
2,DVD case was in bad shape,"The movie is great and the price is too. However, the DVD case has tons of ripples in it and the security tape was stuck to the paper DVD cover. DVD was in perfection condition and was a good price though."
3,Begin the Beguine??,"I like the movie a lot, but I like the songs even more. I'd seen ""Night and Day"" not too long before I saw this film, and as laughably bad as the Cary Grant movie is, I have to say I missed the songs presented in some kind of context (like ""Anything Goes,"" for instance). Still, I was OK with the picture until... ""Begin the Beguine."" In one of the featurettes on the DVD, the musical director explains that he wanted the song to reflect what was happening in Porter's life at the time. BUT HE RE-WROTE THE SONG!!!! And, evidently, the Porter Estate was cool with that. Maybe they were, but I'm not. You simply do not re-write a Cole Porter song; to do so takes unbelievable gall. As far as I'm concerned, it seriously damages what overall is a pretty good movie. Pity."
2,Delovely was a big disappointment,"I went to this film thinking that I would hear some wonderful Cole Porter songs - songs which I fondly remember.What a letdown. With one exception, the songs were badly sung by singers who just didn't have what it takes to sing songs that are truly singable - perhaps that is because truly singable songs are conspicuously lacking from musical theater today.The costumes, despite having been designed by a famous designer, were poorly fitting and very unflattering to the women wearing them.If you want to hear Cole Porter as he should be sung, treat yourself to a CD of the 2000 Broadway Revival."
2,it comes up short,"Cole Porter is One of the Greatest songwriters ever.I use to listen to his Album where Ella Fitzgerald Covered His Material. anyway this Film feels way to Broadwayish for my tastes&glossy beyond belief in spots where it needs to make points. Ashley Judd is a Foxy lady but still a Lightweight Actress to me. Kevin Kline is a Decent Actor,but He is missing something here.the only Musical Number Highlights was when Natalie Cole was singing. the rest of those folks needed to exit ASAP. all they needed was Natalie Cole&Maybe throw in Nancy Wilson along with Harry Connick Jr for the musical Numbers.this film should have been way better than it was presented.I Mean the Guy was One of the most Important Songwriters ever.he deserves better.the film couldn't really flip the real life situation into a Proper Modern day feel.the reationships&whatnot felt generic."
5,De-Lovely,An amazing motion picture has been transformed into an even more amazing DVD. This is movie making at its best! Kevin Kline is one of our best actors.
1,De-Stinker,"I'm a very patient person with books and movies, continuing to plod on under the pretext that ""it's got to get better"". Sorry, it never happened with this movie. When it was in production, and having a weakness for old musicals and bios, I was avidly looking forward to it. But what a mess. A concept of flashbacks that also killed ""Beyond the Sea"" should be dropped - just tell the story. And Kevin Kline should shoot (or at least fire) the manager who keeps booking him with roles like this as and ""In & Out"". Kline should definitely go back to his ""Wanda"" comedic talent.One star for the beautiful costumes, but that doesn't make a movie. Read a book about Cole Porter, and put on some music of his instead, because after x number of times that the Porter is this film sits down at the piano, you'll want to scream."
2,Missing two key songs,"How can you do a biography of Cole Porter and leave out his two greatest songs--""I've Got You Under My Skin"" and ""I Get a Kick Out of You""???"
2,Could not get through it,"Ashley Judd was very good here, but the way the story was presented left me flat.. I could not get through it and rented it mainly for the performances of the musicians Alanis and Sheryl Crow, but I could even watch it to that point. I really like these actors but not here. How many films were produced from this mans era that the could have givin it a good feel but it played out to me like second rate, should have been more of a biography than a musical stage play,, sorry..."
1,Disappointing,"Not only was I disappointed with this film, I would say it is one of the worst films I have seen in a very long time, and that's saying something. The acting is unconvincing, why people like Robbie Williams and Elvis Costello have to be singing the songs I don't know, and the way the story is presented is lacking any imagination. Avoid at all costs."
1,What in the world???,"Can you give a movie less than 1 star? We tried to watch the movie but it was very boring. I like Cole Porter's music, but this movie did nothing for me."
1,d e lovely,not worth the money. Should have read the credits - one star is too a high rating for this terrible imitation of the original film. I recommend it to no one.
4,Entertaining,"There are two reasons why I don't rate this 5 stars. It is historically incorrect in several parts. For instance, Fred Astaire sang Night And Day on Broadway, not some guy named Jack. And there is a bit too much about the sex life of Porter. I just fast forward past those scenes and watch the musical numbers, which are great. People who complain about the arrangements are off the wall. This was made in 2004, why should they rehash the same old arrangements? The music is great and the sound and staging is beautiful. The CD is also terrific. We loved it. If you like musicals and you like classic songs, you'll enjoy it, as long as you truly believe that someone else besides Sinatra and Ella can perform these songs!"
2,Disappointing and Depressing,"Not a completely horrible movie. In fact, it could be said the movie was done fairly well - the acting was good, the costumes and sets were great, and it had an unexpected twist on telling a story. However, that interesting twist was also annoying, but obviously they were going for some art nouveau type of presentation. For the ""characters"" in the movie, Kline and Judd deliver believable performances. The movie was a disappointment for me, however, as I expected something very different than what this particular movie focused on. Neither the movie nor the soundtrack had much to do with the music of Cole Porter. This was all about showcasing Mr. Porter's ""other"" life, and subsequently, emphasizing the more cynical, tragic, and depraved side of his life and music (emphasizing the more seedy lyrics). Very sad and depressing."
1,Dead on Arrival,"The music of Cole Porter remains timeless, but his life story makes for less-than-compelling cinema, as evidenced by the mostly fictional ""Night and Day"" (1946). Unfortunately, director Irwin Winkler believed that young moviegoers would leap at the chance to see a Porter biography graced by contemporary vocalists such as Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow and Alanis Morissette. For all his good intentions, Winkler should have left well enough alone. Instead, he made ""De-Lovely"" (2004) - the cinematic equivalent of rigor mortis. Despite sincere performances by Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd, the film never catches fire due to Winkler's incredibly flat direction, which sucks the life out of every Porter classic during its interminable two-hour length. There are better ways to honor Cole Porter's musical legacy. Avoiding ""De-Lovely"" is one of them."
3,De-Lovely? You De-Cide,"Somehow this movie adds up to much less than the sum of its parts. I'm not sure how this happened, but I'm not motivated to analyze it, either. I did enjoy and/or was amused by the musical performances by contemporary pop stars, however. Consequently, I found the DVD extra's to be much more interesting than the movie itself, which is quite the opposite of my usual feeling(s). The 'story' of Cole Porter's life as told in ""De-Lovely"" is just incredibly lame, unfortunately; and the big ensemble musical numbers such as ""Be A Clown"" and ""Blow Gabriel Blow"" are too corny. Nevertheless I did not mind sitting through it all patiently once just to enjoy the good bits. Don't expect more, or you'll be disappointed."
4,Life's a musical,"This movie about Cole Porter shows his life in the form of a musical as it flashes back to important scenes, mostly between him and his wife Linda. She marries him, knowing full well that he is a homosexual and she tries mightily to pretend that it doesn't matter to their relationship. Porter's songs are woven throughout the movie and they are wonderful in quality and in number. Kevin Kline does a masterful job playing Porter as a young rogue and later as a bitter, aging man. The real tragedy of Porter's life is that despite the fact that he wrote beautiful and witty love songs, he struggled in his own life to discover what true love is."
3,"Wonderful Cole Porter Songbook, so-so storyline!","This movie re-introduces the music of one of America's greatest composers to a new generation. I've always been a fan of Cole Porter's music. It's interesting that most of the inspiration of his works was his wife. However, I feel this movie probably should have been done in the Broadway Theatre rather than on the big screen. The storyline as a movie should have gone a bit further by tracing his roots as a kid or in high school or college. There are also some singers that I found out of place singing his work, such as Alanis Morrisette and Sheryl Crow. Broadway should have also had a hand in that casting choice. Overall, this is an entertaining retrospect. Give it a try."
2,"A great composer but,,,,,,","I don't think i'll ever understand the new Hollywood. They almost had this one right but....When I go to see a film in the theatre, especially a musical or about a composer such as this, don't you just want to be razzled, dazzled? I do. I don't care about all the other crap that went on in peoples lives. Why do Americans have to know everything about the torrid lives of famous people. Why can't we just be entertained with great musical production numbers and light heartedness.The Hollywood of today just doesn't have a clue how to entertain people."
5,Great reading!,"Before I started Iron Tigers, I reread Mr. Farmer's first novel, Tin Soldiers, and found it just as good as the first reading. Iron Tigers was at least as good as his first effort, if not better. I recommend both of these novels to anyone who desires to escape into an armor combat scenario for a while. Enjoy!"
4,"Another good military thirller, that will keep you engrosssed until you finish it","Steel Tigers surprised me, I thought that after Robert Coyle, I would never be able to read another Tanker Novel.Well Farmer is well on his way to to scooping Harold who I think thee days would find Farmer tough competition.I can't wait for Faarmer to get fully inot his stride, then I will buy all his books"
2,Iron Tigers,"I do not understand why Amazon only offers Michael Farmer's book ""Iron Tigers"" ""new"" that cost nearly $30.00 or more plus another $4.00 for shipping when the price on the cover was $7.50. Any copies of this book at a reasonable price is used. The book I receive was considered new but I would best rate it ""fresh"" as there were several pages that had curl lines where someone may have bent the page back to mark their spot. The book arrived in a reasonable amount of time gift wrapped with a girlish book marker. The book was for myself so I didn't need it to be gift wrapped and I surely won't be using that book marker. So why did I have to pay $30.00 for a $7.50 book? [...]"
3,Farmer's Iron Tigers,Enjoyable read. Not as good as Coyle in character or plot development but still an exciting read.
4,spurs coffee cup,Very satisfied with the product. My husband love it. It fit on the cup holder of the car and have a nice sport logo. The price is high for a coffee mug.
4,Rather long for the material covered.,Good information but rather a long text for what I got out of it. Gives much positioning/spacing information that I do intuitively anyway. The industry seems to love this book but I think that it could be better with a rewrite to make it shorter and give clearer headings and divisions. For an industry person fascinated by typefaces it does include comments on many different typeface origins.
1,garbage!,"Do not waste your time or money. The recipes taste terrible, pieces fell apart! If your little one really wants to make cupcakes, go to a supply store and buy the real thing."
3,"Great Idea, poor execution","Great idea, some of the components are very sturdy, such as the cupcake pan, the part that should be the most fun, especially for preschool girls, is the cupcake frosting squirter. Bake up some cupcakes with the neat pan, load up the frosting dispenser and you find that the lid that is supposed to screw on pops off with the slightest pressure, as an adult you can awkwardly grab it with both hands to force the lid to stay in place while squirting out some frosting, but as a little kid with small hands, this isimpossible. I have no idea why the lid to the forsting thing was not fully threaded, what a disappointment to what otherwise would have been a great idea."
5,Easy and Fun!,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my nine year old daughter who loves to bake. The cards gave great step by step directions easy enough for her to follow. Since all the recipies are from scratch, there were many ingredients to buy. However, The cupcakes came out so cute and delicious! She was so proud that she did it all on her own! A great starter kit for budding chefs!"
5,stomp tokyo - kings of b movie media,"the stewards of stomptokyo.com have written a book that will soon take its rightful place on the coffee table of every b flick buff, right next to the videohound guides and danny peary tomes. its playful tone reads like you're jawing with friends after watching one of the movies in question, and its insight elevates it above an exercise in pointing and laughing. simply put, reel shame rocks."
5,Laughing out loud,"Aside from being a subversive expose of all that Hollywood hype, this book is extremely funny. The authors obviously love the bad movies they write about, but they aren't fooled by them. This should make you look at your local video selection in a whole new light!"
4,Bad films,I have a true weakness for bad films and this book covers them. The only drawback is I wish they would of covered more films.
1,Deserves a Golden Turkey award.,"I thought this would be about the making of bad movies -- interviews with actors and directors, discussions of backstage business, and so on. Nope, it's yet another book of reviews of bad movies. But while Roger Ebert and others assume that lots of people watch movies, these guys state explicitly that the only people who watch movies are heterosexual men. Emphasis on the heterosexual. Boy, are they heterosexual! Evidently the only reason the authors -- or anyone else -- watch movies is to get a glimpse of cleavage.Gee, I thought a few heterosexual men occasionally thought of something besides cleavage -- guess not. Anyhow, the reviews are more offensive than the movies themselves. You'll need a shower after this one."
2,Check out her other CDs first,"There's always something great on any Sonya Hunter recording (here, ""Just Good Music"" and her cover of Lucinda Williams' ""Happy Woman Blues"" are standouts). There are some problems, too. If ""Favorite Short Stories,"" her first album, sounded underwritten (oddly truncated songs, arrangements that crossed the line from sparse to skimpy), 'Headlights..."" (like its title) sounds overwritten, as if some of the songs sat on the back burner for a little too long. ""Know You Want Me"" is a long, meandering song with time shifts that are distracting rather than interesting; ""Bicycle"" is a colorless album closer; ""Stars"" is -- I hate to say it -- twee, and actually reminded me of the Indigo Girls' occasional hymns to workin' on the land. Not a good thing."
5,one hundred and one dalmations,"I watched the disney cartoon of this beloved classic growing up and when I found out it was a book I was ecstatic. It is a very easy but entertaining children read whether its in the classroom or before they go to bed at night. Even as a college student this book captured my attention and imagination with its beloved characters, both good and bad, and fun new characters not mentioned in the movie like cruella devil's husband. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a classic."
4,A lovely story,"I purchased this book specifically to read to my daughters as a bedtime story. I read it as a girl myself and knew the Disney movie didn't tell the complete story (do they ever?). Perdita isn't who you think she is, and several characters are completely missing from the movie as well. It's a lovely book and I'm happy to read it again."
4,A real gem,"A delightful collection of short stories in letter form; an anthology that makes sense, not an anthology that recycles old material. Gail Goodwin's letter story is particularly good."
4,Glimpses of a complicated man,"I think the word ""vacant"" is misapplied to this informative book about one of the world's great thinkers. Perfection is not to be found in any biography. Seeing that people never fully understand or explain themselves, how can anyone else do it? I'd say this bio is a creditable approximation, and well worth reading."
3,Great style - little information,"As other reviewers have said, this is a photo album of the author's kids. The photos are wonderful and enjoyable. The style is relaxed, somewhat candid and mostly black and white. I bought the book to learn more about his technique. However, he does not share much information on how to achieve these wonderful photos. So, I plan on using the book and his photo style as inspiration and the trial and error method to achieve similar photos . Even though it falls short in technical information, I still enjoyed the book and I feel it will be benificial in improving my own photography."
1,I do not recommend this book,"I was looking for specific advice about ""how to shoot"" my kid (photographically). I did not get it. This book REALLY IS just a photo album of the author's own kids. While some people may be able to infer how to achieve great photos of their kids by looking at Mr. Elgort's photos, I needed more ""how to"" instruction. There is very little text in this book at all and I felt the title was misleading. If you are looking for excellent instruction on how to photograph your children (babies in particular) buy HOW TO PHOTOGRAPH YOUR BABY by Nick Kelsh, a far superior book which I bought after trashing this one."
1,Really just a photo album of the author's own kids,"This book arrived wrapped in plastic wrap. This is always a bad sign. When you walk into a bookstore and find a book wrapped in plastic, you know it's because the publisher surmises that if you could actually browse the book's pages, you wouldn't buy it. Anyway, I was looking for ""how to"" advice re composing good photos, putting the subject at ease, etc. However, this book is really just a photo album of the author's own children. It's all very well and good to include such photographs to demostrate techniques, but this book was very short on text. It is literally just page after page of shots of his kids. While I can admire the fact that Mr. Elgort takes great photos, this book didn't help me to learn how to take great photos myself."
3,He's done better,"In order to really experience doc go out onto the dancefloor and hear him live. This Cd isn't bad but a better choice would be ""Unlock Your Mind"". This Cd by itself is mostly house beats thrown together and although it gives the ear a nice blend of sound, unlike the repetiveness of trance or tech, it really doesn't show Doc's full potential either."
3,Hard in thier hustle.......easy on the ears......With Edge!,"This time around jagged edge gives you what they are known for with a slight twist on a already familar sound. Musically it all stays close to what they had the last time but lyrically they branch out creatively. Fans and non-fans should keep thier eyes on this one. ""Walked outta heaven"" is only one of many good singles on this one. If they branched out more musically this time around I would have given them more but overall they came with a solid cd this time around."
1,Why can't we give negative ratings?? ill say -3,"Jagged Edge sucks. R&B right now sucks (for the most part, anyway), just like rap. Every song on this cd sounds so empty, as they should. Someone sat out and wrote these lyrics wanting 15 year old girls to shead tears over them. I think the last song they made that I could actually stand was their first single back in...what? like '97? '98? They're so cookie-cutter it isn't even funny. They're a nice group, but I love R&B--REAL R&B, not this ""thuggish teddy-bear"" mess. When will it end, people?"
1,A Jagged Era,A Jagged Era it is no more. Sadly i must say i dont know what happened to them? Since Jagged lil thrill i see they clearly have no vision in their music direction.I'd purchase something other than Hard...
1,I hate to say it but...,"This album is wack! Trust me, I am one of Jagged Edge's biggest fans but this album was a huuuuuge disappointment. You can clearly hear the lack of direction in this album especially since Jagged Edge decided to part ways from the mentor, Jermaine Dupri, and the Sosodef camp. In fact, the only highlight on this album is the sole Jermaine Dupri-produced track ""Shady Girl"". The first flop of a single entitled ""Walked Outta Heaven"" sounds exactly like their previous hit ""Let's Get Married"". No originality at all and the group's songwriting is far from up to par! Trust me, save your money and buy another album that isn't so bland, say 112's upcoming ""Hot and Wet""!"
2,Boring,"These guys are very talented singers. You can really tell that 2 members are brothers, their harmonizing is excellent and their first album was wonderful. Slow groves that really put you in a sensual state of mind, made you fall in love again. But this one, oh my, was so darn boring it took me three tries to listen to the whole thing in one sitting, I kept turning it off. Finally after I had heard the entire album, I was glad I got it free. These songs are truly dull. Sorry guys, you had a miss with this one. The second song on the CD ""Walked Outta Heaven"" is simply a remake of ""Let's Get Married"" from their first one. Same song, different words. The only song worth listening to ""Tryna be your Man"" is too short and although it's not good it's the best one."
5,J.E. Don't hurt 'em!!!!,"Jagged Edge has been my favorite group for years and I have been anxiously awaiting this cd. These guys have it all they are handsome, respectful men. You don't find alot of that in today's R&B, Hip Hop or Rap. I'm extatic about adding this one to my collection. I was one of the first people in line to buythis cd. I hope the album went triple platnium the first day!"
1,hardly is more like it,I give Jagged Edge Props for hanging around&being able to Maintain a Career but at the same time they haven't showed any Musical growth&Seem like a Group that is Better Served at the Family Bar B-Que Get togethers to Be Paid&Performed than a Group that should Be still making another tired album after another tired Album.seeing them Backing Bow Wow&Neva for me puts them into Perspective.they are better at backing others.the Cats are cool but I ain't feeling there Music Formula&overall Presentation.
2,Oh Boy......,"Jagged Edge really fell off with thic CD. I was (and still am) a huge fan of Jagged Edge. In my opinion, this cd was no good. I don't know what happend to them. This cd was not worth the time listening or the money spent."
2,another boring ass cd,you like tired ballads with lame rappers spitting lame verses this is right up your alley.
4,I Like It...,"JE is on to something. This album is set up similar to JE Heartbreak, which was one of their best and it lets them show off their best asset...ballads. The title track ""Hard"" was a wise choice and some of the best tracks include ""Visions"" ""In The Morning"" and ""Shady Girl"". This is a definite addition to any R& B lover's collection."
3,"""Hard"" ain't out yet...","Did this album not come out in Canada yet? I've been waiting 2 years for this, and I STILL don't have it in my hands! What's the deal?"
2,More of the Same,"This is not a terrible album, but easily forgettable. They have been surviving off the same beats slowed down or sped up for a few years now. I am feeling their harmonies and as for now that is it."
4,They dropped yet another hot album!,"If you have enjoyed the 3 previous Jagged Edge albums (yes, even their old-school first release!) then you are crazy not to get this to add to your collection. I have been a fan since they came out and their albums always live up to my expectations. 4 stars are appropriate for this album, only because I have my favorite (JE-Heartbreak) but otherwise it is on-point! I have no regrets because the songs fill each type of mood.....whether you want a fast-paced tune to get you going or if you are in the mood for a slow love-filled ballad that this group is known for, you won't be sorry! Go out and get this if you don't already have it....it's not a HARD decision :)"
4,This movie was deliciously funny.,"I bought the movie because I am a fan of Yvonne Constant. She only had a cameo role and didn't say one word, but I got a big laugh out of her performance anyway. It was Jeff Goldblum's best role and Hoskins was very funny because he played his role STRAIGHT at all times. This is a movie {Ebert gave it 3 stars] that has a lot of subtle sight gags that are big belly laughs when they sink in and you get them.There is one scene where a bunch of old French ladies force Jeff Goldblum[a Jesus look alike] to try to ""cure"" a blind boy. The boy does see again - but how it comes about is comic inventiveness at its best.I would definitely watch this movie again because even its stupid moments are forgiveable for the BIG BELLY LAUGHS that are gotten from viewing this offbeat comedy."
4,Do yourself a favour and watch this.,"The Favour, the Watch and the Very Big Fish is a quirky, slightly surreal love story about an unassuming 'devotional photographer' looking for someone to pose as Jesus before he gets fired for failing to deliver the 'money shots'. He meets a woman while doing a favour for a friend, and they unexpectedly hit it off. But is she a con artist, or is their love real? And could anyone foresee the consequences of finding Jesus?It's an odd, funny and satisfying film that really ought to be rescued from VHS purgatory. Best Jeff Goldblum crazy-eyes moment in history."
1,"Jomashop is overrated, the worst shop in amazon","I ordered this watch, and came since I opened with a defective crown, could not fix date, I do not believe Breitling will make this mistake after their quality control, this people are selling Chinese replicas, the watch came without international warranty card neither chronometer cerificate, the box is chinese made and the cover came apart, it was glued, I had to send it back, having the confidence it was being refunded, BUT NOT it was shipped back repaired,maybe at a back street watch repair store in N.Y NOT a NEW ONE was sent, since I removed a paper cover on the bracelet, was not elligible for refund, who could imagine that a breitling, coming from this five star GENERAL, store, is selling replicas at prices of originals, amazon claim was filled and they are on their side, BECAUSE A PAPER WAS REMOVED FROM THE BRACELET !!!, I am dissapointed and abused from amazon, and Jomashop,."
5,This mike + stereo = sweet Public Address system,"I needed a wireless mike for an indoor event -- about 120 people. No problem with feedback; sound quality totally acceptable. Did not test for maximum range, but no drop-off within 60' radius. Well made, solid mike. Come with hard plastic storage case."
5,Mic is GREAT!,This mic was oerfect for my son. great quality and was shipped right away! I recommend it for the quality and price1
5,One of the few really Practical books around,"It is unusual to find a book that has exactly the right content presented in exactly the right way at exactly the right time. This was the case for me and Dan's book.Having had some experience with Java and just beginning to involve the As/400, I was going from the relatively easy, intuitive environment of Inprise's JBuilder to the totally non-intuitive Unix shell environment of Java on the AS/400. It seemed that every time I would run into a problem(which was often), Dan had already encountered it and explained it in his book.I would definitely recommend this book for anyone with Java experience who is contemplating working with Java on the AS/400. It will save you many heartaches and lots of time.By the way, the fact that the book uses VisualAge for Java and I use JBuilder was of no consequence.Thanks Dan for providing the right help at the right time"
5,Dear publisher!,I wish it's publishing should be taken rapidily the java book for as/400 is not much.
4,1950s health worker's Native American experience,"This is a biographical account of one nurse's experience working within Native American communities in the southwestern U.S. The nurse, Ida Bahl, graduated from Mercy Hospital Nurses training school in Dubuque, Iowa. Beginning in 1934, she worked with a number of Indian tribes.This book describes incidents which occurred in the 1950s while she served as a public health nurse. Reservation Indians were mainly illiterate and life was hard. Traders took advantage of craftspeople, and diseases such as tuberculosis were prevalent. Ida Bahl weaves social documentary into her nursing experience. Lots of good observations about life in those times.Good inspirational reading, some of it heartbreaking. This book would be of interest to both health workers and Native American advocates."
4,Good stuff...,"We have the black set so reviewing that one here. We've had ours for probably 2 years now and would certainly recommend. These aren't Henckels but get the job done with out a lot of stress on you. I was a bit disappointed that they didn't come through sharper then they did but they seem to take an edge pretty easily. They had been and maybe still are highly recommended by consumers report and that is what got me looking at them. The tang going into the handle and the rivets seem to afford them many years of happy cooking to come. When we purchased ours the price seemed to be right, maybe a special and not sure what they are going for these days but for a good all around knife set that won't break the bank I'd recommend this set for sure."
2,"A lot of potential, but overall a let-down","This could have been a great set. All the larger knives are good quality and can be sharpened to be very usable.The problem is with the steak knives and the serrated edged knives. They are all only edged on one side. In other words, they are perfectly flat on one side and the other has the slanted edge where you cut.This makes all these above mentioned pieces cut at an angle instead of straight as well as much less sharp. It is beyond me why they would do this. How much money could it save them, or were they just stupid?If not for this, I would have given this set 5 stars. As it stands, I would probably go with something else.Addendum: Scissors are pretty cheesy and the entire set was made in China, in case you couldn't guess."
1,Don't buy if you expect to receive this anytime soon.,"I would love to review this item but I can't because I haven't received them yet. Amazon's shipping description says, ""In stock soon. Order now to get in line. First come, first served."" Well, I placed my order for this set of knives Sept 26, 2004 and have yet to receive them. I have just been informed that my shipment will be delayed AGAIN (3rd time) and they will not be shipped until late Feb or early March. When ordering, keep in mind the long line of people in front of you."
1,can't did not receive it,"I ordered this item on December 14, 2006 after I talked to the manager of the DIVA company who assured me this item would be mailed out on December 15, 2006 shipping to Texas from California, and it was in stock, a present for my grandson. Several days later I received an e-mail from Amazon informing me the item was sent by the DIVA company December 19, 2006. Naturally no one returned my call to DIVA. Today December 24, 2006 my daughter informed me she had not received this gift for her son, as much as they charged for sending an item that weighs less than a pound apparently by snail mail this company in my opinion not only lied to me because I told them if they could not get it to the receiepent by 12/25 I would get it elsewhere, they over charged me for mailing and ripped me off. Now I wonder if this item is even any good or if the deal was too good to be true. Stay away from this company!"
4,Solid coverage of the basics of negotiation,"As part of the 17-title Harvard Business Essentials series, launched in 2002, this book solidly covers the basics of negotiation. The clarity of the explanations, range of examples and methodical exposition make it a very useful reference for the beginner or mid-level negotiator. Don't let the very rationality of the book's approach make you think that negotiation is easy. It's just that these instructions make it understandable and accessible. Harvard's expert doesn't dwell on the pressures negotiators face and the resultant anxieties, or give a lot of space to the emotional complexity of dealing with money issues with family or friends. Instead, this is a solid, no-detours, nuts-and-bolts manual. We recommend this book as a primer for up-and-coming or partially experienced negotiators. Start here; when you master this solid base, you can polish your skills with something more advanced."
3,good not great,"fairly decent ideas on negotiation, nothing new here, but would be helpful for people new to negotiation."
5,awesome book,very easy read with great content. needed this for class and actually enjoyed reading it. i wish my other textbooks were this much fun to read.
1,Book Never Arrived!,"I ordered this book, it never arrived, seller refunded my money but it was a huge inconvenience as I needed the book for my class and not having it put me behind in class. Definitely, disappointed and not what I expected!"
4,Sociology textbook,Book came complete w/cd set as described and arrived on tine for me to start my class on time
3,Slow Del,It took almost 3 1/2 weeks to get to me. The book was in ok shape but not as great as they claimed. But hey at least it showed up
1,Shameful,"I order this book from Brenna Moore and requested to know what edition it was. I asked her to send the book if it was the eighth edition ASAP. Later I received the Sociology:A Breif Introduction the seventh edition.I e-mail her to let her know that was not the eighth edition and I wanted to return the book. Brenna stated that she had a NO return policy and that the book did list what edition it was, which it did not."
3,ok if you must take the class,I need Sociology for my major. The class requires this book. It's fine. There are some interesting points but Sociology itself is not very interesting to me.
5,older but still relevant,"this version was pretty much exactly like the newest edition the teacher recommended. i still have it if anyone wants to buy it! :^p Seriously tho, I recommend this book. FYi: The class I took was Sociology 101 during Spring 2010."
5,Brass Wall Plates,"I ordered about 30 of these - both toggle switch plates and outlet plates. They had every configuration that I needed They arrived very quickly. Everything was wrapped separately with tissue and plastic and all screws were there. I am VERY impressed with the quality. They are very heavy brass and they look wonderful on my walls. Great supplier, great service, great quality."
4,Just Ten Minutes - Insightful read!,This book really makes you think about how technology can have both a positive and negative effect on society. My family and I really enjoyed the story and especially the suggested exercises the author provided at the end. We had a good time thinking of other forms of technology and how they could be used. I would recommend the book as a good family project.
4,"Great, BUT so many weaknesses","Yes, in spite of many defects and design issues, I gave this product 4 stars because I use it all the time, and don't know what i would do without it!; buy an i-pod?Great for Audible.Com books - the best audible player I have had. Great storage. Basically, easy to use. Very good sound. And very reasonable price.BUT: buggy software; very sensitive to mist,and knocks and bumps; FM reception is poor and I wish I could record FM, it would be a great addition; control for 'hold' is poorly placed and I often shut-off player when I want hold on/off, unless I am very very careful; carrying case is poor quality and already ripped, and i can't find replacement becasue:; tech support at Gateway is almost non-existent - i am not even sure if they are carrying this anymore as it soesn't show in their product list. . . . .Frustrating, but I don't leave home without it - so i gave it 4 stars because nothing is better."
1,"bad product, bad service","The jukebox was working okay [Though it was buggy from the start] until it died after about 3 months, so I had it sent in for repairs, which they said would take up to 10 days. That was about 4 months ago, so I called to see what the deal was and found out recently that it was ""lost in service."" So I was told a new one would be sent to me, and it would take up to 1 week. That was over 2 weeks ago. I called to get a refund, but apparently that is impossible [Gateway's return policy is 15 days], and I've pretty much just been told to wait for the phantom replacement jukebox, but no one knows how long it will take for it to be sent [by the way, this is just something that annoyed me: Gateway hires some of the slowest and underqualified technical support people ever. One woman didn't even know what an mp3 player was]. I've begun to assume my $350 is lost for good and am starting to look at ipod and sony's new walkman. Never buying Gateway again."
5,Fun ! Outstanding Value!!,I can't say enough about this product!! I'm not a techy but was downloading songs in no time. I can't wait to put my entire CD collection in this player. AAA+++ in my book.
4,Sheedy Strikes Again,"I have read practically everything EC Sheedy has published and she has always kept me entertained. This book went a little astray of her usual, but I thought that the premise was handled well. What would a man do when his deceased wife leaves custody of his stepdaughter to someone else. Add into the mix the grandfather and stepgandmother who is a litte off and you get a story. Although I love Sheedy's sex scenes, I thought it was brought into this story a little quickly without enough story before it. Good story and enough action to keep you busy. I judge every book by one standard, would I read it again and this is one I kept for my permanent library."
1,unbelievably gross,... and there was pretty much no plot. i honestly don't know how it got published. a low for Kensington.
4,Best of Brian Hyland DVD,I was very glad to purchase a copy of Brian Hyland singingsome of his hits. Wish there were more of them. Overall I am very satisfied with the product considering the price I had paid for it.
2,Great singer but poor recordings,"This is about the only video of Brian Hyland available. Given this fact, I can see the 2 reviews are good. But the recordings for this label is not good and that goes for the other artists in this label. I think the reason for this limited video is that Brian did not have many concerts. It's a shame because I like him a lot. He had a very good voice and I like a lot of his songs. I have his CD's but I would prefer a much better dvd"
3,Interesting individual perspective on Brando.,"I liked this book, but was not over-enthused. It is obviously a book written from one individual's point of view, and events in Brando's life are viewed through this prism. As a starter, I preferred Darwin Porter's Brando Unzipped. Lots of racy gossip and it took my breath away with details of the sheer scale of Brando's womanizing and 'manizing'! Richard Shickel's Brando is less racy but with a more broad-brushed approach.The beginning of this book seems a little plodding, self-reverential, and a slightly distracting shift from the very late Brando to earlier episodes. But if you persist past the first 15-20 pages, there is an informative and sympathetic perspective on a truly mesmorizing life."
5,awesome gift @ an even awesomer price,i was searching for some unique pick designs for my seven yr oldand i found thesegreat conditiontimely delivery
5,Revolutionary treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,"As a psychotherapist, this is a pivotal book in successfully understanding and treating obsessive-compulsive disorder. It synthesizes the psychology of St. Thomas Aquinas with modern psychological principles. This therapy is especially helpful for therapists treating Catholic Christians with OCD, as it does not contradict fundamental Catholic teaching, particularly in the area of sexuality."
3,had to buy it,"My son is extremely ill and he insisted i got this book. Was disappointed when I saw what I believe was a 50c price tag on side, must have come from a boot sale. Beggars cant be choosers. Condition was reasonable. I would not have paid what I did if it had been up to me."
5,Quality and Safety at a price,"My wife and I bought this seat for our growing family. Currently we are using it as a booster for our 3-yr old daughter, who finds it very comfortable. She sits up high and has a good view out and the generous padding provides a comfortable sleeping possibility on longer journeys.Side impact system should give good protection, hopefully we will never have to confirm this!Only downside is the very laborious process to convert the seat from infant use to booster use for the larger child. However, this seat will serve your needs from approx 1year up to 10years. Recaro costs a bit more but you can see and feel the quality. Highly recommended."
5,It's been awesome,This car seat has been fantastic. My son seems to fit in it so comfortably and there has been times where he has gotten sick in it and it is reasonable to clean.
5,Just put the seat to the test,"I just put my Recaro Young Sport seats to the test. I was hit by another car in a pretty good side impact; both cars likely totaled. The impact was hard enough to lodge parts of the other car into my tires. After the confusion settled, and I ascertained that my kids were OK, my son had only one question, ""do we have to walk to the movies now?"" The seats worked remarkably well! The kids were well supported, the side impact protection kept the kids firmly in the seat, and the five-point harness spread the stress out nicely and the kids aren't even sore (but I sure am!). I can highly recommend this product, and would like Recaro to develop an adult/driver version."
5,GREAT Car Seat!,"i have been using two of these seats now for 3 years. one is still used with the harnes, the other has been converted & used as a booster seat. we have been using the booster seat mode for 1 1/2 years. it was easy to convert, & easy to adjust as the child grows. the seat is comfortable, my kids say so. the only draw back i can think of is that it is heavy. you don't want to be switching this thing from car to car. but that is also a good thing as it is made very well! we have no rips, no seams coming apart, & the covers are stain resistent & THICK. the really give the kids padding, unlike other car seats i've had. this is a GREAT PRODUCT that will out last the growth of your child. and a sound investment in their safety. WORTH EVERY PENNY! one more thing, it looks complicated but the covers and straps are easy to get on and off for laundering. the easiest i have ever used. & i have worked with my share of seats over the years. you wont regret this buy."
1,PURE GARBAGE!!!,"I paid $30 for this garbage. There should be a negative rating, cuz 1 star is entirely too much for this piece of junk. The tv worked for only ONE day! This is pure garbage and I just hope I can find my receipt to take this back to Circuit City.Don't waste your money!"
5,Portable TV/Radio B&W (3-way Power) WORKS GREAT !,"I bought this and it works great! I have had no problems with it. The picture is clear and consistent. The sound is good. It also has an AM/FM radio. And it still works very well 7 months after buying it. I recommend that you read the super-easy instruction manual on how to set it up and you can take this tv anywhere: to sporting events or keep it in your vehicle, or on your boat or plane. It makes a fantastic gift too. Also you can use it if there's a power outage. ENJOY!"
5,A brilliant book that does work that needs doing.,"This book masters the art of doing politics and cultural critique at the same time and it does it with an honesty and pedagogical clarity I have never seen before. Ranging across archives from mass culture to political rhetoric, Berlant does the very hard work of thinking things through in all their complexity (things like the mutual imbrications of nationalism, gender, class, and race)and she does it with writing that has both the stunning beauty of the perfect description and the too-true turn of phrase and the cutting clarity of thoughts that reverberate through the everyday sensibilities of current life in the USA."
5,6 Stars,"This album is wack. It's the best and you can't stop listening to it. From the beginning you can jam with ""Caile"" which is currently a hit, then you slow down to ""Secreto"" to just get back on pace with ""Maximo"" and you're doing these waves throughout the whole album that before you know it its over. My favorites are Caile, Te Extra&#65533;o, Peligro, Tu Cintura, Flow Natural, Mia. Lol thats almost half the album, but the rest of the songs are also great. The featurings are also good with artists like Daddy Yankee, Beanie Man, Don Omar, and Deevani.You can't miss it!"
5,What is the spirituality of one Jew alone?,"The question above is one of many in this book - the question of Jewish identity and whether an individual can actually be fully Jewish without a sense of community and affiliation with others. Three main areas of Jewish identity are explored: Unaffiliated Jews, Jewish Community and New, even radical directions in Jewish practice and identity. Because there were many 1st person accounts, this book was lively and interesting to read. It raised questions in my own mind about what it means to be a Jew in America today. Fascinating!"
4,Repetition pt. 5,"the music of The Fall is both engaging and off-putting...equal parts clever and brilliant mixed with the confounding and annoying. the casual fan of punk or post rock will probably be confused. and that my friends, may be the point. or maybe not. you decide. take a listen.Another great record by the Fall and the first one to feature Brix on guitar. the songs have gotten a little shorter and a little more catchy...but only in that Fall sort of way. this edition contains a whole slew of bonus tracks, but i have not delved into them all deeply enough to make any profound observations."
1,What happened?,"Celestial Season used to be one of the top doom metal bands of all time back in the early 90's. What happened to these guys? They went to this stoner rock [stuff]. If you are familiar with the Celestial Season of the old days don't buy this album. Go out and buy ""Forever Scarlet Passion"" or ""Solar lovers"" to see what real Celestial Season was. This is just plain horrible. I still can't believe I once called this band a faveorite..."
1,A big mistake buying it,"There are other beauty dishes in the market at one third the price.I read the two glowing reviews for this Elinchrom model and deciding to splurge .I am sure it gives excellent results...when you can make it work. For the top dollar that one pays to buy from a known company,the product comes with absolutely no instructions, no mounting gear or instructions, no explanation...nothing.You are left with a expensive salad bowl with a hole in it. I tried to find information on Elinchrom site,nothing....the model does not exist. Worst of all the dish came bent from one side even being packed very securely,meaning it was packed damaged. Thoroughly disappointed .Next time I will go for the cheaper chinese makes so at least not to feel ripped off. If someone can share information on how to mount it,will be extremely grateful ."
1,Overpriced and feeding on consumer ignorance!,"Don't buy into the hype the sales people at Big Box stores or Monster feeds you. Folks, there is no need to spend this over inflated price on an HDMI cable.There is an article in NY Times on June 10, 2009 about how to tweak your HDTV to make it perform at its best. The article specifically advises readers not to be tempted to spend too much on cables. It also quotes industry expert Joe Kane. His advice: ""Cheap cables that cost 75 cents per foot work as well as those that cost $100 per foot,"" said Mr. Kane. ""With the latest HDMI cables, if you see a picture and hear the sound, you know it works."""
4,Works well....but is it worth it,"I'm going digital. The whole house, little by little, is getting 1080-ied. So after spending a bit of cash on these, i started reading more about HDMI on the net. it is actually the most complex consumer cable ever made. and while many claim that with digital you either get the signal or you dont, i foud out that this is not necesarily true. but i also found that when going short distances, some $10 hdmi cables will perform as well (or even better) than cables worth 5 or 10x that.after reading quite a bit, i found this to be one of the most helpful articles:[...]in conclusion, I like this product. It is glitch-free. But if you are going 6 or 10 feet, you need not invest heavily in cable."
1,Don't believe the hype,"There is absolutely no difference between monster cables and the cables you get at monoprice.com. I have a PS3, HD-DVD, DirecTV and a HDMI switch box all hooked up with supposed inferior cables and I haven't had one single problem. The picture on my TV is incredible."
1,Waste of Money,"This book is a nearly worthless collection of essays. I suspect the two folks who gave it five stars contributed it to it. Notice that they have not bothered to put their real names or to review anything else.The problems I have with the book include the following:1) It's not advertised as a collection of academic essays, but that is all it is.2) It is not suitable for reference.3) It is not an accessible introduction to psychometrics for someone new to the field.4) It is not comprehensive.On the plus side:The essays are written by psychometricians for psychometricains, most of whom hold advanced degrees in this very specialized subjects.Overall: This thing is a complete waste of money for most of us. I wish I would have sent it back as soon as I received it."
4,Great Baptism Outfit,"I recently purchased this outfit for my Godson's upcoming baptism. Since it will be in December I wanted something warm for him. It's still a little thin so he will need to wear a onesie underneath but that is the only drawback if that counts as one. The outfit looks even better in person than it does online and it also came with a preservation bag which I love.He will be 6 weeks old and about 9lbs at his baptism, so according to the size chart I bought a 3mo instead of newborn. I tried the outfit on him (at 3 weeks old) and the shirt fits nicely with a little extra room, but the pants are very long. They fit well in the waist though so we will just roll them up that day. He looks so handsome in this little outfit."
4,Exactly what I was looking for,"This just arrived and I love it. So cute. The material is thinner than I thought it would be. My baby will definitely need a onesie, socks, shoes, and hat as well because we are baptizing him in March. But overall a great outfit."
4,Portraying Naked Men and Women at the Peak of Good Health,"Contrary to what one might suppose from its title, this lavish portfolio does not compile nude portraits of celebrity sports figures or body-builder enthusiasts. Rather, most of the pictures included portray the health/hygiene and nature spirituality aspects of the multiform clothing-free movement from its earliest days. Together with a highly informative text, the pictures make evident the relevance of the values and practices of naturist/nudist groups for modern dance, film, art, gymnastics, and the recreational conventions of the larger popular culture. The high quality reproductions are printed on heavy photographic-quality paper and bound in an oversize volume by a firm in Switzerland specializing in the publication of art books. Kuhnst is Professor of Sports Science at the University of Bochum (Germany)."
1,Painful.,I purchased this book hoping for some artistic pictures such as might be suitable for framing. What I found instead is a jumble of photos that are anything but. A completely disappointing collection at best.
1,Hmmm,"Not what I expected at all. Very disappointed. Basically naked people, athletic or not. Many od photos, B & W besides."
3,Did I miss the color and light references?,"Let me preface my review by saying that I am very new to painting. Having tackled a few Bob Ross paintings using the wet on wet technique, I was looking to learn more - so I got this book. I found that the first 45 pages were really the only pages that appealed to me. Discussions on color combinations, a limited palette and ways of discerning color were good pieces of instruction. However, Kevin talked quite a lot about detail in pictures when his paintings are anything but detail. His paintings tend to be a blurred vision. Nothing really in focus and nothing crisp. So after I got his book, I realized I didn't like his style of artistry. My advice is that before you buy this book, make sure you like the artist's paintings."
4,Oil Paintings with Light & Colour,"The best book I have found dealing with this topic, it DOES explain to the oil painter how to 'fill their paintings with light and colour'. Keeping clean colours and light can be difficult without this understanding and the technical knowledge of how light works in the landscape and in the viewer's perspective."
4,oil painting books,Great book. The step by step instructions are good for learning how to layer the colors. Good for beginners or pros.
1,Malfunctioned the very first time I used it!,I was excited to use this Rotalux Octagonal Softbox but when I was assembling it one of the rods poked right through the fabric pocket that is supposed to hold it in place! Where is the QUALITY?
2,Completely wrong item sent,"They not only sent a white USB cable, when it specifically said it was black .... but the item sold was allegedly an APC product, which I trusted. It had no brand name or labeling on it at all. It would probably work, but I'm not getting what I paid for if it's not an APC product. It was like the old ""switch-a-roo."""
1,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE QUALITY WITH THE ""BLUE""","i bought this pseudo MONSTER CABLE on September 29, 2006. on October 30, 2006, the ""BLUE"" went out! i started getting blue lines through the video. and then all of a sudden, the picture was GREEN & RED! the BLUE was totally gone! i did several tests and the BLUE cable is shot! i dont know how, but it must be a manufacturing problem! i bet they have a 30 day warranty, cuz 31 days later, it crapped out on me! ***DO NOT BUY***"
2,"Oops, wrong size","I bought this set in an attempt to improve the quality of analog to DVD using a Canopus box. The problem was, the cable jacks were too large for my VCR's component output. They fit in the jacks, but were loose would only provide a connection when I jiggled them about. I've never had this problem with this type of cable before, very disappointing."
2,Real product?,I'm not too sure if the cables are the real monster cables because the case looks like it has been opened and then stapled back. It seems to be working okay so far but I haven't used it too much yet.
3,No quality improvement,"I was using bottom of the line, 8 foot cords, for all my connections... I figured having a shorter cable, made of gold, would make the picture even better than it was... There was absolutely no quality improvement by switching to these... I have great eye sight as well... Both my roommates agree with me as well... These are great if you want short, easily manageable cords, but not worth the money if it is just for ""quality"" improvements..."
3,Um... It's Just WIRE and CONNECTORS,"I've purchased a lot of cable recently including S-Video, Component Video, and Optical Cable. I purchased this short cable to run data from my progressive scan DVD player to my Denon 987. And to be perfectly honest, the stuff Sears sells in their audio/video department works just as well as Monster and costs quite a bit less. Mind you, I'm not anti-Monster, heck my house is filled with 100s of feet of 16-gauge Monster THX cable. But you can get really good cable for a lot less if you look around. Try Ebay for starters..."
1,its just a standard component cable..,compared this cable to a philips performance component cable and i am not impressed it was the exact same in picture quality.all your paying for is the name..why spend 50$ when you can spend 20$ on the philps and get the same thing??
1,horrible,"I think this book is horrible. You can read pages and pages, chapters and chapters and at the end you won't be able to write a single line of code."
5,"Must have for researh in Wetzel County , WV","This book was written at the turn of the century as is packed full of very interesting subject matter concerning Wetzel county, West Virginia and the surrounding area.It covers the Jennings Gang and the little known Indian mounds that were located along the Ohio river in New Martinsville.I highly recommend this book."
5,Needed,"Needed for dental school. Eh, good book for what it is. A lot better to do it than read about it. I guess it is good for a required book, good source of info."
1,Silly Me,"I ordered this DVD having listened to the concert many times on CD. Foolishly, I did not realize it was a Region One DVD and I have not been able to play it in Australia, which is frustrating. I would love to see it if it has ever been produced for Region Four. I have gone back to the CD to assuage my frustration."
4,Actually 4.75 stars!!!!!,"One little flaw to a spectacular concert---but it might justbe personal opinion.....On the CD soundtrack version of this concert, the extra song, ""Papa, Can You Hear Me"" is featured---This DVD does not feature the above song at the end of the concert-- but it's on the CD----Makes me wonder why---- it's the best song on the CD!!!!!Shame it wasnt featured on the DVD---But comparison or not,, Mike never ceases to enchant us!!!!"
3,Crawford Can Sing & Talk Well,"I heard three of these songs on television and thought this must be a super tape, so I bought the VHS when it came out. Unfortunately, the three songs I heard and saw on TV were the best of the lot. However, that's not imply this isn't a good concert, just the great one I anticipated. I have also seen Crawford live in a Las Vegas show and he's quite the showmanThere is a lot of talk between some of the songs, too much at times, but Crawford is an interesting guy and humorous in his storytelling.The two songs I liked the best and heard first on TV were ""Not Too Far From Here"" and ""Music Of The Night."" Crawford performs several songs from ""Phantom of the Opera"" including a really nice duet. In addition he sings several Christian songs and a few more secular songs, all in good voice. The second half of this concert was far better than the first half, IMO.The man has a tremendous voice so no matter what song you hear, it's done well."
5,Michael Crawford in Concert,"Absolutely fantastic, makes a great gift.The sound quality is great and his voice is unbelievabley beautiful. Got it in record time, excellent seller from Amazon. Well worth the purchase."
3,Okay but a little disappointed,"I did a lot of research looking up the perfect stuff dog for my 1 year old son who recently started loving on all his big sisters puppies. This one seemed to be just right...big,fluffy,soft and cute, plus an added bonus of a pillow when laying flat....however, the thing is sooo squishy/floppy it doesn't sit up like the pictures show. It always falls down into the laying position (maybe velcro would help keep the legs together to sit up. Also, the fur is cheaply glued on to the mesh like skin. It was coming off at some points and was actually very prickly. When trying to take out prickly fur before allowing son to have it, I reallized it was quite a bit and left some bear spots. It was just really poorly made. Washing it only makes more fur come off. Would not recommend! Would recommend going to a store to pick out stuffed animals in the future so that you know the product you are buying."
2,"I like Lenny Bruce just fine, but...","I always thought of Dustin Hoffman as Tootsie, which I haven't seen, and the movie producer from WAG THE DOG, which I love. Or RAIN MAN, another fine film. But hey, the guy can give us a nasty edge if the script calls for it. Hoffman became Lenny Bruce. Bruce's material was great at times and awful at others. Nowadays, of course, none of it would be shocking. The film shows us Bruce's faults, unedited, presumably in contrast to the great material he could produce because of and/or in spite of his excesses. But still, something is missing. Something crucial. I don't know what. I only know this film could have been so much better."
1,incompatible,"This DVD was not compatible with any of my players,or I assume any others made for the USA, although this was not mentioned in the product's description."
3,It was just OK,"I usually enjoy Bollywood movies. But of late of have noticed a disturbing trend that was very evident in this movie. Many Bollywood movies are trying to be too Western/American and losing the vivid portrayal of Indian culture that made them such a hit to viewers such as myself.In this movie, although the theme is a good one, the constant use of American slang and mannerisms became annoying after a while. I can appreciate the importance of portraying the Indian experience both inside and outside India, but this portrayal was barely believable. It appeared to be forced. I would not have minded so much had the Americanisms been necessary or relevant to the storyline, but they were not. It was just an unnecessary distraction."
2,Very disappointing,"I'm a big fan of peanut butter and cheese crackers. If you are too, then don't get these. Another reviewer mentioned how old these must be and I have the same question. The crackers were bone dry and tasteless while the peanut butter had no moisture content at all. It could have been applied with a trowel. I won't try these again, so I'll go for the Planters brand next time and hope for better results."
5,Great price on these crackers!,"I usually buy these at my local supermarkets but lately they have been out of stock about half the time. I checked with Amazon and sure enough ... in stock at a better price than local! I ordered a six pack and they arrived the next day even though I had chosen 2 day free shipping with my Prime membership! I found them to be as fresh, if not fresher, than those I buy locally. I use about one 8-count pack per week so I put four of the six packs in the freezer. No more out-of-stock worries!"
5,Great case for the Olympus PEN E-PL1!,"I was struggling to find a good usable case for my Olympus E-PL1 micro four thirds based camera. I wanted something to protect it when I toss it in the car or in larger suitcases. This case is well built and fits the camera body and kit lens perfectly. There's about an inch of room with the 20mm pancake lens on it. It can fit the camera + lens, spare battery, spare memory cards, and lens caps just fine. When I travel I'd have to carry the charger and 2nd lens separately but that's fine.It's well built, sturdy, and perfect for what I want to use it for. Get one if you're looking to tote your micro four thirds camera around!"
3,Too small for a rather small camcorder,This bag is not designed for what I would call a rather average to small camcorder (Canon ZR65). It would be a nice bag otherwise. If you have one of those new itsy bitsy camcorders then perhaps this bag is for you.
5,Perfect bag for my camcorder,I don't know how you can go wrong with this bag. A friend told me how good and reasonably priced Lowepro bags were. He was right! Look no further. Camera bags have always been overpriced profit centers for camera stores. Lowepro has broken that mold.
3,Woman Police Academy...,"Sibelle Hu is appointed to organize an all-women police squad in this Hong Kong girls with guns action-comedy take on ""Police Academy"". Her regimen is harsh, yet she earns the girls' respect when a male cadet vs. female cadet tournament ensues, with the women coming up victorious. Fang, the leader of the men's squad then falls for Sibelle, and they eventually find themselves on the same mission. On their very first assignment, they wind up bound and gagged by diamond robbers, until Sibelle takes care of business. All in all a mindless action flick."
3,Fun but silly...,"This is a light, slapstick comedy in ""Police Academy"" style. Sibelle Hu stars as tough-as-nails police academy sergeant is chosen to lead an all-girl police academy team known as the 'female commandos.' While at first the girls seem to be failing to become a cohesive team, Hu's vigilance, and the girls own work-ethic soon persevere, and the Female Commandos become a force to reckon with.I really liked Inspector Wears Skirts, but it was neither a serious or sophisticated flick...It is what it is... A Chinese kung-fu slapstick movie, taken in this vein, it was pretty funny.This is the first in a series of ""Inspector"" films. If you like, slapstick cop films, you'll like this one. The only thing I DIDN'T like about this movie was the rather abrupt ending and the poor subtitles."
2,Must Read,"This gun is very realistic and feels very sturdy. Fast Shipping. However, unless you can read japanese, I wouldn't bother with this gun. It appears the instructions were translated to English via Google. Also, I could not figure out how the battery fits. So, unless you're fluent in Japanese and have a lot of time, this gun probably isn't for you."
1,"Great gun, short life.",When i first got it it was awesome. about a month later the battery died.Do not buy this gun.
1,save your money,"This gun is not worth your money, I bought this a while back and its complete Shit. Don't be sold on the fact that it has all these cool attachments because their all cheap and eventually break. Besides all that you shouldn't even think about buying anything that has to do with airsplat as their the worst retailer even and are renown for shipping broken or wrong items."
2,DO NOT GET THIS GUN!!!!!!!,"What ever you do,do not get this gun!!! The attachments make the gun look cool but the gun is mainly all plastic. I did not even have it for 1 whole day and it broke!! What you should really do is just save your money."
4,very good but...,"The gun for starters is awesome. It is by far the best gun I have ever owned shoots fast, hard, and it is sturdy.. now about that grenade launcher it is terrible the thing for starters shoots only 1 bullet at a time and u need to chock every shot. personally I think it is a waste of plastic (which it is made of) the rest of the gun is almost all metal. plus the grenade launcher broke the first day I got it. back to the gun...It is a very good deal so I would find the gun by its self with out the grenade launcher so it saves you about $30 thanks for reading"
4,Over all good gun,"Well the Hicap mag doesnt work but i herd that already so just keep that in mind the grenade launcher isn't all that great either, i don't see myself using it that often so definitely don't buy this for the grenade launcher, but the gun looks great, its heavy on the hands which is good, gives it a more realistic feel, the regular 50 mag works fine and the power is amazing (compared to my last gun) its definitely at least 300fps (.12g bb's). Its a little tough putting some stuff together but it didn't take me to long, recommend you buying more Mags with it"
5,I am getting this gun again,I got this gun for Christmas and it was real i suggest this to any one. (expect my freinds) This gun is so good i got back stabed by my team and it was both teams VS me i stayed alive for 1 hour after that i only lost cause i ran out of ammo. I am getting this gun agian cause mine broke i think it shorted out while i was playing in the rain Iwas dumb. The only problem i had with the Gun was the attachments for the greande luancher my front holder broke but no biggie i superglued it back also i hated the Greande luncher it Blows and is a pain to put togather but its the only way i could get the gun to work. Get it its a really amazing deal for the money.
3,HELP?!,When I try to use my hi-cap magazine the bbs don't come out.Anybody know how I can fix this? Thanks
4,Good gun,I got this gun for christmas. I was really happy i got a clip a few clips with it but some did not fit the hole was in the back and it was suppose to be in the front. I have 2 problems with it one it was hard to put to gather. took about 3 hours. Second the shotgun stinks it goes about 8 feet other then that its Great.
2,alright but magazine sucks,the gun itself worked fine but the high-cap mag that came with it didn't even work. I had to send it back and needed repared. would not buy again or recomend to anybody because it caused to much stress trying to get it to work. spent the last three months trying to get it to work. even when we did get it back it still didn't work and we had to fix it our selves. the pump style grenade launcher is over rated not that good.
1,short life for this gun,"this is a pretty bad gun, about a week ago I first got it. I charged it up for the 7 hours it said to, shot real good. Then I waited for the battery to die. Then I charged it up again for 8 hours. It shot pretty well, but kind of lasted for a short time then the battery died. Then once again I charged it, not once has it shot a BB, I have recharged it 5 times now, and only the first two times it worked. Not only this but out of all the ammo the launcher holds mine only shot twice, then it stopped shotting a single BB.UNLESS YOU LIKE TO WASTE MONEY, DON'T BUY THIS GUN."
1,Junk,Garbage. It came broke and very hard to return. Again Amazon did not reply to my e/m for help as they DO NOT stand behind their venders.
3,Just Okay!,"I got it for my grandson. He is 14, but needed help from his grandpa because all it showed was pictures on how to put it together. It was made in China. For the price, I thought it would be a bit better."
3,ok gun,"if u r buying this gun for the grenade launcher do not because i bought it thinking it was a nice scatter shot grenade launcher bought its only like a shot gun and it holds the battery it is like 260 fps and and more when the battery is full also when i got it i i used it for a little while then one side of the batery broke off it still works fine but its a pain 2 put in if this happens hot glue will work fine and u might also want 2 buy a new battery just for back up also one of the clips is a hicap and the other isnt so i would say buy more hicap mags if u play 1/2 hour games and u also need big things of bbs it can go though around 5000 in one day,even more but this is a good gun for playing in back yards not in pro places also the trigger jams some times just swich 2 auto for a sec then swich back in all its a ok gun"
1,P.O.S,"This thing blows big dusty donkey balls. It came in about a week. I get it the stock is broken. Then i try to use it and the motor quits as soon as i put a charged battery in. It sucks do not buy it. The ""Grenade Launcher"" or as it should be called the shotgun. Is half decent. The gun is a piece i got it yesturday afternoon and threw it away last night. I had the gun for 4 hours before i threw it away. Don't waste your money. Go to a real airsoft site and get a real airsoft gun."
4,very good,i bought this gun when it was for $60 dollars but i can see why they raised the price because this is a very good gun. i have had this gun for 3 months now used it near every day and only the tactical r.i.s rails have broke but are easily fixable with some super glue. both clips are metal and the iron sights have some metal in them to. it is strongly suggested to buy some more clips because this gun has a very high rate of fire. do not buy this gun if you want the grenade launcher because it sucks. this gun shoots much harder than 260 with .20 i clocked it at 301-305 fps. in conlusion this should be classified as a middle class gun not a lpeg
2,Great for a week...,"I bought this gun and it was in great condition, it was very powerful, for an airsoft gun. In a week, this is what broke on my gun:1. Tip of gun2. Battery holder3. Grenade Launcher and clip.4. The magazine (but it comes with two)5. It stopped shooting6. It got jammed with one bullet, got it out though.7. The safety lever8. The stock"
4,Teen Loves Rifle - Poor Assembly Directions,"My son loves this new airsoft rifle & accessories now that we've figured it out. The direction booklet that comes with it did not match up with the parts received. If you try to assemble it using the provided directions you will lose your mind! We used U-Tube vids and trial and error to figure it out. Once you do, it's great for battles! Some of the plastic has cracked so we used electrical tape to bind it up. Good bb speed and power for the price."
1,Piece of junk,"The first couple of times my son shot it, it was great. Everything worked like a charm. He was only able to use it in two airsoft fights, because after that, the trigger broke. WHY WOULD ANYONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND MAKE A GUN WITH A PLASTIC TRIGGER!? He took it over to his friends house and they created a trigger made out of strong aluminum. They put it in there, then tried it again. Then, because the gears are plastic as well as a the gearbox itself, they screwed up. The gearbox cracked, the gears stripped each other and the gun was gone. (Yes, they did put it back together correctly, they are both very good at electronics)HUGE waste of money. I will not ever buy a Boyi gun again."
4,its okay,"Nice gun! very, very, very difficult to assemble!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!grenade launcher doesn't go 10 feet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!battery takes forever to charge!!12 hours!!!!!!! (battery goes in FAKE laser)"
3,REALLY??!!!,I bought this thing and it took forever to ship. Then when I got it it broke. So i made them think it came in the mail broken (so it was a free replacement). It took one month to get that fixed and shipped back. The instructions are poop. There worthless and confusing. the grenade launcher only shoots one bullet then it has to be pumped. the gun is good once you get through all the chaos tho. Its also at a very good price I recomend it if youre patient.
3,The problem solver,"This gun is weird.The sling- I guessed and made a decent sling out of the parts provided.The instruction manual- throw it away. it's uselessthe Battery- can be stored in the silencer, the ""grenade launcher"" or the ""RIS flashlight"" that is really just a battery compartment.The Foregrip- useless, not stableThe ""grenade launcher""- like a really bad 7 round springer pistol. It's attachment was poorly designed and it doesn't stay on mineThe stocks- an M16 stock and an M4 stock. cute but pointlessThe silencer part thing- can either be the RIS thing OR the handguards. I prefer the handguards cause they are more stable. doesn't matter, but changing them out isn't easy. There is a little tick mark on one side, and that side has to go in front. more later........"
1,DONT BUY,Don't waste your money or time on this gun I pulled straight out of the box attached the battery and loaded a clip. I shot 3 or 4 times semi automatic then moved to full auto it shot 4 more times then wouldn't fire anymore. I tried fixing the trigger system and the chambering system but to no avail. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
1,pice of @#$*,this gun shots straight and is strong but its realeasy to break and it only stayes in one pice for a month it is also very flimsy. i do NOT recmend it.
2,If you skip this gun you are not missing anything.,"I should probably say that I only shot this gun once, because after that one time the trigger broke (of course I used 3 mags, each refilled, for a total of 300 bb's or thereabouts). Yes. The trigger. Very frustrating. It shot alright, but it lacks the distance and range you might want (after all, it is an LPEG (Low-powered-electric-gun). The barrel also wobbled a bit, but this was greatly reduced by adding the grenade launcher, which is a pain to attach.I can not recommend this gun in good conscious. It looks incredible, shoots average, but is too unreliable and fragile to use with confidence.Also, the shipping was awful. Avoid Hot Import Toys. The other reviews weren't lying about them. Took forever."
2,Really sucked,This gun is $100 the manufacturing plants are probably making 1000% on this the PLASTIC IS CHEAP AND CRACKS the battery is a pain in the backside to put in and it is not worth $100. I thought oh I'm a beginner plastic will be fine. Hell no if you're spending money save and get something that will last. Such as a metal product. Piece of shit!
3,ok at first,i got the gun for what i thought was a great price. Soon after i got it just about everything started to break;Pros:*it is realistic and looks cool*it is fairly cheap compared to other agesCons:*grenade launcher broke within the first 30 minutes*the fore grip did not work*the rail system broke within the first day*fps is terrible* is not accurate farther than 10 feet* way over priced for what it is*came with a lot of useless attachments*most if the stuff on it does not work very wellIn the end i would maybe recommend this gun to beginners but only the version that does not come with the grenade launcher and other attachments. Still there are much better guns out there for about the same price
1,Worst gun ever,This gun is terrible I recieved this gun on July 19 and it broke 2 days later . I own a spring m16 a4 that still works and I have had it almost a year. Take my advice and do not buy from airsplat because when I tried to send it back it would cost 50 bucks to send it back so I ended up throwing it away. This gun was a waste of time and money. I think you should save up your money and buy a bolt action sniper rifle. If I could I would give this gun negitive 100000 stars
1,THIS IS A P.O.S.,This gun comes with a manual written in japaniese to start out with. Very un user freindly which doesnt even matter anyways cause you cant put it together cause he doesnt give you the right parts. I suggest that whoever is stupid enough to buy this after my review demand their money back like me.
1,bad,the service suckedi baught this gun and amazon sold it on me to someone elseand i had to talk to some one who barely new english to get my money back
5,great gun!!!!!!!!,this gun shoots great i timed it and its more around 290 fps with .12 bb's the grenade launcher works if u no how to use it u just have to aim up a little overall great gun
4,Very Good but you need patience,"This product has alot of things to install, some of which you might not know how to at first. You need a lot of patience to build, making sure to follow instructions. The finished product is awesome."
3,ok gun,this was an okay gun with fast fire rate medium range and okay power but the gearwill strip very easily but this gun is ok for a beginer
3,Run!!!!!!!!!,"Ack, this book is dull. It is very thorough, excellent research, meticulous detail on the subject. But the subject is deadly boring. It is about New York City's desire and complications in building the sewers in the nineteenth century. It talks of political leaders, complications in getting the sewers contructed, what kind of pipe was most effective and on and on and on. It is a quick read though and easy to understand."
4,Excellent for its time!!!!!!,"This movie is very impressive for the time that it was made.The directing and plot is very evenly paced.The creature FX is unreal and makes for a great horror film. The story which involves the release of an ancient demon builds a strong plot which keeps you on the edge of your seat.Additionally, the background scenery promotes an erie glimpse of Ireland which makes for an interesting backdrop for the movie.I am an avid collector of horror movies and definitely reccomend this one for anyone's collection to be shown at any halloween gathering."
4,Rawhead Rex was both fun and scary.,"It was a good movie, but the make-up was not the best for a horror film. There are some great shots in the film. It looks very creepy and horrifying. The best part of the film takes place in a trailer park. That is where the horror is at its peak. This is one of the best horror films in the last twenty years. Don't watch it alone, you will not be able to sleep."
4,I have a real soft spot for this movie,"In life there are 2 types of good horror film. There's the deliberately creepy that has you wondering what'll scare you next and there're the films that are so spectacularly cheesy that you find yourself wondering 'Did they actually pay people to make this film or were they just on day release from some programme?'.I want to say that this film was creepy, scary and intimidating, but I can't. It is truely dire. I'll ignore the special effects (if you've seen the film and don't remember them, there were some, honest, at a stretch) and just mention on of my favorite scenes. In it, the monster, who looks like something that the production department at a really dire school play would reject as too cheep and tacky, manages to pull a woman through a car window and whip her blouse off at the same time. Maybe I'm easily pleased but way to go monster!If you're a horror film buff, trust me, you'll never see anything quite like this film ever again."
4,Much more here than meets the eye.,"If you haven't seen this movie at least three times, then you just haven't seen it at all. There is a dark undercurrent that runs freely throughout ""Rawhead"",slowly but surely bubbling up to the soul of the viewer, exposing his deepest, most primal fear to the person least able to deal with it--the viewer himself. If you are only able to see with your eyes, ""Rawhead"" will be a disappointment. If you have the ability to see through the windows to the soul, you will find something of value. This is a five-star movie with special-effects that cost it one star."
1,Can't believe the price for this movie.,"I have been wondering why anyone would pay over 70.00 to 180.00 for Rawhead Rex? Don't get me wrong I love this movie and the story in Books of Blood...I have been looking for this movie for a long time to add to my collection and after checking a lot of web sites I found the movie and it only cost me 13.00. It is a rare copy and hard to find print,but yet again for people to be charging as much as they are for just a movie I find that ridiculous....if I were to really spend that amount it had better be signed by Clive Barker and incased in gold."
1,uninformed,"I felt that I should have been informed tht the dvd i was recieving, as a present for my father, was a burnned version of the dvd, and not the original version with DVD and case."
2,"Ridiculous trash, yet strangely compelling.....","Very, very funny film (intentionally so?) is marred by dull stretches, yet overall, it manages to satisfy. Not really scary, yet there are scenes of such shocking vulgarity that fans of the genre will be pleased. I'm not sure the film warrants a purchase on DVD (how sharp does a terrible film really need to be?), but it does require at least one viewing in order to see how truly outrageous it is."
5,Stunning,"I saw reviews for this EVERYWHERE saying Rex looked""fake"". So untrue. While he is not the best, he is betterthan somethings. It has better effects than Frankenstien, but people LOVE that film. But look past this one. All you have to do to like this film is pay attenion to the story. It is true, this film would have been better if they used the 15 piece Rawhead Rex suit(and Barker's orignal script) they intended to use, but it is still pretty scary. Any true horror fan must see this film.(Also, for more Rawhead Rex facts, read Clive Barker's Shadows in Eden. I highly recommend it!)"
3,Good for entertainment value,"Before any die-hard Barker fans watch this movie, be warned that it is NOT a faithful adaptation of the story. The author wasn't allowed on set, and many changes were done to his story. As a result, Barker tried to get his name removed from the project.Despite that rather foreboding idea, the movie isn't bad as far as bad movies go. The storyline tends to blather on and it honestly feels like it's a short story stretched out to make a longer story. I recommend it for schlock fans, but anyone looking for a real scare will be dissapointed."
5,Terrific & Terrifying,"This film grabs you and doesn't let go, the evil entity in this one is truly something to be afraid of. This film made me jump - that is something none of the Halloween or Scream movies did! I recommend highly."
4,Earlier Clive film touches primal nerve,"Clive Barker's script to ""Rawhead Rex"" elevates an otherwise pedestrian horror-thriller. Why? Because of Barker's instinctive understanding was what's REALLY scary: not the Rawhead (in his ridiculous costume), but the underlying pagan and pre-Christian imagery. Notice that this is a ""Green Man"" production -- the most potent, the most potentially pervasive of all pre-Christian images. I also liked the close-ups of the tombstones in the Irish church yard ... again, reflecting that uneasy alliance between Celtic (or even pre-Celtic) gods and Catholicism. It's a theme that Barker should return to some day ... but with a bigger budget (and better actors!)"
1,did not even play,"I bought this DVD as a gift and when it was opened and put into the DVD player nothing..error..no movie, no nothing. Since it took so long to arrive and then was wrapped and given as a gift, then a few days passed before my grandson tried to watch it, he had thrown away the box. So NO movie."
3,Great Creature not so good story,"Rawhead Rex! Hmmm let's see, I would recommend this film. The monster was great but the story was pretty weak. The story takes place in Ireland and there is some beautiful scenes but in truth it is pretty bad, but HOW CAN YOU ""NOT"" SEE A MOVIE CALLED RAWHEAD REX? I don't own this DVD, but I will buy it one day when I have a few bucks to waste just to have in my collection. The best thing about Rawhead Rex is the title. Go to the video store pick up the box and look at the back, if it has the same picture on the back that I saw it will tell you everything you need to know."
1,really a dissapointment,"I saw the movie a couple of years ago, and it was horrible ( not in a way you expect if you rent a horror movie). After watching for about an hour i gave up and rewinded the tape. Nothing happend till then so go figure."
1,0 Stars for CHEESEHEAD REX,"This film is 100% trash,just look at this stupid Irish film. The character Rex look like a kids toy,and whats with all the use of claymation. Terrible movie form start to finish and grainy picture quality make this movie worthless. Even Pumpkinhead looked more realistic than this which isn't saying much. I would say skip this cheesy trash and get a horror movie not a horrible movie."
1,D#*CKHEAD REX,A real snoozer from the Irish about a goofy demon Rex. He looks like a puppet dinosaur. Worst production I've seen in years.
2,Handmade? More like Ho-Hum,"Halloween plus Handmade usually equals my kind of book, but this isn't it. Nothing featured even caught my attention in this run-of-the-mill Halloween how-to. The three chapters presented focus on haunting up your house, making jack o'lanterns, and preparing costumes. I was really disappointed in the crafts featured (luminarias, tissue paper ghosts, cutout garlands...) and the costume suggestions were worn out even when this book was published in 1999 (a red riding hood cape, a witch, skeleton on a sweatsuit...)Save your money and find something a little more inspiring likeBethany Lowe's Folk Art HalloweenorHalloween: The Best of Martha Stewart Living."
3,Best Witches,"First I start with what I did like in the book and that was the decorations,wether it was for keepsakes or temperarely projects,they are nice and fun to do.The recepies however were not halloween minded enough to my liking and of the 18 recepies there was only 1 with picture.Surely as this is a book ""full"" of ideas they could have shared more ideas on how to present the food.Plenty of pictures though of the costumes wich I found very childish.Granted,they are childrens costumes but they lacked imaganation I thought.It's a shame that there aren't any costumeideas for adults in the book.There's a great book on my bookshelf about decorating your house for halloween and that is 'Halloween decorating'by Arts & Crafts for Home Decorating.Its less childish than Handmade Halloween.ISBN 0-86573-415-1.It was rewarded with the Benjamin Franklin Award and is clearly the best book on Halloween crafts I have yet seen."
4,There can be only ONE,"I hate reviews like this -- I prefer reviews from people who have actually USED the product. However, my dismay at finding only ONE hanger in the package propels me to write this.This looks like a nice enough hook, but read VERY CAREFULLY the description and find that although this item is described as hangerS (plural) there is only one hanger in the package.Buy two and you'll actually be able to hang something. Buy one, and you have a very tiny walking cane. Or abstract art."
4,"Nice Charm, Weak Link","I loved this little sandal charm! It was dangling nicely on my Italian charm bracelet, until one day, I looked down, and it was gone! Apparently, it got hung up on my clothing, and it broke the gold looking chain. I felt blessed to find it again, So I know that it was the round bead at the end of the chain that broke off. Funny thing, is that I did not know when it broke, I just looked down & found that it was gone. I must find a better way to hold the charm on the bracelet. Know that it's cute, but I'm giving it 4 stars because the chain broke, and I almost lost it."
4,Essential sewing room item,"I had a diferent brand before, and it broke within 1 week. this one is sturdier, the quality is good for the price, i love it. The hemming marker is very useful"
3,review,"The only issues I have are 1) At times the pins end up having the sticking material from inside the mannequin and therefore cant be used again (unless you can scrub off the glue). 2) height is too short, the mannequin can only be adjusted to a shorter size from about 5'4"" (so you can't really use the hem attachment feature unless you are making a short dress!) Otherwise, it helpful to have especially compared to other adjustable dressforms out there"
4,Not Bad,"It took a little while to set up, but overall I haven't had any major problems with it as yet. I wish the instructions were more detailed and better written, but between my daughter and I we figured out how to get this thing working. The piece on the side (I think it's for the hem) I'm still trying to figure out. I also noticed that I still have to have my daughter try on the outfit before sewing it to be sure it is a good fit. The first one we tried on here still needed a small adjustment even though the measurements were correct. I think that has more to do with shape and I will probably look at buying the padding that can be applied to the dress form to make it more accurately resemble the body of the person.Overall, it has been useful as a holding spot for the pieces of clothing as I sew. It helps me get the skirt off the table while I work on the bodice. Fitting...still playing with it, but so far, it seems to be going okay. I'm glad I bought this product."
4,Great dressform,"I sew only for myself and wanted a form that would help with fitting; we all know that can be a challenge. After reading as much as I could online about various forms I felt this would be the best choice and fit in my budget. It was what I expected for the money and will more than serve my needs. I do wish we had the option of putting it on wheels. I have not tested the hem marker but the wheels to adjust the size worked fine, just have to remember to follow the instructions on which ones to do in order. I did buy the Fabulous Fit pads to go with this and I think I have a relatively close fit to my size. With the pads and the form I will be able to go up in size if I have a need. This is NOT a professional form and I did not expect it be but it is a great addition to my sewing room."
2,Bought and Gave Away,"I bought this Dritz dress form three years ago. It lasted through two uses, and then the plastic adjustable pieces stripped. Totally unusable from that point on. Luckily I live in San Francisco, and my sidewalk is like a portal for unwanted stuff... put it on the curb and ten minutes later it was gone. I have no idea why this dress form is so expensive on Amazon...it normally retails for around $90. Save your money and buy something more expensive, with metal parts."
4,It's what I needed,"It's fine for everyday home seamstress dressmaking. Like others have said, its not super duper quality, could have used less plastic parts, but overall it works. And the pads (buy separately) really help you customize the fit."
3,:),"this is exactly what i need at this moment! its not as sturdy as i thought it would be, but it works well."
3,"Not great, but will work for me","I have started making clothes for myself and needed a way to avoid being stuck by pins during the fitting process. This dress form helps a great deal. It is rather flimsy, but it is fine for an amateur sewer like me."
4,"Good flavor, consistency, good value","After reading the reviews, some said they were rock hard, they are not, .. they are nice and crunchy. Wasabi flavor is strong, a bit stronger than other canned brands.HAve some good jars to put them in."
5,"thank you for yor help, it fix my oddysey","all was very good, it fit my car well thank you for your help. will take note you if nee any more"
2,Dear Mr Vizard,"Please write a book about something other than American engines, there is life outside of the US - especially back here in the UK where you came from!One day you might discover something modern like a turbo or a 4 valve head to conquer and write about.That aside I am a massive fan of your work and have been for many years.Yours despairingly,MC"
5,hook assortment,these hooks were great for organizing my garage I used all the pieces and forn them very useful
4,Good content,"This was good for my daughter who is entering middle school. I haven't read the entire book, but it has been intriguiging for her and I browsed several of the topics and was pleasantly surprised, I.e how to talk to your parents."
1,"Don't bother, if you're actually looking for Pure Celtic Chillout","This is probably the most disappointing CD purchase I've ever made.I bought this set, hoping for a nice set of Celtic CD's I could pop in and Chill out to. Unfortunately, the CD's are actually not Celtic Chill Music in any traditional (or non-traditional) sense. In reality, what this collection is is a series of well known, multi-genre songs ( from ""Tears in Heaven"" to ""Orinoco Flow""), turned into low-budget MIDI sequences using Celtic Instruments. So unless you'd like to hear ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" performed by a computer-generated fiddle, I think you'd be best to skip this CD and find yourself some real Celtic music."
3,Not enamored of this one.......,Usually enjoy leigh greenwood's books. This book had an excellent beginning and wonderful last chapter but bogged down in the middle by redundant 'contemplation' by our lead marina.I get bored when they regurgitate the same issues over and over.The characters themselves were great and the writing wonderful. I skimmed a lot in the middle chapters so that let out the 5 rating.......it's your call........
3,Second entry in THE COWBOYS,"Love didn't last between Marina Scott and her new husband, Dr. Ward Dillon, after his vicious mother's lies began. Ward left for the Civil War while Marina was banished from her family home. Now seven years later, Marina tracks down Ward for a divorce. She wishes to marry her deceased cousin's husband to give her son, Ward's son, a father. She also wants to protect the boy from Ramon, Ward's self-centered brother. Marina must work through feelings of betrayal and fear of loving Ward before they can reunite.Not as engrossing as JAKE, but still a good story. The ending was a bit incomplete, hinting that Ward's family is returning again to cause trouble."
1,Just someone trying to cash in on the Kindle,"$29? Is that joke? I only tried the sample which is supposed to be the first chapter but it's not the complete first chapter. You get an introduction and a list of Graham's events and a few pages of chapter 1 which starts out in Florida. Writing is not good at all, rather plain and boring. The conversion to the Kindle format was really bad. Somehow they selected an off font making it very hard to read.I wouldn't buy it for $10 let alone $29."
3,An Elaborate Plot of Deception,"Catherine Saylor is a San Francisco detective with twelve years experience as a private investigator and ten years experience practicing Aikido. She is contacted by bank executive Daniel Martin who fears his bank's vulnerable computer system may be ripe for a $5,000,000 theft by missing key employee James Mendoza.Catherine thinks the key to the mystery has its origin somewhere in the army experiences of Mendoza and his buddies in Vietnam. While tracking Mendoza to his hiding place in Colorado, she uncovers an elaborate plot of deception and the identity of the real villain."
3,Pretty Funny,"I am a big Alan Arkin fan. I had never seen this movie but I thought it was pretty good. It is dated and the comedy is pretty tame even though it involves infidelity and sex. But Arkin is still hilarious as he is constantly splashing on cologne and washing the fish smell off his hands from where he works. Also just the concept of him secreting away to his moms house and trying to have an affair is funny.Again, this movie is relatively tame but I enjoyed it. Good light humor."
4,Delightful,Alan Arkin was wonderful as Barney Cashman. The women were terrific as his three attempts at seduction. One of Neil Simon's jewels.
2,ridiculous - and frankly icky,"The beginning of this book was pretty good - but that just made it's downward spiral all the more painful.I got extremely tired of Brenda's never-ending self-doubt, her mothers 'defiant' public displays of affection with her son's (18 year younger) best friend (I'm sorry, that was just icky and not well done of them - and it's not that the woman is the one old enough to be the others parent. It would be just as inappropriate if it were their father with the daughters best friend) and her obnoxious boss Tony. I wanted to throw the book out somewhere around that horrible scene on the boat - how much dysfunctional, childish behavior do you really want to spend your time reading about?If half the size, this book may have been a cute read. As it is it's a long drawn out farce."
4,The title intrigued me.....,"I picked this up due to the title and front cover, to read on a business trip. I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed this book from cover to cover! Brenda Scott made me laugh, cry and want to shout out ""you go girl""! I felt like I was part of the story from the very beginning and couldn't wait to get home and find other books written by this Author!"
5,Keeping inflation down was actually causing deflation,"His theory points out the government measurement of the state of economy was done with missing key components which are the sources of new economy drivers: digialization. The monetary policy derived from the missing measurement, digital deflation effects, would lead to a bad policy. Indication of low inflation was actually ""deflation"". Graham Tanaka has an excellent insight!Everyone should read this book."
1,Inflation is too Low,"- LaRouche's 1983 Warning -In the EIR's Oct. 4, 1983 edition, an article by Richard Freeman reported that the Federal Reserve, in collusion with the BLS, had been concocting such fraudulent factors, and using them to overstate production levels, while the BLS understated inflation, since 1967.According to examples gleaned by EIR research at that time, one could conclude ""that the real inflation rate since 1967, could have been one-third to one-half higher, or double, the `official' rate reported.""In a half-hour TV campaign broadcast on ABC-TV Feb. 4, 1984, Presidential candidate LaRouche presented the Quality Adjustment Factor hoax, plus another called the ""Production Adjustment Factor."" LaRouche stated that he and EIR had determined that the rate of inflation in 1983 had been faked by as much as three times--and should have been reported as three times higher than the official figures."
4,Ladies' Choice,"Great CD, though not Paul Tayloresque. I bought the CD because of the title song, which is jammin!! However, I was a bit disappointed with the amount of vocals, which seems to overshadow Paul's extradordinary talent."
5,Smooth jazz fan,"All I have to say is that Paul came PHAT on this one. I have all his cd's but I do beleive this one is my favorite. Terry Dexter and LoToya London just picked up a new fan, they have beautiful voices and I can't leave out Ms. Regina Belle. Wow is all I have to say. Tha sisthaz are definitley loving this cd."
5,cheap guitar mounts,I used three of these as cheap guitar mounts. They work really well. You can spend $20 a pop on guitar mounts or you can just buy these babies.I predrilled the hole through drywall into a stud. I screwed in the mount by hand and it locks in there very well. I installed two of these and put a bass guitar in them and it holds it very well.
1,Comes up short,"The DVD, I thought, would cover an in depth look at the history of the Brothers Four. Unfortunately, it only interviewed Bob Flick and only highlighted some basic topics of the Brothers Four. No other members were interviewed. It would have been nice to see all the original members of the Brothers Four. For the most part, the DVD was pretty much dry of anything interesting. I also noticed that it copied many of the video segments that were on the Kingston Trio DVD ""50 Years of Havin' Fun."" (Probably to be used as a filler.) The Trio DVD was far more informative than the Brothers Four DVD. As a fan of the sixties folk groups I wanted to see more Brothers Four on this DVD, much more...."
4,Interesting Film,"Can get contrasty. Too much so, sometimes. Very ""steely"" metalic quality - hard to describe. I didn't care for it at first but it really grows on you. Has a look unto itself. Not like Tri-X, not like TMax. Amazon will probably choke this review but B&H sells it for about $2.75 a roll in 120, making it one of the least expensive medium format black and white films not made in China. Whoever set Amazon's price on this one - and they're usually pretty good, must have been drinkin' Dektol."
4,An excellent mystery and character driven book,"This was the first Blanche book I've come across. There aren't many mystery series I've followed (R.Macdonald, Moseley, Muller), but I have to add another to the list. The pace, mood and writing style are excellent. BarbaraNeely has no problems in introducing interesting characters people may find unsympathetic. Even seemingly minor incidents are important to the story as a whole. This series, and the writer, are well worth following."
1,Unpractical,"I was unable to get into these characters and the mystery took too long to appear. Maybe next time, Blanche can keep my interest, however, I put this one down after the first few chapters, I lost patience."
3,Not so Tidy,"Any book with the wonderful Balnche White can't be all bad; and the mystery is well done. But this book doesn't live up to the Talented Tenth or On the Lam. The characters are too predictable, and their Republican sentiments too broadly charicatured. This would have been a much better book if the people in it had been rotten, but rotten with a reason, not just a politically correct despicability. I'm looking forward to the fourth book in the series, and hope for an upturn."
1,Disappointing,"I've read and liked the other Blanche books but found this one to be a real disappointment. The plot was fairly predictable and not especially entertaining. The gratuitous sex (pedophilia, bestiality, adultery, teen pregnancy, homosexuality, and a visit to an S & M club all in a two week time span) was a little extreme. I'm not sure what point Ms. Neely was trying to make but hopefully she will ""cleanup up"" her next book..."
5,Breaking barriers and taboos,"This is my first Barbara Neely book and as I was thoroughly enjoying it I was ever aware that there are many more boudaries being pushed back in genre fiction such as this than in main stream fiction which has become so self-observing that I am put in mind of the tail-swallowing snake. Barbara Neely, you are a brilliant writer and observer and I will look forward to meeting up with Blanche again really soon Thanks"
2,don't buy,"Mine came damaged, not running above a crawl. When I sought service, the shop they sent me too said, ""we don't work on that sh....t"". After a call to the vice president of sales by Swisher the local shop repaired it. It goes through belts very quickly but will cut anything."
3,Swisher,"The customer support is great, but it is to bad I had to use them the day I bought it. No instructions on how to put the machine together. Then I had/have a problem with the mower.Swisher told me how to bypass a saftey feature to get the machine to run.. Have not reset the bypass since I need the mower. Not thrilled about having to run it this way."
3,Good information,"No graphics/images throughout 99% of the book, but some decent meals. A bit outdated, but not bad."
2,Wireless has too much static,"We previously had a wired intercom that hooked into the phone line. That cheapo thing worked great for 6 years in a busy coffee shop, we could always hear each other. This new wireless one sucks, there is so much static when you try to talk to someone that you can't understand the other person. And you sound like a dork always repeating yourself, asking- what did you say? Something about bananas and advertising? Huh? Also, when the machines are going and there is noise in the cafe, forget it, you can't hear a thing. Now we just open the back door & yell upstairs!"
1,sucks,These have too much static to hear anything on them.Supposed to work at over 500 ft but cant get them to work at 20 ft.
3,tricky product,"Bought this intercom system as a gift for my parents. They have tried many configurations throughout the house / workshop, but get interference regardless. Static feedback no matter what. Kept the item too long to return, but Dad was hopeful he could work something out. He is a Mr. Fix It, so he thought he would be able to make it work somehow. Disappointed..."
2,poor range performance,"I purchased this intercom to put in my young son's room that was directly above my bedroom to ease his mind of being on a different floor than me due to a recent shuffle of bedrooms. I was disappointed with the range of the device, straight line 25 feet apart with no obstacles they wouldn't work at all. under 20 feet was ok. Through the ceiling/floor distance at about 15 feet they barely work. Not impressed with the range performance at all."
3,Short story collection by feminist author,"These are a collection of short stories from feminist author Elizabeth A. Lynn, author of numerous science fiction and fantasy novels."
2,NOVI WI-2C 2-Channel FM Wireless Intercom,"Purchased for my pre-teen grandchildren (they picked it out), they told me it is just ""okay"", nothing special, and possibly worth about half of what I paid for it. W. B. Goetz, Lemoyne, Pa"
2,Westinghouse home-office intercom,"I set up the intercom in my home office and basement shop. It worked fine for only one use. When we attempted it the next day, it would not work. I reviewed the instructions and tried different locations, to no avail. It apparently was a complete waste of my money."
3,Westinghouse cordless intercom,Does not always work for 2 way conversation: one way always worked. We are little upset about this inferior performance.
1,NOT WORKING,"The device i bought is not working at all. The power is on and the buttons work fine, but it doesn't communicate with each other. I'm returning it."
1,Would have been great had it worked,"Was so excited to get this product for my dad for Christmas, only to have him open it and find out one of the units did not work."
1,WASTE of time! disappointed with Amazon1,"I recently bought some intercoms on Ebay that proved to be worthless .They were used ones that supposedly worked pefectly.Well they did not work at all,so I thought I would buy some new ones.I found some on Amazon that were brand new in box and reasonably priced.When I received them ,I immediately plugged them in .NOTHING,not even a crackle or sputter!Sent them back."
3,"Sometimes works, sometimes not","I had a pair for 2-3 years that worked fine, then one inexplicably stopped working. I assumed it had died and bought a new pair. For some reason they also wouldn't work on the wall plug and circuit they had worked on for 2-3 years. After paying an electrician to completely rewire the circuit it worked again, but he doesn't know why. On another circuit it worked one day and not the next. Westinghouse's explanation as to when they won't work does not include my conditions and they were little help. Save the money and install a real intercom system."
1,DONT BUY HERE!,"The product does not work at all. Since I bought and gave it as a gift for Christmas, original packaging has been discarded, so company will not refund or replace the item. Even manufacturer will not replace since I did not buy direct from Westinghouse- Never again will I deal with these sellers; they are not concerned with customer service, satisfaction or proper work ethics - only their profits from selling defective items. I am furious that I was taken advantage of this way! Do NOT do business with them if you value your time and money. And yes, I have contacted them numerous times, but all I get is non-working hyperlinks to follow to supposedly information on how to get my exchange, not refund."
3,operations,I was looking for an intercom device which would allow my wife (sleeping in one room) to contact me during the night (sleeping in another room) if she needed assistance. The NovI WI equipment was not acceptable - there was a lot of noise on the system when it was not in use: it might have been caused by the path of the signal coming close to the path of the wireless interconnect between my PC and laptop. Even when we were transmitting it still was noisy.
1,Thanks to all who reviewed this product.,"My thanks to all who reviewed this product. I'll look at other manufacturers. Evidently Westinghouse isn't very interested in selling a dependable product. So, I'll vote with my feet, and walk away."
2,don't waste your time on this,"I purchased this from elsewhere. I tried getting it to work, but unfortunately it didn't work in my townhouse. If i placed the units too close, it would give loud feed back. Any outlet further apart, it wouldn't work. In short, i packed it and returned it the next day. What surprises me though, is the fact that there is no decent intercom available in the market at a reasonable price. i finally had to settle for Uniden cordless phones. They have separate intercom button and you can use it as a phone too! At least they work!"
2,Pretty Good,"I purchased it and enjoyed it for the time I had it. The only problems were the fact it did not allow batteries and the fact it had a stupid lock button on it. It should not be used for a doorbell intercom, nor should be used outside your house, or even IN an office.*Works Great*Not For Me..."
1,Do not buy! Manufacturer misrepresents product!,This and other products like it are NOT wireless. They work over your building's electrical wires. Somebody should force them to take them off the market. Do not be ripped off by the misrepresented product description.
4,Everything Firebird,"The book is probably the most complete coverage of the Firebird line that is available at this time. Several books cover the Firebird up to the 2000 model year, but this is the first to include 2002. This is a first edition, and it does contain some errors; i.e. erroneous engine data, 2 photos were incorrect for the model year they represented, etc. All small details that are easily outweighed by the quality of the photos and text. Excellent job detailing the differences and all the anniversary models. Also contains production numbers, values, etc. Highly recommended to anyone who loves Firebirds. I own a 2000 WS6 Formula and consider this required reading!"
4,Pontiac's Longest Running Muscle Car,"This is a very good guide to the illustrious Pontiac Firebird. Having owned two versions of the original 1967 Firebird, I found this to be a nostalgic examination of one of my favorite sports cars.The photographs in this text are really well done. Many of the unusual versions of this great car illustrated. There are great little tips for someone looking to invest in one of these fine rides. The book is worth the money."
4,Informative,"Bought it for my husband. He wanted it for information about the line up of cars. I found a few inaccuracies in it but that's to be expected is a document as detailed as this is. I did learn some details about some specific model years and production changes that I wasn't formerly aware of. Overall, worth the purchase and the read if you want to increase your knowledge about Firebirds."
3,Old mystery and newspapers,"This mystery has courtrooms and newspapers, a fast talking reporter and a a nice puzzle. The killer, when discovered, is a real surprise. The writing is modest but good."
1,disappointing,"Admittedly, these wedge downspout screens did catch anything that could've clogged down inside my downspouts. Unfortunately, they also caught little bits of debris that normally wash down and out of the downspouts; and the self-cleaning feature never manifested.These screens clogged more than the downspouts alone ever did: all my gutters started overflowing every couple weeks (including gutters that had never been a problem before), so I was up a ladder cleaning them every couple weeks, and this was just in the springtime. I did keep trying for a couple months, but after that I took them out, and have been much happier without them."
2,Wedge Downspout Screens,"When I ordered these, I didn't realize that they would be so cheap and flimsy. I carefully put them together and dropped them in my down spouts. I had a little bit of difficulty in getting them into the downspout holes of the gutter. They are working so far, but I really wouldn't recommend them. They are a cheap thin piece of plastic."
3,"Phallus in Wonderland - Sick, Tragic, and True","GWAR, the reigning kings of Shock Rock, did it again with this parody of the United States and crack cocaine. The video, although devoid of any plot or content, shocks you again with images of everything taboo. Kids eating crack with thier cereal, a deformed penis, and a montley cast of characters sum up this true vision of shock rock by my friend and your friend, GWAR. This is a must see for all you ""freaks"" (of which I participate part-time) and fanatical GWAR fans. This should not be viewed by anyone with a heart condition or weak stomach"
2,Eh.,"I love GWAR but I thought this video was pretty weak. I've watched it like 3 times, and I usually skipped the skits and watched the amazing four videos on it. Bo-ring."
4,Ehh,"im sry but if you think this band is one that nobody knows, you apparently do not live in Arizona."
4,GReAt - MonoGRAhiC - vAlUe,"Fans, just for fans,ONLY for those who had a previous approach to libeskind's work. (results as to much for first-timers) advanced desconstruction followers will feel satisfied of owning this piece. The ""plus"" comes in the writings, the way they are writen is pure and simple ""congruence"" something worth to be digested."
3,"Are they, or aren't they ?","I found the dialog between the two potential accomplices in the train was the best part of the book. The descriptions of the murders were OK, but we've read plenty of those in other books. The thing I found frustrating was the exploration of the characters. I'm still not sure whether Patricia Highsmith was trying to tell us there was homosexuality to explain the attraction between the two main characters. Did I miss something ? Personally, I don't care, but I wish she'd get on with it and let us know one way or the other. Perhaps the book is showing its age..."
5,Far more disturbing...,"...than the movie! As I recall it, the character of Bruno never develops in the movie beyond that of a randomly-met psychopath; the portrayal of Guy, for that matter, is rather limited as well. I suppose that the nature of cinema is responsible rather than any failing on the part of Hitchcock; in fact, I've always loved the movie, but the novel has a real gut-wrenching impact, particularly for any reader who has ever suffered from panic attacks. One gets much more of a sense why both major characters feel and act the way they do, and how anyone can find themselves closer to doing the unthinkable than they would ever have believed possible. An altogether harrowing vision of guilt and isolation!"
4,You'll enjoy it,"""Strangers on a train"" is not only a captivating, but also an interesting story. It is for once not the story of a detective finding a murderer or several murderers, but of two people, their characteristics, and how they commit a murder one for each other. The interesting thing about it is, that one of them, Bruno, really wants these murders done and doesn't know anything like remorse or so, and that the other one, Guy, almost gets crazy because his conscience tortures him after committing the murder, a deed done against his actual will. I found very interesting how the story was made up, how the influence of Bruno on Guy develops, gets bigger so that in the end Guy is in a conflict between fear/ fascination of Bruno and his own strong moral ideas and finally murders. The dynamic that comes up between those two people is a very interesting thing, and the story lives by that which makes it very captivating."
3,Strangers On A Train As Book And Movie,"This is Patricia Highsmith's first novel and as such it is good indicator of what an unusual novelist she would become. Many of her works demonstrate a tight structure and an economy of words, but not this one. It is peopled with too many characters not crucial to the plot. The plot is evidence of her genius for the perverse and over her writing career she would rework the main protagonists of ""Strangers on a Train"" to much greater affect such as seen in a later novel ""A Dog's Ransom"".Alfred Hitchcock had great success with the movie version of ""Strangers On A Train"" in 1952 and it is regarded by film critics as one of his best movies. Hitchcock took many elements from the book but improved on the plot vastly and made the movie very interesting visually when he changes Guy's occupation from architect to tennis player.This makes a great read when you follow up by watching the movie by the same name."
2,Not the prog band,I bought this thinking it was the Hoax's new live album released since Manholepedroza left the band. Unfortunately this is the other Hoax that usesthe same name. The Hoax from Texas was the original and far superior.
2,Save your money...,"I was very underwhelmed by this book. Not a good ""teach yourself to play bass"" book at all. Might be better if supplemented with an instructor. Did an O.K. job of covering various musical genres hence the 2 stars. But not much information on how to apply the basics learned in each chapter to a wider variety of music. Overall there are better books out there and you don't have to look too far."
2,Nice instructions for a begginer bassist,"Wouldn't recommend this book if you already have a band, or if you already have taken some lessons in bass.I got disappointed with this book. I was expecting more. But, the only nice part is that it already gives you some ideas about a base line and encourages you to write your own lines/solo by providing an already empty sheet music with the basic chords on each compass."
5,Giant Print NKJV is just what I needed!,Product is just what I needed as my vision is not as good as it used to be.
2,"NKJV is Great , Words are too Large!","The book is concordance and reference materials in this book are great and helpful. My problem is that the text is too large and crowded on the pages making it difficult to read and look up versus. Started giving me a headache after awhile. I would like to recommend the regular Nelson NKJV Reference bible. Its will be easier to read. Another great bible, the one I like the best, is the Nelsons SLIMLINE bible. Perfect to take to church because its smaller and lighter but the words are still large enough to read on a regular basis. I have the genuine leather edition and bought it on amazon and just LOVE it! Hope this helped."
5,Thunderbirds and Amazon save the day again,"The Thunderbirds flew in right on time. Good price, fast action. My son is thrilled. Thanks again Amazon."
5,Great all the way around!,"Every minute fascinating. I didn't know of the show as a kid, and thought TEAM AMERICA was an original; well....it still is.It makes me feel like a kid again, but it stands on it's own for kitch craving, as well as sci-fi fans."
3,This book is not as bad as the other review says it is.,"This book is, however, very technical. The tables I have looked at do make sense. The authors must have put a lot of effort into the writing of this book. The English seems okay and the programs look like they would work (although I have not tried them). As for the F-words, I haven't the foggiest idea what he is talking about.By the way, the tables are of formulas for calculating the coordinates of the moon. The are no tables of tabulated moon coordinates (although the programs are suposed to be able to produce them for you). I should have known that you cannot put 16000 years of tables in one book."
1,This book is the worst astronomical book I have ever seen!!!,The title of this book is very attractive. That is why I bought it. But the programs it gives in its chapter won't work. All the tables do not make sense. I doubt the English ability of the author. There are at least hundreds of run-on sentences and fragments. The author even wrote many F-words in the book. I wonder what kind of background does this author have? I will avoid any book written by this author.
4,its all naz,"no no no no no...the 'product review' for this dvd is all wrong.as quoted from the official nazareth site( www.nazarethdirect.co.uk)...River Records have just release a new DVD and CD package titled Naza live,The DVD was filmed at the Gateway Theatre in Edinburgh at the end of 1980 for STV.It is in fact the very first gig naz played with Billy Rankin and John Locke, so this was the first outing for the Nazareth ' Orchestra'.The 2nd Disc Features the Full show recorded at the Glasgow Apollo on the UK leg of the Snaz' tour in 1981,When River records put out 'The River Sessions CD' a couple of years ago, it was supposed to be the whole Apollo show but nobody could find the first reel of tape so it was put together with some Tracks from the Live in Texas show.This new release features the whole Apollo show as was meant to be."
4,Impressed,The Sirens/Murderer is a satisfyingly cheezy horror flick duo with excellent acting from the majority of the casts and superior production quality for small budget independent films. Highly recommend it for the B horror fans.
4,Fun B-movie fright fest,"""Sure, these aren't big budget Hollywood productions, but some of best movies out there are made up of good stories and a smaller budget. The Festival of Horrors DVD is a good example. One scene in Murderer is particularly gorey, but that's part of the ""fun"" when it comes to horror movies! OVerall, an enjoyable low budget movie."""
3,Great customer service,"While the item I received had it's issues, I wanted to say that the seller is awesome when it comes to customer service. He went the extra mile, offering to replace the can of paint free of charge. While the project is complete, I did want to let others know that the item I received may have been the lemon in the barrel. Spray paint no matter what kind or type, may have a tendancy to clog up. Thank you"
2,Flakes- eating red paint.,"I bought this to spray on my old dish drainer. I washed and primed like instructed. I coated and then recoated. It covered nicely, no drips or runs, and I thought things would be great. Then, I waited the 7 days to insure no flaking. For the next week I was picking red chips off of my dried dishes as I watched the dish drainer returning to white. Boo. I have since resprayed with this red (I really love my current dish drainer) and have covered that with a coat of clear. I am now in the middle of the seven day wait to try it out. The other thing was that this item was over $9 on Amazon (when I bought it), and Wal-Mart sells it for less than $5."
1,Darker color green than depicted,Purchased this spray paint for a very specific project whereas a I needed a brightish green. I couldn't find what I needed in any of the stores so I was excited when I found this particular spray paint on Amazon. I looked at the color on several screens for awhile to try and judge if it was quite what I needed. The color seemed right so I purchased it. Upon receiving the package I opened it and much to my dismay the cap was a completely darker color than depicted. I am very disappointed in this purchaseAfter comparing the product to the product picture I noticed that the cap of the product depicted online is not an actual cap. It's just the shape of a cap colored in...the wrong color.
3,Messy,"Bought two. On the first, the red plastic spray head appeared defective, not permitting easy spraying, instead dripping. Used it but a mess; glad I had glove on. The second can was better but far from quality. Paint quality good, but what a mess!"
2,Did not work like promised,I painted red over blue and the smallest scratch the red comes off and the blue shows through. I thought it would be more durable.
4,Pink spray paint,"This paint works well however it is a bit overpriced. The same paint can be had at your local home improvement store made by rustoleum for nearly half the price and the same quality. The color is very light, lighter than I expected but that's probably my own fault. Worked well in spraying a plastic and metal computer case. It dried quickly and doesn't scratch easily."
3,Defective,"I have used this brand of paint before and was very happy with the results. The can I received this time was defective. When you pressed the spray button, the paint dripped and leaked all over the place. I needed it right then, so I struggled through with gloves on, but it was definitely a messy job. As far as the paint itself though, it does cover plastic well and I have no complaints about that. If I had had more time I would've returned it and reordered, but as I said, I was at crunch time."
2,PLAYS DOWN POLISH CATHOLIC SUFFERING,"Tries to be objective, but really 'drops the ball' on under-estimating Polish-Catholic casualties,i.e., 150,000 Poles killed in Auschwitz, not the 500 mentioned, and no mention of 3 million Catholic Poles murdered in 'the ""Forgotten Holocaust."" read Richard Lukas' ""The Forgotten Holocaust."" Lukas' book fills the void left by Corona's/this book. Also a good objective read is ""Auschwitz: A History,' by Sybille Steinbacher. Suggestion: Before reading all of Steinbacher's book, start with page ""29,"" and learn something about Auschwitz you never hear about - WOW! Steinbacher's book is a small book, but has more information than the big and long books on Auschwitz. Steinbacher's book is also suitable for everyone, and is so reasonably priced ($9ish)for the abundance of well-researched info you are getting."

1,Disappointing,"Product failed to have a range over 90 ft. States it only wokrs if on the same electrical circuit , yet if you plugged it into an extension cord and moved it closer to other unit still in the same outlet then it would work... Original Novi's that i bought 8 years ago worked flawlessly in same outlets, these are far inferior........"
3,Not As Pictured,"My husband bought this panda for my collection, and it's a good quality. However, the bear itself looks more like the picture of the 10"" Manschli panda than of the one shown. So much so, I actually returned it the first time, thinking I had gotten the wrong product. So while it's very cuddly and has a face that kind of grows on you, make sure you like the other Steiff Manschli panda before you order this one, because you're just going to get a bigger version of that one."
4,Financing Sport,This book is a great source of information. I am an aspiring sport manager and I found this book to be an excellent addition to my library. I highly recommend it.
5,Ultra 31738 is an excelent product,"The enclosure comes as a kit, including the frame, two sets of cover plates, one set black and the other set blue. A padded case with velcroflap. two cables and two sets of screws. Even a tiny philips screwdriverto attach the cover plates. Also a CD with drivers for windows 98 users.Assembly was easy. Just plug in your hard drive, screw it down with thefour included screws. Snap the two cover plates on, screw them down witheight tiny screwa, using the included screwdriver and you're ready to run.My XP Pro recognized the drive without trouble. My Linux operatingsystem also recoqnized it.It does not need an external power supply. it gets its power from theUSB port. Also there is a large blue LED to show the unit is operating.I liked it so well, I bought four more, one for me and three for xmaspresents.Now I have to locate four more 2.5 inch hard drives."
3,"INTERESTING, HONEST, AND READABLE","I enjoyed the first part of the book a great deal, and the cultural storiesare nothing short of amazing. By the middle of the book I wanted to suggest that theauthor just return to Zimbabwe, however. She doesn't find Maine to be pretty andshe resents another (American) mother not wanting to watch two of her children while she has the third, a younger infant, restricting her movements at a park.In fact she pretty much struggles with not having a black woman in her home to watch and help raise her children, as she would have had in Rhodesia, apparently.Near the end, it becomes a story about dysfunctional families recycling themselves. I was hoping for more detail about life in Zimbabwe but the author seems to bepretty much oblivious to any political or human rights issues taking place there.Nonetheless, it is well-written and even intimate. It is also, however, a bit of a self-pity party and leans toward snarky about American life."
5,Moving and unforgetable . . .,. . . this moving biographical story is absorbing . . . I could not put it down . . . the story is vividly written . . . so vivid that it has become a part of my life's fabric. A must read for anyone who has any interest in understanding Africa. A must read for anyone who wants insight into their own maturation and family dynamics.
2,Average,I wasn't too thrilled with this book nor is it bad. I have read several biographies from people who grew up in Africa/still lives there but this is one that probably wouldn't be the first book I recommend to others if they have similar interests
3,Family history in entertaining style,"Yet another white ex-Rhodesian novel with a dark atmoshere, a sort of joyless, flat, doom-laden strength that characterizes the Rhodesian/ Zimbabwean experience.The story itself is relatively unspectacular, documenting the private life of a housewife who emerges from the suffocating racism of white Zimbabwe, to broaden her horizons in the west- and all the while managing to maintain a certain priveleged air.There is also the touching tragedy of a car crash, in accident-prone Africa, and a boy left without a mother.What is most interesting here I think, is the authors tremendous eye for detail. Skillfully crafted, she creates a lucid picture by weaving together scattered images, and draws meaning from apparently insignificant observations."
3,"It does the job, but buy new screws.","The rack holds my carbon fiber road bike just fine (14lb), but buy new screws. I read the previous reviews that told me to buy new ones, but didn't listen because I didn't think it would be much of a problem. The screw didn't go in all the way, and the screwdriver ruined the head of the screw so they're stuck in half way. It wobbles a ton, but still holds up the bike. I wish I had listened to the previous reviews."
3,Not the right colour.,"I did email amazon back and they did promise me that if i re ordered id get the black this time, they were prompt in responding and refunded my money back.i ended up going to HOME DEPOT...it was 5.95 for the grey one, going to end up spray painting it black lol."
4,Product as stated,"Storage rack was priced very low.. was easy to mount, needed to go buy cement screws as I was mounting on a block wall. Even though it stated the delivery times and it was delivered 2 days early, it still took 14 days?"
5,Works Well,The bike rack was delivered very timely and was easy to put up. I used a cordless drill and it only took a few minutes. It holds my bike well and keeps it out of my way. Very cost effective and keeps thing neat and out of the way.
3,Over-engineered,"The racks work as expected, but they are poorly designed for installation. For one, the brace is 4"" wide, even though it is designed to be attached to the 2"" edge of a 2""x4"". Even if you attached it to 2 sistered 2""x4"", then the screw hole is in the wrong place.More importantly, the screws are ridiculous - they are much too thick for their intended purpose and I could not get them in with either a powerful screw gun or by hand. (At the same time I installed kayak racks meant to hold more weight and the screws for those went in no problem.) I had to use my own screws. Although it works as intended, there must be a rack that is easier to install."
5,Phenomenal!,Tanya has a God-given ability to usher in the Holy Spirit to minister peace and love to all who hear. Her talent is second to none and I am blessed to have her music and friendship in my life!
5,The Value of an Iconography,"I'm surprised at the low ratings for this book. It is invaluable as a book to consult. It isn't a ""read from cover to cover"" book . It's like an encylopaedia to consult whenever one comes across an obscure reference to a rarely mentioned manifestation of some Buddha. And as near as I've been able to determine this is the only iconography of Buddhas left in print. There was an excellent one of actualy statues from places like the Forbidden City, but that was back in the '60's."
3,How to Housebreak Your Dog in 7 Days,A very thin paperback book. Not much more information that the pamphet from the Vet. Easy to read.
2,Didn't work for me,"This book had a lot of good information, but didn't work for my dog; a Min Pin. Would not buy it again. Have just used my common sense to get her housebroken when she is free in the house. But the crate method did not work at all"
1,Would give zero stars if I could.,I followed the advice in this book to the letter for my adult dog. All it did was make the problems worse. He won't even eliminate outdoors anymore. I hate this book and so do my floors.
2,Wasnt very helpful,"I am getting a new puppy, a Beagle to be exact. I am really training myself and preparing myself to be able to be the best pack leader ever. I heard good reviews on this book so I decided to get it. After reading it I didnt find it quite helpful. I am a huge fan of Cesar Milan and his whole philosophy is nose eyes and ears. I want to get my Bella trained that way so that there isnt a lot of vocal as this book suggests.If someone doesnt know what they are doing and needs some help, this book is great and its an easy read."
5,Worked Like a Charm,"We were given this book at the shelter where we adopted our 10-week old retriever mix. It gives programs for both people who are at home during the day and those who work, and also a part for older dogs. The premise is ""what goes in must come out"" and that by keeping a journal and keeping a strict feeding and watering schedule you can do a good job of anticipating when it's going to happen. The idea is if you set your puppy up for success he will succeed. The only thing we did differently was set an alarm for 2am to go out so that in the morning it wasn't such a mad dash to the door. We never had a single accident in the house and he really was trained in about 7 days."
1,Worthless and over priced,"This is a worthless little book which if I where to suggest a price for it, it would be a buck, one dollar, $1.00 and not a cent more. You can get all of the essential information for free on the net (I checked) and for the person who is responsible for putting the few words together and calling this a book, and charging $8 for those few pages (yes, it's a thin little piece), shame on you. My suggestion is to either get a better book or simply check out some resources online for free. You will get most of what is written in this book there."
2,How To Housebreak Your Dog in 7 Days,"This book would be very helpful for someone who has no clue about housebreaking. However I found the same information by using internet search engines, the keyword:housebreaking, and found more than I could read. The book did have little tid bits here and there that were good to know. Also, by the time this arrived my puppy was already housebroken. Lastly, this book is overpriced for the size and information that I already got from the internet for free!"
5,this worked for us,"we used this book seven years ago to train our mutt. we did it in conjuction with an obedience class - it really worked for us. rarely do we have a mishap (usually caused by excitement) - our dog is just amazing and we feel like this book helped. you must follow what it says - and be on top of the situation for the 7 days. getting a dog is fun, but it is work work work. you must have the time for your pet to train it. its is worthwhile and wonderful."
4,Great Book,This book is really easy to follow. I read it 3 times and did everything the book told me to but unfortunately my dog forgot to read it as well so it didn't worked for me.
4,best little book for potty traiing,If you will follow the instructions in this book you will have no trouble training your old dog or new puppy.I have used it successfully 3 times now. Workd like a charm!
2,Repetitive.,"The book is essentially a fast read about housebreaking different categories of dogs like a puppy, rescue , etc. I have not once referred back to it In all fairness, there is some good information but it was very repetitive and slight. Not worth the $6.99 I paid for it"
3,Common senses well packaged,"This book gives the most reliable approach to housetrain your puppy. If you can follow the advise, the dog will be housetrained, but probably in more days than 7.The essentials are actually quite simple and the principles can be summaries in 3 pages. Talking to someone experienced in crate-based training is probably easier."
1,Waste of money.,Complete waste of money. Said in description could be used for puppies. Bought it to speed up training for new puppy but then turns out it doesn't work with dogs under four months. Presume puppy will be well trained by then using common sense and info available on internet the same as previous dog was. Don't waste your money on this book.
2,Very basic,"If you have never owned a animal this book will be great for you. But you can get this information free by googleing how to train a dog. Not helpful for me, as I was already taking all the steps included in this book and have never owned an inside dog.Save you money and buy a breed specific book, you will enjoy it more and it will prob be cheaper!"
2,"Small, easy reading","I found a couple hints I didn't see before, but like others found the book was overpriced."
5,This is ALL you need to housetrain your pup or dog!!,"If you can make it through the first 24 hours, freedom from an unhousetrained dog will be yours! It REALLY DOES WORK! I had a dog that was a 1.5 year old, I mistakingly paper trained her first and she never stopped doing what she was taught- going inside on the paper! NOT A GOOD IDEA! A family friend recommended this book and within about twenty four hours she was house trained!!! Most people would have said that I would always have a problem with her, NO way! Two years later, she's remains PERFECTLY HOUSETRAINED! In addition to this amaziing success story, I recently loaned the book to someone who was having trouble house training her new puppy; within a few days- no problem at all! Buy it, it really is well worth the money!"
5,This Book Is Fantastic!,"This book describes why most known methods of housebreaking are ineffective and unnecessary. It describes the psychology behind the method. I trained my dog by this method and must say it worked almost too well. My dog is now 8 years old and has had an ""accident"" in the house only once in that time due to an illness. I attribute this success to the method discussed in this book as well as to the intelligence of my dog :) . I will say that the first two days are difficult, but after that the dog will understand the 'pen"". Try it, it is far less cruel than other methods."
3,"Minimal, but accurate information, overpriced","We bought this book to help potty train our new Golden Retriever puppy, Sadie Rose. If you're already familiar with housebreaking a dog, the book doesn't contain anything new. Simply control the puppy's eating and drinking schedule, and take him/her outside every hour to the same spot. The advice in the book is fine, please don't misunderstand. But it is a very tiny book, and the info can be readily found for free all over the web. This book would be fine for a couple dollars, but not for $7.99.Please be kind enough to indicate if reviews are helpful."
4,Good book,The book offers a great basic understanding and scheduling for training. The most valuable part of the book is the schedules the author offers for various working/non-working owners.
3,Good guideline,"This book was a little misleading, but is a good guideline to go by. I will definitely use the schedule for housebreaking when my puppy turns 4 months old. I had to adjust some of the info to accommodate my dog."
2,How to Housebreak Your Dog in 7 Days,"This book disappointed me. By the time I received the book, I had housebroken my puppy using the methods in the book (common sense)without even reading the book. It might help some to those who have never owned a dog before. The book is small and I think overpriced for what you get."
3,Crate training,"""The Art of Raising a Puppy"" by the New Skete Monks, who also wrote ""How to be your dogs best friend"",have a good chapter on crate training. If you're getting a new dog or puppy I recomend both books. They routinely work with ""problem"" dogs, or problems in living with dogs."
1,Total waste of money!,"I wish that I would have never purchased this book. It's a total waste of my hard earned money. My dog is over a year old, and is still not housebroken. It has silly plans in it which are supposed to fit everyone... but they don't!"
3,"Basic stuff, but helpful",This was recommended by my puppy's trainer. The schedules are very helpful and easy enough to follow or modify for your own use. My problem is that my puppy hates to be left in her crate and just cries and screams while in it. When's that book coming out?
4,Good book for puppy help,This is a good book and a quick read. It's great for new dog owners looking for a simple housebreaking techniques. Nothing earth shattering but good info.
3,A pleasant read.,"This is a re-issue, originally published in paperback in 1990. Another very pleasant tale from Betty Neels where a nice girl, Beatrice, meets a handsome doctor. It takes her the whole book to realize that she is in love with Dr.Oliver Latimer. I sometimes find it frustrating that the hero always waits so long to show his intentions, while leaving the heroine feeling all at sea. I do find that it is refreshing to occasionally read one of Betty Neels' books in contrast to the more sensual books out there today."
4,Hilltop Tryst,"back cover: When Beatrice's world turned upside down, Oliver Latimer was on hand to pick up the pieces. There was something solid and reassuring about Oliver. Beatrice felt safe with him. But he wasnt an easy person to get to know. Accompanying him on a lecture tour to Europe convinced Beatrice that there was more to Dr Latimer than she'd imagined. In fact, she came to believe he was the only man she could truly love. But Oliver kept his feelings hidden. What did he really think of her? (I liked this book. Oliver doesnt keep his feeling so hidden, Beatrice is a typical Betty Neels naive girl and their are no spoilt girlfriends which I liked!)"
1,Not for Guinea Fowl,"We got a pair of these and hung them low to the ground on both sides of our driveway. The intent was to scare our guinea fowl from walking down our driveway into the roadway (where they are invariably hit by cars). While the owls are good-looking, sturdy, etc. they do nothing to impress guinea fowl. The birds walk right by them."
4,NIGHT VISIONS: Ohh the babes!,Night Visions has more bouncing babes than two films put together. All of them are sexy all of them represent a different period in time. The movie is very erotic and also has an interesting story. But the babes! Ohh those babes!
1,Very Deceptive,I bought this DVD after seeing so many perfect reviews. I must say that this is the worst erotica DVD in world history. The filming is extremely poor. The actors seem very amateur. I'm beginning to think that the other reviewers are actually the sellers. A little research on the net will back up my review.
5,Finally!,"Let me start by stating that I rarely write reviews. I feel like I really need to write about this stuff, though. I'm in my early 30's and had recently resigned to never having nice skin. Enter MyChelle Dermaceuticals. My skin is looking SO much better!! Between this and the pumpkin cream, my skin is almost 100% improved. I'd tried Proactiv, which was okay but stained everything- sheets, shirts, towels, the lot. I used Oil of Olay, and still do sometimes, but the daily facial wipes were just getting too expensive to use twice a day and I still had forehead bumps. Honestly, with the money I've spent on trying to find the perfect fix I could have bought heaps of MyChelle! I'm not going to make this long, but please, if you're feeling bummed and lost with your skin, give this a try. Don't jump into the deep end, as it can be expensive, but get a starter kit or just a couple things and see how you go. I'm going to post the same thing for the pumpkin cream. Good luck!"
4,outstanding,"...if any of the readers are Django fans , these disc's are beyond compare. I bought them as I am a writer and instrumental music was what I was looking for as it provides the uninterrupted listening pleasure that worded music does not. My sister in law is French and a Django fan and tuned me on to him. It was one of the best musical decisions that I have made."
3,Cute Car,Bought this for a topper for the wedding cake the balloons and horse shoes came away from the car so not happy with this but over all was cute finished off the cake and a great reminder of a special day.
2,slow dialogue,"The plot appeared interesting, but I found the dialogue too slow. You read what the heroine and hero are thinking and then they say it aloud to each other. And they tend to think the same thoughts again and again and again without adding anything to the plot or character.Bordering on insanity is their lust. Right in the middle of being chased by thugs with guns, and they're climbing down the fire escape, they still have time to feel each other out and fantasize, really amazing.What also got tiring was how she kept trying to keep him out of her troubles by running away from him in the middle of being chased. When is she going to get smart enough to realize it's too late to 'keep him out of it' when they both have been id and chased already?? The book does not make her appear smart at all."
5,Great story!,I just re read this story and fell in love with it all over again. It is a quick read and a super introduction to the characters that will be starring in the other stories in this trilogy.
2,Disappointing series,I had thought this series would be both sexy and exciting. It turned out that it wasn't much of either. I got more disappointed as the series went on with basically the same thing in each.
4,The mile high club...,"After an accident which left his passenger and lover dead, pilot Noah Fisher is finally ready to fly again, and plans to get some R&R; and hopefully party with a ski bunny or two. The only hitch is that he has a stowaway -the sexy widow of one of his clients. Bailey's husband died and left her with some huge debts due to his shady investors and they are willing to kill anyone close to her to get what is rightfully due to them. As Noah helps her traipse from one incomplete property started by Allan Sinclair to another searching for the loot, the two embark on a passionate affair, much to the consternation of his friends and fellow pilots.Shalvis combines intrigue, sexy characters, and a plot twist or two to tell a romantic and sensuous story. I particularly liked the camaraderie among the three ""Sky High"" pilots and look forward to their further adventures."
4,Pretty good....but,"I liked this book as an easy, quick romp, but that is all. The suspense and adventure were lukewarm at best while the sex and passion were hot!I enjoyed reading it because it was fast paced and took little concentration. It was a good ""in-between"" book, in that it let my mind rest from the intense action and suspense of other books.If you're looking for fun, sexy and quick (Mr. Right Now, he, he) pick this one up..."
1,"por favor, no mas","This is one of those movies where the screen goes black and you sit there and say to yourself, can I get the last 2 hours of my life back? The sex scenes, if you can call them that, are repulsive and can't even distract you from the utterly mind-numbing storyline, if you can say this has one. Three words are beaten to death in this movie: papel, palabra and cover. I am saddened by Tim Robbins' decline."
2,Dull and tedious... with lots of mumbling.,"Who knew sci-fi could be this dull?Imagine someone tried to blend Blade Runner and Gattaca into one movie, but as a stylistic choice told all the actors to mumble and the author never bothered to include an actual plot. You'd have this movie.If you've ever wanted to listen to Samantha Morton drone on and on, in endless voice-over narration, then this is the movie for you. If you enjoy love stories where there's zero chemistry between the lovers, then this is the movie for you. And if you are having troubles getting to sleep, then - yes! - this is the movie for you.Dull and tedious and derivative. There's a reason you've never heard of this movie before. You've been warned...."
3,Good idea for plot but not enough to the love story.,This movie had a good plot but not enough movie and story to back it up. The love part didnt make sense. Tim Robbins' character falls in love with this ugly girl the first time he lays eyes on her so he lies to cover up her criminal activity. Then they have sex the same night after hanging out for a few hours. This movie could have been much better if they would have cast a better girl for Tim to fall in love with and made more of a love story that connected the two very different characters.
4,almost great,"If you liked ""Gattaca"","" Blade Runner"" and ""I am Legend"", then this movie would be highly recommended.The effects are not worth mentioning; they should have used different cars and different clothing; this would have made a big difference. In the meantime the dialogue and the story is all very interesting and worth your time."
3,What was this movie trying to say?,"This movie has very realistic, great-looking sets, good music, and accomplished actors. It is also rather plodding, relying on scenery to take the place of dialog, and meaningful looks to take the place of character development.And the movie's message? To me it seemed to be that the government doesn't want you to have a baby with your sister, so it is illegal. Gotta say, if I interpreted that correctly, I'm gonna have to side with the government on this one.Maybe codes 1-45 were more interesting. ;-)"
3,Code 46,"Interesting theme, but the tempo of the movie is quite slow, it drags most of the time so that it challenges the viewer to stay focused, the acting is above average though. Great to watch on a slow,cool and rainy night."
3,no birth control in 2050,"jeez, here's a solution- liason, don't breed. if the future can give you an empathy virus, learn a language through a virus, etc., they can do contraception through a virus while you want to be with the woman who is your mom's clone.nice music though, great scenery."
5,One of My Favorite Sci-Fi Films,Superb acting. Clever writing. A haunting soundtrack. This film is a piece of art. Enjoy it.
3,Needed more character development...,"Code 46 may not be the greatest or most original film I have ever seen, however it has some interesting elements. The cinemotography looks great, there are some interesinting futuristic-type ideas and music is used incredibly well, but we just don't connect with the central characters. The film somehow just doesn't seem to explore these characters enough and I was left quite cold."
2,Most Realistic Futuristic Film with not much going on,"This film portrays a world in the future that I can imagine actually happening, a world where because of cloning, an emphasis is placed on one's genetic makeup, protection is needed against viruses when travelling to a new place, and it is safer to live in the city versus ""outside."" It is comforting that despite all these worries, regulations and restrictions, fears, human emotions are still there.However, this film is much too slow paced with really not too much going on. The love story between the two main characters is not convincing at all. There are too many long close up shots of the Maria Gonzalez character that end up being more annoying and pointless rather than adding anything to the film's already skimpy plot.An alright movie that would have been better more as a half-hour show on Twilight Zone..."
1,Dreadful movie,"I like Tim Robbins a lot. Unfortunately, his talent was utterly wasted in this dreadful movie. What's so fascinating about adultery? The whole concept of people speak English with a little Chinese and Spanish thrown in is ridiculous. Stay away from this one.Your trusted reviewer, as always"
1,Simply Awful. NO GATTICA!!,"To put it bluntly, I love these types of flicks. Gattica was GREAT.Going in to this film I had high expectations as I love the actors and the plot/premise and comparrisons to gattica got my hopes up.This was simply AWFUL.Boring, not even worth wasting time reviewing, let alone watching.Those comparring it to gattica should be ASHAMED!"
2,Creating sci-fi from remnants,"Lured by Tim Robbin's taste for the offbeat ""Indie"" (e.g., Jacob's Ladder""), Code 46 offered far less than it promises. More a mood piece than science fiction, writer Boyce is not Gattaca's Niccol in his piecing together of Gattaca sprinkled with Blade Runner. Nor does Code 46 have the chilling claustrophobia of 1984.Instead, although acted well, storylines are as vague as the form of the monolithic government that enacted the code. Compared with other sci-fi that offer more holistic views of alternate realities, Winterbottom's is fractured and at times nonsensical.I am warned when, after a film, I say to my wife ""What did we just watch"". Paraphrasing Gina Davis in The Fly, be warned, be very warned."
2,Wait for weekly hire,"I got the chance to watch this movie last week, and based on Tim Robbins earlier movies, I was expecting a good story.The movie was very slow and after 40 minutes of stodgy acting, no direction and boring story, I felt compeled to turn the movie off.I won't spoil the story for those of you who do want to watch it, but for my money, there's a lot better out there to watch."
5,Nice High Quality Balancer,"This is a great prop balancer. The only thing uber minor complaint is that not all of the thumb screws are the same size. It's ok once you figure it out, but a little confusing until you do."
5,Unbeatable for balancing everything RC,"This prop balancer is so versatile, you can use it to balance props, heli rotor blades, entire heli head assemblies (blades, head, flybar), EDF fans, and even RC wheels. The balance comes unassembled, but is easy to put together. Each half of the balancer can be independantly raised or lowered, and there are two options for how closely you want the two halves to be together. I believe this is the best, all around, balancer that is on the market."
5,Dubro - Sturdy Precision,"I was impressed with the sturdy construction of the balancer. This Du-Bro 499 will provide many hours of balancing entertainment for many years. The many YouTube videos on the subject really helped, too."
4,Better than holding it between your fingers,LIke most Du-Bro products this balancer is well thought-out. It is easy to use and pretty versatile. I have used ot for both electric and giant scale props as well as large spinners.
3,Du Bro 499 Prop Balancer Poorly Machined,"This is a kit to produce a device for precisely balancing high speed model aircraft propellers. It contains eight special and six ordinary nuts intended to screw onto four threaded rods and four threaded fittings. None of them fit as furnished. It took nearly two hours to re-tap the nuts, and that was deemed easier than trying to rethread the rod and fittings with threading dies. Odd to find such imprecise parts in a precision device. Hopefully it will do its intended job, but don't expect to take it from store to flying field."
3,Glitches,Kids loved it....however the gizmos (prox sensors) for the various cool features could get messed up. Take precautions to make sure the keyboard is not manhandled by the kids.
5,hours of enjoyment,what a great productand I am truly thankful that it has a headphone jack to lessen the momments when its not as conversation freindly
4,Blueman Keyboard,"I purchased this for my 7yr old son for Christmas. Great concept, great tunes (not like those other annoying toy keyboards he's owned in the past where you just wanted to throw that thing against the wall) and he really enjoys the idea of hooking up our ipod and using the keyboard as a player. I think this keyboard is great but like every other toy he's received this Christmas (he doesn't really play with it anymore)!"
3,Litte Kids ONLY,"It's kind of cool to be able to add beats to music, but the keys on the keyboard are for small children only. If you're purchasing for a child who wants to capture the feel of playing the piano, keep looking. While the tubes and drums are nice, the small keys limit the functionality of playing the keyboards."
2,BLUE MAN GROUP,THIS WAS EXPENSIVE AND DIDN'T HOLD GRANDSONS INTEREST EVEN THOUGH HE WAS INTERESTED IN MUSIC AND THE BLUE MAN GROUP. THIS IS THE TYPE OF TOY THAT GOES IN THE CORNER A WEEK AFTER CHRISTMAS.
4,Cool twist on average keyboard,"This keyboard makes just playing around fun. Cool tube sounds and/or percussion sounds. It takes some practice to learn all the features, but it's pretty cool once you know how to use it."
5,Genius,This was a time when jazz was at its greatest with musicians that were of immense talent training and imagination.
1,Bad return policy and insufficient paperwork,Remotes do not work. THere was no return invoice or return paperwork included. Just a packing slip with no return policy displayed. After I finally got through to them (published hours of operation were not correct on packing slip) and waiting 30 minutes on hold on phone was told there was just a 14 day return policy but would try to extend it to 30 days but I was 2 days past that.So I am stuck with remotes that don't work and out over $40.00.Will not purchase anything from this company again.
4,Connections,You do not have to be on the same circuit or circuit breaker. But you do have to be on the same phase. In a residential electrical panel power comes in from the street usually with two phases - think of it as two 120 volt circuits from the street. Stuff like ovens and dryers need 240 volts - so they use both phases. Regular electrical outlets are wired to one phase. In the main breaker panel every other circuit is wired on a different phase. You will probably see something like A and B on panel drawing.
4,disappointed,"The product probably was very good---but our disappointed came from not haveing a complete discription of the limitations, ( all boxes must be connected on the same current ) which we could have found out before we ordered."
1,Don't buy it,I bought this unit to monitor my elderly parents' bedroom.Did not work AT ALL - it turned on that is all it did. I have to agree this is a peice of garbage that cost me $8 to have shipped [not through amazon] but the unit is absolute junk
1,Does not work at all,"For a 4 bedroom 2 story house, and basement, this intercom did not work at all. They have to be on the ""same circuit"" which I come to find out that homes these days mostly do not have outlets on the same circuit - but have lots of different circuits. I ordered 4 and have to return them all. They only way they worked was plugged into 2 different outlets, in the same room, on the same side of the wall - which does a lot of good if you are hard of hearing. I'm going to try the radio frequency ones - but this was a complete bust."
1,Beware!,"This was purchased to be able to easily communicate with my 91 year old father who lives downstairs. After many attempts, the only way this worked was having both units plugged in to electrical sockets in the same room. When told by Amazon that we would have to mail it back UPS to Novi, we had to pay the $25+ mailing cost. We did get credit for the intercom from Amazon, but that was all. Beware of this product."
3,Works as stated,"Works as it was advertised, although for some reason on certain outlets it would not work. Luckily the outlets in the rooms I needed it for, it does work."
3,"Half Good, Half Bad","Ordered four of the intercoms, one of which does not function at all. The other three work great of they are plugged into outlets that have no other electronic device plugged into. The range is great and they work for the two hundred feet from my horse barn to the house. These are replacement devices identical to ones installed 7 years ago, so they last. Dont know what the issue is with the one malfunctioning."
3,Good enough for my needs,This intercom is enough for the needs of a house. You have to make sure both machines are synchronized and it will work ok. It is not perfect but an easy economical way to communicate within the house.
2,Why it does not work on all receptacles,"Laura, it did not work on all receptacles because the intercom system demanded that all intercom be on the same circuit. A typical house has more than one circuit. Could be tricky if for example, the master bedroom is not on the same cicruit as the basement."
2,Hasn't worked for a while,"Briefly, I have four stations and they never really worked right, I presume because of the need to be on the same circuit. I want to replace them now but I'm not sure I'd buy this brand again."
1,Intercom System Missrepresented,"The system was advertised as working well over a 1,000 foot range. However, what was NOT told, was that both stations need to be powered by a common electrical circuit, with no extra circuit breakers or surge suppressors in between them. When I attempted to operate them in two buildings about 50 feet apart, but on seperate power sources, there was a very high level of static noise, no matter how the audio volume control was adjusted.NOVI WI-4C 4-Channel FM Wireless Intercom"
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"FOOTSTEPS IN THE DARK is a movie about an investment banker who writes mystery novels as a sideline. While doing research for his books he becomes involved with real crime as an amateur sleuth.Errol Flynn plays the light-hearted detective. Brenda Marshall is his loving wife and the rest of the cast includes Ralph Bellamy, William Frawley, Lee Patrick and Grant Mitchell.FOOTSTEPS IN THE DARK is a pleasant surprise for a low budget movie. The director is Lloyd Bacon who directed MOBY DICK starring John Barrymore in 1930. He also directed the musical 42ND STREET with the assistance of Busby Berkeley in 1933."
3,So-so screwball mystery flick,"An awkward parody of the ""Thin Man"" movies, with Errol Flynn trying out screwball comedy for a change... The set-up is that Flynn is a rich playboy who, unbeknownst to family and friends, moonlights as a writer of detective fiction. This, of course, necessitates his staying out late to do research into crime, and telling all kinds of lame fibs to his wife and shrewish mother-in-law, in order to cover his tracks. Misunderstandings and wackiness ensue. William Frawley plays the dumb cop Flynn loves to torment; Ralph Bellamy and other great character actors pop up as well. Mysteriously, the actress playing ""the other woman"" is completely unattractive: couldn't they have gotten a real starlet for the part? Guess not. Anyway, this is a pretty weak film, and doesn't really even work as a curio."
3,"Not Dynamic, but nice easy read.","I rate this book as a 3 stars because the characters were not developed as well as they should have been to make the book a more appealing read. The storyline is good, so it is overall satisfactory."
1,kass99,please do not buy this book..it was horrible how the male character in this book was nothing but a whoremonger. I can't believe norah hess had the nerve to the whore he slept with (tillie)have his son instead of lauren.. what the heck is that!This book was not romantic at all. It was about how another of ms.hess male characters are nothing but men that can not stop having sex...pass on people...I would never in real life marry no man that had a bastard son with a whore...Thank goodness this is fiction! I was disappointed in this book and mad!!!
2,Undeveloped,"This had the makings to be a good book. Too bad the weather was written about in more detail than any of the characters. I could feel the biting cold through Hess's writing that made me shiver while reading in 96 degree weather. I know Hess has the talent to make the characters pop off the page, but these had no more depth than a paper doll."
1,bad deal stay away,This beer machine leaks and is impossible to use without making a huge mess. It doesn't seal (it is broken in half right in the middle and the beer leaks out when you get a little pressure on it). I bought one for me and one for my brother and neither of us could get it to work right no matter what we did and he is an engineer. We followed instructions to the letter. This is just a poorly designed product don't buy it you will lose your money. I'm out two hundred bucks and had a mess in my fridge that took all day to clean up. Yuck!
5,Up Up And Away,This is a great hanger on which I put garden tools. It folds up out of the way when not in use. I highly recommend it.
5,Perfect for hanging a string trimmer,"I bought this specifically to hang an Echo SRM-230 string trimmer in my garage and it excels in that role. I screwed it into a stud and it works as advertised. The hooks are coated in some kind of vinyl or rubber so it won't mar your equipment. It's pretty long when extended, maybe 8""-12"", and while easily accommodate most trimmers, edgers, and blowers, as well as multiple brooms, shovels, and rakes. I definitely plan on buying more."
1,All Wet,"Grainy and incoherent, THE BATHERS follows an uninvolving group of dancers in a Parisian peep show. The girls strip, dance, bicker, strip, dance, bicker, strip, dance, bicker, and for a change of pace, shove infant formula at the baby of one girl's sister in a distinctly non-maternal manner. There's a plot, of the flimsiest sort, concerning a paroled convict who's convinced, for no particular reason, one druggy dancer is his missing daughter -- cue for a series of scenes involving adult toys, familial recrimination and and turgid dialogue. The transfer's indifferent, but somehow that hardly matter here. Even the most devoted fan of French slice-of-life films will find this epic tough sledding."
5,Chant Masterpieces,"This CD is the ultimate chant disc. It combines chant with pipe-organ, and the combination is fantastic. The organ is strictly a background to the singing but adds an immense amount to the listening experience. I have several traditional chant CD's but this one is by far the best. The mood of a Medieval Gothic monastery is very effectively re-created! The production is excellent with the original recording done in 1959/60. A very nice two-disc set with inner booklet in multiple languages."
5,a priceless purchase,"this is a MUST for any violinist who is serious about playing the violin. This book has solution to all of the problems that a violinist faces, in addition, this is a great leaning tool, lines from major concertos are used as exemples. again, this book is a must for anyone who's serious about playing the violin or even becoming a concert soloist."
4,Ban the Rays,"As their name suggests, the Ray Ban Predator 2 sunglasses offer terrific eye protection, comfort and style. They are very comfortable and offer a very clear site lines as well as great coverage from the sides. I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend these sunglasses to anyone."
1,Not a quality product,"The glove arrived damaged. The web was ripped in twoplaces. This exposed the inner material it was made of, and it sure didn't look like leather. Not the Wilson quality of old. On the positive side, the return and refund was extremely fast and easy withAMAZON.Com."
4,Ukulele : In Notatio Abd Tabkature,"This book is a great book for intermediate players, shows you how to tune the ukelele easily, shows you some great strumming methods, and is an easy reader. The only thing holding this book back from a 5 star rating is that it did not provide information on how to play certain chords, otherwise it is the ideal book and great for an intermediate ukelele player."
5,"Poor choice of title ,there is nothing ""beginner"" about it.",Hot selection of Salsa dance tracks.This UK label has great salsa compilations.I plan to get every salsa title on Nascente and the defunct UK Charly that I can find.The UK CD Mastering and pressing of Nascente's CDs is superb.The sound quality is audiophile .Compare the sound to any USA Fania CD and you will be amazed.
1,Worst tires ever,"I wish you could give a rating of Zero starts for these tires. My wife purchased these for her 2002 Honda Civic. We live in Bloomington, IN so we get our experience of diverse weather. She spun out on wet pavement making a right hand turn going five m.p.h. a block away from our apartment. At this point the tires had around 500 miles on them. I drove her car after she backed into a hitch and broke out her tail light a couple of weeks ago. This happened because she couldn't get traction in an inch of snow in parking lot. My car with Michelin Pilot Sport AS walked through it like it was nothing. I spent literally five minutes backing out and pulling out of the parking lot. These are hands down the worst tires I have ever driven on. They are like hockey pucks in cold weather and the worst tires I have ever driven on in the rain. DO NOT PURCHASE THESE TIRES!!!!"
3,"Solid unit, but not without it's problems","Gardena builds a solid and durable sprinkler. I give them their dues. However, this unit is rated at ""up to"" 3800 square feet and doesn't even get close, at least not with the water pressure in El Paso, Tx. It also rounds off the corners so much that I need to hand water them. Even the cheapo Gilmour oscillating sprinkler I had been using does a better job of watering the corners of a rectangular area.I'd still recommend the Gardena Aquazoom, but only if you're watering an area considerably less than it's rating. It applies water very evenly, and other than the issue with the corners, doesn't create any dry spots or flooded areas at the edge of the watering zone."
5,Still one of the better Mauls,"It's sad that after all these years this figure is one of the better Darth Mauls around. It's an oldie (from around 1999), but stands well and has a fair number of dramatic poses. While the cape and hood are plastic, they're quite detailed and look like flowing robes. Not a bad figure if you want a hooded Maul. The mini-Sith Infiltrator is a great bonus."
4,A great buy,"My only complaint would be the lack of high profile matches. Sure, those may be available on previous dvds, but previous dvd's have a tendency to be difficult to track down.I'd have loved to have seen newer matches added to previous selections, perhaps Shawn's personal picks, the picks of his peers.... Just something higher profile than a bunch of AWA matches, Raw matches, non televised matches, or follow-ups to big PPV shows w/o the same high profile implications.How can you have a DVD featuring the ICON, the SHOWSTOPER, and MR. WRESTLEMANIA w/o a single Wrestlemania match on any of the 3 dvds.Regardless, this was a very entertaining collection. Michaels has earned a reputation over the years. Some of it good, some bad, but disc 1 of this set gives you a lot of perspective on what Shawn dealt with throughout all phases of his long career.A great story, pretty good matches, and a must have."
5,Luv Shawn Michaels,"Big fan of Shawn Michaels.Luv the set recommend for all his fans.Truelly a must have.Luv Shawn love the set.He's so awesome love watching him.Thank you,Sheila L. Lance"
3,A nice condense version of his career,"Much like all the other Shawn Michaels videos out there, this one does an excellent job of handling his career. Different is the fact this one is more updated, and does a better job at really looked over his career as a whole. Now that he's officially retired, except a new 4 disc to probably come out soon showing everything he's accomplished."
5,Very Good Collection,"Very good collections of Shawn's matches. Good DVD, impossible to get all of his classic matches into one single collection!"
3,GOT THIS FOR MY DAUGTHER WHO IS A BIG FAN..,She just loves wrestling and especially this wrestler. So she enjoyed this dvd very much.
5,Great reference,"We brought along a copy of this book for our recent visit with our three-and-a-half-year-old. It was a life-saver! The book had several wonderful suggestions that made our trip one to remember. Of particular interest was our visit to La Ronde, Parc Omega and the Biodome. It pays to call ahead to places just to make sure the information (hours and days of operation) is current. Great reference - we are definitely going to use other books in the series for future trips."
2,Nope,This has information you can gather on your own with nothing new to offer presentation wise. I was looking for an interesting way to present this information to my students. This wasn't it.
5,Nice Bibles,I bought several of these bibles for my Sunday School classroom. The bibles are attractive and reasonable priced. The bibles we had were not the same version as the curriculum and were falling apart so I expect happy children this fall!
3,It kinda worked...,"We used this on a dinged up Volvo. It made some of the dents less noticeable but took many tries and was for the most part frustrating, especially given the results."
5,Did exactly what it said.,"I had to do it twicw, but it saved me costly repairs where my kids dented my brand new van with a baseball!"
1,Glue fails to stick to puller,"Followed all instructions, but glue detached from puller tab too soon & no force could be applied to pull out the dent. It stuck moderately well to the car finish, but it is useless if it detaches from the tab first with little pressure. Placed a call to the service number, the recording promised a callback within 15 minutes - but two days & several calls later, still no contact, still no solution. This is a great concept, if it could be made to work."
2,not quite nude lifeguard babes,"Interesting premise to interview actresses who've appeared in Baywatch or other tv shows, even if briefly. The interviews are interspersed with video of what looks like it could have been a photo shoot for a magazine spread -- the girls are posing in a variety of ways, eventually bare their breasts, but seldom (actually only one) get completely nude. If you're looking for skin, you can probably make a better choce"
4,a must have coffetable book,"If you are connected with Philmont, if you love western history, or if you are interested in Northeasten New Mexico, then this is a must-own book. It is in a coffetable type of format, so it makes a great book to set around and peruse whenever you have a few minutes to relax. As the title indicates, it is a brief history, so the text doesn't get nearly as detailed as Larry Murphy's book ""Philmont: A History of New Mexico's Cimarron Country."" Instead Zimmer and Walker's book is loaded with great photographs. If you are looking for a good historical review of Northeastern New Mexico, but don't want to get bored with details, I highly recommend this book."
5,Just Incredible,"La última niebla es una de esas novelas que, a pesar de los años transcurridos desde su publicación, sigue impactando a las personas- que no son pocas- que tienen el placer de leerla. Fascinante obra, donde los sueños y la realidad llegan a confundirse como nunca antes se ha hecho."
3,Universal Principles of Design,"I'm afraid this book didn't quite live up to my (high) expectations, which was to learn something new and practical. The book is well done and contains good references, but the descriptions of the ""principles"" (none of which were completely new to me) are a bit superficial, IMHO."
5,Great design characteristics book,"This well written reference to design characteristics. I has good descriptions of the characteristic, examples, and graphics. I got it to apply to user interface design, but it applies to any design field. I would recommend this along side the Tufte books."
5,Designer must have - This book is never far from my reach,"This book is never far from my reach. I get asked lots of basic design questions to which I'd like to provide accurate answers. When I'm at a loss for how to explain a design principle, I just reach for this handy guide. I have a Bachelors degree in fine art, so flipping through this book is like a college refresher course. If you're new to design or want to learn the basics, this book is an excellent place to start. It's also worth keeping handy as a reference.The great thing about this book is that each principle is explained as its own short, illustrated chapter. Each chapter is a two-page spread so you can quickly learn new principles. The illustrations are simple and assist in making each principle clear and easy to understand. There are 100 principles (or chapters), so there is very little that's not covered in the book."
5,Universal Principles of Design,"Universal Principles of Design is an accessible addition to design understanding. The information has been distilled into a consistent and clear format that allows key design principles to be quickly appreciated. It is the product of a considerable research endeavour; references sources are quoted allowing further exploration of the principles. The graphics and format, as to be expected in a book design of principles, makes delving into this book an enjoyable experience. I just wish I had a copy of this book as a student, many years ago, but you are never too old to learn and experience new ideas and perhaps reinforce design concepts that you have known for a long time."
5,Applies to more than graphic design,"This book is a tremendous book. While I think the target audince of this book are graphic artists it is useful for any industry or occupation. As an IT professional, the techniques offered in this book helped me design better interfaces for software systems.Great book"
3,Worked great for college class,This is a good overall book. It was required for my college class. I have enjoyed learning about all different ways to present written information
4,Fun to read & great presentation,"This book was fun and quite addictive! It contains a collection of unrelated design principles that can be browsed and read in random order. The presentation is very attractive. Can be recommended not only to marketers and designers, but also to anybody merely remotely interested in this topic.The weakness is that there is no attempt to create a frame work, overall guidance, or step-by-step advice on how to combine these principles."
5,Tremendous value,"What's great about this book is it's organization and brevity. The authors articulate the design concepts in clear manner and supply concrete examples (on opposing pages) to add weight and understanding to the written explanation. Furthermore all concepts are linked to the canonical papers from which they come as well as the more modern advances in the field.It's a book your feel comfortable trusting.A design book that takes the additional care to give the audience a conceptual table of contents (of concepts grouped by type) *as well as* an alphabetical table of contents is the type of book that is, well...Well designed."
4,Great photos overshadow lacking text,"I managed to get an autographed copy of this book last year, and I have to say the photos and illustrations in this book are fabulous, although some more text would have been nice. Oksana takes the ""reader"" into the backstage world of ice shows, competitions, shows how a costume is made, and even has pictures of herself as a child....but she has such an interesting/inspirational life story something more along the lines of a biography would have been more interesting. All in all, it's a very attractive book and I give it a solid 7."
3,Photographs: Terrific! Text: Not so terrific...,"If you like photographs of skaters and skating, then this is your kind of book. If you want to read about the sport then this isn't the book for you. I got the feeling that the writers of this book got so caught up in trying to be ""hip"" that the text and the point of this book was sadly forgotten."
4,good flag for college,"I bought this flag for my college apartment. It is a good product except it needs to be delicately ironed (out of the packaging) to remove the fold marks, other that that it is worth it."
5,Great addition to any college dorm/ apartment,Got this baby sitting over the bar in my apartment and have receive a lot of complements on it. the flag is made of the same material as most of the cheap flag on amazon.
1,I have not recieved it,"I did not get my idem, I hope i get it soon, or i will write an even worse review ."
3,"Fantastic perspective on history, workaday style","The stories told here are eminently intriguing in their evocation of another era, an era when nothing mattered except bigger and more of everything. No matter what toll it took on the masses of workers who gave their time, health and very often their lives in the achievement of these dreams. Our collective memory of these times is in danger of being lost forever; this book goes a long way towards preventing such a loss.Personally I didn't find the prose to be of a very high calibre. Ms. Cadbury may be spreading herself thin; a first-class editor would have been a definite asset. The structure of the book is not overly sophisticated either. It kind of feels like a laundry list of events; the introduction has the feeling of a student's paper in its preview of the items to be covered in the book.But there is no denying the importance and fascination of the stories, and for that it is definitely worth a read."
5,Ms Cadbury is a wonderful writer,"Ms Cadbury is a wonderful writer. Her prose is clean and clear. I had read the McCullough books on the Panama Canal and theBrooklyn Bridge, and this gave me a basis to appreciate what a fine job she did on condensing these two topics.So many history books are about politics or war, which I find boring, but the history of people actually doing something to make life better makes a great read.I bought her Terrible Lizards, and I am looking forward to it."
3,life jacket,these are adequate for my use. We ordered the largest size and they are really too small for an adult of normal weight.
4,Seems to work well.,"It has a high degree of adjustability which is good. Fortunately, I've haven't had a chance to use it ""in anger"", but it seems like it would do the job."
1,Oversized is probably not accurate,I don't see how this is oversized. It looks like any other regualr sized jacket. Big people may want to go mega-sized if they make them. It barely comes down to my lower ribcage. I have a 50 inch chest. 62 inch max??? I want a picture of that.
4,"Stearns, Adult, General Purpose Life Vest",Needed a vest for use with a kayak and for a minimal cost got a vest that is comfortable and easy to use with the kayak.
3,"Works in water, quality built","I have one of these life jackets, and it's definitely a quility built life jacket. I tested it by jumping into the lake one day, even though I cannot swim. Sure enough it supported me in the water without any trouble. If general safety is your only purpose in looking for a life jacket, this one is a safe bet.Comfort varies with this jacket. While they are more comfortable than less expensive life jackets, they are not particularly comfortable during rowing. The life jacket has a tendency to slip up from my waist during rows, even with a secure fit. If you're just spectating in boat and not doing anything, however, this jacket does just fine.Alternatives to this around the same price is Cabela's Full Motion Vest. It allows more freedom of movement during rowing, and is much more comfortable."
3,good product,"there is nothing wrong with this vest. good quality, good material.the size is bigger than I thought. Size M actually too big for my husband who wears size M for most of his clothes."
3,Classic caper,"This cult classic has an unsatisfactory first half, but boasts a spectacularly entertaining, and justly famous, second half. The patchy script has Michael Caine heading up a heist in Turin with the help of jailed criminal mastermind Noel Coward, in a welcome cameo. As the heist itself gets under way, director Peter Collinson delivers first-class thrills with a cheeky sense of humour. The production is lensed brilliantly by veteran cinematographer Douglas Slocombe, best known, perhaps, for the Ealing comedies of the 1940s and '50s; his presence here reinforces the sense of Britishness with which the film has become associated."
3,"Decent heist film, but nothing special",A decent enough heist film with good automobile stuntwork but the humor seldom hits home and the punchline at the end was never set up and so falls flat.
