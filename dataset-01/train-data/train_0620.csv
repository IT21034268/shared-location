5,Cordless razor,This was a gift to my boyfriend. He couldn't wait to try it. He loves it. It works great! I would recommend this product.
5,Wahl Trimmer,The Wahl Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer was received right on time. It is just as portrayed on line. My husband is very happy with it. It works beautifully.We would recommend it to anyone looking for a good servicable trimmer.
4,"Good purchase, as expected",I bought this unit primarily based on the reviews in Amazon.com. The price was reasonable and I was replacing a previous unit that had simply worn out from years of use. The only complaint that I have/had is that the clip that you slide on and that adjust up and down to adjust the length of the trim was difficult to get on and given it is plastic I fear will break some day. So far has worked great but I worry that this part may break. For 15 [...] or so I would recommend this unit.
2,So-so,"I am not sure how this trimmer got so many 5-star reviews, because it's performance is sub-par and it feels very, VERY cheap. It pulls hair all the time, takes a lot of passes to make an even-looking trim due to narrow size and crappy plastic adjustment heads. The only reason it got a second star is because it is only $15, and I guess one has to adjust expectations accordingly."
3,Wahl B&M Trimmer,"So far, so good. The plastic accoutrements that attach are pretty stiff, and I wonder how long they will last, as I take them off and put them on repeatedly. But hey, now that I have my trimmer, I'm a good bit handsomer, and my visage is no longer that of a big old lion."
5,Can't believe the product for the cheap price.,The construction of the trimmer is stlightly on the cheap side but it still has a decent feel to it. I love using batteries now instead of recharging. It has a very strong motor and does a great job of getting the job done. I only payed $18 so I think I definitely got my moneys worth.
4,Cumbersome Accesories,The Trimmer works fine but the various sizing attachments are cumbersome and even potentially dangerous to attach. The tabletop holder is neat and looks nice beside other bathroom accessories.
2,Trimmer guards work poorly unless you like it very short.,"The trimmer guards work poorly by design unless you like your beard/goatee very short. It all depends on the angle at which you hold the thing. Mess up and you chop your hair off close, regardless of the alleged guard length. I am returning this product. Too bad, nice quality otherwise. Just need a better guard design."
2,"Works OK, but Poor Quality","Works OK, but as other reviewers have mentioned, the power switch is a POS. I can get it to work by holding the switch constantly, but for how long?"
4,Very Good,After using this product I found that it was actually better than I expected.At this time I must give it a four star rating.
4,Happy with product,Cuts great- I am happy overall- blades are difficult to adjust - but I guess that means that they stay in place better...
2,Too loud to use for ears,"It is really too loud to use on ears, and to have a separate clipper just for this purpose doesn't make sense to me."
1,Not Hot,"Gave this as a gift to my husband for Christmas. He no longer has a beard. It did not TRIM his beard and mustache. It made his beard NON-EXISTENT, and he didn't even dare to try it on the mustache. It's COLD here, and now he will definitely be COLDER STILL as he works outside all winter. NOT RECOMMENDED."
1,I should have read the poor reviews.,"Installing batteries is a frustrating chore, because the compartment is too small, which also causes the lid to keep popping off. Also, the product was completely covered with smudge marks."
1,Shoddy product,"This product was returned because of shoddy construction,e.g., recommended batteries wouldn't fit, handle cover came off repeatedly and could not be closed."
2,"Sadly, you get what you pay for...","The attachments were not manufactured well. When placed on the trimmer, they are so tight, they are nearly impossible to get off. I can't remove them with my hand but have to pry them off. And of course that means that I broke one as soon as I removed it.Nearly the entire trimmer is made of plastic, so I guess I don't expect the rest of it will last long either. I guess this is one of those cases where you get what you pay for."
1,Does not work at all!!!,I could not get the trimmer to work. I tested the batteries in a flashlight thinking they might be dead. They work fine. I'm not sure how to return the product & I'm thinking I'd just like to get my money back on this one. I do not like returning things. Too much hassle & time!
3,You get what you pay for,The blades get hot rather quickly even though I clean and oil after every use. The adjustable guard is cheap and does not lock very well resulting in bald spots if you are not extremely careful. Battery cover is lose after a couple of uses and it drains my rechargeable and lithium batteries like a GameGear. It is fairly loud for something so small. The logo rubbed off after I oiled it the other day.
4,"Good value, good replacement","Had a previous model for MANY years. This one seems just as good. Nicer fit in your hand, lots of tools, including lubricating oil (which I never used on the old one). Only complaint is that the adjustable head tool is a little hard to get on and off. But I would definitely recommend it."
1,unacceptably loud,"As another reviewer noted, this trimmer is too loud. I feel like it would damage my hearing if I continued using it. Also, one of the attachments broke the first day I received it.Do not buy this."
1,Wahl - Not,"I bought this Wahl trimmer, coz of lots of attachment. But when I installed the battery, it didn'twork. So I have to return it."
3,Poor quality attachments,I had a Wahl beard trimmer for 12 years till I dropped it. I purchased this to replace the one I broke. The unit itself seems to work fine. The attachment for the beard is very flimsy and I can see how it would be easy to break. It goes on hard and you have to twist it to get it off. Not sure how long it will last. Fortunately I kept the beard attachment from the one I broke and it's very well made. It also works great on this unit. Easy on easy off. Not sure what they were thinking but then again it's very inexpensive and it's 12 years later. New and improved???
2,Not up to par,"I was very disappointed with this trimmer. It arrived with several of the cutting teeth broken off which resulted in a painful trim as it attempted to rip hair where the broken teeth were rather than cut it.It is also very loud, and the multi-height trim guard makes it very hard to get a consistent trim height.As other people have noted before, it is also very hard to get the trim heads on or off.I've gone back to the simple Philips Norelco G370 since I like their multi-height trim head much better.On the bright side amazon refunded my money without even making me send it back."
4,The Wahl Trimmer,"i love this trimmer. It really works like the other people says it does and for the price, you can't beat it."
4,Nice little trimmer,"Works good, doesn't pull hair, easy to use. The finishing of the plastic body is a bit crude but that doesn't affect the performance of the trimmer. Works on 2 AA batteries so no need to worry about electric points, cord lengths, recharging etc. Very convenient. no complaints."
5,Solid and Sizzlin',"After hearing Full Moon, Fire on The Mountain, Million Mile Reflections, and many more Charlie Daniels Band albums, I have to say this is my favorite. It's the kind of album you could leave on repeat and it just flows. It's the perfect mix of fast and slow songs. Guitar harmonies and fast fiddle action make this a gem. While this is some great music for taking road trips, drinking, and shooting pool, I'm not so sure I understand what previous comments regarding Charlie hoping this album goes away are all about. I personally e-mailed Charlie regarding this and he said he never made such comments. While he is more active in sharing his beliefs today, this music tells me he found God years ago. This soulful hill-billy rock and blues is not created. It's inspired. You do not know Charlie until you bought this album."
4,It's 1975 and if you missed it you will want this album,This album starts off with Texas a rocking fiddle song about the lone star state. Charlie performed this tune in Urban Cowboy staring John Travolta. Willie Jones is one of my favorite Charlie Daniels ballads. In this story two men become great friends while one was a gaurd and the other serving time. Willie Jones attemps to escape the gaurd has him in his sights but shots over his head. This cd is worth it just for this song! Tom Crain is a new addition to the CDB on this album and contributes Franklin Limestone.
4,EGYPTIAN ARCHITECTURE BOOK,"I had to do a report on the subject and this book proved extremely useful... I recommend it without hesitation. Very, very detailed.."
4,*~* She's one in a million*~*,"This is still one of my favorite albums of all time. I still listen to it even though it's a couple of years old. All the songs in this album are good thanks to the production and lyrics from timbaland and missy elliot. Aaliyah was a strong and beautiful woman with a great personality who always remain the same.The hit singles from this album include: If your girl only knew, One in a million, 4-page letter, Hot like fire (remix), and The one I gave my heart to. All of these songs are well-writen and have a unique beat done by timbaland. However, The one I gave my hear to, is a strong ballad showing Aaliyah's potential as a true artist.Along with these songs my favorites include: A gril like you, Everything's gonna be alright, I gotcha' back, ladies in da house, and heartbroken. From beginning to end this album provides hits for everyone to enjoy"
5,She's Got It Goin' On!,"I don't know if there will ever be an album as good as ONE IN A MILLION. Missy Elliot & Timbalane give phat drum beats & Great Lyrics to exercise Aaliyah's tender/low, yet powerful voice. It may not be as strong as the likes of Monica, but it has more depth & soul than Brandy's. Aaliyah proves that she'll rule the R&B world with her next album. All I can say is that she's ""One In A Million."""
5,I love Aaliyah and I love R&B,"Aaliyah is an incredible singer with an unbelievable beautiful voice, and she also looks beautiful! would get in touch to R&B-Fans"
5,YO AALIYAH RIGHT HERE YO,AALIYAH IS PHAT BUT WHATCH OUT GIRL IAM IAM THE ALBUM MY GROUP ALBUM IN STORES ONLY IN CANADA BUTT DAAMM YOUR FINE I WISH SOME DAY WE MEAT AND DO A SONG TOGETHER MY NAME IS CHOICE BUTTT IM IN THE GROUP DUBMATIQUE MY BROTHER IS IN IAM CHECK IT OUT LOVE YOU!IM A FRENCH RAPPER
5,Read This NOW!!!,"If you have never heard Aaliyah's music before this is the album to get cuz it is by far the best along with Aaliyah[self-titled album]. Worth buying twice!Intro: best damn intro. [i always play it early in the morning to wake me up]""One in a million"", ""Heartbroken"", ""The one i gave my heart to"", ""4 Page Letter"", ""Never comin'back"", ""Giving you more"" and ""Got to give it up"" are the best tracks. all amount to 10/10Track 7: ""Got to Give it Up"" is a Marvin Gaye cover using MJ's 'Billie Jean' beat = great combo!! despite what Kiran Rajagopalan says about it. Definately a high ranking track [minus maybe the begining of it] feat. Slick Rick.Outro: dangest ending."
3,I liked her first one better...,"This CD has some great song on it, but most of them I just skip right over.These are the tracks that are worth listing to, the rest I just skip over.2. Hot Like Fire3. One in a Million - One of my all time favorite songs5. If Your Girl Only Knew6. Choosey Lover (Old School/New School)7. Got to Give It Up8. 4 Page Letter - Another stand out Aaliyah track.9. Everything's Gonna Be Alright"
3,Could have been better,"The sound track was very nice and interesting but,the songs should have had better lyrics. Maybe if the tempos of certain songs were done or the lyrics a little more expressive."
5,One In A Million,"This is Aaliyah's 2nd CD and one of her best.There aren't too many tracks that you would want to skip over.The best songs are ""One In A Million"",""4 Page Letter"" and ""The One I Gave My Heart To"".Rest in Peace,Babygirl!"
5,Reasonably Priced,One in a Million ( including Bonus Track) is a reasonably priced CD from a multi talented performer who left us much too soon.
5,My favorite Aaliyah album,"This album is One In A Million. For reals. No one came out with this sound before Aaliyah. She has a style of her own and no one does it better than Ms. Haughton. This album comes with heavy hitters, ""One In A Million"", ""If Your Girl Only Knew"" and ""The One I Gave My Heart To"". It comes funky, smooth, and sexy all the time. There isn't one song on here that doesn't push the envelope or take you somewhere musically. They did good getting Aaliyah together with Timbaland and Missy Elliott. They are the perfect combination and it shows with this album. A must have!"
4,a wonderful follow-up album...,"The album was released in 1996-she was 17. Like her first album, she shows her age. Which is good, a lot of young artists try to go above and beyond their age. This album has more of a soft Hip Hop/R&B feel to it (as oppose to the other way around). Entertaining, much like her debut album ""Age Ain't Nothing But a Number"" but more mature with her age. If you liked her first, I think you'll like this one as well!!"
5,Best RnB Album Of The 90's,"Alot of cats say R. Kelly is the RnB artist of the 90's but really its Aaliyah. She is to RnB what Donna Summer was to Disco, a timeless beauty whose tracks always bring you back to the good times in your life."
4,A PRINCESS INDEED,"I AM SURE WE ALL MISS AALIYAH. IT WAS JUST A TOTAL LOSS FOR ALL OF US WHEN SHE PASSED. BUT SHE HAD THE CREATIVITY , HER OWN STYLE AND HER OWN SOUND. NO ONE CAN BE LIKE HER. THIS CD IS GREAT."
5,Delightful Christmas book!,"Children enjoy alphabet books, rhyming couplets and the story of Christ Jesus' birth, so this book combines three winning elements. In addition, the illustrations are especially appealing. I frequently give this book as a gift and highly recommend it. When my twenty-something daughter saw my copy of this book, she wanted one, too. You won't be disappointed."
4,Great Movie - Subpar DVD,"There's no denying that Strangers On a Train was one of Hitchcock's best movies, but this translation left a bit to be desired. The encoding on the DVD was obviously low-quality as there was a lot of artifacting and blurring, especially in scenes that contained a lot of motion. The DVD shipped in a blank case, leaving me to find album artwork myself - the end result looking like a cheap pirated DVD sold on the streets of Singapore. The sound quality was mediocre. I would love to see this great movie remastered and repackaged with more extras."
3,Not one of Hitchcock's Best,"Strangers on a Train was a good movie, but it certainly wasn't one of Hitchcock's best. Except for Robert Walker's haunting performance, most of the acting was garbage, which greatly contributed to the film's downfall. The premise, however, was very interesting. Good for one viewing, but no more than that. If you want Hitchcock's best, go for Psycho (my favorite), North by Northwest, Rebecca, Rear Window, and Shadow of a Doubt."
5,Fantastic!,This is deffinitely one on Hitchock's most chilling thrillers. The suspense keeps you ready to explode at any moment. The cinematography in the strangling scene is incredibly powerful. A must-see for any Hitchcock fan.
5,My favorite Hitchcock movie.,"STRANGERS ON A TRAIN is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie. I like it even more than VERTIGO, which is a movie that I love very much.There are so many wonderful things about this movie. But the thing that I like most is Robert Walker's performance. Actually, when I first saw this movie about two years ago, his character reminded me of Kevin Spacey's character in THE USUAL SUSPECTS. The way that he is shify and cunning, and the way that he uses various facial expressions to communicate his fear, paranoia, and just general crazyness.There are so many wonderful scenes in this movie. The opening scene where they show the shoes of the two main characters. The tennis match, where all pairs of eyes except one follow the moving tennis ball. The amazing climax at the merry-go-round. And so many others, too. All in all, this is a perfect movie."
4,Great edition of fine film,"Hitchcock was coming off a string of failures when he made this movie. His undertainty about commercial success (always a worry of his) caused him to make an uncharacteristic move: multiple edits and two different endings. If you've never seen the ""British"" version, this one is very revealing. Quality of the DVD is pretty good, but not perfect (still saw film flaws from time to time)."
4,A highlight among recent Hitchcock DVDs,"A razor-sharp image and ample extras make this DVD a terrific way to experience this top-tier Hitchcock title. A personal tip, though: if you never saw the film before, experience it first by watching the slightly shorter theatrical cut, rather than the alternate ""preview"" cut also included. The final theatrical cut is tighter and better paced, and contains a much more creative and satisfying ending, appropriately set on a train, that is entirely missing from the preview cut. It's funny, though... for a film that is often noted for its supposed homosexual subtext, such a theme isn't mentioned once in the ample documentary materials. I guess the current official line is that it's up to the viewer to decide what is and isn't there regarding Guy and Bruno's relationship. In any event, this is a first-class DVD treatment of a great film."
4,Great to have both endings !,"Since I've read reviews on this movie, I had always wanted to see both endings, the original American and the British. By putting both versions on one disc, Warners has shown the genius and the experimentation Hitchcock showed in this case. One minor complaint I have is that there is no letterboxed version. Oh well. The black and white is incredible, and, as he demonstrates in Psycho, very nerve-wracking. This film would be more mundane if it was in color."
4,Interesting look at 1940's America,"The movie is well done and fairly interesting, though predictable, but what I really enjoyed was looking at 1940's America, before WW2. If you like that sort of nostalgia, than this movie is for you!"
2,Interesting story but really bad acting,"If this movie had been directed by anyone else, it probably wouldn't even make it to DVD. The storyline is mildly entertaining but I found myself laughing in several places because the acting was so bad and some parts of the plot were completely unrealistic. A few interesting twists here and there, but overall I would recommend passing on this one unless you are a big Hitchcock fan."
2,Off rails,"Strangers on a Train (Alfred Hitchcock, 1951, 101')A psychotic socialite confronts a pro tennis star with a theory on how two complete strangers can get away with murder...a theory that he plans to implement. Another Hitchcock, after the Wrong Man (my review No 172us of 24/9/2012), same problems:Again a very high 8.2 Crime | Film-Noir | Mystery IMDb rating. Adaptation by Whitfield Cook from the novel by Patricia Highsmith, screen play by Raymond Chandler and Czenzi Ormonde, also: Ben Hecht (uncredited). Starring Farley Granger, Robert Walker and Ruth Roman.Sounds like name-dropping, but is real. Can hardly amass more quality credentials and produce a more boring film.185us Strangers on a Train (Alfred Hitchcock, 1951, 101') -Off rails - 29/9/2012"
1,I found no suspense here!,"This is a very superficial story. I can't even categorize it as a thriller.I relied on the reviews and the name recognition of Alfred Hitchcock, but I was tremendously disappointed.It is a mediocre movie in black and white.I do not have any desire to watch it again."
2,Been There! Done That!,"Listen to me! After viewing this flick, I didn't like the hero.I didn't like the hero's family. So how many stars do you expect me to give it? Give me a break. The only person I likedin the movie was Bruno. And that's only because Bruno and I are a lot alike in many ways. Tennis star. Yahty yahty yahty.Psycho-killer. Yahty yahty yahty. Clever but sterero-typedplot. Been there. Done that. Get real."
5,Look Closer,"Much has been written about this Hitchcock film.Take another look. There is no great Bernard Herrman score for this film. Farley Granger might be a bit miscast as the tennis player.Take another look ..this is PURE Cinema! The Black and White Images here need no film score by even a master like Herrman.This is one of the great masters films that really has to be seen again....but not often as a ""North by Northwest"" type of film.Robert Walker plays his role to the hilt..and there is nothing profound here ..just a sample of pure cinema. CP"
4,Strangers On A Train,"Very good movie. If you like good story lines with suspense and action, then I highly recommend Strangers On A Train. It is one of Hitcock's top 4 or 5."
4,strangers on a train,"I just want to add a small footnote to all the wonderful reviews about this DVD release. Side one is a RE-release of the film and is much grainier than the British PRE-release of 103 minutes. So when you buy this gem, go directly to the 103 minute version and ENJOY."
5,"More than a Classic, Hitchcock's Best","This may be one of Hitch's best films. Perfectly realized, inspired casting, a story with twists and turns, it is however most brilliant as a study of psychological abberation. It has some elements of the Noir style, but more is more subtle. The interaction of Granger and Walker... the bland tennis champ, the mentally unstable rich boy, is handled with finesse by Hitchcock. He plays their story out to near agonizing denouement. The suspense never lets up, never lets you down.Simple on it's surface, deep on reflection. It has not only stood the test of time, it just gets better with each viewing. Watch it for the superb acting, the deft directing, and try to find someone to watch with you, because you'll want to talk it over, to compare impressions, to ponder the alternatives."
5,Spooky!,"A very, very good movie. What makes it so good is the utter credibility of Guy's actions and responses to Bruno's unrelenting push to have him kill his father. The scene at the cocktail party gave me the creeps, and I feel the same each time I see it. That is probably the definition of an exceptional work, that you never tire of it, and that it always tugs at you one way or another."
4,Good Hitchcock movie,"The only reason I saw this was that I heard that this was his favorite of all the work he did. I had never even heard of the movie. Glad I decided to watch it. Was another good Hitchcock film to add to Vertigo, North by Northwest, Pyscho, Rear Window, and Dial M for Murder. There was some suspense. But I don't think it was as built up as the other greats because it lacked the star power, maybe. But it was more psychological I think. Anyway the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the ending was kinda weak. I do think some of the dialog was ahead of its time though. Some of this reminded me of Jerry Springer talk."
5,Completely Classic,"This film is amazing. The DVD brings Hitchcock back to life as it shows ""Strangers On A Train"" to a new audience. The film's plot is used as a basis for many plots on TV shows nowadays - CSI has even mentioned it.Wonderful. Pick it up."
3,Decent post Beatles effort for Paul and Co.,"I just went and bought this album because I wanted the long version of With A Little Luck (Only this album and Wings Greatest has the long version clocking at 5:42, everything else has the 3:10 edit)I liked a few of the songs here. Easily the best ones were London Town, Cafe On The Left Bank, Cuff Link, I've Had Enough, Famous Groupies, Girls School and of course the smash hit long version of With A Little Luck.Others weren't as good. Morse Moose and I'm Carrying were kind of dumb. The rest were mainly forgettable songs.Personally I like Back To The Egg better but this certainly has its high points.Please read all of my reviews!"
3,OK,"A new singer songwriter would be welcomed with such an album. Of Paul McCartney we expect more, and don't we have the right to? Of course not. Buy the Beatles albums, and try for yourself and find out what you like of their solo output. I think it is a very OK album, just not up to (late) Beatles standards."
2,Misplacing the muse,"Part of an underachieving four-album run (Speed of Sound, Back to the Egg, Mc Cartney II), London Town shows Mr. McCartney at loose ends. The song fragments don't work. I remember how frustrated I was the first time I heard Backwards Traveller- a short burst of infectious song followed by uninspiring synth junk.Earlier in McCartney's career, albums that received mixed reviews--Ram, Wild Life and Red Rose Speedway--all had enough gold in them to satisfy, nevertheless. By contrast, London Town--as well as Back to the Egg--very nearly miss completely.Fortunately, Tug of War was four years off. But then, another drought until Flowers in the Dirt, and so on..."
2,consider whether this is worth it...,"admit it - you're one of the few people who know this album. admit it - it really isn't worth the shelf space, except for one, maybe two, interesting tracks."
1,avilable,"I have a couple of friends who don't have a computer. Some CDs they like are not at the stores so I order them from you for them and they pay me back. I bought the Rachmaninoff for myself, one that is very hard to find. I received that, the two McCartney CDs & the Neil Young DVD, O.K.Thanks..."
4,I liked this album -- I'm not sure why,"The songs on this album have a nice, dreamy quality, e.g. London Town, With a Little Luck, Deliver Your Children. A good mix of acoustic and synthesizer stuff. Even the filler songs (all too common on a McCartney album) are pretty good, with the exception of Morse Moose and the Grey Goose. In my opinion this is McCartney's best, with the exception of Band on the Run (the only ""five star"" McCartney album). The bonus tracks -- Girl's School and Mull of Kintyre-- are great."
2,Long and Pointless,This is bad. The songs drone on forever and they have no point. This is the first REALL BAD McCartney album I've heard.
3,London Town- a good effort,"London Town hosts some great songs and some bad ones. London Town is one of the greatest songs of all time. Backwards Traveler is good except for the three minutes of Paul playing with a keyboard. Denny Laines contributions to the album are anything but ""me"" though I can understand people liking them a little bit. Morose Moose and The Grey Goose is a horrible song with a great name and is an AWFUL finale. If it wasnt for London Town,I'm Carrying, and Girlfriend this would be a two star album. (I like the Cover!)"
3,"pleasant, auto-pilot, has its moments","wings' london Town is probaby wings strangest album. I'm carrying, don't let it bring you down and deliver your children standout. Mccartney's voice on Girlfriend is lovely, but over-all the album shows the need for stricter editing that mared mccartney's 1980s work. The final track - I can can't bring myself to name it - is beyond awful, but the inclusion of the great Girls' School more than makes up for it. The album is uneven, but as with all wings' albums it is worth a listen."
3,Lacking Focus,"With ""London Town,"" Wings settled down after its triumphant USA tour to a series of meandering albums and a few hit singles before calling it quits. ""London Town"" sounds a little like the morning after. There are inspired moments, but much of it, including Denny Laine's songs, are lightweight, and by the end it has all gone on too long. George Martin and Geoff Emerick helped contribute here and there, and some of it was recorded on a boat at sea. The title song still sounds good, and ""With A Little Luck"" is a classic. ""I'm Carrying"" is also moving."
1,... Wishing,"I think people who give this a ""3"" star rating do NOT really realise what the ""3"" means. 2.5 in my estimation would be average ... and this disc is painfully below average for the master of the pop-hook. I never EVER liked any ""D.L."" songs and this disc just showcases his lack of talent. I do not know why Macca picked this dude up, his songs are ALL uninspired, but sadly Mac's songs on this disc aren't much better ... there are only 4 out of 15 that merit any praise. First up is the song that wasn't even originally included on the album ""Girls School"" is a fun romp, and sounds like a precurser to an INFINATELY better disc, Back to the Eggs' Spin it On. I've Had Enough, With a Little Luck, and Name And Address are good and that's it ... if you are looking for goods Wings try: Back to the Egg 5 stars, Venus and Mars 3 stars, and At the Speed of Sound 3 stars (this includes the bonus songs)"
3,Not Bad,This is a pretty good McCartneyalbum but there are very few rockersand it's mostly soft.. nothingspectacular.. but consistently good.
3,Denny Laine stands out,"Amazing how consistently the reviewers knock D.L.--. Funny, but those are the only two songs that stand out (for me, anyway) on the album. The rest seems like the usual McCartney fluff, with maybe catchy tunage, but throwaway lyrics. The Laine stuff is the only serious part of the album. You would think that people would have welcomed this, since it's what made the Beatles so great--Lennon the serious-minded lyricist, and McCartney the tunesmith. It was a good combination, and there was some possibility it could have worked similarly with Laine, if McCartney's head hadn't gotten too big for others to tolerate. But, it's the same reason the Beatle's broke up, so it should be no surprise Laine split."
3,A Mixed Bag,"There are four great McCartney songs on this CD and the rest is a mix between filler and outright trash. London Town, I've Had enough, With A Little Luck, and the bonus song Girls School are great. But McCartney reminds me a bit of Elvis on this CD: An extrordinary talent who more than half the time isn't even trying to get any where near his potential. Why waist so much talent on mediocre material? At least McCartney snapped out of it with his latest two CD's, Flaming Pie and Run Devil Run. Still and Yet, London Town is worth buying simply on the strength of the 4 songs mentioned above."
1,Paul forgets people are listening,"As much as I love the Beatles and Sir McCartney, this album is just plain awful. It's even worse than ""Red Rose Speedway"" and ""Wild Life."" For better Wings material, get ""Band on the Run,"" ""Wings Across America"" or ""Wings at the Speed of Sound."""
2,Very Forgettable,"This is not one of McCartney's better post Beatle albums. It has its moments with the title track, Cafe On the Left Bank, With a Little Luck, and the two solid Denny Laine tunes Children Children, and Deliver Your Children. Mostly, the album is made up with filler that probably should've never left the vault. Wings were probably just fulfilling their recording contract with this one."
3,Mixed Wings,"An improvement over ""Wings at the Speed of Sound,"" the uneven ""London Town"" (1978) could have used more rockers such as ""Name and Address"" instead of frivolous indulgences like ""Morse Moose and the Gray Goose."" Once again, Paul McCartney cannot differentiate between the gems (""Backwards Traveller/Cuff Link,"" ""I've Had Enough,"" ""Don't Let It Bring You Down"") and the dross (""Famous Groupies,"" ""Café on the Left Bank,"" ""With a Little Luck""). Fortunately, the gems win out - just barely. Having the classic single ""Girls' School"" as a bonus track doesn't hurt either."
3,What do you do with a Tangle?,"So we pulled it out of the box and my son grabbed it and manipulated it and twisted it and everything. It seemed like it was going to be a hit, but then he put it down...never to be played with again. To be fair, it is a pretty cool looking toy and I've enjoyed trying to get him interested in it. I'll give it that much, but it was me having all the fun with my son and I could have been doing that with or without the tangle."
2,tangle toy fun but broke easily,"this is a perfect distracton toy for an adult with dementia. they can manipulate it and it can come apart to facilitate dressing. It broke very easily, but I think once they can improve that aspect it will be a great dementia toy!"
2,Sort of useless,Hard to pull apart and very difficult for a child to put back together. Not much fun for a child. Not particularly interesting.
2,Inferior to their Jr product line,"The Tangle Creations Original Textured Tangle is a great idea with a poor implementation. The idea is a fidget toy, to keep the hands busy of people who think & relax better if they can fiddle with an object. This toy is intended for child or adult.My problem is that the tangle is fragile, breaks easily, and cannot be fixed. It broke within 15 minutes of when my daughter picked it up. Their Jr product line can snap back together if broken, if necessary dropping a link. This one is just plain broke, and from then on will just be a snake (no loop). My daughter kind of likes it anyway, but the poor construction is a problem for me.I recommend instead theTangle Creations Tangle Relax TherapyorTangle Creations Jr. Textured Sensory Fidget Toy."
1,Where's the therapy in this?,"I got this for my mother who has dementia diagnosis and fidgets; she hates it. I tried working with it, I didn't find it interesting at all. There is really nothing to it. I should have returned it but I thought my mother might change her mind. She didn't."
1,Don't buy this!,"This product came apart the first time it was used. I know it should come apart where one link fits into another, but this time the linking part came out of the link and could not be put back in. To appease the child, we had to remove two links and attempt to glue the white part that came out back into the link. Very disappointed!"
5,Great Gift,I bought this item for my boyfriends little brother who is autistic and he loved it! He has not put it down. Great item!
4,Excellent intoduction to congressional affairs,I enjoyed reading this book; it is a excellent resource. It gives a backstage pass for readers to see how Congress works and can be influenced. It gets specific right down to what Congressional staff members primary roles are and how best to leverage relationships with them.
1,Waste of money....,"This seems like it should be an Ep recorded at Abbey Road,but actually it is just random songs that are previouslyreleased with a cover and title that suggests it's somethingnew."
3,Good CD but...,"As with any EP, buyer beware. There is nothing on here that isn't on any other Chili Peppers CD. However if you are a true fan on socks this is a good cd for you..."
4,tells it how t was,My aunts lived as servant girls in England at the time this story takes place. I think the story is very true. How fortunate the girls of today have more options for employment. It is a good read.
2,Very boring.,"Tried to plod through it thinking surely a plot would develop since it came highly recommended. Alas, I gave up at 75% read. If you like to read about the mundane daily musings of a cook to different households, this is for you."
3,rather thin in content,Lacking in the more interesting elements of the day-to-day elements of what the life of a servant must have entailed. Perhaps I had hoped for more excitement and intrigue (ala Downton Abbey) which wasn't there. A very easy read in one sitting and mildly interesting. Grateful that it was an inexpensive book.
4,Below Stairs,"As an avid fan of Masterpiece Theatre, I found ""Below Stairs"" a poignant first person account of how terribly poor people in the UK survived and spent their productive lives catering to the aristocracy. Ms. Powell is easy and fun to read. She has a keen sense of humor and gives hilarious glimpses into the lives of the servants and their pursuit of a living when no one...no governmental social agencies cared a snap about how hungry the working class became...but this lady survived and so did her coping skills."
3,Insight to the staff,This is a good book for those wanting more insight on the staff of a large house. A good read showing the life of real life staff.
5,Easy and informative,This book is a factual and historic account of a life perhaps only found today at Buckingham Palace. An easy read that will hold your attention while on a plane or at the beach!
3,the life may be more interesting than the book,"The fault of the book is not so much in the actual life of the author but rather in the ""dry"" delivery of her experiences. It also would be helpful to have a glossary for some of the terms used such as ""charring"". Even though we seemingly speak the same language there are phrases or words peculair to those living in England that those in the U.S. would not be familiar with. I'm more than halfway through and it's doubtful I'll see it to it's end."
3,below stairs,"This was interesting, but fairly predictable. Not always a smooth read and not much anticipation. A pleasant story nonetheless and intriguing to know that it led to Downton Abbey which is well enjoyed."
3,just ok,"although this is a short book, it is also short on details. it was like reading someones boring diary and i kept waiting for some excitement or passion to happen.not everyone has an exciting life but i wanted to hear more of the history or feelings of a person living in this time frame....otherwise why write a book!?"
2,boring,"Not exactly riveting, this book was quite a disappointment. In fact, I didn't finish it. And it takes a lot for me to give up on a book...."
3,Below Stairs,"Interesting, easy read; sort of a prequel to Downtown Abby! Insight into what goes on in the ""servants ' quarters"" and how they are treated by their employers."
3,expected more,"a nice light little read, but i was expecting more. as a downton fan, i wanted more detail, but was an overall okay read on a snowy day."
1,Don't Bother,"This book was a major disappointment. The story droned on and on about the same things and wasn't interesting at all. I would definetely not recommend. If you have to have it, at least buy a used copy so you won't waste as much money as buying a new one."
4,Interesting and detailed,Tells you a lot about her life and what she went through and how a house was run during those times.
5,Below Stairs,"This was a wonderful book. A friend of mine had read it and recommended it to me so I bought it and read it also. She had such a terrible time but from all of the other books I have read and the videos that I have watched, it is how the servants lived. I really enjoyed this book and I would recommend it very highly."
3,In service to others,"Margaret's story of her time in service, first as a kitchen maid and then as a cook, brings to light the working conditions of the serving class in the early 1900s. Just as interesting is the attitude of ""them"" living upstairs in those great houses, the employers, their family members, and their friends. To think that just because a person was a servant that they couldn't read is so sad; to treat servants as less worthy of the basic comforts of life (food, shelter, kindness) is deplorable. As with many other reviewers, I have come down with Downton Abbey fever and am watching similar movies and reading books regarding about the servant class. Powell's book is a quick read; I enjoyed her wit but sometimes felt I was slogging through the details."
2,Worked well until it stopped working :(,"This lasted me about 4 months of daily use - when I first got it, it worked as well as one can expect from a thermometer, but it has recently stopped working. The spring/coil looks like it has come loose as the red dial no longer sits at 40 degrees, it swings all over the place. Will be replacing with another brand!"
1,thermometer,The thermometer did not work. but the company refunded my money.It would not read the temperature of the milk I was steaming.
4,Great for making the perfect latte,"After using this for a few days I now realise I was always making my lattes too cold. I thought for a while I was scalding the milk so when the pitcher became hot to touch I stopped. I now realise that I wasn't getting the milk hot enough.Lattes now taste better and are hot! Can't beat the price either, this was a great addition to my coffee tools!My only complaint might be the way it sits in the frothing pitcher as it sometimes gets in the way of the frothing wand. I've found this is not that inconvenient though and generally pretty easy to work around."
3,Cheap feeling,"I previously had a Taylor but gave it to a friend. This was priced right so I bought it. I found it very inferior to the Taylor. The dial and needle were wobbly and felt very cheap. Effective in use, but very annoying to hold. On a 12oz pitcher, the dial seems to large."
2,Poor Quality Parts,I found this product works well but is not robust. This is my second one and both have developed cracks in them during winter months and after about a year of use. I keep the parts insulated. The third valve I have is from a different manufacturer and is holding up well.
1,Noisy and failed,Bought this Rain Bird sprinkler valve a little over a year ago and it started out with minor water hammer problems. Every time it turned on/off it would rattle the plumbing--easy to tell when the sprinkler went on/off. After several months of use the valve started having worse water hammer problems getting progressively louder. After being off all winter this valve worked as its usual noisy self and then one morning started cycling on and off with severe water hammer that was impossible to turn off. It was so bad that my neighbor showed up wondering what was rattling his plumbing. Turning the timer off still didn't solve the problem-it still cycled on/off. The only solution that worked was to turn the water off to the sprinkler system and replace the valve. Replaced the Rain bird valve with a new Lawn Genie valve and was impressed with how quiet it turned on and off--zero water hammer. Replaced the other Rain Bird valves with new Lawn Genie valves and whole system now much quieter.
3,"Valve good, shipping not","These Rain Bird 3/4 inch jar top anti siphon valves for sprinkler systems seem to work fine (I ordered 3 and have installed one thus far). I'm submitting this review only to note that during shipping somebody managed, incredibly, to CHOP OFF THE SOLENOID CONNECTION LEADS of one of the three valves I ordered. It's too much trouble to return; I can solder on new leads, but it reflects astonishingly bad handling."
3,Water sprinkler,"This valve doesn't fit the system I install , had to make modifications and it still doesn't work right."
5,Great for glass bi-fold locker doors,"After a couple of months, I couldn't be more happy with this product. It works great on my glass bi-fold locker doors.Being on the outside helps the door flatten out. Made a big difference to the appearance."
5,Solid purchase,"Unfortunately this is the second time I had to buy one of these. The product is solid and I've been very happy with it. I bought the deadbolt lock so that it wouldn't be stolen but it disappeared anyway. I think I may have lost it in a car wash. So, I ordered another one. It came but was missing the hardware. I was able to ship it back and get another one without any problems. It's a very solid steel (heavy) item and definitely worth the purchase!"
3,Me dan otra bebida,"El Muerto (The Mexican Crow) is based on the comic about a guy named Eric who gets killed, paints his face up and goes after bad people... oops wrong film, that was The Crow. Please let me start over. El Muerto (The Mexican Crow) is based on the comic about the foreign guy from That 70's Show who gets killed, paints his face up and goes after bad guys. Keep in mind that these two films (and I assume comics) are completely different from each other, after all The Crow was shot by bad guys before he gets his revenge and The Mexican Crow drives into a tree while concentrating on some mariachi radio station. To be perfectly honest I was impressed with this film, although it is a complete rip off from J. O'Barr. It was definitely smarter than the last 2 Crow movies and I hate to admit that Fez is adorable even without the accent. Check it out, you might surprise yourself."
2,THE WORST SOUND EDITING EVER!!!,"I just watched this movie and couldn't wait for it to be over so I could do something actually entertaining. The entire movie I had to constantly turn it up and down due to the horrible sound editing. This should never have been released as it is. It goes from speaker-bursting volumes to dialogue so faint you have to turn your TV all the way up. It is worse than any movie I have ever seen/heard. I'm sure my neighbors and the whole town's dogs hate me now. There are only a few times that you actually have just over a minute or two of actual dialogue without horribly loud music and sound effects. For 1.5 hours, I literally turned the TV up and down almost every minute to be able to hear the scattered dialogue, but mostly it was just blaring noise during this entire fiasco."
4,A Must for Steve Martin Fans,"Two of Steve Martin's best(the only thing better would be a Triple, that included The Jerk) - no special features(or even widescreen, but an excellent way to start, or complete, a collection)...'Nuff Said'."
2,Misleading Title,"This movie just isn't all that funny. I was really dissapointed, being a big Steve Martin fan. But this came across as a bad version of ""All of Me."" (A Hilarious Movie) There are a few good gags in the movie, but everything else just seems so contrived and not all that funny. It's a good concept, and a bad movie. Rent it if you must, but it's not that great.And the cover of the movie makes you think Steve Martin has two brains. He doesn't. Not worth it."
2,WHAT THE,"I KNOW IT THIS MOVIE WAS ALL THE HOT SEX.AND STEVE MARTIN HA,HA THIS IS THE FIRT STEVE MARTIN MOIVE I DID NOT LIKE."
3,"Nice movie, bare bones DVD","This is a nice Steve Martin movie, with some good laughs. It's enjoyable and funny. Not the funniest thing ever, but certainly not bad. I'd give it 4 stars.The DVD is the simplest I've seen. The sound is in mono (! ), there are no special features, no subtitles, nothing. There is a scene selection menu, which is entirely textual. There's supposed to be close captioning, but I have no idea how to get at that. I wish they had normal subtitles.In short, there's a reason that this DVD is inexpensive, but this doesn't detract much from the enjoyable movie (except that I would have liked subtitles, as English is not my native language, and having things spelled out helps)."
1,full-screen version,"URGH! This is the full-screen version, i.e. it's cropped! Maybe I missed this but I don't see it anywhere in the description! These movies are both awesome but now I have to buy them again."
4,What happened to great movies like this?,"You don't see movies like these any more. Steve Martin is one of my favorites, and this is probably his best movie after the Jerk. If you want a good laugh, watch this movie."
1,The Jerk Finally Got Widescreen So Why Not The Man With Two Brains?,"The Man With Two Brains is a hilariously funny movie! Steve Martin is very funny and Carl Reinger is a great director! But I'm very disappointed with this DVD. It's just an edited pan and scan version and the same thing was done with the first DVD release of Carl Reiner's and Steve Martin's other hilarious movie The Jerk, but this year a new widescreen DVD was released for The Jerk and I was hoping that a new widescreen DVD would also be released for The Man With Two Brains but unfortunately it hasn't happened! I really would love a widescreen DVD! As it is this is a 5 star movie on a 1 star DVD!"
4,Excellent Product - once you get it installed!,"Although it seemed to install OK, I couldn't get it to record for my life. I uninstalled and reinstalled twice. After lots of fooling around with the configuration I finally was able to record!This thing is absolutely great. One of the first things you come to appreciate is the free online TV guide. With the guide I can find my show easily and then tell it to record all new episodes. It then skips old episodes and will even follow the show when it moves from one night to another (i.e. goes from Wednesday night @ 7pm to Thursday @ 8pm). Try that with your VCR!Recordings can take up a ton of disk space - about 2.4 gig per hour. Beyond TV has an option where it will shrink the disk space required after the show completes. You can tell it to do the shrinking during non prime-time so it doesn't interfere with your usual work. Net effect is about 1/4 of the space is needed (.7 gig versus 2.4 gig) and I can't detect any quality difference!"
1,beyondtv cant install,"I tried to install this for 2 weeks and can't intall it. The installation wizzard complains that it can't find an internet connection. The tech support could not identify the problem and told me to wait (forever?) until they fine a fix. Apprently, BeyondTV has problems communicating with some ISP's. This is a known problem that Snapstrem didn't disclose. Now I'm stuck with software that will not even install (dell 2.5ghz with 1g memory). My $62 purchase is worthless. The warrenty specifically states that installation problems are not covered. Totally dissatisfied."
4,Beyond TV,"This is a solid program. Record tv shows.I won't repeat what others have said about what all it can do so I will jump to why I gave it 4 stars.Beyond TV does not record in anyother format other then MPEG-2.You can choose the quality of the file but you can not change MPEG video or audio formats. This makes the process of using popular DVD making programs like Vegas DVD architect, Nero, and Roxio Re-encode/transcode when making DVDs (witch takes a long time with slow processors). In most cases you will find the video format (720x480 NTSC 29.975 fps) ok. The audio format will cause programs to re-encode/transcode.So if you want to just record and watch shows this is a very good program. If you want to record and make DVDs then your better off finding something else."
3,Dance Hall Days,"By the time of this May 30, 1989, release, Public Image Ltd. had become an ongoing solo project for John Lydon and long gone was an exploration of a cutting-edge vision for the soundscapes.Slated to be a collaboration between Lydon and producer/bassist Bill Laswell - which fell apart due to artistic differences - the 10 tracks fit easily into clubland rhythms, with Disappointed the superior track; it reached #1 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart.The mostly-instrumental U.S.L.S. 1, Happy? and Brave New World allow the musicians - Alan Dias (b), John McGeoch (g), Bruce Smith (d) - to keep the grooves moving.Even as the band settled into the ""alternative"" dance sound, it continued to expand the fan base - being part of ""The Monsters of Alternative Rock"" tour - with PiL demonstrating staying power as the post-punk movement began to swerve into a revival of the darkwave style."
3,DAMN BACKUPSINGERS,this album would be amazing if it werent for those goddamn backup singers.. they make it sound like its a disney soundtrack.
5,cars 2,"Not ony better than first but FAR FAR BETTER. So good you have to watch it more than once. Very creative with great characters. Longer than the norm which since it is so good makes it all the better.If you don't like this, you really are a very OLD person."
1,Keep the politics out!,"When I take my kids to movies, I want to be entertained, PERIOD! I do not go to Pixar movies to be informed or enlightened. I want a plain vanilla movie that is fun. What I don't want is what Cars 2 attempts to dish out: Another movie trying to exploit ""Big Oil"". It really makes me want to puke! Just what is Lightning McQueen? A race car, not a golf cart. And the villain in this movie? A character who will profit from ""Big Oil"". The very first scene is hundreds of oil platforms with smoking flares. Give me a break! What is ironic is that Pisxar's DVD is made from polycarbonate. Most polycarbonates of commercial interest are derived from rigid monomers, which come from.... wait for it... crude oil. OMG! I am quitting my job and marching on Wall Street!"
1,Not a Good Choice,"This franchise did not deserve to have a sequel. There where so many other options, but no!Pixar was just trying to make a quick buck on this movie.When Cars 1 ended it all ended, nothing more to extend upon.When the Incredibles ended, it ended on a cliffhanger.And i believe that Monsters Inc. deserved a sequel.So...I believe that this movie is a waste of time and was made just to take the money of poor parents that have their children screaming, wanting every car from the terrible movie."
1,Sorry ... FAIL,"Plain and simple...THIS IS A MOVIE THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD A SEQUEL !!Plot is all over the place .. Not one of My 3yr,7yr, or 9yr old children sat through this boring mess of Disney disaster..Lack luster Disney movie that should not have been !! ughWhat they should have done is made an Incredible's 2 ... What were they thinking with this smh :("
2,Where are all the great bonus features?,"Cars 2 was an Ok movie, but I'm really disappointed in the bonus features. I use to love watching the hours of great looks behind the scenes Pixar use to include on their DVD and Blu-rays. With each release they become skimpier and skimpier. One Mater Tale, which is only a commercial for the new Pixar show ""Planes"", the Toy Story short, and a director commentary, that's it! I feel short changed. We use to get tours of Pixar, got to sit in on story conferences, deleted scenes, concept art ect. I guess they are saving that for the double dip. Pixar use to be all about bang for the buck, since Disney took over they seem to only be about the buck."
2,Wrong Message,"We saw this movie at the theatre and my 4 year old got bored mid way through. When all was said and done, we felt it had a real adult theme and when I asked him to tell Grandma about Cars 2, he said, ""the bad guys were trying to ""kill"" Lighting McQueen"", that definitely isn't the message we want to bringing home on a DVD. Skip it unless your kids are older and even then I think the older kids will get bored with the theme."
1,VERY VIOLENT!!!! NOT A KIDS MOVIE!!!!,"Very disapointing!! Not at all like first Cars movie. Lots of weapons and shooting, spies ang killing. Once again Disney has made a movie aimed at young children with adult themes and humor that is not appropriate for the developing young, hearts and minds of the next generation! Preview before deciding to allow your children to see this!"
1,Disappointed,Way to violent and political. My family and i loved the first movie. We had high expectations and were very disappointed.
5,Perfect Gift!,I ordered this movie at the request of a small boy who would not have got the gift he wanted otherwise. He loved it!
2,"My kids like it, but saying ""kill"" so many times is not needed!","Firstly, the word ""kill"" is used a LOT in this movie! And trust me, it gets repeated! I realize that it's a spy movie, but they could say ""get rid of him!"" or ""take care of him!"" instead of ""kill him!""and on top of that, it get's repeated at school! ""Im going to kill you emily!"" really, pixar, really??My children finally quit saying it (they are 3 to 5) and now that isn't as much an issue...other than that I don't think the story is nearly as cute or amusing as it was in the first movie. This one seems far ""darker"" and even more on the level of older children. Mine didn't really know what was going on most of the time they were just like WOO Lightening McQueen! (when he did occasionally show up)as far as my kids are concerned, they like the movie. As a parent, It isn't my favorite and it gets pushed to the back of the movie shelf."
3,Alright,"I got this strictly for my son. He absolutely loves it. He's also a toddler. But as far as expectation with regard to the first one, it kind of fell short. It's not a Lightning McQueen movie. It's a Mater movie. It has most of the same actors from the forst Cars film, so that little bit was appreciated. However, the story was just not what was expected."
3,Not nearly as good as the first one,"Animation is great, the characters are good, the story...not so much. This sequel just feels contrived in a way that the studio just had to keep the franchise going and came up with a lame big oil story line. But the kid sure likes seeing Mater."
1,"Horrible, not appropriate in any sense...","Short and sweet: too violent, characters kept saying kill you, or I thought you were dead..., themes too adult where most kids don't even know what's going on. don't know how this could ever be rated G. Shame on PIXAR..."
1,Disappointing Cars 2,The Cars 2 DVD was sealed from the factory (or so it appeared) but when I tried to play it for my son's third birthday it would not play past the third chapter/scene. I inspected the disc and found no scratches or imperfections in the disc. I don't blame the company that sold it or Amazon I think it was just a flaw from the DVD factory in China.
5,CARS 2 - GREAT!!,"BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GRANDSON. OF COURSE,I GOT TO SEE IT TOO. QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE FIRST, BUT WAS A PERFECT SPY MOVIE FOR KIDS (ADULTS WERE REMINDED OF THE SPY MOVIES OF THE 1960'S). GOOD FAMILY FUN!"
1,Inappropriate for Children under 13,"The quantity of violence is overwhelming in this Disney-Pixar offering. The negative comments you will read on Amazon are TRUE. I just previewed this ""movie"" before giving it to my five year old son for Christmas because of the large divide in Good vs Bad reviews and the comments about violence, torture and death. They all have merit. This is a SICK and TWISTED tale that is not for toddlers or young children. It should have been rated PG-13 to warn parents. THANK GOODNESS FOR AMAZON.COM and it's REVIEWS! Thanks to the honest reviewers and good parents who warned about the dark inappropriate nature of this pitiful attempt to derail children. The script and storyline are also twisted. But that is really not the issue. As a father I cannot recommend this to anyone with children under 13."
2,Weak,I enjoyed the first one much more. Not as clever and less innocent. I thought they relied on sexual jokes too much... anyone can do that. Disappointing.
1,Beyond Disappointed.,"Our son LOVES the original movie Cars. We have watched it multiple times and were thrilled to see that second movie would be coming out. Within 5 minutes of the movie starting, my jaw dropped and I asked my husband if we should leave. Luckily our 3 year old didn't ask any questions about the excessive violence. I was completely appalled. We weren't warned, and I NEVER would have taken him to see this.I was, and continue to be extremely disappointed in the plot and execution of this movie. Major thumbs down Pixar."
2,"Son 2 and Daughter 5 - disappointed, not as good as Cars","This was my children's first trip to the movies. Neither one of them liked it. Too much action, too much death, the storylines were too complex, not enough of the core characters, and it did not have the heart of Cars. BIG LETDOWN! If I let my son he would watch cars everyday. My daughter and son play cars all the time. My daughter told me that she did not really want to see cars 2 again. Maybe the movie is for 8-10 year olds?"
3,It's not CARS 1,"This movie has almost no relation to the first Cars movie except a few cars and Mater. The mood is entirely different and any child 6 or under will be scared out of their wits. It features race after race, shoot 'em ups and explosions over and over and over.The tribute to Paul Newman's car was a nice touch.The moral of the story was good, but it took way too long to get to it. I thought the movie would never end. It reminded me of adult action movies, which some will love, but not young kids for sure. Parents were taking their kids out of the theatre within 1/2 hour. Our theatre has a particularly loud sound system, which added to the trauma I'm sure."
2,How could this possibly be rated G???,"My family and 4 year old enjoyed the first CARS movie so it was natural that we would want to see CARS2. What a dissapointment. There was way too much violence for young children. I take my child to less than 5 movies per year and only G rated. I'm sorry I wasted our time and money on this one. I had to continually explain the storyline to my child (bad guys vs good guys) due to the shooting/violence. This movie should be rated PG. As far as adult enjoyment, weak storyline. there is so much they could have done to develop characters based on the good foundation from the original CARS movie. This one is an utter failure."
2,Why the violence?,"I just can't understand why Disney/Pixar would produce a movie that is designed for 2-5 year old boys that is overrun with violence. Explosions, shooting... they even torture and kill (kill off-screen) Rod Torque Redline. Cars 1 was filled with heart. It was about friendship and small-town living. This is a James Bond movie with cartoon cars in place of actors. My 3 year old son was so excited to see this movie. Mater's Tall Tales is better than this movie."
1,Cars 2 Made Me BOYCOTT Cars Toys,"This film was written to market new cars for the Pixar Cars line. If you could get past the spy and espionage theme of the film, could you get past the CLEAR merchandising strategy of manipulating the viewer into buying new versions of mater, and all the new Euro cars? I'm definitely not buying it. Pun intended.And it's not just about espionage and ""secret agents"" like you would find on an episode of the Backyardigans trying to solve a mystery, they actually have themes of torture in the film (i.e. stripping a car's tires to extract information from him). I was completely shocked. It was the first time ever taking my 2 year old daughter to the movies, and I wish she had never seen it. Cars is a sweet, character-driven film, Cars 2 has rare sweet moments and it's more of a plot-driven action film.I can see why many people might like this film, but I hope people can see why many people would find Cars 2 to be quite extreme for them."
1,Completely inapproprite -,"I would love to understand and hear the reasoning behind the frivalous story line.. did they miss the mark completely on purpose. Let alone the fact that they just HAD to put some kind of gun fire in this useless movie..but to adopt a mission impoossible theme or James Bond theme - with english accent actors.. I love Kane but not in a cartoon..CARTOOOOOON people...this is for children not me, not teens, not walt disny adult babies, but kids, 1 2 3 years old.. how the **** are they suppose to remotely follow this story line. This movie sucked fropm beginning to end..The first one was so sweet and simple..to the point..here the've gone overboard on every element..even the music.. If you did not buy this movie..keep on doing it.. just keep watching cars 1..believe me..it's a waste of time and money.."
1,unhappy custmer,the 3D DVD < CARS 2 > skips and freezes the first time I played it and my kids were very unhappy too. my DVD player is new and works great on other 3D DVD movies including the LIONG KING DVD that I bought with CARS 2.they should replace this defective product and send me a new one
2,Not as good as the original,"My granddaughter loved the original movie, but this version was a bit too complicated for her to follow. Don't bother to spend the money. Rent it first and see if it holds their interest."
1,off the mark,"the original Cars film was amazing and my son loved it. We thought Cars 2 would be the perfect first theater experience for him and were sorely disappointed. Pixar has never been more off the mark. The first film was funny for kids and adults, with jokes appropriate for all age levels. Cars 2 was violent and offensive. My son asked to leave after 20 minutes and I wish we had. We stayed, thinking it was just the theater experience he had to adjust to, then they had cars beating up another car in the bathroom! The whole film was uncomfortable to watch with a 4 year old.I was happy that they made reference to losing Paul Newman and there were obviously a few funny things, but overall, this movie is not appropriate for the same age group as the first movie. Definitely screen this movie before family movie night or you could have some upset children."
1,Its not the item appears to be.,"Online for DVD sucks. Buy at your local video store, target or costco. Ive been getting some interesting conversation about amazon."
2,"very good movie, but bad description to order : NO FRENCH LANGUAGE or FRENCH SUBTITLES","Dear Amazon. com, (sorry for my bad english)You must change your order description : I know on the box is written FRENCH LANGUAGE or FRENCH SUBTITLES, but when you open it you have just spanish and spanish/mexican languages or subtitles ! Only the bonus blu-ray have french subtitles. It's the first time Disney make that on the boxes, and of course you give the same bad information on the order description.Of course the film is wonderful and Pixar is the first animation Studio in the world with Disney.I thanks Amazon.com to try to send me one another box, but it is the same problem for french people.Cordially yoursM.Dupuy"
3,Not as good as first one,Was disappointed. I liked it but wasn't as great as the first one. Wouldn't have bought it if I knew that
3,Where is the 5.1?,"As a movie, you watch Cars 2 because you have young kids and they love it. I read a review that put it best: ""Perhaps Pixar simply got tired of turning out one masterpiece after another and decided to glide"".In terms of video quality, the HD is very good. The fact that this is all CGI lends itself better to streaming.My main complaint, and this isn't limited to this movie, is that streaming HD is NOT 5.1 with six channels of audio. This was full PCM that I let my analog Dolby Surround unit distribute. For a movie like this, that's more annoying if only because the web page states that the movie has 5.1 (no such claim is made, wisely, on the connected device when you go to rent). I wish Amazon would stop making the 5.1 claim on its other content since I have yet to find any that has a digital audio stream."
3,Mater vs the World,"By now, most of you have read the spoiler reviews. It wasn't the movie I had anticipated plot/story wise, but an interesting character development for Mater. I was delighted to hear Michael Caine as Finn Mc Missle. Perfect. It is a good addition to my Disney/Pixar collection that both my grandchildren and I enjoy."
2,Too old content for younger children.,"I was excited to get this movie for my son (4) who loves the 1st Cars movie and we got it for him for his birthday. It was a cute concept with the ""spy"" stuff but the movie in my opinion was WAY too violent for a 4 yr old. They shoot each other with guns and try to ""KILL"" each other. They say the word ""kill"" many times. Just not something I want my 4 year old to say or pretend to do. I will be putting the movie away until he gets older and undersatnds the concept that it is just a movie and isnt appropriate to do those things in real life.Oh and the DVD doesnt work in certain dvd players. It wouldnt work in my one dvd player but would in my other one. They were both brand new players.The one it wouldnt work in was a LG dvd player."
2,Really???????,First off let me say that I didn't think that Cars needed a sequel. It was by far not my favorite Pixar film but it had its charms and everything wrapped up well in the end and Mcqueen learned a lesson about friendship...or did he? Well apparently he didn't but that fact doesn't even take center stage in this film. Instead we get a James Bond spoof with Mater taking center stage with two spy cars and all of the charming characters from Radiator Springs get put in almost as an afterthought.Of course the visuals are stunning but it wasn't enough to keep my boys interested and my oldest even asked to watch something else about three times starting only 10 minutes into the movie. One of my younger ones disappeared and returned with the original movie asking to watch it instead.Not a terrible film but Pixar can certainly do better.
2,Major disappointment,"Cars 2 was a major disappointment. I don't know if the writers for the movie changed from the first one to this one, but the first Cars movie was delightful and well written and targeted for children. The Cars 2 movie had a story line way too advanced for smaller children and couldn't even hold the interest of our older grandkids. Our younger grandkids had no real interest after we watched half the movie and the older grandkids were bored to no end and so were we, and we were huge fans of the first Cars movie. If we decide to ""preserve"" a copy of this Cars 2 movie, we'll just wait until it comes on Pay for View and record it, we sure won't be wasting money to buy it."
1,Not for children,"I did not like it. It was VERY violent. Okay for me since I have seen it all but the look on my baby's face when they KILLED a car (while chanting, ""Kill him!""). ""Mama, what did they just do to that car?"" Guns and shooting throughout the whole film. Cars 2 left me feeling disturbed and unsettled, ""Did I just show my children a murder?"". I really wish I had previewed this cartoon prior to watching it with my children. With Disney/Pixar I have not previously had to preview films; they were suitable for young children, Cars 2 is not. This film is a secret agent thriller with adult themes. I"
2,Very disappointed,"I've always been a Pixar fan, but this was the first big miss that I've seen from them. I thought Toy Story 3 was bad, but this was worse. I should have waited for this movie on DVD from netflix. $5 was too much to pay for this movie."
1,Mator with a bomb strapped on him? Winnie the Pooh next?,"Awful movie and not geared for small children as the first was, but I don't know what age group they would be going for with cars that have eyeballs? (Tongue fully planted in cheek.) This was designed to attempt to indoctrinate the young and thick in political agenda. NOTHING like the original and that wonderful soundtrack. This is a violent propaganda film, done in cartoon, that degrades blue collar workers, as well as American oil companies (No, not middle eastern oil, just ours.) Like a bait and switch going on here, where they build your trust in a wonderful movie with beloved characters, then sneak this total MEAN garbage in the next round. Contains violent kill scenes, torture, death, and bombs strapped on Mator! Winnie the Pooh and Mickey Mouse next for this brand of hate? Be sure to borrow or rent this before buying it."
2,Disappointing,"If you've watched Cars, then the sequel will be a huge let down. The story is slow moving and just irritating to follow. My 5 yr old son will only watch it with the sound turned down. Enough said. Save your money, buy the cars 2 leapster explorer game instead. My son gets far more enjoyment out of that and he's learning to boot."
5,We really enjoyed it.,"As a parent of young kids, I was a bit worried based on the reviews of Cars 2. I thought it was extremely well done and I enjoyed the 007/James Bond aspect of it. They to manage the delicate balance of entertaining kids along with parents and I thought it was done quite well. The details involved in the movie were amazing; I think you have to catch it a couple times to fully appreciate them. It has been a top request at my house for movie night and I think we will get a ton of use out of this one."
2,Will NOT be getting a purchase from me,"I really can't understand how John Lasseter thought this was a worthy follow-up to a wonderful movie like the first Cars. I think that movie gets a lot of undeserved flack, but this one deserves every bit of it.The premise alone worried me quite a bit. A movie about simple life values given a sequel as a spy movie? It doesn't work as a James Bond parody. It doesn't work as a comedy. It just flat out doesn't work. Once in the theater was too much. No way will I be buying it on BR or DVD.Only thing that saves it from getting one star was the final chase sequence, which was fairly entertaining, but definitely not worth the first parts."
5,Great Gift,"I purchased this DVD as a Christmas present for my car loving son. Since this first movie was a great movie, I expect the follow up to be just as good."
5,Just plain fun,"This has quickly become my kids new fav. My favorite part is the Pixar short ""Toy Story Hawaiian Vacation"" and I am so glad that it is on both the DVD and Blu-Ray discs. Haven't tried the 3-D disc as we don't have the player, but figured that someday we might.For those that haven't see it yet, it is a darker story then the original and for my 4 year old twins a bit too complicated storyline to follow. Of course this doesn't stop the desire to see it......I just have to explain many aspects of the movie to them. :-) My 7 year old LOVES it!!"
1,This Cars belongs in the junkyard!,"Pixar has once again created a marvelous looking film. Unfortunately, the animation and special effects is about all this movie has going for it. Aside from the fact that story drags and is nowhere near as interesting as Cars 1, Pixar/Disney thought it would be appropriate to make political propaganda a centerpiece of this film. It even goes as far as taking numerous jabs at ""Big Oil"" as referred to in the film - kind of ironic for a sequel spawned by an original movie starring a gas-powered racecar. I thought Pixar had a principal never to include politics in their films? They clearly violated that with this film. Not to mention that Mater - the annoying broken down tow-truck - is clearly the star of this movie, instead of Lightning McQueen - adding to the monotony.So, a combination of a boring plot plus heavy-handed political drivel makes Cars 2 a loser. Stick with the original, which has a far superior story and is far less preachy!"
1,"""Mater's Tall Tales"" was better than this!","""Cars 2"" had too many new characters to keep track of, couldn't decide if it was a race movie or a spy movie, was too dark and serious for kids, and will never stand the test of time like the first classic ""Cars"" movie! ""Mater's Tall Tales"" (though a series of straight-to-video shorts) is a much better sequel."
4,Yoki,"Product arrived in timely manner and as advertised. No issues. When I ended up needing a return, it took two emails to get that process started. However, the return was successful after the slow start. In the end, I was satisfied."
5,Car 2 DVD,My DVD received so quickly I couldn't believe it. It was exactly what I ordered and at a very good price.Thank you. I will order from you again.
1,Not for children,We watched Cars with our four years old son and he enjoyed it. We were looking forward to more family friendly entertainment with Cars 2 (Rated G). What a huge let down. The spy plot is so complicated that our son kept asking what was going on. He was confused and lost interest quickly. McQueen is rarely present in the movie. Cars spend most of the movie shooting at it each other. Really? I thought cars were supposed to *race* one another. Very disappointed at Disney for allowing this kind of violence to permeate every aspect of our lives. Shame on them.
5,movie,"Grandchildren loved it. No more else to say. blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah"
1,Scratched DVD,My son wanted this movie as an easter present for the easter bunny...so I bought it and it is very scratched and skipps through the whole movie. SO he is very dissapointed in the Easter bunny. I felt so bad....I will never buy from this person again. Very dissapointing.
5,big save,"When to a Christmas dinner the kids go a Car DVD but not the movie. I told the kids Grandma, that's me, we can watch the movie of the demand channel the next day. When my cable needed working on it frozen the channel to watch the movie. I order the movie that night from you. I toke less then a week to get it. My cable still is not fixed and the movie if it was is not playing. Thank-you for saving Grandma. Oh, the DVD is sold out around here. Thank-you."
4,Love it!,"My son bought it for a Christmas present for his dad. My husband has watched it three times since Christmas. Per my husband, ""Love the animation! Pixar delivers, as they did in the first one. Also, love the bonus features."""
4,Cars 2,"This is the only DVD my grandson asked Santa for this Christmas. He saw it in the movie theater and loved it. I thought it was cute, but loved the original Cars better."
1,Unnecessarily Violent; Tired Hollywood Agenda,We were anxiously awaiting this movie and took our 3 young children to the theater when it opened. As big fans of the first Cars movie; we couldn't have been more disappointed in the sequel. This movie is unnecessarily violent and pushes the tired Hollywood theme of the evil oil company. I really wanted to walk out of the theater. Don't waste your time with this trash.
1,nothing at all like the first,"Cars 2 is a terrible movie.The story is very dull,and as mentioned in another review,it is way too violent for children.I would highly recommend passing this up and just picking up the first film.Hopefully Cars 3 will be a whole better than this."
1,"Torture, murder, guns, death rays, bombs = G rating?","This movie should come with a warning label especially as the original ""Cars"" was actually a G movie. This has an enhanced interrogation to death scene. Lots of guns shooting, death rays, a bomb and killing (is the fate of the cars hit with the same death ray used to murder the spy ambiguous?). Loads of violence, but little charm or character development. If the characters were the same and Disney didn't keep the Pixar label, then you'd never suspect it had any relation to the original cars movie. After ""Cars"" I let my 4 yr. old see ""Cars 2"" without first screening it - huge mistake."
3,"Pointless, yet Entertaining","I suppose I could see why this film is Pixar's least critically successful feature, but for what is is it is pretty entertaining. I find it a little more entertaining than the original Cars, but the idea for Cars 2 to be a spy movie..well, let me put it this way; I think a spy themed film would be better off as a separate Pixar film. The idea for this movie is somewhat pointless, but its not a terrible movie (and to tell you all the truth I enjoy it more than Pixar's Up). But I think this represents that the Cars francise is more for little kids. I recently watched Doug Walker's Disneycember review on this film and we both agree that The Incredibles was the Pixar film other than Toy Story to deserve a sequel. Watch this and you'll understand his point."
2,For older kids,"the first cars move was great for my 2-3 yr old. He loved it so much that we bought part 2. It talks a lot about killing and blowing up each other and even torturing a car for info. FAR stretch from part 1 easy going, not too much bad guy for younger kids."
3,Cars2 dvd,It was shipped to late for Christmas but I gave it to the little boy after anyway.He was happy to get it.
2,disappointed,The disc arrived and I noticed a spot on the edge of the disc. I put it in the dvd player and it played the first thirty minutes of the movie then froze up. I decided to just go ahead and purchase this movie from walmart!
3,Cars 2,Movie was not as good as the first cars. I did enjoy some of the extras on the disc especially the toy story short
5,Great Movie,"My son loves this movie. He always watched the first movie over and over and over again. It never got old to him. However, me I had it remembered by heart. Lol. Great movie thought. Worth buying."
3,dvd,I bought this dvd for my husband and kids for christmas. It was a great movie of what we could see it keep freezing up thur out the movie so we had to keep skipping ahead so we miss alot of the movie.I tried it in all the dvd player we still keep doing it.
4,Grandson's favorite,"My grandsons love both Cars movies. I prefer the first one to this one because I like the theme of caring about others more than winning and the fact there is little violence. However, both are fun to watch."
2,not as good as cars,not as good as cars. But my son sometime still watches it. He watches Cars way more than he does with Cars 2 though.
1,PAINFULLY BAD...,"I was so looking forward to this movie since the first Cars movie was so cute...but this movie is just BAD. No catchy songs, no funny jokes, tooooo much talking. How did they think kids would have the attention span to follow this??? I lost interest in the first 5 minutes but stuck it out hoping for it to get interesting at some point - no such luck."
2,disappointed,loved the original. cars 2 lacks heart. lets hope if there is a 3rd it is more like the original.
1,Violent and inappropriate,"A very disappointing sequel and nothing like the original! This was dark, violent, and had inappropriate themes. Only watched 40 minutes of it and then gave up as it was too depressing. Is this what we are showing children as entertainment? Not good."
2,"Poor, Cliched, and Unnecessary. But kids won't care!","Pixar has rivaled, even surpassed the best that Disney, Dreamworks, and Blue Sky Studios has to offer. The only studio that can rival it in brilliant, smart, fun, family-friendly cartoons is perhaps Studio Ghibli.But Cars 2 is Pixar's first misstep. An unnecessary sequel with little humor, cliched characters, poor voicework from Larry the Cable Guy and Owen, and lots and lots of ""cheese"".It's one of those mindless parodies of James Bond that has to come along once in a while.Having said that, kids love this movie, and I'm sure they don't care about plot holes, poor characters, and Duex et Machinas!In summary: Cars 2 is a lemon, but KID'S WON'T CARE at all! They'll love it!"
3,Sequel's curse,"As much as our entire family loved the first installment of Cars, we were rather disappointed with Cars 2. In plain words, it feels like mixed salad - too many ingredients i.e. characters, the plot is not clear, and the dialogue is rather poor. That said, I will probably not buy the third installment of ""Cars."""
2,Rented but returned early,"We received Cars 2 as a DVD rental from another place (outside of Amazon). My 2 1/2 year old grandson devours the original Cars and has watched it perhaps 30 times. He lost interest in Cars 2 in the first 15 minutes. I have to admit it didn't hold my interest either. This is such a radical departure from the original Cars. I think the producer went too far allowing this story line to depart so much from the strong character focus of Cars. Cars 2 also seemed loud, dark, and flashy.This may have been a good video done on it's own but as a sequel I think it fails.We turned it off and returned the disk without watching it all the way through."
1,Very disappointing! Not an upbeat kids movie!,"This movie starts out with a scene with guns, bombs, etc. It is horrible. Not for little kids at all! The first movie was so lighthearted and endearing. This one attempts to be a James Bond movie....which doesn't work for little kids! Very disappointed."
2,Lame,"This is a typical garbage Hollywood film. The first Cars movies was totally awesome and this movie does it no justice at all. Just a movie taking cheap shots at the oil industry. This seems to be a theme with movies now though (portraying corporations or people as evil. Wall E, Bee Movie, Avatar). Had high hopes for this movie but it didn't entertain my kids at all. They turned it off and popped on Spiderman on netflix. Too bad......"
5,Great Film,"This is really great CD, it's better than the last Cars. It's worth the money to get this one. It's really great."
2,GREAT MOVIE ROTTEN DVD,"I do not have a Blu-Ray player, but the price was good so I bought this combo, But the DVD was not good!!! It was constantly pausing and generally ruined the movie. I sold it to a friend with a Blu-Ray and those discs worked fine but the DVD didn't work any better on his DVD player then mine. I do not expect the DVD single to be any better and I will not be buying one any time soon."
4,Entertaining. Different...but good,"While we were disappointed that Radiator Springs was barely in this movie, we had read enough reviews to not be shocked at the total change in Cars 2. The first Cars is one of our favorite movies. The children love it. Cars 2 was different. It wasn't as good, nor as almost-tear-jerking as the first one. It was a bit more...shallow. Seems like the characters didn't have much depth, but it's still greatly entertaining. I'm not really understanding the one and two-star ratings here. But I also know a LOT of people were disappointed. At least there are a couple of appearances by Sally and the rest in Radiator Springs and elsewhere in the movie (minus Doc, of course)."
3,Running on fumes,"Even though I think the first Cars is one of the weakest Pixar films, at least it has some really funny moments and a story with more in mind than just blowing stuff up. I don't think we laughed more than a few times with Cars 2. The plot is too complex for younger kids and there is more action than you can or will want to handle. It feels more like a Dreamworks movie than one made by the great Pixar. It's not all bad though. The spy element played like a decent a Bond flick and the animation is of high quality as expected. You know it can't be good when the 5 minute Toy Story short shown before Cars 2 is actually better than movie you paid to see."
1,"Crash, Boom, Splash!","Likely, your Child will enjoy toy cars in the bathtub more than they will this film and toys can always be played with, right? Why make the $20 investment in a movie about cars when you can buy $1 toy cars that will suffice as fun for many years to come? Just a valid thought from an avid movie-goer. I found the film pretty-yet full of dull moments. The C-word was used at least three times. I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!"
2,3d movie not working,i bought the 5 disc combo and all the movies work but one the 3d disc which is the whole reason i bought it. took it out of case and it had circle scratches on it. It will play but skips most of the time. Other than that the other disc are fine and working good.
1,terrible for children,"I was very surprised by the amount of automobile ""deaths"" and threat of ""deaths"" in the film. This is violent and terrible to show a 4 year old and having to explain about the good cars versus the bad cars. Please don't watch this movie if you care about your young ones."
1,Remember the Hindenberg?,"Pixar has been the Wonder Child of 21st Century animation with a huge string of hits and only a few mis-steps along the way. I own just about all of them. Cars 1 was brilliant in plot, character development, backstory, technology, and practically perfect in every way.After being teased for 2 years and waiting with baited breath for this must see, when this dog landed (no offense to dogs) it blew up and stunk like a wet one. How could anybody screw up a franchise this badly?No redeeming value at all and was a complete waste of celluloid--use 2 hours of your time watching paint peel and you'll get more out of it! Sorry Pixar/Disney....."
5,that do good job,get the movebe for time. the do there job on time. i well buy form them dvd or games. i like them
4,kids like it,"Has a ""oil companies are corrupt"" type of story to it, but if you don't mind that it is fun. Not as good as the first one (but not very many sequels are). This one is more about Mater than about Lightning McQueen compared to the first one. The spy angel is certainly exciting."
4,Very Cute,Mater is always funny with Larry the cable guy's voice. I hope that there are more Cars movies in the future.
1,Childs Movie filled with Violence.,My two year old grandson loved it was glued to it and was taking in all the violence. I personally did not like it as I could not relate to it at all.
4,Liked it,"I like the duality of the message the movie tried to convey, not the environmental one, but the one where McQueen realizes he shouldn't try to change his friend but also where Mater realizes that his antics are hurtful. Who hasn't known someone who they wish would act differently while in public? As far as the violence it is really not any more prominent than in any other Pixar film, in Nemo the mother and his hundreds of siblings are all murdered in the first ten minutes. No this movie is not UP but it does tell a fun story and it tells it well. Who hasn't imagined cars as people? This movie is Pixar's interpretation of what this world would look like and I personally enjoyed it. To me Pixar is about making a story the creators want to watch and hoping others also want to watch, unfortunately this was not to everyone's taste but I applaud Pixar for continuing the franchise and cannot wait to see Planes when it is released."
1,Horribly Political,"This is a hollywood left wing enviro movie. It was a huge disappointment for me and my wife, the kids certainly were not as entertained as they were with the original Cars. These wizards of smart should keep politics out of making family movies. Tedious and boring."
2,Terrible movie,"The only reason I don't give it one star is the animation, which is impressive (as one would expect from Pixar). Other than this, the movie is a bomb. First off, I was shocked at the level of violence in the movie. It is, IMO, not appropriate for little kids. If your kids are a little bit older, then fine, but the older kids will probably be turned off by the weak and poorly-executed storyline. As far as the story goes, this is a really stupid movie; probably the worst Pixar movie ever (with the possible exception of Wall-E). Lightning McQueen is a minor character; the main focus is on Mader, who is amusing in small doses but who's bumpkin routine gets old very quickly.It's really disgraceful to see them put out such trash to ride on the coat-tails of such a wonderful initial movie.So not recommended."
2,My son yawned halfway through the movie,"I watched this in the theatre with my four and half year old son. While we had enjoyed Cars at home, this time we were disappointed. One might argue the movie is a bit too violent and sinister for kids his age but even as an adult I found the movie to be dreary - little substance under the fancy wrapping paper of high end graphics.There is a plot and an agenda but the presentation fails to deliver. My son didn't like the movie at all. This was a very different experience from watching Bugs Life, Monsters Inc and Toy Story with him."
1,Wasn't what I ordered,"I ordered the blu-ray and dvd combo pack. Instead I got the blu-ray and ""digital copy"" which doesn't work in dvd players."
1,They killed a good story,"I was very disappointed with this movie. My son was a huge fan of Cars until he watched Cars 2. The story line is very hard to follow for kids and then there are guns, killing, drinking... This movie is just awful! I don't think the people writing this movies have kids.This movie is just a terrible influence on children. I don't care what the final message is if on the way they had to use tons of guns, kill someone and get drunk!"
1,VERY disappointed 5 and 3 year old!!!,"Both my kids are huge fans of Cars, the first movie, toys and books!They could not wait for this movie, it was practically a count down to go see it. They were sadly disappointed and said they did not like it at all. It was hard for them to follow. There were cars killed off. They were trying to kill Mcqueen and Towmater, my kids favorite characters. Which saddened both my kids and induced anxiety in them. The main characters from the last movie had very brief parts this time. They could have done so much more here! I am not sure what they were thinking. They lost more fans here than gained. The politcal issue of alternate fuel is lost on the little kiddo's as it should be! VERY DIAPPOINTED to say the least! Wish I could give it zero stars!"
1,"E Tu, Pixar?","When I want kids to see an animation, I hope that they can be kids and enjoy their lives. They have so many more stresses these days than (in many ways) we did. I do not want lil ones having propaganda tossed at them. Pixar used to be a safe haven from that. No more, sadly. Kids get plenty of propaganda at school. Can't we give them a break and let them ""make believe"" that the world is not going to blow up just because they used gasoline to drive to granny's?"
2,Not what I thought it would be...,"My son and I love Cars, and so I thought Cars 2 would be of the same quality. I never expected it to be as violent. It came out a while ago, so I honestly don't remember the storyline. Anyway, minus the guns and violence, it was decent. I think there could have been another movie I would have rather purchased.Deb"
5,Good movie. Scarier than the first one.,"This movie is very similar to the first one, but has an actual bad guy. It's a little bit darker of a movie than Cars 1."
3,Not good,I choose this rating not because of the movie. The movie is wonderful! Half way through the movie the disc started skipping. I wasn't pleased with that I doubt I'll buy used dvd's again.
3,A good cartoon turned violent,"I liked the original cars movie for the kids, an even the Mater's total tales shorts. But unfortunately I found myself having to explain to a 6 and 3 year old why cars were being killed (one in a metal compactor, one whose oil is show splattered on the camera, the rest set on fire by laser beams) and why they were trying to kill Lightnening McQueen. It was a good movie, but it has themes more apropriate for older kids, so be prepared for that because I wasn't."
4,Better than the 1st!,"I actually really like the James Bond-esk thing they did with this movie. I prefer it over the first one personally. My daughter likes both movies, but I definitely think this one is better than the original."
3,Mixed feelings,"My kids are big fan of Cars which is also one my favorite movie. However Cars 2 doesn't fall in that category. It's not bad, but I find it to be a bit too much violent and the plot is not that easy for young kids. Don't get me wrong, they still love it but as a parent, I'm not sure about the quality and the approach of the message behind the movie."
2,cars 2,I received very fast shipping. The CD came in very good shape. I did not care for cars 2. I have cars 1 & enjoy it very much.
5,AMAZING,"I received my movie in 2 days, looking brand new, packaged in shrink wrap. I WILL be ordering more movies from here in the future!"
1,A Terrible Disappointment,"I saw Cars 2 in the theaters with my children, all of whom are 10 and under. We loved the first ""Cars"" film and have the PlayStation game for it. I really looked forward to the sequel and was badly disappointed. The plot was thin and gimmicky, the focus on Mater quickly became tiresome and while the animation was amazing, it was a difficult movie for children to follow. The box office figures don't show it, but Pixar laid an egg with this one.Not recommended."
3,Not as entertaining as the first...,"Not as entertaining as the first but the kids might still enjoy it. The overall plot was bland and it had a very political agenda feel to it, which I believe has no place in children movies. Both of my kids still prefer to watch the first over the second, but they still watch it on occasion, and even giggle at a few parts in the movie."
2,Too Scary for My Two Year Old,"I got the movie because my two year old son loves to play with the toy cars from the movie. It never even crossed my mind that a movie from which his favorite toys were created and from the makers of Toy Story and Cars 1 would create a movie that I would have to turn off after 30 minutes, but after watching for a half house, my son told us, ""I scared. I scared"" and we had to turn the movie off.I, on the other hand loved the movie. I could do without the political message about alternative energy, but overall, I was satisfied. I'd give the movie 4 stars, but not getting to enjoy it with my son cuts the rating in half. We will watch it together when he gets a bit older."
2,Pixar's First Miss.,"If you are an adult and like James Bond movies with a touch of Transformers action, you'll like Cars 2. For everybody else, this movie was just wrong. As has been said by other reviewers, this movie drops everything good about the original one: the characters, the setting, the mood, the pace, the soul. My five- and three-year old daughters -- great fans of the first installment -- got up and walked away 20 minutes into the movie. Looks good, but no soul."
2,"good graphics, good cast, epic failure of a storyline","In cars I Mater provided comic relief against the backdrop of the melancholy abandoned/dying town, grumpy Doc, worried Sally. In Mater's tall tales it was a ""let's be silly with Mater!"" -- there was no pretense of substance. So this was like a story from Mater's Tall Tales stretched into a feature length film. The story line was silly at best, and incoherent at worst.

2,This movie was not as good as Cars,"I really didnt' like this movie.I can't put my finger on exactly what I didn't like about it, whether it was the silly plot, or the heavy handed message, but it just didn't do it for me. I liked Tangled much better."
2,Lacking in Bonus features,"I buy Blu-ray and DVD discs mainly for the bonus features; having the movie was a side benefit.Unfortunately for Cars 2 (Two-Disc Blu-ray / DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging), there is virtually no bonus features. The only things included on the discs are director's commentary and two shorts.Personally, I think this combo set was not worth the price that I paid for it."
2,Nothing like the first (more violence),"It was nothing like the first movie. This movie was way too violent to be rate G. Guns, spies, killing... my kids should not have watched this."
3,"Cars 2 ok, Cars 1 better!","We enjoyed Cars 2, but comparing it with the first one, definitely enjoyed #1 for our kids. We thought the amount of bullets, missiles, fighting was a bit much for our son (4). The pace of the first cars was definitely more his speed."
2,Oh Pixar,"The sequel to such a loved movie was definitely a letdown when compared to the original and other Pixar titles. My son (age 5) loves it however I thought it was just ok. There isn't any discussion as to where Doc went or why, that is left up to the viewer to notice and figure out. I thought the amount of car on car violence was a bit high for Pixar movie as well. The plot was too complicated for kids to really understand and the usual nod to the adults Pixar is famous for was missing. I found it to be disappointing which is a rarity for a Pixar movie in our house."
4,Enjoyable,I see all the negative reviews and yes there were parts that aimed for the older crowd like basically every kids movie out there now. My 5 year old daughter loved it though and laughed threw the movie. She knows bad guys and good guys and was able to grasp most of the story but bottom line she liked it and so did I.
2,Not as good as the first.,I saw this with my boyfriend and his son.I loved the first car movie. It was more realize down home charm that reminded me of those old Disney car/house/hat cartoons. But this movie was painful. Far to much high tech fantasy for me and it lost its basic roots. The 7 yr we saw it was liked it but thought the first one was much better as well. And my guy hated it! Very cheesy. The only good point is that the animation was amazing and it kept the main voice actors. Out of all the pixar movies this was my least favorite.
1,Not the HD version,"They charge you 14.99 for the movie to download on your TV but when you go to watch it, you'll find out it is not the HD version and they never give you a choice between the two.If you want the HD version you have to rent it for 4.99.Kinda stupid they bilk their customers like this."
5,Great Product,"I found out about this supplement through a body building magazine that I was reading at my friends house. Anyways I've been on it for 3 days but I seen awesome results the first time i took it! I took two pills about an hour before my workout and i had one of the best workouts I've had in a long time. Recovery times are incredible and my pump is off the hook. I didn't need almost any rest and i could push harder with more weight over and over again without getting tired. when I was done with my workout my pump was off the charts i could not believe my eyes, I thought this stuff was a steroid lol but all it is its an amino acid and yes I'm so glad i got it. Hope this helps."

2,A Techno Not So Thrilling,"This is another of those novels where the real star appears to be the technology - in this case the AV-8 Harrier as flown by the U.S. Marines. As is often the case, the human characters by comparision are all rather 2 dimensional and overshadowed by the technology and the forward movement of the plot. Written in 1987, this book was rapidly pushed into irrelevance by the collapse of the Soviet Unio and Irag's invasion of Kuwait launching the first war with Iraq. Finally, the portrayal of the Saudi people and leadership seem especially dated today though they are not without elements of truth they come of as exxaggerated strictly for effect."
4,Great First Book!,"First Person? An Assassin? Who'd have thought I would so completely love both? FOR THE LOVE OF is a fast, fun, entertaining read that I Was surprised to find absorbing and heartrending at times. Mac, the heroine, truly captured my interest and my emotion. A well drawn out character that had me rooting and scheming right alongside her. Bravo and well done, Ms. Surbeck. I will be looking forward to future offerings from you."

5,A great thriller!,"""The Wrong Man"" is wonderful, it deserves five stars. The movie stars Henry Fonda and Vera Miles. They are both great actors. This film is actually true. It is a thriller but it is also a drama. An excellent Hitchcock film. Go see it!"
3,Ever Wanted to Wake Up from a Bad Dream?,"The plot of this film was a recurring nightmare that Alfred Hitchcock apparently tried to get out of his system with a starkly documentary type of movie that didn't go down too well with audiences. It's a tedious reworking of a case of mistaken identity in a robbery prosecution in New York City, entirely devoid of any of the glamour or wit that Hitchcock usually used to mask his obsessions. ""The Wrong Man"" might have been the subtitle of several of Hitchcock's films, and he laid his worst fears on the line with this one. Henry Fonda, the hapless musician victim, is reduced to praying for miracle to get out the trap, and one turns up, an echo of Hitchcock's Catholic upbringing. In the context of Hitchcock's other work it's an interesting couple of hours, but only in that context."
4,A Strong Assemblance of Hitchcock,"The wrong man is a favorite theme of Alfred Hitchcock, but in all other films, the wrong man was on the run. In ""The Wrong Man"", Henry Fonda plays an ordinary working man and a family man falsely accused of assault and robbery. The storyline is a narrow and concentrated network of ideas and quite effective.This is the kind of Hitchcock that is not expected, and that makes it a Hitchcock. It is delivered in a very serious tone. Taken from an actual story of a mistaken identity, the wrong man's wife (played by Vera Miles) has all to do to hang on to the belief of innocence.A must for Hitchcock fans."
2,Not sure what other people are seeing,"I'm on a run of watching the movies of the great Alfred Hitchcock. However, this movie is very slow, dull, and doesn't feel like a typical ""Hitch"" movie. It plays more like a mediocre episode from the Alfred Hitchcock hour tv show. Fonda's performance is very mundane, and there's little power in the dialogue he's provided. Great Hitchcock editing, pacing and camera angles are almost entirely absent. The story is not compelling. One can see that the wife's psychological trauma is designed to be the whole emotional hook for the movie, yet it comes out flat with a feeling of little credibility. The sentimental moral tone is more aligned with a Little House on the Prairie episode than a gripping suspense movie. Thumbs firmly down."
5,Neat Exercise in Hitchcock Neo Realism,"Hitchcock wanted Vera Miles to be Madeleine in Vertigo. She's very beautiful in this movie. Her acting is superb. I remember seeing this movie when I was around 15 and I was actually scared for her character when she starts losing her mind in the middle of the story.Some people on here were dismissive of the scenes where she is losing her mind, but I generally found them heartbreaking.I also found the Catholic symbolism to be very effective."
4,GREAT Cd!,"If you love the Charlie Daniels band, you will LOVE this cd. I must strongly disagree that Powder Keg is the only good song on this cd. A cd like this will make you think of good times and the weekend!"
2,Second Listen,"Sorry Charlie, not a real great one. The best track on this album is POWDER KEG. Like CD says in the ROOTS REMAIN boxed set, ""...it kinda got lost in the shuffle."" Best thing to do is to buy the CD at the lowest price possible for the sake of listening to POWDER KEG."
1,boring,"all american rock band make the same old sh*t.- fantastic dark cover ( i admit)- overproduce album- same guitars-singer who come from the "" maynard james keenan schools'""all their song are so boring and without lifeI WILL CONTIINUE TO WRITE MY OWN SONGS , I MAYBE FRENCH BUT I TRY TO MAKE SOMETHING NEW"
4,nice,"It's remarkable what these two 18-year-olds can do. This record shows great musical craftsmanship and composition skills.""Strange We Should Meet Here"" is a remarkable debut. This album has some stand-out moments. Idiot Pilot is still fairly immature, but they have some potential. They are surprisingly unknown despite being on a major record label."
3,The Screaming Ruins It,"Like many have stated here before me, this is an amazing album - instrumentally. If you're a fan of Radiohead or anything Tom Yorke influenced, then you will dig it. However, there is one glaring issue with these guys that's this reviewer is unable to ignore: the screaming.Imagine if you were listening to a brand new Radiohead song and then all of a sudden some guy started screaming indistinguishably over top of the music, and that's Idiot Pilot. If they would cut out the terrible screaming then I'd be inclined to recommend this album to almost anyone because it's almost amazing, were it not for that."
4,From a Father,"Tom T. Hall may be the Story Teller, but Jimmy Dean has to be a close second. In fact, while Hall's story's most often make you laugh, Dean is the one who really gets to the ""heart"" of the matter. As the father of two little girls, ""TO a Sleeping Beauty"" has a very specail place in my heart and puts a lump in my throat. THe other songs are great too, but for a father of little girls, nothing hits me like that song."
5,Fantastic,This is an amazing book. I could sit for hours and stare at the wonderful photography. It is a visual masterpiece!
5,Another great one by Hospital,"I'm a fan so I think all hers are great (though her short stories don't inspire as much). When you finish you'll sit back and say ""can you believe that?!"" Surprise ending teaches that in life things may not always be what you think. The family dynamics and descriptions are so vivid you feel as if you have been injected with emotion"

3,celery leaf and stalk,"I used this in a cooked dish that I make. I soaked them first and found that they tasted okay. They don't work as well as fresh celery, but they do work in a bind."
3,not bad,This was a ok story but again nothing that left me spooked or evenmidly curious about whats on the next page. It's ok to pass a boring dayon a rainy day or something but nothing exciting to brag about.
4,hauntings,I haven't finished this book yet but it is very good. Unlike some people this family understands that they have a haunted house and are very willing to share that information. As the story goes on they learn more about what and who is haunting their house and they do what they can to help the ghosts. They are basically comfortable living with their ghosts.
2,Not Good.,"A. Wilder must have been on some heavy drugs or something. This book started off fairly decent, then progressivly worse and worse. That astral BS simply turned me off completely. Grave's End was a lot better.."
1,house of spirits and whispers,"i was excited to read this book , it sounded very exciting.however, after reading this very short book.i felt it was not really exciting at all.it was quite expensive for kindle, like 10.00.the book had large print and was quite short.i read it extremely fast , it wasnt that good and i was disapointed it was not alot of interesting stories,i wouldnt recommend it,too short and not exciting either.thats my review"
4,Enjoyable read.,"Well written, relayed her experienced well, although she would lose me when she got into ""astral projection""."
3,"Not a bad story, but....","The story isn't bad, but I thought the author came across as somewhat ""flaky"", thus making the story less believable."
5,Thrill ride experience in book form,"Very few books in this genre actually scare me. This book is one of the rare finds that truly does hold the reader captive from one heart pounding chapter to the next.From the opening pages of Chapter 1 right through the end of the book, Annie Wilder delivers a fantastic true account of her experiences with the paranormal as it takes residence in her dream home.I would reccomend this book to anyone that wants a genuine scare and doesn't mind looking over their shoulder for some time after reading it."
3,"Ok book, could have been better","I was anticipating reading this book, but when I got it and started reading, I realized the book needed a lot editing. Ms. Wilder did jump all over the place and didn't explain some relationships very well. Also, I don't know if it's just me, but Ms. Wilder seemed to be dabbling in a lot of strange things and I wonder if some of this was made up or she was wishing too hard for a ghost???? I wish Ms. Wilder would have included pictures of the house, rather than just floor plan drawings. Anyway, decent book, but not great!"
2,Not believable,"I've read many books of this genre, and this is so far the one I dislike the most. I'm not saying the author is a bad writer, she is very good at telling stories and sounds like a nice person. However, this book has very few accounts of real haunts. She considers dreams as real accounts or out-of-body experiences, which in my opinion are still just dreams. From the beginning it felt like she was expecting to find ghosts from day one and most of her perception seem like she truly wants to see something happen, like she's trying too hard. Also, she just assumes, also from day one, that the house is haunted by the last owner who just died. It seems like wishful thinking to me, I mean, it's an old house, it's bound be have many deaths in its history, and one can get really imaginative living in it.I believe and like to read about the supernatural, but this book didn't convince me one bit."
2,"Looses steam, forced","This book starts off well enough, with the author buying a house that has some oddities about it. But then, the book fails to gel, and becomes progressively disjointed. After several chapters of recounted dreams presented as occurances, I gave up and didn't finish it.My impression is that the author really wanted to write a book, and she was also into ghosts, so she decided to start with a true life ghost story. The only problem: her material is thin. She starts off well enough, moving into a house with some creepy atmosphere. But what follows is mostly dreams, anecdotes about noisy pipes and other settling noises and accounts of people who 'felt something'. I never became convinced that the house was really haunted, or just that she really wanted it to be haunted.Borrow this, if you have a lot of patience for amateur writing and efforts, and want to explore every possible ghost story. It's too insubstantial an effort for me to recommend as a purchase."
3,House of woo-woo,"I found Wilder's account interesting not so much for the ghost story as for her complete credulity and confidence in her own abilities-- not only to understand spiritual entities, but to *control* them.She assumes spirits respond to her every thought and action, protect her home and family as requested, and go away when she says. Wilder always thinks she's accurately perceived and interpreted the spiritual ""energy"" in her home; she believes without hesitation pretty much anything she's told about the supposed haunting; and she assumes her dreams are real. She's awesome, but not really in a positive way-- more in a ""good god, Annie, your hubris is absolutely outrageous"" kind of way.The visual phenomena she describes aren't uncommon-- many people see geometric light shapes and patterns when half-awake-- there are medical explanations for that (Wilder thinks the lights are sent to teach her something in the spiritual realm)."
2,Bland as white rice,"I heard the author on a podcast and immediately bought the book. Mistake. It's so boring it just about put me to sleep. There were two fatal flaws.First, there was no suspense, no creepiness, no fear. La la la, a ghost tried to get in my bed, la la la, whispers from the radiators, la la la, pounding in the walls. Ho hum. The second major problem was that we know so little about the house's inhabitants. Everyone besides the author is a mere prop, a cardboard cutout. It's hard to care about what happens when there's no one to care about it happening to.All in all, it's a poorly done treatment of what could have been a fascinating story."
3,So so,"From Hastings, found the locations and descriptions a little off. Makes me wonder about the story. I WENT to school at both the elementary and middle school (still standing but re purposed). The church was removed and rebuilt at another location not demolished."
2,"Well-written, but not scary. . . . .","The word ""haunted"" always makes a ghost story sound terrifying. . . but in this case, the story wasn't really very scary at all. The author writes a first-person story of her haunted house experience, and also discusses what was happening in her family and personal life to give more interest to the characters. While I feel it was an interesting tale, with some ""paranormal"" experiences, most of the time, I was not at all frightened. The author is very open to para-psychology and she herself was not really frightened most of the time, and seemed to harbor a belief that the spirits were benign in her home. It was an interesting story, but if you don't share the author's openness to other beliefs systems, she may come off as somewhat hokey. Some suspense, but little terror. It was, however, extremely well-written. If you are looking for a terrifying ghost experience, this is not your story. If you want a reasonably factual account of paranormal activity, this is it."
2,Yikes! (Not in a Good Way),"I couldn't get through this one. I am fascinated by the subject matter, but the author's presentation was weak and sadly unbelievable. I much preferred Elaine Mercado's ""Grave's End."""
3,Little Nutty,"I saw a program on TV about Annie Wilder and her house - seemed interesting so I purchased both of her books. This book was interesting regarding the house and its invisible occupants UNTIL -- she lost me when she said she saw her dead cat on the roof and went to the upstairs bedroom and reached THROUGH the glass with her hand and patted the cat - and then REALLY lost me when she communed with her dead irish grandmother who told her that she was late for lunch with the other dead relatives. LUNCH - really? I will read the other book because I already purchased it, but Wilder's credibility is pretty much shot over those two incidents. I've had paranormal experiences but I've never been able to reach THROUGH glass. Buy it if you are curious but don't expect more than cartoon animation in some places."
2,"just call it ""the thumper""","Although this heater does provide nice warmth, be forewarned, don't put in it a bedroom you intend to sleep in? The steel box thumps very loudly as the unit heats up and as it cools down. I wouldn't reccommend it unless you don't mind noise when you sleep."
1,Look Elsewhere,"I purchased this unit in the fall of '06 and waited until now in order to give it a fair appraisal. In all fairness, it stinks! I've had to bypass the thermostat since it simply is of no use. The mechanism is so rudimentary as to be completely useless in regulating the temperature. Worse still, the internal thermal shutoff cuts the unit off well before it has any chance to do anything and it never recovers unless you unplug the unit and leave it be for variable and unpredictable periods of time. The solution to that not so little inconvenience was to replace the thermal switch with one rated to recover after a 15 degree dip in temp. I guess the point is: Unless you're handy and comfortable with doing mods on this unit, look into something else!!!!"
2,Only so-so,"It worked well for the first winter, but seem the internal thermostat is a bit weak and it only works occasionally now. The place I bought it from on Amazon (ace hardware outlet) could only refer me to Marvin for help."
2,switch burnout,"I liked the thin design of this prodcut. I perfect fit for under a window that gets a bit cold. My first panel lasted 1 1/2 winters then the on/off switch wouldn't toggle. It appears the heat melted or caused the malfunction. I thought perhaps I just had a defective part and ordered another replacement panel. I didn't have the receipt to try to return under warranty, and the shipping cost would eat into the cost for just replacing the whole thing. Well, the second panel is on its second winter and the toggle switch is getting stuck again. It seems to do this when the panel is running for several hours. Even if I turn off the panel and try again the next day, I can tell the toggle switch is sticking and will eventually fail as well.I decided to find another type of electric floor heater that is fanless, a Lasko. The price was less expensive, but it has a digital thermostat and not a mechanical power switch."
3,Magnum Finale,"Clint Eastwood has a little pop-culture fun in this somewhat cartoonish Dirty Harry outing. ""The Dead Pool"" (1988) is a slight improvement over the unpleasantness of ""The Enforcer"" and ""Sudden Impact,"" but Inspector Harry Callahan no longer resembles the cinematic icon depicted in director Don Siegel's 1971 classic. Still, we get an inventive car chase, a few memorable Clint one-liners, and a stronger-than-average cast (Liam Neeson, Patricia Clarkson, Evan C. Kim, Jim Carrey). Running only 91 minutes, the film moves at a good clip until stumbling at the finish line. It's a ludicrous climax as Harry blows away his final psychopath with a hand-held harpoon gun. Though a commercial success, ""The Dead Pool"" lacked the box-office firepower of its predecessors and Eastwood wisely bid adieu to his most famous character."
3,Only OK. The weakest Dirty Harry flick.,"This one was a disappointment. Part of it is slapstick (the ""car"" chase scene) and it is just not a particularly good flick. I gave it the third star because I like Clint Eastwood so much and always enjoy his acting, but really, this one is a disappointment."
2,Clint Looked Dead in This One.,"Viewed: 8/03, 6/05Rate: 36/05: Not a great Dirty Harry picture, The Deal Pool is very mundane and same old-same old. It lacks the charm and the comedy found from the last film Sudden Impact. Moreover, it doesn't have that Clint Eastwood feel. The Deal Pool is not as great as Dirty Harry and Sudden Impact but just boring as Magnum Force and The Enforcer. I see a fine role for Liam Neeson and a fair cameo from Jim Carrey. Overall, it was a nice run for the Dirty Harry films by finishing out with The Dead Pool. There is a vintage line from Harry Callhan: ""Maybe I'll start my own dead pool... and put you on it."""
2,"A good movie, but nothing else . . .","This was the fourth, and final, sequel to the ""Dirty Harry"" series and it can be understandable why Clint Eastwood finally decided to put the old boy to rest. While it is not a bad movie, the movie itself wasn't anything groundbreaking. ""Dirty Harry"" was a groundbreaking movie, and the first three sequels had a good plot, subplot, or comedy. This movie only had the comedy, as the subplots are very 1 dimensional. A very fun, but could have easily been the same movie without ""Harry Callahan"" and his classic one-liners. Eastwood could have played any type of character in this movie, or not even had it starring him at all. If you have never seen a ""Dirty Harry"" film, then please get the original film or even ""Magnum Force"" to really understand the character. This movie adds to the ""amazing adventurers"", but it may not explain why Dirty Harry was so great. A great movie, but needed a whole lot more."
5,Who doesn't like Dirty Harry?,"Perhaps one of the weaker movies in the series, who wouldn't delight in watching the toy car chase scene? It's worth the price of admission just to see that."
4,Great Ending to a Great Character,"Clint Eastwood appears for the last time as Dirty Harry. Here he is on a list of dead celebrities, and doesnot want the attention. Watch for Jim Carrey(going under the name of James Carrey) As the first killed celebrity. Carrey appeared in one more Eastwood movie. And Liam Neeson during his supporting role days."
2,The Dead Pool,"First of all, I want you to know that I wrote reviews for Dirty Harry 1-4.The fourth sequel to the 1971 Don Siegel action thriller is not too bad. There are many action scences that I find appealing. Eastwood is great in this Dirty Harry movie."
4,"Dirty Harry's last movie, Death Pool","The Death Pool was a very good movie and will be enjoyed by any Dirty Harry fan or anybody looking for a good cop movie. Harry investigates a strange Game played by a horror film director (Liam Neeson) The object of the game, played by the director and members of his crew, is to guess what celebrity will die first. As people keep dropping from his list, Harry finds that he is on the list. He rushes to find the killer, whoever he is, before he too is a victim of the death pool. Cameo appearance by a young ""James"" Carey, as he is called in the credits, is as a druggy rocker."
4,"The final ""Dirty Harry"" goes out with a bang","Fourth sequel to 1971's ""Dirty Harry"" has Harry tracking a psycho whose celebrity ""death list"" includes himself - and all the other celebrities listed with him are dropping dead. He now has a competent Chinese-American partner (Evan C. Kim) and the attentions of a pushy reporter (Patricia Clarkson) who wants his story - fame and publicity for her if he suddenly dies. That's probably why he won't give it to her. He's also dodging bullets from the henchmen of a mob boss he put away. Busy guy. More fun than ""Sudden Impact"", which was often unpleasant and didn't really feel like a ""Dirty Harry"" anyway. Check out Jim Carrey as a junkie rock star who mimes to Guns'n Roses. This is the only ""Dirty Harry"" movie where Albert Popwell doesn't appear; in each of the previous four films he plays a different character each time. Harry has some great dialogue here and this is a fine wrap up for the series."
4,"The Dead Pool, Rocks. Litteraly","With Jim Carry (unknown at the time) playing a Rock Star, and the members of Guns and Roses at the funeral scene, I'd have to say... the Dead Pool Rocks!"
3,Inexpensive and amusing,"First, it's an adventure film with a sense of humor and a decent plot and Clint Eastwood puts on a fine performance as Dirty Harry and obtains some good support from the cast. It's one of the better Dirty Harry films and good copies can be cheaply obtained. It's a fun film and at the end of a long day when you're tired and need to unwind and both your TV and DVD player can automatically shut off then it can also put you to sleep pretty quickly. I have a core of these films which are used over the year. Like the Dead Pool they are okay but they aren't going to keep your attention all through the film like The Dresser. The Dead Pool is an amusing story. It's the way a cash cow should be done. If that's okay with you buy second hand. The market is flooded with these DVDs."
5,great condition,"I bought this movie for my dad's birthday. The disc itself was in fantastic condition. The case had a slice in in, but i didnt mind, since it didnt harm the movie.I would highly recommend this movie, even though ive never been for those older movies. but this one i will always remember because of clint eastwood, he adds a rough but lovable character as always:)"
4,Do You Have Any Kids? Lucky For Them,"All the Dirty Harry movies in my opinion were cult classics. This one was good, but didn't grab me quite as much as the rest. There still were a few good one-liners in it."
3,Time to retire the role.,"I am a big Eastwood fan and like the Dirty Harry series, however, the fifth one should not have been made. Clint is very old and he looks very tired of playing the role. He was in his prime during the 70s! But Dirty Harry in the 80s just doesn't match up right? The plot of the story is that he is investigating a bunch of murders and finds out that he is in this game called the Dead Pool and his name is on the list. Jim Carrey plays a Herion addict which that I can believe. But the over all movie was just plain boring. It seems like they have lighten up the character sine Eastwood is older."
3,"OK, BUT IT'S LOST A LOT OF ITS EXCITEMENT BY THIS POINT","THIS TIME, HARRY CALLAHAN IS BACK TO INVESTIGATE A SERIES OF CELEBRITY MURDERS LINKED TO A LIST CALLED THE DEAD POOL, WHICH HAS HIS NAME ON IT. HAS SOME OK ACTION AND A FEW GOOD SPOTS [NAMELY THE CHASE BETWEEN DIRTY HARRY AND A BOMBED TOY CAR], BUT CLINT EASTWOOD HAD BEGINED TO AGE BY THE TIME THIS FOURTH SEQUEL CAME AROUND. I STILL HAVEN'T SEEN THE OTHER THREE SEQUELS, BUT THIS SURELY DOESN'T MEASURE UP WITH THE ORIGINAL. THIS ONE EVEN HAS A SENSE OF HUMOR, AND THIS ONE IS PRETTY LIGHTHEARTED COMPARED TO THE FIRST MOVIE, WHICH I DID SEE. CLINT EASTWOOD'S PERFORMANCE IS THE MAIN THING KEEPING THIS ONE GOING. OTHERWISE, THIS IS A PRETTY MEDIOCRE SEQUEL. LOOK FOR AN APPEARANCE BY A YOUNGER JIM CARREY AS A DRUG ADDICTED ROCK SINGER."
3,Is The Title Right?,"I was not sure about the movie. All that happens is people die and complain. But where is the pool? I saw plenty of water by the bridge but nobody died in a pool, just typewriters and yelling in the dark. They say Harry was dirty, but he looked very clean and nice, mostly in suits with skinny ties; other people have funny long hair in back, but short on top. He and the girl were scared, but they didn't have a pool anyway to swim. I think the scary yelling killer would be title much better."
4,Average Eastwood,"This is an alright Dirty Harry flick. It is good for at least one viewing if you like Clint as Harry and it also has Liam Neeson, with a short cameo by Jim Carry as a druggie rockstar that is kind of amusing."
2,Don't waste your money,"Both stars go to the first track, Public Image, one of the best songs of the 70's. Everything else is truly horrible. Lydon's voice is unbearably annoying throughout much of the CD. And remember, these are their best songs too."
2,Falls together as whole,"Public Image, Death Disco, Memories, Careering, Flowers Of Romance. Fantastic songs. Classics. This Is Not A Love Song. A good song. But when 'Rise' kicks off the album falls together to 80's radio pop...terrible. Buy one of the early albums instead..."
1,Hey you! Don't buy this! It's no good!,"What a silly little man John Lydon was. He took this quasi-band and did not know what direction to take them in. With the first 2 albums, he was, at least, musically adventerous. Jah Wobble and Keith Levene were very innovative and knew how to play. The dub stuff had the potential to be cool. What detracted from the sound was Lydon screeching.As the band moved on, they tried too many diverse musical styles, which is why this compilation is horrible.I like rock, I like musically adventerous music. I like good musicianship. I don't like weird quasi-dance music especially mixed with screechy, purposefully annoying ,semi-rock music.Only a fanatic of this group could listen to the cd all the way through. The songs are too diverse for the casual listener."
2,"Enjoyable.....but Schizophrenic! Really, whats this movie about??","Well made & well-intentioned documentary is about 2/3rd Crosby Stills & Nash and the rest all the other artists featured on the cover. The DVD cover art tips one off that the film is an overview of the Laurel Canyon music scene of the 1970's. The DVD's Main Menu states ""Crosby, Stills & Nash IN Legends of the Canyon"" and the film's Opening Credits read ""Legends of the Canyon - Origins of West Coast Rock"". Its like the producers of this DVD cannot make up their mind what this film is really about. Film is disjointed & ends very abruptly. Very little of Joni Mitchell or Neil Young. nothing about America (although Gerry Buckley gives an opinion on other artists). What about Frank Zappa, Jackson Browne, Jimmy Webb, The Monkees, Tim Buckley, and on & on. Fans of CS&N will enjoy, other folks wishing for a better view of LC scene, stick w/Henry Diltz's companion book ""Canyon Of Dreams""."
2,"More of a tribute to Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young than Laurel Canyon Doc.","I was disappointed in this DVD. While I did appreciate hearing and seeing some of the history of The Canyon at the beginning, I feel that LEGENDS OF THE CANYON is really more of a tribute to Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young and their different band permutations than it is a documentary regarding the Laurel Canyon magic. There aren't any interviews with Carole King, Linda Ronstadt, The Eagles, and many others who were there. Joni Mitchell is given some well deserved props, but she is not interviewed either."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,Pretty dull treatment of what should be fascinating material. Watch it for the facts but don't expect to be enlightened or entertained. The narration is awful and some of the interviewees have nothing to offer than having been there.
1,Who cares. Don't waste money on this turkey!,"This DVD is not what it is billed as. Who cares about Henry Diltz and his take on the era? His photo library, his silent footage of Woodstock, his silent slide shows. MY slide shows of graduate school at UT Austin are more interesting.This was painful to watch.What most viewers care about is the music, with supplemental back story. There is essentially none of that. What little music on the DVD is poor quality in audio and video.I've seen MUCH BETTER collections from Time-Warner Info-mercials on late night TV.I will gladly give my copy to any of the reviewers who rate it over 2 stars! If you sat through this DVD, you are obviously suffering from sequelae of too much drug use in the 60s and 70s.I would not insult a friend with this DVD. So I am probably stuck with this turkey."
4,Legends of the Canyon,This was an enjoyable CD to watch. I liked the interviews and recent pictures of people such as CSN. I would have enjoyed more in depth info on Gene Clark and also the Byrds. It was mainly on CSN&Y. I'm glad I purchased this CD. It was very entertaining for me.
2,Not impressed!,"Sorry to say but I'm Not Impressed. The Dvd is all about Crosby,Stills, Nash & Young. Some is interesting (products of the other bands mentioned). But I would much rather see and hear some technique. The little they do sing Yes, is magnificent. Sure could of used more then 15-20 seconds here and there. Way to much talking... Just my opinion. Ted"
5,GREAT!,Worthwhile to sit back and enjoy Especially if you are a fan of this era and music. Opens a door to witnenss an incredible concentration of talent.
2,Wrong format,I would love to have this but the format it was sent in was for America (NTSC) instead of European format (PAL).On the order sheet there was no option for PAL which does seem very strange.If there is an option for PAL I would still like to order this.
2,Lousy color.,"I expected a nice burgandy, but got more plum purplish color. I love fiestaware, but this is not a nice color. The color varies greatly in the sample photos of Cinnabar on this website and all others that show it."
1,Inaccurate Measurements,"Item's measurements are listed as:From the Manufacturer22-Inch Power Tool Box with Lift out tray, measures 21.31-Inch by 13.5-Inch by 12.5-InchProduct Description21"" Gray/Black Plastic Power Tool Box With Lift Out Tray, Total Size 21-5/16"" Long x 12-1/2"" Wide x 12-3/4"" High.Actual measurements:Outside (at the largest ouside dimensions)L 21"", W 11.5"", H 13.5""Inside (smallest inside dimensions ..... where it counts)L 19"", W 10.5"", H 12.5"""
3,It's a box...,"I ordered this toolbox because it was the only one I could find deep enough for my application. I didn't expect vary high quality, and I got what I expected.Pros: Very deep, large box.Cons:Very flimsy. This box has very little internal support so the whole box flexes around. The hinges and lid seem very thin, and I wouldn't suspect this box to hold up to being carried around full of heavy tools."
5,THREE STAR POWER AND..SIDNEY LUMET TOO!!,"Connery,Hoffman and Broderick is not the typical cast . Would you in your wildest dreams picture Dustin Hoffman as an Italian named Vito? Not only that but Sean Connerys son? Not only that but Matthew Brodericks father? Watch and you will believe! Sidney Lumet is a brilliant director and he pulls this one off beautifully! Its wonderful fun!!!! I enjoyed it tremendously!!!"
1,Inane,"Quantum theory is one of the great developments of the 20th Century, yet this film (narrated by a child) trivializes and dilutes it without in any way making it more understandable. Produced by a woman who is apparently an artist, the film (ala Dr. Zhivago) simply provides lots of feel-good music and artistic creations ""inspired"" by quantum theory. It's just too cute for words. That the Smithsonian would lend its name to this kind of mindless pap is inexplicable."
1,Smithsonian World: The Quantum Universe,"Awful! I was looking for a video that would contribute to better scientific understanding. This is a trivial, tedius philosophical discussion. Also, I can't believe it is dated 1995. The quality of photography & the style of everyone's glasses puts it in the '70's or 80's. Stick to Stephen Hawking's Universe and Discovery/TLC's Universe 2001. Don't waste your money on this one like I did."
2,A Superficial Study,"Cross examination may be a lost art, but this booklet does little to help the reader find it. The chapters are mostly short, superficial pieces that are correct insofar as they go, but they do not go far enough. For example, the chapter on ""Tests for Credibility"" consists of a list of twelve ""tests"" covering a page and a half. Nowhere does it give any hint as to how to go about applying those tests. Ehrlich waxes most eloquent when he holds forth on the ""fallibilities"" of eyewitness testimony. It is almost as though Ehrlich hopes that someday a reader of his book will become a juror in a criminal case that Ehrlich is defending. For the best, most inexpensive practical advice on how to conduct a cross examination, read Francis Wellman's ""The Art of Cross Examination."""
4,Excellent pastiche,"Although it is set in 1901, it retains the feel of the earlier-set pastiches and stories of the Victorian Era. The story itself is highly inventive and intriguing. There are plenty of adventures to be had, especially once Holmes is accused of harassing a young woman (and eventually her kidnapping). It is classic Sherlock at his best. For its length (only 150 pages) the book is rather pricey..., but when you're pressed for a high quality read, then I would highly recommend going for it-- you won't be disappointed."
5,Mellow Back Porch Blues,"They say don't judge a book by its cover, but I just couldn't resist the photo of John Dee Holeman with a big ol' grin on his face, a cigarette hanging fom his mouth and a National Steel Guitar in his hands. From the country blues, with some wonderful acoustic guitar and lyrics that'll bring a smile to your face. Beautiful renditions of blues classics (Robert Johnson's Sweet Home Chicago) are mixed in some of John Dee's own tunes. Taj Mahal makes a guest appearance, providing backing on some of the tracks. John Dee picks you up in his arms, takes you to the South and just doesn't let go. A rare treat indeed."
4,Worth It,"Underrated doesn't begin to describe this talented bunch. Take a chance on this and their follow up album Nuttin Less, Nuttin More and you'll be pleasantly surprised. Not every track is a winner, but when they get it grooving they get it right."
1,CHARLES!,WHEN MY FRIENDS OF THE OLD SCHOOL R&B WORLD SAID A BUNCH OF IGNORANT HOODRATS SAMPLE MY MAIN GROUP THE GAP BAND HUMPIN I WAS DISGUSTED I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD WHEN THE GAP BAND CAME OUT WITH TAHT SO JUST FOR THE HELL OF IT I BOUGHT IT REAL CHEAP AT A DOLLAR TAPE AT A FLEA MARKET AFTER THAT I TOSSED IT IN THE THE TRASH THEY MESSED IT IT UP WITH ALL THAT HOLLERING BULL@#$ IM NOT INTO GANGSTA RAP I LIKE OLLLLLLDDDDD SCHOOL RAP LIKE KURTIS HE HAD A BAND!!!!!!!!!!!

WORK REAL HARD TO MAKE MUSIC TO US HAPPY AND DANCE AND ROMANCE THESE TYPES COME AND MESS IT UP WITH NEGATIVITY OLD SCHOOL ALL WAY KEEP IT FUNKY !!!!!!!!!!
2,A cheap translation for a great writer,"I had read the book about 15 years ago in Albanian translation, and just because I loved it so much back then, I wanted to read it in English translation as well. I was shocked with the awful translation of A. W. Wheen. It doesn't do justice to Remarque's greatness and it takes away so much value and purpose from the book.The book's value is FIVE great stars, but the translation makes sure the writer is not appreciated for what he has achieved."
5,Experience this!,"I read this book when I was eighteen years old, and it mesmerized me by its fatal and romantic mood and (how the reader from NY already said) purity. It's so pessimistically beautiful. After many years, it still has the same charm."
2,No title,This seller failed to do me the courtesy of notifying me that the book I ordered was not in stock. I waited almost a month before I was advised of this and this was not until I e-mailed the seller.
5,Love it!,"100% awesome, great, perfect! This was my sweet 16 present and i could not be any happier! It is now my favorite guitar, it sounds great, looks great, I totally recommend this.Since it is a great guitar i also recommend getting a hard case for it, i wouldnt want to take any chances..."
2,Creepy,Two people who should never get together.She likes yanking him around and he responds be becoming a stalker. This left me really cold
4,nice product...unreasonable shipping,I placed a large order for Christmas with Amazon. What I didn't know and found out through e-mails as the order was processing was the items were not coming directly from Amazon...they were coming from all sorts of different sellers each charging inflated shipping. I tried to cancel part of my order when I realized what was going on...following Amazon's guidelines. I contacted the seller of the certain items directly before I received notification of shipment. My e-mail was ignored by the seller and the items were shipped.I just thought others should be aware.
5,One Of The Best Stephen King Movies Ever,I purchased this for Halloween. I saw it on TV years ago. I was creeped out then & was creeped out again this year. They made the vampire in this movie Nosferatu looking which was a big plus since Nosferatu is the best vampire movie ever made. It moves quickly & quietly along with the suspense building all the way!
5,Scariest Made For TV Movie Ever!!!,"All movies are different from the book, however, that doesn't change how much good scary fun is contained in this flick. If you like the genre, get this movie, and cover your neck!!!"
2,Movie that doesn't live up to the book.,"Maybe it's because I thought Salem's Lot was the scariest book I've ever read, but I thought the movie was weak. It started off well, but the Vampire itself was poor. Also, in the book, the pace really picks up as time goes on to where you really feel urgency at the end. Here, I thought the ending was thrown together, like they ran out of time. Maybe if you haven't read the book, this would be a good movie."
2,many artifacts and grain,movie is great...the transfer to dvd is not....many white spots - in some scenes you watch the grain and artifacts more than the movie...very disappointed...wait until they redo this one...
2,Salem's Lot,This movie was a far cry from the book. It's farther away then the movie Carrie. I enjoyed reading both but this movie was not even close. And I'am not talking about horror either the drama is terrible. David Soles didn't act like Ben Mears at all. I think he only read the screenplay and not the book. Their are to many rewrites in this movie only thing in common with the book is the title.
5,lioneltrains1,"This movie is excellent, full of suspence and hair raising action David Soul was excellent in this movie!! If you are in to horror movies this one is a excellent one and worth the money."
5,Real vampires!,Actually bought this movie for my Dad who really wanted to see it again. I did see it as a kid and loved it. I won't go into the movie since that kinda spoils it and there are other really good reviews about it already here. Amazing movie if you want to see real vampires and not romantic vampires like in Twilight. -.- VHS did have a wacky beginning but rest of it played fine.
3,Salem's Lot - Movie (VHS),"I loved this book! The movie? ...It's okay. I can say I was quite happy to find the movie here on Amazon because it has been a difficult film to find, for me. READ THE BOOK!it may be KING'S best work, along with the Shining of course!"
3,VAMPIRES,"ONE OF THE NEXT TO THE BEST VAMPIRE MOVIES MADE FOR TV. ALMOST 3 HOURS OF BLOODSUCKERS. WHO DOESN'T LIKE A GOOD SCARY VAMPIRE MOVIE? THIS IS ANOTHER SATURDAY NIGHT MOVIE, WITH THE POPCORN AND FEET UP ON THE SOFA, WATCHING WITH FRIENDS."
2,Old Sucky Version,I bought this movie hoping that It would be good like the mini series. It was not so but it did follow stephen kings storyline. The ending is unrealistic and this movie is just plain boring. I had to stop and take a brake from it because i was so bored. I WON'T ever watch this version again.
5,Yet Another AWFUL Adaptation Of A Stephen King Book!!!,"This miniseries was made in 1979 and back then Stephen King and David Soul were the ""flavour of the month"" so some geek Hollywood executive decided that with these two guys you can't go wrong. Well I am sorry to say that they got it very wrong. First of all the ""small town feel"" of the book is not present in this movie and secondly major characters from the book were given secondary roles.David Soul spends most of the movie debating the existence of vampires (boring) and even the presence of Bonnie Bedilia can't save this turkey of a movie. I give it 5 stars beause it DOES have James Mason in it who is suitably creepy in his role as Straker, the vampire companion."
1,please read the book instead,this is one of the boringest movies i have ever seen.it had absolutely no scary parts at all.dont waste your time
1,This Movie Bites,"Bad acting, bad directing, bad dialogue, bad cinematography, bad sets, bad lighting, horrible music. It even has bad make-up. This is bad all the way around. Not even campy fun. It is just boring. When the vampire jumps up and they play a very loud minor chord, you know that you are supposed to be frightened... but you just aren't. You just sigh. Amazingly, they managed to write out ALL of the really horrifying and creepy moments from Steven Kings book. Try any other movie. If you want something scary, this ain't it. If you want something entertaining, this ain't it either. It is difficult to describe how bad this movie is. Steven King fans, try the Shining. This just might be the worst movie I've ever seen."
5,Always a favorite!,"For me, a great horror movie doesn't have to be all about guts and gore. I love a good scary movie that lets your imagination take over. This movie does just that."
5,AWESOME VAMPIRE MOVIE!,"I'm a huge fan of vampire movies, but when I saw SALEM'S LOT (1979), I knew I'd seen the best. I've never read the novel by Stephen King, but the film itself was excellent. There are a lot of great actors in this movie, like David Soul as the hero, Ben Mears. James Mason was really good as Straker, the Arch vampire's henchman. Reggie Nalder plays Barlow, a truly hideous vampire that takes over the small town of Salem's Lot.Don't listen to those guys who says who say the 2004 miniseries is better. I can't say I've watched it myself, but you can't beat the classics. The whole movie was scary--I even had vauge dreams about meeting Barlow. But I liked it so much I bought the DVD made by Warner Bros. The movie quality is great, but there weren't that many special features. If you are a fan of vampire films, you MUST see SALEM'S LOT (1979).""You'll enjoy Mr. Barlow, and he'll enjoy you.""--(...)"
3,Not as good as the book!,"For me, I loved the book Salem's Lots. In fact it is one of my favorite books of all time. The movie on the other hand just didn't do it for me. It is close to the book as far as the storyline, but the acting and the cheep looking vampire ...not so good.So I give this movie a 3 at best.Stephen John Becciaauthor of The Treelanders"
4,One of the scariest vampire movies,"Unlike some ""modern"" vampire movies that uses gothics an style, no-one can scare the pants off you like steven king who seldom uses these techniques.Salems lot is truly a ""SCARY-POPCORN-FLYING-SCREAMING-NIGHTMARE-HAVING-AFRAID-TO-WALK-IN-THE-DARK"" flick. You gotta see and own this great and classic horror flick.The video quality isnt the best (c'mon its over 10 years old) but its worth it. A re-mastered edition with more extras would've made it a five-star flick."
3,Pretty good...but could have been better,"The good news is that you get the full three-hour version of Stephen King's ""Salem's Lot"" here, which is a big improvement on many previous VHS releases of the mini-series.The bad news is that you don't get much else; a theatrical trailer for the European cinema release and that's about it. And that's something of a shame, because by late '70s TV standards, ""Salem's Lot"" wasn't bad at all. Yeah, it could stand being re-edited to eliminate the fades for commercials, and some commentary tracks from, say, Soul or director Tobe Hooper would certainly be welcome, as would be adding some of the original TV commercials and taking another pass at the transfer in an effort to remove some of the film's graininess. But as a late '70s made-for-TV horror flick, it's actually held up pretty well - and if you pay more than ...for this you weren't trying. Still, far from the final word on this mini-series."
5,One of the best vampire movies ever!!!,"Even though the movie is older, the vampires are way scarier than the cgi vampires of today."
3,Salem's Lot,"I saw King's Salem's Lot when it first came out after reading the novel and found it pretty exciting. However, watching it again a couple of weeks ago, I was sort of disappointed. I still think David Soul is great in the role of Ben Mears. So is James Mason as the mysterious Mr Straker. But frankly the elusive Barlow is rather comic and does not particularly strike horror in the hearts of an adult audience. Moreover many questions remain unanswered: What becomes of Susan? Why had Straker not moved the resting place of his charge? All in all, though, I think the film is entertaining and a good buy for those interested in 'vampires'."
2,Quite boring but it keeps you off the streets for awhile.,"I have to admit I didn't quite like this movie. The idea in itself is not a bad one, I haven't read the book so I can't say much about that but the movie is somewhat boring. It runs for about 3 hours when I get the idea that the plot would be better for a movie one hour shorter.I bought this movie knowing that it's director, Tobe Hooper, was the big man behind ""The texas chainsaw massacre"" which I loved. Salem's lot didn't live up to my expectations. It's plot develops real slow and it is quite predictable, the fact that it is an old movie doesn't justify that in any way. The movie desperately tries to create a chilling atmosphere yet never quite reaches it, which has nothing to do with the year the movie was made in.I can't say I found the watching of this movie a total waste of time, and it isn't expensive either. But if you like Tobe Hoopers work i'd skip this one and go straight to Poltergeist."
1,DVD scratched,"Halfway through the movie, it kept freezing up constantly. I cleaned the DVD and it did not make a difference. I want to return it and get another one. Please let me know how to do this."
5,A Treat for Vampire fans everywhere!,"This is fun and scary stuff from an equally fun and scary film maker, Tobe Hooper. The performances by David Soul, James Mason, Bonnie Bedelia, and the rest of the supporters are all first rate. This brilliantly uses music, atmosphere, and tension scenes to scare the viewer rather than graphic violence or gore. These scenes include: a corpse coming to life in front of Soul, Goeffrey Lewis' transformation, Mason and Nalder's attack of a family in their home, and the child vampire tapping on his friend's window in the middle of the night. Hooper provides plenty of action as well as scares. If fans enjoy this film, they should definitely seek out the very similar Needful Things. Caution: Seek out the longer 180 minute version of Salem's Lot, not the 112 minute cut. Well done and highly recommeded."
4,Vampires galore,"Vampires, vampires, vampires, that pretty much includes the movie. A nicely written and performed flashback style movie. Those who are intriqued with David Soul will enjoy it all the more. A few intense moments are the best it offers, if you are looking for slasher type movie you will be disapointed. Over all a good film."
5,A Classic Horror Movie,"Salem's Lot is one of my favorite horror movies of all time. I have seen it at least a dozen times. Despite being a made-for-tv movie that came out in 1979, it is quite well done. The music certainly helps to create a creepy atmosphere and the special effects stay within their limits. By that I mean that a lot is left to the imagination rather than cheesey gore or weak special effects. Scenes like the younger brother floating outside scratching the window, or the crate in the truck moving forward by itself (both scenes not in the book) still give me the creeps! If you are looking for a good story rather that a lot of gore or special effects, then you should check out this classic."
3,salems lot mini series,"Where is the widescreen , all this wait and no widescreen , we know you have it ,don't you want to share it with us? I have this on vhs , yes the miniseries version , 3hours long , it is in widescreen and looks fantastic.. the 4:3 version looks so flat! So i know for certain it exists , so why , why , why even bother to release a 4:3 version . Who owns a crt tv anymore? Well if you want a long lasting digital copy this is for you ! picture is good except the colour is a bit washy! If you want widescreen well buy the deleted vhs version (if you can find it) and an old ex studio vhs player for about $40 , that's what I did , this dvd I couldn't watch , so off to ebay you go!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this DVD based on the glowing Amazon reviews. I have to wonder if these people watched the same movie. My biggest grief with the film is that it did not attempt to follow the book. The names were about all that remained true to King's original story. The ending was completely different, Father Callahan's role was so insignificant he might as well have been cut completely. Barlow didn't have ANY lines and was a pretty insignificant character.The acting and film quality were not great but it was made in '79. Barlow's makeup was terrible also. He looks like a teenager in a Smurf mask.The film makers took all the terror, evil, and soul out of an excellent story and replaced it with shots of Ben arguing with people about vampires."
3,Salems Lot,"Clearly Stephen King didn't have anything to do with the making of this,it was Cheesy and Boring"
1,Terrible,"'Salems Lot is my favorite King book but this mini-series is terrible. I know this is an old movie, but it is as cheesy as ""The Blob"" or ""The Wolfman"" or something like that. The vampire in the movie has a blue head and never says a word. In the book, the vampire is intelligent and has conversations with people (Like Bram Stokers Dracula). The movie gets everything out of order and combines characters. It's so corny it reminds me of the old Batman show where the BAF! BOOM! and WHAM! clouds appear when they hit someone. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
4,First and still best,"Despite the despite the fact that it is 25 years old and was originally made for television, this terrific miniseries rendering of Stephen King's vampire tale remains one of the best film adaptations of the author's works. What's more, it kicks the 2004 remake's tuchas (just cause you can now say ""bulls--t"" on basic cable doesn't make for a better movie). A few scenes, such as the nocturnal visit of young Ralphie Glick, are among the creepiest ever filmed. Watch it and enjoy."
1,"Horrible book, would give it a 0 if i could","Horrible racist author(Meg Meeker)who is homophobic. Why read this book when you can just talk to your kids? Im a teenager (16)and i would rather my parents talk to me than read this horrible trash. This woman has some serious issues, ""if you give teens condoms then you dont care about them"" is just one of many things she says witch is not true. Be open with your kids provide them a safe and secure place where they feel they can talk freely. Teens have hormones, things happen, would'nt you want your kid to be protected? yes STD's are out there but so are condoms help keep ure kids safe talk to them they will listen."
1,Meeker is out of touch with reality.,"I have read Meeker's book, and find it totally devoid of factual information or a sex-positive approach. It is the same old ""just say no"" approach, which is never going to click with today's teenagers. Like Josh McDowell and Pam Stenzel, she is irresponsible in not telling the truth about sex. Forget her."
4,Great for camping,"I got this as a gift and wasn't sure I would ever use it. Turns out it is perfect for camping. More specifically, in outhouses. Outhouses don't have lights and can be very dark even during the day. This flashlight is perfect to set up on the ground so your hands are free and you don't have to worry about dropping it down the toilet. I loved it so much that I ordered a couple as gifts."
4,Bright and useful,"The flashlight is pretty bright, and I use it next to by BBQ grill when I find myself grilling at night. The tripod is simple and works as you would expect. It's a little plastic-y, but hasn't broken on me yet in my limited use."
3,Wrong dimensions,"This is a great little flashlight but it is not the one in the description. Under Product Details it says that it is 15"" tall when in fact it is only 6"" tall. I was trying to replace one that I had lost which was 15"" tall so I ordered this one. I like it but the description should be updated."
4,pretty cool,I haven't really used it but I did test it. I liked that it is compact and fit easily in my toolbox. Batteries go in the legs. Nice design.
5,thanks,"Thank you so much, this is just what i ordered! I already own 3 of these and love them so much."
5,Great Little Light,"This small flashlight easily fits in a car, on a desk, etc., where it is visable. Because it is so cute, I leave it out on my computer desk, eliminating the search in drawers, when I suddenly find myself in the dark. It is also useful in small spaces when trying to hold a flashlight while doing something else. It makes a great gift,too."
4,Works great,I find this little guy really handy to work on my computer. Just pop out the tripod and adjust the light to where you need it. Just try not to drop it. I did that with the larger one and the tripod doesn't work anymore. Other than that I haven't found a problem with it.
4,Versatile compact flashlight,"This flashlight is not quite as rugged as we had hoped for a Stanley product (the heavy-duty foobar comes to mind), but it puts out plenty of light and is a good size to keep in a vehicle."
2,No Light! But I Fixed It.,"This is a neat flash light, and will serve it's intended purpose well if it is tough enough. That said, I rated it two stars as it did not work at all out of the box. I was about to return it, but then curiosity got the better of me, and I tried to figure out why there was no light. It turned out that one of the rubber sleeves on the battery tubes was out of position and was preventing the end cap from contacting the battery tube. I repositioned the rubber sleeve with a little super glue to hold it in place and it worked fine. Gives good light and is lightweight. Not sure how long the batteries will last or if the construction is rugged enough. Time will tell..."
2,not what i expected,when i ordered this for my husband i was thinking it would be alot bigger so when i got it i was a little disappointed in it
2,"Cheap, legs won't stay together","This is a poorly made device. Feels chintzy and the tripod legs, while magnetized, won't stay together, which makes it frustrating to use as a handheld flashlight."
5,Stanley 95-111 a hit,I bought several minis as Christmas gift theym were just what was needed for the reciepients they wre all very pleased with the product . I am going to order more
5,get upppppppppppppppppppppppp,"what can you say about this album,in my mind one of the most underated bands of the eighties,sheer class full of everything you want,from full on rock to ballad,buy it and be educated,they dont make em like this any more."
5,He will never top this,"Unfortunately,the Teutonic rocker never capitalized on the pure power,production & songwriting of what is probably the premierestudio release of all his solo group outings.There's a good reason that Sirius satellite radio has this inrotation on the ""BIG ROCK"" channel and it'e really quite simple:there isn't a weak moment here.Like UFO,this lineup never broke big worldwide,due to the usual combination of poor promotion,radio and tour support and theband members (namely it's namesake) problems with substances & ego.But doesn't that sum up most metal band's careers of the early eighties?ALso see ""Assault Attack"" with Graham Bonnet(Alcatraz/Rainbow)and MAcualey Schenker Group for some of Mike's better MSG efforts.IF you like it live,then check out the double concert recordings ""Strangers in the Night"" with UFO and MSG's ""Budokan""."
4,"Spotty, but it's Schenker","In the technique-conscious 80s, Michael Schenker should have been a superstar. That he wasn't, and an army of [people] who copied him were, was a result of his surrounding himself with lesser talent. I find Gary Barden's vocals and especially his lyrics annoying, and the production lacks punch (apparently, the band was painfully aware of this). So, the songs are robbed of some of their power, but Michael's playing is extraordinary. ""But I Want More"" is a great underrated cut. It's not a perfect album, but you still need it."
2,"I like that they are universal and cheaper than buying from Sprint, but quality is lacking.","I can't complain too much based on the relatively low price for a pack of three screen protectors, but in comparison to similar products on the market these screen protectors are lacking. Yes, it is difficult to get all of the bubbles out, but the more important issue is just how easily these scratch. I would be inclined to spend the extra money on a better brand next time, because in my experience those are about as difficult to scratch as the screen itself while these scratch like the bottom side of a CD."
2,I searched for 7 in. screen protectors,"Doing an Amazon search for ""tablet screen protector 7 inch universal"" this item came up. I should have read the small print, as these are for phones, not tablets. I just lost ten bucks. On the good side they shipped amazingly fast and look good if you are not looking for a tablet protector."
1,Screen protectors,This product smudges easily and needs to be removed from the product after a short time as the screen becomes very hard to see due to smudges that cannot be removed. I took it off and found another product to take its place.
5,Fellowes 90002 Writeright Universal Screen Protectors,Fellowes 90002 Writeright Universal Screen ProtectorsGreat product - great price -prompt delivery.
2,Could be better...,"It does'nt work if you have a screen sensitive device. I used it in my HTC smartphone and the screen did not recognize any character...But I also applied it in cameras, phone handsets, etc and it is a good surface protector against dust, mechanical shocks and so on, except if you need to use a stylus..."
3,Don't buy these,"These are not good screen protectors. Yes, it will be hard to get all the bubbles out after you install it. That's not my concern though, as I don't mind a few minuscule bubbles (and they are invisible when the device is turned on anyway). However, these make your displays look pixelated and crappy. My iPod screen protector preserves the integrity of the screen projection, so I know this isn't a necessary fault. You pay a lot of money for a quality LCD screen; don't ruin its image by getting this screen protector."
3,Screen Protector not Scratch Protector,"This is a nice product, great price and easy to install. However it does not do much in the way of scratch protection. After installation the screen protector was badly scratched within a week and needed to be changed. Guess that's why it was so affordable."
1,find anouther solution,"These scratch easy, I scratched one up bad enough trying to get bubbles out with the included squeege-card that I had to replace it after just installing it.Bubbles are hard to get out but that is understandable.They have tiny scratches to begin with whats the point.Make the device harder to read, especially in well lit/sunny areas.It does peal off cleanly.I am using it on a Ipod Touch, and the touch screen does still work great though the film."
1,Virtually Useless,"I purchased a pack of WriteRight yesteday upon a sales representative's recommendation. The intended use was to protect the LCD screens of a GPS and cell phone. Unfortunately, the product was very disappointing in two respects. One, the surface was very reflective and did not reduce glare as described on the product envelope. Secondly, even with careful application, many bubbles remained under the film, which in combination with the film glare, makes the product virtually useless. Good idea, bad implementation."
3,Pengiun Mom,"""Technical Details"" paragraph says 12 sheets. ""Product Description"" paragraph says 10 sheets. Actual sheets received in package was 10 not 12. Impossible to keep bubbles to a minimum when applying. Trying to press out bubbles too hard causes new scratches. Some scratches already on sheet before applying."
5,Nice Dean,Beautiful top. Nice flattish C neck but could have been a little wider for my taste. Excellent set up out of the box. Sounds better than any LP import I have played and plays like a good lay.
5,Definitely a classic!,"I can't believe I never knew about this movie! I actually just saw it on AMC - I had no idea that this was a true story, or how the movie ended. It just grabbed me immediately, and I stuck with it until the bitter end. The scene of the father slowly getting ready to go to work right after hearing of his son's deaths, is something you would never see in today's movies. Wow, what can I say? Any movie that affects me so much that I start researching it over the web is 5 stars in my book..."
3,good background,"I saw this movie when I was a kid of course and now that I teach US History was hoping that it might work in place of the ever popular Saving Private Ryan. The movie is all about the background of the boys, how they grew up, the relationship they had as brothers, their fighting spirit and how they tried to make sure they stayed together in the military (in this case the Navy) during the war. I have to be honest, since I was looking at this film for use in my class I was hoping for more story of them on the ship but that part takes all of about 10 minutes. But as far as good old movies go - this is a delight."
5,absolutely excellent & a must see for the entire family,"I saw this movie probably 20 years ago and have been trying to obtain a copy for my own library for the past 5 or better. Never forgot the impact it had upon me. A great TRUE story of loyalty, love, conviction, selflessness and patriotism. It lends itself to giving the viewer a greater appreciation for the freedom's we enjoy everyday and all too often unfortunately take for granted."
5,THE FIGHTING SULLIVANS,GREAT WAR MOVIE THAT CHANGED THE WAY BROTHERS WOULD SERVE THEIR COUNTRY IN FUTURE WARS. WHAT A WAY FOR PARENTS TO SUFFER SUCH A LOSS.
5,A winner,"One real treasure! A movie for the whole family with family values. It will tear at your heart strings. I am grateful to a wonderful friend who urged me to watch this movie.A great classic, one that will remain in my movie collection forever!"
5,5 brothers growing up and fighting during WWII,"This is an excellent movie that you mst see! I watched it with my family and all were moved to tears. It is based on a true story and is the reason that family members cannot serve together in the armed forces. There s also a song by Caroline's Spine that is the story of these five Sullivan boys so if you like the song the next logical step is to watch the movie. It is an older film done in black and white but that in no way detracts from the film. The characters are superbly portrayed and you become connected to each one. Make sure you grab the tissues cuz this one may need a whole box but it has enough comedy and action that it can hook even the ""strongest"" man. Even he may need the tissues at the end!!"
5,The Fighting Sullivans,"The title will recall the five Sullivan brothers who fought their last battle in the Pacific. But this is a picture of family life whose home was richer in spiritual values and poorer in material things than most. There is more humor than pathos. It is a picture for the whole family. For the first part of the film, the Sullivans range from six to twelve. As they grow to manhood the youngest braves family accord and introduces his ""steady girl."" The Sunday morning of the Pearl Harbor attack finds the family taking pictures of the new baby and Monday finds the five Sullivans at the Naval recruting station. Performances are all excellent. Thomas Mitchell as the father and Selena Royal, the mother. The five young men are played by newcomers and all the supporting players provide the warmth of the film. Llloyd Bacon directed from a great screenplay by Mary McCall. All deserve high praise for wholesome entertainmnt."
5,Everyone should see this story!,"I saw this movie when I was 21 and cried myself to sleep and when I watched it now at age 69, I was surprised how much of it I remembered. A real story with real people and so heartwarming but so tragic to see what happened to the Sullivan family. From this event, I understand that after this happened, brothers may not be assigned to the same ship. I want my extended family to see this and remember how dedicated these boys were to defending our country even in time of war. I loved the movie."
5,5 Stars for 5 Brothers,"This is the story that inspired me to attempt to join the military. Couldn't though...flat footed. Anyway, back to the review. I have always loved this movie and when I saw this DVD, I had to get it. The commentaries are great and educational and the picture quality is fantastic. For those that love history and/or classic movies, buy this DVD. You will not be disappointed."
3,Not quite what I had thought,"I had thought that this was going to be a DVD from a manufacturer - instead it looked more like a home made copy. I could be wrong on that, but the quality wasn't there. This was a gift for my 77 year old mom and she is the one that said something to me about it - who thought she would notice??"
2,"17 minutes of war, 1 hour and 35 minutes of family life","I was expecting a war movie, so I was disappointed. The first 1 hour and 35 minutes were about the family (from marriage through birth of 6 kids and the kids growing-up to their 20s). The first hour was like the ""little rascals"" (it was about the kids growing up). The next 35 minutes were about the life of the kids when they were aged in their 20s. The last 17 minutes had to do with WWII (12 minutes of war footage, 5 minutes back home dealing with the death of the 5 men). I also disliked the catholic religious theme throughout the story.To see some of my favorite military/war DVDs, click on my name, then click on ""Listmania! Lists""."
2,OOPS!,"While we enjoyed the movie, it actually STOPPED at one point. We had to hit the forward button on the remote to get it going???????????????"
5,Excellent,"This movie is great. I first saw it as a kid about 15 years ago, & fell in love with it immeadiately. Even then it made me cry. Everyone should see this movie about 5 brothers who make the ultimate sacrifice. They are mentioned in Saving Private Ryan, but its' a shame that more people don't know about the Sullivan Brothers."
3,Not really a war movie,"This picture was a little disappointing, over an hour on the Sullivans childhood and 10 minutes on the wartime experience."
1,One of the worst films of all time.,"Amazing that people like this terrible, badly acted, incredibly stupid film. But you can't argue with someone who laughs at something, I guess. The four people in our house couldn't take much of this film -- I stuck with it and watched it all the way through, just to see Clint Eastwood. The dialogue and acting are so bad that you have to take a break now and then for fear of losing too many brain cells all at once. I'm glad I recorded it from TV. It's now erased, and is just a memory."
1,I don't like snakes!,The movie was OK until the scene with the rattle snake killing the otter. That was completely uncalled for and ruined it for me. I can't comment on the rest of the film because I stopped watching it after that. Shame on the producers of this film for exploiting animals in such a cruel way.
1,Watch what you pay for!,"I had out of town company at my house for over a week and they had mentioned that they had not seen Clint Eastwood's Every which Way But loose so, I decided to order it and pay for Expedited Shipping (2 day delivery) I paid for this idem and never recieve it. I however did get my shipping returned ($5.19). The company and Amazon seems to think this is satifactory. They closed my case with me never getting the product or the refund for the product. They was only refunded the shipping (Expedited Shipping of $5.19) I am very sad and unhappy since I had never had a problem with Amazon before and always raved about how great I thought they were. When they don't stand behind their customers they are not worthy of of our loyalty and praise any longer. I do hope all will be aware."
4,Classic,This is just your basic old classic movie. we enjoyed it when it first came out and had it taped on a old vcr tape and wanted it in dvd. Still enjoy it.
4,Any Which way you can,"I thought this was some of the best work that Clint Eastwood did. Than the shoot'em up and kill'em films. Clint has a notch for comedy especaly when he told clide ""To strip the car."" I'll never forget how far he through the parts of the car. It's a funny film for the whole entire family."
3,This was a succesful and enjoyable change of pace for Clint.,"Mr. Eastwood attempted a change of pace with this film and was rewarded with one of his most succesful movies. Eastwood plays Philo Bedoe, a truck driver and bareknuckle brawler that encounters bikers, corrupt cops, and plenty of beer while searching for a lost love(Sondra Locke) with his best friend Orville (Geoffrey Lewis), Orville's Girlfriend (Beverly D'Angelo) and an Orangutan. Meanwhile, Orville's mother(Ruth Gordon) is searching for a driver's license. This movie is an entertaining change of pace, with exciting fight scenes and just plain funny gags. Eastwood was able to play more comic roles after the success of this film. Not his best, but a fun, leave-your-brain-at-the-door comedy"
3,The sequel was better,"I had purchased the sequel, Any Which Way You Can, earlier, and that movie was at least as good as I remembered it. Then I bought this one, and was kind of disappointed. Yes, it was a screwball comedy, a genre Eastwood is not really suited for, but it was rambling and often illogical. The plot seemed to have been made up as they went along, and I kept wondering when it would be over. It was funny in a couple spots, but not enough to justify the owning the movie. The Blu-ray transfer was good, but hardly spectacular."
3,Every Which Way but Loose,"Isn't it funny how old movies are always so much better in our memories than when we watch them again. I was so surprised at the movie and a little horrified as I had also bought a copy for my younger grandchildren, totally forgetting the very bad language in it."
4,Every Which Way But Loose,This dates back years but has come up very well on Blu ray.Great to see Clint Eastwood in those early day with such a fun movie.Picture and Sound quality on Blu ray was excellent.Buy it and enjoy!
4,Any Which Way You Can,"I found the movie funny, I mean Clint Eastwood is in it, An Ape, It sounds pretty simple and silly, but I like the movie. And There are some good fight sequences. If your a Clint fan, or Like A silly Fun movie than this is it. Although He's not really a ""Trucker""."
4,Lots of Fun,"This is a goofy, but very entertaining, Eastwood flick.I saw it when I was a kid when it first came out and just saw it again. It is as funny as I remembered.Clint stars as Philo Beddoe, a truck driver who supplements his income fighting in bare knuckles brawls. His faithful sidekicks are his brother Orville and orangutan Clyde. Both add lots to this pictures. Ruth Gordon also gives a memorable performance as his profane and incredibly feisty mother.Philo becomes enamoured with country singer, Lynn Halsey Taylor. He is so infatuated that he pursues her across the country. During the course of the show, Beddoe has accumulated some enemies (a very inept motorcycle gang and some loose cannon cops) who are pursuing him at the same time. His interactions with both are hilarious.The language in this is pretty rough so one may not want to watch it with kids. Other than that, this is a hoot."
4,"Good, campy cheesy fun.","Not as good as the first movie but still worth the money. Only drawback is Eastwood's love intrest (the skanky Sondra Locke) who gets harder on the eyes with every viewing. By the thrid time you watch it you'll be like ""damn that woman ugly"". But the Black Widows make another appearance so all is well."
4,entertaining,"I don't expect anything more of a movie than to enjoy it and be entertained. I don't seek to psychoanalyze or offer up in-depth critique, it's only a movie. I either enjoy it or I don't. If I think too much about Sondra Locke's part in this movie, I'd drop it down to 3 stars, but far be it from me to let ""one bad apple....."". That one drawback notwithstanding, I otherwise got a kick out of this flick... Ruth Gordon & Clyde more than make up for that drawback!"
5,"the best ""bad ""movie of all time.","i hate to admit it i love this movie, as well as the sequel. that damn clyde, he gets me every time, ma, blastin away at the over the hill black widows, is priceless, to bad tammy wynette wasnt available for the lynn haulsey taylor roll. cause, sandre locke cant sing a lick, and she aint that attractive either,[what clint saw in her is beyond me]she was terrible in the gauntlet too, but better in sudden impact.she was like a bad tatoo,you cant remove, shes always their to remind you of what a bad idea it was to have her in any of your movies.she wasnt even that good in outlaw josey wales. wich is a classic movie.this movie is over the top lewd ,crude, and obnoxious. in other words perfect.exept for locke's singin ,boy is she baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad!!!!!!"
3,Blu ray,The blu-ray picture is great on this old movie of Clint Eastwood. I was a lot younger when it first came out. It still is a corny movie for Clint.
5,Any Which Way You Can,"The product & service delivery was OK, however the high cost of mailing & handling, together with the monitary exchange rate makes it not economical to for me to continue purchasing. I recently purchased several items through you for in the $50.00 range. My cost was doubled, which I think to be outragious.Thank you, Gary."
5,Great Gift for my Mom!,"I bought this along with ""Any Which Way You Can"" as Christmas gifts for my mother (after she showed me some Youtube clips of Clyde the Orangutan and mention how she loves the movies), and am very pleased. Both DVDs were reasonably priced and arrived quickly- Ordered on 12/12/12 and arrived 12/17/12. I can't wait to see the look on my mom's face when she gets them!"
4,end of an era....,"They havent and wont make movies like this anymore. The big production companies have too much at stake to gamble on flicks that do not follow the path of a stars past successes. I lived in So Cal when this was made, and it captures the comic side of that era in a unique and irreverent way. Way to go Clint, Sandra and Geoff. It drives my wife nuts seeing me pop in this dvd as often as I do. If you want a laugh and easy fun-this is one of the best of the 70s."
2,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"WATCH OUT WHAT YOU BUY. THE DVD RECEIVED WAS FROM A CLINT EASTWOOD COLLECTION. IT WAS OF VERY POOR PICTURE QUALITY. LIKE WATCHING AN OLD VHS. THE PICTURE WAS CROPPED TO WHAT NORMALLY WOULD BE A ZOOM VIEW. BEFORE YOU BUY, MAKE SURE YOU ARE GETTING A WIDE SCREEN VERSION. AS FOR THE MOVIE: IT OUTSTANDING. RUTH GORDON STEALS THE SHOW AS ""MA"" IT ISONE OF THE FUNNIEST FILMS I HAVE SEEN. THE MUSIC SCORE IS PURE COUNTRY. IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT THIS IS CLINT EASTWOODS TOP GROSSING FILM."
5,Positive Feedback,"I ordered this product and another of the same type movie, and I was pleased at the timely arrival of the items, the easy process for ordering the DVD's and the overall cost of the two items ordered."
4,"""War is war, but business is business.""","Some slow parts, but some undeniably funny parts as well, mostly in the form of the hell's angels scenes - ""The Black Widows!"". I laughed so hard I coughed.The first one was better, but this had its moments."
4,Not the greatest......,"Clint Eastwood in comedy.....works quite well.We are used to the great man in the westerns or the cop movies where he is the man on a mission.In this movie, he is Philo Beddoe who makes his money by beating people up in unsanctioned fights.How is the movie? It is a Clint Eastwood movie, so you know it is good. It isn't the level of his serious movies but it is up there, and a lot better than so many one could see."
5,Great Quality,"We have this sign on our fence and to date there has been no fading. This is important, we have several signs that have faded drastically!"
5,just amazing,"I got this on vinyl years ago and the price was great so I got it on CD(don'thave a turntable anymore).Any one familiar with the Gary Davis catalog will beinto this one!A number of the tunes are on other releases under other names,but the performances are smokin'.Great takes on theMaple Leaf Rag,Cincinnatti Flow RagWalkin' Dog Blues and a whole host of others.I guess this was the last release he did on Prestige/Bluesville label and they are all great CD's!Harlem Street SingerA Little more Faith and Say No tothe Devil are all great!"
2,Something Fishy?,I find it oddly interesting that the five star reviews of this very expensive book all sound like they were done by the same person....or it is just me?
1,Worth reading if you can afford it,"Not a five star book in my opinion unlike the friends of Mcnulty who seem to have given it so, here, who also seem to have scolded those who did not have same thoughs sadly! Besides the nepotisum of praising it higher up the scale, the book is worth reading if you can afford it, and there are some good anecdotes with some nice pictures of Errol Flynn in his prime.A must have for any Flynn fanatic.I rate this book a good three stars."
3,A good solid book on Flynn,"Thomas Mcnulty has written a good solid book on Flynn.The first in many a year. It has a few faults like any book of this nature.It is well written and a page turner it is, after the first couple of chapters which are a little slow to warm to.After that the the pages start to fly away and you get drawn into the depth of Errol Flynn and his exciting fun and surprisingly often sad adventures.I could agree with the other reviwers with the price being a little on the steep side,which is a shame for the younger or those new to Flynn, who may be put off by the price as they loose out here.Yes the pictures are the one item I am disapointed about as a few others are!However I think the book is well worth reading even if it has to be at a later date, when the price comes down, and if it does I think the book will sell even more due to it style and presenation which is a more complete bio of Flynn that has never been available before now."
5,Great SP album,"If you're new to Skinny Puppy this is a great album to buy.The best songs on Cleanse Fold And Manipulate are First Aid, Addiction, and Deep Down Trauma Hounds. First Aid is a great song with very meaningful lyrics. Addiction is actually kind of catchy (not negatively) for a Skinny Puppy song. Deep Down Trauma Hounds is an SP classic. Cleanse Fold And Manipulate will seem a bit caustic to the uninitiated, though this is to be expected with Skinny Puppy. Of their works, I would definitely recommend this album (or Last Rights) to anyone who has an open mind and likes industrial/experimental music."
1,Dull,"Musically unimaginative & overwrought. I bought this CD based on an Amazon recommendation -- If you like NIN, then you'll like Skinny Puppy. Wrong."
5,This album is fantastic...,"Skinny Puppy was one of the best industrial (yet another word now meaningless) bands, and, for it's time, set the bar for what industrial was striving for. This is the kind of music you want to listen to LOUD and blast the hell out of you NINny listening neighbors. And as stated by another reviewer, yes, they are certainly missed.PS: You may want to check out Download or a number of other cevin key projects. They all made it into my CD collection (and not in the section that just collects dust)."
5,"One of the most famous ""classic"" S.P. albums","What S.P. collection would be complete without a copy of this album? Inlcudes the song First Aid, which is about society reaction to the AIDS virus in the late 80's. Also, Addiction which is Nivek's attempt at relating the pain and suffering of heroin addiction. Shadowcast is another classic found on this album. Anger is a drawn out primal scream done in true industrial style. Don't forget the Loony Tunes samples."
3,Pretty good collection of latter-day Muddy...,"...but now that his original Blue Sky albums (the ones produced by Johnny Winter) have been re-released in remastered and expanded editions, there is really no reason to buy this compilation.It used to be the only available remastering of any of Muddy's late career work for Johnny Winter's Blue Sky label, and it blew the original LPs and CDs out of the water, but now that is no longer the case, and the three Blue Sky albums (""Hard Again"", ""I'm Ready"" and ""King Bee"") are just too good to be condensed onto one CD with a less-than-perfectly chosen track list."
5,Great CD,"This is definitely a great CD to have. I believe the songs on this were digitally remastered, so the sound quality is superior to most of the other Muddy Waters collections. What else can I say? A lot of hits, such as ""Hoochie Coochie Man"" and ""Mannish Boy"" are here. Vintage Muddy."
3,"""Love Season"" extended","""Head Over Heels"" is very similar to Alex Bugnon's previous release, ""Love Season."" The album is a bit more jazzy than the R&B-infused; ""Season,"" and it has a gospel track at its end, ""Human Epilogue."" The distinctive Bugnon style is apparent on every track.There's not as much to love here compared to the sublime ""Love Season;"" missteps include the title track and ""Dance of the Ghosts,"" both of which try too hard to be funky and fail miserably. The musical gems ""Elis,"" ""Missing You,"" and ""No Other Love"" make up for the aforementioned bad tracks. Bugnon's uncle, famed trumpeter Donald Byrd, makes an appearance on the standout track ""Winnie.""""Head Over Heels"" is probably more essential for Bugnon fans than casual listeners. If you fall into the latter category, do yourself a favor and try ""Love Season"" first."
2,Would have been great if there was accomodation information,"I have the 1987 edition of this book so the newer edition may include hut and hotel information. However, for a book where part of the title is ""From Vacation Apartments, Hotels, Mountain Inns, and Huts"" there is NO hotel information or any information on how to book a stay at a hut.Also, the hikes are limited to very small areas. Val d'Herens is not listed on any of my maps and there are no hikes listed for Verbier which is right over the mountain.If you want to model your vacation after theirs this book is nice. This book won't fit into your vacation though. I'd recommend ""100 Hut Walks in the Alps"" which lists hut information across France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria and Slovenia."
4,easy to use,"The dictionary fit easily in the outside pocket of the small backpack that I carried on a recent vacation in Mexico, so it was on the spot with the info that I needed when I needed it."
5,Great Loverboy Anthology,"SUPER HITS contains several songs not on CLASSICS. The best of these are ""Queen Of The Broken Hearts"" and ""Dangerous."" Of course it also contains their biggest hits, but skips ""Lovin' Every Minute Of It"", their highest-charting single, and ""Notorious"", the best cut off WILDSIDE. If you buy this, CLASSICS, and their self-titled debut, you'll have all the Loverboy you'll ever need."
1,Amazingly bad performance,I do not recall ever having heard so measly a performance from an orchestra and a conductor billed as professionals.
2,Disappointing,"Nothing new here. I had expected some insights, but the information contained is the same as so many other books and articles. Because I have limited storage space, I select the books I buy very carefully. I don't even know who to give this book to. It will probably end up at the next book sale the library has."
4,Excellent!,"For the first time out of the gates, Riverwatch was brilliant.The mind play in the book is what made it most chilling for me. I thought the plot was excellent. I loved the Biblical references (whether intended or not). They added a silent layer to the story that was captivating.I appreciated the characters doing the right thing despite the circumstances they were up against.I've read the negative reviews on here and challenge those who didn't like Riverwatch to do better. ;) Send me a note when you've got it done!I am not easily scared. Riverwatch had me afraid to walk to the bathroom and I did NOT want to look or go outside.I'm looking forward to Heretic!!"
3,"Good, not great - enjoyable, could have been better!","I finished this book in a couple days - loved the concept of an eternal struggle between these two ""immortal"" races, but the book could have been so much better. The best way to describe the writing is to call it simple. Each chapter was very quick and the 4 main characters had no distinct differences to make me really care for one or the other. There were some hints about the cop's background that I thought would come into play but didn't. The construction worker guy was never really developed, and he was the most likeable of all of them. And what happened to Blake? He disappeared from the entire book!!!!!I'll probably purchase Nassise's next book, but I'm hoping it's a bit ""deeper"" than this one.All in all, a cool idea that could have been much better."
5,Haunting Tale,"Joseph Nassise weaves a chilling story that rivals some of the best in the genre. With superb characterization and an intriguing plot, this book will satisfy, yet still leave you yearning for more."
1,Horror Genre Misled,"While the attempt and effort was there, this so-called horror books misses the mark.Instead of sitting at your desk at work writing this novel, perhaps you should have performed an honest day's work and done it at home. You forgot to put Mark Dorn in the book's credits."
3,Pretty Comprehensive and Easy to Use,"I bought this book hoping that I could quickly find answers to questions I had. I like that you don't have to go to your bible every time you get a reference for a topic....they have some of the verses right there in the book. However, the topic list and cross reference could be a bit more extensive. If you want to look for what the bible says about being gay, you can't look up the word ""gay"" or ""homosexual"". You have to come up with another word, of which I can never think of. This is just one example of the lack of cross referenced words.My suggestion would have been to leave out the verses in the book and add more cross referenced, common-day words."
5,Great Resource,"This is an great topical reference, I use it quite often when studying a particular topic. The book is well made and lays open while reading."
2,OK,"I did not use this text for reference material as much as I had anticipated. Personally, I had difficulty with the material under the topics being as such, I did not use what I found."
3,"Cool, but yeah right","This was a fairly good book. Each baby-sitter had her own plot, in a way. But come on, Ann, all the Super Specials are unrealistic. What group of girls has the opportunity to go on fourteen plus trips like that? I don't know too many people who, by the age of thirteen, have gone to the Bahamas, Vermont, California twice, NYC, some island paradise, Sea City, Hawaii, and a cross-country tour. Not to mention being snowbound, going to camp, being in a school play, and getting stranded on an island. Good luck for next time, Ann, you'll need it."
4,"Fun, action-packed, the works...good book","It's fun, it's action-packed, the works... I like this series, and the author never lets me down. Now that I'm living in Korea, I don't get to read much English books, But I'm gonna beg my parents to let me order some books...Have fun reading it!!!"
3,pretty good book for a hard core BSC fan,"Well I've read my share of BSC books, I have my favorite characters, my favorite episodes, and the common questions (when will they move on past the 8th grade? How come no one has green eyes?). I would consider myself a loyal fan of Ann's series. Then, and only then, do I feel obligated to express my opinion on this literature. First, I was glad that the BSC stopped in Wisconsin, even if it was just to the Brewers Stadium. Since it is my home state I have always wished they would spend some time there. Second, I will agree with some that it, and all super specials, are unrealistic, but come on, isn't the whole series if you think about it? That is why it is fiction. The BSCintheUSA was a simple read, with enough action to satisfy any reader, plus enough conflict to keep hard core BSC fans eager to read on. I guess I only gave it three stars because I am growing bored with the series--not that I think Ann should retire her pen--the BSC is a legacy."
3,unrealistic,"Overall, this book was good, but boring and unrealistic. I mean, as another reader said, not many people have the opportunities to go on half as many trips as the BSC has. Another thing: when are the BSC going to graduate out of eighth and sixth grade? This must be like, the BSC's fiftyith summer in eighth and sixth grade. Grow up, baby-sitters! And then there's one more thing: why does Stacy get so many guys? First there was Toby in book #8, then there was Pierre in Super Special #3, and of course Robert, plus a million others, and now there's Ethan! I think it's Claudia's turn to get a guy, now! Stacy comes off as sort of a boy-crazy snot who thinks she's all that, just because she's lived through a divorce and diabetes. This book wasn't the best BSC book ever."
3,I don't feel I got my money's worth!,"I was disappointed by this book. I personally prefer the earlier BSC books much better! THis was unrealistic and made me jealous. It was also BORing! It dragged on and on and I could have guessed the whole story! Also Stacey was a jerk. She got mad at Claudia over nothing! Best friends don't do that! And why does she get all the guys? Boys at that age just aren't interested in girls yet, and yeah right, I bet she'd know someone clear across the country! I can't believe her folks let her ""date"" at that age, I mean, shes just a KID, for Pete's sake! GET REAL!"
5,The Great Inspiration,I found the book to be uplifting and encouraging. LeRoy Brownlow is a spectacular author and I hope to read more of his books in the future. Read this. It will improve your soul.
5,This is a beautiful flag!,"This is a beautiful flag and very well made for the price. I am glad I ordered it and am going to order more for my friends. I received faster than expected and have no regrets.Thanks,E. Bonini"
4,ETHIOPIAN Flag,My wife loves this flag. The fact that it arrived much faster than we anticipated was a plus.Wife has it hanging in the sports room so everyone can see.
2,Really!?!,I recieved it within the time frame but its not the actual flag it looks like my little nieces drew the lion... Totally counterfeit!
3,Good money for the pictures,"As stated in the previous review, there are several inaccuracies, as in page 39 the Shenandoah is said to be the Los Angeles, or in page 41 the date of the first flight of R101 is said to be that of its last flight. These are minor mistakes, but writing in page 46 about the Macon, the author changed the number of survivors with that of the dead ones! This makes a tragedy out of what was mostly a great material loss and shows the lack of attention and/or research put into the book.Anyway this volume is worth for its pictures, some of which I have never seen before, and the LZ126 drawings on page 38. All in good quality paper with a fair price."
3,wasted money,The product is inexpensive and it works. The reason it wasted my money is because the same pieces come with the Waste King disposal unit I purchased. It is fine for replacing a brocken stopper but even the old stopper is in good condition after many years.
1,Probably not needed,There's a suggestion when you look at the Waste King disposer description that you might need this set for your new installation. Not true: these pieces come with the disposal.
2,Missing information,"Why oh WHY don't they list the actual product dimensions or the actual models of disposals that take this part? Is the circle about 3 1/8 inches in diameter? There are lots of similar items and many models of Waste King disposals that do NOT use the same splash guard. I don't want to have to return such a small item, especially since so many have reported never getting their money back for a return. And why can't I purchase just the splash guard? I don't need the extra sink stopper. Does anyone know where I can get just the splash guard?"
2,Garbage Disposal Splash Guard,The spash guard that comes with the Waste King Gabage Disposal unit protects from backplash of food items very well. However the hole for the food to go down from the sink is too small. You have to use some tool to push food through. You also can't look to see of all the food has been ground down and sent through to the disposal unit. In addition it is nearly imposible to retrieve items that have accidently gone down into the sink. I would recomment looking for another splash guard that is compatible with the disposal unit.
2,Color not as shown!,The color different than shown- mine came in black- the reason I ordered because it showed as silver. ( To match a stainless steel sink) Return cost more than item. It is not worth returning. So only thing I could do was to let others know.
3,Couldn't get installed,"The disposal was too difficult to install, even a professional couldn't get the disposal attached to the sink ring. Had to return, so I can't review the actual performance of the disposal. The return was handled smoothly, hence the 3 stars."
4,Works as advertised,"The parts fit my disposal and work as they should. Could be a bit more robust. I worry that the strainer may come loose as it ages; but, for now it stays in just fine."
2,Inexpensive but doesn't work,Economical but it doesn't stop the water from draining out of the sink. The replacement splash guard was worth the purchase price but the stopper doesn't work.
3,This product is not made by Waste King,"This splash guard and stopper set is not produced by Waste King as you would expect from the product title. Is it made by a company called Anaheim Manufacturing in California. Although these parts work with Waste King disposals, they are not identical to the originals.It's somewhat misleading to include the words ""Waste King"" in the product title. This should be corrected to make it clear these are replacement parts manufactured by a third party."
5,Works as described in my GE disposal,After a couple months of daily use I am still very happy and basically forget that it is there. It works as described in my GE disposal and to literally 10 seconds to install. It significantly cut down on noise compared to operating with no splash guard.
3,Waste King Splash Guard and Sink Stopper,"The replacement Splash Guard works well. The the 13 year-old one had lost flexibility, clogged, and needed to be trashed. Not only did new one cut the ""splashing"" but also reduced some of the noise.The Sink Stopper is utilitarian at best, doesn't seal particularly well and is better placed out of view when company come over. This would be better in a slop sink than in the kitchen. Ugly, but in the end, I got what I paid for."
3,Not exactly what I expected.,"I thought I ordered the right Waste King OEM product and the one I received is not exactly like the original. I was able to position the splash guard so it works, but it does not fit properly. It is so tight I cannot use the stopper. There is nothing wrong with this product, just be sure when you order it's the one you want."
1,Didn't need it and it IS NOT grey like in the picture,"I thought I would be getting a classier version of a disposer sink stopper that would match my stainless steel sink better. WRONG. This is the exact same black piece that comes with the disposal. What a rip off!!! Not even worth the energy to return it.I think it is really unethical and dumb for Amazon to post false pictures of an item (as of today, they show a grey, stainless steel colored item set). Total bait and switch. Amazon should fix!Now I'm considering whether or not I can trust future purchases from Amazon, just because of this very misleading picture.Not happy..."
2,Mistake,I bought this with disposer but that was a waste. Because the new disposer came with the new set of stopper. I had to pay the shipping fee separately from the disposer which cost more than the item itself. There is nothing wrong with the stopper and guard themselves but I just did not like the purchase I made. I will keep them though I may never need to use. Returning the item will be another headache.
3,Works well but doesn't last,"Just like the original one, it becomes very loose after about 16 months of use. It just won't stay in place when pushing waste through."
3,"So, so not what I expected","I was satisfied with the product. It served my purpose, although it was not exactly what I needed. That is about all I have to say."
3,Little Small for Our Disposal.,"We really needed another stopper since ours get falling into the disposal. We bought this to replace it, but it was even smaller than our old one and we had the same problem."
4,Grant does Gospel,"This is another of Grant Green's theme albums. Here the inspiration is Gospel music. If you like gospel (without the words) and jazz, you will like this. The exception is ""So What"" which really doesn't fit with the rest of the cd, but is still a great song that Grant does well."
3,Funny,It helped me understand wimmins. They are very confusing. Kathy made me laugh. I treat wimmins with respect. I still can't get a girlfriend though...
2,Poor print quality,"If I had a chance to review prior, I would not have purchased. This publisher usually has great quality print material and authors. Not here. Its a decent reference, but for the price range, the quality should be much better.It does have a comprehensive listing for EE's, but I believe its too costly."
2,A hard read,"I have read dozens of grief & loss books in the 13 months since the suddent death of my 18 year old son. This is one of my least favorite. In fact, I still haven't finished it. It is a difficult read and very heavy into theology. There is very little about the author's own experience in losing his wife and the mother of his children but much more slanted toward Biblical teachings. I'm going to slog through it but it has been one of the least helpful to me in my difficult journey."
4,The fastest way to an insane asylum,"This book drove me crazy. It is a dry sociological look at how we ""frame"" situations we are in. It is repetitive and a kind of like a verbal calculus problem that never ends. I recommend a weekly therapy session while reading this book!!!"
4,Reminiscing is Fun!,"All of the ""hits"" were gathered for this one without being repetitive with remixes, etc. These are all the original songs, and in superb quality I might add. If you were a huge fan of Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam or are a newbie, this is for you. Whenever the 80's mood hits me, this is one of the first CD's I slam in the player. Get it before it's gone. Great price. Great music.WILDFLOWER HAS SPOKEN (smile just a little :-})"
3,catchy&fun,full force don't get the love they deserve they have been very creative.lisa lisa&cult jam are a tribute to that.take me home was a jam.little jackie was done way before janet jackson started using guitars in her work.all cried out.they were catchy and fun.let the beat hit em was one of the best 90's club jams.
1,Very disappointed,I bought this for the fact it said I could made dvd type photos. I have searched every inch of this program and cannot find out how to do that. I feel I have now wasted my money on this.
3,It's allright...,"If all you want is to 'fix up' a photo and print it,this will do you just fine. If you want to add a funky frame, or simple special effects, it's good. If you really want to get artistic, you need to keep looking. It's very good at doing the basic things, but you can't really expect to get sophisticated results. It is very easy to use, and does do a great job on refining brightness, contrast, etc."
1,Heavenly Errors,"This book might be great for a first or second-grader. It contains trivial information that possibly appeals to readers whose educational ambitions are far from being realized. Instead of debunking historical misconceptions such as (1)the speed of light is instanteneous (Aristotle, Kepler), (2) a star's brightness is due to its distance alone(Newton), (3) meteors are of terrestrial origin - 'thunderstones' or materials catapulted from volcanoes, or (4)the absense of gail-force winds proves that the earth is stationary... we instead get lectured that (1) the position of a planet excerts negligible influence on a new-born child,(2)the heat radiated from the sun is not generated by something burning, (3) winds do not cause the tides, etc. Give me a break."
4,EXCELLENT BOOK,"I was very surprised to find out that Groucho could write so well. I loved reading this book, and I wish he was still alive to write another. The book had good taste and still kept all of Groucho's famous wisecracks. If you enjoyed and comedy novel, you'll enjoy this!"
5,Who calls the kettle black?,"I think all the negative points should not be the only thing that is remembered. Half of the people writing these reviews weren't probably alive when it happened and even then listen to the media about what was happening. I think we should remember the ingenious of this man. After all, he only started what he was commissioned to do. Just because he had the guts to finish what he started should not be the basis for such a slam. I hope those who like to smear the dead feel better after they finished. One day someone may be writing a biography about you!"
3,Not for High Definition Video,"I was inclined to buy this lens for the good reviews I found and the claim that it is for High Defintion. But, after testing it with my Sony HDR-XR500V I must say that it does not keep up to the image quality of the Sony camcorder. It will save you on a situation of shooting in a small room, but its image quality everywhere except the center is too low for decent high definition video. When in fully wide, only the central third of the image is acceptable. The outer thirds are lousy quality. I would not recommend it.. it is expensive for what it delivers. It is just a little bit better than another one I have, the $30 Kenko SGW05 ...Kenko SGW-05 - Converter, which I only used with a Mini DV Sony camera. So, if you want a good quality wide angle, go with your camera to the shops and try them out. Take photos and later compare qualities. Once you find something good, let us know... I have not found a decent one yet"
3,"not bad, but can be a lot better","The book is not bad, really, and it does contain useful information about reflexology, however I would describe its layout as nothing but sloppy. Many repeated pictures and explanations lead me to think the authors tried to make the book longer (thinker...) than it has to be. Realistically, you would be more likely to buy this book if it is 120 pages, than if it is only 60 pages :-).There are many mistakes (one picture shows one thing, the next one conflicts and so on...). However, the book is still useful, and I would believe what the other reviewers said.My 2c."
4,Another Hit for Clegg,This is a must have if you're a Johnny Clegg fan. Music is crisp and clean and just makes you want to get up and dance along. Great South African music.
5,Great Album-Johnny Clegg's First Album With Savuka And A Great Place To Start If You're Not Familiar With His Music,"If you're not familiar with Johnny Clegg, this is a good album to start with.Clegg is a white South African who grew up under apartheid but who, in defiance of the apartheid laws, hung out with Zulu musicians and absorbed much of the Zulu musical style. He ran afoul of the apartheid laws for leading a band comprised of both white and black musicians.Clegg's music is a unique and energetic combination of Western and South African, particularly Zulu, musical elements.This was the first Johnny Clegg album I heard. That was back in 1989 and I've been a fan of Clegg's music ever since.If you're not familiar with Johnny Clegg, this is a good album to start with. If You like this one, I'd recommend the three studio albums that followed this one: Shadow Man, Heat Dust & Dreams and Cruel, Crazy Beautiful World."
2,Not worth the money,"This book has very little information in it and leans more towards the touchy feely approach ie how are you going to deal with it, attitudes etc. Unfortunately what I wanted was more precise information on different causes of hearing loss as well as tests used to determine it (as I am going through this right now). I wanted to understand what the doctors were doing and why but this book was a waste of time."
3,A pretty good book,"I brought the book and I was quite pleased with it. It had a lot of information dealing with tactics and strategies. The combo section was very useful as well. However, this book has 1 or 2 mistakes dealing with characters moves. The pictures are clear and easy to see, but it is in black and white. Most of all, I notice some information I've found elsewhere was not mention in this book. So unless you have the internet, this book is great for your game."
4,Quality Shock Pump,This pump does a quality job in making those minute adjustments. The one down fall is how long this pump is. This pump is way too long and makes it inconvenient to use on the front suspension; it is barely short enough to fit in my pack. Other than that this pump is great.
3,Shock Pump,"I purchased this pump on August 31, 2012, to add air to my Marzocchi 44RC3 fork. The pump came with a RockShox SID adapter and not the Marzocchi adaptor. I tried swapping the adaptors but nobody could help me. I ended up having to place two separate orders for the pump and the adaptor. This meant two separate deliveries and yes two sets of shipping charges.This is a great pump but not that good for my fork because the gauge does not measure low pressures very well. My fork required 0-15psi and this pump guage does not start measuring PSI until you have at least 10PSI in your fork.I tried calling the store before I placed my order but the store was not associated with the website."
2,"Anoter DVD series of ""Bigger Questions?"" ....","First one I bought was ""Bigger Questions? The Fusion of Science and Spirit (2008)"" This DVD made the same way: it's made of interviews. No illustrations or graphic. If you make a move put some motion pictures God for sake! It's like an audio book. And again no proof presented to their philosophy. There was only one unproved fact I found interesting that patients who received the donor's organs had latent memories of those deceased donors. But again there were no cross interviews with such as patients. So whole movie is like blah-blah-blah... I can talk like this myself especially with lullaby background music to lull your vigilance. The title of DVD says ""... from "" The Secret"" and ""What The Bleep Do We Know ?"""" - But ""Bigger Questions?..."" is not even close to these movies. ""Bigger Questions?..."" series like collections of words swinging left right and back from course of main idea.I would not recommend it."
4,soul at its best....,"All of the Isleys early work without the younger Isleys is just as good with them. But these early workouts are more raw-stripped down and pop-oriented. Ron Isley has a way of making country, and rock remakes sound like they were never before recorded. Not too many black artists can do that. To get a taste of the ""Real Isleys"" before the ""Mr. Biggs"" persona, get this with ""Get into something"", and ""Givin' it back"""
5,VERY SOULFUL,THE ISLEY BROTHERS Have Been SO Great&Influential for SO Many Years.this Disc Reflects that&more.The VOcals are very strong&SOulful.POP That THING Alone is A Jam.A Timeless Album.
5,Welcome ideas for Peace,"How interesting that many of the concepts introduced resonate with the teachings or messages from most genuine ET sources. If you have even a spark of genuine spiritual awareness this book should be very helpful in expounding many obscure concepts whichorthodox community pretends does not exist. Of course this presupposes an open-mindand a willingness to explore new ideas without being bitterly negative and hostile as many people unfortunately are, which closes the door to knowledge and Wisdom. Praise to Barbara and all her kind!"
4,"good, wierd, but makes since","a new way to veiw the world, i love to expand the horizon of possibilities, so if you do too, its a good read."
2,"""Give me a break""","This book is by far the most self-serving example of literature I have ever come in contact with. Are we really to believe that Pleiadian beings used the author to write this book, and that they somehow are these benevolent creatures out to help us - to save us from ourselves? Where is skepticism in all of this, where is rationale? Are we naive enough to simply take all of this in without question? Come on now."
1,Not a good book,"The author claims to be channeling messages from the Pleiades. And is you read ""their"" message carefully it is telling you; don't do this, do that and so on. It is like a camouflaged dictatorship message. If the pleiadians exist, I bet their not good."
4,read at your own pace for effectiveness,"I almost threw this book out. Why? For one reason only --- I found the part about the uses and applications of women's menstrual flow in Galvanization of the Goddess hard to relate with. BUT I KEPT THIS BOOK because the other parts about feminine power made sense to me. I also kept this book because it has the most wonderful, positive, constructive visualization meditations at the end of each chapter.The most important reason i kept it.: during meditation after one of the chapters, I experienced one of the most ecstatic states of awareness I have ever had. Then a few days later,(and this will sound weird to skeptics and to my own life-long friends) i experienced a surprising personal revelation from my own Guides.although, I have been finding this hard to admit: I kept this because it was Life transforming!"
4,Earth: Pleiadian Keys to the Living Library,"This is the second book in a series of 3 by the author. Excellent, but somewhat more difficult to understand than the first. Recommend reading her first book: Bringers of the Dawn. The Pleidians are several groups of ""ET's"" from the Pleiadian Star system, known by some as the 7 Sisters. Actually out sun is the 8th sister."
4,A life changing book,"This book is empowering. IT will bring more love and joy into your life. My wife and I have both enjoyed it, and it has strengthened our relationship immensely. I do wish a future book gives more insight into revitalizing a relationship as opposed to just ""moving on"" and blowing off many years of marriage. It is usually easier to move on, than to rebuild. The aspects of sexual union are essential and will help transform your life I highly recommend this and Bringers of the Dawn as well."
1,earth:pleiadian keys to the living library,"PLEASE NOTE THAT I HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED THIS BOOK. TODAY IS OCT.21, 2010. THEREFORE I CANNOT REVIEW IT. PLEASE SEND ME A REPLY AS TO WHY I HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED IT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANTICIPATED COOPERATION."
1,Path to deception,Be aware that you are not being enlightened but decieved. The Great deciever is behind this and is spreading the lie. Whatever she is channeling is not telling the truth. There are no other life forms but the deception is very compelling.
4,"Early Sci-Fi, Way Ahead of Its Time","I had never heard of Homer Eon Flint until I read a collection of stories by Edmond Hamilton (a leading SF writer of the 1930s). Hamilton, in his afterword, said that he was first inspired to write science fiction by the stories Flint had written for the Munsey pulps in 1918-19.This Kindle book is a 'fix-up' of two of those novelettes Flint wrote in 1918-19, about four American scientists who explore Mercury and Venus. The science is, of course, extremely outdated, but Flint at least tried to make his stories plausible according to what was known at the time. (Some of his ideas-- such as a temperate band between the light and dark sides of Mercury-- became staples of magazine science fiction for decades.) More importantly, Flint was a good storyteller; despite its age, this book is quite readable, even today. If you are a fan of Gernsback-era SF, you will enjoy this (even though it was written eight years before Gernsback founded Amazing Stories)."
3,Bad Video Transfer,"I can't say enough about Redd's stand up. It is very funny and filthy. His speech on censorship is quite amusing, and others are downright hysterical.Redd Foxx is terrific. Unfortunately, the video transfer on this DVD isn't. It looks like someone used home equipment to dump it on to DVD from an old VHS copy. There are lines across the screen, flashes to black and white, etc. If a decent remaster of this video ever comes out I'll easily give this five stars. But till then, I recommend buying one of Redd Foxx's CDs to hear his comedy."
4,Foxx is Still Funny,"Even though he passed away years ago, Redd Foxx is still lively and ferocious with the one-liners and deadpan humor. This is the Foxx who entertained audiences on Vaudville stages, and the same man who did great comedy albums. Don't expect Fred Sanford up on that stage."
4,Scholarly and well researched,"The authors obviously put a great deal of research and thought into this book. They interviewed agents, editors, and authors. (Nearly twenty pages at the end list the people they contacted and books they cited.) I think this would be useful to students and reviewers looking for a scholarly treatise. It might not be right for readers who just want an overview of modern crime novel heroines but I'm sure it would be a good resource for those with a deeper or more academic interest in the subject."
4,A Very Good Paranormal,"I have only read a handful of romances involving ghosts and have mostly found them lacking in any sort of believablity. Lisa Cach has written a story you can actually buy into. The characters exhibit emotions and actions based in reality I thought, now the ending...well this is fiction. Serena evolves nicely as a character and I felt you get to know her. I liked the way Ms. Cach developed Alex. I didn't feel she gets the reader as involved in his character, but I also think some romance authors give the male characters too many female thoughts, feelings, and actions. I thought Alex handled this whole thing ""like a man"" might, he's pretty arrogant, doesn't understand women, and prefers to hang around men. I do recommend this book, felt it was well written, and I think anyone can enjoy the story line and humor."
4,I never read a ghost story from this point of view,"Unusual.You actually get to tail along with Serena, the ghost, as she tries wholeheartedly to get rid of everyone in her castle. It's men she despises, and her attempts of scaring them away are quite humorous. Alex, who fell in love with the castle as a child, isn't budging. He's already had a run in with Serena many years ago when he was a boy. Now he's returned as a man and wants some peace and quite to study the stars. Serena's decided to give Alex anything but. Lisa Cach is a talented young writer and I couldn't wait to see how she planned on ending this book. I wasn't to crazy about the ending( yes! it was happy! aren't they all?)but I really can't see the book ending any other way."
4,nice medical mystery,"It is a two parter. What is going on in the morgue? Someone has something to hide, and two deaths will lead Dr. James Saracen to a cover-up that could cause the loss of a town and everyone in it.After solving this mystery, Saracen still has to find the origin of the plague and the cure.This was a light and fun read."
4,The method guide of choice for the process challenged,"This book handles alot of subjects that are very broad and diverse. It is not by far an all incompassing theory reference but if you need some really good standardized methods to improve the way you process material and improve Q&R, it definitely fits that bill. This book would be excellent for the ME manager type or perhaps the production manager with problems."
1,refund requested,"When did talent no longer become a requirement for a cd to be available for sale on amazon.com. I was thinking of taking a camping trip to santa fe but if this cd represents the boring ""chill vibe"" of santa fe thank you for saving me from the most dreadful vacation I've ever had. My friend wrote the main music for several of the shows you mentioned so perhaps you wrote some of the background scene music he thought along with a few others."
2,The movie version of the Third Crusade,"This is essentially not history; it is a melodrama based, more or less loosely, on the Third Crusade. Its Saladin and Richard are the characters a novelist would have them be -- tailored to fit his plot line, thinking the thoughts he wants them to think, driven by the desires and emotions he wants them to have. Any relationship between these shallow, crudely-drawn characters and the real thing is not only accidental but unimportant. The point of the book is to teach the reader that there were good guys and bad guys and that we (the West) were the bad guys, while throwing in sex and violence in the bargain. And so it presents a simplified, technicolor version that leaves out the historical doubts, factual uncertainties, and other shades of grey that make for good history but bad B movies.Who were the good guys and who the bad? Read Runciman's books (his Volume 3 covers the Third Crusade) -- they present history and let you decide for yourself."
5,Facinating Account of the Third Crusade,"I think this is a wonderful account of the Third Crusade. It provides an exciting and enlightening account of the two major parties involved, Richard the Lion Heart and Saladdin. I found the author's account very factual and empathetic. Richard the Lion Heart and Saladdin became three dimenisional and the author included comtemporary sources in an interesting way. One one hand they are the only accounts we actually have of the crusades but he also explains the uses of legend and myth in all accounts. There was no idea of plagarisim in the 12th century and truth was often embellished for meaning and effect. The book helps one understand how the crusade has affected history and contemporary culture. The battles over the holy lands continue to this day. I highly recommend this book and enjoyed it very much."
2,It could have been much better,"Whilst factually sound and historically accurate (for the most of it), the author is biased against both the European Crusaders and Richard. This is not good history. This is not even a good novel. This is simply dull and dry one-sided drivel. Want another self-effacing book as the West continually buries itself deeper in the ground? Buy this. Want real History? Buy better books, such as Lionhearts or Chronicles of the Crusades. This book is a waste of time. It only gets 2 stars for its accuracy, in some areas."
1,Short on Facts,"Warriors of God is written in the easy-to-read style of a novel, which makes the non-history student like me excited to read history. But this isn't history. It is mostly the author's attempt to create a visceral backlash against the European crusaders and glorify the muslim world of that age. He fails to put these few centuries in the greater historical context, which I consider a disservice to the student of history. I see no heroes in the crusades, and certainly no Christians. If you really want to know what Christianity is, try Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis."
3,The Forward Got me All Excited,"Mr. Reston's forward got me into this book. He drew several parallels between the Third Crusade and current times. I was expecting great things to come. The rest of the book, however, was just an adequate history. If the quotes from bards, chroniclers and poets were removed, it would probably be 100 pages shorter. Obviously well-researched, I found the historical part of the book to be rather thin. Overall though, I found it worth reading. The period is one colored in myth and legend. The book cut through the fictionalized accounts. Mr. Reston's honest assessment of the strengths andd weaknesses of his two heros - Richard and Saladin were interesting and worthwhile."
4,Utterly fascinating,Terrific reading and a must-read to get a handle on current Mid-East conflicts and feelings.Full of interesting facts but presented in a very entertaining way.
2,TERRIBLY BORING,This book should be a high school textbook it is so boring. It is a shame that with such an intersting tpic they can murder it so much. They bog you down with names and dates and places and it has no flow or rhythm whatsoever. Save yourself the mind wandering and find another book.
2,Fact or Fiction?,"This is an interesting story, one which provides a tremendous opportunity for study. I was immediately caught off guard, however, by the lack of substantiation and obvious fabrication of material for the sake of story movement. Footnotes are not provided and Reston utilizes dialog as if writing a novel.If your expectation is to study an historical thesis, you will be sorely disappointed. This book should be viewed as historical fiction. I did give a second star because, as fiction, the book reads fairly well."
4,Holy wars or not?,"I had always heard about the Crusades in school and at church. When I did a detailed study of the events of the wars I was fascinated by how much detail the historians included in their accounts of the war. This is due to the fact that literacy was seen as the pivotal aspect of European culture and most literacy focused on religion either Greek and Roman religion or Christianity. King Richard, king Dick, king Rich was the first real English knight in British history along with the fabled King Arthur."
5,Exciting history with a hint of Python,"This is a very entertaining piece of popular history. As usual for such work, it may be of less interest to the serious and well-informed student of history, but I would recommend it anyway just for the fun it will give you. The author manages to make the events exciting and draw the reader in, but not without the occasional hint of farce. At the same time, by keeping you reading the book brings across just how differently thought was structured in the Middle Ages. Richard's Crusade was ultimately futile and a waste both of life and of an opportunity to rule, including massacres of civilians and prisoners that would be proscribed today, although there was great chivalry between the key players. Saladin comes off better, and it is worth reading more to get a better feel for the man's flaws, but the Crusaders' acts and nature cannot really be whitewashed.A fascinating and occasionally hilarious snapshot of a very different time."
5,Great History,"Exellent!Great history of the two parties, Explained some less than glorifiable deeds of both Leaders, particularily Richard the Lionheart. More interesting is the Valor of the leaders however, Saladin was Briliantly portraid as a great Tactition. It also talked more on Richard the Lionhearts Homosexuality, didnt find that much on any other books I had read. I found it great because it had lots of good information and wasn't biased to any side. Great read, GET THIS BOOK!"
2,not a history not fictiom not a great book,"I would not particularly recommend this book. It is billed as a history but it is not. Yes it is probably factually correct, but its presentation is shall we say weird. I think the author thinks he can write history with the flair and style of Churchill, something at which he fails. There are no footnotes or backing for statements that need it and certainly some of his opinion comes across as nothing more than that. For example I do not know if Richard the Linohearted of England and Philip of France were homosexual lovers but the presentation of this affair is not contextual and makes little sense. There is less context for their sudden rivalry. Finally, while Mr. Reston tries, he does not give particularly adequate background on the happenings in Europe."
4,Almost perfect,"Except for the ill-advised portions covering Richard's fictious homosexual romance, this is a wonderful book. It beautifully shows the complexities of the struggle in which the King and the Sultan were engaged, as well as the age in general. The overall effect the book projects is to show that while piety and penitence may have brought the ""pilgrims"" to this distant land, the promises of gold, gore, and glory were what kept them there for the duration. The possible exception would seem to be Philip Augustus, who always seemed to have one eye on his kingdom at home. Add to this the various side characters, such as the treacherous Reginald of Chatillion, the maniacal Old Man of the Mountain Sinan, or the oppurtunistic ""King of Jerusalem"" Guy of Lusignan, and you have a richly descriptive chronicle of the period. Just disregard the unfounded ""manly romance"", soak in the rest, and you will not be disappointed."
2,When the facts become questionable.,"I got a hold of this book to do some research for a story on Robin Hood that I am going to be writing to get some background information on the Third Crusades and on Richard himself. I thought this book was good until I got to the paragraph that concerned Robin Hood. If you've done your homework about Robin Hood, you would know that Robin Hood was described as a yeoman, not a disposed nobleman, and if you do your homework, most researchers on Robin Hood like to point out that the king mentioned in the Robin Hood tales is ""our comely King Edward"" with no defining number. That alone put the rest of the information in the book in question, if you ask me. There are some other things about the book I found questionable, but I will leave my review at that."
4,Warriors of God,"While this is a historical analysis of activity surrounding the Third Crusade, it is very relevant to today. All readers will readily relate to the ""War"" in Iraq and other militant happenings in the Middle East. If political leaders become more sensitive to these historical events and their causes, we could achieve peace now.James Reston presents so much in a very easily read tome. His style is for anyone from those of us with casual interest to scholars of the period."
2,It was a boring book with to much detail that just draged on,It was a boring book from the start. the only good part about it was the second half which was only about 5 chapters. the other 19 or so chapters had to much detail with boring unneccesary detail and facts which nobody in the right sense would care about.
1,Watch out for Shorts and Electric Shocks,"I bought this and used it for a few months and then it started shorting and sending electric shocks through the headphones to my ears...like a lobotomy by discman? Electric shocks to the ears hurt A LOT.DON'T BUY THIS!I bought a similar Sony model, sucked in again by the small size, and had the same problem.So although it's little, don't get this.Their customer service is unbelievably bad, too."
4,great workout,I always get the most out of Denise Austion workout videos. I have been working out to her videos for 20 years now and I am always satisfied. The video is easy to follow and when I get done I feel like I have done a great workout
2,Not the best work out,I dont reccommend this tape. The work out is not difficult and doesnt feel like it does much - wish I didnt buy it
4,Fun book for young children and their parents,"This book won the Caldecott Medal in 1948. It is based on a poem the author wrote which came to him as he was walking a street in New York City, on a snowy winter night. The book takes place in the suburbs in 1948. It focuses on the anticipation of the snowfall, the actual snowfall, the children playing and loving the snow and then the beginning of spring. In this age of FEdEX and high technology, it is fun to see a postman and policeman walking their route. The story really seems like a fairy tale. It is absolutely charming. It has endured since 1948. Your children will enjoy it, and so will you."
3,Unrealistically complex,"Yes, life is complex but above space vessels, which must be created under controlled experiences, you would expect few surprises unless they developed on board. While the changes Zoheret and other teens who were born on ship are realistic several other surprises seemed a bit far fetched for me and frankly unnecessary. I won't name them obviously because that will ruin specific plot elements. While I do expect complexity from a Sargent plot this went beyond what I thought was logical and probable."
3,Nice story,Nice story using a lot of imagination to fill in the blanks of the Biblical story of creation.
4,Nice Collection,"I was specifically looking for ""Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer"" and ""Ramblin' Rose"" and was happy that this had both. The other songs play nicely, too. A good album."
2,Novak can do much better,"I've now read and enjoyed several books by Brenda Novak. She has terrific potential in both the romance and suspense genres. But in Big Girls Don't Cry, she failed to tap the potential.Great story idea...unfortunately, the dishonest, bigamist Keith NEVER got his come-uppance...instead, he got a low-stress job, access to all of his children AND still managed to exert control over both of his ""wives"" (to one extent or another) through most of the story.I felt pitifully sad for Elizabeth throughout the book. She was portrayed as ALWAYS being second choice-to both her ""husband"" and her own brother! I didn't realize while reading this that there's another book focusing on Elizabeth. In fact, the ease with which (beautiful sweet perfect wonderful) Reenie found happiness-with no concern for Elizabeth-really annoyed me. I found it difficult to be happy for her. Maybe I'll feel better if I read Elizabeth's story."
5,Two wives-one husband,"Reenie and Elizabeth O'Connal think that they have good lives. Reenie lives in Idaho with her three daughters and Elizabeth lives in California with her son and daughter. The only problem is that while they do not know it they are married to the same man-Keith O'Connal.Then one day Liz's brother Issac sees Keith going onto a flight to Boise when he had told Elizabeth he was in Phoenix. Issac then discovers the double life that Keith had been hiding.Both Reenie and Elizabeth are devistated. Elizabeth decides to move to Dundee, Idaho with her brother and children in tow looking for some closer. While Reenie does not want to like Issac there is an unmistakeable chemistry that pulls the two of them together.What happens between Reenie and Issac as well as Reenie and Elizabeth and their kids? Read Big Girls Don't Cry."
2,POOR PRODUCT DESIGN,"THE CLOSURE FOR THE EARINGS WAS NOT SECURE, AS A RESULT, EVERYTIME ANYTHING BRUSHED AGAINST YOUR EAR THE CLOSURE CAME UNDONE AND, WITHIN TWO WEEKS, I LOST ONE EARING.THIS TYPE OF CLOSURE IS NOT PRACTICLE FOR ANYONE WHO IS REMOTELY ACTIVE."
4,Gold Endless Hoop Earrings,"The order arrived on time; packaged very nicely. They are quality earrings which was one of my concerns buying on-line, and not able to handle them. The price was fair. I would recommend and would myself purchase again."
2,14Kgold large hoop earrings,"I purchased these as a gift for my mother. She saw them on Amazon andasked that I buy them for her. She ended up returning them because thepost did not seem secure. It did not extend deep enough into the hollowhoop end, and seemed as though the earring would fall out of the ear prettyeasily."
2,Good fit but not very soft...daughter does not like,"These fit a crib/toddler mattress well, and the top sheet has a fitted bottom to go around the mattress at the foot of the bed. They are good quality material as far as thickness, and the color's nice, too. However, they are not a very soft material (even after washing with softener), and my daughter ALWAYS asks for one of her other, softer sheets!"
3,Reasonable purchase,"These have been good sheets overall--they have held up over many washings, and I love that the fitted sheet is actually like a mattress sheet at one end, helping the sheets to stay on the bed and not get ripped off in the middle of the night. We have been happy with them--and in general, in comparison to other toddler sheets we have, I wish I had bought more of these, rathter than experimenting with other sets.The drawback is, given the amount of the material, the not overly-amazing quality of the material, and limited selection of patterns, I think they are overpriced (unless you get a deal)."
3,Dots fade :(,"I ordered this sheet set for my daughter and was disappointed that the dots fade after washing. I gave it 3 stars anyway, because it still looks cute even though the dots have faded and the fabric itself has held up to multiple washings."
4,"cute, not as soft as I thought","I love the pattern and lavender color, but they say they are the same material as some sheets I got from pottery barn however these have a stiff feeling to them and are not as soft as the ones I got from pottery barn."
3,Scratchy sheets,"The sheets are a little scratchy. Besides that they are a pretty good sheet set. The top sheet that is bound on one end stays on nicely. The fitted sheet fits your standard crib bed correctly. The pillow case fits a standard pillow. Hopefully with a few more washes the sheets will soften up a bit, but they haven't seem to bother my two year old."
4,Great!,"I think the Outward Hound Foul Weather Gear Coat is great. It's much easier to put on/take off than other brands and models. My dogs don't like to spend lots of time outside in pouring rain, raincoat or no raincoat, so we haven't had a problem getting soaked while wearing the coat. In light rain, though, I have not had any problems with the coat and in fact, after trying lots of different types on my Westies, bought three of them. The hood is pretty useless on a Terrier head, but it is detachable."
4,Another exciting adventure for Young Bond,"Once again, Charlie Higson has written an action packed adventure that will have tween readers talking! We purchased this one after reading Silverfin and it did not disappoint. The action is a little more intense in the sequel and young James attracts some female attention this time. (C'mon, moms - you knew it had to happen sooner or later!) Even so, it was still within reason for my 10 year old and his friends. We are looking forward to many more installments in the Young James Bond series."
4,Entertaining,"Very fast moving book and a good story. I am reading it aloud to my 9 year old and he seems as interested in this as he was in the first book, Silverfin."
1,not as it seems,"These shorts were awful! I got them for my 21 year old dauther who goes to Juilliard. She is of normal height and stature (5'5"" size 5). They came down to her knees and looked terrible. Worse than that they will not let me return this useless item."
5,A Godfather of modern blues,Scrapper Blackwell is a great original Blues stylist. His playing and singing influences can be heard on generations of musicians. Listen to this if you wish to get closer to the well.
2,Difficult to understand,"I bought this CD to hear the words to one song. It was very difficult to understand. Music isn't bad, but not my cup of tea. And I didn't find out where the Monon crosses the Yellow Dog either."
3,IT'S OK!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Glad to have it, first solo after wings, not as good as Mccartney and a little hard to enjoy. bonus track are ok. good for a true Mccartney fan."
4,Surprisingly good:),"I've been holding myself back from buying this particular McCartney album due to bad reviews. But since I wanted to complete my collection (this is the only missing then), I ordered it from Amazon and got it a few days later with the least expectation of a good listening (nothing worse than the 'Press To Play' torture). BUT, the first 2 tracks alone is worth this CD. 'Coming Up' is alright, but the highlight must be the infectious 'Temporary Secretary'. It's so experimental, yet catchy in an 'irritating' way....but it is one of mccartney's hidden gem. The rest of the tracks is worth further listening as well. It may sound silly at times, but it's quite an enjoyable album."
4,Don't always listen to what others say...,"Technically Paul's third solo album, it has had it's share of knocks. It has your typical hit single, in this case the funky ""Coming Up,"" but not much else to back it up. This is similar to the original McCartney LP, only more song-based, but Paul still plays all the instruments. It has its standout ballads ""Waterfalls,"" and ""One Of These Days,"" along with other surprises like the blusey ""On The Way,"" the gimmicky ""Temporary Secratery,"" and the suitabley titled instrumental ""Frozen Jap."" But the album has its boring points too, like ""Bogey Music,"" but is enjoyable altogether. The bonus tracks are interesting, the B-side to ""Waterfalls"" consists mainly of the line ""check my machine,"" but it contains the lengthy experimental ""Secret Friend."" The disc closes with the Top Five Wings hit ""Goodnight Tonight."" Altogether a good album in my mind..."
2,Mccratney II,"The less said the better. Two or three barely passable tunes and the rest should be buried and forgotten. Interesting only for collectors to complete their McCartney collections, but the dismayed look on Paulie's face on the cover will mirror yours when you listen to this stuff. The look says it all: ""What was I thinking recording this stuff ? I'm the guy who wrote Sgt Pepper for cryin' out loud..."""
1,My Least Favorite McCartney Effort,"I like the infectious ""Coming Up"", and ""Goodnight Tonight"" is alright, but in between that is a whole lot of filler, not of it memorable. ""Temporary Secretary"" is a song that's like listening to nails on a chalk board.""Waterfalls"" is not a bad song, but it just doesn't sound so good in this version.McCartney got his act together after this album with the good ""Pipes of Peace"", the even better ""Tug of War"", and the under-rated ""Press to Play"". I'd say skip this first effort of the 80's, which is a hollow experiment in sound."
2,Read,"Two stars because it's Paul McCartney, but this album is just so bad. It really doesn't deserve one star. It's so bad it's laughable. I want to like it, but I just can't. I may not buy all the re-issues. Although the package is very nice."
2,"A new decade for Mac, a new way to disappoint","There's not a lot to say about McCartney's first foray into the 80s other than ""whoops."" Paul tried for a DIY ethic like his solo entry into the 70s, but no amount of synthesizers or discotheque appeal can mask the weakness of most of the material. If he was going for Bowie-esque reinvention/trend-setting, he failed far worse than Bowie did during the same decade.Actually starts out pretty well with the funky stomp of ""Coming Up,"" the amusing ""Temporary Secretary,"" and the fun but empty blues ballad, ""On the Way,"" but the rest is about as spotty as it gets. If Paul wanted to try a new wave flavor, why not go all the way? Instead, he forces boring and schmaltzy ballads like ""Waterfalls"" and ""One of These Days"" upon us, and we're forced to cringe and wonder just what the hell happened. Nobody expected consistency from Paul, but dreck? You've fallen a long way, Mac.Best cuts: ""On the Way,"" ""Coming Up,"" ""Nobody Knows,"" ""Temporary Secretary,"" ""Bogey Music"""
1,Not Good For My Taste,"I have been a huge McCartney/Beatles fan for years. For my own personal taste, the albums style and arrangements are not for me. Paul admits making this album for his own enjoyment but was persuaded to release it by friends. You, however, may like this direction Paul took in 1980."
3,"On his own again, Paul gets experimental, with mixed results","First off, I'm only 24, which means I was 5 at the time this album was released. So I don't have any memories to affect my rating. Nevertheless, I can imagine that Paul is drifting from Wings and wants to see what he can create on his own. The results aren't too bad.Coming Up is of course a classic pop tune. I also enjoyed Bogey Music, Nobody Knows, and the simplicity of One of These Days. Temporary Secretary is ok, depending on my mood it either makes me laugh or annoys me. Waterfalls is also a nice ballad, but probably goes on a little too long. As for the rest of the songs, they don't do much for me.Overall, a good album, not a favorite but definitely not the worst. By the way, why is Goodnight Tonight a bonus track here, it seems like it would fit better on Back to the Egg..."
4,An Underrated (and Overlooked) McCartney Gem,"Sir Paul's post-Beatle career has been frustratingly uneven, yet the hidden gems still emerge. Macca finally clips his Wings and returns to the do-it-yourself approach that served him well on his first solo recording. Released in 1980, ""McCartney II"" is a more polished production than the 1970 effort - highlighted by the hit single ""Coming Up,"" a memorable rocker titled ""Nobody Knows,"" the ballad ""One of These Days"" and a surprising amount of experimentation. There are relatively few misfires (such as the irritating ""Temporary Secretary"") while the instrumentals hold up quite well. ""Check My Machine"" and ""Secret Friend"" - the B-side bonus tracks - display an atmospheric, improvisational quality rarely heard in McCartney's work. The overall album surpasses the mediocrity that plagued McCartney during the 1980s."
3,Not McCartney's Best,"1980's McCartney II was recorded afer McCartney disbanded Wings following his dust-up with Japanese law enforcement. McCartney played all the instruments and pretty much recorded it himself. It has a few nice ballads (Waterfalls, Summer's Day Song and One Of These Days) but it is for the most part forgettable."
3,One Of These Days,"Hardly a great LP, MCCARTNEY II is still a lot more interesting than some of the more commercial and sterile studio work he put out in the 1980s and 90s.I've never been able to get past the sped-up vocals on ""Coming Up,"" but I like the thumping pseudo-billy of ""Nobody Knows,"" and ""Bogey Music."" The instrumentals, especially ""Frozen Jap,"" are captivating, and ""One Of These Days"" is a very un-McCartneyish ballad."
2,When the novelty wears off...,"What a strange, eccentric album this is. One gets the feeling that Paul was laying low, and after the half baked mess of his previous album (""Back To The Egg""), who could blame him. This album is similar to ""McCartney"" in that it's low fi, off the cuff, but is less ""real"" than that, his first solo album. Once again, one wonders who, if anyone, is home. Any resemblance to the man who wrote all those great Beatles tunes is purely coincidental. ""Coming Up"" is the one transcendant moment where it all comes together...and as such, the album peaks on it's opening cut. The only other ""highlights"" are ""Nobody Knows"" (a wacky rockabilly-type tune that is a lot of fun), ""One Of These Days"" ( a depressing little acoustic demo), and ""Waterfalls"", the only ""real"" song in the bunch...and a lovely one at that. Re-record this one, Paul, with a string quartet. Forget the rest."
5,McCartney II (Archive Collection),"It's Paul McCartney, need I say more! It's wonderful, full out McCartney. Great to listen and get down to. Long live Paul!!!!!!!"
5,"GREAT CD , ROCK ,BLUES ,PRAISED BY JOHN LENNON !","A SUPERB FOLLOW-UP TO THE FIRST SOLO ALBUM ,TITLE McCARTNEY , PAUL DOES A FINE BLUES NUMBER TITLED ON THE WAY , COMING UP WAS PRAISED BY FORMER BEATLE JOHN LENNON(WHICH WAS A VERY RARE OCCURENCE!) ,DARKROOM PSUEDO-PSYCHADELIA ROCKER , 1 OF 2 SONGS REFERRING TO PAUL'S IMPRISONMENT IN JAPAN FOR MARIJUANA POSSESION (THE OTHER BEING FROZEN JAP) ONE OF THOSE RARE ALBUMS YOU CAN LISTEN TO ALL THE WAY THROUGH WITHOUT , HAVING TO SKIP ANYTHING!"
2,The Worst Paul McCartney album.Even Yoko could do better,"Paul McCartney is one of my favorite artist,and he deseves to have a bad record,and this is the one.I have to give it 2 stars because Paul did everything himself on this album. The number 1 single,""Coming up,"" was even different from the way its in here.Paul tried to go New Wave,and it didn't work.I think this was the reason Paul was arrested in Japan in 1980."
1,heh heh...,"Just think... this was the same guy who did ""Penny Lane"" + ""Eleanor Rigby"". Musta been some good stuff he was growing on his ranch..."
1,Paul What were You Thinking/Smoking?,Simply put the worst piece of s**t ever put out by a major artist. Paul what were you thinking/smoking?
3,Awful album,"I'm collecting all McCartney's album, and until now this is the one that I appreciate the least.I dislike all of the synth oriented tracks, and that could be the 85% of the content of this CD, even including the bonus album.I think I will never listen McCartney II again, unless I am at a party with middle aged adults having a bad time."
3,"Lot of fillers, horrible bonus CD",I am glad I didn't get the super deluxe edition as the bonus tracks really are at most awful.The track that really is excruciatingly bad is 'Temporary Secretary' and a few others such as that one.There are some great songs as well thankfully such as Coming Up and Waterfalls.Don't get the deluxe edition unless you are a obsessive fan or collector as the bonus material really is not worth it.
1,Robert Crosbie is an Idiot,"How could you possibly say this is better than Tug of War? I know opinions are like spleens (everybody's got 'em), but where Tug of War had polish and soul, this album is devoid of even the essential Macca charm. It's unholy horrible. It makes The Beach Boys Love You (which hit on the synth craze three years before this tripe) look like Pet Sounds (whereas I've always called Tug of War McCartney's Pet Sounds.) Even the song Waterfalls, which everyone seems to praise here, is way too long. I listened to this one day while driving a long stretch of highway. Thank God it only gave me a headache instead of putting me to sleep.NO STARS for Robert Crosbie."
1,This album gives me a wah-wah,The worst of Paul McCartney--not much more to say. There isn't a memorable song on this whole album-even with the added tracks. Perhaps Paul was trying to be experimental-if so-the experiment created a Frankenstein. I am a McCartney fan--I have all of his cd's--but this one is bad beyond belief.
1,Typical McCartney,"Typical McCartney solo album. One or two good songs, the rest filler (if not junk)."
3,McCartney Alone Again,"McCartney II finds Paul McCartney losing Wings and heading back to style of recording he did on his first solo album. Instead of the down home, easy stylings of the first record, McCartney II finds him experimenting with the new wave, electronic sounds of the time. The album is heavily drenched with keyboards and while it doesn't always work, the spirit of the attempt is true. ""Coming Up"" is an excellent, funky song that in a live version would be his first number one song of the 80's. There are two instrumentals, ""Frozen Jap"" and ""Front Parlour"" aren't too impressive. ""Waterfalls"" is a good ballad as is ""One Of These Days"". Some of the bonus tracks are interesting. ""Blue Sway"" (the first version) is a string-laden almost disco like song. ""Mr. H Atom"" is a strange chanted like song and ""Secret Friend"" is a ten minute spaced out number that ranks as one of the most experimental things he's ever done."
5,Very Happy,"I have not used this product yet. I know it is very good, I have the first volume and I like it. If someone is trying to learn sanskrit, I highly recommend part 1 and part 2 of this particular author. He breaks down the grammar so one can understand this language much better."
3,Still Trying,"Not a fan of this book, its not the book but my lack of willingness to study. I am too lazy for this book. SORRY to my Yoga teacher!"
5,Sammy,I've waited 20 or so years to get all his hit's on one CD. Glad i did and if your a fan you will to.
3,A Glaring Omission Mars This 2-on-1,"Arcadia Records should be commended for being the second import company (along with BGO) to reissue classic Isley Brothers T-Neck albums as 2-on-1s complete with great liner notes and good sound quality. However, there is no excuse to omit ""Layaway"", a top-10 r&b hit, from the two-on-one. The single version of ""Lay Lady Lay"" could have been used instead of the long, drawn-out album version so that ""Layaway"" would fit onto the cd."
2,greatly dissapointing,"...I turn the final page of The World According to Garp by John Irving and reflect on how great a novel it was. How wonderfully it was written, how incredibly unusual and complex the characters were, and how much i understood them. Next, I sit down in front of my tv and watch the movie. To put it nicely, I am appalled at how horrible the movie is. The whole plot is distorted, major characters aren't even mentioned (Harrison and Alice), and the main characters (besides John Lithgow who was excellent as Roberta) aren't portrayed very well by the actors. I do acknowledge though, that the parts are extremely difficult to play and that the actors probably did the best they could. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this movie, ESPECIALLY to people you have read the book, which is absolutely fantastic. Now all of you, go read the book!"
3,Movies are Never as Good as the Book,"Advice: If you love the book, don't see the movie. But that's pretty much true of most movies that were derived from books..."
2,This movie does the book no justice,"After watching the video for The World According to Garp I went and bought the novel by John Irving. After reading about twenty pages I wondered if I picked up the worng book because the movie is so much different. I then finished reading the book and realized what a beuatiful story it is about love, death, and change in which the movie truly did no justice. I think that all copies of the movie should be burned and everyone required to read the book. The only thing that saved this book from a one star review was the oustanding performance from Robin Williams, who truly made the movie watchable."
3,Compared to the book this stunk,"I'm in the 11th grade and I just read the book and i thought that it was incredible. I figured maybe if the book was so good then the movie would be good. Right? WRONG. The movie on its own was ok. If you don't read the book more then likely you wouldn't understand the movie though. Even though i found many differences between the book and dvd. If you want a real treat, read the book. This movie is a good example of why you can't make a 600 page book into a two hour movie. Compared the book, I thought this movie was trash. The book was an incredible piece of literature and this movie came no where close. The actors do do a very good job in the movie and Robin Williams was incredibly. I felt there were many scenes were dissappointing. FOr instance, I found the end very dissapointing. I won't say what happens, but thats just my opinion. Read the book, much better then the movie."
5,This is my favorite movie of all time!!,"This movie made me a Robin Williams fan for life, and also a John Irving fan for life. It is funny, sad, gripping and exciting...just like life. Watch out for the Undertoad!!"
4,Good & Strange,"This is a strange movie but really good, it's hard to explain but I think Forrest Gump was inspired by this movie. It has a surreal yet familiar feel, like some of these things have happened to you."
2,The World According to Garp,"Iwas somewhat disappointed when I recieved the dvd. It was in a plastic type envelope with no packing material. Somewhere between NC and SC it came loose from the spindle holding the dvd in the case. Most likely from like of no packing material. Anyways when I opened it ,it was scratched pretty bad on the recorded side and when I play it, it misses parts of the movie due to the scratches, this is after I had it cleanded, seems the scratches were to deep. Also they gave about a 20day span to deliver this dvd, being in the next state I figured it would get here pretty fast, boy was I wrong.It took almost the full time period to get here from NC. Needless to say I won't purchase anything else from them. I will just need to find someplace local to get a good copy."
3,The World According to Garp,"Although it is a good book and the actors do a wonderful job of portraying the characters, one MUST read the book. The film does not do the book justice at all!!"
2,Can be funny if you watch it with a certain perspective,"I don't think the filmmakers or the author of the book intended to ridicule feminism but this story actually does that quite well. Jennifer (Glenn Close) is clearly a nut case and it is quite amusing to see idiotic women worship her as an icon. She is basically a self-absorbed, man hating b*tch of the worst kind. In fact there is nobody in the entire movie that you are really rooting for, so all that is left is laugh when this bunch of morons finally get their comeuppance or are killed off."
3,worth seeing for Mary Beth Hurt,"The movie based on John Irving's novel depicting the then rising movement of militant feminism and contrasting it with the truly liberated women, typified by Helen. The movie works best when it is lightly satirizing the militants in the first half. In the second, it becomes heavy-handed in its presentation--but then the militants are typically heavy-handed themselves.As a movie, I found the effect somewhat scattered. It doesn't really work as a family-man movie, in spite of the many efforts in that direction. People do muddle through their lives, and in that respect the movie is realistic. But in the end, the effect is more of a so what? than a satisfying experience. And of course, a film about the militant feminists could not be made nowadays.The best thing about the movie is Mary Beth Hurt, whose career more or less ended after this film when she divorced William Hurt and married a business man."
2,"John Irving, where are you?","Mr. Irving in response to this rendering of this novel, said they only got about 1/8th of the story he wrote. They did not do much better with Hotel New Hampshire--how do you do bears that talk? or truly recapture the horrendous rape scenes in World of Garp. Why don't they just leave some of the good books alone?"
5,EXCELLENT ADAPTATION,"Although John Irving's wacky universe is much more detailed in his wonderful novel, this movie captures the essence of his warm messages. The performances, particularly John Lithgow and Glenn Close (film premiere! ), are excellent. You may not be prepared for the topsy-turvy world according to Garp, but if you stay with it, it will stay with you for a long time after. Hits the right balance of humor and sorrow in every major scene."
4,THE INVADE(STEVE ARRINGTON) WAS DA BOMB,"His riffs were amazing and so passionately funky. But Drac and Mark Adams were awesome too! The stars were aligned just right when these cats got 2gether! Too bad ARRINGTON left the group to sing ""dance gospel"". I just saw Slave at Blues Alley on 1-30-06 but non of the original members were there except Mark Adams. And he funked the place up!!! The funkiest bass player of all times! Said he'll be starting a new label or band soon. Let's keep the funk alive!"
5,FIVE STARS ALL THE AWAY AROUND,"Slave is a great Funk music band and I just love these twos albums combind together that sound great. And with Hardness of the word/the concept cd. I sure would also love to have Just A TOUCH OF LOVE/and BAD ENUFF albums on cd. And I love song ""SHAKE IT UP"" like to have longer version with on it. I would give a five stars all away around. Top musics."
5,double take on Da Funk,"Slave was the truth. but Steve Arrington:talk about a cat who took a Band to a whole different level?? Steve Arrington was the truth.His Bass Playing,Drums&His Vocals were outta this world.Brother Arrington coudl Riff like nobody's business.He is so Vastly Underrated. I'm so tired of that Kermit the Frog Singing Pharell Williams jacking Steve Arrington's vocal style in a bad mocking style.keith Sweat was strainging to try to cover Steve Arrington's style as well.Steve Arrington just Brought the Funk Pain Period.this is a Slamming tight Double shot here. the Bass Lines,Drums,Guitar,keys. Bout time the Funk is released.Props to the Greatness that is Steve Arrington."
3,A good DVD set,"When I bought this set, it had been quite a while since i had watched an episode of ""Three's Company"". Admittedly, the show isn't quite what I remembered, but it's still a great set for anyone who is a ""Three's Company"" fan."
5,Three's Company is a classic!,"Yeah, I too went straight for the first pilot! Wow, that was wierd! Thank God for Joyce and Suzanne! I can't wait to see the second pilot with Joyce and without Suzanne! I was impressed with the quality of the bloopers. The John Ritter tribute is definitely emotional and I can tell Joyce DeWitt was getting teary-eyed doing it. I hope they continue the high quality production on the upcoming seasons. Three's company was at it's best in seasons 3 through 6. Thank you ""Anchor Bay"" for giving this classic the tribute it deserves. Why can't Columbia/Sony/Tristar do that with their shows. It's a shame that some of my other favorite shows are distributed by that company. Keep up the good work Anchor Bay!"
4,Very Cool,"I have to say is that the Unaired pilot was very different from what I thought it would be. The writting, I thought, was much better than in 'Man about the house'. The theme music in the beginning was horrible! I'am so glad they fixed that. I liked Valarie Curtin as 'Jenny' but I didn't like Suzanne Zenor as 'Samantha'. But we all know that the right decision with casting Joyce DeWitt and Suzanne Somers.I like the way the box-set is layed out. It's very cool that it's in a book like case. The special features are great:)"
5,Very pleased.,The product was in great shape. Bought for a friend and we are both very happy with the transaction. Thankyou.
4,Still as good as ever!,"Must say that Three's Company Season Two is a good laugh! It is still as funny as ever. Some older shows 'look old' and 'sound old' but the humour in this series holds its own! In my opinion the second season team of actors is beginning to get 'tuned up' in harmony with each other. I've shown some of these episodes to younger people who weren't old enough to see this show and they are laughing out loud at this 29 year old series! Well done to the writers, actors and all who made Three's Company such a classic!"

4,Love Vanilla!,"I've used V'Tae products in the past, which is why I bought this vanilla. Not only is the scent lovely, but the product is cruelty free. I can't understand people who think they deserve to smell nice at the cost of another being's life. I feel good about using this product."
4,great entertainer,George Strait is really great. He sings very well and does not try to over-do the song - he lets the song tell the story.
5,This is a great album,This is a great album! It has a nice variety of songs and is pure George Strait. I like every song on it.
5,Perfection!,"What else can you say about this incredible man. He is what ""country music"" is all about. Long live George Strait!!!"
5,It's George Strait.....why even ask? This CD is another WINNER,"This cd is yet another album in which every song is a classic and covers an array of music. From slow sad songs like ""He Must Have Really Hurt You Bad"" to the rockin song ""Texas Cookin'"". When on most cd's there are 2 or 3 songs you may like on other artists cd's, like usual evey one on this album you will like. Like I said before, another awsome group from our buddy George."
4,His Best CD in 10 Years,"Something strange happened about ten years ago...after ""Carrying Your Love With Me"". The ultimate country superstar, George Strait, started putting out inferior quality CDs. They might be good for a hit or two, but were very forgettable. You would spend your money expecting to get a thoroughly good record, but all you got was a couple of good songs. This CD is completely enjoyable. Aside from a couple of cuts, bringing it down to 4 stars for me, this is his return to greatness. Best songs are the title cut, Wrapped, Come On Joe, How Bout Them Cowgirls and A Heart Like Hers. This CD is easily six or seven singles deep for country radio. Glad to see he has not lost his touch!"
5,BEST KING GEORGE ALBUM SINCE CHILL OF AN EARLY FALL!,this cd all the way through is a masterpiece. thats all there should be said about it. it should win country album of the year at the cma's monday night but it was released too late and nominations had been already made. he'll win it next year. everyone watch the cma's they are going to inducted him into the hall of fame.download these...1.Give It Away2.She Told Me So3.Wrapped (MY PERSONAL FAVORITE)4.It Just Comes Natural ( his next #1 hopefully)5.Why Can't I Leave Her alone
4,FACM ( French Association of Country Music,"No more enough of fingers to count the number of George Strait's albums, no more enough of expressions to qualify his talent, but here, this new album is excellent. Big George Strait. The ""dream team"" musicians: Eddie Bayers to the drum, Glenn Worf to the bass, Brent Mason to the guitar, Stuart Duncan to the fiddle, Wes Hightower to the choir, Paul Franklin to the steel, etc, etc. ..! A finely mastered sound, and as usual, a lot of pieces mid-tempos sublimate of which hits ""give it away"", ""it just comes natural"" or ""how 'bout them cowgirls "", and also honky tonk, western swing like "" Texas cookin'"". Well, 15 traditional titles, of course without surprised, but this that George Strait, without surprised but we know that's will be well ! Nothing to say more, except that George Strait did not do country music, George Strait is the country music. It's natural![...]"
5,GEORGE IS THE MAN!!!,LOVE HIM LOVE HIM LOVE HIMWhat can I say...George is IT!This CD is one of his BEST EVER!BUY IT!!
3,Disappointing,"Especially after the brilliant, contemplative maturity of Somewhere Down in Texas, It Just Comes Natural is starkly disappointing. George Strait is nothing without song selection and his generally unerring skill in that area faltered. Most of these songs - even the released singles - are a throw back to George in the mid-80's but lack the charm of those early classics."
3,"Not so ""Natural""...","As a recent convert to country music, I must say this recording doesn't stack-up to other country recording artists, like Randy Travis.There is too much vocal over-dubbing on this recording which makes it sound far too commercialised and unnatural. I thought that was what country music was all about - getting down to a natural sound. Mr Strait has a fine country voice, and there should be no need to incorporate this unnatural sound in his recordings."
4,It works,It fits our old bowl and was a reasonably priced replacement for a lid I broke when I dropped it.
4,Just like the original,"Yep, it's just like the original. Fits properly. Expensive though. I wish that Cuisinart parts were priced a little more appropriately, so minus one star for that."
5,Winter is a gem,"I honestly don't undestand why Johnny doesn't get the credit he does. I stumbled on Johnny Winter a few yeats ago, after never before hearing a song by him. It's good that he is respected as much as he is in the guitar world, but I am surprised how little known he is. It may be over-the-top saying he's as good as Hendrix, but he definetly gets close, and his sound is one of the most Hendrixian I've heard. Now as far as the cd goes, I think this is both an excellent start to Winter as well as a kind entrance into the blues. If anyone were to ask me which blues artist to listen to first, I would say Winter. I can also strongly recommend this cd to any Johnny Winter fan. Enjoy!"
2,Bottoms Up,"As I am relatively new to the genre of ""Erotica,"" this book left me mildly disappointed. The structure of the book, deemed by the publishers to be 'a selection of novelettes,' is really more a hodge-podge of descriptive sexual trysts by undeveloped characters. If one is seeking numerous descriptions of buttocks and some gratuitous but timid S&M, this might be the book for you. It's short, somewhat formulaic, and is written more from the male's point of view; still, it's a rather genteel introduction to erotica."
4,My experience with this cd/dvd cleaner,"Product works great. The only draw back that I have to it is that the majority of my disks required the maximum cleaning. The last step in the cleaning of CD/DVD device is the one that required that you, in order to clean more CDs, reorder the discs. At the requirement that you spend more....."
3,"Has a lot of good info, but presentation is *quite* slanted.","Ms. Dionne presents a lot of information which is good, but she has obviously had difficulties with doctors and is all but hostile in discussing them. She is right in that you really should question whether your doctor is giving you advice based on your specific circumstance or based on his/her own preferences. Also, she does what she complains the doctors do in that her book is heavily slanted toward her own medical preferences.She does point out some things I hadn't thought of, but you need to read this book with the understanding that she is pressing her own agenda. Not that she's right or wrong, just that she may not be presenting all the information in an unbiased manner.Overall, not bad reading, I found more info on the web, but it took longer that way."
3,If you have read any info on the internet...,"regarding fibroids, then you don't need this. I got it at a used bookstore and did not read anything interesting, or that I didn't already know."
3,Geeks verse Sweats,"Loser new kid named Greg moves to London from the country and has trouble making friends at his new school and his parents don't give him enough attention anymore since the birth of his new sister. While hanging out at the abanoned toilet block he comes across Sean, a Sweat (jock) tied upside down over the toilet. After releasing him he gets publicly thanked by the teachers and Oliver king of the geeks who put Sean there trys to become his best friend. So does the leader of the Sweats and Greg has to choose sides. Oliver's dad is also the author of a popular Harry Potter rip off series but no one knows for sure as Oliver is a bit on the insane side. Greg finds out his mentally disturbed could be friend wants to give the leader of the Sweats the ultimate drop and has to decide what to do about it. Is he going to be a Sweat or a Geek? Decisions, decisions......."
4,Heart Beat Well Felt !,"Whatever you want to call this collection, house, dance, pop, it's all good...This time Sakamoto has updated his pop-eclectic dance sound a notch or two from his previous titles...He shows he can still keep in touch and move with the times (even for the early 90's). Yet, the music maintains it's Japanese musical influences. One of the sweetest ear catching tracks is Sayonara (Good-bye) as Sakamoto sings with the silky background female vocals singing ""sayonara""...All other tracks are pretty much a menagerie of catchy and dance accessible tunes !"
5,07 SRX,"quality replacement filter, with a WIX filter you can't go wrong. I use WIX filters on all of my construction equipment & tractors.It was hard to remove the plastic cover over the filter on the SRX Not much room to release the tabs on the sides. but once removed swapping the filter was easy."
1,Not what I hoped for,"I hoped I could embrace this book, because the premise sounded appealing, but I'm sorry to say it could not hold my attention and never got my interest."
4,"Good, but buy the equivalent Haynes manual instead if you can.",The manual is good but I also bought a copy of the competing Haynes manual as well in the same order figuring what one didn't cover the other would and between the two I would be set. I would have been just fine if I had bought only the Haynes manual it has everything the Chilton's manual has as far as I can tell plus it is better in my opinion. That may not be true with repair manuals covering other makes/models/years but for this specific notch the Haynes manual is the better one of the two.
5,An author with a subtle touch,"While this is obviously a work of fiction, it's clear that the author has some strong feelings about various political issues. The thing I like about it is that he manages to get his message across without beating the reader over the head with it. Everything the characters say seems totally justified and believable in terms of their literary development (which is quite detailed-you definitely feel like you know them very quickly). This is the third book I've read by J.P. Befumo (the first two, ""Oranur Conspiracy"" and ""The Space Between Time"") are currently out of print-too bad), and I look forward to seeing more of what he can do."
4,A Truly Original Work,"This is one of the more original works I've read in a long, long time. In these days when everyone is trying to write their own knock-off of someone else's success story, it's definitely refreshing to encounter someone who isn't afraid to be innovative. I particularly liked the way the author juggles multiple, intertwined story lines, each merging in an entirely organic way, resulting in a cohesive whole. The characters all seem like people you've known or might expect to encounter-completely believable, even the inscrutable cult leader."
5,This book can Save Your Marriage !,"This book was great. As I read it , I was so glad to see that other women are just like me. My husband read it and it radically changed the way he treated me. He just needed to understand where I was coming from and what I needed. Men and women are so-ooo different. I have also been enlightened as to what his needs are, and try to meet them better. I have recommended this book to MANY couples whose marriages are in trouble or could just use a boost! I believe that if you apply what it says ,it can save a failing marriage."
4,"Pianos, parties, and no one to whom you come home","Critics over-rated Ringo Starr's RINGO album. GOODNIGHT VIENNA is one of several Starr LPs they under-rated. This CD version includes the glass-shattering ""Back Off Boogaloo,"" making purchase even more worthwhile, along with the hits ""Only You"" and ""No No Song."" Starr and Vini Poncia turn in the stand-out ""All By Myself,"" sort of the theme of GOODNIGHT VIENNA, a collection of single-man (Ringo's marriage busted up when he made this album in 1974) loneliness and party songs. Groove on the piano-playing by Billy Preston and others throughout the disc. GOODNIGHT VIENNA has been bad-mouthed so much that its substance will surprise you if you actually listen."
4,Lots of musical horsepower from a damn good band.,"Ringo will go down in musical history as ""The least annoying Beatle"". We all sort of thought when the fab four quit that Ringo would end up in one of those ""Where are they now?"" columes in Rolling Stone magazine. No such deal. He proved to be a hell of a musician, a top rate drummer and knows how to always surround himself with the best in the biz. Paul should take some notes. Such was the case with Goodnight Vienna. I love this album!! A first class turn-it-up-loud and blow the f**kin speaker cones out on the floor recording. Ringo had to work a bit trying to find himself a band after the Beatle split but it didnt take long. Goodnight Vienna is a hot 70's post Beatle rocker that plays well in the 21st century. The title cut is a John Lennon contribution that could only have been a Ringo tune. You'll never hear a rock vocalist with no vibrato, projection and range crank it out like Ringo did on this album."
2,please remove your hands from your ears...,"ok, come clean - who thinks ringo is a good drummer? it's ok, you can stop rushing for the exits because the truth is that, well, here it ceases to matter. what does matter is that, bless him, he's by no means in the song-writing league of his erstwhile partners-in-creativity messrs. lennon and, er, what was the other guy's name? i'm sure that ringo has a talent - i am one of those nursery school teacher types who's convinced that everybody must have a talent - but no evidence of it, in whatever field it may ultimately lie, is on this disc. but having said all this: go on, buy the thing, and satisfy your curiosity, because you're not getting anything more out of me..."
3,"I've embraced this album better than most people, I think","Although his 1973 album ""Ringo"" was his biggest solo success, I think Goodnight Vienna harbored some great songs. Sure, you have the hits ""No No Song"", and ""Only You"", but a few of his other non-hits on this album are actually more catchy than most of the non-hits on the ""Ringo"" album. Plus, as one of the few bonus tracks here, you get his higher charting hit ""Back Off Boogaloo"" which is not so bad.I like shuffling all my Beatle solo songs together in my carousel player, because that way I get the feel of listening to The Beatles as if they were all still together. It's pretty cool to watch Ringo performing today with his all-star band. I'm happy to see that Ringo Starr is still going strong even today."
1,doesn't fit,"the amazon program determined this cabin air filter fit my 2006 grand vitara, but after i received it i realized this filter doesn't fit my car. this filter is 2 pieces but my car only use one piece cabin air filter and the size is totally different. I returned it and got the TYC cabin air filter from amazon."
1,same thing with different brand,"same thing happened with me. i ordered Fram CF8726A because Fram's web-site states it fits my Suzuki XL7 2003, and on amazon.com it says fits my car, but it doesn't. same 2 peace filter received, but car has 1 and different size. I called Fram's technical support and they working on the problem. as i understand, when they decide to design filter, they request original from dealer, and built their own according to specs (mostly dimensions). if they get the wrong filter from dealer (thats how Fram gets the original), then the design is wrong. they'll have to recall all of them and change model # for new fitment specifications."
3,Its Okay,smells great it was a gift for my mom i didnt expect it to be so tiny but i guess you get what you pay for.
5,Love it!,This fragrance is fantastic. Not too strong. daffodil and vanilla subtlety. I will buy it again and again and again.
4,A Scent of Wonder,"I really enjoyed this product. I bought it as a gift for my mother. She loved it. She said that the scent was unique and not like what she is used to. The only things that wre a problem were that it is very exspensive for such a small bottle. Another thing is that it was deliverd close to a week after the assinged delivery date. Other than that, Ireally like it.Burberry by Burberry for Women, .15 oz Mini EDP"
4,Burberry by Burberry,"I am very happy with this fragrance. It is light and pleasant and doesn't give me a headache. My boyfriend has allergies and is often affected by perfume, and I am too. I ordered this because he knew it was one he liked and didn't react to, and we are very pleased with it. Some perfumes also turn on me and smell cheap or like an insecticide, and this one does not."
1,RIP OFF RIP OFF,it says it says .17 oz i did not get that I received .15 oz FALSE ADVERTISEMENT why would you say itas .17 oz and not shipp that
5,great fragrance,"I bought the small bottle , due to not being sure what to expect...............love it, and the price is so great for a small get to know fragrance."
4,Burberry,A little lighter than I expected. A wonderful scent;but must be applied more than once.Could be a little stronger. Meshes well with her body odor.
2,Ok,DID NOT look like this picture at all and was way smaller than it appears. Not even the same fragrance as the original.
1,worst perfume I've ever had,the scent of it is so terrible for me. it smells like an out-of-fashion middle aged woman. it is really a waste of my money to buy this one.
1,really disappointed by the dealy in the shipping of this product,"I had ordered this and one another perfume for my sister to gift her on her birthday, but now her birthday is all gone. It was showing that the product will be delivered by latest of 4th of this month, today is 6th and its still not delivered. I am big fan of Amazon, but this delay really disappointed me."
1,Obviously Written by a Dooms-Dayer!,"I was very disappointed in this book. Not only was much of the information out of date, many of the contacts were unreachable, but my feeling is the author is promoting the dooms-dayer mentality. He must feel the US banks are out to steal his money with the advise he has to offer. I feel this book does more harm than good to the global financial industry."
2,"Thoughtful, but amateurish.","This CD seems like a great first release, and I applaud the branching out from past projects. On the other hand, most of the tracks feel like caricatures electronic music. And while I enjoy the music from his television projects, as a standalone CD I don't feel that the Power Puff demos have a place here."
5,SLAMMIN',"I have never been a huge fan of Nutter Butters, only because I wasn't fond of the cookie part of it..but with these wafers the cookies are out of the equation. The only downside of these things is the fact that I will sit and eat the whole package!!! Try them you will not be dissappointed."
2,What a boring and uninformative book!,"Ed McNeely's book does little to inspire or inform. It is set out poorly. Each chapter starts with a picture of two 19th century gentlemen sweep rowing in what, no doubt, are thick, woollen tights. This is commendable honesty, because you are about to be enveloped in thick woolly text and diagrams.I found little new in the book. Some of the information in it was so obtuse as to be useless. For example, the discussion of aerobic training categories is long-winded and the workout examples so vague that it would require extra reading to work out what to do. McCarthur's High Performance Rowing does it so much better.Sorry Ed, your book is uninspiring, but I am glad you got your masters degree allright! Unfortunately, I cannot imagine many Canadians being inspired to get out on the water, or even to hit the erg regularly!"
5,A seminal record for a generation,"It's awfully sad to hear that this CD is out of print, because it spoke to the hearts of a whole generation of kids growing up in the eighties and early nineties. Hearing these records, when I was fourteen, taught me about the power of music not just as entertainment but as path of spiritual and political growth. Beefeater's idealism, and its sound, would probably come across as awfully dated to someone encountering it for the first time in 2003, but the band should be remembered for the crucial role it played in our lives."
5,download the book for free,"It's heartbreaking that people are selling copies of this book for $250 - $2,000+Use your search engine, you can find it for free on line."
2,Cancer: Curing the incurable,This book is very disappointing. Nothing what one would expect after reading the description. Case histories are not valid evidence based facts. I would not encourage my patients to follow it.
3,book on cancer,"I really can not say too much about the book becaused I have not had the chance to read a whole lot, so far it seems fine"
5,Dr. Dean Doesn't Disappoint,"I'm not someone who normally buys medical guides. This one came to me as a gift, and I have really enjoyed it. I found it to be well written and well organized, neither too technical nor too basic. The format makes the information accessible. As a special added bonus, it's entertaining. I liked it."
2,average,"got this Soundtrack Mainly for R.kelly's ""I Believe""&It's cool. the rest of the soundtrack is Hit&alot of Miss.Trick Daddy's ""take it to the House"" is catchy but mainly because of Him Sampling Kc&The Sunshine Band.it's a aight set."
2,Song Name,Does anyone know the name of the song at the beginning of the movie where the helicopter is in search of the germs? Please e-mail me at Tao5932@aol.com if you know.
4,Review,"I agree, that the anime is not as good as the manga. I've read the first and I think the second of the manga series and the anime doesn't follow those completely. However, the animation is decent, the voices aren't all that bad considering they could be a lot worse, and all around the story is pretty good. I've seen some bad anime and I've read some pretty bad manga as well. I don't think this fits into the category of either of them. Blade of the Immortal is good either way. It may not be the best, but it's good and it tells the story it was meant to tell."
3,Budget-Line Greatest Hits Collection,"This is an interesting, if nonesssential budget-CD greatest-hits compo with their cover of Hendrix's ""Burning Of The Midnight Lamp"" which is not available on any other release. Its a decent intro, and contains the absolute barest essentials from _Vivid_ but the selection from _Time's Up_ ... and only one song from _Stain_ leaves something to be desired. Still worth picking up for fans if you dont have the Hendrix cover elsewhere - plus its dirt cheap."
4,a good solid disc,"i always enjoyed this group.something that is downplayed a rock-n-roll black group? they had the chops of vernon reid&corey clover leading the crew.cult of personality,elvis is dead which features little richard is great.it's great to see african-americans playing rock-n-roll since it was created by african-americans but has since been downplayed.living colour was a good group."
3,"Not the best Obi-Wan Kenobi 12"" figure","This Obi-Wan Kenobi figure (styled from his appearance in Star Wars: A New Hope) was one of the first in the 12"" Collector Series line. It's not the work of art that the later Sideshow figures are, but I really enjoyed Kenner's `90s 12"" figure line.Pros - The outfit is very detailed, and is fairly accurate to the film. I love the rough Jedi robe, and the lightsaber is pretty cool too (though the hilt doesn't detach like later Jedi figures).Cons - This doesn't really look like Ben Kenobi at all. They did a pretty poor job with the heads for that first run of figures. It also suffers from limited articulation. They used a G.I. Joe figure body, which meant rubbery, less-poseable arms and legs.It pales in comparison to theStar Wars Episode IV Obi-Wan Kenobi 12 Inch Figure by Sideshow Collectibles, but this Obi-Wan Kenobi figure isn't too bad overall. This was the ""chase"" figure in the initial assortment, so it's not as easy to find as the other three."
3,More hype than nuts and bolts.,"Although the book is very informative as far as being immaginative in Real Estate transactions, Mr. Allen never gives any details of his deals. This book is responsible however for me buying several houses with a little elbow grease and some ideas generatded with this book."
1,DISMAL,"Undoubtedly one of the worst detective stories I have ever read - although I did finish it. The heroine is a former nun (definitely not my type), the dialogue is quite wooden (most conversations consist of extremely rude interrogation by the heroine and expressions of appreciation by all those to whom she speaks - there is absolutely no interplay). As none of the characters is given any personality, it is a very sketchy story. Never again"
5,Robert Goulet A Personal Christmas Collection,"I love this CD, I listened to the LP in college 34 years ago! I have looked for it before and couldn't find it...it brings me back."
5,I <3 Robert Goulet!,"Christmas just wouldn't be Christmas without Robert Goulet! It's wonderful to hear his voice again on all of these songs. My personal favorite is ""This Christmas I Spend with You."" ""Christmas Day"" is a song I haven't heard very often, but R.G.'s rendition is terrific! Every song on this CD is a winner!!! If you love Robert Goulet and Christmas music, this CD is for you!!"
5,Wonderful retro Christmas Album,"This wonderful Robert Goulet Christmas Album was part of my youthful Christmas memories. Lately I've been collecting retro Christmas and other retro music albums. This Albumn is great addition to my colllection; even if only for the song: ""This Christmas I'll spend with you""."
5,Great Product,"Hi,My little 6year old girl loves these wafers; they may be a bit much for the smaller kids. Great product for the price; seems to improve her stamina and disease fighting mechanisms (and I am in India). For the guy who made the comment about magnesium stearate - the fact that these are chewable effectively takes care of that problem as all the vitamins and minerals wil be readily absorbed. Also, while magnesium stearate delays absortion it certainy does not prevent absorption"
2,OK PRODUCT,I LIKED THIS PRODUCT AT FIRST BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN IT MOST DONT HAVE. tHEN I FOUND OUT IT HAD MAGNESIUM STEARATE WHICH LESSONS THE ABSORPTION OF THE VITAMINS BY 60%!!!
3,Kid doesn't care for them.,My two year old doesn't care for these. I think it's the taste. They aren't bad in my opinion as far as taste goes. It's a nice size bottle that will last a while if you've only got one kid taking them.The wafers are pretty big though. So they could be a choking hazard. But the bottle does say to break them up if you think they are too big.
5,The kids love it,"The vitamin has a lot in it, and my kids love taking it. I'm convinced from the size that they're getting more than you would with your average gummy vitamin as well. This might mostly be in the form of calcium, i don't know"
1,Taste awful!!,"These are the worst tasting vitamins ever! I don't mind the vitamin taste....expected that. It's hard to describe how bad they taste.....can't get past it. Too bad, because they seem to be a good product and have no artificial sweeteners. Maybe they need a little bit (or a lot) of sweetners (artificial or otherwise), which is what I was trying to avoid. Yuck!!"
1,Horrible taste,"and smell. I could not get my 9 yr. olds to take these. One kid would not even taste after smelling them. They may be great vitamins but if you can't get them IN the kids, it doesn't matter."
1,Buy this if you like eating fiberboard!,"Well, I'm sure these provide great nutrition, but not if the kids won't take them. I tasted one because my son would not eat them and let me say these are absolutely the worst tasting vitamin. So, while they are chock full of good stuff, they are, equally, chock full of nasty taste. YUK!!!!!"
5,Magnificent!,"I am usually not a short story fan, but I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this collection. Highsmith is such a fabulous writer that you are completely drawn into her stories and can't wait to turn the page. Some of her stories in previous collections haven't been my cup of tea. But in this collection, Highsmith shows herself as a writer's writer and gives readers a wonderful gift of perfectly crafted stories that will stay with you long after you close the cover."
3,Eh....okay read,The book was very short and not too helpful. Some stuff was very cool to read and inspired me to change certain things about myself (towards the glam) but it wasn't a great book....just okay.
2,Wasn't enough for my cat,"My cat is 20+ lbs. and she suffers from Megacolon, a condition that causes severe constipation. I bought this to save me numerous and costly trips to the vet, just to they could administer an enema. However, this was not enough to relieve my cat. Even after two she was still having a problem. Now I buy the super size ones right from my vet. I guess if your cat is normal sized it may work but please be careful using it. Your vet should show you how. If you don't know what you're doing you could severely injure your cat."
5,Great to work with,I ordered the 6ml Pet Ema accidently instead of the 12ml. Rivival was great to work with on shipping back the ones I did not want and getting the right ones quickly.
3,"Loved this watch, but...","I absolutely loved this watch at first! However, after wearing it pretty consistently for a couple of months, the varnish started to peel off of the wood links, and after two and a half months one of the wood links split and fell off. I wasn't particularly harsh with the watch; I treated it well and took it off before doing anything that might damage it.For a watch that costs this much, it should last longer than just two months. Plus, the Fossil warranty only covers the watch face, not the band, so it costs money to send it back and have it fixed."
5,Rick the Ruler has Returned,"This album is definitely worth a listen. Slick Rick has gotta be one of the most sampled artists of all time. For that reason alone, he deserves respect. But this album is clearly worth the money. ""All praise to the ruler,"" for he has regained his title with his comeback album. ""Ricky is the nigga, don't forget it."""
4,"Yep, this is a good cd.","I have this latest Slick Rick CD (said by Amazon to be released 01/2000). If you want info on it, mail me at superduo@hotmail.com. I'm even willing to talk business. The storyteller is indeed back."
4,slcik rick - art of story tellin,"Slick Ricks first album since hie release from prison, seems to have all the elements for a hipop classic. Never has there been an LP that has been able to combine all styles of hiphop into one album. The Rulers laid back style helps his lyrics to flow smoothly into the listeners making them sit and ponder upon the world that Rick is allowing you to get a glimpse of. And at the same time has your head bouncing to the bassy bets on each and every track.. This album features the contributions of such mc's as; Nas, Run Dmc, Snoop Doogy Dog, Q- tip from a tribe called quest, Peter Gunz,, and the beat boxing talents of Dougie fresh. Each Track seems to flow into each other until the very end. When you ear is left begging for more. I haven't taken this album out of my CD player since I bought. Its your decision. But I defiantly wouldn't pass this album up."
1,And the man calls himself slick. This is garbage.,"Slick Rick should have never been release from jail. Especially another record like this. America don't waste your money. I mean Slick Rick is still in the 80's. Ricky, just think the millenium."
4,1 of,the greatest come backs of the year I like about every song on this one it had gotten a whole lot of replay from me hot music!!!!
4,The Lost Art of Storytelling...it's like 1989 all over again,"The Art of Storytelling is the oasis in the hip hop desert that fans have been thirsting for since the ""Golden Age of Hip Hop"" ended in 1991. Free from the mandatory gun-shot skits or money, cash, hoes recipe that seemingly is the recipe for every other new release, Ricky D gets back to the visual MC painting portraits. Songs like ""Two Way Street"" show how he has matured in his views of women. He still shows that old ""I'll crush anybody on the mic attitude"" in ""Frozen"" and ""Me and Nas Bring It To Your Hardest"", back when it was fun to brag and talk about other mc's without fearing for your safety. The beats on this album are all tight for the most part, and compliment Rick's still strong storytelling skills. IF you are tired of hearing rah-rah mc's talk about how much ice they have or how much weed they smoke, then I suggest you cop this album on the quickfast. What the drilly with that though...It is bangin!"
4,La di da di--- this is the reason to party,"The Ruler returns with , er, um well an album that only the Ruler could pull off. Go get it and pump the beats. La di da di ---- We like to party"
3,"Ok, but I would recommend you buy the book and cd","The dvd to me was ok, but it skipped over a lot of basic things which I assume he covers in the book and cd."
5,The Adventure Continues,"This second installment is every bit as good as the first book. The story is starts off running and never slows down. Allston does an excellent job of conveying the characters emotions, and does it without interrupting the flow of the story. The story is clear and easy to follow despite the various subplots and numerous characters. I highly recommend the two books in this series, and I am keeping my fingers crossed that there is a third, and fourth, and..."
5,Helps out!,"I have learned that the Cayenne pills help with metabolism but don't expect a high weightloss. It is a slow drop. Also it helps ""clean"" your system. Just make sure you plan the time frame from when you take it because you will be having to use the restroom rather quickly. But the Cayenne pills do help."
3,It does the job--decently.,"I was going on a long overseas flight to central asia, one I had done before and knew that the in flight movies wouldn't be in English. I decided to invest in a portable DVD player and knew that I wanted to watch more then one movie (14 hour flight). So I picked up the spare battery. It lasted about 3-3 1/2 hours, so it did what I was expecting. About the only thing I don't like is that you need to press a button on the side of the battery to check its charging status, rather then it just flashing green when it's done and red when it's not."
1,"Does it work? I""ll never know","I ordered this item a few days prior to a trip my family would be taking, a 16 hour flight, so a strong battery was paramount for the portable DVD player. It arrived on a Friday and the trip was on Sunday. Upon opening it I discovered the cord that connects the battery to the DVD player was missing. I don't know whose at fault, Amazon or Lenmar but without that item the battery is useless. Thanks, whomever, for making a 16 hour flight that much more difficult."
1,"Not comfortable, difficult to fit","I tried this Neotech strap along with theNeotech Mega Accordion Harness, Black. I found the Mega strap to be extremely comfortable, but this one to be very uncomfortable. The contoured design did not seem to fit my body shape. Build quality and materials seem very good, though. Thus the reason for 2 stars. I did email the company to report my problems to see if they had any solutions. I have not received a reply yet, so I am taking off 1 additional star for poor customer service."
4,These are nice,"I bought these for my Hohner Doubleray B/C. I bought them because I was having some back pain and had heard that a harness with 3 straps would help. So far, it appears to be working.Attaching the strap to the top of the accordion was easy. To attach to the bottom of the accordion, I had to unscrew the bulkhead connector, which took a little bit of time. Other than that, these straps are great (5 stars)."
3,Very disappointing after the glowing reviews,"I found this book to be nothing more than the usual cookie-cutter romance. The hero is handsome and troubled, their romance is doomed to fail, etc.Neither the hero nor heroine were well defined. They seemed very two-dimensional and I honestly didn't care what happened to them. There were so many other characters in the story-line (gods, goddesses, assorted immortals) that their relationship never had a chance to develop.I suppose the fact that the heroine is the reincarnation of the hero's long dead wife was supposed to explain how they fell instantly in love, without knowing anything about each other and never having had a conversation about anything more meaningful than bean sprouts vs. Oreos for dinner.I am new to Sherrilyn Kenyon novels, so perhaps this book would have been more interesting if I had read the earlier books in the series. But based on the poor quality of this novel, I won't be buying any more of her books."
1,Fire the publisher!!,"""John Keitz"" and ""Ivy avid reader"" reviews are DEAD ON!!!PLease take the time to read both reviews. I recommend not reading Night Embrace at all, but if you have to...Do yourselves a favor and get this from a friend or library. This book started our very well and had so much potential only to intoduce a female lead that hit on every raw nerve I could stand.It was like the chalkboad and fingernail torture. What ever thoughts (I use that term loosely) that our good heroine, Sunshine, might have rattles around in her empty head until I went NUTS!!!Not only was she an idiot, but she had no shame at all. Sunshine followed the vampire around like a FEMALE DOG in heat! I couldn't even get past the first couple of chapters. My best advise for this poor vampire and any other male in her vacinity is to quickly get away or castrate themselves and jam ice picks in their ears. As a reader my eyes have been assaulted by this crap and I shall try and quickly put this behind me."
3,No dust cover,I had sent an e-mail to the vender and never received a reply. The dust cover or paper cover was missing on the book and it did not mention this in the books discription. So I was not really happy about this because I save all these books.
5,It is Fun and great to read..,The Dark hunter series Is great it makes you want to more I can not wait until the next books comes Out...
4,Leather and Harleys rocking your romance!!,"Sherrilyn Kenyon is repeatedly demonstrating her wonderful talents to the delight of fans and new readers alike. The humorous tones meshed with emotion and action is nothing less than wonderful in the Dark Hunter series.I started this book in much the same way I use to take on a program of Buffy. It wasn&#65533;t my first preference, but I was entertained enough to get through it. However, this book grabbed me and pulled me into the story. It contains a sufficient mixture of vampires and werewolves showing up at just the right moments to keep the story interesting the tale moving. Grant it, the image of Harley riding heroes that have women coming on to them in groves was a bit much, but acceptable.All in all, if you are a paranormal romance fan, you may find this book a tad farfetched, but it will still entertain you."
4,"Intricate, Yet Motives Don't Match Characters","No one will get bored with this book, that's for sure. It's the first for me by this author, so I'm anxious to read the others, especially Kyrian's story.But....There wasn't an ugly or even average-looking person in ALL of New Orleans, it seemed. EVERYone wore leather, too.Mostly, it made no sense that these Dark-Hunter's would kill to protect humans when they seemed to want to kill each other instead. There was a real and ugly hatred between these guys. They could viciously kill anyone and feel no guilt, so it just wasn't believable that they would care one way or the other about the safety of complete strangers."
3,3 1/2 stars,"Love Talon but had difficulty with Sunshine. I don't like Sunshine I think she is too contrived, tooooooooo... I don't have the words for her. I couldn't no matter what I did identify with her.I didn't like the whole reincaration theme going on.. and felt the whole ""Only-One"" thing was just too much for me to handle. I was disapointed but loved that Kenyon used Cetic Mythology."
2,Too much of everything bad,"I wish I hadn't listened to the positive reviews for this book on Amazon. Usually, the reviews don't do me wrong, but this time, uggh.This book took me a long time to finish. Kenyon's plot lines are so convoluted I just couldn't keep them straight. I never really understood the Daimon part from the previous novel because it is way too complicated, but she takes it even further in this novel, adding more gods and mixing in more plots and characters. I know she has to set up for other novels, but the set ups are just confusing. The ending almost completely skips the characters that have been emphasized for the whole book (thank god for the epilogue).I am going to stop with this series. Jullian and Kyrian's stories were adorable, but this book just derailed the series and I cannot continue."
3,Not quite up to par,"I've read and completely enjoyed Kenyon's other novels (as well as those she has written as Kinley MacGregor). If the writing in the other novels was a little weak, I never really noticed (or was at least able to overlook) since the story and ideas were fresh, and the characters engaging. Dialogue is a bit banal at times, but overall well written and often witty. With this novel, however, Kenyon dropped the ball somewhat. It's still an entertaining read, and for already fans of Kenyon, well worth the buy. But. As another reviewer noted, Kenyon seems to have mistaken unabashed lust-fest for true love. The characters seemed a little flat in part because of this. And since the characters fell short, it made me more aware of the weak writing. Definitely not one of the better novels in the series or for Kenyon, but good enough for light reading, and not so awful that I won't pick up her future books."
2,Not a keeper,"This was my first read by Sherrilyn Kenyon and while I found it to be somewhat fun it just couldn't hold my interest that much. I found the idea of the Dark Hunters to be an interesting one but found the love story between Talon and Sunshine to be rather boring. Really, I enjoy a good paranormal romance, but the typical ""reincarnated soulmate"" plot in many novels of this type has worn a bit thin for me. This was rather humorous in dialogue and characters, but its not a ""keeper"" for me."
5,I love the Dark Hunter Series!,"Please do not read this book if you have not read Fantasy Lover and Night Pleasures first.I enjoyed Nights Embrace. I thought SK added more detail to this book than in past books, but I realize she may be doing this because of the long list of Dark Hunter books to come in the future.I couldn't help but feel like Nights Embrace was more of an introduction to the excitement to come. It didn't ruin the book for me. I still laughed and got caught up in the story, but in the back of mind I was left wondering.Make sure to visit her website to read more about the Dark Hunters, their profiles, books and coming soon dates.Sherrilyn Kenyon has created the ultimate fantasy world!!!"
3,I really wanted to like this book!,"Okay, I must not be the target audience for the Dark-Hunter series. I rate it 3, maybe 3.5 stars tops. I should have stopped when the hero describes the heroine as smelling like patchouli and turpentine - I did not relate to artist, Sunshine at all!The premise of this paranomal series is good and I really liked Fantasy Lover, but some of the ""hip"" dialogue and repetitive adjectives in this book get a little old after awhile. Similar to Night Pleasures, this is an average story strung together by several Hot sex scenes - I do have to give the author credit for doing those well! I liked Talon, adore Acheron, and like Zarek. I know Zarek will be featured in another book and eventually Ash will have his own story, so I will probably continue reading the series to see how things play out."
5,Talon's Time to Tell His Tale-And it's great!,"Talon imo, was a very hot hero. In some books the hero comes across to me like a manequin-very handsome on the surface but without any depth or any chemistry appeal.The sparks flying off Talon and warm hearted Sunshine,the heroine, were very heated and the idea of the soulmate thing I thought was neat.I also liked the idea of sexy muscley vampire slayers roaming the night wearing ray bans and protecting the innocent as they zoom around in flashy foreign cars (In Kyrian's case) or on motorcycles (As Ash does).Plus, I like that Ms. Kenyon made her hero blond. There's enough dark haired heroes in romance to sink a ship. And there's just something sinfully delicious about a dark eyed man with golden hair, especially in the way that Ms. Kenyon creates them.I also suggest Karen Marie Moning as an author to read. Her heroes also have brawn with brains and a special kind of chemistry with their mates that make for a fun read."
2,sadly disappointed,I really enjoyed the author's other 2 books (Fantasy Lover and Night Pleasures); however I can't say that about this book.I found it hard to follow... too many other characters introduced! The quirky humor was a bit much. I will give her next book about Zarek a chance and hope that she writes another one as Kinley MacGregor
1,Less inside package than advertised - NO STARS FOR YOU!,"Was excited when these arrived. Put the closed package on my scale and saw that it weighed just 1 oz. that's curious because i'm not cooking the packaging. When emptied into the scale, I was shocked to see that there was only 3/4 of an ounce. REALLY, REALLY!! what crooks. NO STARS FOR THIS PRODUCT"
1,Beware,"I was so looking forward to these mushrooms. After I hydrated them there were dozens of little white objects, looking suspiciously like rehydrated worms, sticking out of every nook."
3,okay,"Not the greatest tasting morels, but then again, the only way to get great tasting ones is to pick them fresh. Morels are very pricey in general without picking them on your own. I can think of better things to spend $ on."
5,"Come on, come through, New York New York","In this movie, Scorsese, Liza and Robert derserves the Oscars for the best film, best actress, best song, best actor award. I got the VHS/LD but this DVD version tops it especially the extra special features - director comentary, deleted scenes etc. If only the film was launched at the right time. [...]"
2,Poor quality transfer to DVD,"I love this movie. I have owned the VHS version since the 70s when it came out, and saw the theatrical release at least 4 times. I was so excited to hear that it was being released on DVD that I pre-ordered it immediately from Amazon last year, with great expectations. The DVD finally arrived earlier this month. To my horror, the sound quality is AWFUL (muted, garbled), there are big green streaks/lines in the ""But the World Goes Round"" scene (where Liza is singing against a darkened studio with only a spotlight on her face). The title song scene is muted and of poor quality. C'mon, MGM!!! You need to re-release this. AND PLEASE RELEASE IT IN WIDESCREEN, NOT LETTERBOX!!!!! (To Amazon.com's credit, however, I have to say that with no questions asked, they have offered to send me a replacement immediately, without even having to return the original due to high cost of shipping from Canada to the US. Makes me happy to be an Amazon customer)"
3,Neither masterpiece nor disaster but something inbetween,"Considering the chaotic, often drug-fuelled circumstances of its production, New York, New York seems a lot more disciplined and successful than it has any right to be. While there's never once a sense or flavor of New York - this is pure Hollywood all the way - Scorsese's mixture of stylised settings and naturalistic drama goes beyond the traditional happy ending and takes what starts out a standard boy-meets-girl musical plotline into darker emotional territory. It may lose its way towards the and (partially due to the overlong Happy Endings number taking us away from the characters for too long), but it gets a lot more right than it gets wrong, and has a great use of color. It was also interesting to compare the theatrical version and director's cut included on the DVD - surely the easiest restoration ever since Scorsese literally cut two reels and left the rest of the film intact."
2,Beautiful photography -- dismal story,"Robert DeNiro play a self-centered womanizing abusive husband to Liza Minelli, who plays a doormat until a (literally) last-second conversion which is completely unbelievable. The songs are great, the photography outstanding. But the pain of watching this couple battle it out is not pleasant."
4,A Long Goodbye,"Robert DeNiro plays a jazz musician, Jimmy Doyle. Liza Minnelli plays a singer, Francine Evans. WWII has ended. Doyle picks her up at a party. They fall in love. They start an act together. They have a baby and their marriage starts to fall apart. Evans goes on to star in fancy Hollywood musicals. Doyle can't, and doesn't really want to make the transition, but respects his ex-wife and her new boyfriend, since he can give her something he can't. In the end, Doyle has the opportunity to leave with Evans in the mothership, but decides to stay on the ground. That pretty much sums up all two and a half hours of this film. It's the execution that makes it great.I found this movie sticking out from a shelf in the library. After I watched it, I figured it was Scorsese's way of saying goodbye to his first wife. Sometimes I have a hard time understanding what other people are going through. So, I said, ""Thanks for sharing that with me."" I'm not sure if he heard me."
2,Worth the double dip only if you crave special features,"The DVD transfer for this item is NOT enhanced for widescreen TVs, just like the previously released version. It is an excellent film, but because MGM decided to pussyfoot around giving the actual film a better transfer and enhancement, I cannot justify anyone purchasing this piece of repackaged junk. If you love special features, this would be the only reason to double dip. I prefer the pristine transfer over anything else, and was deeply disappointed. As a huge Scorsese fan, this film by far gets the worst treatment of any he has directed. Even bare-bones editions of ""The Color of Money"" and ""The Age of Innocence"" are treated with more respect."
4,A MUST HAVE DVD,"Nostalgic movie well acted (and well sung, too) in a gorgeous band era (40's) background, under a tactful Scorzese's direction."
2,Simply awful,"A terrible movie whose only interest today is that it premiered the song ""New York, New York"". Liza Minnelli was already on her downward spiral when she was cast in this-and it shows. There is no chemistry between Deniro and Minnelli here and the opening scenes when Deniro spots Minnelli with her awkward, homely looks in a crowd and immediately falls for her is absurd. There is no reason for these two to be together but the movie waddles on disastrously. This movie bombd in the theatres and it is easy to see why. The supposedly show stopping finale is on of the weakest performances of the title song you will ever see. Scorcese seems to be coasting on this one. He probably knew that he had a turkey on his hand but tried to make the best of it."
2,Poor image quality,"Had already the dvd and got the blue ray thinking that it be much better than the dvd. I was really dissapointed, the blu ray image is as poor as the dvd's."
3,Grain grain go away,"The picture quality on this blu ray is inconsistent. The nightclub scene at the beginning of the movie looks good. I thought this was a good sign even though I was not thrilled that my rear speakers were silent. However the quality took a dive when Liza belted ""But The World Goes Round"". The picture quality was so grainy it was exactly the same as on my old DVD. But all is forgiven at the end of the movie when Liza sang ""New York New York"" in startling clarity. I do not regret purchasing this but I wish they had done a better job."
1,"A big waste of time, money, and Liza's talent!!!","New York, New York hasn't aged well at all and it shows.Robert De Niro -who made a great career of always playing Robert De Niro- is a pathetic joke as Jimmy Doyle. Talk about being an overrated actor... Liza Minnelli, on the other hand overacts to the point of exhausting the viewer. However, Liza never looked so beautiful and glamorous and one wishes she had been featured in one of those glamorous, glittering MGM musicals of the golden age of the Hollywood musical. Kander and Ebb did an outstanding job -as usual- and we are grateful to them for the little gem titled ""Theme from New York, New York.""Did I like the DVD version? Nope. It ended up in the trash can, for I didn't have the heart to donate it to charity."
3,LIZA at HER MAGIC BEST,"...but unfortunately it is a bit difficult to warm up this film to due to Robert DeNiro`s unlikeable character.The interplay between Bobby and Liza are THE BEST. Unfortunately it echoes Mama`s A STAR IS BORN 1954 storylinewise. The ""HAPPY ENDING"" number is a blueprint of Judy`s ""BORN IN A TRUNK""-number. The titlesong is good, but sadly it is clear that Liza mimes the number(as are the routine), but she doesn`t open her mouth wide enough for the last note.....See it for the musical numbers if you are NOT in the mood of 3 hours of a male ""hero"" only a wolfmother would love hehehe"
5,Volume 3,"Like the reviewer T Hall I have all this series of ballet cd's and have been using them for some years for student teaching and open adult class when I have no accompanist, and I have reviewed the series at Volume 1. I want to add here that vol 3 was the first of the series I came to know and that was from a long and very informative review by the critic Paul Parish followed by a discussion among teachers on the website Ballet Talk for Dancers."
4,Good Value,There are a number of recipes I have tried and more I would like to try. I am learning a lot about the way Italians live.
4,don't stop,"Those reviewers who complaing about the second part of the book need to remember that reality is what you make of it ;)Yes, it is true that you can clearly tell where the original short story ends. But this doesn't mean that the rest of the story is bad only that it's a _different_ story. In first part the core idea remains unexplained but we get an exiting and thrilling ride from its application. In the second part Oltion explores the core idea itself. Basically it is an intelligent approach to psychic phenomenon. Oltion asks the reader to assume that it exists and proceeds to explore what could be the rules governing it, what could be the logic behind it and what whould be the consequences if a large number of people understood these principles and tried to apply them.Don't stop reading the book at the changing point between the too parts. You'll be glad that you continued when you reach the end."
2,"Starts great, limps to finish line","This book is based off a short story that was rewritten as a novella and then finally a novel. It seems obvious to me where the original idea ended and the extra stuff was added to make this novel length. It's this extra atuff that makes this book so bad though. The premise is great- a mysterious Apollo rocket launches itself monthly from Florida soon after Neil Armostrong dies. The main characters of the story investigate this and I am finding myself enjoying this book very much. I am thinking, ""Heh-heh, I have found myself a new author!"" But then the sci-fi ends and we are treated to 200 pages of crap about psychic phenomenon. I should have seen it coming- the first 100 pages were too good; I wondered ""What will happen now, all the good stuff happened?"". Because of those great early pages, I forced myself to finish the book and was very unimpressed with the results. I would steer clear of this book, there's a lot better out there."
3,"Not Oltion's best, but a good one","Oltion may not be for everyone, but he can tell a decent sci-fi story. The story here (I don't want to spoil it with too many details), can drag at times but pays off in the end. His style of writing is similar to Orson Scott Card's in that it can be unclear at times, but is always imaginative. If you're an Oltion fan you'll love this. More casual sci-fi fans might want to give it a look too."
3,Interesting,"Fantasy hasn't been ""my bag"" since I was about 14, and I've long preferred science fiction. While this is a pretty good book, there were times when it just got to be too much for me.I must admit, the characters are pretty good, and the idea is great, but the whole book just felt a little ""rushed"". It could have been another 200 pages long without sacrificing quality or readability.The blend of magic and science, while interesting, just got to be too much at times, and I found myself putting down the book for awhile to go watch ESPN.Still, I'd recommend you sit down, and give it a read. It's a fun little romp, even though it's lacking in any real major plot twists."
2,Don't waste your money.,"Either I got a bad opener or this thing is that bad. I normally don't write bad reviews, I just leave them alone, but this is awful (Bought in 2010). When it takes someone 5 minutes, standing on one foot, bending over looking to open a bottle, just get a glass of water!The appearance of this is great, but that's about it."
3,Ok strap...a few annoying aspects.,"The strap is Ok, although I found that it had very slightly rough edges that are annoying when I wear it with a collarless shirt. Also, it has slightly bulky attachment points. I do like the range of adjustment it offers."
1,Could be a knock-off?!?,"Calvin Klein men's fragrances traditionally have strong, defined scents that last all day. I'm not convinced the bottle I received is an original CK product. You could bathe in the contents and the smell disappears quickly which may not be a bad thing since it smells like Raid. I purchased four different cologne's on one order and the others were all fine. It annoys me somewhat that Amazon won't accept a return because the product is ""considered flammable"" yet I notice they have no problem selling it or shipping it out. This product is no longer sold in department stores so it might be wise to check chains like Sephora before ordering online."
3,Not the Real Truth,"I have been wearing Truth for over ten years and the bottle that came in mail, while close, is not the scent I know. I realize after a perfume has been on the market a while, it is carried over to other companies to manufacture.It's okay but I must admit I am disappointed."
2,$30 is too much for not much,"I must admit that the armband looks great in pix, but that's about it. Too bad Apple is making inferior accessories. The neoprane is fairly stiff and the velcro isn't nearly as functional as it should be."
2,If you use a silicone case beware....,"This armband is average, at best. Dont get me wrong, it serves its purpose but my major complaint is that it won't work well with the silicone cases that most people use. If you use a silicone case you either have to take it out of the case everytime you want to use the armband or try to jam it in the tiny opening that was obviously only designed to be used with a ""naked"" ipod. The realy laughable thing is that with all the scratching complaints with the nano apple recommends using a case, do they expect users to take the unit out of the case everytime they want to use an armband. Let me tell you this is a major pain!! I got this item as a gift otherwise I probably would have bought a silicone case that doubles as an armband (ie. has a slot in the back for a strap). BTW the NANO rocks!!"
1,"Horrible, horrible, horrible","I adore my nano, but this armband is one of the worst products I have ever bought. I work out quite a bit with the nano and the band comes off multiple times during my workout. The spacing of the velcro dots means I never get exactly the right fit and the band gets ripped off anytime I do weight lifting close to my body. It is also as other reviewers mentioned hugely overpriced for what it is. I am ordering a band from a different company and this will go straight to the garbage."
2,Looks good....... but,I purchased this armband to hold my Nano during workouts. The band barely fits my arm and tends to slide down the arm while running or cross training. Looking for a replacement right now.
2,fleecing loyal apple buyers,"The first thing I did when opening this item was check to make sure it actually WAS an Apple product. Its REALLY cheap looking. Looks like something you'd find for [...] at a flea market or in the ""stocking stuffers"" section of the dollar store at Christmas time. The Nano is small so almost anything will hold it, including a rubber band and an envelope which is about as good as this unit.This looks more like the freebie armband that should come free with the unit. Certainly not a [...] accessory. It just cheapens the Apple image.If OEM Apple products are your thing, then go ahead and try this. But if you're looking for something as sweet as your nano that stays put while you workout, look for something else. I'm returning mine this weekend to spend my money elsewhere."
4,sporty nano helper for active folk,"A great colorful way to enjoy your nano while joggging/running or plain working out in the gym.Gives easy access to the ipod controls.Velcro provides for easy wear and removal.Sturdily built, vibrant and stylish color. Apple way of displaying nano to the world. Branded with ipod on the side."
1,Highly Disappointed!!,"I'm highly disappointed with this product! First of all it's a tiiiiiiight squeeze. I literally thought I was going to rip the armband trying to get my nano into it! Second, the nano doesn't even fit in it all the way!! If I put the nano all the way in, the screen/dial placement is off...if I line it up with the windows for the screen/dial then I can't secure the flap once I put the Nike+ attachment on. There is no way to access the 'hold' bar at all. There is no place for the cord to your earphones. The strap has velcro dots, that are spaced pretty far apart, instead of a strip, so its difficult to find a comfy spot. Don't waste your money! I can't believe Apple came out with such a horrible product!!"
3,"It's ok, just an armband","I was glad that an ipod accessory for the ipod nano had finally come out. The armband has a tight-fitting sleeve for the ipod that allows you to user the scroll wheel while the ipod is in the armband. Unfortunately, there isn't anything to cover the screen... The armband has multiple velcro circles so you can make it as small or large as you want. But be careful, I didn't get the velcro lined up exactly and it ended up scraping up my arm. One other issue that I have with the armband is that you can't charge the ipod while it is still in the armband. It's not a huge deal, but it is sort of a hassle that you have to unplug the earbuds, take the ipod out of the sleeve, charge the ipod, slip it back into the sleeve than then replace in the earbuds. I do like that the armband stays tight even if you sweat in it. Just a note-the armband is neon green. It looks more muted in the picture online than it is in person."
3,Pricey,"The armband serves it purpose well, I use it for running and at the gym, however I find it a little bit expensive, and the color availability is limited. I have a black iPod nando, ando got the gray armband, but it looks almost white; a daker color would have been nicer."
4,Love it,"I found this on clearance at another retailer (I guess not everyone likes pink), and it's fabulous. I thought it might be just for skinny-armed people, but not so! I've got plenty of room, it fits great, and it doesn't move. Still looking for a solution to keep the earbud cord out of the way, though. Makes mowing the lawn WAY more fun."
1,Nano would not fit in the armband,"The pocket for the Nano measured 1.5"" by 2.5"" and a Nano actually measures 2"" by 3""!"
5,Long awaited,"A classic finally come to DVD. I have long waited for these release. Great it comes with spanish audio too, but I really dont understand why those other languages are in Mono only. The 5.1 sound quality is not really great, image quality is acceptable."
5,Release Date Rumor,"Unsubstantiated, but I just heard that this is due to be released just before Hallowe'en 2007."
1,The company cheated me!!! I will never buy from them again!!!,I am never buying from them again. The company videotaped the original and photocopied the sticker on the front of the tape. Do not buy from these guys. I found out when the recording suddenly stopped during the middle of the film and after that was white snow.
4,Classic Twilight Zone stories,If you like the old Twilight Zone TV stories you will love Twilight Zone The Movie. This is a collection of some of their best stories redone on better sets to a higher standard.
4,Twighlight Zone- The Movie (1983),"This should've been a movie series of at least 3 parts, but budgetary limits may have stood against the possibility. This film should've been great as a Part 1, preceeding 2 more sequels, where the very best Twighlight Zone episodes should've been re-enacted. Still I will give this film, 4 stars.The review of this film by Amazon.com should've included that it was narrated by Burgess Meredith,substituting for Rod Serling, already gone, when this movie was filmed. Meredith a brilliant actor was also a veteran of some of the original late 50's and early 60's TV episodes."
2,Disapointment,"I was happy tu buy it, after maybe 15 years without seen it. But what a disapointment! No gore, bad script. The only good story is the one with John Lightgow, the rest, very ordinary. Old people who want to stay old, a young boy a little bit crazy, a guy who doesn't like any race,not so good."
2,Sad tribute to an iconic series,"Stale, goofy remakes of classic episodes. Highlights: Vic Morrow and John Lithgow performances. Worthwhile if you really have time to kill."
5,lpcb,"I think that this was a cleaver movie because it had 4 differendt shows in it, I espeacally liked the last 2 shows....-Casey"
1,Twilight Zone: The Movie,"Twilight Zone: The Movie was a great disappointment to me. Having waited so long for the DVD, I finally got to watch it only to find a huge chunk missing from segment #1. This segment is testament to Vic Morrow's final performance, one which he gave up his life for. The least the DVD producer could have done is to show the movie in its entirety. This would be the best tribute to a fine actor/director dedicated to his craft. The stories for all segments does not intrigue but baffle the audience. Production value also receives a minus. Directors instead of actors take centre stage, the trailer and credits gave the directors more prominence than the actors or the storyline. If not for Vic Morrow, I would not have bothered to watch this movie. While the TV series had its own merits the movie certainly does not and to make money off a dead man is really offensive."
3,WEAK TRANSFER,"The stories stand on their own, however, the HD part of it is weak at best. I wouldn't recommend it at retail price---- I got it on sale, so it's a little bit ok."
2,Unimaginative . . .,This movie is a dismal attempt to recapture the classic tv series. Nothing new. Acting and script are mediocre.
4,4 stories into 4 sentences.,"Story one.One day you'll get yours.Story 2.Old people can still party!Story 3.Like a acid trip into cartoon land.Story 4.There's... something on the WING!Yup... I watched a few Zone episdoes and i loved every single one of them. My favorite one would have to be the episode with the STOP WATCH. ;)anyways good movie. interesting stories. Needed a better intro. And by that mean change the actor that plays the driver. Annoying curley headed guy.Im just saying...just throwing this out there...but if they were to remake the Twilight Zone episodes and put them into a movie like this... I think we would be scared honestly...on my TO DO LIST! ""REMAKE A TWILIGHT ZONE EPISODE."""
3,"OK, but The Tragedy Kept Me From Totally Enjoying it!","It was a good movie but not the best, I think the tragedy of what happened to Vic Morrow and the two child actors has kept me from totally enjoying the movie and liking the story that Vic Morrow was in! The stories I liked were the little boy with the power to make things happen by just thinking it, the story with the gremlin on the Airplane and the story in the nursing home."
4,Want to see something really scary?,"Two men traveling on the dark road open the scenario to this episodic flick. They are without audio ""entertainment"", and must improvise with trivia television theme song imitating. Funny intro to amusing tale of four previously done Twilight Zone television episodes, and may, or may not please the devout fans of Rod Serling series. This movie takes elaborate liberties, but it takes the general premises and makes it their own ironic scary fable. My favorite was the boy with unschooled magical powers in need of the teacher he found by chance in smalltown cafe. The second is John Lithgow's extreme give it his all paranoic performance in the final episode. One note to anyone who does not like this movie, it's an iconic gem whether you like it or not."
4,"Four tales, great actors and great acting","This movie features four classic stories from the Twilight Zone recreated for the big screen. There are several cameos in each story and a big leading star in each tale. The first story is of a man tired of the racial diversity in the US, where he then finds himself leading the life of a Jewish man in Nazi Germany, a black man caught in the KKK tribe and another. The second is a good story of a retirement home that finds youth in its heart after becoming children again and finding that it is not worth staying young. The third is a twist on the original tale of a boy who's wishes come true as an unknowing women looking for adventure was lured in by the child. The final story is of the Gremlin on the wing of a plane as John Lithgow plays the sole man who sees the monster ripping up the plane. With this performance you can put John Lithgow in an empty room with a window and it would still be just as terrifying from the way he conveys what is out there."
4,Tribute Classic,"OK, there are some flaws in this movie but overall it can only be considered a modern classic. From the aged nursing home to the racial biggot sequence suspense reigns giving pure entertainment. Why this has not been transferred to DVD is beyond comprehension. As a cinema movie it is one i have never forgotten, the type of movie that remains embedded for twilight zone lovers. You can imagine my disappointment when continually searching for it on DVD. My fingers remain crossed !"
5,Blast from the past,Watched as a family and was as entertained as I was the first time I saw it in the 80's.
3,itsok,its okit was a bit of a disappointmentsad that mr morrow lost his life during filmingthe film was a bit disappointing
3,Twilight Zone review,"The movie tries to capture the masterpiece of Rod Sterling TV show of the same name. The result is a bit of a mix bag. There are 5 stories, but it's the opening and closing story that steals the show for me. The main draw back is that there is very little narration between each act. The genius of the TV show is that through Sterling's narration he was able to convince you to suspend you disbelief no matter how cheesy or hokey the stories got.Each story recreates a classic episode and in each case I just keep saying I'd rather be watching the TV show with the exception of the final act.The final act is Nightmare at 20,000 feet and you have a tremendous performance by John Lithgow. The scene is shot great, the build up is outstanding, it scary, it surpasses the original show and it has a nice twist ending.My final verdict is try to go into this movie with an open mind and maybe you will enjoy it more than me."
2,Very Disappointing.,"It is not a movie, but a remake of 4 episodes. What were ""classics"" in their original form, are now under performing and obsolete. Not to fault the cast, they did a good job. It just did not work at all."
3,Twilight Zone - The Movie,"The video arrived promptly and the price was good; however, the DVD case was cracked and broken even though there was no damage to the packaging - how does that happen?"
3,Vic Morrow fan disappointed with Twilight Zone,I have seen Twilight Zone several times and I will be quite honest and say it's interesting but being a Vic Morrow fan I hated to see his brilliant life come to such a gruesome end i can't bear to watch his story in the movie knowing he died for it but the rest of the movie is okay.
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A misbegotten film that has nothing to offer fans of the show, neophytes, or anyone else, The Twilight Zone movie is poorly made and only worth watching for TZ fans who have to see it so they can say they hate it for themselves."
1,Morrow died for this?,I first saw this film as a young teen at the theater. I really enjoyed it at the time. Several years ago I began to read up on film history including two books on the Twilight Zone accident that took the lives of three actors. It was with trepidation that I watched this film again recently. What was I thinking? Creepshow stood the test of time with tighter vignettes and better actors.
5,Intense..,"S.L. did a fine redition of payback in the old West...Henry Fonda & his blue eyes gave the bad guy a simple coldness to his part. You cannot beat Charles Bronson pre payback ""Death Wish"" series. In Lakkewood, Colorado"
4,Once Upon a Time there was Sergio Leone,"As a huge Leone fan and a fan of the classic western, I was not disappointed by Once Upon a Time in the West. The stellar cast, humorous storyline, signature musical score and beautiful backdrop provide all the classic Leone we can handle to this shoot-em-up outlaw film. Harmonica and Cheyenne are the consumate outlaws we hate to love.Instead of the good, the bad and the ugly, you get the lone wolf seeking revenge (Bronson), the gone bad but good at heart (Robards)and the very beautiful in Cardinale.I highly recommend it to anyone who loves ""spaghetti westerns"" and, who like me, secretly wishes she could be a cowboy."
4,Spaghetti Retro,Leone's masterpiece is well worth a viewing not only to see a classic piece of western lore of good versus evil but also to be transported to a time when analysis of the need to fight the corruption bred by wealth and power was an acceptable plot line. It was striking to see this from the perspective of post 9-11 America. Movie buffs will enjoy the movie as cinema and the additional disc is chock full of goodies. For all this package offered this was a great buy and all of these factors helped make my viewing of Once Upon a Time in the West a truly wonderful experiecne.
5,Epic Masterpiece.,"Awe-inspiring, thrilling, interesting film about the developement of the railroads in the west, and three men entangled in the affairs of one woman. Of all of Leone's great great westerns, this is the ""other one."" In scope, quality, story and effect it only stands with The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. I highly recommend it, and like it even more than The Good, The Bad....Henry Fonda is a badass here, Charles Bronson, still cool and quiet, Jason Robards gruff and funny and Claudia Cardinale very sexy and grounded."
4,An interesting take for a classic western,"Wow! This is not your ""run of the mill"" western by any means but I will say this, ""Sergio Leone is a heck of a director!"" Some the the scene set ups in this movie are really powerful. I LOVE how certain scenes were presented to the viewer. The cinematography is very impressive as well. You really need to pay attention or this one can get away from you. Claudia Cardinale is gorgeous, Henry Fonda is the worst of villians, Charles Bronson is at his ""tough as nails"" best and Jason Robards is an understated but powerful character in the mix. Sprinkle in a little greed, lust and gun play, stir well and enjoy. This one is a keeper!"
3,More like a painting...,"This movie is extremely good looking, filled with beautiful landscapes and beautiful shots. But in my opinion as a movie it failed miserably with far too many long drawn out scenes. The movie felt incrediably sloooow... After seeing the special edition of ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" I had to see this film since some have refered to this being Sergio Leone's better work. After watching it I strongly disagree. Both movies are long yet ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" never seemed to get bogged down. The cast Jason Robards, Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson just do not compare to Eli Wallach, Lee Van Cleef or Clint Eastwood. THE HARMONICA! Like many things in this film is overdone and ends up becoming ANNOYING. This film is over directed. What a disapointment after seeing Sergio Leone's real masterpiece ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly"""
2,BORING - EXTREMELY SLOW,A previous reviewer said best western ever. NO WAY. It has the star power but EXTREMELY SLOW going and way too many cliches. Waste of the star power!
1,disappointing movie,This movie was so disappointing to me that I did not watch it through to the end. I wish you had the movie back and I had my money back !!!
2,My ears!,I hate this movie. The awful sound effects and music made it unbearable. On top of that it didn't have a good story. The acting was alright. I'm also a fan of the man with no name trilogy.
1,once upon a time in the west ?,"not a good movie at all, slow and boringwouldn't recommend this movie to anyone at6 all. They justkeep dragging it out"
1,Spaghetti western,"I purchased this movie by mistake because I failed to recognize it. I had watched the beginning before, but soon abandoned it. I thoroughly dislike Italian westerns made in Spain, especially by Sergio Leone. Spain is not the American west, which is an interest in itself. The trains are European design and are badly phonied-up in a paltry attempt to make them look like 19th century American ttrains, as though no one would notice. Any substantrial buildings are nothing like what would be found in the U.S.A. Those westerns fall short because they fall apart."
3,Uncut? I don't think so,"This ""claims"" to be the original uncut version yet there is still at least one missing scene and the way the cuts look there appear to be many more missing. *SPOILER* The scene where Henry Fonda shoots the young boy is completely cut. In the original that pitcher the boy was holding exploded after the gunshot. The movie is still excellent with the greatest opening scene ever in a Western."
5,My recent purchases,Everything that I purchase I really like or I would not have spent my hard earned money on them. I liked to be entertained and I feel that my purchases are doing just that.
5,The daddy of all Westerns,"Definitely the best all-time western ever produced. Naturally it would be made by a European. Sergi Leone blows his excellent ""Trilogy"" series out of the water with a movie so broad in scope that to watch it a couple of times is the only way to appreciate what you have here. I'll say like John Carpenter after watching this for the first time, ""What is this?"""
5,Once Upon a Time in the West,"This is an awsome western. The ultimate Western. It's very hip, very haunting. None of the usual good guy vs bad guy stuff. No Hollywood great white hope saves the day patriotic gha gha. The characters are all very intriguing. Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson do their absolute best work here. Gabriele Ferzetti is glorious. Sergio Leone has style to spare. Filmed in 1967/68 Leone's style is still so fresh and exciting. A very cool little American tale told ever so slowly and deliberately by Leone, Bertolucci and Argento."
4,wow,"this is my fathers favorite movie, and after seeing itmyself I can see why, a very well done, interesting western, big names, great story I would have to say ""you need to see it, you will enjoy it"""
5,"This is Leone's masterpiece, the ultimate Western epic.","Sergio Leone changed the fabric of Western movies with ""A Fistful of Dollars"", ""For a Few Dollars More"", and ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"". He introduced us to something different and more powerful, he changed the pace and timing of the Western. He added grit and dirt with less distinction between good and evil. His masterpiece, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is the complete Western saga. It is, for me and many others, the best Western, and one of the best films ever made. It is truly a work of art and beauty. The casting, the characters, the music, the story, the sets, the camera work....it is all brilliantly done. It is every Western and yet it stands alone. This film is almost 40 years old, but it could have been made yesterday."
3,Ok,"Jason Robards was the best character in here. The woman should of been shot though. Tramping around with the man that murdered her family. I did not get the ending, what? was the woman longing for bronson? the next man to sucker. Was harmonica too dumb to see her tramping ways. Sadly the directors did not play more on this. Happily Robards is seemingly the smarter of the bunch at this point in the movie, however he was much too gentle with her at the end. They should of kicked her off the land and tried her for cavorting with criminals.The harmonica is WAY over done and the movie is too long. Not enough character display by Robards and or Fonda. The murdering at the beginning was apparently unjust and unbelievable. You are left feeling confused why the tramp keeps the land."
2,Don't expect anything as memorable as TGTB&TU.,"I am a huge fan of The Good The Bad and The Ugly. Once Upon A Time In The West was incredibly disappointing for me. I wondered why I'd never seen it on TV. After I saw it I knew why. It's too slow too long the motive is weak, the characters have no chemistry and unlike the TGTB&TU the dialog is unmemorable. I was equally attracted to the possibility of another fantastic score by Ennio Morricone and was equally disappointed. I was really hoping for a treasure I'd somehow missed over the years however I wasn't missing anything."
3,"Excellent movie, but ... come on!","--hardly the greatest ever. Ponderous. Too long by an hour. And, even with that length, some of it makes little sense. A truly great score lifts the picture onto a level that the rest of its components don't merit. It's a good movie, but it doesn't stand with THE WILD BUNCH et al. Get a grip, people!"
1,Dreadfully slow,The amazing cast must have been desperate for work to be in this truly awful western. I made it only about 3/4s of the way through. There are so many better movies out there.
5,Outstanding classic...,"What can be said about Once Upon a Time in the West? A classic starring many top stars of the day. The plot blends slowly to explain the conclusion with Bronson and Fonda; the atmosphere is a staple of the spaghetti western...sweaty and grimy as life would have been in such a climate (not the neat, clean pressed outfits of the great earlier hollywood westerns!). Henry Fonda plays the meanest role of any of his films in this! An absolute must see for anyone who enjoys classic westerns. Let's hope that hollywood doesn't try to remake this one...an impossibility with the current crop of namby-pamby actors existing today."
5,LOVE IT!,Saw this as a child and was mesmerized by this movie (even more so by Claudia Cardinale - WOW). Love it even more now. Not sure the younger generation would have the patience with this type of movie where the camera actually stays with one shot for more than 5 seconds but I think this is one of the best Western's ever made!
5,The defention of epic-ness!,"This is the best western of all time and the soundtrack is way up there as well but be warned if you are not able to appreciate good quality cinema and find yourself enjoying more of the mindless action shoot em up genre, this is probably not for you. It may take 2 or 3 viewings to fully appreciate this film just because there is so much to take in but once it clicks you will keep coming back just to admire the cinematography, soundtrack, dialogue, etc... Once upon a time in America is very much done in the same style as this movie but falls way short in my opinion. Once Upon A Time In The West is Sergio Leone's masterpiece and I cannot wait to own the blu-ray version of this movie. It already looks great in DVD upscaling for a movie that is well over 40 years old. There aren't too many movies that truly deserve five stars but this movie, without hesitation, is a true five star movie!"
5,"Move over ""Good, Bad and the Ugly""",This is probably one of the best Western's ever filmed. A subtle story with the true grit Western action.
4,Western of note,"This movie has stood the test of time. Gritty closeups are the hallmark.Starts slow, but gathers attention and interest. I expect this is how the West really was during the ""cowboy"" era.Highly recommended."
5,What more can be said?,"Buy this. The Special Collector's Edition has two discs, one disc with the film and the commentary audio track and the second disc with the amazing documentaries, location gallery, production gallery, cast profiles and tons of other extras.The movie is perfect, with a great cast. Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale are just some of the major stars in this production. Henry playing Frank the murderous gunslinger, Jason Robards the half-breed gunslinger, Claudia as the sexy Jill (and she is still sexy now) and Charles are the man who also has no name.The commentary gives us lots of information on the casting, soundtracks, behind-the-scene stories and lots of insight that just helps bring it all together."
5,Marvelous,"The best western in the history, in this edition, has a amazing video quality and fantastic audio.Leone has the touch. He's a genius. Henry Fonda as a villain is just outstanding. Timeless score by Ennio Morricone.And for the collector's, this edition comes with a nice slipcover.Highly recommended!"
5,Best Western,"Another movie that proved the Italians ""get"" American Westerns better than most American directors and producers. This movie is a classic. The music is also first rate."
3,'the good - the bad',"what great potential the DVD format has, a full and complete film could well have fitted nicely on a DVD, great music and all. The cuts made to the DVD are obvious, to suddenly jump from the train scene to a cave in some rocks is without meaning, a clean shaven Bronson suddenly gets a scar, why. A non-Directors cut version would be marvelous as I suspect that whoever had the scizzors in this version was not sober. The music of Morricone is wonderful. Frank Just.NZ."
3,An Italian western made in America,"Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda make a story about the coming of anevil railroad tycoon to Arizona.Part of the movie is filmed in the John Wayne country of Monument Valley.The only recognizable Italian is the leading lady, Claudia Cardinale,but the film has a Sergio Leonefeel to the filming. In such a short period of time a revolutionin Hollywood had taken place and movies with Italian extrasshot in Italy ans Spain were no longer enough.Charles Bronson is the Clint Eastwood character of the nameless man.The result is pretty much a bad imitation of an Italian western?Not that everybody didn't do their part, but the result justdoesn't have the spirit of the Eastwood films."
1,Waste of money,"I wanted to give myself some time before I reviewed this. I am confused how so many people thought this was a good movie. The more I think about it, the more totally implausible the plot is. Most of the movies I own I have enjoyed watching over and over. But I have no desire to watch this ever again. I just do not see anything redeeming or entertaining."
1,laughable juvenile fantasy that would have appealed to me if i were 7 years old.,"this is a classic movie????? if you're of that opinion i suggest you try reading some books. i've always been a book person, but am trying to give movies a try. i guess i had better go back to books. it seems like for about 2 hours of this almost 3 hour film, everyone just slowly walks around and stares at each other. i guess this is suppose to show that they are really really bad. honestly this is a childish revenge fantasy movie that's all cliche. from early on in the film, you know exactly how it's going to end, who will die, that sort of thing. like my review title says this is art created for the mentality of a 7 year old boy. my goodness this is bad bad art. laughable. good soundtrack though."
1,over rated!,"I am a big fan of spaghetti western, and I got a huge collection of them, over 300, so I can tell something about that movie: Slow and annoying movie(Charles Bronson do nothing, but play the same annoying tune the entire movie). For all those people who over rated this movie and put it among the best, just two words: COME ON..."
1,once upon a time in the west,This film is a waste of money.It is so slow you can see moss grow on the actors.It should be called Faces.If you can stand to watch the whole laborious thing.You will know every pore in the face of the major actors.I bought this Poor excuse for anything from Amazon.
4,An OK movie with Great Cinematography,"After watching this film, I found myself thinking, all that for something not much? It really is a film that is much to do about nothing.This movie excels in storytelling. It presents the story in a very exciting and thrilling manner, and the viewer is constantly trying to piece things together, and figure out who's the bad guy and who's the good guy. The viewer gets a good idea how life was in the West back then. There are some beautiful scenic shots of Western landscape and the cinematography is impeccable. The writing is also superb. I liked the characters' dialogue and the little subtleties that carry the plot forward.Enjoyable to watch, but it could have used more meat on the plot."
5,The best film ever,"Okay, so you've seen tons of movies already - forget that! This is the one to watch. We can only hope that someone decides to bring out this MASTERPIECE on DVD as soon as pos... And in it's original form. It's that good!"
5,Best Western I've ever watched,"If you like The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, you'll love this. Both have the same director, Sergio Leone."
4,A contender for the best Western ever made,"Although directed by Sergio Leone of the Dollars Trilogy/Eastwood fame, Once Upon a Time in the West has no humor in it - it's deadly serious. And many feel it's the best Western ever made. Stellar casting contributes to the success of this movie: Bronson, Fonda, Robards, Cardinale, lordy, what more can you ask for?"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Yeah it's awesome seeing Henry Fonda as a bad guy, and Charles Bronson can stare menacingly with the best of them, but the movie lacks the raw urgency of Leone's Dollar trilogy or the underrated Duck You Sucker; it's worth seeing if you like Leone but it feels really long and often turgid."
3,Maybe 3 1/2?,"I purchased the Special Collectors Edition from Amazon several years back but only got around to finally watching it this evening. (My wife was out with girl friends and I had some time to burn!). As a huge fan of the three Eastwood ""Man with No Name"" movies, I'd seen this upon the original shorten theatrical release; way back when. I didn't care for it much then and can only say a bit more these decades later. ""Artistically"" it's a very good looking film and it's got a great cast but it is just so, so slow and rarely exciting in the action sequences. I'm probably simply a low brow entertainment whore who values entertainment first and appreciates the ""art"" secondarily. Over the years I've view ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" probably 15 times but I'm reasonably certain this will be the last viewing of ""Once Upon a Time in the West."" Really over rated."
4,The Classic Spagetti Western,"Anyone who enjoys westerns, especially the early Clint Eastwood movies will want this movie in their collection. This is is the best of genre. Jack Elam's cameo performance in the opening is a real must see. The cast is great with Jason Robards and Charles Bronson turning in some of thier finest work. Henry Fonda is excellent as the heavy."
4,DVD Please,"For two years now I've been waiting for this to come out on DVD so that, on my birthday I can purchase some high-end 100% agave sipping tequila and watch this fine, fine film. Yet sadly, no DVD version yet exists (isn't this what Criterion DOES?) Honestly it makes no sense. It is widely regarded as being one of the top 5 westerns ever made, if not the very top. Please, whoever from studios reads this, get this out on DVD already!!!"
2,The Movie itself is no doubt Fantastic but no better in Picture quality compared to it's DVD,"I have a dvd of this movie but I purchased this Blu ray version expecting better Picture quality . But I'm deeplydisappointed by the no better picture quality of this blu ray compared to that of the dvd. If you already have a dvdof this movie, Never, Never buy this."
5,ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST,"It is too bad that we can't get movies like this produced any more. It has a great story with great actors & actress. The scenery is beautiful (natural) not computer generated. It has to be one of the all time greatest movies made to date. In fact, all the spaghetti westerns are great. I have them all on VHS, and slowly replacing them with DVD."
2,The absolute worst,"I like almost all music!!!!!! that being said this was the exception, the surround mapping is good but the overall quality of the music was imho very weak I was looking for a very trancy ,ambient experience, I have a hard time even classifying this as music! I have not listened to Jeros other releases but I hope they have a little more cohesiveness implemented. if your looking (as I was) for something to rock your surround system check out BT, This Binary Universe or Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon hybrid SACD!!!!!! or maybe(a big maybe) Jeros classical releases, If I could edit the stars I gave this release in hind sight it would be a - score! Seriously if you want something that will give the Surround a good work out and maybe be a new and interesting musical experiencegive this a look!This Binary Universe"
4,Blackberry storm case,"Great product, keeps phone (BB storm) snug in place. Only minor drawback is cannot be use with any skin or protective cover for the BB. Great look, great product for the price."
4,Read This Book,"I am not sure what book the previous person read, but it wasn't this one!!Not only do they give you IRS documents and forms, but explains them line by line in real peoples language. Citing court cases and explains what to do and not do to get the best out of each line and every form.File however you want, but this baby sits on my desk and is used to reference when I need to know how to get the best deduction or the legal view on a purchase, debit, sale or credit.If you run any business or household.... Get the most from the money you make. E&Y help you do it with this guide"
3,pretty for the price,"I have owned this lamp for about 3 years. It is pretty for the price. I wouldn't call the craftsmanship top quality by any means. But for what it costs, it's pretty fair. After 2 years, however the lighted base does not work any more. I purchased a new bulb, thinking that was what the problem was, but it no longer lights up. This is very disappointing because the lighted base was one of the main reasons I purchased this style. Now the base is dark when the lamp is lit, and when not lit, it is far less attractive."
2,Don't waste Money and Time,The balm doesn't asorbed in the paw pads. It gets all over when you're pet walks around. It defeats the purpose. A lttle pricey.
4,Seems ok,"I have only used this a couple times, but it seems to work ok and my dogs don't mind it/it doesn't bother them. It has a kinda nice smell also, but that's not that important"
3,Dr. Baian; A good samaritan and a gruesome killer.,"Baian, a large and bulky Japanese doctor well into his work, helps many people as well as kills them. On the side, he carries out several jobs to kill and assissinate various victims that are ordered by big bosses. Because he is a great doctor enables him to kill with precision and with much swiftness. Although he gets paid to kill these victims, he goes on an explicit journey to find out who oredered the assissinations and why are these victims chosen. In my opinion, the book needed a little bit of more action. There were some dull areas in the book. But overall, the book was an interesting mystery which is pretty good for those love solving mystery puzzles."
2,Recycled Words,"This book, ""Brave Men,"" is pretty much just a reprint of his autobiography, ""About Face."" Save your money and buy ""About Face.""Otherwise, they are both good reads, factual, and realistic, if somewhat opinionated. One caution: Col. Hackworth does not hesitate to give strong opinions in areas in which he is not qualified, such as the Sherman tank."
4,Beautifully told story,"I've read many books by this author. The last two books have been my favorites. The Man From Stone Creek is a western story that's beautifully told. You can picture the Arizona setting. Maddie is strong and vulnerable at the same time. Sam is everything you want in a hero. He's tender and caring, but he's all man. I could not put the book down. Very much worth the hardcover price, excellent read."
2,Disjointed but easy read,"This book is okay. I did not feel invested in the characters despite their continued misfortunes. I did not feel that the romance was adequately developed. There are very few instances where two main characters are engaged in conversation. However, the few scenes that do exist are engaging. Overall was disappointed in this story and the ratings found on Amazon which led me to read it."
5,Amazon purchase,I received the book very fast and it is in very good condition.The book was very good.
2,"SADLY, A WASTE OF TIME---","Just a so-so story that flitted about in too many directions and only skimmed the surface, never dipping deep enough to make it interesting. The whole thing seemed so forced and I never really warmed up to the characters (the hero started out interesting, but soon fizzled out.) Also, you had a Ranger who was supposed to be so tough yet so caring that he couldn't kill four outlaws who themselves had raped and brutally killed--including children--but let them go when they threatened his horse and then they went on to do more destruction??? There was little romance and little intimacy, all of it rushed in at the ending. Really, a poor take-off of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Kindergarten Cop."
1,LLM does it again - creates a great reading experience,"LLM not only writes a nice romance she writes a good story aswell and includes the flavor of the Old West in the process.There is mystery, intrigue, as well as romance. The charactersare well written and the reader forms an attachment to them thatenhances the story. I'm glad that LLM will be writing somestories around other characters."
4,Great shoe organizer,"I looked for a while for a shoe organizer for a small closet I had, and have been happily please with this ClosetMaid Organizer. I wear a womens size 10 shoe and I can fit all of my shoe in pairs in the cubbies, however my husbands size 14's only fit one per hole. It is a very sturdy product and incredibly easy to put together. I would definitely recommend this product."
3,too small,The cubes were too small and I bought this for my kids. I can hardly fit a pair of shoes in each cube.
3,Its OK,I brought this for my daughters shoes. It built fairly solid. Instruction are not good at all. Very small for shoes to go in. I would recommend it for a temporary solution but not a permannent solution. It is what it is...Just Fair....
4,Dangerous past,"This play is meant to show us the struggles of a family that is not certain how to deal with its past. The major questions of the play ""Will Boy Willie sell the piano?"" ""Will Lymon fit in up north?"" ""Will Avery get his loan?"" were very common concerns of people in this time period."
4,What happens when we forgive,"This play about African American family and history tells a story of a family with its ups and downs. More importantly, readers/viewers of the play will come away with a sense of what is important to many African Americans as a people, the power of forgiveness, and the importance of family unity."
3,It was good but not his best.,I feel he could have added more to the play. If this play was a meal it would be meatloaf and potatoes. See without the gravy and vegetables and maybe even dessert its not a full meal now is it?
3,"Alice Walker's ""Everyday Use?""","If you've read that famous, oft-anthologized short story, you'll get the idea of this play. The tapestry in that short story serves the same purpose as the piano in this one.I enjoyed some passages in this play, especially the ones related to the importance of ownership of land as a step toward dignity and self-determination.But - is it just me, or is August a little overrated?(P.S. - I am white.)"
2,"Some good points, but poorly written.","Albeit this book carries a nice concept, the play itself is tedious and ill-written. A short read..but nothing remarkable."
4,Great Book,"This play was mandatory reading for my Honors Rhetoric course. This literary work by August Wilson reflects the the painful past and anticipated future of the African American race. The characters performances aided greatly in relaying the theme of this play. As an avid reader of Wilson's work, I reccommend this play to all in hopes of transcending the message of Black History. Mr August Wilson in my opinion, is the world's most prolific playwright!"
2,Ho-Hum,"I think that this book had the possibility to be an amazing read, but I found it missing some very key parts, especially character development. The ending was also a let-down, it was too easy to see that it was quite shallow and happened without any obvious reason."
2,Would Not Buy This Brand Again,"Battery life and recharge time is abysmal!Cannot buy accessories for i750 on their web page!Software is Windoze only!I live in California & cannot windshield mount; should be a usable dashboard mount included in box!Another example of a good small company bought out by a corporate giant, profits first, screw the buyer!Going on EBay to look for a TomTom Go510"
4,Pretty Good Bra,"For the size that is hard to shop for, in a lower price range for people like me, this is a pretty damn good bra. the straps probably coulda been deigned a little better (they kinda roll alot), but other than that its supportive and the shape is pretty darn good."
2,Started off great,"I loved this bra when I first got it a year ago. It gave me great support, it looked great and I was the happiest with a bra that I have ever been. My girls are in the F range so it has been difficult to find the right size. A year later, the girls are headed south and the bra has no support left in it. I am really disappointed in the quality after paying almost $70 for one bra. They are on a great product if it could stand the longevity of time. One year just doesn't work for me."
1,Redesigned style not the original Dream Tisha,"For some strange reason Le Mystere decided to redesign the Dream Tisha. This is the redesigned version which has flimsy cups with no shape. So, if you are looking for the original Dream Tisha with the molded cups that keep their distinctive shape, this is not it. Shame on Le Mystere for ruining a great product. Very disappointed.Also, Amazon needs to take more care in how they ship bras. These bras arrived crushed and indented, there was nothing in there to keep the bra's shape and prevent them from getting damaged."
1,don't fix what wasn't broken,"I bought the dream tisha several years ago and fell in love, rushed to buy three more. Since my original purchase, they have changed the fit. I'm a natural 34D, with narrow/small shoulders...the straps are now too long on this bra and even at the smallest adjustment, there is no lift, ""the girls"" merely rest in the cups. I even went to be resized, to make sure I had not changed, it was not me, it's the bra. I'm very disappointed as this was a fantastic bra that gave lift and minimized at the same time, now I have to search for another brand."
3,Dream Tisha not as dreamy as I hoped,"Was very excited to try the dream tisha. It's not as dreamy as I hoped. I usually wear Wacoal in a 32F, when slightly thinner I usually wore Vanity Fair in a 34DD. I ordered this bra in the 32F.The good: nice wide comfortable straps, lots of support, kept going from 7AM until 11PM and 3 hook closure.The bad: band is much tighter than other brands in the same size, cups are narrower than other brands in the same size, when on the loosest setting the other 2 columns of hooks are scratchy on the back.Kept this one, as my bra situation is desperate at the moment, but would have tried the 34G if I could have waited."
1,Great comfort - Poor quality,"I absolutely loved this bra when I first put it on, but after only a couple of washings the metal underwire broke through the fabric and started poking at my underarm. I thought it was just a rare occurence, but I bought a couple more of these bras and the same thing happened everytime. They cost way too much money to only get two or three wears out of them. I am so disappointed in the quality of the underwire."
1,Dream Tisha Lace fit me perfectly. Dream Tisha didn't fit. Not made as well.,"I bought the Dream Tisha Lace, Dream Tisha, and Tisha bras. I expected them all to fit similarly, but they did not. Here is my comparison:Tisha -- 2 hooks in back. Unlike Dream Tisha lace, cups did not keep their shape for me. Fits smaller than Dream Tisha and Dream Tisha lace. Works better than Dream Tisha or Dream Tisha Lace for lower cut tops. I kept 1 of these bras for lower cut tops, but the lack of cup smoothness is a problem.Dream Tisha -- 3 hooks in the back. Straps are wider than Tisha. Cups were flimsy and creased when I wore them. Looked terrible on me. I returned this bra.Dream Tisha Lace -- 3 hooks in the back. Straps are wider than Tisha. Nice and supportive for my 36D frame. Molded cups held their shape on me. Perfect fit for me. Only problem is that the lace comes up high enough to be seen with some tops. I will buy enough to wear this bra almost all the time."
1,Deception,I have been buying this Mystère 9955 for at least 3 years now. This last purchase was low quality. Same model but material changed and the width of the straps is a lot thinner. I bought two in the same purchase and both bras were not exactly the same. VERY deciving when we think we are paying for quality!
1,no thanks,"I really really wanted to love this bra because of all of the great reviews. Although it is true that it is best to try on bras before you buy them, and get a professional fitting, I wear a 36DD in every brand that I have tried on at a store, and I own dozens of bras from various makers, but this bra is the first one that is too small for me around the band. So, I bought a bra ""extender"" but then had a second problem --I am 5'3"" and a little short-waisted and the hard sides of the bra poke me under my arms and distract me all day. It does ""lift"" tremendously well, but I don't understand why this brand doesn't size their bands accurately."
3,Overrated!,"Obviously this bra is excellent quality. As far as fit goes, I have been much more impressed with Lane Bryant bras, and they are quite a bit cheaper. This bra will last a long time, but I'm glad I didn't pay full price!"
1,dissatisfied,I was very dissatisfied with the two Le Mystere Dream Tisha bas that I recently bought. I have worn this model bra for the last five years and have been very satisfied but the wire support has already come out of one. Probably will not buy in the future. Not sure if this is typical of the construction/quality control but I will probably look at another brand.
3,Selling both current and old version of bra,"Ordered this bra twice and received the newer version and the older version. Newer version has imprinted label inside band, the old version has label tags. The older version band width does not fit true to size. Not cool. Amazon said they will look into it as it's the manufacturer sending them both. Makes it hard to know how good the bra is when I can't guarantee I'll get the correct version for fit. :( From what I can tell, Elomi brand has better fitting bras except the band likes to roll up. Le Mystere feels kinda bulky and the underwire doesn't separate the cleavage very well."
2,"Ugh, not again.","I've been desperately looking for a new bra. My go-to bra is all worn out and it needed replaced. I'm currently wearing a bra a size smaller than I should, because I cannot find one that fits. I've been fitted for a 36DDD and a 36F/G in the past. So, I thought that a 36F would be my best bet here. This is not the case. It fits so poorly, the underwire dug into my armpit and I had a severe case of ""double boob"". I guess this one will be sent back and I'll have to find another one!"
2,Doesn't fit right,"I ordered this in a 36G and a 36H. (I know I'm a 36H; I've been professionally fitted). The fitting on this bra is all wrong. The 36G was too small (""quad boob"") but the 36H was too big and gaps at the top and sides. I am short waisted and have more of the ""tear drop"" shape so I think it's just not the best style if you're shaped like that. It rides high so the wires are right there on the underarms and you can't lower the straps too much. Too bad it got lots of good reviews so I was hoping it would work.One thing about Amazon is they are wonderful and easy at returns and shipping so I highly recommend ordering thru them."
2,Toooo Small,"Allthough it was comfortable, I ordered a 34E, and It was 4 inches too small around the ribcage. Plus the cup size was too small. It fit like a 32 DD. I couldn't breath after I finally got it on."
5,GREAT,"This brand, this style is GREAT, comfortable, great fabric, great support, have several and will continue to buy more of this style"
2,Not the same as I've had for years!,"I've enjoyed this exact style bra for at least 10 years as it provided fabulous support and a smooth look under fabrics. The sizing has definitely changed resulting in the band being way too snug and the cups too small.(In the spring I ordered one of the same size worn for many years. It was way too small..in all aspects. I then ordered a size up, and it too, is too small.) The straps also do not adjust as much as my previous bras.I don't know that I will repeat this purchase which is VERY disappointing after having been such a loyal consumer for so many years."
1,Big Boulders Beware,"The manufacturer shouldn't make this bra in larger sizes. The straps are too flimsy for someone with my size (42H). No matter how many times I adjusted the straps, I still looked droopy. I returned it for something else."
2,Sizing Difficult,"I ordered two of these in different colors and had to return both. I agree w/ other comments re: sizing - One does not order whatever might be your regular size. It's good that shipping is free because of the questionable fitting. However, I can see how this bra would be comfortable once a gal has correct size. I am thinking of reordering to try different size. But in the meantime, they've lost a sale. When trying to exchange for different size, it was indicated that these HAD to be returned for REFUND ONLY, not exchange. I don't understand that reasoning since the company has lost out on an order. Seems to me they'd want to keep customer(s) by allowing exchange. That's the first time I've ever encountered the total return practice within a business."
3,Add Two and Subtract One,"These tend to run small in the band and large in the cup. So most likely you will need to go up one band size and you may need to drop one cup size. They also revised the design and the new/current ones don't seem to have the same flattering shape as the older ones did, and they are also thinner in material. My wife prefers the old style, so this is most likely the last one she'll buy. She typically wears a 38DD-40DD and 38DDD or 38F in some styles. With this bra a 38E just didn't quite feel right at all whereas a 40D might have been better - which is odd because D cups are usually too small for her. This is a tough one to recommend online, you'd be better off finding one locally and trying it on before making a mistake."
2,Runs small,"I purchased a size 44, the bra extended on reached 32 inches, either it was sized in error or these run extremely small. Seemed like a nice product but I cannot attest to how it feels on."
2,Tisha Bra,"I did not like this bra. The fabric and construction were nice, hence the two stars; however, I had to return it because it was not true to size, and the straps were enormous! Not only were they almost as wide as my shoulders, they are padded and puffy! I tried it on under a sweater, not even a T-shirt, and they popped through the fabric. If you order up in size, and don't need to wear tailored clothes, I can see the appeal of this bra. But... if you don't have the shoulder-span of a Chicago football team half-back, and actually like your clothes to fit, and your over-the-shoulder-boulder-holder to not show through, this is NOT the bra for you!"
1,Didn't Fit,Due to my breast shape this bra didn't fit well. I have a more bottom heavy conical breast shape. Unfortunately this bra is for a more fuller busted person with more upper breast than I have.
5,The Best Bra Ever!,"The Le Mystere Women's Dream Tisha Bra, has the best fit, looks great on, and is the most comfortable Bra I have experienced in resent years! From the straps staying put and not digging into my shoulders- to the right fit throughout the entire Bra,including the band and cups (I stay put in both cups from morning till night), this is truly one great fitting Bra! They do tell you the bra will feel tight and it does when you first try it on. If you think this will bother you, order up one size. I have since purchased two more, I did go up one size (one bra only) for days when I maybe puffy. If you need a comfortable Bra with a great look this bra is for you!"
3,le mystere bra,"went up a size because i read on the reviews that you should ...but that was wrong information- the bra was too big- I should have just order my size.I did return it but didnt reorder- I wanted to see what was the big deal about this bra and after seeing it, I just didnt think it was worth the price"
2,not a good fit,I have ordered this from another website and bought it in stores and it was always perfect. This one just never fit right.
2,Quality of this product has diminished,"I have been purchasing this brand/style/size for several years. The quality is no longer the same, the sizing has also changed. I have the same style and size purchased a few months ago that fits perfectly this does not fit at all. This was, I thought the best bra you could find, I no longer feel that way. Will not be keeping this purchase."
1,Horrible Padding,"Sent bra back, I was very disappointed it has sooo much padding it was terrible. Why would any company make a bra with so much padding for someone with this size."
3,It minimizes and lifts but lacks comfort,"This bra is ok. I ordered a 40DDD and I believe that is my correct size. The bra fits, but lacks comfort. The underwire molded cup design is not meant for all day wear. It looks great under t shirts though. It's difficult to find bras that fit in store. I had this bra some years ago in a too small size, but always loved the way it lifted and minimized. I wouldn't have purchased it if i would have known that it lacks comfort. Overall a good quality bra, but not comfortable. I recommend the Playtex 4049 instead. It looks great under t-shirts and is very comfortable."
5,NO MORE HUNCH BACK DAUGHTER!!!!,This bra is amazing and would be cheap at twice the price. No longer does my daughter hunch her shoulders! Gone is the constant nagging at her to stand up straight. My daughter wears an F cup and so was having all kinds of trouble. She heard about this bra from Oprah on Television. She went straight to Dillards and paid for one herself. It was so amazing that as soon as she returned from her shopping trip I got online and ordered a ballerina pink one. I hope they come in strapless cause PROM is just around the corner. Thanks again for making such a wonderful Bra... it saved many days around here!
4,Sexual Content: Rated PG-13,"Shy and quiet Tabitha Graham decides to take a cruise to live a little bit. Within a few hours of boarding, she realizes--much to her dismay--that even at sea she'll never be the life of the party. When Tabitha meets Dev Colter, she believes she has found a kindred spirit. Dev is sweet, shy, and vulnerable...or so she thinks. Dev will let her believe anything she wants, so long as he can lure Tabitha to him...This book is classic JAK (a.k.a. James)...humorous, witty, and sexy. The only complaint I have with it is that she uses too many exclaimers and the love scenes are a little purple. I wouldn't let that deter you from buying it, however. It was still an engrossing story and because it's only 219 pages, it can be devoured in a couple of hours time."
1,You sent the wrong flag,"It isn't what we ordered, but it wasn't worth the effort to exchange. If anyone actually reads this, please send the right flag!"
5,OK,"This comes with no instructions whatsoever, but it's easy to install it anyway. You just have to remove the jumper and conect the cables. You also have to find a small screw from somewhere so you can fix the drive in place in your computer.The drive comes with Nero burning software CD. The burner is fine. I only had a small problem with the sound. When I try to play any DVD with the Nero player it won't play it but it shows this message:""Due to patent license restrictions, MPEG-2 encoding/decoding/playback is not available. This feature can be added by installing the DVD-Video Plug-in""Then it gives you links to some non-existing webpages where you are supposed to find more information and buy the plug-in. Actually it links to ""xxx"", and some browsers will show you an adult site.If I play the DVD with Windows Media player, I just don't hear any sound. I had to install another player (VLC media player) to be able to hear the sound."
4,Does the job,"Great product, it was easy to install and easy to use. The Nero software is great and it is included so you can start burning CD's and DVD's immediately. Just a little note, it comes without the screws that are used to attach pieces so the drive sits correctly in the port."
4,DVD Review,At first i was surprised by its cost. but i shall say that i am totally satisfied with this DVD performance. it's quick and accept several DVD's brand for burn.
1,"compatible, not durable",this drive lasted me for about 50 discs.the good thing about it was that it wrote to every different kind of media.
2,"Good DVD, but can't play a simple DVD!","I thought this one a good purchase. It is a DVD reader, But can't play a vulgar DVD!!You have to spend additional 25$ to buy a Nero software upgrade to be able to see a vulgar 12$ DVD!Beware of this little aspect. I would not buy any other DVD reader for a PC unless I'm assured of this."
3,This is a Pokedex not a Strategy Guide!,My son was waiting all week for this and was sorely disappointed when it didn't have any of the maps and hints like the other strategy guides! You should make certain that it points this out and only buy this one if you need the PokeDex information.
2,Not a walk through!,"When I got this I thought it would be a walk through, boy was I wrong! This guide has EVERYTHING I can think of but a walk through! It does have how to use the game, all of the items you can get in the game, *extremely* detailed information on all 251 pokemon, pages on breeding pokemon, etc. Although this guide let me down because of the missing walkthrough (Earning it the 2 star rating) it is helpful, but only if you have or don't want a walk through."
4,Great Guide!,"Explained to me in a lot of detail the game, and how to overcome the emotions of a dual-layered multiplexed platform such as the one described. The analogies to post-war france are endless, providing light-hearted entertainment for all ages and sizes."
5,TWO THUMBS UP,I absolutely love this product and it too bad that you can no longer purchase it locally at a store. I have been using this product for several years now and could not be more pleased with it. Not only does it do a great job in providing a thorough but gentle cleansing it also gives the face a nice glow. I hope they never stop making this product.
4,"Good, but not for total beginners","I borrowed a bunch from the library to choose the best ones, and I found this series to be pretty decent. Having it split up in the instructional part and the routine part is a help.However, this is really not beginner material! Frankly, the recordings that are out there for beginners are either so simple that you'd get bored with them within weeks, or too hard for beginners. So I can recommend this as a supplement for those taking a beginning Yoga class for a month or two so they can practice at home."
3,ginger AZ,James Brown just didn't seem to be what he used to be. However the all star soul session really was pretty good.
1,Wrong part,"I checked three times to make sure that this was the part I needed for my car, and was assured by the web site that it would fit, so I ordered it. After waiting a couple days or so it arrived, and I started working on replacing the old one. I took off all the parts and replaced it, then proceeded to to place the other parts back on the engine. When i got to the final piece the intake plenum, it wouldnt sit right. After some checking i discovered that the EGR valve i was told was the right part for my make model and engine size was not indeed the correct fitting part. Now i cant even get the car to run."
1,dumbest ever,this movie was the worst movie ever and the book is nothing to compete. They were both pathetic. The acting was sooooo terrible that i wanted to shoot myself many times. Anikin Skywalker in Episode 2 acted better than these broadway rejects.
5,"Review of ""In Country""","I have viewed the film,""In Country,"" and have read the book by Bobbie Ann Mason on which it is based. The film is an accurate and moving adaptation of the novel. The period of the Vietnamese War comes alive on screen as it was lived by the soldiers and as it affected the families on the homefront. Bruce Willis and Emily Lloyd are agonizingly effective as two Kentuckians caught up the war. The final episode at the Viet Nam Memorial in Washington is one of the most powerful and breath-taking scenes I have ever seen in a film."
3,A true American story,"I just finished reading the novel last month. Recently, I rented the video. From the looks of it, ""In Country"" isn't a very famous film about Vietnam such as ""Born on the Fourth of July"" or ""Apocalypse Now"". This movie was made around a time when Bruce Willis was spawning his big screen career. His character, Emmet, is silent yet eccentric. He's haunted by the war. I'm surprised to find out that Emily Lloyd is from the UK. She did a good job playing a 17 yr. old Kentucky girl.Most of the time when Hollywood turns a novel into a movie, they distort it greatly. However, this is probably one of the few films that stays true to the novel as it does to America."
5,Wonderful Movie!,"This is a wonderful movie! The cinematography, acting, and script are wonderful. Bruce Willis does a wonderful job playing a different kind of part (other than action). I can't believe I had not heard of this movie before!"
4,Great movie - mediocre DVD,"I have known some fellow 'Nam vets who suffered from PTSD - I thought Bruce Willis did a great job of portraying a vet with that condition. Kudos to the other actors too.Unfortunately, the movie on the DVD is presented in the 4:3 aspect ratio, and the DVD has no special features - not even subtitles. Even so, I think the movie is worth having."
4,You just can't make this stuff up!,"Fact is truly stranger than fiction, and this history of the Islanders just proves it. Hahn and Botte go behind the newspaper accounts and tell us the ""story behind the story"" of the fabled New York Islanders. If you're looking for a history of the Isles' dynasty, this is not where you're going to find it. The authors are concerned only with the embarrassments that plagued the franchise in the 1990s.While this book may be entertaining for hockey fans in general (and I can certainly imagine Ranger fans guffawing at the Isles' problems), anyone who loves the Islanders and who suffered during the Dark Decade of the 1990s will appreciate it.I liked the book very much, but was forced to take off a star because of the poor editing."
4,Poetic mix of styles,"Cade does weave a good spell here. He's got a nice emotional baritone and the songs are mystical, spiritual, brooding. The melodies are haunting, for the most part and lyrics very intelligent (refreshing for a change). Trip-hop bits here and there, some folkish overtones, hip-hop back beats, and even some Celtic. It's great night music. very thoughtful and rich. The Bluehawk story-song is a classic -- not wuite sure what it's about, other than Native American indians and oppression, all set to a stark hip hop groove. Nice mix. Aquero is another standout, as is the first track and heaven Blue. All My Heart is a hymn, or a love song, but very laid-back and gentle. A striking first album. I'd like to see what he does with a future project. This record made me very emotional for som reason."
4,Great debut album,"Cade is very much in the way of Depeche Mode in sound and vocals; his music, though is much darker and more personally complex. More poetic. The grooves are world grooves with some hynotic electro-fied bells & whistles. The stand-out is the heart and emotion evident in the songs. It has almost a celtic, ambient feel with more edge and political posture. A totally unique debut and worth it."
4,whatever,Already had this CD from years ago. Purchased this one through Amazon.com as a gift for another person. It was shipped promptly and correctly. Thanks. Recipient really enjoying it.
5,Vacation Clock,"simple clock does the trick to countdown for vacation and was inexpensive and very easy to program, I would recommend it"
2,clamps,These replacement clamps are poor quality and difficult to set up. I would not buy them again
4,Good Replacements for Jump Start Box,"Purchased as replacement clamps for my portable jumpstarter box (originals were plastic and broke during use in cold weather). These are coated metal (one each black/red). One set of teeth on each can be removed using a screwdriver, giving access to feed the wire through the handle, and into the fastening point on the teeth and clamp it down. Other teeth are riveted in (only negative comment is that these seem to wiggle a bit, but it still looks solid). Installation was fairly easy, but you might want to use a vice to clamp the cable to the fastening points on the teeth."
5,"Enthralling, a wonderful display of Misty's talent","Besides the Free Bard series, this was one of the first of Mercedes Lackey's books I had ever read, and it got me hooked. After reading this book, I was so eager to read anything I could of her books that I went out and collected every single one of her Valdemar books. The stories are exciting, and so different from each other that you never know what to expect. From the dark, haunting stories of vampires and kidnapping, to the exciting magic of fantasy worlds, to the Grey stories, which reminded me of ""A Little Princess"", her stories will capture your imagination and keep you fascinated until the end."
2,I didn't like it,"I have read a number of Mercedes Lackey books, and have found that she is getting stale. This book of short stories were just that, short. I picked up the book because it was her. I won't do that again. The only story that was halfway decent was ""The Werehunter"". However, it didn't really feel like the story was finished. The Mage Winds series is very good, and so is the Bard series. Try those instead. These stories were written more at a junior high level. Don't bother."
3,oh it's ok,Its not one of the best of her books.......but it is interesting. Its a bundle of short stories so don't be expecting a book.They i very good short stories which i hope she's adding onto.It just wasn't what i expected though.
1,"Spanish Lessons could be subtitled ""A Year Near Denia""","Spanish Lessons is well written but not very original. It owes a lot to Peter Maile's ""A Year in the Provence"". Both books describe the trials and tribulations of building projects with the local tradesmen. Both books have a chapter dedicated to the ""guest"" who won't leave. Both describe the building projects culmunation party. The locals all share a charming peculiarity, etc. etc. Although it shares some of the same problems, ""Driving Over Lemons"" at least offers some new information."
1,Don't waste your time reading this book,"I love reading autobiographical travel books, but Derek Lambert's book is a total disappointment. I should have read the other negative reviews before picking this book up. It is not humorous, not informative, and is a complete bore. I can't imagine a book of this quality could even be published.Read Shaun Briley's ""How Not to Live Abroad"" instead for a humorous adventure in rustic Spain."
4,Moving to Spain,"Having just returned from this area of Spain, I found this book very enjoyable. It is similar to Peter Mayle's ""Year in Provence"" as far as style and content, only with a Spanish flair."
1,"1/2 a star, but I had to round up","What a weak effort on the part of Lambert. He spends most of the book telling us how he was supposed to be writing a book. Who authorized this crapola? The only reason I bought it was bc the back cover compared him to Peter Mayle. Ummmmmm, no. Not even close."
4,a refreshing anti-mayle,i disagree with one of the above reviews which opines that this is similar to mayle's provence series...perhaps the storyline is similar but the attitude is much less egotistical...lambert focuses more on the people and place than did mayle and provides a more genuine rendering of travel and of life abroad than the aforementioned franchise...granted lambert had a better country to work with :)
3,"Good writing, bad attitude","I should have enjoyed this book more. It had pace, and the book is full of witty observations and clever uses of language. I even caught myself laughing a couple of times. The one thing that kept me from liking this book more, with all due respect to Mr. Lambert's work, is the main character, which is to say the author and narrator. Frankly, the entire book is laced with a condescending attitude towards ""the natives"" that populate the village. Maybe it's the British imperialist attitude to which I cannot relate, but the narrator's treatment of some of the main ""characters"" (Angel, the gardener for one) infuriated me. That having been said, the book did paint a pretty accurate portrait of the pace of and attitude towards life in rural Spain."
3,"it is ok, solid","this is a decnt dvd. She covers a lot of basic moves and is pretty good at explaining them. The choegraphy is simple, but not too bad. Good for beginners for another viewpoint."
5,"Simple Advice, Excellent Presentation","Dangitall, someone just wrote the diet book I've always wanted to write, and he did a darned good job of it. In The Obvious Diet, Ed Victor points out that you are your own best diet designer and he inspires you to give it another shot. In these days of protein-vs.-carbs-vs.-macrobiotics and et cetera, it is refreshing to read this occasionally humorous book.Victor suggests using a food journal to identify your personal weak spots and then has a handful of general diet ideas to put into action. Most entertaining is the chapter on celebrity diet tips, which provides a real look at how individualized every person's eating is. ..."
3,Not as good as the cover suggests,"I guess anyone who's ever lost weight can now write a ""bestselling"" diet book. Yes, we all know how to lose weight - eat less - exercise more. I had thought that this would be an original, amusing take on losing weight - from a real person who was out there in the trenches - and actually lost weight.What I read was name dropping of all of the author's famous friends and Mr. Victor listing every diet under the sun and being told to pick the parts you like from each one. The book was relatively boring from the middle of the book to the end.I applaud Ed Victor for actually losing the weight and keeping it off. However, this book is not going to help the rest of us until we have enough willpower to stop eating dairy, wheat, fat and sugar (which is soooooooo hard to do)."
3,a wee bit ay editin' would've bin barry,"Nice to see the gang back, but 420 pages was entirely too long. Trainspotting's brilliance lay in it's tightness -- nothing was wasted. Here, entire chapters cruise by with little being accomplished. Welsh is a brilliant writer, and he has his moments here -- notably as he writes through his most horrific creation, Franco Begbie -- but the pace is too languid to provide the energy and brilliance of his earlier work."
5,Not Lost in Translation,"Aye, this tirs oan bonnie buk. Nae tis izzy t'rid, n'aw, cooz is writtin' ina mad Weedgie brogue -- patois, argot -- tha' dinnae ken. Ays tryn tae git tru it anna fand ays cauld gate intae it bare ih ays riddin' alout. At wirks!'Is Welsh ease oan mad buggare, ease.

Anna struktoor oaf th'thin esses fine essa bonnie bridge oar th' Clyde.Ahm imagin Welsh writtin oat this an ease larfin' alaut to hizzelf. Th' best, ahm tellin yas! Th' best!"
4,"Catching up with Rents, Begbie, Spud and Sick Boy","After far too long waiting to catch up with the gang from Trainspotting, it was well worth it. Things are changing in Leith, but for the boys their scheming, scamming and mind-altering choices haven't. We meet the lads again after they have gone their separate ways and returned full circle to each other, willingly or not. Irvine Welsh has a way of drawing you into the pub with them, so perfectly that you can almost taste the lager yourself. You find yourself hoping that this time Spud has the will power to kick his habits, Begbie the bully finally gets his, Sick Boy will settle down and Rents will avoid another toilet incident. If your not a fan of Welshs written works but enjoyed Trainspotting the movie, this is the perfect way to see what happened after they grew up... or did they?For the full effect read Glue before Porno to familiarize yourself with the smaller characters that were introduced."
5,Another shining example of Welsh's mastery,Possibly the best sequel book ever written. Welsh has and continues to amaze me with his wonderful books. I am proud to say that I have read every novel of his published in the US and will continue to do so. Each book lets the reader escape into a world apart and sucks them into the point that you nearly have to be reacclaimated to the real world when your through reading.
4,Disturbingly good,"Welsh's characters are scumbags, his language is filthy and his books are littered with disturbing violence, abusive sex and hard-core drug abuse. But you can't help but love the guy for his rattling good stories and coal-black humour. Reading Porno is like smelling one of your own farts, strangely enjoyable."
3,"Disappointing, but still worth the read","Before I go on, I should say I like Welsh's work and have bought and read most of it. ""Trainspotting"" is one of my all time favorite novels. But ""Porno"" was a bit disappointing. Mostly entertaining, but lacking the bite of his earlier work. I found the plot pretty weak, too many coincidences. The addition of the ""Glue"" characters was unnecessary, undesirable even. This could have been a fantastic book, but instead is lazy and bloated. Still worth reading though."
2,Losing it,"Irvine Welsh phoned this one in. 'Porno' is yet another bland offering from Irvine Welsh, rehashing the formula used in 'Glue' and 'Filth' and just about every other book he's written: Chapter in English, chapter in 'Scottish', chapter involving gratuitous sex, chapter involving extreme violence/murder, chapter involving rape, chapter involving...etc. No real character development, a lame attempt at a shocking 'twist'. Glad I borrowed it from a friend rather than waste my money."
2,pedantic literate grunge,"If you like pedantic literate grunge... then this is the genre for you. If you want to feel like you are close to touching a dirty subculture but not actually tarnish your hands... just turn the pages of this book and experience some vicarious sex and drugs... all in a safe, highfalutin environment where you can still feel like you are an educated and concerned member of the literati... mention it offhandedly at a cocktail party in-between the salmon pate and the boring conversation your wife is having about the latest new yorker. Yet another work where the author is seemingly a ghost writer for other's experiences... stick to Burroughs or Selby or Carroll"
3,Fonetik spelln',"It's my third Irvine Welsh so I must be finding some entertainment from him and I feel entitled to sound off about this business of phonetic spelling of dialect. Sometimes it works, in small doses,but it reduces intelligibilty and becomes irritating over over long stretches. This didn't matter so much in the earlier Welsh's because the sheer energy of the narrative and the shock of it all carried the me along. Here there's a more complex plot to be followed and the orthographic veil is obfuscating. He remains brilliantly funny and delightfully shocking at times."
1,Poor reading material,"This book was uninteresting, unlike the author's other books. I cannot recommend this book, at all."
3,Very dry.,"This book is very, very dry and somewhat outdated. There is some very useful information in here; it's great for reference. But it's nearly impossible to legitimately read any significant portion without falling asleep. Many of the processes and techniques are useful to know and understand, but are honestly not particularly important, as no one who actually works in a machine shop follows those ""correct"" procedures as they are just not practical. The book has a very ""old school"" view."
3,Hum... Good book but too old....,"Hum... Good book for beginner, but too old contents, and too many unnecessary items such as shaper and planer work, for recently technology development. Especially, it doesn't contain detail descriptions of each machining methods for practical works because of too many techniques in limited space."
3,Doesn't cover milling,"This book gives thorough coverage to metal cutting, drilling and especially lathe operations, but I was very disappointed that the book doesn't cover milling at all since that's what I bought it for. It does cover some topics that are of interest to the milling machine operator such as layout techniques, some (but not enough) applicable work holding methods and the section on the jig borer is very useful. If you are looking for lathe information, you will love this book. If you want information on using a milling machine, you should really look elsewhere even though there are some topics of use."
4,Good but dated,"Overall this is a very good book. This moderately experienced home shop machinist definitely learned from it. I have only read volume 1. The only gripe I have is that despite the copyright date the text and especially the photos are very dated. More 50's and 60's than the 1981 copyright date. That's OK for the most part, but there is no discussion any modern machinery, I think DROs got about two paragraphs. This book is definitely more detailed than Machine Shop Trade Secrets or Machine Shop Essentials and a good addition if you already have these. If you're OK with not having a book on the latest machinery and technology this is a good reference."
2,"If stardom is your goal, then skip this book","If you're seeking tips to become a commercial success in the music business, keep looking. You won't find anything like that here. If you want to read a clever, witty book that helps you cope with the pitfalls, look no further."
3,although author did her research...,"The White Witch, a historical novel brings to life the times of Charles I and the English Civil Wars of the 1640s. Elizabeth Goudge does a wonderful job with the gypsy and Puritan characters throughout the book.However, some of the plot seems rather unbelievable and unlikely.I mean, would the Parson stay at a black witch's cottage after his house is burnt to the ground, when he's friends with the white witch throughout the novel? Goudge tends to write beautiful descriptions but I found the plot suffered because of this fact. By the novel's end, I was tired of reading redundant descriptions of the same forest and flowers. More action please! The characters although plausible don't seem to speak in the language of the times and their actions often contradict who they are supposed to be. Goudge,however,did her research on the occult, healing herbs and the gypsies."
4,Great Fundamentals,"This is a good read for people in any business. Good examples of sound business principles. Concise, easy, and fun to read."
3,"interesting take, but felt like I was reading a Jr. High level book","This book does a nice job of motivating you toward your leadership aspirations, but many times I felt like I was back in Jr. High school and was listening to my teacher tell me stories of when he was growing up. With all the author's experience and interaction with such high-profile icons of this generation (and a few past), I would think he could have transferred his leadership skills in a more adult and interesting way. Overall, the book was OK."
5,great read,"I found the book to be postive ,motivating and inspiring .his insites on business and sports keep me reading till the end."
1,WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I bought this product over a year ago with the promise that RCA would be adding adaptor kits for newer cell phones, as my phone was not compatible. They have not added a single adaptor kit in the last 13 months that I have been monitoring their website. I resigned myself to buy a new cell phone so I could use this product, but guess what? All the supported phones they list are old relics that you can't even get anymore (at least in my area by Unicel and Verizon). I am out almost $200 for a product that is unusable."
1,RCA Cell Phone Docking System,"although the text states this is compatible with many other phones...contact RCA for information...it is only compatible with a limited number of phones, and I cannot get anyh response from RCA although I've e-mailed several times. I have been to merchants who offer this product and they do not have adapters for the Sanyo phones used by Sprint - who is a major player in the cell phone market."
3,Read this book to get rich quick!,"This book is about a boy named Jason. One day he loses hisallowance and uses his brother's metal detector to try tofind it. It doesn't work, but he does find a book. The bookis called ""Make Four Million Dollar$ By Next Thur$day"".He reads this book and follows all the directions. Thedirections are to do all kinds of crazy things. It is funnybecause they are things you would not expect. Does he makefour million dollars? You will have to read the book to findout.I would like to have four million dollars, but my family ismore important.I recommend you first read Stephen Manes' other book ""Be aPerfect Person in Just Three Days"" because it is containedin the storyline of this book. I only gave this book 3 starsbecause ""Be a Perfect Person..."" was funnier."
3,Corny Clean Fun,"In the worldly state of children's coming-of-age ""shock"" literature, this sweet chapter book is a refreshingly humorous tale with a little life message tacked on. Corny as Kansas, Make Four Million $, will not overwhelm you with its literary genius, but is guaranteed to evoke in a toothy grin. You can go to the bank on that one!"
5,Good quality wine glasses,These glasses are sturdy and good quality. The thickness of the class is exceptional. Good quality for the money. Happy customer.
1,not what I was looking for,"The description of this item (Libbey goblet) led me to think I was ordering a 16 oz goblet. However, this item is really a wine glass (10.5 oz). Just not what I was looking for -- and if the description was changed it might save some incorrect shipments."
3,Colts jersey not what I ordered,"The Colts jersey I ordered was not what I received. I ordered a L, received an XL. Someone had written on my order that they enclosed with the jersey, XL. It also had 2 patches on it that were not in the description...a captains patch and a super bowl patch. It was a birthday present for my daughter. It did actually fit and the company said the patches can be removed. She said they were okay on there for now. The company promised a price adjustment for my trouble which I never received."
4,An Awesome Book By Joan Haitt Harlow!!!!,Joshua's Song by Joan Hiatt Harlow was a wonderful book! Joshua's Song was about a boy named Joshua and he had to drop out of the Boston Boys' Choir to get a job to help his family. He found a job as a news paper boy. He was hiding the idea that he was a news paper boy from his mother cause he thought she would be ashamed. Joshua's Song is a historical fiction book for 5 graders and up! I would highly recommend this book!=)
4,Joshua's Song By:Blake Sapp,"Joshua's Song is a really good book to chek into. Josh is just a regular, rotten kid that tries to hep his family. Trying to find a job to keep his family alive, he runs into a few snobby kids. Now Josh is off around working for him. To find out more read Joshua's Song By:Joan Hiatt Harlow."
3,It Fizzes,"genre: historical fictionsetting: Boston, 1919artifacts: Influenza epidemic, Boston Molasses SpillIt is the inconsistency of the characterization and the uneventful outcome which makes the book ""fizz."" The flaws here are significant.Setting and artifacts are highly engrossing. The afterward is historically helpful for background.I believe boys can be snared into reading this book in a group setting. The protagonist is courageous, assertive, and takes the place of his deceased father."
3,ALEX SHERRILL'S REVIEW,"I thought this book was ""OK"" in my opinion. It had very good detail in alot of the chapters but to me it kind of went off subject. They just dragged the story on and on with no reasoning of what it was about. People who like alot of action will not have any interest in this book."
1,Poor Quality,"I totally regret purchasing this item. This can rack is poorly made and was a complete waste of money. The ""shelves"" bow down in the middle from the weight of the cans and the design itself is impractical. It's impossible to see what is on the middle or bottom shelved besides what is in front and the ""dividers"" that are included in the set and no help at all. I definitely would not recommend this product."
1,can organizer and freshness renewer,"this product has a great idea going for it. However, it's flimsy for the weight of cans and does not set up very well. There are no real directions on how to put it together and it's very hard to keep together while putting cans in. I""d return it but that would cost me more than it's worth."
1,Piece of Hud!,"Not worth the money. I bought this one because it was cheaper than the chrome one I saw but looked to be of similar quality. Goes to show, you get what you pay for. My husband had to reinforce it - very flimsy!"
2,Not what it appears,"I am not at all happy with this storage rack. It's not very sturdy and you can only put 3 'small' cans width wide.. I'm talking soup, not vegetable size cans. Also there is not enough room between shelves to easily remove the stored cans. Not happy at all with this purchase."
2,Need better instructions,"I had to get my Hubbie to help figure it out -- eventually went back to Amizon to see what it looked like -- can't get 3 shelves out of it, only 2 -- poor quality. Nice idea."
1,not very sturdy and hard to assemble,this product wasn't very sturdy and was very hard to assemble. Would not recomend to others.
2,Not worth the money spent,"I rec'd the can rack today and was immediately turned off by the flimsy structure. Placing several cans on it makes the center bow down and it does NOT hold as many cans as it claims (maybe if they were all very small cans) but certainly not your standard 15 oz veggie cans. While it's nice to have some organization to my pantry, I just don't think it's worth the money spent - next time I'll spend a few more bucks for the chrome rack that is available."
1,Disappointed,"This definately does not perform the way I had hoped it would. The wire racks are very flimsy and the weight of the cans causes the rack to lean sideways. This definately was not a good buy. The idea of the product is great, but the construction is very poor."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"These are cheap. They will NOT hold three rows of regular size vegetable cans side by side on a shelf, and there is not enough space between racks to insert or remove regular size cans using all three shelves."
2,Low Quality,"I was disappointed with the quality of the item. My mom has one from years ago and is MUCH sterdier. The one I ordered was very flimsy, and had places that had been missed in painting, and other places where the paint had been sliced up."
3,"Ok, but not as big as the description suggests","I like this product, but it doesn't really hold as many cans as the description suggests. In fact, I could only fit about 9 or 10 cans on each rack, and that is without the separators it comes with.I really need about 2 of these to make the idea work."
1,Caveat Emptor-- Read the reviews!,"Should have read the reviews. This is a piece of junk and doesn't stand up to a stiff wind. No way to keep it from collapsing, didn't even try putting cans on it. Returning product."
1,Disappointment,"First off this product is very flimsy. As another reviewer posted the weight of the cans (standard vegetable cans) causes it to sag. Furthermore, it is difficult to insert the cans between. There is not enough clearance between the shelves to adequately fit a can. It would also have been helpful to have guides between the three rows as the cans often go crooked making it difficult to insert the cans. I definitely would not recommend."
3,can rack,The product was disappointing. It will only hold all the cans if they are soup cans. To try and place cans of vegetables 3 across they won't fit.
1,Very Poor,"If you want flustration this is for you. The instructions don't explain well, and the design is poor. The parts are thin and refuse to stay together."
3,"Not bad, not great..","The item is more flimsy than I anticipated. Directions were vague. Didn't even use the dividers, couldn't really figure them out! I have to admit it isn't as bad as I anticipated (ordered without checking reviews first). So that is good."
3,Ok,This product doesn't really save that much space they do keep it organized in a way other than stacking the cans. Unless you absolutly need this don't bother.
3,Could have been a 5 star,I like the thought behind this product but the actual product itself needs some work. It says it holds 60 cans but there is now way it holds three cans in a row like the picture shows. It holds two regular sized cans and 1 mini can in a row. It's also hard to get the diameter of a regular sized can in between the front of the racks. But it did help to organize my cabinet more!
5,A REAL helper,This unit fits in my pantry space but makes many more cans accessible. I'm very pleased with the unit.
1,"""Flimsy"" would be a compliment","The thickness of the wire is not up to the job it's being asked to do. Nice design, shoddy materials. On the positive side, Get Organized issued a refund with no argument."
1,Not really very useful,"Very flimsy, doesn't hold nearly as much as it indicates, and every time you take a can out, the thing falls apart. Ended up not even using after about 5 months, and then selling it off at a garage sale."
1,Awful,The worst thing I ever bought from Amazon. So flimsy it won't hold together. The cans don't even fit so that you can pull them out. I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought this!
1,Flimsy,"Simple, flimsy, and bows with heavy cans. I was not impressed with this item. when used for canned veggies the rack is pretty tight."
1,Not What Was Expected,"When this product said it would hold 36 cans I expected to put in 36 standard cans of vegetables, fruit, etc. It doesn't hold these only 36 can of SOUP! I am very unhappy with this product."
3,Cheap is cheap,"I debated getting the more expesive can rack at amazon... but it was twice as expensive, and since I needed two, I decided to go for the cheaper system.Cheap is right.It holds the cans, but the racks are flimsy. The system isn't tall enough to really accomodate most tomato products cans, unless you remove the center shelf.This works ok for standard Campbells soup cans and small cans (pineapple, tuna fish), but larger cans (Progresso soups, the large can of Bush's baked beans) are going to cause trouble."
2,Flimsy and hard to put together,I use it but it is a very flimsy product!(probably should have returned it) I think I could have bought a better one at the dollar tree!Lowes has better storage organizers.
2,Flimsy and doesn't hold many cans,"I wish I'd read the other reviews before ordering this! This is flimsy and the instructions on putting it together were no help. The ridiculous ""dividers"" were useless; I threw them away. It doesn't hold nearly as many cans as claimed, even when you put the shelves as far apart from each other as possible. It's also hard to get the cans in and out."
2,Very low quality,"I am disappointed with this item. It was inexpensive, but of very low quality. I was very frustrated when trying to assemble the rack. There were no instructions and the shelves wouldn't stay put. Without any cans on it, it just kept popping apart. It is also not as roomy as I'd expected, but it really depends on the size of the cans that you are trying to store."
2,Pretty Sad,"I don't know about this thing. It was very annoying to assemble, and it dosent fit my cans very well. I was hoping to organize my pantry, but now I cant even find the soup! I'd say this thing is not very practical. It looks much better in the photos - don't be fooled!"
2,:- Too small to be very useful.,"This canrack doesn't hold enough cans to be very useful. It isn't helpful in keeping the pantry organized. It's a good concept,but needs have a larger capacity. I bought two of them and didn't make hardly a dent in organizing my pantry shelves."
2,"Goodbye, Good Men","An excellent book and long overdue. Some may complain it is lurid. It is lurid. The facts are lurid and disgusting, in terms not only of sexual behavior but also in terms of the heretical inclinations of too many seminaries. Michael Rose has told the truth. He deserves our thanks. I llok forward to his next book and intend to catch up on his previous works."
4,"Shocking, but is it true? And why is it so repetitive?","I knew seminaries were in trouble, but are they this bad?I am pondering the priesthood, and a friend of mine handed me this to warn me about what I might encounter. He wants me prepared to survive it. However, the vocations director of my diocese says things aren't nearly as bad as Rose portrays them, and Rose rarely uses the names of seminarians who gave him this information.Also, the book repeats a lot of stuff he mentioned earlier.Rose talks about how the vocation shortage is contrived, orthodox diocese like Atlanta and Lincoln do not have this problem, and how those in charge do little to stop the rampent heresy and homosexuality in the seminaries."
3,Shoddy Sensationalism,"Yes, there are gays in the priesthood. Yes, there are gays in some seminaries. Yes, some of them misbehave. That's not news.Unfortunately, Rose does a shoddy job of documenting the problem, and his book doesn't rise above the level of cheap sensationalism. He lets his informants rant without ever questioning their facts. He assumes that if a seminarian says he was dismissed for being ""orthodox,"" that that must indeed be the reason why he was dismissed.I've only seen one decent print review of the book, and it was in the highly conservative magazine, ""Culture Wars,"" and it took Rose to task on just this point, because the reviewer knew some of the cases himself, and because Rose had been called on it before...."
1,Anecdotes,"I am not a Catholic, and I had no ax to grind when I took up Rose's book, simply a curiosity spurred by the latest, well-publicized Church scandals. But how disappointing a book this is. Someone once said that the plural of anecdotes is not statistics, i.e., selected anecdotes don't make a case, and this book is, from beginning to end, entirely anecdotal, consisting of the recounting of unhappy experiences of disgruntled former seminarians. What they say may very well be true; I would bet that it is, but it should be clear to any reader that, depending on the seminarians Rose, or anyone else, chose, any case at all could be made. In my view, he has produced very weak evidence."
2,What about intellectual curiosity?,"I am a Catholic who does not share Rose's views. I find today's new priests to be as conservative as ever; it is usually the middle-aged and older priests who are a bit more liberal.Also, what if the point of the psychological exams and other questions posed to prospective seminarians is not to determine whether they are liberal or conservative, or whether they are ""orthodox"" or not. Maybe the seminaries seek out ""progressive"" students who will be challenged by the Church's traditionally conservative positions on such issues as abortion, women priests, birth control and homsexuality? Couldn't the point of the questions be to pick out intellectually curious students who are capable of critical thinkging rather than to fill the seminary with students who already agree with 100% of the Magisterium before having even entered the seminary?"
1,Crazy People,"I am not a Catholic or a Christian. I read this book, among others, to try to understand why the Catholic Church is self-desructing. Now I can understand why. Everyone in the book is crazy. The liberal theologians who the author claims now run the seminaries are crazy. The orthodox priests the author is defending are crazy. No one, especially the author, seems to realize that the weird activity in which these various groups of people are engaged is masking the fact that they have completely forgotten what the search for the Divine is all about. Their only interest seems to be in form, not substance. They go through the motions, say the magic words, turn the crank, and out pops God! They have made it so easy! And so completely empty and meaningless. I hope God isn't as rigid, uninspired, and brain dead as these people seem to be."
1,Where were the editors?,"Michael Rose's editors need to call him in for a little exercise in accountability. The ""facts"" here are about as dependable as an Arthur Andersen audit. Even the conservative Catholic press has noticed the lack of journalistic integrity. Not that they disagree with his viewpoint or his conclusions, just that they are not based in the ""reality"" presented in this book. The truth will set us free, so let's have some truth, not grinding of axes or belaboring of agendas."
1,"No depth, no substance","This book does a great disservice to any real dialogue or discussion about the crisis in leadership the Catholic church is facing. It is ultimately a hateful book more interested in creating bogeymen then facing painful issues of hierocracy and faith.For a well balanced examination of this subject and others facing the Catholic church please read Garry Wills ""Papal Sin"". Rather than blaming liberals and gays let us look deeply at a church and a leadership that has often been steadfastly unwilling to be honest about much of its history and its doctrine."
1,It's not that simple!,"While I appreciate that the Catholic Church has problems with its process for selecting men into the seminary I do not agree, and Rose does nothing to convice me, that the problem would all go away if only everyone went back to 'orthodox' teaching. Celibacy is orthodox teaching and herein lies the problem. As long as men are denied healthy and life giving relationships with wife partners then they are going to be emotionally crippled and seek all kinds of bizarre 'sustitute' relationships. As the news coming out of Boston indicates, the abuse is ALSO against women with straight priests getting into secret relationships and having serial or long term relationships with women. Note the Boston priest who left his female lover and mother of two of his children to die. Rose does not address this heterosexual problem at all."
1,Unfortunately not the whole truth,"Someone described this book as lurid - it is. In fact it is quite disgusting in parts to read about so many strange relationships that priests get involved in. However, Rose is not addressing the whole issue here. There are as many heterosexual priests who engage in relationships with women, and some even have children with them. Is this a better situation? I don't think so, but Rose does not mention this. These heterosexual relationships are also 'secret' and frequently abusive. The problem for the Catholic Church is celibacy, not liberals. Rose wants to put across his own agenda, and he does, but he does not want to address the whole truth. No mention is made of the damage to the priesthood by the abuse of women by many priests who cut and run when the going gets tough. Rose and others like him who still want to contain the entire truth will ultimately do more damage than good."
5,It's the only explanation that makes any sense !,"I really don't know what to write here. This book has left me stunned and angry beyond words. But I would still recommend it to anyone (Catholic and non-Catholic alike). All the babbling heads in the media (Dan Blather et. al.) continue to misrepresent what is really behind the headlines, so I'm thankful that Mr. Rose had the courage to write this infuriating book that has the ring of truth on every page..... At first, I was reluctant to give her this book, but I've changed my mind. Thanks to Mr. Rose, I have the means to show her that the scandals she's been hearing about have nothing to do with Catholicism itself, but with disobedience, and self-indulgence. (Sound familiar? Try re-reading Genesis.)Many thanks to Mr. Rose! He's done what many Bishops are even now afraid to do - see the corruption, and call evil by it's name."
3,Its not that easy ...,"""3M"" Inc. known for it's high standards ,and it's true. I have nothing bad to say about quality ,but it was not that easy to put it on windows frames. That's all folks;)"
5,the Firekeeper,"An excellent, well writtten and informative book.Could not put it down untill finished"
2,Nice but not great!,"Thought that the peridot would be darker or brighter and was surprised at the band that looked like an eternity ring. The large stone looks more yellow than green. But as time goes on, I find that it looks great with all my yellow tops."
3,Too light weight for my taste,I am just learning to play slide so I am no expert by any means. I liked the idea of being able to switch between slide and chords by just turning the slide around but I prefer something with more bulk for slide purposes. The thing works just fine but is a fairly thin walled metal. I have fairly small fingers and I got a medium when I should have gotten a small. I will probabay go back to a ceramic or bottle slide.
5,Wonderful Ballet Class Music,"This is a wonderful set of ballet music by Rudy Apffel. He has accompanied ballet classes for many years (I was lucky enough to have Rudy play for classes I took years ago) and understands the musical needs of a ballet class. But more importantly, he picks inspirational music, played with such feeling, that it helps the best dancer in me come out. The music for barre has a meditative quality that allows a dancer to focus on technique, find center, express artistry and relax."
5,Searching for Angela Shelton?,"Pre-activist as ambitious actress. While the documentary that made her famous is incredibly sexy (and funny) by itself, no Angela fan should be without a copy of this movie, which features a young and lean and topless Angela as a drug addicted prostitute involved with a young lawyer played by Dana Ashbrook, who also played, of course, Bobby Briggs in Twin Peaks. Invaluable."
1,Replaced 5 times in 2 yrs,"Technical support is (or was ) the best feature of this all in one printer, and UPS delivery. I also purchased a two year extended warranty at Staples where I purchased it and it expired right before the last breakdown I've had with it. If you have technical support help you get it online and operating, it's great and very useful, but once disconnected from the computer, you have to get with technical support to get if functioning properly again. I thought I was paying for a good piece of equipment, not technical support."
1,Save your money!!!,"Before I get into the details on how this thing stole my money, let me just say that I unplugged it, set it out by the dumpster for anyone desperate enough to take it, and reconnected my outdated, mediocre machine that this 'gem' was going to replace.Black ink smudges, the machine doesn't know what to do with photo paper, the scanner is a joke, the fax doesn't transmit well (many errors, all the time), and even the simplest copies aren't clear. There were CONSTANT printer connection problems, and while I'm not an IT professional, I can certainly run my home computers and printers/faxes/etc...I was so hopeful when I purchased it, and I didn't even have a 'honeymoon' period. It began acting up right away. Save yourself the grief, save yourself the money... buy another brand!"
4,Stable Shoes,These do promote a more stable stride especially on slick surfaces. I only buy Propet for walking shoes. They are quality made. My only disappointment was the sizing. They run wider in the heel and toe than other shoes I've purchased from them in the same size.
3,Uncomfortable!,"I have really bad knees and was looking for something that offered stability and cushioning when walking. I usually buy inexpensive sneakers like DR Scholl's brand every few months, but thought I'd go for something more expensive for a change expecting it to be longer lasting and to offer more cushioning. Wrong! These were almost like walking with a wooden board tied to the bottom of my foot. They were unyielding and stiff and offered no cushioning. At first I thought it was just cuz they were new and needed to be broken in ... but after wearing them 5 days a week to work (8 - 10 hrs per day) for 2 weeks, I am seeing that they are still just as stiff and uncomfortable as the 1st day. They made my feet hurt just walking a few hundred feet and thus made my knees hurt worse than normal. They may help others with different problems but for ortho-arthritic knees, they are not a good choice! I won't buy this brand ever again."
4,Nice shoe,The shoe seems to be a quality shoe but I bought it too wide. My fault but I needed shoes so didn't send them back.
5,Just Ordered,I just ordered these today but did not hesitate with this purchase as I have ordered this brand of shoes through Amazon before. The fit is true to size. I love that they are available in wider widths and I can wear them all day long without my feet hurting. I will wear these after work and on weekends but the others I purchased were for work and I wear them frequently because they are so comfortable.
2,Slow Breaking In,"I have purchased Propet for about 15 years. Recently the brand changed styles, these are not nearly as comfortable as the Propet's I was wearing about 4 years ago. I am having a hard time breaking these in. I work on my feet all day, and so far I can't wear these a full day yet. I think I will have to buy some other brand. They are very stiff."
2,Was hopeful these would be high quality,"I owned a pair of Propet walkers about 15 years ago & loved them! I thought these might be of the same quality (they appear to be) but actually, are NOT. They are cheap & squeaky & made of a strange plastic material that stinks. The squeaking is so bad I dare not wear them outside or people would STARE. I use them on my treadmill & I hope they will wear out fast."
1,Uncomfortable,"I looked at the number of good reviews without reading any of them, my fault. I wore them to work for 5 days. My back, hip, legs and feet were so sore I could barely walk by the time I got home from work. The right shoe rubbed my little toe to a blister. I ended up getting myself a different brand of new shoes, which I put on right away without any problem. This new pair of Propet's is going to Goodwill. Will never buy another pair again."
5,STABILITY is the word!,"I have very narrow feet, as well as bone structure misalignment in my legs. Although I have custom orthotics, these shoes DO make a difference!Not only is the sole designed for stability, but the higher top provides good ankle support as well.Most shoes for people with foot issues only come in medium and wide widths. Not only do these come in narrow, but they are a very good value."
4,Most comfortable shoe ever,These are the most comfortable shoes for work ever. I gave it four stars because the color was a little off from description other than that the shoes ae great.
2,Propet Women's Stability Walker,"I had to return the shoes. Even though I ordered a D width it was still too narrow for my feet. The shoe appeared to be of good quality, but because I have very difficult feet to fit it's better if I go to a store to try shoes on before purchasing."
1,Color,I ordered these shoes for work as a nurse. They are not white as the picture shows but sports white or as I discovered tan. They look very comfortable so I am very disappointed that I have to send them back.
2,Not good,"I am so far pleased with this product. It appears durable and all that was advertised. It comes with a 1000 mile sole guarantee. That was my original opinion of the product when it arrived. The shoes are falling apart after 3 months, of light everyday wear. The stitching on the right toe area has come undone, and the tread is worn down on the bottom. Sorry I purchased them."
2,Sizing Too Large,"Returned this pair. Sizing was way too big. The width was wide, but the length felt 1 size over."
4,porpet shoe,"Haven't use these yet, but tried them on, feel like a good fit...owe a pair of these a few year ago..they were good for long walks, and comfortble. Long lasting."
4,Liekable and melodius,"As usual, Andrea Corr does not cause a disappointment. It is a very likeable and melodious album. The songs have various style and mood, it is a very pleasant listening. It can be recommended to all fans of the Corrs, and its leading voice, Andrea."
4,Ten Feet High,"I bought this album knowing that it was going to be completely different than what she has done with her siblings. If you are buying this or if you bought this thinking it was going to be the same Corrs style, you have been misinformed. I disagree with the critics...I love this album. Andrea, once again, has proven herself very talented."
