3,what once was is now,"This band ROCKS!!! If you can, buy it. If you get the chance to see them live, DO SO!!! I have seen them with Ike and Napoleon Murphy Brock and the shows are exelent. This c/d is a good representation of thier work and a should have for any serious Zappa fan. CRANK SOME FRANK!!!!p/s. The review should read 5 stars. I don't know why it listed as 3."
3,NOT BAD AT ALL,REally good game for the most part - the graphics weren't quite up to par I thought but not too bad. The movement can be a bit stilted but easy to get through. Good puzzles and story line. Not bad at all.
3,concerned parent,"I do not own this game and only have limited knowledge about it, but I can say that my 8 year old played it for several hours at the grandparents house and has refused to sleep alone for two nights now. She hasn't specifically said what was scary about the game, but I could tell she was scared by it when I went to pick her up. I came on this site to see what the age rating was on this game and was surprised to see 6 and up. I just wanted to warn other parents that maybe the rating should be for older children. Our child hasn't had an episode like this in 4 years!"
3,"great graphics,decent plot","i thought the graphics were great.As far as the plot it is not the best game but still very good.The room on the second floor by the stairs where i heard voices was so tempting to enter.I wish i could have actually gotten inside that room.What is surprising most of all is that there was nothing hidden behind a mounted deerhead.I thought for sure that there would be a hidden chamber behind a mounted sword,moosehead,deerhead.etc.Several rooms i could never enter.I rate the game a 3 but probably at least a 4 if i could have entered every room.Overall a good game."
4,Sentra Mirror,The mirror was in new condition and packaged very nicely. It arrived on time but they sent me the wrong side. I order the right passenger side mirror and received the left drive side. Sending it back was not worth the headache so I sold it.
5,Fosse for adults,"If you've read all 37 reviews so far, I guess you're a Fosse fan. You will know who's in the DVD and what numbers they do, but I think it will be the most helpful here to say what not to expect. Except for nostalgic short appearances by Reinking, (way past her brilliant prime) and embarrassing interferences by Vereen, there are no original cast performers. Don't yearn for something you may have seen on Broadway years ago or even this show when it was fresher and live on stage.What you will see is Fosse's work done better than even he could do it. These are professionals at their finest, tireless, versatile, energetic and able to show to best advantage all the subtleties and drive of Fosse's limitless invention. The lighting is perfect and the camera work magical. I don't know they did it with a live show with no chance for retakes. I've danced in Musicals in Hollywood in the 50's and later directed television and in my opinion this is the best you'll ever see of Fosse's work."
2,Did Not Live Up To It's Hype.,"Ben Vareen is simply embarrassing and to such an extent that his final spot should be quickly 'Fast Forward'.Much of what is happening on stage is lost because the camera repeatedly jumps from full frontal to the left, then to the right, then back to full stage. During this off-putting camera work it also jumps from close-up to distant. Big Spender was thus ruined.The magic of the original Broadway show and cast is completely lost. Fosse would have been furious and both he and Fred Astaire would be turning over in their graves."
4,dvd,"This is a great DVD showing what a wonderful chorographer Bob Fosse was. Ben Vereen, Ann Reinking and cast do a dynamic job of his dance steps. I would highly recommend this DVD."
2,Fosse: NOT the Original Cast,"I saw the original on Broadway shortly after it opened. I bought the original cast CD at the theater. Much as I like Ann Reinking (saw her in Chicago about the same time), she and Ben Vereen are getting long in the tooth. Vereen, particularly,really messes up some good numbers. Valerie Pettiford was so much better in Blackbird. People should know that they are not seeing the cast that won the Tony award. Even the supporting dancers are inferior."
2,Disappointing.,"Having seen the show 3 times (once in Boston before it hit Broadway and twice on the Great White Way) I was looking forward to PBS's production. I was greatly disappointed.I agree with so many of the people here who commented on how the choreography was not executed with the precision and poise necessary to Fosse's work. The spark and energy seem to be missing from many of the numbers. Ben Vereen also makes it a different show. On Broadway it was truly an ensemble piece. Putting one large personality into the mix really changes the flavor of the whole piece.I can empathize with those who cherish this as the only version of the show on record, but it's somewhat of a shame not to see the real thing."
2,A pale imitation of an innovator,"I saw the show on stage. I saw most of the original productions that are reprised in this. Unfortunately, this is Ann Reinking's version of Bob Fosse. Reinking is a great performer who was considered the quintessential Fosse dancer of the 70's and 80's created this tribute. The difference is Ann Reinking has taken the Fosse style and utilized this to create a style of her own.As a tribute to Fosse this is inaccurate. Therefore, for Fosse aficiandos this is not an acurate recreation but an interpretation of his works. Also, there is a too big reliance on his concept musical ""Dancin'"".The one good thing in this is the addition of another Fosse creation Ben Vereen. He shows why he can still pack a house.My suggestion is to rent Fosse films like Sweet Charity and All that Jazz. You'll get to see the real Fosse."
2,Unsatisfied,When I order a full face printable I'm looking for one that the face is not interrupted with a divider near the hub. HP and Phillips does that except Phillips incorporates it's name there. Bad. I am a recording artist and label my cd's with a photo and titles of songs so I need the full to the hub printable cd's.Armas Ristamaki
2,They are NOT silver.,"I bought these CD-Rs under the assumption that the recording surface was actually silver, as advertised. It turns out that the surface is actually the typical light-green CD-R color that you would find on an average CD-R. Customer service resolved the issue for me, however it appears that they have yet to change the advertised product description. These discs are NOT silver underneath. They are light-green."
4,Fast-paced + limited dialogue + all action = FUN,"No cover, no reload, none of that nonsense. Get progressively bigger guns, destroy progressively bigger things. It's a hoot. This game reminds me a lot of the old arcade game Smash TV -- keep moving, keep shooting. Its simplicity proves to be surprisingly fun and challenging."
5,Best game ever!,"- fun as hell- plays on almost any computer- co-op mode- dirt cheapif you enjoy fps' at all, you're doing yourself a disservice by not owning this game"
5,excellent game,"i really wish more sequels were like this one, the story is AMAZING and captivating,so are the graphics and voice-acting.simply lovely!!"
2,Poor...,I love the first Shadow Hearts. This game does not have the same dark gothic theme that the original had and takes the storyline in a complete different direction. This is very disappointing to say the least. I hate to see sequels to wonderful games that turn out this way.
4,Writing for Quick Cash,"Product arrived in perfect condition, altho' this product was back-ordered creating a problem for starting on time with the Barnes & Noble class it was ordered for. Still deciding if it is worthy of purchase. Info is good, but ?up to date? .... Thx"
4,Seems to work well,No idea how secure it is but it fits well in my pack and it's long enough to hook around a pole or pillar when the bike racks aren't available. I ride an ebike so I like to snake it through several parts of the bike so they aren't gone when I come back out.
5,Thick and Strong Cables,"This is a great security cable for the back of the truck or a storage bay to secure items to a permanent structure such as a wall or chassis. Nothing flimsy about it. The cable is 15mm thick wich is more than half inch in diameter and the hard plastic linning is sturdy and rigid. You would need a big set of Bolt Cutters to be able to cut through these and then because they are rope like metal strand fibers that make up the cable it would not be an easy task for anyone to cut through them, so you'd probably have to use a cutting saw (electric or gas) with a metal cutting blade. In other words, this is a high level security cable that would take a very deliberate and substantial effort to override. Recommend."
1,Do not buy,"This cable is not 15mm steel. The total diameter which includes plastic coating is 15mm. The actual steel cable is only 1/4"". Cut of the coating and see for your self. Trimax sucks. This is not a high security cable. You are better off buying 3/8"" chain. Do not waste your money on TRIMAX products. They false avertise 15mm steel cable about this product."
2,A Poor Imitation of The Beatles Anthology Book,"I adore Paul McCartney as anyone who knows me will tell you. However, I find myself dissatisfied as a consumer of some of his products. The reason seems to be the mentality of whomever it is who conceives these ideas...i.e., that Paul's hardcore fans will buy any bone we decide to throw at them. I get the same feel from the Lennon camp.This book is only O.K. with only a few nice surprises. Some pages seem empty and void of material. It's kind of weird.I do not recommend it, unless you find a cheap used copy like I did."
2,fragile,"I barely had this gun nozzle for a month before the handle cracked, shooting water into my face the next time I used it. I would only consider this product if you're very careful with your tools; otherwise, spend the extra money and get something more durable."
2,Nancy goes to Rio a bomb/Two Weeks with Love good,"Two weeks with love was cute, loved Ricardo Montalban and Jane Powell. Lighthearted as you would expect.But the companion movie - Nancy goes to Rio was a huge disapointment, even giving it a break on how cheesy movies were during that era. Not a good deal to buy both movies."
5,wonderful movies,"I had these movies on VHS and was wanting to upgrade my collection. It took forever to find a place that supplied them... Thanks Amazon...for a wonderful, delightful movie combo!!"
3,Ther must be a better way,"I just bought this kit and even as a well educated person, and someone who does a lot of sewing and crafts, these directions are difficult to understand at best. I wish they would show more pictures of exactly how the rubber rings fit on, and how the snap pieces fit within them. I have tried every way possible, and the one that seems to match the directions the best does not produce good results because the rubber rings get in the way. They either cause one or both parts of the snap to move as the pliers are closed, and the snap does not line up right, or it gets the rubber ring caught between the snap pieces when squeezed together. There must be a better way to install snaps easily and quickly. I will keep trying it to see if practice makes perfect, but for a busy mom of 3 little ones, I would rather spend my time on more important things than figuring out how to get the snap pliers to work well. I may look into getting another tool, even if it's more expensive."
2,It is extremely hard to use on snap buttons,I want to use it for snap fastener buttons but it is not as easy as it should be. 50% chances are screw up. Alignment is always off. I have to snap at least twice to get a good snap. It doesn't do a good compression job on the button neither. it is not worth to spend money on it.
1,Snap Tool Doesn't Work,"I am reading the reviews searching for any possible further insight on how to use this tool. My duvet cover is all made, except for inserting the snaps. I thought it would be easy, and even bought a new snap tool, so I would have the little rubber rings, which are not sold separately. I have tried and tried and can't make things align and hold. I guess I'll have to go out and buy a couple of zippers to insert instead. The tool will have to go to the scrap heap."
2,Beauty but hard to wear.,"My wife was very happy when I gave she the shoes, but the thing change when she tried to wear it. The shoes was so hard and unconfortable that she only wear it for 30 minutes and no more. Actually the shoes are store in the closet, because she doesn't tolerate them."
2,sm new york women's always ballet flat,shoe sizing not accurate; shoes are uncomfortable; the glue binding the top of the shoe to the bottom of the shoe is too noticeable.
5,Life Changer!,"At first I was a little skeptical about becoming a vegetarian, I really wanted to become one for health reasons, but then I picked up this book. I read it and fell in love with vegetarian recipes. Jeanne Tiberio's book was the best book about vegetarian cuisine in the store. I recommend it to anyone who wants to become a vegetarian or who is one. The food was delicious and now I have something to cook every night. My husband no longer complains!"
3,Vegetarian Homestyle Cooking: A Heart-Healthy Guide to Lowfat Eating et al Jeanne Tiberio,It's okay. It's like most cookbooks where you find only a few you would consider. I'm not a vegetarian so my opinion should not be considered.
4,Great historical drama,"This is a great historical drama about the horsemen of Afganistan and the transition between the past and the modern world. You really need to see the movie with O'mar Shariff and Jack Palance first then the book has more context, Kessler is a little overly desriptive of some geography and emotional scenes but that seems to be his style of writing.A lot of older movies are kind of disapointing when you watch them years later cause the production values are so dated. Not the case with this classic film, the book and the film do equal justice to each other. This is a good read about the relationship of a strong father and son, kind of Lonesome Dove -ish. GOOD READ!"
4,"Hard Heavy, and kickass.","Purely Satanic! Just all out Aggro/Thrash, some real talented Death Metal, pick up this album or at least give it a listen, U shan't (and I guarantee), be dissapointed."
3,A Bit Rehashed...,"Aside from 'Activate the Anarchus', most of this album is a rehashing of early artists. I find little, if any innovation here. Its not bad, just not great. If you're just looking for something listenable, this is fine. If you're looking for something more original, look elsewhere."
3,Cannot Rate,I gave this product to a friend so I dont know how well it worked for them. I was going to return it but it cost more to refurn vs giving it away. I recommend ProShot - that one defintely works.
5,More than expected,This product did more than I expected. Applied it to a really old worn kitchen tiled floor and it looked great.
5,Works great,"This product does a great job. Easy to apply, dries quickly and gives a nice shine while hiding scratches. I plan on doing all my wooden floors with this product."
4,Restore-A-Floor,"My friend had done her hardwood kitchen floor which is a busy traffic area in her home. I noticed that the floor was so shiny and I thought she had just done it because it looked wet. It was beautiful. She showed me the product and said it was easy to apply. I looked for the product online and ordered 2 bottles for myself. I applied in to my dinette, living room and hallway. My floors look brand new and I'm delighted!"
2,But can you wash it,When I applied this to a section of my floor I first noticed that it does not smell very nice. But I had the product so I continued to use it. As I was finishing up my 19 X19 ft floor I happened to get my soapy water on a portion of the floor where Restore-A-Floor had previously been applied and to my astonishment the brick colored tile turned an ugly milky white! I scrubbed it and reapplied the floor finish and it was OK but I am now afraid I can not wash my floor with soap. I will ultimately need to contact the maker to see how to remove this product as the label doesn't say. Wish I could feel more positive about this situation.
1,restore a floor,"No better than what you can purchase at a store-I've tried many products to help with my wood floors buy really this is one is no better. It's not a bad product, it does what it says, but the I've bought other cheaper products that do the same right from the grocery store. I wont purchase again."
4,Works so farr,"I'd probably rate this product a 5 star but I want to wait and see how the results hold up.I used it on wood floors that were slightly scratched and dinged, however very worn where you could see the finish was coming off of them. This product makes them look relatively new again! I also waited a full day rather than the 45 minutes for it to dry. I found you will have problems if you walk on it without allowing sufficient time to dry.Even after walking on the floors with wet feet, there were no issues. If you have floors that are very worn but not too scratched up, I would recommend this product."
2,Disappointed,"Product produced an immediate shine, but it did not last more than 2-3 days. It was a lot of work for no lasting results."
4,Is he dumb or what ?,"This play is certainly a brilliantly written piece. In the midst of tragedy there rises some of the most beautiful language Shakespeare ever wrote. However, maybe the people 300 years ago sympathised with Lear, but I held no sympathy for him because it was his folly which caused his misfortune, and I was so frustrated with him by the end of the play that I was sort of glad that he got what he deserved for being so idiotic. I think that a more fitting name for the play would be The Tragedy of Queen Cordelia since she is the only one I walked out feeling sorry for."
2,Brest songs can't save weak singers,The majority of the singers are unknown and I think for good reason. Many seemed unprepared with one performer reading the lyrics off a stand. Even the name performers seemed to struggle with staying on key and in tone. A big disappointment.
4,Bacharach songs are always great!!!,great sax solo on opening the show. mostly UK artists. but good renditions of the hitsongs of yesteryears. Love the Alfie rendition of Sumudu Jayatilaka. Lovely girl too. A fitting closing is Dionne Warwick who immortalized numerous of Burt and Hal's songs.
3,A must for any Bacharach-David fan,"Here is a concert filmed in beautiful Royal Albert Hall, with a superb orchestra and top-of-the-line sound system, featuring every major (and even a few lesser-known) Bacharach-David song. That being said, many of the performances are sub-standard, sung by little-known performers (outside the UK). Even the big-name stars such as Petula Clark and Dionne Warwicke, are quite frankly well past their primes, and their voices (particularly Petula's) are shamefully wobbly, tired and painful to listen to. This concert would have been a first-class event with an A-list roster of performers. Still, the setting, orchestrations and choice of songs makes it a must for any serious Bacharach-David fan."
5,The BEST guidebook EVER!,"As a life-long obsessive New York Shopper, I thought I knew it all until I found this book. Not only was the book loaded with great little boutiques and bargains I didn't know about, but its Label Locator Index allows you to find EVERY label in New York City and lists EVERY store that carries it. Bravo!"
1,An Absolute Waste,I have seen this danced by the Royal Ballet in the 1960s and by the Kirov in 1996. This is a travesty. Snippets of the music... not the full score with scene fillers by some other modernist. This to me was a porn version - shortened at 85 minutes - the full score runs more than 140 and even the traditional La Scala version is 115.I was a fool not to read the reviews fully here before I purchased. I since have bought the LaScala version which is fine. The first customer review about says it all - don 't pay any attention to the official Amazon one.Everyu thing here is trashed...music dancing and story.
1,travesty,"This was the worst version of Romeo and Juliet imaginable.Ugly sets, ugly costumes, ugly choreography.I watched it all the way thru hoping it would improve. Never did. I was glad when it ended."
2,ABYSMAL ADDITIONS TO THE SCORE,"I had looked forward to seeing this production - or ANY production - of Prokofiev's masterpiece but the intrusive and clangorous intrusions into Prokofiev's score by a ""composer"" by the name of Goran Vejvoda utterly ruined the experience for me.Nagano's conducting of the superb Lyon Opera Orchestra is exemplary, as usual, but the additions to a fully-realised score of genius by Prokofiev were an affront to good taste and dramatic sensibility.The dancing is above average but it is truly unfortunate that Goran Vejvoda was allowed to destroy and make hackneyed the superb score of Serge Prokofiev.Timothy Wingate, Ottawa, Canada"
1,book REVIEWS should do what they say on the packet,the only problem with this book is that it's not very good. would people stick to reviewing it instead of launching wild political polemics ?
1,Should warn return shipment cost more than the cost of the ladder,"It is not 4ft, since you can not stand on that top step which has many holes and bumps, so it would not add 4ft to your height, but worst of all, I was told to pay $103 for return shipment. I paid about $9.85 for shipment when I purchased, and did not know I had to pay $103 for return which the seller refused to pay. Why I pay $103 to return when the ladder cost less than $60. That means I have to keep the ladder which I would never use."
3,Ottoman,Very nice except for the fact that the top of the ottoman does not stay on very well...I need to put some sort of hinge...otherwise...love the color and style.
3,Not fully satisfied,"I like it. However, my expectation was high but the biography is kind of too brief and short to me."
1,DO NOT BUY - AVOID THESE PEOPLE,"These people are not to be dealt with.They are liars:The write up says, ""Set includes a 38"" square table and four comfortable, high-back chairs"". When you order this, it will not arrive with chairs, and the company will offer no apology.They supply damaged materials:We ordered 2 tables. One was quite smashed.They have terrible customer service:So far it is 2 months after I have sent back the table, and still I have not received my credit."
1,Not worth the overprice,"I wasted my money on this. The surface of the mirror is nearly flat, so it doesn't provide proper blind spot coverage. I had to buy the cheezy stick on blind spot mirrors to adhere over these. Plus these won't mount to the curved top of the factory side view mirrors because the mounting hardware is straight. Therefore, I had to mount the new mirrors to the bottom of my side view mirrors which gives you a view of the pavement below (not helpful). Completely disatisfied."
3,Great Planes Bad Controles,The planes look great. They are the best renderings of miltary planes that I have seen in a flight sim. They are on par with the rest of the planes that are packaged with the game. However the cockpits .... Hardly any of the guages on the panels are interactive. The panels can't be edited because they are of a file format that the FS2002 editing program can't read. There are no auto pilot controles for the F-15's and F-16's. This makes it hard to hold a course and altitude. On top of that there is no afterburners for these planes. It would have been great if the missles could be fired.
5,Great Codes!,the codes to add voice reco to my chatbots are the best ! this book also did a great job in presenting the tools to create chatbots fast. I got 3 girl bots running on aol within a few hours. Monica's ideas for how to use chatbots have me thinking of hundreds of possibilities for more work.
5,When Someone You Love Has a Mental Illness,"This is a handbook for families, friends, and caregivers of those with mental illness. It provides clear-cut guidelines, with chapter summaries laid out in useful, easy-to-read charts that include specific suggestions. Very practical, very informative. Covers about any topic related to mental illness you can think of. This book should be required reading for anyone dealing with a loved one with mental illness."
3,moderately helpful,I found this moderately helpful. Good on using resources - if they are available.
2,not adequate information,"Although the title seemed very promising, I was dissapointed by the absolute thesis of the author, concerning the role of heredity in the development of the illness, as well as the the limited information as a whole."
3,Basic info for recently diagnosed family member,This book reinforced guidelines provided in family therapy for integrating a recently diagnosed family member. It provides little info for a family about how to re-integrate an adult mentally ill person back into the family of origin.
4,"Beautiful fan, well made, works quite well, lamp not so good","This is a very attractive fan, it's quiet and well made. We've had it for about 3 years and a ceiling fan is really the answer for us. The three speed remote and reverse works just fine and I don't think we've ever replaced the batteries in the remote. We mounted it using the minimum drop down, the tube extends only about an inch or so, close to the ceiling (8' ceiling) and it's just fine.We don't really use the lamp. It produces a rather dull low quality of light. The diffuser seems to block most of the light. But that's not what we bought it for. So lose a star for that.We just felt it was one of the better looking fans out there, but that's really just a subjective call. I would definitely buy again, and may get another one for the bedroom at some point."
3,So So,The book was okay but not as thorough as I had anticipated. I'll keep it for my genalogy work but it is not my first choice.
5,Knowing The Cults,It was a great book letting one know something about almost every existing cult in the world. It expesses 'why' we are christians. Over the years I've had to order more than a couple copies for friends. Highly recommended.
3,If you can look past the bias...,"It's a pretty good book. Gave me the information I was looking for but it's significantly biased toward Christianity. At the very beginning, they say they want to present an ""objective"" view of all the religions, then immediately after, they say Christianity is the only religion that is completely true. And how do we know this? Well, because God said so, of course! It's right there in the Bible!! Then they go on to discuss the other religions and at the end of each, they compare them to Christianity and to each other (which is good), but then they say ""here are all the reasons why this religion is wrong."""
1,Quality is junk,"My father owned this sprinkler for many years and it worked great. I purchased one from Amazon, rec'd it express delivery today, and it is junk. One brass jet is missing, one fell out and would not screw back in, and others are loose. When I called Amazon and asked to be shipped one that has actually been checked (i.e., quality control), agent said it is out of stock. He said Amazon is happy to refund my $, but that is not the issue--the reviews about this sprinkler suggest Amazon has a quality control problem. Why haven't they contacted Melnor and corrected it? I am NOT a happy customer!"
4,A classy sprinkler that also gets the job done,"I decided to pick up one of these back-and-forth sprinklers after dealing with the problems of the unevel spray from a circular model. The sprinkler looks really nice, with brass jets, metal construction, and what looks to be a hand-numbered serial number written on the bottom in gold pen. Classy.Mine came with a little white air bubble on the plastic that holds the oscillating bar, but it doesn't really affect the performance or overall looks. What did give me some problems, however, was the fact that the oscillating bar can shift its position in the plastic. After fiddling with the spray adjuster knob for a while, trying to get it to spray on both sides, I decided to try and turn the jets myself. Turns out it had just shifted out of place. Maybe it had gotten knocked out of place during shipping or soething, but it's all better now.Now my lawn is well-watered, so I need to find another excuse. Can't fault the manufacturer for that."
2,"I don't like it in its orginal form, re-engineering required","I had to add a spacer to the sprinkler arm to prevent it from blowing out the ""hose"" end of the sprinkler. I sent Melnor photos of my re-engineering of their defective product but have yet to hear back from them. It is a fine sprinkler now but understand that if you purchase one you may have the same problem I had. If I could insert photos of the fix I would do so."
4,Oldie But Goodie,"This book contains the first 2 out of 4 stories about the dynamic O'Hurley family.In the first book, Last Honest Woman, we meet Abby the middle triplet. She is a widow of many years raising two sons on a struggling horse farm. She has consented to let writer Dylan Crosby stay on her farm and write her deceased husbands biography in order to make some money. First Dylan has to decipher whats fact and whats fiction. A good start to the series.In the second story, Dance To The Piper, we meet the youngest triplet, Maddy. She is a broadway star who is falling for her shows money man, Reed Valentine. These two couldn't be more opposite but you will be rooting for them all the way.You will fall in love with the O'Hurley's and look forward to the next book that contains oldest triplet Chantel and big brother Trace's stories. This is old Nora, but a great read."
5,Double Delight,I like getting two books in one. That way I don't loose the thread of the story before I get to the next book. I have been a fan of Nora Roberts for many years and find her multi-book series to be most enjoyable.
5,Borrn O'Hurley nora roberts,"nora has written two more great books. Where does she get her ideas? The tripleta are as awesome as they can be. In the second book, brother Trace gets into the act. What a family."
4,Born O'Hurley,I actually read the 2nd set of books 1st & then wanted to read the 1st set. These are really good books. Make sure you get all 4 of the O'Hurley's stories there great.
1,Very Poor Quality Products,"I have made a significant investment over the years in numerous Gardena watering products--sprinklers, shut-off valves, diverters, etc. ALL have failed in the short-term after modest use. In addition, contacts to the company for replacement or customer service have been met with no response. MY BEST ADVICE--stay away from Gardena products. Looks (from other posted comments)like my experience is not unique!"
1,"Shoddy, Shoddy","I purchased one at a local hardware store, and had the flimsy plastic end connector snap off the first time it was used. The store gladly exchanged for another one, and the exact same thing happened. For the fewer $$ I went and bought a heavy duty brass Y connector and 2 smaller brass Y connectors and made a much sturdier 4 tap system."
4,Gardena 4 Channel Water Distributor,"I disagree with the negative reviews about the durability of this item. The latest production isn't flimsy plastic; the body is some kind of industrial resin that I don't believe would break unless you drove over it with a car. The only problem I have is that I haven't figured out where is the highest flow position of the valve, and there's no instruction about that. I have used Gardena products for over 20 years, and I have never had one fail."
3,works as well as most,I'd hoped this cut-off valve would work better than most. It's okay. Of course the big plus is that it fits in easily with the Gardena line. The line is overall excellent and has a long use life. I continue to use this valve but it has never had the tight seal I expect from Gardena quick-connect modules.
3,Not the greatest...,"As everyone has written, this teapot does not pour well. It spills all over. Mine does make noise though. It makes a very interesting sound and it's very loud. I was puzzled the first time I heard it b/c I was expecting a whistle!I like that it matches, so I'm going to put up with the mess and just pour over the sink. I will not buy another one when this one bites the dust though."
2,WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE TEAKETTLE,"I HAVE FOUND THAT THE TEAKETTLE DRIPS WATER WHEN YOU ARE POURING THE WATER INTO THE CUP. IT REALLY MAKES A MESS AND IF YOU ARE NOT CAREFUL YOU CAN GET A SERIOUS BURN. ALSO, THE LITTLE FINGER PIECE ON THE WHISTLE SNAPPED OFF THE FIRST TIME I USED IT."
3,Corelle callaway whistler tea kettle,"I have had 3 of these. I love the look and it matches my kitchen. The first whistled loudly but did dribble water on the counter when we poured if it was still boiling. I just poured over the sink so it wasn't an issue. #2 wouldn't whistle at all so I exchanged it. #3 has a faint whistle. All 3 dribble and spill. The teapot that didn't whistle at all didn't spill and looked as good, but we burned it up, that's why we switched to the whistler."
1,Not even worth one star,"What good is a whistling tea kettle if it just spews out the spout all over your stovetop. No whistle, no warning... It's just for looks I guess - although there is no warning regarding this. TOTALLY unfunctional and would have loved to have spent that money on something far more useful."
4,Callaway Whistling Teakettle,"This is the second teakettle of this brand and style I have purchased. It matches my dishes, and coordinates with my kitchen themes and colors. I did have the trouble with the spout as noted in other reviews, but have learned that pouring slowly keeps that inconvenience to a minimum."
1,Pathetic,"OK, Now that it is official that they didn't beat the market, they have reversed gears and try to address the savings part. Nothing to differentiate this from a zillion other such books. I should grant them one thing, they know how to market their name to catch on the gullible."
5,Just got it !,I was particularly attracted by the 1-hour teaching sessions because computer books can be sooooooo long it is difficult to find the information that you need. I paid 18 pounds for it in England - why are books so much less in the US? (rhetorical questions)
3,A decent Overview Of Most Frontpage Functions,"It is an overall clear, concise, and well organized instruction manual that goes over most Frontpage elements. However, for some of the more advanced elements, such as style sheets, it barely touches, and instead suggests buying more books from the same publisher. Some of the examples in the book are too advanced for the instructions it gives. Would reccomend to anyone not familiar with Frontpage and just starting; it is an excellent first step and is very informative about various web topics.Unfortunately, it is really nothing more than that, despite its claims as a comprehensive instruction manual."
2,hard read,"difficult to get the time lines, difficult to grasp on the book, actually booring after reading the book by Glenn Beck"
2,Too Dry For My Tastes,"I have read a few biographies and wanted to read dome classics, but I just couldn't get into this one. Very dry and not a lot of historical information. I stopped reading after the first chapter and couldn't get interested in it again. O'Rielly's Killing Lincoln was so much better."
4,Good autobiography,"I recently saw Marc speak at a local PFLAG meeting here in the Seattle area. I totally related to the story of his life and some of the things he has gone through, most people that are gay and grew up in a strict religious family will probably relate as well. Marc tells the story of struggle as a gay teenager and discovering himself at college. It was encouraging to see how far he has come when he spoke. From what I understand this is Adam's first book and at times the details drag on but what a promising first book it is! Great job, highly recommended!"
2,Certainly not the worst,"While certainly not the worst memoir of a person's life in a prejudicial society, it lacked poor character development. It was difficult to keep up with characters when their names were used without developing descriptions. It was a literary disappointment. The events themselves were astounding, but without these descriptions to relate to the reader, it fails to draw an audience. The author needs to learn more metaphorical and detail-oriented literary techniques. There were also grammatical errors in my hardback copy. I hope these errors have been corrected in later editions."
2,Sad,"I saw the author in the Seattle area . its a shame he takes such an experience and turns it around and uses the guilt he felt of his homosexuality towards religion .The book could have been an inspiration to all , instead it becomes a substitute for prejudice by promoting another form of it ."
4,A Good Spray Gun,"The Gardena system works for me. I use the spray gun while watering plants, washing off walks, washing cars, etc. The sprayer has four settings for different output. I like the fact that the sprayer can be coupled / de-coupled from a pressurized hose with minimal leaks. Just remember, if you plan to attach this spray gun to a pressurized hose, squeeze the trigger while attaching - otherwise you'll never be able to overcome the 80 PSI in the hose.My spray gun is 1-1/2 years old and continues to work perfectly. The connectors are plastic, so I wonder about long-term durability - I have not experienced any problems yet, and have observed minimal leaks."
5,It ROCKS!,"It will BLAST, it will sprinkle, and everything in between. Almost a power washer! Gentle enough to water plants, forceful enough to peel paint. The ultimate sprayer."
1,broke easily,"I am an avid flower gardener, especially potted ones, so I must water everyday in the hot summer. this sprayer leaked and broke very easily. Around the connections water would spray out and this was less than 1 year old."
4,Excellent book,"This book is worth it's weight in gold if you are the owner of a Yamaha digital piano. Even though the book is 10 years old, all the 50 songs are preset in the keyboard. And with a Yamaha you can slow the song down, play just the left or right hand by itself. Great for learning.The only drawback would be the fact that the book does not stay flat on the music stand, it is not spiral bound - I ended up taking photocopies of the songs that interested me."
4,A moving and incisive portrayal,"Larry Vanderveen performs a brilliant one man show as he smoothly assumes the persona of F. Scott Fitzgerald. Elegant in a well cut double breasted blazer, perfectly creased slacks and pristine white shirt and pocket square, Vanderveen as Fitzgerald reflects on his life and work. Vanderveen's gentle recital, effortlessly moving from irony to comic reminiscence to deep regret, conveys a superb impression of the brilliant but tragically star-crossed writer. Honest and unsparing of himself, he describes the struggles to succeed with his books - never truly fulfilled during his life - his terrible struggles with alcoholism and, most poignant of all, the beautiful, self destructive, doomed Zelda. Vanderveen's tone and expressions never pall; this is very well worth watching."
5,Poignant and inspiring,"It's true that this production is not a year-by-year recounting of Fitzgerald's life, but if you are looking for that read Wikipedia. I totally disagree with the reviewer who says this is not for students. Unless your goal is to have your students know the author's birth and death years, his principle works, and nothing about what made him tick. This is, in my opinion, a VERY insightful, moving piece of dramatic theatre, which provides a deep look into the man's often lonely thoughts and emotions. For example, when he talks about Ernest Hemingway. Frankly, the other reviewer's comments sum up a lot of what is wrong about today's education; boring facts are emphasized over inner, perceptive truths, which needless to say tell you a great deal more about what has real significance."
3,depends on what you want this performance to do for you,Meeting with F. Scott Fitzgerald is a long-winded single-person depiction of F. Scott Fitzgerald. There isn't a lot of enthusiasm in this performance and if you're using it to instruct students on this author - don't get this one! This is not something students (nor I) will sit through. I was looking for a solo performance for Forensic kids and drama students but this is just too boring. Most of the information he presents is better learned in the A&E biography on him - if you're using it for informational purposes for a study on him and his novels. Not recommended for use with high school students.
5,The best underground trance album from a real Belgian club.,"Club x is a cd, compiling the best trance the club has to offer.Club x is real, this cd originally had tickets for the club in it, the remix of cygnus x is the best."
4,Amazing? Maybe ...,"I have been practicing Raja Yoga for years. Haanel discusses techniques that will change your life, bring wealth, happiness, and good health. What I don't understand is why some of the great souls like Ramakrishna, and Vivekananda died so young. Maybe they should have read this book. Really, it is interesting reading, and well researched. I'm not sure about the techniques he describes."
2,Book Review,"The book was not in what I would call good condition, the cover is very soiled and worn, there is a stain on the pages, and there was also many rabbit eared pages."
5,"Long time user, first time writer","Bought my first set of these quick connects about 25 years ago and finally needed some replacements. Couldn't find them at any store. When I checked the internet, only stores in England carried them. I wrote the company and they suggested I buy them from amazon. I did. I now have replacements for my 25 year old connectors. Hope they last as long."
3,Read before you order,"Guess I didn't read carefully enough. This item is not a complete hose-to-faucet connection like I've purchased in the past. This is only the part that screws into the hose. The part that screws onto the faucet has to be purchased separately. Seems odd to me to sell the two parts separately, since one is no good without the other. Misleading marketing, I think, to show both parts on the package when both aren't included. Too inexpensive to bother returning, but I've had to order the other part to complete the connection. I can't accurately rate the connector as a whole until I have both parts in hand."
5,Great example of the Human Spirit,This is a excellent film showcasing determination and a sense of adventure. It's also funny and almost made me want to get up off the couch and do something. Highly recommended for outdoorsy types and couch potatoes alike.
5,One of the best SWEET VALLEY HIGH books!,"I loved LAST WISH. It was such an incredible book that I couldn't put it down until I finished it (I had borrowed it from my town's library). In LAST WISH, Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield are turning 17 years old. Elizabeth wants to throw Jessica a birthday party that Jessica will never forget...and Jessica wants to do the same for Elizabeth, unknowingly that they both want to give each other birthday parties! Through all their secret birthday party planning, it all seems to go smoothly and perfectly until an earthquake shakes Sweet Valley and ruins it all! To find out what happens, you must read this book. An excellent addition to your SWEET VALLEY HIGH collection. Also, check out parts 2 EARTHQUAKE and 3 AFTERSHOCK, to find out the conclusion of this awesome SWEET VALLEY HIGH Super Special Saga."
5,William does it again!!!!,"Kate William does it again! She always manages to keep the readers intranced in a book. I think that Liz should have just got with Devon. Like Jessica, I think that those 2 were as boring at bread & butter. At the twins 17 birthday party an earthquake strikes. This book makes you want to run everywhere and find the next 2 books. It's keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's a MUST read."
5,Take A Deep Breath and Prepare...,"It's the most devastating thing to happen to Sweet Valley yet! Liz and Jess are seventeen! But something happens during the Bash of the Century. EARTHQUAKE!! Enid is barely alive. Todd, Lila, Ken, and Olivia are missing and thought to be dead. Elizabeth and Jessica are separated with no way to contact each other.Who will live? Who will die? Will the Twin's seventeenth birthday be their last?To get all the romance, action, and terror...read Last Wish!"
4,Suspenseful,"It's the twins' 17th birthday, and they are once again struck by disaster. First their plans are in for trouble. Then come the horrible earthquake. Will the twins and their friends survive to even be seniors?"
4,The Makeshift Husband,The 3rd book in this series is as good as the other two. Quick read and good representation of pioneer life in Nebraska.
2,Excellent first half,"Loved the first half of this one. Some of the most effective gore I have read in a long time. The reason behind the character's actions and dining habits is made clear and consise. This book was a more abstract look at obsession than it was an effective story, but when the main character is exploring his need to consume his own flesh, the novel was wonderful. Then in the second half there was an attempt to redeem the flesh eating protagonist, and after his brutal acts I could not get behind his quest for redemption no matter how hard the author fancied it up with mysticsm and spitualism.A must for wannabe horror writers looking to learn techniques to write a perfect gore symphony, but as a story this iece misses the mark. Ballsy though."
1,THIS IS WAY BEYOND GROSS! IT IS JUST PLAIN OUT SICK!!!,"1 star is being very generous in rating this book! Don't get me wrong, I love a good horror story but this is not horror! There are few books that I don't at least finish to see if there is some literary worth to them. This is one of the very few that I DID NOT finish. This book is gruesome, gory, absolutely disgusting, in addition to BORING. If you are looking for an entertaining, sitting on the edge of your seat, bump in the dark read...this is NOT for you! The best place for this book is the trash can."
2,Not As Tasty As It Might Look,"But not so bad that you can't read it. It's entertaining in its own right, the story interesting enough to keep you reading. Definitely has a high ""blech"" factor. Not at all for the squeamish. Quality of writing is fair enough. I've read far worse, that's for certain."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!,"This book had neither plot nor any characters that you could actually feel for or care about. You are constantly waiting for the ""purpose"" or the plot to thicken, wonder where are we going here? The ""speech"" and thought patterns of the characters are very juvenile. The Catholic background of the main character does not even relate to the nature of this book. Flesh eating habits did not gross me out but made me wonder why I even picked up a book with this title. Life is too short to waste on bad books...almost anything would be better."
2,...She's written better--MUCH better!!,"I became a fan of Mary Ann Mitchell's, when I read her book ""Sips of Blood.""--Immediately, I was hooked!So, I sought out her first novel: ""Drawn to the Grave""...Again, EXCELLENT...Then came the second book in her vampire series, that began with ""Sips of Blood""--""Quenched""...I couldn't WAIT for the next book..Then--DISASTER!: ""Ambrosial Flesh""It isn't so much that the book is 'bad', it just does not live up to the standard set by her other books.It starts out promising..then takes a turn for the BORING, during the second half.I am HAPPY to report, however, that here latest book, ""Cathedral of the Vampires"", which is the third book in her vampire series is EXCELLENT!!So, if you did not like this, particular, book--PLEASE, give her other ones a try! :)"
1,A perverted waste of time.,"As a horror fan I was astounded that this book could be so bad. The plot about a man driven to eat human flesh could have been written as an excellent serial killer novel in which the man begins tasting and then goes too far and actually kills his prey. How wrong this one turned. Part II of this book is truly boring. Instead of this man's obsession turning him into a serial killer, the plot turns strange and he begins waging war against the devil, humanized as a man named Yakut who claims the man as his son (the Antichrist). The rest of the book takes place in the sewer and the darkness- rats, baby eating, and burning flesh couldn't be more creepy. In a word, this book [is bad]!"
1,I want a refund!,"That's right, gentle reader. Not only do I want a refund but I want to regain the hours of my life that I lost reading this insipid, mediocre book. This is probably the worst book I have ever read (and I've read a lot).Oh, where to begin.... The slow begining? The one-dimensional characters? The predictable plot? The disappointing ending? The author tried to compensate her poor writing with gratuitous gore and failed miserably. I could go on and on. If you really want to read the book, I suggest you read the ""teaser"" at the beginning. It's the only thing worth reading."
3,Gruesome Flesh Eating,"This is a very unique, disturbing, and entertaining novel. It's the story of Jonathan both as a boy and a man and his dark fascination and perversion of flesh eating. For most of his early life, he would taste and eat his own flesh, but as he grows older he begins to have the desire to eat other people's flesh as well.If you are squeamish and are easily offended, then this book is defiantly not for you. Many parts of the story are gory, gruesome, and downright morbid. However, if you keep the descriptive accounts in perspective, you'll find a very entertaining novel about a dark fetish and perversion towards cannibalism. The storyline stretches the limits of what is considered acceptable horror; almost a contradiction of terms. You may hate this book or love it but you will not be neutral to it. If horror and gore is what you're looking for, you're going to find it in this book."
5,The funniest woman alive or dead!,"Phyllis Diller is by far my favorite comedienne of all time! So glad she had such a long, happy life."
2,On Location Phyllis Diller,"We were looking forward to receiving Phyllis Diller Dvd, we were very disappointed ,we have just finished watching Bill Cosby compared to him she is an amatuer in jokes and putting them over we felt she was waiting for a laugh it has really put us off buying another one"
3,Another solid Nick Stone mission,"This Andy McNab book was not the action packed thrill ride I had been hoping for. Instead the tension was in Nick's stakeout and the gritty reality of covert ops. But this tension was also the flaw in the book as it did drag the pacing out. Somehow it lacked the ability to balance the tedium and tension to give us the feel of a stakeout which requires that on-edge alertness.The outline for the book from the Publishers Weekly does nail the book nicely:""Too much of his latest, however, is spent following Stone through the mundane details of mission preparation-staking out locations, following suspects, ruminating about possible scenarios. Instead of biting their nails, readers will be staring at them absently, bored by the colorless plot.""So while I enjoyed this book, it could have been slightly better written."
3,Still good but....,"I have enjoyed the author's previous books but the last 2 books have only been good. His character, Nick Stone, is a rugged, always bloodied, never say die individual. But his character alone cannot carry the story along. I thought him and his crew were fantastic as was the storyline. Then why was it only good? Way, way too many non essential details in describing the action especially the stakeouts. In real life I am sure that is what happens but detailing it as such can bring a book down as was this case. If it wasn't for me enjoying his previous books so much I would have rated it only fair.Mr.McNabb keep up your great characters and storylines but ease up on the excess details."
3,Not the best but..,"I read the other reviews and I can't totally disagree or agree. And after reading most of the other books (not in order), I just finished reading Crisis Four after Liberation Day, I have to say that if you really enjoyed the other books you'll probably still like this one.On that point, I do have to agree that it seemed to get a little tired. Like Andy wasn't trying that hard to make a good story. All the usual tradecraft descriptions were there, but the plot wasn't. The book is okay, but compared to some of his other books, it wasn't totally up to scratch.But if you've only read this book then you should probably pick up one of the other books to get a better idea what the series is like. Though if you don't like a litany of tradecraft descriptions then you'd probably not like the others as well. But to me that is all part of the charm of the series. It adds to realism.Better luck next time."
3,not his best,"McNab has written a number of thrilling books since leaving the SAS, but this one falls short. While endless radio checks and conversations may be realistic, that doesn't mean it makes for an exciting book. Let's hope McNab gets back on track as his other books were quite good."
2,thumbs down,"I've been a great fan of McNab's books, but I bought this one from Amazon several months ago and I still haven't finished it.Unlike previous McNab novels, this one just isn't as gripping and there really isn't anything great to say about it. It's not bad, but I think even existing fans of the Nick Stone series will, like myself struggle to enjoy this.I await the next McNab book with concern."
2,Not up with the others,"A flat read. The technical expertise is still there, but the dry sense of humour and British slang which grabbed me with Remote Control is long gone. Where, who knows...But the Nick Stone books are a fair bit poorer without them."
3,Sprinkler review,The turbo Drive Sprinkler makes two rotations to cover the designated area. The first pass produces a mist spray covering out to 3/4 of the selected diameter. The second pass produces more of a single stream with a narrow spray pattern to cover the outside 1/4 of the spray diameter. In a low water pressure situation the spray may leave a gap in coverage. Works best with high water pressure. Linking more than two sprinklers greatly reduces the coverage.
5,Best Sprinkler available anywhere !,I have used this sprinkler for several years and it was my absolute favorite - it is quiet and doesn't have that annoying sound that most sprinklers have. And it doesn't pool water at its base either.My dogs ate my old one and I am thrilled to find that I can replace it at Amazon ! Good price also ! Less than I originally paid !
2,Love-Hate Relationship!,"I love this sprinkler, but it broke less than a year after buying it. Not sure if I want to purchase another."
1,These batteries wont work in most devices,Turns out these batteries are only rated for 1.2v instead of the standard 1.5v. What does this mean? Your camera wont turn on; your Wii remote wont operate and your wireless mouse wont work.Unfortunately due to amazons lack of product labeling you may purchase these batteries only to be very disappointed.
3,Great performance/Bad reissue,"This is a fantastic performance of this symphony which I treasured for a long time...that is, until I came across the same performance on the Melodiya Label. Even though they are both recordings of the same work, this reissue on Praga has an audience overdubbed onto a studio recording to make it sound 'live'. There are coughs/scrapes/and even a final applause tacked onto the end of the recording. I have listened to both recordings side by side and determined that this is the case. There is not a hint of a live audience in the Melodiya version and the timings are exactly the same (when played at the same time). I'm amazed that this went on so long unnoticed and hope that you, the buyer, are aware."
2,Not at all like Busiek's more sophisticated works.,"I'm a fan of Kurt Busiek, but I found this book to fall way below the (high) standards he set with the ""Astro City"" series. Maybe he was just aiming for a pre-adolescent audience. In fact, it might be an OK kid's story, but, if you are a more ""mature reader"", I suggest that you pass it up."
2,The manga is better. Bad sound.,"I am a great admirer of animation. I can also see when it just isn't enough. Quality over qantity was what they were going for. The comic book seris of GTO was amazing. Fast paced, great drawings, hysterical. I had waited years for the animated version to arrive here. During its transition onto the screen something was lost. The live action version that aired in japan was at times more entertaining. Boring. I recommend the comic. Another thing that really bothered me was the lack of dolby sound! I don't think im asking too much. Maybe my expectations were too high."
5,"He's not an ordinary man, he's GTO!","When I first got introduced to GTO, I was thinking it was going to be a very serious school-type drama/action anime series. When I watched the first volume, I was shockingly surprised at how funny the show is! There's some very good humor in there, and the wild takes and extreme closeups of Onizuka are just wacky. Follow Onizuka in his preliminary journey toward becoming the best teacher in Japan. A wonderful start to a wonderful series."
5,I wish I could give 5 1/2 stars,"I have seen volumes 1-4 of GTO and I am officially addicted. I love Onizuka!! Any anime fan that wants to just have fun and learn a lesson or two from a really good teacher should watch this series. Besides the cool name GTO, there's a cool lesson to be learned at the end of every episode.You have got to watch this series. I want to see more Onizuka!!"
4,"Listen Closely, GTO Fans!","If you thought the anime was funny, you should know it was made more ""TV Friendly"" than the manga. The books are easy to find and are much cheaper, and the comedy is MUCH funnier. There are instances in which you must throw the book on the floor and laugh your... off for a few minutes before you pick it back up.The DVD's are great, but the special features were bland. I did enjoy the spot-on voice acting and the actors (Onizuka is played by the same guy who plays Spike on Cowboy Bebop, and Tom, the robot host of Toonami). A great buy!"
2,"Great interface & features, but quality issues","I love all of the features, great ease of use. But the inputs keep failing... after returning two models I'm moving on to an alternative manufacturer in hopes of better component quality."
3,Buyer's remorse but I deal with it.,"You get what you paid for is what comes to mind with this unit so I take full responsibility for my purchase. Sound, looks, ease of use on this unit are all very nice but there is an issue regarding the HDMI connection and it's not about the video-only pass-thru but rather the HDMI ""handshake"". It does not like the HDMI connection to a Playstation 3. Video ""flashes"" and blank video for 3 to 5 seconds is common. I've resolved this by directly making the connection from the PS3 to my Samsung LN52A650 and a separate optical connection from the PS3 to the receiver.My whole goal was to have everything switch through the 1017TXV but now, I have a big pile of remotes that I use to switch from watching Bluray DVD or playing games to watching cable.If I had a do over, I would pay extra for PS3 compatibility and true HDMI connection and upscaling to eliminate the doubling up of HDMI and audio connections."
2,Overly complex and disappointing,Not only is this thing too complex and fails to support the newer codecs but it doesn't support sound via HDMI. I learned this the hard way when trying to setup my 360 and PS3 to output video/sound via HDMI to the receiver.
5,Great Value A/V Receiver,"Excellence in A/V receivers is Pioneer ..........PERIOD!!! All the features for a reasonable cost and pass through 3D to boot! Have owned now for over six months and purchased a new 60"" 3D Plasma (60PZ550 LG) the Pioneer works perfect with it!"
4,Best receiver I've had yet,"Pros:Lots of options, you can actually run a 5.1 set up with 2 speakers playing on each of the front channels for some serious power if you need it. There is also full 7.1 preamp inputs and preamp outputs if you want to run your own seprate amplifiers. Cool remote too.Cons:The cross-over freaqency (the frequency that it starts sending audio to the sub instead of the speakers) only has a few settings, the lowest of which is 80Hz, which is a major downside for me because i have a weak subwoofer but good mains that go all the way down to 34Hz. The binding posts for the speaker wires are also a pain to get tighetended down well because they are almost totally smooth, so you have to use pliers to get them tight enough to keep your wires from falling out the first time you touch them. The remote uses a pre-programed system which lacks the codes for many, many devices including JVC cd players, and olevia tv's, so it really is only good for controlling itself for me."
3,luke warm..,"If you like it hot then this book aint for you. Primarily, it is Armitage's writing style which is a little turn off. If you have read other research papers by Armitage then you'd know what I'm talking about. I had to read a lot of those during my thesis work.Another reason for being luke warm is that QoS is a little vague topic to write about. Comparable works that I've read are: 'Quality of Service' by Ferguson and 'Supporting Service level agreements in IP networks' by Verma.This book touches upon a lot of different current topics in networking such as DiffServ, Inteserv, MPLS etc without going into too much detail.Unless you have practically worked on either developing or configuring QoS in routers, you'd have a hard time grasping some of the concepts because they might seem little too abstract at times. If you understand link coloring, CoS, constraint based routing and how routers (such as Juniper) actually implement it, then this book will make more sense."
2,Elvis: The Final Chapter,I thought this dvd would be a good purchase but I was disappointed in the contents. Many things were repeated throughout the dvd. People kept saying the same things with maybe a few extra words during each of the sub topics. Not one that I could highly recommend.
2,Good for fair weather living,"I've owned 3 of these units. The overall handle and feel of the product is great. The immediate ability to change the spray setting is one of the easiest of all nozzles. This is probably attributed to the plastic construction and low friction. The quick-disconnect also is the major reason for the initial purchase. This allows water to run without having to completely unscrew the nozzle - super convenient.However, all praise stops here. When cold weather hits - the plastic construction of the handle literally breaks. The little lockout lever snapped off and eventually the actual rear handle broke. So, if you live in cool climates and expect to drop the nozzle and hose, this is basically a disposable unit - no wonder they have the quick disconnect!"
1,Ouch!,Really it's as scary as it looks here(but that's part of the attraction isn't it?)& my significant other did not appreciate this romantic surprise as I had hoped. Bummer. Proceed with caution.
3,Date Line: Canada,"I read this after NOW recommended it. It's a quick read, and a pretty funny book if you're between, say, 25-35 and childless. You also probably need to be Canadian, and be either spectacularly directionless in life or on good terms with someone else who is. (If you don't qualify under any of these counts, you'll probably find the self-absorbed narrator's choices in life somewhat bewildering.)It didn't change my life, but I laughed out loud at a few well-placed observations and character foibles."
4,southwest anasazi archeological adventure,This is an easy read with adequate background information to give you some insight to the mysteries of the Anasazi. Personal conflicts mixed with modern day Indiana Jonesish thrills make for a compelling read. 4.5 stars out of 5.
5,read it twice,"I read Thunderhead a few years ago, however, I lost the novel in a recent move. I bought it again and spent two days reading it again. Great plot and wonderful writing."
4,Theme Park,"Like being at a theme park. Some of the chapters, like the rides at an amusement park, are better than others.....but your guaranteed to finish with a smile"
5,Action Packed!,This book was wonderful. It contains some of the characters you've grown to love but was very suspenseful and full of great twists and turns.
5,Good research + suspense = a winner!,"Preston and Childs really did their research preparing this book, which deals with a mission to discover the lost city of Quivira, the mythical ""city of gold"" searched for by the Spaniards. Quivira is supposedly an Anasazi city and Nora Kelly - who is leading the expedition based upon a letter she received from her long-dead father, written 16 years before - is certain she can find it. Among a large supporting cast is Bill Smithback, well-known from earlier books in the series including ""The Relic"" and ""Reliquary."" There seem to be people set against her finding Quivira, as several attempts are made on her life.I don't wish to discuss too much of the plot here; however, this is a truly fascinating book for those who are interested in the Anasazi, suspense and horror fans, and fans of Preston and Childs particular writing."
5,For the love of adventure,"Follow a 16-year-old lead to a mystical trail in the US Southwest and find yourself a mummy, treasures and a curse.If you enjoy classic adventure, archeological digs and strong characters, you will enjoy this book. With a mild step into the paranormal, Indian myth is briefly touched on. However, it stays true to the genre and sports some great bravery, minus the Indiana Jones antics. It's well written. Te characters are well-developed and it's definitely a page-turner.If you have read other novels by Child and Preston and aren't sure if you will enjoy this without the quirky and beloved Pendergast, I reassure you that you will.You're thinking about it. Go on, click the button. You want to read it. You'll be glad you did."
3,I expected more...,"While the premise for the story was excellent, the story didn't live up to expectations. After having read The Reliquary by these authors -- which I thought was excellent -- I expected a better story than what I read. Don't get me wrong, the story is good and it does hold your interest, but I know the authors can do better. Also, Subterranean by James Rollins -- another book involving cave explorations -- is a very hard book to top and I happened to read Rollins' book first. I'd still recommend Thunderhead, but as a book checked out from the library."
4,kinda late in reading thunderhead...,"and i'm really glad i finally got around to reading it!what a ride! i really enjoyed thunderhead!it's a smart, chilling, scary, and thoughtful story, with a dash of humor tossed it!highy recommended!happy reading!"
4,Another winner from a great team of writers,"Nora Kelly, the daughter of a famous and long-lost archeologist, finds a letter from her father and sets on a adventure expedition to find the fabled Lost City of Gold in the Utah region. She brings with her a group of experts and unraveles mystery after mystery, danger, death, ancient curses, betrayal and evil awaiting her. Reading like a great Indiana Jones adventure, this novels delivers with action. The mystery surrounding the ancient city is slowly revealed with each chapter. Anoher winner from a great team of writers."
5,COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!!!,Definately one of Preston's & Child's best. I wish it had gone on longer. You felt like you were there in the city with Nora and everyone else. It was so real. Can't wait for the next one!
4,"Great airplane reading, if you don't have to work!","If you like Crichton, you will love Preston and Child. They combine excellent suspense with fairly interesting and original scientific or historical mystery. In their immediately previous book, Riptide, we learned a lot about the architecture of cathedrals and the technology of excavation and drilling. In Thunderhead, we learn something about lost cultures of the American southwest, the geophysical dynamics of the slot canyon country of southwestern Utah, the technique and philosophy of archeology, and the characteristics of various poisonous flora. Their plots move along very suspensefully, and I found myself staying up until all hours to finish the novel. Character development is minimal. So if that is what you are looking for, read Jane Austin or the Bronte sisters. If you can stay awake."
4,Engaging and fast-paced,"As a lifelong aficionado of the Southwestern US and having sought out many of its lost, secret and hidden spaces, I picked up this book after reading the synopsis on the back, and wasn't disappointed. The authors describe and develop a credible landscape to the northwest of Lake Powell (that the USGS maps of the region may suggest but don't entirely confirm...) and present a relatively well-researched treatise of the Skinwalker mythology (or is it?) of the local tribes. Most intriguing was the eponymous 'Thunderhead', which indeed served as this page-turner's protagonist, and the plot developed much as a metaphorical thunderhead, building to its zenith, then letting loose its wrath. All in all, I'd say it was well worth the price of a paperback."
5,Another great Preston and Child's story,"Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child keep me coming back for more. They have never disappointed me with any of their books. Thunderhead is great however, Riptide remains my favorite. That being said, I'm going in for another Preston and Child's book."
4,Thunderhead,I ordered this book accidentally but I love anything Preston and Childs's write so it wasn't a very big mistake.
4,Preston & Child,"I have enjoyed everyone of Preston and Child's books, especially because of Agent Pendergast. But all of their characters are very believable."
3,More archaeology than thrills,"Although the book was published 9 years back, I got to read this only now.I have read many other books by the same authors. This book does not rate so high. I actually wanted to give 3 and a half stars - I think Amazon should make that possible by slightly modifying the star rating system - its not too difficult.The book rests on a framework of archaeological and anthropological facts (and fiction) regarding the Anasazi indians. And this alone makes up for interesting reading. The rest of story is not much and one can figure out where it is going. Lacks real suspense. Preston and Child are solid writers. But the story and the cast is not so solid. Needed more weaving on a solid framework."
4,Pretty Good,"I like the Relic and Reliquary, so I had to check this one out as well. The premise of the story is a mysterious letter from a dead father arrives to his daughter. The letter decribes how he has discoverd the lost Anasazi city of Quivera and she sets out to find it. The trip is full of danger and to make things worse the are being attacked by skinwalkers. I was entertained not as much as the Relic but still pretty good."
4,Great read... on one of my favorite subjects!,"The Myth & History of the Anasazi, is interestingly explored in this book. I lived in that part of the west for 7 years, & have made a small study of these fasinating peoples. So I think I judge anything on this subject very strictly. Child & Preston have done a wonderful, exciting, scary book on the subject. I found it fast paced, & hard to put down."
4,A good read - and no Relic Clone,"I read this because I loved all the previous books by the authors. Given the blurb I was concerned that the book would be a copy of the story from the Relic, which it most definately was not. While the characters were slightly cartoonish, I was left guessing for quite awhile just what was going on and who was involved. The setting was great. If you are interested in the Anasazi or the Southwest, you should find it entertaining."
4,These two guys are T-RIFIC story tellers !!,"I've read all the novels written by Preston & Child (Relic, Mount Dragon, Reliquary & Riptide).This one is another page turner. It combines archaeology, a little natural history, some very vivid descriptions of the Utah ""BADLANDS"" and plenty of gooseflesh suspense. I,m hooked on these two. Can't wait for their next bestseller. Hurry up guys !!!"
2,I expected more.,"I was disappointed in this book. Yes it does take the reader to a different place, but the characters are flat and predictable. There were ample opportunities to develop the characters but none of them ever reached me...I really never cared about any of them. The text itself had more of a ""now they did this, this and this"" feel to it rather than a descriptive narrative that enriches the reader's imagination and images."
2,"Ugh, my least favorite.",I've read all of the Preston/Child books and I've loved them all. . . except this one. I'm over halfway finished with the book and I'm thinking of putting it down. It's just boring. Read one of their other books.
3,"Not as good as some of their others, but pretty good withal.","In these days of the ability to see people and trucks on the ground using cameras in orbit, I have a good deal of trouble with the concept of Lost Cities, even ones tucked away in shadowy places. Add in the Dreadful Disease, and there's a bad case of disbelief here. Still, these two always write well, and I will continue to purchase their books as soon as they are available in paperback. I have to say that RELIC remains my favorite, though I found RELIQUARY (the sequel to it) nauseating.I do think that the scene wherein the protagonist finds her father's body is very well done--so many times, such healing never takes place in real life."
2,Are archaeologists really this dumb?,I've seen too many PBS specials to fall for Gold fevered professional archaeologists -- supposedly the best in their fields. The plot is strait out of Scooby-Doo. Even though I read the whole thing and couldn't put it down -- of course I was stuck on a 14 hour flight to Tokyo -- I found the book completely dissatisfying.
2,Terrible,"This is the first book by this author that I have not really liked. Not only did it take a long time for the book to get interesting, but just about the time it did they started talking about witchcraft and curses. Not my cup of tea guys."
3,Good for background into Pendergast characters,"My husband doesn't read fiction all that often, so when he told me I had to read these 2 authors (Preston & Child) who collaborated on several books I had to check them out. This was my 2nd book by them (my first being ""Riptide"" [5 stars]) and while the story was ok... I wasn't so sure I'd be venturing further into the Preston and Child realm of novels. However, 7 Preston & Child books in... and I'm now glad that I read THUNDERHEAD. There are a few characters in this story that you come to run into time and time again in their books and it definitely gave me a very fun backstory into who they are. As opposed to meeting them for the first time and not being familiar with a previous ""ordeal"" that they had gone through. I recommend this book to people who are looking for a little back story to Nora and Smithback.... but not really to anyone who isn't going to commit to Preston & Child for a few more books, at least."
4,Great book!,The owner of a used book shop got me started on the Preston/Child books and I have now read all of them. I think they are all great reads. Can't wait to get the new one. I'm now reading the books written individually and will be let down when I am finished with all of them. Do they have a web site or blog where I can keep up with future books?
3,Not as good as The Ice limit,"A decent read, but it was really too long and the character development left something to be desired. The climax raised my pulse a little but not like I was hoping after reading the authors' tremendous The Ice Limit. The sense of setting was quite good at least. All in all an average thriller, can't really recommend it. Read the Ice Limit!"
2,KIDS tale,"I read the Readers Digest, Select Editions version of Thunderhead which is a mere 137 pages and I still found myself skipping pages out of boredom. This story is better suited for children."
4,Informative and Fun,"Nora Kelly is an archeologist who has spent her life in the shadow of her missing father's dreams. Her dad disappeared while on a mission to find an ancient abandoned Native American city. Nora stumbles across a letter from her father in the mail one day that was dated 16 years earlier. She is forced to wonder, did he ever find the ancient city of Quivira and is he still alive?? Nora manages to get an expedition funded that will follow in her father's footsteps through the canyons of Utah. What she does not know is that evil is following her and her group and will pose more of a threat than anyone could ever imagine.This book is another great installment from Preston and Child. The writing is fast paced and fun and the underlying information about the Anasazi tribe and the archeology lends credence to the tale. Archeology buffs and fans of the thriller genere alike will enjoy this novel."
4,Dunder Head,"I ripped right through this page turner, but it was very formulaic and had some weak points. First, the 'hero' is an anal-retentive selfish fool. The 'romances' in the book are contrived and lead nowhere. The premise that a bunch of archeologists would get gold fever was unnecessary and made the book seem dumber. The 'flash flood' would have gone in the direction of the lake, but due to a plot device, it went backwards to force the 'hero' back to the camp. Otherwise, the venue is pretty original and the pacing is good. I sort of liked it."
5,Second only to RELIC,I've read all of the books written by the team of Lincoln and Child. And by far RELIC is their best. Thunderhead is right there hanging with RELIC. I could not put Thunderhead down. The characters are ones you can believe and care about. Even old Smithback returns from RELIC to play a large role in Thunderhead. This story mixes south west archaeology with total terror in a way that you will not soon forget. An expedition to find Coronado's legendary Lost City of Gold turns into a fight to survive. Pick up this book and I promise you wont be able to put it down until you read the last line.
5,Great read!,"Like other Preston & Childs books that I've read, this one is fascinating and quirky. If you like Southwestern archaeology and mysteries, this will get you hooked in a hurry."
3,Not for animal lovers.,"An archaeologist working a low-pay and precarious university job has a frightening experience at a remote piece of property and discovers a letter written by her father, a famous archaeologist who disappeared years before--a letter in which he claimed to have discovered a fabulous lost city. Sounds like great fun, doesn't it? Well, it should have been but somehow it all seemed a little flat to me. The grand expedition to look for the lost city and to redeem her father's reputation is filled with characters that seem too cardboard-y, situations that seem too far over the top and behavior that doesn't always make much sense. The book also contains far more gore than I would have expected and much of it seemed very gratuitous. In particular I would warn you to skip this book if you are an animal lover because not all of the gratuitous gore was human. A real disappointment from a writing duo whose books I usually enjoy."
4,It's hard to put down,"I read Thunderhead in two days. These guys get better with each book. This one is based on solid research, great visual writing and a well developed, fast paced, edge of your seat story. The characters are well developed for the most part, and interesting and they are not entirely predictable.My only objection is the almost too graphic descriptions of animals being killed...I didn't mind the graphic descriptions of people being killed, but the animals got to me. But...read it! IT's worth the trip."
4,Great Book! Modern Indy-Style Adventure,"I had never read Preston or Child's books before, but this one has left me clammoring for more! The writing style is reminicient of Chricton, with a great mix of dialogue and technical information. This book is a great thriller and will have you up late to find out what lurks in the canyons!"
2,not as pictured,I bought this pendant assuming it would arrive as pictured. It does not have a bail - only a ring which is facing the opposite direction of the ring pictured. It is much smaller than I expected. I am not pleased.
5,Doesn't leak!,You never pay much attention to stuff like hose connectors - until you notice that the cheap ones leak all over you when you water.Glad I spent a bit more money to get higher quality connectors that work well and last a long time and DON'T LEAK!
5,Good stuff!,Several years ago I purchased a set of these attachments and am very glad to have found them on line. They're so very handy and durable. Makes using the hose and attachments very easy.
3,Convenience with questionable durability,"Quick release systems are very convenient. We're sold on that type of functionality. And while these particular adapters work very well in terms of leaking, ease of use, etc. I think the durability is somewhat questionable.We have this installed on a hose end that then attaches to a jet spray head. During watering, we pulled/yanked on the jet spray head to free more hose. Immediately the adapter broke right in the middle at the area where the plastic is narrowest but begins to widen.I'm not sure these are worthwhile in the long term, but because this happened within the 30-day return window, Amazon overnighted a set of new adapters to us. There's a reason Amazon is amazing. I also ordered an additional package of them to have as spares.At less than $3.00 each, these items aren't expensive, but if they keep breaking as often and as easily as the last one, I don't think it's a long term solution and I'll consider changing quick release connector systems."
1,Beware - Not US Threads,"I have used Gardena for 35 years and it is the only way to go. Anybody who does not use quick connect for their hoses is simply struggling for no reason. Even in AZ they stand up to the sun although if you drop the hoses on a concrete surface they do crack as they become a little brittle.Not generally known is that Gardena make 2 types of accessory adapters - gray as a universal (European thread) and orange as the US thread. Having come from outside the USA I have both. The gray thread works in the USA but leaks a little and it drives me nuts as it drips while using various sprayers and nozzles.This set comes with gray adapters and being sold by Amazon to US customers should have the correct adapters. The correct item is a Gardena 2922 to be found at [...]Not sure where to find the orange ones, but be aware. Amazon should get it right. I give Gardena 5 stars, but this pack is incorrect and I mark it down .. a lot."
1,save your $$$$$$,"I read at least 2 books a week, and this was by far one the worst I have read I usually read an entire book & give it a shot....this one I gave 3/4 then said forget it! sorry Sheryl Woods but they all sound the same....."
4,First in a great new series!,"One of the perks about this book is that we're going to see the characters again. And they are certainly worth visiting again and again.There's Daisy, who is the focus of this book. She takes in an orphan she finds hotwiring her car. But an uncle is found in Washington, D.C. (A Yankee!!) and her hopes of adopting him are in doubt.Add 2 overprotective brothers and then best of all, Daisy's father, King (whose nickname should give you a clue) and you have a fun read.If you like Nora Roberts, you will also like Sherryl Woods and this new series."
3,A little off on the characterization.,"Daisy adopts Tommy, a boy who had been in and out of foster care since he could remember. She has a lot of love to give the boy, but it seems the whole town is against him until the boy's uncle shows up. Tommy's uncle is Walker Ames, a former Washington cop who was more concerned with career than family. Walker wants to prove himself once again as a family man, but can he redeem himself in Daisy's eyes, or, more importantly, Tommy's? Though the family relationships are important in this book, they're slow to develop here. We don't get to see enough of the conflict between Daisy and Walker which should to be crucial to this book. Instead, we see more of the supporting characters, which give us more to be concerned with appearances rather than family relationships."
3,Okay nozzle,"This nozzle is okay, but the knob to hold the position of the handle doesn't work that well. There should be more choices on the head as well since this product is high-priced. If you want a nozzle like this, buy a similar product made by Nelson (also sold here at amazon)."
4,Better than most on market,"This nozzle is better than most available on market today. It is lightweight and the trigger does not require brute force. I use it to wash my car and water my plants in pots and garden.On the downside, because it is made of lightweight plastic, it is not durable. On the average, it lasts about a year. Warranty service on the product is below average.The product is well designed by a German company, but since Melnor took over the US distribution, they have discouraged customer service for this product so Melnor can push their branded nozzles which are heavy and difficult to operate."
5,Great Information Every Parent and Educator's Library,"A School for Every Child is a well-written, informative guide to every type of education offered to the public. It is a must for parents to explore various types of educational institutions and opportunities that are available to meet the vast array of learning styles of children. Educators will appreciate the descriptions and statistical research included for each school. I especially enjoyed the chapters on charter schools and Christian schools."
4,I loved this book,"Hi, my name is kylie and this book was awesome. in school we had to do it for a literature fair for gade 7's and i did this bookk because i am framilia with this author and her work. i love the spoine tingling action."
5,Great book! Couldn't put down!,"This was the second book by Richie Tankersley Cusick that I have read.....the other was Starstruck(another GREAT book!). I loved it! It was a great book that I couldn't put down! Her style of writing is great, and the ideas she uses are truelly amazing! I would recommned that EVERYONE read this book!"
1,The House Next Door,"This novel tricked us. We expected an adult mystery novel, but instead it was much more like what a teen would enjoy. Very predictable and because of that, boring and a waste of time."
2,i dont find it good,i just bought the book nad i cant get into it at all.. i only fin it iteresting in some parts but the spooky ghost stuff is not for me.... i honestly thought it was a waste of money and very good!!!!
3,Interesting But Lacking,"Emma and Charlie Donovan share a lot of things. Their birthday for one, CD's, and dreams. On a dare, Emma bets Charlie that she can spend a night alone in the house next door. Which is, supposedly haunted. After one night in the house Emma begins having strange dreams, and living the life of a girl who lived in the house, who had the same name and age as Emma. Now her life is spinning out of control. While other girls her age are planning their outfits for the school dance, Emma is trying to rid her mind of a spirit and a love from 100 years ago.While this book was very good at times it lacked in certain areas. I recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of the Buffy the Vampire slayer book series. Or anyone interested in the paranormal."
3,"Decent ghost story, but that's about it.","Time travel romances aren't my favorite because they generally aren't too happy of endings, of which I'm a sucker for. However lately I've been more interested in them and was anxious to give this book a try. The verdict? Not so much. It was REALLY hard to get through the first half of the book, it literally took me days, but I kept pushing. I don't regret that I did as it was an interesting enough ghost story, but if you're looking for a good time travel romance like I was, check out ""The Splendor Falls"". Such a beautiful book with amazing writing and I think I'm going to have a hard time finding one that compares."
5,"A Book of Romance, Mystery, Ghosts, and A Bit of Humore","This book is about a girl named Emma who tries to change the past. This book is a really great read and if you like romance with your suspense, this book is for you. Please try it. Also try to find other Richie Tankersley Cusick books. The book are really good for people who like suspense and romance in one."
5,This is my lawn mower,"I live in an area that uses rocks as landscaping instead of grass. Once a week I use my pistol power sprayer with weed killer to keep the rocks clean of grass. Also works great with bug spray. I almost died when I had a hard time finding a replacement sprayer, I ordered two and gave my son one. I love my Cepia sprayer, makes the job faster and easier, I wish more stores would care this product on the shelf. I have had this product for about 3 years and all my neighbors have at least 2 units, we all love it."
2,pistol power sprayer,"This product lasted a very short period of time , afterwitch it stopped pumping I would not recommend purchasing it"
1,A Waste of Money,"The sprayer never actually works as advertised. It does spray, but the spray versus stream settings are completely ineffective. And the effective usable lifetime of this product is measured in minutes, not hours, days, weeks, or months. I've owned four of them and the result is the same each time. Nice idea, if only it worked."
2,Worked great while it lasted!,Used this product for about a year and it just stopped working. It was great while it worked but didn't last as long as I thought it should!
1,Don't buy it!,"This product is garbage. As noted in other reviews, it didn't last a season. Was nice while It worked, so I gave it one star, but the power sprayer died after maybe 4 uses over less than a year. HD wouldn't take it back (can't really blame them) and I have yet to be ""recontacted"" from the ""800"" number for customer service, where you have to leave a message.... Just buy a hand pump unit."
3,The Miyu Saga Continues,"""Mystery"" contains five episodes: a great deal for the price. However, these episodes are a bit predictable.Episode 12 - ""Garden of Crying Reeds"" - The saddest of them all, absolutely painful to watch. If you are a cat lover, I recommend skipping this one.Episodes 13 & 14: ""Light of the Sea, Pts. I & II"" The best two on this disc. A mystery unfolds as Larva is compelled to leave Miyu's side for a reason he cannot name. Miyu goes after her beloved companion. These episodes tell the story of Larva's past, and how he and Miyu met.Episode 15: ""Dream of the Mermaid"" - This mermaid is so pretty to look at, but when are mermaids ever good? So you know what will happen, but when it does, it still scared me. Animation is so exceptional in ""Mermaid.""Episode 16: ""Woman Priest"" - A fine Chinese woman priest comes to Japan on a revenge mission, and runs into Miyu.A final note. Watch this DVD in a darkened room, because the animation is so dark that you cannot see it in a sunny room."
1,Waste of Money,"Don't waste your hard earned pesos on this one. The content and the designs of this book are unbearably corny. The quality of typography is embarrassing. There are so many inconsistencies in this book that it makes you believe that it was not proof-read before publication. If you are looking for a design book to buy, get ""Soak Wash Rinse Spin."""
4,A perfect example of club design infecting modern ad work.,"Nice collect of design work from a well respected, very talented designer. Would have appreciated a little more narrative becuase it is always interesting when you can tap into a creative's skull. However KM's work speaks volumes, alone."
2,Not to bad but...,"I picked up a copy about a month ago, I thought it was pretty cool, but he uses alot of the same elements in his design work. Actually he over uses them. To those that already blew their money on it, look at the designs, and count how many times he uses the same images over and over.The layout is ok, some pages make me feel ill.What made me laugh was the spelling on the cover. ""Licence to design"", this guy neds a ""LICENSE"" to go back to school and learn to spell. I mean Licence is kind of a correct way of spelling it, but its uncommon. But hes KM7-Design Agent, so he has to be uncommon. 99% ego, .5% imagination .5% human.Honestly, his work isn`t impressive at all.Shapes with manipulated images really isn`t that technical.Not to meantion he uses alot of dingbats."
2,an okay book for starters,"nothing good about this book unless you love to stare at images of strange techno-babble mixed with lots of colorful shapes and the whole ""graffitti-like"" spread of design. it's more of a flip through graphic book than anything to really inspire."
4,Better than I expected,"Although JAK is one of my very favorite authors, I almost didn't get this book because of the reviews. However, since JAK has never let me down, I went ahead. Yes, the 2 stories are not her best, but I still found them engaging- I read the whole book in basically one sitting. They were not quite a humorous as some of her others, but they moved at a brisk pace. I found Dangerous Magic facinating as it seemed to foretell JAK's own other word stories, as well as bits and pieces of some of her other contemporary. Although Wade was unbelievably overbearing, he had a reason; and Elissa was certainly not your average, everyday woman. Affair of Honor seemed to be pretty typical - Ryder had a bit of haunting past, and Brenna certainly was dealing with her own issues. JAK's familiarity with academic environment was evident in this story. Personally, I loved the not too obvious psychological insights, the frank way the guys went after what they wanted, and how the women held their own."
1,"Hard to believe it was JAK, even then","For those of us old enough (alas) to remember the '80's, these old novels are almost believable. Bad, but believable. For anyone lucky enough to have been too young for the '80's, you won't understand them at all. And that's a dang fine thing. In the words of the immortal Dorothy Parker, ""This is not a book to be tossed aside lightly. Rather, it should be flung with great force."""
1,Surprise!!,I was surprised at what I received for the money that I spent. The sprayer is just not worth the money paid. The head is not adjustable. My old unit cost half as much an is still a better sprayer with several stream adjustments.
3,Good But Others Better,"I've tested a bunch of watering tools and this one rates pretty well. But, finally settled on The ""Waterquick"" which actually does what it claims. It puts down maximum water without any blowback of dirt or debris. Also it protects fragile foliage from water damage. It's a new, hard to find tool locally but should be easily found online thru search engines."
4,GARDENA 36949-8 PULSE SPRAYER PERFORMANCE,"THE GARDENA 36949-8 PULSE SPRAYER IS AN EXCELLENT TOOL, AS I, HAVE TWO UNITS. ALL GARDENA PRODUCTS HAVE PERFORMED EXCELLENT FOR ME."
4,Good deal for the price,"This DVD looks to be the same show that A&E aired as their biography of Bruce Lee (1 hour version). The quality of the transfer is good - both picture and sound - but not great.Two things that annoyed me are:1) Several motion clips and stills were used over and over, detracting from the generally good quality of the production and2) The ""extras"" consist solely of several trailers for martial arts movies, some of which Bruce Lee had nothing to do with.Still, for ten bucks, it's a good deal."
3,Not bad....,"I picked this up very very cheap in a supermarket, and I know why now.The main part of the DVD is a documentary which is quite interesting but really has nothing new to say about Bruce Lee. It contains a lot of stock footage which I have seen before.For what I paid (1 in the UK!), and baring in mind I actually don't own any other Bruce Lee documentaries, this is fine. If it costs more than that and you already have documentaries about Bruce Lee its probably not worth buying."
5,Excellent Brush!,"My mom bought me my first Fast Flo 25 years ago and I've been using the brush ever since. I have long, thick, naturally curly hair and have difficulty finding brushes that go through my hair easily. This one has never failed me. No static either. I had someone ask me recently how I take care of my hair as long as it is and I told her about this brush. Excellent brush!"
5,Best brush on the market!!,This brush is awesome..better than my $65.00 brush....I was so happy to finally find it again.
2,its a brush,its winter and usually my hair has static and the brush is good for normal use and doesnt minimize static let alone eliminate it.
2,Check your system before buying,"The customer images are more accurate than the main image on the page for this product. This vertical stand has a circular base with a screw in the middle, and can only be used with the SCPH-70000 series of the slim PS2. Later models, such as the SCPH-9000 series, do not have a hole for the screw and cannot be used with this stand.Check to ensure your system's compatibility before buying this product."
1,PS 2 slim slimmer? why...,the vertical stand is wonderfull... but why? you can do this with 2 useless dvd cases and some duck tape... I put my PS slim vertically and it helps but why waste the time buying the product? I bought it just for kicks... literally.
1,Sony Rules!,"The idea of a vertical stand is pure genius! I am so enthralled that I am making my own stand with scrap pig iron and a mig welder. I am also going to make stands for my microwave,my electric toothbrush and my houseplants. True they will not be sleek black plastic but they will be magnetized, rugged and prone to rust! I'm also going to make my own memory cards from old sneakers and twine as that is another item yhat this a la carte system does not include. Carry on Sony! XBox has nothing on you!Except of course a system with a huge hard drive and a substantial unit all included at no extra cost."
2,"Missing ""Duncan"" quality",Bought this for my son. Yo-yo is unbalanced because of the mechanism. May be okay for SUPER beginners. Any beginning kid with a bit of experience or for an older beginning preteen may be better off with a different yo-yo. I gave it 2 stars instead of one because you can actually remove the mechanism (do a google search) and it becomes a better yo-yo for someone that is learning to do tricks.
1,Auto return?,"Well the title says AUTO RETURN, so I bought one for my 4 year old and , well it doesnt return ! Maybe I mis-understood the title but this YoYo is not auto return!"
1,Disappointment,"This yoyo is advertised as auto return. Only auto return if you can use a yoyo, it is simply a string. I feel that the description was misleading. Not recommended for 5 year old."
3,Not much action or charismatic acting,"Although this is a production of a company that usually produces very fine fast moving action films, this is not one of them. It has typical fights between fellow soldiers, and none of the action or acting in it is really exciting. The son of Chuck Norris and grandson of Robert Mitchum have the second and third lead roles, but they do not look or act like their relatives or have their charisma. The film does not use real names for organizations or countries. Thus, for instance, the UN is called IPF. The plot focuses on an IPF patrol that is destroyed by terrorist. A second patrol is sent to find them. All but the previously identified two, the lead actor, a woman, and an Arab guide are killed. The five soon work out that the terrorists have a nuclear weapon and they go against enormous odds of men and equipment to stop the blast and kill the terrorists."
1,Poor Thailand,"There are many books about sex, drugs , and exotic customs in Thailand, but this one hits the bottom with sleaze and attitude. Mr. Quartermaine mangages to insult the Thai people even when he is supposedly praising them. Definitely written from a sophomoric view of another culture."
3,Sleepless in Bangkok,"What a horrible and expensive paperback book. Still, I am the one who ordered it."
5,A cut above the average,"The book goes far beyond the trashy airport reads but by its number of pages, (310) it gives a reader a full entertainment value to any long flight as it simply is a 'no-put-down!'. The action, the politics, the revenge and the 'life experiences' could only have been experienced by Quartermaine himself to be able to write so vividly. For anyone having travelled to Bangkok or spent any time here, they will know this is factual in the extreme. Unofficially banned in Thailand by the press and review status, one can read why. This has to become a collectors items."
2,"Good for a few sheets, then you have to pick out paper","It works well enough for receipts, but only about two at a time. If you take a piece of regular paper, you can usually get it through if you fold it.However, after shredding a few sheets, you'll find that there are bits of paper strips crumpled up and stuck at both ends. Then you have to unplug the thing and use a paperclip to pick out these pieces, which can take some time.If you intend on shredding a lot of paper, don't bother with this. If you only want to shred a bank statement every month or just receipts, go ahead, it's cheap.It works well to open envelopes, without getting stuck."
1,JUNK,You know I didnt expect much for the price but I did expect a product that worked. It cant handle the thinist paper without jamming up. Dont waste your money on this.
2,Weak,"It does not shred well, too little power, A4 sheets need to be folded in half and they are too thick to be processed. Price is Ok but I would have rather spent more and get something more useful."
2,Too intense for young children,I felt this movie was too intense for young children. I also thought some of the characters displayed some negative behaviors I did not think were appropriate for young ones.
4,First Vincent,"A must for Vincent enthusiasts. Very good book with alot of information. Lots of enjoyment and fun to read. I would recommend it to people who like old motorcycles, especially like me who owned one."
4,Works great,"I've been looking for this type of sprinkler for a long time. I had an old, old one until my husband ran over it with the lawn mower. Good stong construction, you can regulate the pressure in each sprinkler head making it nice for different shaped spots. Would purchase again."
2,Difficult to use,"This sprinkler sounds like a good product. It is made of metal, it is sturdy, and it has enough weight to stay put. But the first one I ordered was defective, with one stopped-up spray head, so it had to be returned for a replacement. The second one is difficult to adjust so the arms are in sync and turn evenly. It does seems to work reasonably well if the object is to spray a thin jet of water in as wide a radius as possible -- while you stand and watch it. Once your back is turned, it slows to a halt. If a fuller spray is desired for a smaller area, well, good luck. I've fiddled and fooled with this thing for some time now and cannot get it to do what I want. My newer, two-dollar plastic sprinkler from Wal Mart works just fine, though."
2,Very basic,"This book is very basic, providing very simple ideas regarding customer service. It has good topics, but the actual training materials are fairly boring and unengaging. In general, I would use it only for retail type business applications, and then only as a guide, not as your main resource."
4,Useful guidance - and not just for trainers!,"The importance of properly training your people to enable them to provide excellent customer service cannot be understated. How many of us have received poor customer service as a result of someone clearly not knowing what to do? This book provides some useful techniques and it is not limited to those who are actually training in the area. My only caution is that whilst you can make some ""quick and easy"" improvements when training customer service people, to achieve an on-going level of exceptional customer service requires a longer term commitment. That being said any improvement is a good improvement and this book can help.Simon HazeldineBestselling author of ""Bare Knuckle Customer Service"", ""Bare Knuckle Selling"" and ""Bare Knuckle Negotiating"""
2,Your service Amazon.com,I was surprized when I wanted to order 5 books and you would only sell 3. It did work out well. I went to Sams Club and found the book. It was a couple $$ higher than your price per book. But there was no shipping fee. With your shipping fee it made your price per book higher than Sams Club price. Thank you for getting me out to shop around.Don Terry
2,I Think I Wasted My Money,"In my opinion, I wasted my money buying this video. It seems to be mostly a series of interviews with Bigfoot enthusiasts. On the video Biscardi claimed that he was going to catch Bigfoot before this video came out. As far as I could tell the only thing this video did prove was that Biscardi's statement was just a brag."
5,Really good documentary about those who pursue hairy giants,Length:: 8:34 MinsThis is my Video Review of this product.
1,TERRIBLE video,"Formatted some most DVD or Blueray players cannot watch!!!!! Secondly, filmaker followed and interviewed complete idiots (with the exception of a noted anthropologists) Biscardi is a know hoaxer....thanks for wasting an hour of my life. Donated DVD to the girl scouts for pedophile training. DO NOT waste your money folks....."
1,Does NOT Fit the 7370/7373,I ordered this product when I had my Nokia 7370 and it did not fit into the port.
3,"Picture and tracklist do not tally.,","The tracklist here shown by Amazon does not relate to the version pictured, which was the first CD release for 'Live In Europe 1979'. Far from featuring 'extra tracks', this single-CD edition has 13 and dropped 'Who Needs Me?' from the 2LP vinyl version, undoubtedly for timing purposes. This edition, Castle Communications RAWCD30, is now deleted.So, musically it's five stars but due to that dropped track this edition gets three stars; the remastered and expanded version 2CD is the one to go for and I give that the full five stars."
1,Doesn't Stack,"I have 8 of these units and purchased them because of their supposed ability to stack. However, the stacking feature doesn't work. Linksys tech support was of no use. After several weeks of talking to them and their parent company (Cisco) I gave up. I've had these for a couple of years now and there still isn't a firmware revision for them. Apparently Linksys doesn't care about their commercial customers."
5,Classic Rock Reborn,"Probably the best of the new breed of classic rock-sounding new bands coming out of the UK. This album has it all. If you liked Zeppelin, Thin Lizzy, early Def Leppard, Foghat, etc. you'll really these guys. Great guitar licks, excellent song structure and phrasing if only a teeny bit unnecessarily self-indulgent in some places. The vocalist has some great pipes. I HIGHLY recommend this album to anyone who digs that 70's classic rock vibe, feel, and riff. These boys have it down and bring a freshness to the genre. These guys also seem to really love what they're playing! They do a cover of Aerosmith's ""Sweet Emotion"" that accurately captures the spirit of the song. Fantastic! Hopefully we'll see big things from them in the years ahead. Other new classic rock bands to check out: Tokyo Dragons, Wolfmother & Starsailor."
5,Great Pocket Guide,"If you're interested in stars and the sky, this simple little guide is great to take along on trips. Easy for adults and kids to follow and understand, and takes no space to carry. Not in depth, but a great overview of the skies."
5,Should be on the shelf of every New Englander,"""Alas! That one should ever attempt to retouch the time-faded by beautiful pictures that the memory holds.""I found this on the shelf at a used-book store in Western Maryland. When I want to be transported back to the ""Fields and Woods"" of New England, I pick this up and read a few pages. The book was written over 100 years ago, but one can still picture the grouse taking flight or the colored leaves on the forest floor. This book should be on the shelf of every home-sick New Englander."
2,Falls off my face.,The magnet is very weak and the goggles fall off my face about five seconds after putting them on. This is hilarious but not practical.
2,Puts pressure on face under the eyes,They do look cool. Hard to store although it comes w/ a cloth/silk bag. Wish they just used a polarized lense instead of a colored lense. Since it doesn't sit on the bridge of your nose it puts pressure on your face under the eyes. I went running w/ it and my eyes started to hurt because of the pressure it puts on the bottom of your eyes. Feels like your eyes aren't getting blood or something. They did stay on. I adjusted them to maximum length but they still feel too tight.I ended up not using them.
5,"Great product, highly recommended","I got my pair of Clic Goggles because I was looking for a more comfortable pair of goggles for skiing because I thought the other ones were too big and left that mark on your face when you took them off. These goggles are everything I could have hoped for and more. They fit perfectly (even over my glasses) and never fall off even when I have fallen. Not only do they fit well but they are simply more ""cool"" than the other goggles out there. I recommended them to my friend and he know uses them when he rides his motorcycle and when he DJs at a local club here.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (and can't beat this price on Amazon!) NOT ONLY USEFUL BUT STYLISH AND COOL"
3,Not what I expected.,"As long as your head is a perfect shape for the stiff bows holding the goggles to your head you will be OK, otherwise they are a poor design. Magnet design is only a gimmick."
2,Smaller than average heads only...,"I purchased these but had to return them. while the molded strap is adjustable, it only opens up approx. 1"". The magnetic attachment worked well but if your head is 23.5"" or larger around - at the eyebrows, forget it, these will not fit you."
2,they fall apart at high speeds,"I bought the goggles and was excited by the look. They are kind of ""Riddick"" like. They had disappoiinting performance when I rode my jet ski at 65 mph and they flew off my face. They did float and so I found them and tried it a second time and same thing happened. I gave them to my daughter and she will try to wear them skiing. They definately are not for extreme sports. They are also too big for casual use as sun glasses."
1,So ugly!,"When I saw these on me in the mirror I literally felt like puking. There ARE only two sizes, small/m and large, and the large size is TOO large; it's for bobble heads. And the color is horrid, it's a really cheap greenish and blue look. I've seen literally ONE DOLLAR GLASSES that look better than this thing. Sickening.The orange small/m version was good though, at least the version from 2 years ago was."
1,Ridiculous Looking!,"I bought these for my dad for Christmas and they did not fit his head, they didn't even fit mine and I have an average size head. Another thing, they did not look cool at all, they were ridiculous looking, nothing like the Photoshopped pictures!"
1,won't buy,"I won't be buying these, because there is not enough public comments or even actual photos of people using these goggles. If you look closely on the example photos provided by amazon the people that supposingly wear these things, then you'll notice they aren't really wearing them its just drawn."
2,Very Particular Fit,"Like to ski with sunglasses on nice days, but have massive eye watering since LASIK surgery. Thought these might help cut down on wind effect. I wound up giving them to my brother because the fit is fairly specific. With no way to adjust the ""ear pieces"" - they never felt comfortable."
1,These goggles dont measure up!,"I ordered the regular size, they were to big, the smaller size? too small. neither one fit well but both did one thing well, hurt the area under my eyes. Buyer BEWARE!"
4,glasses,"my husband is a wheelchair user and loved these, said it keeps his eyes warm while driving down the street"
2,Could have been harder,I was excited by the themes of the book but was less excited once I read it. It could have been better. The stories were pretty standard as far a gay erotica goes. The sexual tension never really develops and it quickly dissolves into the mechanical hump and pump.
4,Long Spoon,Nice Spoon. Would be even better if it had a rubber handle at the end. I do a lot of sturring for my product.
3,Don't use in a plastic bucket,"Great as a spoon, no problems. Sturdy enough, nice and long and its obviously easy to sterilize.But for homebrewing:If you are stirring in a plastic bucket, this thing can start ""shaving"" little pieces of plastic off of the sides of your bucket (you'll see them, they'll float up to the top). I've stopped using this for homebrewing because of this. I got an old wooden spoon just as long which I am now using instead."
1,Never got it!,"I ordered it and waited for close to 4 weeks for it and it never showed up. There was a tracking number for it for UPS and it said they picked it up from the shipper but then it said out for delivery for more then 2-1/2 weeks. I finally gave up and contacted Amazon to say I never got it and then they gave me a credit for it. I think this might of been a UPS problem however I am giving Brewcraft a poor rating because they never contacted me, said they were sorry or explained what happened, very poor customer service from them, but ecellent customer service from AMAZON!"
5,Big silver spoon,I bought this for a friend so he could make some wine. He says is works well and it is exactly what he needed! It was a good buy and worth the money.
5,Gunsmoke;The premier episode,"Being a true Gunsmoke fan I have seen this video and can't say enough about it. John Waynes intro for James Arness is absolutly the truth,Jim is an excellent talent.The rest of the cast is so fantastic that you fall in love with each one of them,and wow what a living doll that Amanda Blake! If you don't have this one in your collection you should!"
3,3 stars when compared to later color program w/Festus Hagen.,"It was really cool to find that this was the very first Gun Smoke ever and even cooler to see John Wayne introduce and endorse the then new program. The vidio contains 2 epasodes in the first its easy to identify with the feelings of the gunslinger who killed a man who cheated him at cards, but he was unaware that the man was unarmed .The killer was a likable man who only wanted to be left alone and come and go as he pleased. The second epasode was about a old freind of matts who was hired to kill him. I hope more of the later series w/Festus will become avalable soon!"
5,Even spray,My wife says I'm a little fanatical about sprinklers - even to the point of putting paper cups out to measure the evenness of sprinklers. Yep! Its my water and our plants. I want even watering. This is the best CIRCULAR sprinker I have found. I've used them for about 6 years and had my first one break. I found the best pattern for mid to full patterns is to adjust the long stream to be pretty jet like. You want to have it hit and continue at about the end of the shorter spray pattern. You may think you are throwing a lot of water out far but there is much more ground to cover out there. Thumbs up!
4,Nice Sprinkler,"I bought this sprinkler hoping that I could bring in a nice lawn without an inground sprinkler system. It does work nice and is very quiet, however, the distribution of water seems much greater at the end of the stream than in the middle. Otherwise it is a nice sprinkler."
3,"watch the movie, water pressure must be very high to go far.","Length:: 0:16 Minsgardena sprinkler video . it does not shoot very far, much less than the pulsating ones. and it seems to put all the water out far away from the head, not close to it. not worth the high cost even with a lifetime warranty."
2,Not good,"This sprinkler is well built and stable. However, the distance and spray adjustment will not stay where it is set. The pressure of the water causes the adjustment to revert back to the factory setting. Useless."
1,Mobile Action for Nextel i870,"Tried on 3 Computers. Worked on 1 for a while. Keeps looking for new USB to Link to phone ALL the Time. Tried erasing program and driver with remove program. Went on Web site to download new software and driver, Downloads new software but won't download new driver. PROGRAM DOESN""T WORK"
2,hip bone connected to the...,"Lots about how to assemble and connect and initialize all the necessary hardware components. Very little about how to get MS Windows to orchestrate the network functionality. As per usual, Windoze makes it look real simple, but in fact, nothing works. The book is no help"
1,Rusting!,"I bought these knives in October 2012 and they have begun to rust! They are stamped ""stainless steel"". I have Ginsu knives that are over 30 years old that don't have a spot of rust on them. I have other Henckels knives that I bought over 10 years ago that are still beautiful. Don't buy these. If I could I would return them for a refund.Update:I noticed another reviewer said German knives are best. These knives are clearly stamped ""made in China."""
3,Not what it looked like,"These are high-quality knives, but I specifically tried to avoid serrated knives, and in the picture they look like they are not. When I got them, they were serrated. The serration is finer than normal, so it doesn't show in the pictures. The description didn't mention serration.I was disappointed."
4,Love these knives !!!,Got a block set of these knives for a wedding gift over 10 years ago. Lost a few along the way. Never thought I would find them for this price. Love these knives. Was looking into replacing the whole set of them. But I got lucky and found just what I needed. Thanks Amazon!!!
5,I am happy with these knives.,These knives are very sharp and seem to be well made. They have a nice balance in your hand. I hope they stand the test of time.
5,Quick and easy,This connector can be installed in 5 minutes or less. When connecting to your factory connector make sure the dirt is cleared out of the outside ring to insure proper seating of the Hopkins connector. I recommend purchasing theHopkins 48595 4Wire Flat Mounting Bracketto mount the plug for a professional look and to keep the 4 prong flat plug secure and easier to get to.
4,essentria TM contact insecticide,"Worked amazingly well with a fine wide spray that killed several wasps on contact. After the first use I used it again a few days later and the tip seemed to be clogged as it didn't produce the same fine spray as it did the first time. I tried to clean it, but was not successful, and therefore not as effective for more than one wasp at a time."
3,Effective but smelly,"This product works well as far as I can tell. Haven't had any further silverfish sitings after using this insecticide, however, it has a really strong odor that lingers for days. It also appears to be oil-based so if you have a problem like I did in my bathroom and you need to spray along the baseboards, tiles, and pipes be warned that it leaves a dark-colored residue and takes days to dry up. Hopefully the fumes are harmless."
5,bug spray,It is the best bug spray ever and it kills everything safely and we highly recommend it for home and office use. 5*****
1,Four thumbs down!!,My husband and I disliked this scent instantly. I have boxed it up for a future yard sale because there are folks that do like it. We found it very be cloying and too strong. The scent changes over time and not for the better. Perhaps I received an old bottle. Unfortunately this type of item is not returnable.
1,Not a good perfume,Too strong. Almost gave an instant headache. I can take a whiff from far away but would not want it too lcose.
2,i do not like it,"the smell is not really good , and there is no box with it. it looks not really good,... o"
1,I did not like this product,"After opening the package ,the spray broke .And I can't used it.I am very disappointed at this product. Is there anyway that I change the perfume."
5,Smell Like a Million Dollars,"I gave Elizabeth Taylor's Black Pearls as a present to my mother. She said the scent strength is moderate, lasts 6-10 hours and it's a flowery fragrance. She loved it! The pure perfume version comes in an exquisite bottle."
5,Terrific,"This oscillating sprinkler is the best one I have ever had -- it works perfectly year after year (if your husband doesn't run over it with the car). Best of all, even when you run your hose slowly by reducing the water pressure at the spigot, this sprinkler still oscillates! It's terrific!"
1,A disposable sprinkler,"I add my disappointment to those others who have complained that the OSCILLATOR quit after a few uses. This happened to me after two or three weeks. I have a Gardena sprinkler that I've had for almost 8 years, so I was a Gardena fan before I bought this one."
1,Worked for less than a day.,"I purchased this from Amazon two weeks ago, and the first time I set it up and used it I was very impressed. It has a wide and thick spray of water, and it did a wonderful job. I moved the sprinkler to another area and it quit working. No movement, just a spray of water.I tried everything from changing the water flow to manually moving the mechanism. Nothing worked.I figure it cost me twenty bucks to water a small part of my yard for half an hour.Avoid this product."
5,My favorite Sprinkler,I have owned this sprinkler for 5 years. It is certainly the longest lasting and easiest to use sprinkler I have ever owned. I am writing this review because I searched for the sprinkler to buy another one (one to use in the front yard and one for the back yard)....
2,Gardena sprinklers-oscillation,I am very disappointed with the 36965-6 Hydrofan. It has been used only half a season and has stopped oscillating. I purchased it because I owned the Vario 3500-31976-6 for three years and loved the ability to custom-fit my spray pattern.Now it also has stopped oscillating.
5,incredible long life,"I purchased one recently to augment(not replace) one that I bought over 10 years ago. They both are going strong. O-ring has been replaced twice in the old one. The best thing about them for me is they will oscillate at very low flow, allowing precision watering of small beds."
2,Good/dense spray pattern but fragile/weak rotating mechanism,"I am now on my 4th and probably last sprinkler of this type. This sprinkler feels solid, has the convenient quick-connect feature of all Gardena sprinklers, and has a concentrated spray pattern (i.e., provides a good soak over a small area vs. most other sprinklers that provide a little water over a larger area). The downfall is in its oscillating mechanism. After intermittent use for home watering, the mechanism in each of the units I purchased stopped oscillating with the ""best"" working for about 6 months and the worst/most recent sprinkler lasting only 2 weeks. Poor performance for the cost - not recommended. I have owned and can recommend Gardena's Gardena 31948-5 Circular Sprinkler Vario/Sled."
2,started well but then stopped oscillating,"While I was waiting for the Gardena Polo 2400 to be ""in stock,"" I picked up a Hydro-Fan. As other reviews note, it has a dense fan pattern that covers an area well, but at low flow rates (necessary given our low-flow well) it will run for a while and then get stuck (stop oscillating).I ordered the Polo 2400 when it was in stock and the 2400 continues to run well, no matter the flow rate."
3,It is adequate....,"Although the price is great, you do, indeed, get what you pay for. You must remain perfectly balanced or it becomes very difficult to ""row""."
4,Excellent Book for Teenagers,"I thought this book was an excellent book for teenagers. It is funny and keeps your attention yet, it also has a real crisis and shows a problem that has been prevalent throughout Australian history and is still somewhat present today in small areas. I think that even though this book is very Australian, American teenagers can relate to it based on American history and the race problems that are still around today even though many Americans would like people to think otherwise."
4,Great Bike,"This is a great bike. It is good looking, fully adjustable, totally quiet and provides a ""no nonsense"" workout. You may need help moving it around due to the heavy wheel. But otherwise, for the money, this is one of the best bikes you can get."
2,"Too much fluff, not enough substance...","This book jumps all over the place and the authors love to stick in references to pop culture which are irrelevant. Most of their stories have nothing to do with kids at all. I was very disappointed in this poorly written book. I tried very hard, but could only read 2 pages at a time b/c I didn't know where the thought process was going. I enjoy reading Christian childrearing books, but this one did not keep my interest. I do however recommend an older book, but still great for parents with kids 5+. It is Gary Smalley's The Key to Your Child's Heart. Great advice in there(other than advocating spanking which I don't personally agree with--hey I'd rather have God upset with me for not hitting my kids than have him upset with me for hitting my kids)and an easy read."
5,Great Book!,"I found this book to be practical, for parents in the trenches. The advise at the end of each chapter (Tips From The Trenches) was extremely helpful, and gave me ideas to impliment the principles outlined in the chapter.When I purchased the book, I thought I'd get an idea or two from it, but as a single parent, I found it to be helpmate that has made me a better parent... on my way to raising ""Totally Awesome Kids""!"
1,Name on box is totally false advertising,"I picked up the THE FOUR-LEAF CLOVER KIT as a little fun gift for myself and an Aunt. When I read the enclosed pamphlet inside the box it basically said enclosed was a bag of clover seeds, none were genetically altered and if you're lucky you might find a four-leaf clover.So the chances of a four-leaf clover in the THE FOUR-LEAF CLOVER KIT are the same as finding a four-leaf clover in the mass of weeds available in any front or back yard.The name on the kit is just a flat out lie and I was very disappointed."
2,4 Leaf Clover Seeds,I choose this item because I was curious to see if they would germinate indoors. They have sprouted and I am completely satisfied with the results.
1,Four leaf clover rip off,Major rip off. Although is says four leaf clover kit in tiny letters at the back of the booklet included with the kit (once you buy it) it says it does not guarentee any four leaf clovers!!
1,ogeodak,Do not waste your money for this kit. All the clovers that we planted with my grandson have 3 leaves. We both are very disappointed.
3,SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING,"Ray Monk is the author of the exceptional biography of Wittgenstein, DUTY OF GENIUS. So, who better to write a book about how to read W? And I admit the minute I saw Monk's name on the book I picked it up. But I am a little disappointed. The idea of this series of books is to select excerpts from the works of an author and then look at each selection in detail as a guide to reading the author's works. I fear that it doesn't work here, though. I suspect that someone who was not already familiar with W would find this less than helpful. Monk's selections from W are interesting, and not the obvious ones you might expect. But I did not come away with any new epiphanies concerning W, which is what I hoped for. (Other than the fact that I should look at his Last Writings On Psychology.)You might be better off just reading something W wrote instead; I would recommend ON CERTAINTY."
1,"Not really an ""Action"" figure at all ...","Just be warned: it is, and always will be, as exactly as you see it in the photos. The elbows do not move, the knees do not move, the cape is molded rubber ... it will always look just like you see it now (it might even have less flexability than the 7"" figure). And the joints are pretty stiff, so you're not going to be able to do anything more with it than set it up someplace in the exact same pose you see it displayed as everywhere else.Not for kids, it'll bore them immediately with it's extremely limited ""action"" potential. But they'll probably remove the hat & knives to use with something else.I found it not at all worth buying."
1,General working life of Sprinkler,"Hi After having purchased this unit from my Local Hardware StoreI find this unit has a very short working life. I have had this unit for a little over 15months and now its innoperable for what reason I am not sure ,I only wish that there was some one in Australia that I could speak to in regards to this. Regards Allan"
5,Great math book!,"It's a great math book, really painless, very easy to understand, has lots of examples and math word problems to practice. I really enjoyed reading it."
1,Terrible,"Even thought the product says it supports all those kinds of nokia phone, it doesn't fit the USB port on my Nokia 7260 at all!"
5,A Must,"For anyone who has ever been completely enchanted by their first fantasy novel, Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman can bring that feeling back over and over again. I've read all of their works out so far and this ranks among the most original I've ever read. The characters are well rounded, the plot is involved and the writing is fast paced. A fantastic read."
4,Pretty good for a new universe.,"This book was pretty good. I say pretty good because I think they could've made the plot a trilogy, which would've made it better. When I got to the end I was like, ""Gee, that was short."" Still, the physics are believable, the characters well developed, and the universe superb. Readers can sympathize with Griffiths and his crew easily. I did. I also liked the (brief) reapearance of Fizban or Zifnab or whoever he is. A nice touch, which you'll understand if you're a devoted fan of Weis/Hickman. I reccomend it, but not as avidly as others by the same authors."
5,Greatest recording of L'histoire,I don't know this CD but I do know the BSO chamber players performance of L'histoire. I have heard many live and recorded performances of this piece but none equals this. Each player is a virtuoso in his own right and the Courtney and Gielgud performances are delightful.Buy this CD.
4,perfect fit,these straps match perfectly and do not requite and extra work to fit them into placeonly giving 4 starts as the original set was a little thicker and had more of a solid feel to itstill these are great as well.
2,"Nice Idea, bad execution","The watch band is a decent replacement for the stock band, feels nicer with cloth vs. the basic hard plastic. The stretchy feel does take a little getting used to.Couple of real problems.1- Not a standard watch band attachment. And with the parts involved clear instruction for the change would be nice.2- The loops for the attachemnt points are not the same (or any type of) stretch material. The watch tore through them after less than a month."
4,Meets the need,"I'm not fond of plastic, rubber, or silicone watch straps. I prefer leather, nylon, or steel bracelets.For a Suunto Vector, leather doesn't make much sense an a proportionally sized steel bracelet would weigh more than the watch and have me walking lop-sided. But the attachment points on the Suunto aren't amenable to a strap wide enough for the watch.So Suunto offers this accessory. Installing the two plastic loops for the strap requires two screwdrivers and some coordination, but I was able to do it with just the screwdrivers. The attachments were fairly obvious, and went on easily enough.It is well made for the kind of environment where the Suunto watches wouldn't look completely geeky, and the plastic attachment points could be used for other nylon straps.It makes the Vector a lot more comfortable for me.E.M. Van Court"
2,"looks good, that's it","The strap is way too short. This is supposed to fit over my jacket?? Yeah right, it barely fits around my wrist. Unless you're a child don't waste your time or money."
2,"Not great, but the few other options...","I like velcro straps on my digital watches. If you want to put a velcro strap on a Suunto Vector, this is pretty much your only option. But not a great one... The band is too short, making it impossible to wear over a long sleeve shirt as I like to do when skiing or motorcycling. Also, it difficult and cumbersome to thread the end through the loop, which you have to do every time you put the watch on. Finally, the amount of velcro used is small, so it wears out quickly and doesn't offer a very firm grip."
3,Replacement Suunto Vector watch band,"Stiffer than the original, and have problem with the end of the band coming out of the holder (slides away)."
1,Not So Magic,"The Magic Action was that when placed in the water the fish would start to swim. This part worked quite well, unfortunately, when taken out of the water it never stopped swimming so the batteries didn't last very long. It's now a fish that just sits in the water motionless because I'm not willing to use new batteries every time the kids want to use it. It would be a lot of fun if only it would turn off."
2,2 of 3 defective-poor workmanship,"arrived yesterday. After 20min of water play (they are very cool and realistic) I took them out of the water and 2 of 3 kept running. Directions said to wipe contacts, which we did. Next morning they were still running. I opened both to find out that the adhesive that was used to hold the motor to the fish ate through the plastic and exposed the motor. I was shocked to see such poor workmanship. How on earth could a product make it out the door without testing the adhesive for such issues? Bottomline the fish are very cool, but your call if you want to take a chance on the quality issue."
2,Drywall,"This video is overly simplistic and pretty much ignores any of the more challenging aspects of finishing drywall.It does not address techniques for achieving acceptable finished joints on end-butted sheets.It does not address ""nail pops"" or the advantages/disadvantages of nails versus screws.There are no close-up shots to show a ""finished"" joint and how to achieve ""even"" or flat joints, on factory edges.Sanding and sponge finishes are mentioned, but not in any detail.If you are facing a serious drywall job and need to know the finer points of drywall finishing you will find this video lacking."
2,Long Insider Joke,"It's like reading a Dilbert cartoon if you've never experienced corporate life - only it goes on much longer. Be aware that the entire book consists of an imaginary trip by the Republican author to a Democratic White House. Don't expect any facts or insights. Even as a Republican, I found the humor to be cloying and self-congratulatory. My impression of this book is: what a complete waste of intellect and energy. It's a really bad reflection on the Republican party."
3,Surprisingly Clever,"In her countless appearances on the msnbc and cnbc babble shows, Huffington usually comes across as a thick-accented foriegner with a simple-minded sense of humor and a deluded sense of patriotism. But in her book ""tales from the Lincoln Bedroom"", Huffington displays a surprising knack for sophisticated satire and her observations of the current political scene are telling. It is hard to believe that this thick-accented, English-as-a-second-language foriegner could have written such a clever piece of non-fiction on her own. The passages in which she makes fun of the physical appearance of administration members Robert Riech, Donna Shalala and Janet Reno are especially amusing. To add a sense of balance to the book, it would have been advisable to make fun of how she, herself, drove her ex-husband to homosexuality. But on the whole, I must say, Bravo, Arianna!"
3,"Smallest ""Large"" size I have ever seen","Is this for those little neurotic toy dogs to make them think that they are not tiny?My pit bull just looked at this & then at me and back at it wondering what he should do with it.Normally it's excited tug O war time, but no way with this mini sized replica of ""Large""Nice quality, but certainly not ""Large"""
3,Not bad for the price,It works ok but feels really cheap. You can easily push past the stopping point because the plastic is will flex however this does not appear to be an issue at the moment. You can save a little money here but you may want to buy one that is metal to last longer. The shut-off is very convenient when you have to change heads alot. I use it for switching between a spray nozzle to my boat motor cleanout hole connection or a pressure washer.
3,Worked great till I dropped it,Worked just fine for about a year until I dropped it and it hit the concrete from about 3 feet up.
4,Very Good,"It sprays out many gallons of Water very fast the hole diameter could be a little smaller and It will still require high pressure high volume of Water, Its Not very efficient and You have to get very close to get the maximum power from the jet stream, other than that It works good and It will last almost forever."
1,Low-IQ commentary.,"I rented this DVD. Utterly useless ramblings by ""music industry"" people - actually a bunch of random dimwits who aren't even smart enough to comment on what Rush's songs are about. One example: a commentator said he asked Neil Peart what the song ""The Trees"" was about, and that Peart said it was simply about trees and there was no other symbolic meaning. The guy apparently thought Peart was serious. Embarrassing."
3,More An Introduction To New Fans Than A Serious Analysis Of The Band,"I liked this doc's format of discussing each album in chronological order. The problem is that only the two or three most popular songs from each record are actually talked about. Obviously dedicated Rush fans would want the lps analyzed in their entirety rather than just a few songs.The bulk of the film is based on comments from interviews mixed alongside clips of the band playing live. The people interviewed include radio djs, musicians and others from the music business. But not anyone I had heard of before. A few had some interesting remarks. But nothing especially revelatory about the band or their music. For those new to Rush this might be a decent intro to the band and what albums to buy first. But hardcore fans will likely be disappointed."
1,entertainment tonight E. T. on Rush,"Hush! Overbearing speaking for type shows with no movies stars(or muscicians) to speak up for themselves is abominibable! Why on earth is this legal, E. T. with Mary Hart and those hoarse face/voice hollywooders who know-it-all with out live interviews with the PEOPLE THEY TALK ABOUT and this with the snobby mucic critics and no one from Rush speaking up to validate this opininated crapola from a thorazine bottle. It was actually made in 1981 and so the standards were different back then as far as people ""beleving this trype"" as in E. T. or E TV. The rare footage can be seen in greater detail on Rush Chronicles ""Limelight"" video with clips from the past. Particular Geddy's Double-bladed bass gitar, and Alex's double-edged gitar in 2112, and Cygnus X-1."
3,'Kink' is an understatement,"I actually didn't quite finish this book. All the occult bs was getting on my nerves. Why does he believe so strongly that he was ""visited"" by an alien inteligence when he was, by his own admission, out of his mind on drugs at the time. Ya ever hear of drug induced hallucinations Dave? This book just about put me off reading about the lives of my favorite musicians. Alot of it was interesting but alot was unsettling too. Dave, your a great guitar player and we all love you for that but some things you should've kept to yourself."
2,Add 2 stars if you're a Kinks fan,"I'm a huge Kinks fan so this was a Must-Read for me. Dave's book demonstrates that he is/was weird, bitter, and sexually depraved. The book fan will capture Kinks fans like myself, but I suspect that other readers may be disgusted with Dave and sympathize with brother/lead-singer Ray. Even I found Dave's chapter about his communication with space aliens over the top."
2,Space Aliens Kidnapped My Hero,"Dave Davies is as important a figure in 60s rock as anyone, but unfortunately you never get a sense of his genius from this autobiography. Except for an entertaining recounting of the genesis of ""You Really Got Me,"" there are very few stories behind all the great music, which leads me to believe Dave really can't remember making ""Muswell Hillbillies"" or ""Arthur."" Even the tales of sex and drugs aren't as interesting as you'd like. And when he gets into his spiritual rebirth/alien encounters, I found myself heading straight for the discography in the back of the book."
1,If a book can be simultaneously essential and awful...,"Here are the two prongs of the dilemma: If you have any interest in The Kinks, this book is a must-read. If you have any interest in good books, you need to turn tail and run. As I told a friend who is a Kinks fanatic, this is the worst book I've ever been compelled to finish. Along with the book as a gift, I presented my friend a photocopied page with highlighted passages, and he thought I constructed a fake. Then he opened KINK and saw the sentences for himself. I could tell you that the passages were about sheep and UFOs, but you wouldn't believe me..."
2,What a burn-out!,"Dave Davies views on his days as a member of the Kinks do little more than show what damage 20+ years of drug and alcohol abuse can do to one who's none too stable to start. At least he stayed in the proper person throughout the writing of the book. Ray couldn't even manage that. This should have been titled ""The Wake and Bake Life of a Rock Star"". Coherent in places, but only just."
1,Major Bug,"I used to use this software in school and remember it being great, but not so anymore. Perhaps it has not been updated for new systems as it claims, but the graphics are terrible, and there is a significant bug in the system. You can scroll through and redo the lessons, except the very first one. The user I bought it for wanted more practice than one try at the lesson, so we had to buy different software entirely."
4,Mavis Beacon taught me to type,"When I was in school, you wrote in cursive and your keyboard time was limited to Oregon Trail if you were lucky. In today's day and age being able to type efficiently and quickly can be extremely important. I had always heard positive things about Mavis Beacon and decided to give her a shot. The first thing I can say about this program is that it is VERY user friendly. Once I had it installed I was ready to start the lessons. After completing several it let me know where my need for improvement was and that was a big help. The arcade games are fun too, lets you get away from the lessons for a bit. Although I have improved tremendously from hunting and pecking the keyboard, I am nowhere near what I am striving for. I plan to continue using this until I can reach a acceptable wpm and then I'll continue to use it as a refresher."
4,Love knows no time limit,A nice ending for the series. The book flowed well and it was interesting. Did not want the book to. End.
2,Disappointed,"I enjoyed every book in this series, except this one. The Heroine whine to much for me about what happened in the past. She went on with her life and got married, to a man she supposedly had loved then widowed. But when she meets her child hood friend and past love. She harps on the pass. I've read just about all of Jackie Merritt's books and this was a no win situation for me. Before I was finished with book, I definitely wanted the man to move on and dump her."
5,Another great Fritz title.,Nice little read. Fritz is a good storyteller. Durable binding and paper as well. The story of Brendan is an intriguing adventure for youth.
4,Very insightful,"I was very glad to read this book. The argument that death row is a contemporary instance of blood sacrifice is highly compelling, and should give us all great pause. His views on the execution of Christ furthermore broadened my limited understanding of Christian beliefs."
3,"Interesting, but it leaves you wondering.","I found this book to be a rather interesting read. The large amount of information provided a lot of insight and could be, at times, quite compelling. I was a little disappointed in the balance between the BPP and AIM sections (the BPP gets about 1/3 of the book). Also, I was left wondering if the authors' stated symapthy with the Native American movement made their writings at all biased. I guess you must have an interest to write something that in depth about a subject, though."
2,"Tombstones is gruesome, even for Block","I am a huge fan of Block and love his Matthew Scudder series, and I do think his books just keep getting better. But I have to say I almost wish I hadn't read this one. The details of the crimes commited by the serial killer psychos are the most gruesome I've ever encountered, and he goes over and over them. I realize he's trying to create really scary bad guys, but for me, this was over the top. Anybody out there who has trouble with explicit descriptions of torture should skip this one."
4,EXCELLENT BUT STILL LOOKING FOR MY 5 STARS,As good a book as any ive ever read traveling through the city with old school detective mathew scudder ands his underground friends this book makes me wanna go back and read all the scudders from the last 3 decades.
4,surprising and delightful story; a humorous look at God,I chose this book for superficial reasons- appealing cover and title. I very much enjoyed the the story and found the characters convincing and engaging. God as narrator seemed like a fun and interesting device. Maybe it is not deep theology but the chain of events seemed consistent with my experience of the way God works in human life.
2,Disappointing,"This book had an interesting premise, but it left me cold and uninspired. While the narration ""by God"" had promise, in the end, the book lacked depth and insight. I was disappointed."
3,Good if you get as part of a package,"The tripod is nice enough, same quality as any other tripod you might find in a package deal. Bag isn't what I would use to transport a camcorder. Cleaning kit is like any other cleaning kit as before. Not worth 39.95, but worth it if you get it as part of a package."
2,This is a $10 Kit,"This kit is something that you would find at a flea market for $10 bucks. I was very disappointed in the tripod. When I attempted to pull the legs out, on the legs actually popped out form the plastic top of the tripod. I noticed than that only two drops of glue had been applied to hold the cheap metal and plastic together. I would be afraid to leave my camera attached to it without a hand on it at all times. The tripod is so lightweight.As for the bag. It isn't that bad. My camera fits in nicely, and it has a shoulder strap.The cleaning kit is laughable at best. A brush like device, some cleaner and a few cleaning sheets.No instructions were included, but it's all self-explanatory.Overall: Don't buy this! I didn't..it came free with a camcorder I bought."
3,Camcorder kit,"BR>Never pricing the items in a store I thought it would be a good deal. Found out it wasn't. The bag was too small, the tripod to flimsy. Went to a local department store and bought a leather bag, twice the size and a very sturdy tripod with more options for the same price. In my opinion this product was over priced."
2,"Good free, not worth $","Got this kit free by buying a camcorder. It's okay free, but wouldn't spend $ for it. Tripod is very basic, no vertical gear mechanism, no plumb indicator, tendency to ""stick"" when panning horizontally. I don't feel secure transporting the camcorder in the bag; when closed there are openings on both sides of the bag where stuff can drop out, and the single zippered pocket is too small to carry much."
2,Fine kit if you get it for free...,"I got this kit free with the purchase of a camcorder, but that's about all it's worth. I wouldn't use the bag, and the tripod is flimsy and short about 4' tall. But this is definately not for pro or semi-pro use. It's mainly for amateur usagae or really short people. I wouldn't buy it unless your family is filled with really short people... Otherwise you'll be looking up a lot of noses and giving unflattering images of their chins."
2,Only get it if it is free....,"I got this free with the sharp video camera I bought. I honestly was expecting a little bit better quality. The tripod is pretty flimsly and I'm not sure how long it will hold up before something breaks. But it mounts the video camera and my digital camera just fine, though when I try to move (pan) with the video camera the tripod wobbles, which makes it almost more worthwhile to just hold it in my hand. But for taking still pictures I guess it would work better. The bag isn't as big as the picture makes it out to be either.Like I said, if it is free, then you can't beat the price! :) But otherwise, buy a better tripod if you are looking for one."
1,They should pay you to take this item,"I got it for free after buying a camcorder. It simple terms it is a real piece of garbage. The bag can't fit a small lunch let alone a camcorder, and if you vaule your equipment don't use the tripod it is flimsy. Good thing I didn't pay for this."
1,How to attach it ?,Simple question: How to attach to a camera? What's the function of the key behind the platform ? What they call quick release platform ?
3,3 stars for the price,"the thing was free, if i had paid for it i would have returned it... the tripod is too flimsy to be of any real use and the bag is too small to hold anything but a stil camera..."
4,Not bad for being free,"(...) It's actually not 4 feet tall, it is if you dont extend the neck. I'm 5'9"" and its just about the right size for me. The case isn't too bad, a little on the cheap end but what do you expect (...)?"
3,Vititar Camcorder Kit,"This value pack was free with purchase, otherwise I would of sent back. The tripod is not vary sturdy and the camera bag is a little small the lense cleaning kit is optional can be used with other this as well. If you are buying this item and are on a budget then it will work but other wise check out other items."
4,convenient tripod!,"This tripod is actually good. First of all, it's very light that you can carry it to whereever you want. Secondly, it can be extended to almost 4 feet high, and when it's fully folded, it only takes a few space. In other words, it fits almost every ranging from a petite size person to a tall person."
4,This is more than a good deal.,(...) This is more than a good deal. The tripod is more than 4 feet tall. Fully extended and with the camera attached it is nearly six feet tall. People would buy this kit on their own so combined with the low camcorder price this is a steel.
1,Lightweight,"This is a very lightweight, standard still camera tripod. The carrying case isn't big enough for much else then a still camera. Take it for a back up if someone gives it to you for free."
1,The Camcorder stand is horrible.!!! Very fragile.,I hardly used the Camcorder stand thrice and one of the legs came off.!!! The Camcorder stand is really no good. I suggest that you should not see the stand as it would have a BAD amazon site loyalty for the customers.The SCL 770 - Samsung Camcorder is great and the bag is also good.
1,Melnor #3900 Sprinkler,"I returned the sprinkler because it would not reverse. The second did the same thing. In both cases the reverse linkage hangs up, but for different reasons. I haven`t not been able to get any use out of it."
1,10 YEARS!!!! MINE DIDN'T LAST 10 DAYS,"Worked great the first two times I used it. Go to use it a third time and the head stops turning. I oiled the bejesus out of it and now it will turn very slowly in one direction, but does not come back. Am I missing something? Where's the manual for this pos!?"
2,Not the same quality as previously owned version,"I was disappointed upon receiving this sprinkler and I would say that ""heavy duty"" should not be in the title.First, the impact portion is of a light weight metal and plastic, not brass. Not sure how long it will last.Second, the base is a cheap stamped metal and much lighter than my last one.Third, the adjustments are not easy to use, do not stay in place and I have trouble adjusting it to deliver water where I desire.All in all, not the quality I expected from Melnor and definitely, not Heavy Duty. I would not purchase this sprinkler again. For those interested - this is made in China."
2,Good operation for 1.5years,Sprinkler worked great for 1 1/2 years and then stopped rotating. Lubricated to no avail. Tightened spring just a bit and it made no difference. Disappointed in duration as I grew up with pulsators on farm irrigation that worked for 5-6 years without a hitch.
1,piece of junk,"Bought one of these and it worked great for 30 minutes! After that it would not rotate. Okay, so I bought a lemon. Took it back to Wal Mart, exchanged it for another one. Took it home, hooked it up and it rotated THREE times and stopped!!!!! Piece of junk!"
2,Doesn't work,"This sprinkler has never worked correctly for me. The head will do the correct spray pattern for a cycle or two, then stick and lock in position, flooding one section of the lawn while never watering the rest. I've tried various settings, all with the same result. Save your money for a better watering system."
1,how hard can it be?,It simply does not work. How hard can it be to make a sprinkler? This is not a passing grade at all; we need to be able to assign zeros.
1,Won't Reverse,"Sprinkler didn't work out of the box. Does not reverse. We tried all the settings possible, but no luck at all. It just gets stuck in one position and won't rotate at all. We are returning it. Also aggravating that there are no instructions included. Do NOT recommend this product."
2,Stopped rotating after 1 month,Works well when it works. The rotating mechanism stopped working after only a short time. Must be poor manufacturing or such. I should have spent a little more for a better product.
2,Stay away from this sprinkler,I purchased this sprinkler almost a year ago. At first it worked great. Now I have to constantly keep my eye on it. It will stop rotating and just sit in one location. Do not buy this sprinkler.
3,Symbols of Faith: Teaching Images of Christian Faith for Intergenerational Use,"The patterns/images were very helpful in preparing lessons, but I found the lesson ideas very vague. There were a few creative ideas to build off of."
4,Great Teaching Tool,"This is a great book to help children understand the different symbols from Christianity. Works well with bulletin boards, and seasonal craft ideas."
3,Learn Photoshop elements 7 ?,"I would have given this DVD a much higher rank had it not left you still in the dark regarding the most important element of 7. Layers failed (In my mind ) to be addressed enough. I am interested in fine tuning my photographs utilizing the most powerful feature of 7,not adding text to something I will more the likely never use.All said and done however, the DVD did offer some insight into the workings of Elements 7.Mike"
5,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - Very Impressed - I LOVED THIS DVD!,"I really loved this DVD. I didn't know much about Photoshop Elements but after watching the lessons, I am able to do all kinds of stuff. I erased scratches off of some cherished photos, removed red eye, added some neat effects, and improved the coloring of my photos.It was nice learning how layers work and how to create header graphics that I plan to use on a blog. This DVD is an EXCELLENT resource and I highly recommend it. It is the best stuff I have seen for Photoshop Elements.I knew next to nothing about this software and now I am able to do lots of different things with it. Thanks so much!"
2,Should be better,AmazonI am particularly disappointed with the video quality. The menu system on the right of screen is out of focus & barely readable.I was over charged on the stated freight price & a non accurate exchange rate was used for calculating the priceThe content did reach the pass mark
3,"slightly better than textbook, but still lacking","I used the textbook written by the same author in class, which was one of the most dense, example-less books I've ever read. The prep book is slightly better, explaining things clearly and briefly, but sometimes it does lack in depth. It should review more of the basics, even if they are elementary, such as how to write functions, or the order of accessing multiple functions. It was annoying to have to go online in the middle of a practice test to get the Marine Bio Case Study questions. But what really bothered me was that there were no EXPLANATIONS for the practice test multiple choice questions, only a list of one-line hints for about 10 out of 40 questions. I really can't learn from mistakes if they don't explain why the answers are right/wrong."
4,nighthunterseries,"I have read the whole series of the nighthunter books and found them fascinating if a little far-fetched. The outline is of a man obsessed with finding his family who have been kidnapped by a group of occultists,whos aim is to resurrect all paths of magic and demonology,and to take over the world. A must for all fans of fantasy and occult stories. The other books not listed are;TheHexing and The Labyrinth."
5,Excellent Contracts Treatise,"This treatise is an excellent study aid. Mr. Blum does a superb job of covering basic Contracts material. There are no omissions as far as I know from the book, and I have not found any mistakes. Blum goes into just enough depth to make sure that you understand the material, and the examples and explanations section is extremely helpful. I wholeheartedly recommend this treatise."
2,Thought this would be Glannon-esque...,"I was not particularly impressed w/Blum. I feel that contracts is a complicated subject, but this did not assist me at all in my course. Granted, it could've been my teacher, but I feel that Blum essentially contradicted what my teacher said, which I found confusing about contract law, considering that it's supposedly cut and dry. I got a little use of it when learning restitution and reliance, and a friend told me it helped her w/the parol evidence rule, but I can honestly say most of it just presented huge questions that my teacher was not even raising in class or through the reading. So if you choose a contracts supplement, use it w/caution...you could go down a very bad road by choosing and relying upon the wrong supplement."
2,not as good as other Examples and Explanations,"I had a great experience with the Civil Procedure Examples and Explanations, and was expecting a similar experience with Contracts. Unfortunately, this book was not nearly as easy to understand. If I have a question in Contracts, I cannot refer to this book as I could in Civil Procedure."
2,CONTRACTS EXAMPLES AND EXPLANATIONS,bOOK IS NOT IN GOOD CONDITION- LOYS OF UNDERLINING. I WAS TOLD IN NEW CONDITION. IN FUTURE READERS SHOULD BE CAREFUL NOT TO BUY OLD BOOKS. I BOUGHT THIS BOOK FOR CITY OF NEW YORK EXAMS HOW TO PREPARE A CONTRACT. BOOK MAY BE USEFUL FOR LAW SCHOOL NOT FOR CIVIL SERVICE EXAMS. I AM REQUESTING AMAZON FOR MY MONEY BACK. THANKS
4,This book rocks!!,"I found this to be the most entertaining novel I have ever read. The book is easier to read than a normal novel because it is in comic book form.For a visual reader, this makes the book much more interesting to read.The suspense is developed well to a sharp climax.I could not put this down until I read every single page!!!Myke Feinman's work has improved greatly since his first graphic novel, ""The Mask Conspiracy,"" which features the same main characters.""The Crystal Skull Files"" is a sequel to The Mask Conspiracy.The book would make an excellent discussion topic for any classroom which is discussing the First Amendment when the main characters have to fight for their lives and freedom in the ""Land Of The Free As Long As You Agree."" The letters make up an acronym of Lotfalaya, which is the name of the country.Perhaps Feinman will coin a new word, ""Lotfalaya"" which would mean a place where people cannot think freely!Great Read!"
1,SLOW SHIPPING,"Was forced to charge back item ""did Not Receive""Finally came will pay in next CC bill.Why I don't like on-line buying!!!!!R. Boudreau"
3,"Worked for a little while, but after I stopped I was constipated.","I used this for a month. Then I went on vacation and forgot to bring the tea with me. The whole week I was on vacation, I was constipated and couldn't use the bathroom. And I was on vacation so I ate twice as much as what I usually ate, but that didn't help push anything through either. So I'd say if you're going to use this, it would probably have to be long term. Or you would need to test it out for a short period to see how it effects your digestive system."
1,Awfull be carefull with it!,"Its just a plain laxative and diuretics.First day you would feel really sick and drowsy, loose a few pounds of water weight from diarrhea and have a bad headache.I dont know how it would work in a long term but surely not good for you. The only reason i can imagine ever using it would be a so bad constipation that i wouldnt care about the side effects."
5,IT'S THE BOMB,"THIS TEA WORKS RIGHT AWAY, I PUT 6 TEA BAGS AND REDUCE IT TO ONE SHOT I DRANK IT FOR 7 DAYS I LOST 15 LBS.TO ALL THE OVERWEIGHT OUT THERE THIS IS THE ONLY SOLUTION."
2,Didn't work for me...,"After reading reviews, I was very excited to try this. I've been stopped up for a while and was looking forward to the relief this senna tea would bring.The first time I took it, I steeped the tea for 3 minutes... nothing. The next time, I steeped for five minutes... nothing. My increasing the steeping time went on for days until one day, I steeped a bag until there was nothing but a dark, condensed and almost syrup-like liquid left... nothing.Pretty disappointing because I really needed something to help with my constipation. I'm now stuck with three months' worth of the stuff.One positive is that it tastes pretty decent. I was expecting it to be disgusting, but was surprised that the taste was actually very mild and light. The taste of Ballerina Tea is the reason that I'm rating it two stars instead of one."
3,"Tastes decent. Will keep you ""regular.""","I'm trying to lose about 50 lbs of the ""baby weight"" I gained and retained since having my 2 young kids (ages 5 mos and 4 yo.) I decided to give this tea a try based on the reviews. Positives: 1.) It tastes decent, once you add some sweetener (Splenda or Stevia.) 2.) It will keep you ""regular"" (it takes effect for me about 8 hours after drinking.) Negatives: 1.) When it does ""take effect,"" it is an URGENT situation. You better make sure you have a toilet nearby, very close nearby. 2.) It gives me serious gas. I am unsure at this point if it is helping with the weight loss, because I am eating a healthier diet too."
3,Poop,"If you want to spend your life in a bathroom, go ahead and order it! It works. You will go poop up to 10 times a day! If you work it is impossible to drink this tea. You loose pounds, but you want to eat more and more. Healthytrim is the best!"
4,Works good,"This is more like a detox tea, I use it during the week as a SAHM. I regret using it on the weekend the first week because I had terrible stomach pains and didnt want to go anywhere. I'd recommend this to anyone who is having a constipation issue. Other than that I would say use it and then take a break for a week then go back. Im losing weight since using it(4lbs a week), it helps with bloat and personally I think it tastes great. I will be buying more."
4,tea,I am pleased for the brew. thank you.I just wish folks would not rib on me for using this product as well as other products.
3,It's OK,"Unlike some other reviewers, I do not like the taste. I have to force myself to drink it, with lots of sugar. I drank a glass at bedtime, waiting for the bathroom to call, I waited for 12 hours. Not what I had expected from the other reviews. No cramping,no ill side effects.It did help me to eliminate some extra waste I suppose. I have only started to drink it, I will add more to my review if anything changes."
4,I will do business with again,"The product arrived as expected but I feel it could arrive a little eariler, however I feel it was very good purchase and I will do business with them again."
2,Gross,"All this tea does is make you move your bowels. If I wanted to ""move my bowels"" so much, I'd eat at Mcdonalds. Thanks. Don't waste your money."
2,MESSED UP MY SYSTEM.. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND,I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. IT MESSED UP MY STOMACH. IT MADE ME MORE BLOATED THAN EVER. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. EVERYBODY SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT. DOES NOT HELP YOU LOSE WEIGHT. THE ONLY WAY TO LOSE WEIGHT IS TO EXERCISE AND WATCH YOUR DIET.
5,90 POUNDS IN 3 MONTHS your kidding!,"This tea works like a miracle. I drink 2 cups and 1 cup of wu long a day, and i do jillians workout and ana caban ab workout dvds i didn't pay much attention too much cause i work 2 full time jobs. You know what its like to work so much and not really be able to stare in the mirror. i went from 230 to 140 in 3 months and i'm like whoa are you kidding me! I gain so much that very minute i looked in the mirror. I am definitel going to keep up with this figure i have. I worked so hard for it stress free and it turned out better than i can imagine. Guys give it just like a month. only 2 weeks went by and people were telling me my face look thinner lol i guess i been so busy with working and excersing all in one i paid no attention to the mirror or the scale unitl today. i drink it with the siet lipton raspberry juice. it taste very good. Guys i'm serious. 90 pounds just gone in 3 months. I feel incredible!!! 5 STARS ALL THE WAY!!! ALLLL THE WAYYYYY!!!"
3,its ok,"My friend swore by it. so i decided to by it. it does make you go, but its not a good taste or good feeling, it made my stomach hurt really bad. if you need constipation releave go for it. other than that its not a miracle worker."
4,Worth it,"If you're looking for a cleansing tea that is reliable and easy on your stomach, this is worth your money. i would recommend it."
3,Get ready to go Poop!,"This is basically a laxative. It will help you ""cleanse"" out your system by messing with your bowel movements. It is all clearly stated in the box and plastic wrapper. Fair warning, if you must use this, try the regular strength at first! This one will just keep you in the toilet for a whole day. Also, it is advised that you do not use this daily."
2,Works for bowel movements but is harmful,"I've been using the tea for 3 days but stopped because I was having awful cramps and had to change around my daily schedule since I was using the bathroom so much. I stopped going to the gym for the past three days and went home from work sick today.The tea obviously works for going to the bathroom but to an extreme degree that doesn't seem healthy and is really painful. I stopped taking the tea today after going home from work and went on webmd to look up senna (the active ingredient in the tea).Here's what webmd said ""Avoid products containing senna (Cassia senna), which is an especially strong herbal laxative and can be habit forming. Also, senna can cause staining of the lining of the colon, which may result in a condition called melanosis coli.""So if you are looking for something for weight loss, I think the only weight you would loose would be from going to the bathroom....but even that is painful and there are better options."
5,arrived on time and in new package,It came with one sealed bag in the box so it stays fresh before opening it. I am satisfied with my purchase and I will later leave a review of how the tea worked.
4,Dilute is my middle name!,"This tea is amazing. I have been drinking it now for about a week and I have lost 9 lbs. It relieves a lot of symptoms that I was having and I feel great. I first suffered from cramps the first 2 nights, but then I realized that I needed to use more water in my tea. If you use a 10 oz glass vs. a 5-8 oz. glass of water to make the tea it is amazing how much it relives the cramping. I've never cramped since. Also I like that I can add some cranberry juice to the tea and it tastes fine. I have been chilling my tea and making a cranberry cocktail. I put it in my thermos and I take it to work with me for a glass after lunch."
5,Good quality and as expected,This is a common size for space heaters. It can be trimmed a little and reused after it tars up with use.
3,So-so,"I haven't finished reading it yet, but so far its mediocre. Good ideas, but just isn't a fun or addicting book to read. Maybe it will get better later on in the book."
3,I tried to give it 2 1/2 stars but you can't do that,"No offence to the show or quality of the DVD itself but the price just wasn't right for this one, when you read the cover it says the names of 3 episodes plus bonus material that says bonus episode how to draw and other fun things but unless they count one of the 3 mentioned episodes there is no bonus episode like I said before it's just not worth the price I'd recommend this only to big Kappa Mikey fans."
5,so funny it hurts,I love this show just for the comedy and lack of seriousness. I go to this show when I am having a downer day and it makes me laugh so hard I think I am going to crack a rib.
3,Kappa Mikey,"Did you think this movie would be intelligent? Cute. Teen age insults/ slurs abound, but made for a younger audience that wouldn't understand the language (and you don't want them to). Tom and Jerry is funnier. Movie that you watch once and don't want to watch with your friends, (but it's cool to admit you own one). Better for fullfilling that list of ""wants"" than a belly ring and just as satisfying."
1,Garden hose repair,"I purchase this product for my garden hose end repair.It stated that it would fit a 5/8 or a 1/2""hose.how could it possibly fit a smaller dia.I think some one got a little confused I manage to fine a 1/2"""
3,"Not Really Made for 1/2"" Hoses","I bought this item to repair a broken end of a Gardena 1/2"" cloth hose. Although the description states it is made for both 1/2"" and 5/8"" hoses, getting it to fit the smaller size is not easy. I sprayed some WD40 on the connector and managed to get the hose on. Without the WD40 - no chance. So far, so good. But it sure would be easier if Gardena had a 1/2"" connector for sale in the US."
5,GardenaLover,"Gardena fittings are the most user-friendly and reliable hose fittings I have come across. When I was in Australia, I used to use this and this is a very popular line there. I dont know if it is the hoses in USA or the the connector, it is very hard to insert the hose end into the connector and have the claws bite into it without the fear of snapping them. This is the only thing I have. The fit is very good and there are no leaks. The quick-connect is a breeze. I have bought the connectors, nozzle etc and I have set up a mobile outdoor shower that uses the Gardena nozzle."
1,Gardena Hose Connecter,"The correct # for a 1/2"" is a mystery. The description claims that the connecter will work on 5/8"" and 1/2"" hoses. It is a ""bear"" to connect a 1/2"" hose (Gardena) to this connecter. I'm sure that the 5/8"" hoses will work but not both sizes."
3,I wish..................,"I wish there were more recorded performances of this brilliantly funny lady. I did purchase this DVD, and enjoyed seeing Totie perform again. However, the material wasn't that funny. To me at least. I know she incorporated her health issues in her monologues, but this particular performance just made me feel.....sad. Maybe one day someone will discover lost videos of Totie. She deserves to be remembered, but not like this."
2,Hello/Goodbye,"How I wish they could have found an earlier performance to put on DVD. I love Totie Fields and think she was one of the best female comics of all time, but the HBO special made of her triumphant return to the stage after losing her leg is not very funny. Oh do not get me wrong there are some great lines but overall this is a more sentimental performance. The special is really a thank you card to her friends, family and fans but what is to be a happy hello becomes a goodbye as she did not live much longer after this performance. I can only hope that there is more material out there to be released to highlight her comedic brilliance."
5,Great and excellent value!!,Great auditing book for beginners. Very detailed concepts described in this book. And the price is just so cheap! I booked it on Amazon and just one day later I got the book! Great shipping and package too!
3,Does not fit Makita Wet 4 inch Stone Polisher,I purchased this to use with the Makita Wet 4 inch Stone Polisher. The Gardena 36001 Garden Hose Quick Connector was recommended as something people who bought the Stone Polisher also purchased. It doesn't fit the Makita Polisher. Don't buy it if you intend to use it on the Makita Stone Polisher.
1,Inferior product,I have had these adapters split three times in a year. An inferior product that caused my water to run for hours costing me money
4,Ease of Use,"Bought these along with the hose connectors from Gardena, all products work fine, and make life a little simpler,I would recommend product for making life a little easier..."
1,Make sure that it's compatible,This is NOT compatible with SCPH-30000 series or the SCPH 50000 series. Thought others might not want waste their time if they also have one of the series that it's not compatible with.
5,Multi-Tap for older PS2,"This Multi-Tap was in perfect working order. However, there are at least three different Multi-Taps on the market (by Sony) that work with specific PS2 models. This particular one was for the older PS2, not the newer PS2 (I didn't know this prior to ordering, nor did the seller indicate it was for the older PS2 systems). Luckily, I have an older PS2 system AND a newer PS2 system, and can use the Multi-Tap with my older system. Check your owner's manual for your PS2 to see which Multi-Tap your system is compatible with ( it will be at the end of the manual). Great product regardless."
4,Works well as long as you use it with a PS2 Fat,"The Multitap worked well as expected, because of it being Sony brand and not a knock-off. The only problem was it DOES NOT WORK WITH PS2 SLIM. It only works with the PS2 fat and not the slim because its connector shape will not insert into the PS2 slim."
3,Multi-tap,The multi-tap that we got through Amazon was accurately described and in great condition when it arrived in a timely manner. Thank you.
1,Not Like New,I paid 45 for a Greek Cookbook. The book was in terrible shape. The front cover was HAND taped to keep it together. There was no description or dates for the cookbook. I ordered based on the name of the Church. I would not have ordered if I would have known location of Church. Horrible book. I am very very disappointed. I won't order from this company again. They aren't even worthy of 1 star.
5,Could it really live up to the reviews???,"YES!!!I had to wonder if this book could live up its several favorable reviews. I read it and the answer is Yes.This book is as fantastic as people say it is. I'm not such a good writer of reviews. Let's just say that it's true what the reviews say: ""Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voices"" is the best new holiday book out.It's sad. It's funny. It inspiring. It's heartwarming."
5,A Book for all Seasons,I recently suffered a loss of a loved one. A dear friend gave me this book and said it would help me cope with my loss.She was right. This book really does offer hope and comfort to those who are grieving.I highly recommend it.
3,Great book--Restaurant like the one in my neighborhood,"Allen's book is great. I echo what the other reviewers have said. I just wanted to say that I had to laugh when I read the part about the restaurant that had changed so many times over the years.There's a restaurant in my neighborhood just like that. It's been a Korean restaurant, as well a Chinese, Mexican, regular Burger and fries, and now it's a sub shop.I also liked the part about the catcher's mitt.Allen's style reminds me a lot of one of my other favorite authors, Stuart Woods. He also writes like Zane Grey.Allen's book will really lift your spirits."
3,I Hate This Book/I Love This Book,"As an atheist, I am offended by Allen's casual portray of life after death and a ""Higher Power."" I don't share Allen's faith in these matters and I resent him trying to shove them down my throat!So why don't I give his book the lowest rating of 1 star? Simply because I have to admit that the book is very well written. Allen knows how to write.I just hope that the next book he writes is of a more secular nature...not driven by a faith inspiring agenda!"
5,My new favorite Christmas Book!,"This book gets better with each reading...and so far I've read it six times!This is a book of comfort, inspiration, faith...a parable about the rewards of anonymous service...a story of eternal bonds. This story shows how service to others can make a life meaningful, even after the most severe and traumatic of tragidies.Life can bring you to your knees in despair...but it can also exalt you when you learn what great things can come of everyday kindnesses.This book has made me really think!John Allen is a consumate story teller...a modern day Dickens. I contacted HCI Books and they told me John is working on another book that should be completed soon. I cannot wait to read it!Also recommended: The Christmas Jars--wonderful!"
2,It was just 'okay',"This book was in my opinion average at best. Yes it had some sad parts, yes it had some warm parts, but all very expectant. You knew what was coming down the road with every page turned. To me it just wasn't worth the time I spent reading it. You can judge a book by how often you think about it once you've finished it. Does it linger on your mind? Does it strike an emotion in you when you think about it? This book does none of that. Once I finished it and put it down, I never thought about it again. The writing style of the Author felt more like someone that is in high school. No depth. The book was also very short with larger font so it didn't take more than a an hour and half to read."
4,Intriguing and thought-provoking,"R. Edwin Sherman's ""Bible Code Bombshell"" intrigued me. So, I grabbed this book and scanned the table of contents. I jumped right to chapter 4: Using the Isaiah 53 Cluster to Answer Code Skeptics. Big mistake. This book is not fluff, and must be read in sequence if you are not familiar with these concepts already. So, I recommend starting at the beginning to gain a full foundation of the concepts of this form of analysis.Sherman is the founder of the Isaac Newton Bible Code Research Society [...]). He presents an in-depth (yet I'm sure this book only scratches the surface) analysis of several sources, Biblical and secular. This book is a very heady read, and it's going to take me some time to digest."
1,Variations on a bad theme,"More ""Chariots of the Gods"" level intellect and hyperbole. A more expansive lie than Drosdin's drivel.The Bible predicted 9/11? It's not much of a prophecy after the fact, is it.For a study on the real Bible code in prophecy, the one that tells us what God is like and how we should live, read ""The Character Map"" by H.E. Eickleberry, Jr."
2,A little better,"I still think Ms. Miller has real talent, but you'd be hard-pressed to realize it by I'm telling. Serious subject? Absolutely. But: undeveloped characters, hard to have sympathy for characters, way too little detail and, again, a Tolkien-level fantasy ending. I know fiction is escapism, but can't it be a little closer to real life? I'm curions to see Ms. Miller's third novel."
2,Very Disappointing,"I want very much to say something good about this book, after all I did like Satin Dolls (by the same author) and I was extremely eager to read this one. However, I was very disappointed in both the story and the entire book. It was indeed a quick read, perhaps a little to quick, I just wanted to hurry and get it over with. The story line was interesting enough, but the body of work didn't really enhance the initial story line. The ending was very predictable and it just plain lacked any depth."
3,A PAGE TURNING,"I couldn't wait for this book to hit bookstores. I called around town trying to locate a copy and finally I was able to purchase it from a local bookstore only to find out that Karen will be in my city signing her book today Tue 7/23/02. I was very so much unhappy that the author did not start with the girls being kids living in the house with papa and all of the incest that took place. It seems like the author wanted you to purchase the book only to find out that she started off with Faith/Hope as grown ladies. I really wanted to read more of relationship the (4) had while growing up. But all and all it was truely a ""owesome"" book to read. She touched on incest,relationships, sex, gay....I look forward to reading her next book."
3,I'm Telling,"I think this book was good in dealing with issues of child abuse, this family was not the only one that try to sweep situations like these under the rug. I think the ending was rushed but the story was wonderul and unpredictable."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I only committed to finishing the book simply because I'd already invested time starting it, but I did not find it a satisfying read !! I was impressed with Ms. Miller's debut ""Satin Doll"" and decided to support her second effort, but I felt cheated. This book lacked closure, the characters were semi developed, why was the crackhead Tina even necessary ?I did appreciate some of the humor in the book, I giggled a few times. But the ending was for the birds, it needed a lot of work and left me feeling like ... okaaaay aaaaaaand ?!?!?!?!?!?!?"
2,Couldn't Get Through It,"I've read dozens of books, both fiction and nonfiction, dealing with child abuse, but for some reason the prologue of this one turned my stomach, I'm not sure why. Nor did I get much farther. I was at a friend's house on a sleepover and brought this little novel along to fill in the dull moments, but the moments remained dull even with I'm Telling. Try as I might, I could not force my way into this book. I tried skipping some chapters and jumping into the middle, but that didn't work any better. The story was heavy, overdone, and sluggish. Perhaps I just need more action and less description of small feelings and details, but this one felt suffocating and after finally coming up for air, I did not go back."
4,Well written story,"I'm Telling is a story about a family that was victimized by incest.Twins by birth but different as night and day. Faith, a literary agent, has a successful business and faithful boyfriend Henry.Hope, drug users..drowning in sorrow that she is to blame for the incest at the hands of their stepfather. While Faith work to help her sister heal from a troubled childhood their elationship is put to the test. Mrs. Irene was in denial. I was very disappointed in her character.I'm Telling is an extremely interesting and well written story. Very touchy subject matter. One setting read. Best Wishes and support to Karen."
2,Misunderstanding,"I felt this was a good book but not good enough. I fought to finish this book ""never start a book without finishing it."" I book didn't hold enough drama and things i can relate. When the end came I was neither happy, satisfied, or sad. I WAS CONFUSED! I don't know if i was confused because of my age [15, i'll be 16 in month] but i just didn't understand why the book had ended. I felt the book wasn't done telling it's story, like it didn't get it's point across. Is there a part 2 to this book?"
4,I enjoyed this book,"This was a simple enjoyable fun read. It was about a dysfunctional family. Although after growing up I have learned most families are dysfunctional.There is not any such thing as a perfect family. Every family has different dynamics that you or I might not understand but to them it is normal. In this story you have twin sisters one who is fairly accomplished in life where the other one is a screw up. The ""bad"" does some terrible things to her sister her twin no less that I wouldn't do to an enemy. The mother of the twins well she is a whole different story altogether. I found her weird and eccentric at times. And at one point in this book I didn't like her at all for not protecting her children which led them to do unsafe things. This was a very simple easy fastpaced read."
2,You're Kidding Me!,"For the author to pass this off as a novel is just beyond sad. The story was ok, but there was no character development, no real backstory, no plot development, nothing. It felt like the author just threw something together to meet a deadline. I think the author missed a real opportunity to explore the topic of incest and how it affects the victim and the victimizer. I will say that there was one steamy scene that's worth mentioning. I predicted what ""happened"" with Hope and Henry, although my outcome was wrong. I also predicted the ending and was on point. This is a lightweight, easy to read short story. Something to take to the beach or the park. Not worth a purchase at all. Oh, and by the by, y'all is spelled y'all!"
4,A page turner all the way...,"Ms. Miller has outdone herself again! With an enthralling story line and life-like characters, ""I'm Telling"" soars high and keeps the reader going and going until the end!Cindy Boydauthor of Letting the Dog Outwww.lettingthedogout.com"
1,B-o-r-i-n-g!!!,What a disapointment!!! I can't even finish this book it is so boring. The book is suppose to be about a young girl being molested and her twin sister carrying this secret inside for fear of hurting her mother. (Yeah right) you would think that is what the plot is but noooooo it starts out as the girls being almost 30 years old. The book was poorly written it could not hold my interest. Satin Doll was a much better book. If at all possible please wait and buy this book at a garage sale or check it out in the library.
1,no tombs up,This book started off great but the more i read this more i dislike like the book the charcters were unreal and why was susan and james name mention in the story? i will tell my friends to walk pass this book in the book store. The plot could have being great however.
3,"Interesting subject matter, poorly put together","I take nothing from Ms. Quiones ability to write.I found the book lacking in the area of keeping my attention , itwas predictable. If I look at this from an autobiographical standpoint , then I cannot critique it, if Ilook at this from a literary view, it lacked staying powersorry , honesty is the best policy"
4,Drama Family,"Faith & Hope are twins. Since Faith was the oldest she was supposed to look out for Hope. Faith did whatever she could for Hope. When they was kids, Hope was molested by their stepfather. Hope always believed that she brung it on herself. Hope really does have emotional problems. The problems that family has really need to be on Jerry Springer. It was messed up what Hope did to Faith,after all Faith did to show her her love. This book is a quick read and it's interesting."
3,Exciting read,After I had read some of the reviews online I thought it was going to be garbage but it was satisfying to a point. I really liked the book but the ending seemed kind of rushed. I feel the author sort of left it hanging a little but overall it was a good book. Hope is a pure trip!!
3,GOod yet a little ova the edge,"This book is just as good as Satin Doll but what had me laughing in this book was the fact that it was too unreal and superficial that confused me! The book has a beautiful ending and I think that's what matter. The book's stucture is awesome but again, a little over the edge."
3,Could have been better,I really liked the whole concept of this book. However I thought the author rushed through it.
3,"Hmmmmm, I guess....","I read the summary on the back of the book and knew this book was gonna be good-in a way, I wasn't wrong. The ending was a complete shock and the plot was extremely interesting. But the author had an annoying habit of making this book read more like a manual on ""How to love the Harlem Renaissance"" and ""How to be an editor"". The characters were realistic but the actions were not--a crackhead with no criminal charges? A crack dealer with no record?Overall, great story--but the little missing details and unrealistic views made it hard to follow. A prime example would be how the couple went from just meeting and him being so irritated by not knowing her name to immediately knowing her sister's name before the chapters over. I think the ""How to be an editor"" rules should've been followed by the author."
4,Good Book!,I read this book in a day and a half. It had you from the very first page and I counldn't wait to finish reading it. I will say that it kind of wrapped up pretty fast in the end. But I was not disappointed at all. This is one that should be on your reading list.
4,Not disappointed,I was not disappointed with this book. The storyline was an excellent one. The author really created believable characters and held my attention so much that I read this book to completion in one sitting. Not because it was so simple but because it was jusy plain good. Keep up the good work and hurry with your next book.
3,Frank Gorshin was a great talent,"I really liked Frank Gorshin; he had a gift for physically resembling the person he was impersonating BUT this particular DVD is a bit of a disappointment in that the quality of sound varies. It's worth a watch, but I don't know that it's a ""keeper""."
3,"Hey, Frank, thanks for the memories ! ! !","I've enjoyed him back in the day, he was the best in the Ed Sullivan phase. He also was still great during the Kopycats show. At the time of this HBO special he was not up for the task. He was great as Kirk, Burt, and the Riddler. Rich Little was his heir apparent. At the time of this performance, Rich was rising and Frank,unfortunately was waning. In my memory tho, Frank Gorshin rules. ""hey, Kirk, how come you always have soup for lunch...........cause it's the only thing I can get between my teeth."" Hey, Frank, thanks for the memories! And still was fun watching him again, too bad he wasn't on top of his game. But, there were moments!"
5,perfect title,"I am a weight watchers cookbook collector. I buy every cookbook they publish and always find many recipes to add to my rotation. Well, this book did not disappoint and in fact the stories through the years were so entertaining that I truly enjoyed just reading the book as well. I highly recommend. In fact I even picked up copies for both my sisters!!"
5,Geat product,Very heavy duty.Has a twistable head so the valves are always upright.Turning the valves is very easy and smooth.I would buy another one when I need it.
1,Worst 2-way connector I've ever bought,"This connector may be very sturdy, but it's practically impossible to operate. If I have to use pliers to turn a small ball valve, I believe there's something wrong with manufacturing tolerances."
1,LEAD?,This product contains lead and says to be sure and wash your hands after touching! Should be stated in the ad.
2,Great it ain't--Beware,"I have used dozens of adaptors and splitters over the years on the farm--this one is above average, but it is still junk. Beware! It may be brass but don't be fooled--they all have plastic connectors to the faucet and these break or leak--typically all of them last a year if you are lucky. DO NOT leave it with the water turned on. They will fail and you will have a huge water bill. This has happened twice, all with Gilmour products. It is easy to forget, since you THINK the water is off, only to find that these failed and you have flooded the yard aat a cost of over $100 IF you catch it in time. If someone made a quality splitter or adpter, I would buy it in an instant!"
4,Would be better if I could turn the valves! Update!,"So far, I have not been able to turn the valves to make this turn off. I plan to try WD40 or somthing to see if that will help. I have stronger hands than my husband so I am not sure what the problem is.HOWEVER, after spraying with WD40, I was able to turn these, and they work fine. So far, they are holding up well."
1,"Beware, contains lead!","I was going to use Gilmour Brass 2-Way Connector on our organic vegetable garden, but the lead content has changed that plan. Disappointed. I am nursing a newborn, so the lead content is of particular concern to me."
1,Water Hose Connector,"Item was shipped promptly and works as advertised, no problems to report. Sprinkler hoses on the other hand were very poorly made and leak more water then go through the sprinkler system."
2,To hard to turn the water off and on.,We bought this to go with the Scarecrow Motion Activated Sprinkler.I didn't care for them because the little off and on knobs were to hard toturn.
1,A defective product.,"Shortly after installing it, the black plastic connector started to leak. The plastic piece had very fine pin holes invisible to the eyes until the water started to spray out of them. Fortunately I didn't spend a fortune, but still, hated wasting time and money."
5,Worked like a charm.,"I have two different sections of yard that needed to be watered so this worked perfect. I must say that although the top is plastic, a little plummer's tape prevented any leakage and so far has worked great. I use the on/off valves daily and have not had any issues with them becoming loose or giving me any issues. For the price this was a great buy."
3,Works OK,"This is a handy gadget when you want to use an outdoor faucet for two different feeds. It is made in China of solid brass. We have been warned many times about health issues concerning materials used in China. This is no exception and has a warning that it is known by the state of California that this can cause cancer. Hands should be washed thouroughly when handling this item.Installation is very easy using the plastic gripper that surrounds the brass faucet connection. So far it has not had the leaks that other reviewers have experienced. The shut-off valves are not particularly well designed and are somewhat difficult to operate.Overall, there is nothing especially noteworthy nor particularly negative about this product aside from the cancer causing. It functions as expected and has a fairly reasonable price tag."
4,A good product,"All of our big box stores, and even the nurseries, only had the plastic connectors in stock so we went online to find something a little more durable. This does a good job at it's core function. When installed with Teflon tape (plumbers tape -- use it!) I didn't have any leaking at all.The valve handles can be a little tight to turn at first but seem to have loosened up the right amount over the last few months.The flanged collar that's intended to make it easier to connect, doesn't. The little nubs you're supposed to grip to turn the collar bend and are flimsy. If you have an application where you can't get in front of the spigot you might have a little more trouble putting this on, but it's not worth skipping it over.It's a good product and seems solid, I'm hoping for many years of use from it."
1,Does not work,"I may have gotten a bad one, bit this connector's off and off knobs DO NOT TURN! So there is no way to turn them from off to on making this a totally useless product. Waste of time and money. :("
1,Junk,"This is a piece of junk, water sprayed out from both sides of the connector and the valves were impossible to turn. I wasn't able to use it even one time. I threw it out."
5,No Leaks,I like this and it does the job. No leaking after a years use so I am happy with it. Needs a bit of W D 40 after awhile but thats expected. Good buy!
4,"Very nice, but has a small leak","This is a very good quality connector. I've been using mine for about two weeks but it has a very small slow leak. It's such a slowly dripping leak that it really makes no difference for me, and it certainly is a 100% improvement over the plastic ones. This connector is very heavy and very sturdy."
3,It does the job,The 2-way connector works fine. The only problem I find is that the on/off knobs are so close together it is hard to turn them. I am not the strongest person and it takes a few tries before I can turn the left knob on. Other than the little glitch I find the product sufficient to do what I bought it to do.
1,Contains Lead--not for drinking water use,I got this for my RV thinking it would be more heavy duty (my brass/plastic camco verison broke). I realized after i received it that it contained lead. There are some that do not contain lead that would be better for drinking water.
4,Better than anything I've found locally.,"Although I'm not crazy about Gilmour products,(I own several of their sprayers) this all brass water splitter is better than anything I've found locally. The valves seem to be better constructed and are much easier to turn. It also seems to be a better value. Can't give it a five star because I haven't had it long enough to put it through the ""time"" test."
4,Seems well made.,Seems to be brass in and out except for the black plastic ring on the outside used to turn the threads and screw onto the faucet. The threads inside the plastic are brass though. Better made than I expected given some of the reviews.
3,loose,"This product comes loose very easily, so you have to constantly fuss with it. However, it does not leak when in place."
4,Functional,"This product arrived as advertised, is of adequate quality manufacture, and materials. For the price point, this product is exactly what you're looking for."
5,"High Quality - great ""action""",The thing feels like a quality piece of metal vs the plastic junk it replaced. I particularly like the feel of the ball valve itself. It is smooth and feels like a high precision piece of gear that might actually be easy to turn after a year of use. Fingers crossed!
4,High quality splitter for your water spout,"We bought this to attach a Scarecrow to our garden water spout and a garden hose to avoid the hassle of switching the hose connections when we wanted to use one and not the other.The brass switches are a little difficult to turn, but the connector is hefty, high quality, and it does not leak at all."
5,Very fun to read!,The book is great my 5 and 3 year old love the book it rhymes perfectly well and it helps children remember words easier. We got this book as a Christmas gift from my friend and ever since I read it to my children every night. My three year old loves it and says it's his favorite book!
5,Huevos verdes con jamónHuevos verdes con jamón,I bought this book for my granddaughter who is learning Spanish. It is a great book to teach your children Spanish. It was a great price and speedy delivery.
4,Muy Bien,"Dr. Seuss's rhymes are hard to translate into Spanish, especially in books full of made-up words; they either don't maintain proper poetic rhythm, don't rhyme properly, or just don't make sense- a great example of this is ¡Cómo el Grinch robó la Navidad!, the translation of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. When the first sentence refers to los Quienes en Villa-Quien... yeah, no. I'm annoyed just thinking about it. But because Green Eggs and Ham in general uses simpler vocabulary (Dr. Seuss was dared by his Editor to write a book using only 50 different words), and the words are very common words that don't need strange translation, this translation is actually wonderful and flows properly as a poem and a story. A great read in the classroom, because most students are well-familiar with the story."
3,Not a very good translation,"To introduce my son to multiple languages, I have purchased this book in english, french and spanish. While the french version is very well translated and even has rhyming, I can not say the same about the spanish version. I really think I could have done a better job translating this book, and I'm not even a native spanish-speaker. If you're using the book as a language aid, it's fine, but if you're looking to recreate the fun of the original english version, this translation is not the one."
5,Fun!,"As a 25-year-old still learning Spanish, this was a fun book to read through. I thought it was a cute translation of the original, and it was a great step into Spanish Literature. Good job to the translators for making it rhyme so well while keeping the integrity of the book! It made me smile."
4,Well worth it,"During our school's celebration of Dr. Seuss' birthday this March, a Spanish speaking friend came in to read this version of Green Eggs and Ham. We gathered our Spanish speaking students, and he read the story in a kindergarten classroom after they had heard the English version. It was a totally enjoyable experience for all."
3,complicated read,i purchased go dog go for my son and he loved the spanish version. so i decided to go with green eggs(since i have read it over 50 times)and it was not as easy to follow and the words were a little difficult to relate. i can speak a little spanish and read a little but this book left me struggling.
3,It's a little too long and annoying.,By the middle of the book i just don't wanna read it any more it gets annoying and my son starts wiggling of he's only one and an avid reader with short story board books but once i get to the middle of this one he's just not having it i guess it's to long for him and annoying to read for me it's all the same thing after and after page huhhhhh!!! or aaahhh!!! no more eggs with ham allready!!!
2,New meaning of artistic license,I was very unhappy about the license take by the translators. It is unbelivable how much they decided to add and take away to maintain the rythm. They should have worked harder at it or refused to translate if it is not possible to maintain the integrity of the work.
2,Not significantly informative,"I purchased a used copy so myCost did not influence my review.This book does not provide more insight than one could obtain asking questions and research on line. The person I suspect who would purchase this book, might be the same type of person who makes decisions by theirPersonal dictates versus those who make their decision influenced by the funeral industry."
1,Useless,"The buttons don't work. One buys a stopwatch to get accurate times down to the split second. Well, when it takes five tries to get it started, and then three to stop it, it defeats the purpose. Very frustrating. Not to mention the times when it starts and stops on the same press.Completely useless piece of equipment that I have since discarded."
1,Unreliable,"Liked the design of this stopwatch,large display and positive feedback click when depressing buttons. However if the stopwatch doesn't start or responds as if double clicked, whatever you wanted to time ends up being lost. Whether it is a design flaw or quality control the end result is I ended up with a piece of junk."
1,Horrible Product,This is the worst stopwatch I have ever bought. If I could give the product a zero I would. The start and stop buttons are too sensitive and when I say sensitive I mean you press the button once and it will start and stop in the same instance. If you try and press it quickly it won't respond. I have had to try and start it several time before I can get it to work properly. I dealt with this problem but not even 6 months later I cannot get the reset button to work it will start and stop the split time but will not reset. I viewed the manual online hoping it was operator head space but when I tried what the manual said it still did not work. I just trashed this product. Now about the whistle that comes with it; It is cheap to say the least. It doesn't have the ball in the whistle so it sounds funny and hurts the ears when used and a normal volume. I would not recommend this product to anyone and because the issues I had with this stopwatch I will never buy a Sportline product again.
1,Total piece of Chinese crap,"Buttons don't work, alarm will wake you up every morning at 1AM. In the garbage it goes. Don't waste your money."
1,Terrible,"I bought one of these at a Dick's Sporting Goods. The button mechanism did not work properly. The alarm could not be turned off (every night at 1:00am - BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!) I had to leave it in the garage so it didn't wake me up. When using the timer (that is if you can caress it into timer mode), it sometimes actually starts and stops when you push the button. Anyway, I took it back to the store and they replaced it. The new one worked better for about a week, now it also has all the same problems. So, I am here on Amazon to order a new one and Mr. Sportline is going in the dumpster! Too bad I can't give it a NO STAR rating."
1,Not a good product.,We purchased eight of these for our soccer referees. One season is eight weeks of games. We stored the stopwatches for the next season. Only one of the eight works. The buttons stick and are unresponsive. Another model of Sportline was not much better. I will be looking for a different brand product for this season.
1,Waste of time,"I normally do not write reviews, but I am so annoyed with this stopwatch I felt compelled. This is the worst stopwatch I have ever used! The stop/start button worked okay at first, but now after one week has stopped reliably working and is not sensitive when pressed. I have also been annoyed by the beeping, but at least it can be turned off. The main problem is the unreliability of basic functions. Do NOT buy this. It is junk and should not be on the market. Mine is going in the trash."
2,Good for young artists only. More serious artists left wanting more.,"This book is good for young artists and young artists only. If you're a kid who just wants to enhance your doodling skills then buy this book! The markers it comes with are water based, cheap, and nothing like what the pros use. If you are over 13 or you are young but want to become a very serious artist do not buy this book! you should buy: How To Draw the Marvel Way by Stan Lee. That book is quite a bit more advanced and involved for drawing your favorite Marvel characters and for creating your own characters."
2,Poor design,The pump has a few design flaws which cause it to not operate properly. The control for water flow is located where the hose attaches thus it easily detaches from the top of the pump . The rubber suction cups do not work and the pump easily separates. I needed to place a rubber band around the pump to hold it together.
5,the best movie ever!,"I first saw this movie when I was about 9 and it has been my favorite ever since! Not only does it have an amazing and very talented cast, it tells a true story about the joys, pains, fears, hopes, and dreams of young women everywhere and of war-torn america. It is sweet, humourous, bitter, and I cry every single time I see it (and I mean, I barely EVER cry at movies!) If you have not seen this movie, SEE IT NOW!"
5,one of the best!,"This movie is one of the best i've ever seen. Yes, it may be a little dated, but it's REALLY good! A league of their own also shows a good example of friendship, leadership, and women in sports. i encurage you to watch this video, at the very least. = )"
4,A different novel,"I liked this book because it was different in setting, plot, and characters. The writing is excellent. I did find some parts of the story hard to believe and the main character, Emily, is a study in contrasts that are a bit too extreme. But I enjoyed the setting - the 1920's in Australia, Paris, Chartres, and Tunisia. The descriptions were well-written without becoming tiresome. The ending was disappointing to me. It was predictable, but unbelievable."
4,Solid,So far so good! I have changed over all of my quick connects to the Gardena system. I use plumber tape on ALL connections. Not one leak yet! Happy in OK!
5,Watering Made Easy,Anybody who is still walking back to the spigot and twisting the end of a cold dirty hose eveytime they want to move a sprinkler is living in the last century. With the WATERSTOP connection you do not have to turn off the water every time you change attachments or add or delete hose. You can change attachments while while the hose system is fully pressurized while wearing your dress clothing; it is that simple and clean.
4,Repeat Purchase,"I would give this five stars, but the reason I am a ""repeat purchaser"" is because I tend to break the main unit once per year. This is not an easy thing to do, as it requires a fairly heavy (all metal) sprinkler device connected to it and a few drops on the sidewalk, or a car backing out of the garage. I am now on my fourth set in six years. Still, I love it and keep buying it."
5,Excellent starter kit,"This has saved me so much time outside converting the hose from one device to another so easily. And I love that when I disconnect it from the device, it automatically shuts the water off so I don't have water running out of the end of the hose. And it's great for quick connection to the faucet since I don't leave the hose reel outside. Very easy to install and use. Paid a little over $8 on Amazon... what a bargain!!"
2,Gardena plastics not the best,"I have been using Gardena products for some years and my heart sunk with the initial realization, after having purchased hundreds of dollars worth of their watering equipment, that the plastic is not strong and durable. My opinion is that the pricing is fairly ""premium"" so the plastic should also withstand the test of UV radiation and time. But it doesn't. I found that some of the products have weak points that will snap off if not always mindful of lateral forces. Secondly, the plastic gets brittle after a couple seasons in the sun and will not tolerate being stepped on or dropped on a hard surface. Would I do it all over again? No. I would spend the money up front on brass and not have to spend any more. You get what you pay for. If using plastic, I think it would be better to run with competitor plastic, such as Gilmour, as they are cheaper."
3,Nice but after a few months they break,"I really liked this product however there is a flaw with the end that connects to your nozzle, etc. After a few months it weakens and cracks."
2,Drips,I've owned this for more than a month. I use it to switch between my sprinkler and hand nozzle. The quick-release gasket leaks now. It's no fun to water my hanging baskets with water dripping down my arm.
3,smaller than expected,"Although the size is written, it is still smaller than expected. If you want to use it as yoga, it is really good. If you want to sleep on it, it is not big enough."
1,Received wrong dimenson mat,"The description for this mat is 24"" x 72"" but what I got was 21"" x 34"" dimension mat. There was no place on Amazon to write to the seller to check if the correct dimension mat could be sent instead. I wrote to Amazon customer service and got an email reply to say that ""this item was placed with Get Organized, a seller on our website. Because Get Organized's inventory is constantly changing, we can't replace items sold by them that are Fulfilled by Amazon."" I really needed a long mat which the length 72"" would be great and the answer by Amazon does not help. How do I go about getting the correct dimension mat as described by the website ??"
1,Gardena 36938-12 Twin-Cap Connector,"I like and go to great lengths to find Gardena watering products. K-Marts, Wal-Mart, & Worms Ways stopped carrying them in my local area so mail-order is the only way. Most carry, I think, life-time guarantees, but you may need to check ahead of purchase and keep sales receipts for years to enforce that guarantee on the better products. Cheaper ones like this you may pitch the receipt and then lose out. My Gardena 36938-12 Twin-Cap Connector cracked in the first sason of use at the Y-branch and no glueing could save it. You probably will be better off buying a brass fitting. Be sure it is brass and not plastic coated with a brass or metalic surface."
4,Listening to Resistance,"In her book she discusses poetry and literature which carry messages of protest. It is a powerful book and makes one think about the voices contained within each piece. Voices from those in the margins and people who wish to be heard, but for one reason or another their work is not being marketed or discussed in the mainstream market. It will leave you with a strong message. It is a must have."
2,"Cute, Not Accurate","This is really cute book, telling the story of Jesus' birth through children putting on a play (though it was not obvious to my 4 yo they were putting on a play)...and it even explains at the end that is why we celebrate Christmas each year. I love that it connects the then with the now.I would not want this as my only source of the story of Jesus' birth because of two flaws when compared to the biblical story. First, Mary and Joseph were not married (Luke 1:27), and this book says they were. Second, the wise men came to see Jesus at the stable, and not at the home of Mary and Jesus. (Matthew 2:11).Granted, both of these mistakes happen often in the retelling of the real Christmas story, but I wanted those who cared to know before purchasing."
5,throne of thrones,"I can't complain about this stool. It is very sturdy. It is not what I ultimately need, but there is nothing wrong with the chair itself. I would prefer something with a back of some size/kind. But it is a rock solid throne!"
5,Is it Really New?,"This review is not about the drive itself. It's good product. I've been burned buy a seller here on Amazon who sold me drives they claimed were new. Instead, they were used for more than three years. One was even formatted already. Foremost found lots of nice data!Use smartmontools and a cable to test whether the drive is new. Smartmontools does not lie. Why? the drive stores the number of hours the drive has been in use and smartmontools gets this information out of the drive. There's no excuse! There's even a Windows executable of smartmontools."
2,Star Trek,Unless you are a true fan it's not worth owning. There are some redeemimg qualities but it is poorly done.
2,Well,"cjr2 is obviously a Star Trek fan, so you can't listen to him. Star Trek is long and boring and is what the nerds at your school watch. I'm not a Star Wars fan either, but I liked the movie. I tried to like Star Trek but can't seem to stay awake during any of the episodes or movies, and I've seen every one. Star Trek will never beat Star Wars. Period!"
2,Breaks easily,"My son received this as a gift on his third birthday. It is cute and he had fun with it. However, less than a month after receiving it the back broke while playing with it. It is not a durable toy and it will not last long with normal three year old play."
1,fell apart,"I bought a few of these trucks for my son for Christmas, and every one of them fell apart the minute he started playing with them. I could not believe it! He was distressed and I wasted money. Oh well."
3,The Magic Lens,The Magic Lens I purchased was pictured as the green Vol. 3 that I needed but I wassent the yellow Vol. I. I was disappointed but couldn't take the time/energy to return it.
1,Very disappointing...,"Machine did not work...at all. When I shipped it back, I was charged a 25% restocking fee that should have been waived since the machine didn't work and was never mentioned in the first place. Credit took 45 days to hit may account."
3,Good printer but feeder doesn't always work correctly,"This laserjet prints great but when I have to fax more than one sheet, a lot of the time the feeder faxes all of the sheets at one time. So I have to literally hold unto each sheet to ensure that the feeder doesn't take them all at once. Than there are other times it faxes the way it's suppose to. I don't use it as a scanner or copy machine since I have different printer for that."
3,Document feed was a problem,"I wish I had a $1 for every time I faxed a multi-page fax and the recipient called to indicate a page was missing. Because the document feed was unreliable, I did not use it to scan documents and decided to switch to a digital fax service to send my faxes. I kept it around so I could use it to make copies, but then recently sent it to college with my son. The printer performed adequately as a copier and a printer."
4,Had a difficult time making the scanner work.,"I previously owned a couple of HP electronic products and I was satisfied with their performance. I wanted a multi-function printer so I bought the Laserjet 3015.The first time I installed the software, I had no problem with the printer, copier and fax functions. But I could not get the HP Toolbox to load and the scanner would not work. For three mornings, I was on the phone with HP support, trying to figure out how to solve the problem. I downloaded exe files from HP's website and installed them as instructed but that did not help. It was only after the third try and working with a third support rep that I was finally able to make it work.My only wish is that I bought a system with a flatbed scanner but for the price, I can live with what I have. It's now working fine with me and I am happy."
2,Your XP machine will never go on standby again,"I have owned a lot of HP printers and such over the last 20 years. There's no problem with this machine that I care to harp on, but the SUPPORT SOFTWARE has a BUG that PREVENTS Windows XP from GOING ON STANDBY. Your machine will just sit there like an idiot, displaying the error message and failing repeatedly to go into power-saving mode. THE PROBLEM IS KNOWN to HP, but their suggested FIX DOES NOT WORK no matter how many times you download and install updated drivers, NOR DOES THE COMPANY RESPOND to e-mail or voice messages about the problem. This has been going on for several months for me. Not happy."
1,Wrong didge for this person to play?,"I did not care for this dvd.It covers some good subjects for learninghow to play?However the didge work is very weak,the didge used for examples, was I believe to large of bore for this person and should have never been used.I gave up watching about half way in to the dvd.I felt that this dvd should not have been releaesed to the public."
1,rent this one,"Narnia has great graphics...and thats the only really good thing it has going for it. The gameplay is boring and repetitive. The story is chopped up so much to not too much of the movie away that it really dosent make sense. Defiantly rent this one, but I dont recommend buying."
1,Can't play the game!,"We have a six month old HP computer system. Imagine our surprise, when on Christmas day, we loaded the Narnia game only to be told that it required ""Pixel Shader"" in order to operate. Sure enough, this requirement is listed in small print on the bottom of the box, but we sure didn't notice the bottom of the box BEFORE we opened it. Check your system to make sure you can meet the minimum requirments!Requirements of this type should largely advertised both on the front of the box, and on the advertisements/descriptions so that there is no ugly and potentially costly surprise."
4,An Interesting Glimpse into Life in Rural France,"Mary Moody writes with verve and honesty about her need to escape on her own, to take a break from her frantically busy work and family life, and to experience life in rural France. She takes the reader on a journey into the Lot, where her descriptions of country life sparkle. Her insights into family life and her own reasons for 'running away', as she terms it are interspersed throughout the story. I found it a fascinating read, and although it didn't make me want to run away myself, my desire to explore those areas has escalated. An enjoyable memoir."
4,Great slide for wide feet,"I had to return the shoes since my feet are very narrow, but I loved the way they looked and felt on my feet. They'd be great for anyone with a normal to wide foot."
1,"Clunky, bad fit, hated the gel insert","I really did not care for these shoes, made my feet hurt. The gel insert felt lumpy. I also did not care for the bright pink stripe."
2,Will someone please make some decent DARK Brown Cork Boards?,"Yes, these are flimsy and crumbly, and the adhesives don't hold the damned cork tiles up. And they charge and outrageous price for shipping such lightweight materials. A real rip off. Yet I cannot find any other DARK BROWN cork tiles out there. They all apparently come from the same place and charge high shipping rates. Someone should manufacture a better product."
1,Too Crumbly,"These cork tiles are a good thickness, but they are very crumbly. The consistency of the cork is much looser than that of a typical cork board. I would love to find good quality dark cork, but this isn't it."
2,"Thick enough for tacking, slightly crumbly open texture, sticker pads don't hold","The basic material seems fine and if you approach it knowing that the 'sticky' pads won't actually affix this to any surface then it will probably suit you just fine. I cut a piece of 1/4"" foam-core slightly shorter than the length of the four panels side by side and used construction adhesive to adhere the cork to the foam. I then used sticky backed velcro to adhere the foam to the wall surface. This has held up very well under load."
2,Extremely Cheap,"Not happy with these at all. Should've listened to previous reviews. They are extremely flimsy and started falling apart as I removed them from the packaging. The adhesive won't stick to them, so one fell as I was hanging and broke when it hit the carpet. At least they were cheap and look good (dark), but I wouldn't waste my money if you actually want to hang anything on them."
1,Waste of money,"They look good and they're relatively thick.Unfortunately, they are extremely flimsy.Further, the adhesive squares included for hanging them did not stick to the cork panels. Unfortunately, they did continue sticking to my walls once the cork panels fell off.Now all I have is a bunch of broken cork panels (they broke when they fell) and numerous adhesive squares I have to pry/scrape/steam off my wall.Might have worked better if I'd hammered them in place. Too late now.I don't recommend this item."
4,Meh,"They don't hang with adhesives provided, so I used command strips. They are kind of curved, but that's only obvious if you hang it curving away from the wall. They are very delicate- if you drop them they will probably fall into pieces. Be very careful when handling these. On a positive note, the color is very unique and expensive-looking. It adds an artsy element to my room. I use it to hang my jewelry and it keeps it very organized. I've had them for a few months and so far, they are still intact. It's a great price, so don't expect too much. Handle with care!"
1,Too thin to hang anything on!,"I installed these with no problem but then discovered they're too thin for regular pushpins - the pushpins only go halfway in, so can't tack anything to the NINE SQUARES I painstakingly hung up... arrrggghh.... Would not recommend. Just spend the money on a big regular bulletin board. I got these from a big box store fyi."
4,Just what I was expecting,These tiles are good quality for the price. I would reccomend buying mounting tape to hang them rather than using the mounting squares that come in the package. We used the provided squares to start with and most of them fell off the wall. The cork tiles are quite thin and several of them broke when they fell. After buying a heavier duty mounting tape we were able to create a custome cork border for my daughters room that looks very nice.
2,Not for use with a newer MAC,"This product was distributed in 1995, thus the software is only compatible with ""Classic"" Mac OS. It does work with Windows XP because it can run the software in Windows 95. The games seem a little old compared with today's technology, but they are still great educational games."
4,"Extremely nice, but...","This CD is a very enjoyable collection that depicts a certain era of music. But what's missing is the balance between American and British songs. Yes, that's right. There are few British songs, a thing which is not so good, because the picture you get is not complete. How about a volume 2 being released?"
1,Not helpful and WAY too much $$$$,Do not waste your money on this book. The Oxford English Dictionary proved itself much more thorough and useful.
3,Electronic Metro Triple,The bundles seems to be ok with the exception that the 700W attachment does not seem to work with my new Verizon cell phone called the Entice which is a W755. Any suggestions?
1,Do NOT Buy This Item,"This thing is a piece of JUNK. The cigarette adapter did not fit into my lighter and the thing broke after very limited, ONE DAY use."
5,One charger for everything!,"Great charger, had an important conference call and my phone was dying and I was in the airport, plugged two nine volt batteries into the charger and finished my conference call. Plus this charger works internationally as well and I didn't have to carry all those awful chargers around for my ipod and treo when i was overseas for business! Works in your car and in an outlet also. Great product good price. You can also buy more tips/adapters at their home site, which is a added value so i don't have waste anymore money on other chargers when i get a new cellphone. Less mess"
5,Music to my ears,I hadn't heard fusion music in years. I've been out of touch but thanks to YouTube I've made some nice discoveries recently. One of them was a video featuring the live gig of Sakurai and the Gentle Hearts tour. I love the playing and the compositions on this CD. The band is hot and they sound really great. I've also bought a solo CD by Howe and another by McAlpine thanks to this first discovery. I was actually surfing around looking for any music with Dennis Chambers on drums. I thought fusion had gone away but I'm happy that it's alive and very well. I've already played this CD many times over.
4,Lucid and Insightful,Although the title of the book is misleading this is compensated by the content of the essays that are well thought out and researched. There certainly maybe areas that require further research and study but the same can be said for any area of academic endeavor. Most pleasurable is the style of writing adopted which makes the reading easy and engrossing. The author appears to come to Islam with a sympathetic ear and this is a relief after the hostility created by 9/11. This book is worth a read for those interested in Islam and South Asia.
1,Weak light output.,Light output is less than half when compare to OEM bulbs. Don't waste money on these bulbs.
2,Weak light,I installed these as parking lamps in an 02 Mini Cooper. The blue white light is cool but the amount of light is much weaker than the bulb I replaced.
5,Nos is Boss. Oh my God yes it is.,"I have to admit that when I initally bought this CD that I only like one song. The second track, Um Historia De Ifa. In fact everytime I went to the Tower Records listening booth I listened to it again and didnt care for the other songs. I hated buying a CD for one song. Well I broke down and bought it and to my surprise its more beautiful than fantasy or euphoria or Egypt. I just love this womans voice. Definately she loves her African roots and doesnt miss a beat. The best way to enjoy this CD is after a bubblebath and lying down in your favorite candlelit room. This CD is so pretty. Spread love and buy it. Steven In Oakland."
5,Get it now!,"Brilliant highly reccomend this cd. A woman with a strong voice, deep passion for music and for the soul."
2,buena voz... pero no parece musica brasilera,"rodriguez canta los temas de este cd en forma suave, melodiosa, y para mi gusto bastante monocorde y con pocas diferencias entre ellos. Escucharla, luego de ver reiteradamente las opiniones favorables en eeuu, me decepciono. Si uno desea escuchar baladas bien entonadas con lucimiento vocal, sin ritmo, es un muy buen cd. Si a uno le gusta la musica que ha hecho famosa brasil en todo el mundo, debe comprar cualquier otro cantante de brasil, pero no esta sra.Si no le dicen que es brasilera creo que nadie podria adivinarlo. Quizas por esto, su repercusion en brasil es tan limitada, y se la aprecia donde el ritmo de brasil no es usual, o por gente que no lo conoce o no le gusta. Yo compre ambos cd y los cambio por una grabacion callejera de rio de janeiro"
5,Only Five Stars? ......,"This is one time I wish Amazon had a twenty star rating. Here is one truly amazing voice and talent that will live up to the ""buzz"" surrounding ""Nos."" Like West Africas' treasure, Cesaria Evora, Virginia Rodrigues will become Brazils'voice. Her voice erupts from the depths of Brazils soul. Supported by a delicate production, instruments and voice are combined perfectly to provide a sensuous, relaxing and reverant recording. This is one not to miss."
5,SUBLIME,"When you put together great voice and great music the result couldn't be other than this. I just got into Brazilian music since I thought it would be a didactic experience for me since I'm learning the language. Well, I'm happy to say that this CD exceeded my didactic expectations and delighted me with the innocent voice yet glamorous and the soft meaningful music yet heart-touching. I'd love to watch her performing live. But it is thrilling enough to have this CD and enjoy her voice anytime I want"
3,Interesting if overly academic book,"As a Bloomington resident and a long-time admirer of Kinsey's work, I decided it was time to learn more about the man beyond what the Liam Neeson film taught me. What I found in Gathorne-Hardy's bio was a solid portrait of a man who opened the world's eyes to sexuality. The book is well-researched and interesting, but at times it can get bogged down with a bit too much analysis of Kinsey's motives and correspondence, especially as it pertains to his own sexuality.Still, the book is an easy read and well sourced, and it certainly provides an informative biography of Kinsey while acknowledging some of the man's flaws."
3,pretty good coverage of late medieval art,"The 12th century seems to have been the beginning of an era of change for Europe with the crusades.The video has pretty good coverage of late medieval art with fresco, perspective, architecture,styles and early oil painting.The treatment of shading and life drawing could probably be better.I'd say it was a good review and you get how to pronounce of the nameswhich doesn't come from just reading books about art history.This one ends at about the time of Da Vinci.I liked it, even with the British high tone curator lectures."
1,Go back to school,"No reputable historian ever uses the term ""Dark Ages"" since this is an inaccurate and pejorative term for a period in which art and learning were thriving in Byzantium and many places in western Europe (Ireland, for instance). Moreover, anyone who places Van Eyck in the Middle Ages is simply an ignoramous and should not be passing him/herself off as an expert on any aspect of history. It may be that these errors do not occur within the DVD under review, but are merely the gaffes of whoever wrote the ""editorial review"". I haven't actually seen ""Landmarks of Western Art"" and the review does not encourage me to do so. I guess this might disqualify me from writing a review, but after all, this is Amazon.com-- since when do reviews have to be written by people who've actually seen the product?! Just check out books by writers like Kate O'Beirne, whose work has been subject to a massive free-for-all of mud-slinging from people who clearly have never read a word of it."
3,no response from vendor,"The watch is fine, but the wrist band size was too big, I have been trying to contact the vendor for return or exchange and I haven't gotten any response yet."
1,I was DUPED! Received Imitation Honeywell Filter HC-15 !!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! THIS IS NOT AN ORIGINAL HWF65 HOLMES FILTER! I RECEIVED A HONEYWELL HC-15 WHICH DOES NOT THE METAL MESH AS PHOTOED! THIS PRODUCT IS SLIGHTLY TOO TALL AND MY HM1889 HUMIDIFIER FILTERCHECK DOES NOT REGISTER AS A GOOD FILTER! I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED, ESPECIALLY SINCE I PURCHASED A HWF65 HOLMES FILTER IN 12/2008 AND RECEIVED AN ORIGINAL HOLMES FILTER!"
4,Dissapointed,"I thought that I was buying a Holmes filter, but was dissapointed to find that I received an imitition."
1,Poor product -- not the original filter,The photo and the descriptions of the filter are misleading. It is a low-quality filter without the original mesh screen that surrounds the filter. Mold and rust will developed after 10 days of use.
3,"Generic filter at a good price, but....","The filter did not fit in the humidifier as well as the original one did. The filter gauge did not reset, so it still reads ""Replace Filter"". It does, however, work just fine. It was a bit of a challenge to round it out to get it to fit correctly in the unit(as it comes flat in a box). It does the job for a fair price and they are hard to find locally."
1,Mold,Mold quickly developed on the filter after only 2 weeks of regular use. The filter was not just sitting in water either. There was proper circulation moving through out the unit and was not placed in a basement. It also should be noted that the humidifier used is in excellent condition in a home that is only 2 years old.
1,poor quality humidifier replacement filter,"Relacement filter does not have a mesh screen that surrounds the filter;the original Holmes filter does.This filter lasted only 10 days in running the humidifier,then it was useless.My original Holmes filterslasted approximately one month.This purchase was a waste of money."
3,This is NOT the original Holmes filter,"I bought this filter because it is a Holmes filter... but it is actually a generic one. It works, but I am not happy with the false advertising. I also disliked a lot that I purchased 2 items at the same time from this seller and I was charged DOUBLE shipping because shipping charges apply to every item purchased - sigh-, so I will NOT buy from this seller again."
4,Holmes Humidifer Replacement filter,"Not Bad. My Pop lives in Las Vegas and he has to run his humidifiers around the clock. I'm his go to guy because he doesn't have a computer. These filters can last about 35 days. After that, They're paper."
2,Not worth it,"The shipment arrived quickly, but the 2 filters I ordered are not anything like the genuine Holmes HWF65 as far as their ability to wick the water from bottom to top of the filter. Turning the filter upside down so the whole surface is wet helps for maybe an hour before the filter dries out again. I bought a Holmes HWF65 locally to compare it and it works as it should with the whole filter remains wet bottom to top making the humidifier work properly. As a result, I gave the 2 filters a toss."
1,"Wrong size, bad materials, total waste of money.","The way this style humdifier works is by pulling air through the wet filter and blowing it out to the room. If the air doesn't get pulled through the filter, no moisture makes it to the room. The filter must be sitting in the water in the tray, and must make contact with the bottom of the fan so the only route for the air is through the filter.These filters are a bit short. So they don't touch the bottom of the fan. So the air just cruises right over the top and dries out the filter in the process. In the meantime you still have a room with 25% humidity because all your humidifier is doing is blowing dry room air out the top.I'm ordering Holmes filters from now on."
4,Humidifier replacement,"The filters work fine, the price was great. The only disappointment is that they were not Holmes, but a generic thereof."
1,Mold,Used the humidifier off and on for about two months. In that time the filter has turned to nothing but a molded mess. Very displeased with the product considering I was using it for my infant child. I will be investing in another product and will not be recommending this product to nobody.
2,Wick Up,This product will not wick up enough water and loads up to fast so you have toreplace it to often.
2,Replacement filter,"The product did fit my humidifier and was delivered promptly. However, it does not seem to wick the water very efficiently."
5,it's a replacement filter,It shipped with no hassles. It's a humidifier filter so there isn't much to say about it.
1,Did not get product - You suck,"I did not get the produce I ordered because you refuse to ship to Alaska. You suck! I have already purchased the desired product from another vendor that would ship to Alaska, and did. This is not the first time this has happened. It is not that complicated or expensive to ship products to Alaska. Other vendors do it just fine.D"
1,Don't last,Two of these filters stopped working after only 2 weeks in my humidifier. The older filters we had with a felt-like outer covering lasted much longer.
1,Does not work,"The filter is different, plastic and not a metal holding frame, and will not register as in the humidifier once installed.I think it is a generic replacement which is a rip off."
2,Half the price as retail but a quarter the life,The price was excellent but the durability was not. The wick/filter only lasts two or three weeks at best. The wicks/filter I purchased at a retail location lasted well over a month. I'm looking for an alternate source.
5,humidifier filters,Three replacement filters were about the same cost as one filter viewed on other sites. Filters were new and the right specification.
3,More-less figure,"Well the idea of the figure its really nice, a holographic darth maul, but hasbro didnt paint the face of darth maul so it has his characteristic Face paints and i also dont like that the lightsaber just has one side of the blades doesent have the two blades but it also has good things, this is the first holographic darth maul figure and it make it so cool, also the blue paint looks really nice and its easy to stand him on its own"
2,Disappointed,"I own the CD of this work that I enjoy quite a bit, unfortunately the Blu-ray recording of this work is from a later period and really doesn't match the quality of the CD and that's very disappointing. Yes, it's in surround, but the sonics just aren't there and the performance is definately below the performance of the CD."
5,organic gardener,I grow my own plants from seeds and this easy to hold waterer doesn't wash the seeds away. You can make the water come out in a mist or a fog or turn the water up high and the seeds still don't wash away. I love this watering tool.
4,Must Buy,This Book has been one of my greatest reading experiences it has been subtely combined with the portraits. The letters have been written with alot of passion and admiration and also with a certain amount of trust and comfort in one another. this is book is a must buy for all art lovers it will educate them immensely about the life nad works of on of the greatest artists to exsist and besdides that they will get an insight into the life of this great artist and human being.
5,great boxes. grade A,there a great product. i have a 5 of these per ammo type.great strong hinge stays shut and opens easily over all its mtm at there best.
5,Holds ammo,Not really too much to review on this product. It holds my ammo. It opens and closes easily. I will purchase more.
4,Ammo Box,"Good quality, hold 100 rounds . Labels provided. Very handy to grab a hundred rounds and head to the range."
4,Very interesting for its era.,"... The number of things the author had right - especially since he died two years before the first Atomic bomb - is almost frightening.This type of fiction appears to be out-of-genre for the author, best known for historical writings, but one can see in it the basis of his motivations, pre-Pearl-Harbor, concerning United States entry into World War II.Taken in context with its era, it is a very important work - ..."
5,Excellent post-apocalyptic literature,"For those who enjoy intelligent, symbolic literature, I highly recommend this. It is a brilliant commentary regarding the possible developments of humanity should we not become more responsible regarding the maintenance of our Earth and the relationships of our fellow humans."
3,Great book!,"I belive that the book ""By the Waters of Babylon"" was very insightful. When I was reading the book I realized that it took place in the future. Jon's charater seemed very courageous and wise. The main theme in the book would have to be that knowledge can have good and bad aspects on life. The story had to do with a Great Burning that occured a long time ago and a new civilization began called the Hill People. This story has a lot of foreshadowing and you need to use your knowledge in order to understand the book. It is related to the nuclear bombing that will or has occurred on Earth. The message states that too much knowledge can destroy a spirit and it is better to die with your spirit living on, then to die with no spirit at all."
1,sucky,i hated this book because it was too deep i didnt understand most of it. i think this would be better for adults to read.
2,Weird,"I guess this book is written more for adults, but I did not comprehend a lot of the story. It is set in the future after some kind of atomic bomb or war, and people are trying to start a new life. What I want to know is where the Hill and Forest people came from if all of civilization was wiped out. My teacher is making me read this. Personally, I do not enjoy science fiction books. I think it was good that that boy explored things that he was forbidden, and would rather die than lose his spirit. He learned a lot of important things for his life. But this is one messed uo book."
1,i was forced,"my class was forced to read this book, personally not interesting at all. sure there is alot of foreshadowing and stuff but the story seemed so bland...i like books that have the slightest bit of realistic facts to them...i dunno, it's up to you if you wanna read it."
4,"Provides insight into the world of ""Tommy"" and The Who","This video is a compliment to the wonderful compilation of music created by The Who. A must experience for any avid fan of The Who. It is somewhat reminiscent of the film "" The Kids Are Alright"" and shares some of the same footage. I am fortunate to have a copy on laser disc to be preserved well into the next century. Catch it if you can!!"
1,That's the most boring Who video I know of,Very disapointing. It's like a paid commercial to sell the Broadway version of Tommy. Nothing new to see here. Contains a few short (10 seconds at most) excerpts of live Who concerts.Don't waste your money and your time on this one.
2,It was just okay,"Having read all of Carl Weber's previous books, I was excited to read this. I have to admit I was very disappointed. It was just okay for me.... alot of drama in the 3 stories. Sad part is this is probably what people would do if they hit it big in the lottery."
5,Going to play my pick-it,"I read this page turner in what felt like a matter of moments. I really enjoyed the different styles of writing getting three books in one. Although, the topic was the same I loved the different tone and feel each author had to offer. This book makes us all feel like winning the lottery is within our scope. I going to play my pick-it right now."
5,Too good to miss,"This book is awesome. I really enjoyed it. If there's a book with Carl Weber's name on it, you should buy it. Weber's books are always a joy to read. You'll smile, laugh, cry, and scream. This book and every book he writes is a pleasure to read. Don't miss out, get this book."
2,Poor Read,Not what I expected. I will not buy any other of this author's books.. Poor writing and the plots or story lines were awful.
3,Carl Weber & Dewayne S Joseph stories were good!,"Carl Weber & Dewayne S Joseph stories were good! Who told Angel Hunter she could write? Her story was terrible. La Jill Hunt rode Carl Weber's coat tail so I counld not tell if she was good or not. Carl Weber is great; as well as, Dwayne S Joseph.......I am going to look more into Mr Joseph books....I read all of Mr Weber's books. Angel Hunter NOOOOO way."
4,Worth Every Dollar!,"What more can be said about Mr. Carl Weber, a master of creativity? This man's books touch me like no other's. Easy Street, his collaboration with newcomer La Jill Hunt was no exception. This story had me rolling and the twisted ending was baffling. With Carl as her mentor, I see great things happening for La Jill. What an extraordinary debut! Carl, please come to my area to promote Player Haters. I would love to meet you!Dwayne Joseph's story was off the chain!! I read his fast-paced, intense tale in one sitting. Shocking and exhilarating, motion picture style. This man has a way with words and is simply amazing.Although nicely written, Angel Hunter's story didn't quite hold me like the others. I see her developing in to an author of more caliber in time."
3,Not as good as the hype,"This book is mediocre at best. It's hard to believe that these are professional, paid writers. There are three stories about what happens when someone hits the lottery. The first was ok, however predictable. The second story entitled ""Ghetto Fabulous"" was written poorly. The ""speaking"" parts were unrealistic and the storyline was weak. The third story became so wordy I just wanted it to end. I don't understand the high ratings. I'm guessing a lot of teenagers are writing them."
5,Really Deserves More Than Five Stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This was the best book that I have ever read where all the short stories were good. Usually one story is good and the others are mediocre. It really doesn't surprise me because Carl Weber is involved. I can't really say I liked one story more than any other because they were all wonderfully entertaining.EASY STREET-If you liked Addicted by Zane you'll enjoy this story.GHETTO FABULOUS- If you enjoyed B-More Careful by Shannon Holmes you'll enjoy this story. And last but definitely not least ONE NIGHT SIX DREAMS-If you liked Shades of Jade by Gloria Mallette you will love this story. This author is going to do very well on the scene with his plot twists and turns. I salute all of these writers on a job well done.
4,I Loved It!,"This is the first book I've read by Carl Weber and I must say I enjoyed all three stories. My favorite was ""Easy Street"" because the ending was so unexpected. At first, I did'nt like the second story but after sticking with it until the end I was pleasantly pleased. Now the last story was one rollercoaster ride and shows what power money and greed can have on people. The book also contains an excerpt from Carl Weber's upcoming novel ""Player Haters"" which appears to be interesting. If you want to read something a little different than what's saturating our reading market I recommend ""A Dollar and a Dream!"" Great stories which have empowered me to keep the faith that my dollar and a dream will manifest."
5,This book has it going on,"The book was well written. This book gave you four flavors with one thing in common. It had me wondering what I would do if I hit the lottery. Kudos to LaJill, Angel, Carl and Dwayne on this brilliant masterpiece. I was mad it had to end so soon but its all good!! Job Well done"
5,Great,"I loved the whole book, and it's theme of the all mighty dollar. One story in particular that caught my attention was the ""Ghetto Faboulous"". That story was the best I hope to see more books like this in the future so that I can write about it later in the future Carl Weber keep up the good work."
4,Very Good...Don't Know how it slipped through the cracks,I've read pretty much all of Carl Weber's books and I am a big fan of La Jill Hunt but this was the first time I'd heard of this book and it was out for 4 years? Wow! I for the most part loved all the stories and they proved for the most part that money is the root of all evil. I really loved Carl & La Jill's collaboration and then the other newer authors had it going on as well. I'd love to read more stories by these authors and I love Carl Weber's short stories. He definitely should do more novellas and short story compilations.
3,Good While It Lasts,"I agree with most of what is written here: the mouse is stylish, and the single button is not a huge problem. I used this mouse for about a year but it has just stopped working. I think the problem is that the connection between the mouse and the mouse cable is somewhat weak. If you want to get this mouse, be gentle to it, and don't wind the cable around the mouse (for travel/storage purposes) like I did."
2,Don't Buy It,"This mouse came with my new G4 Computer. I don't like it. I draw a lot with my mouse in general and this does not work for me. I hate the fact that you have to push down the whole mouse to get a click. I found that my wrist gets sore and the mouse is cumbersome and is just not sensitive enough.It looks really cool, but that's about it.I recommend the Microsoft Wheel Optical Mouse instead. It's cheap and the shape is very complimentary to your hand. Two buttons and the wheel all work on Mac. Plus the cord is really long... for some reason Mac cords for mice and keyboards are so darn short.I don't recommend this mouse."
5,One Button Beauty,"I hear a lot of griping about this being a one button mouse, but for me me it's never been an issue. I actually prefer a one button to a two button with a scroll wheel. Moving my hand from the mouse to the keyboard helps to prevent carpal tunnel by keeping my hand in motion. Also the sleek design of a one button mouse is too good to pass up. Everyone who's seen my mouse agrees it's beautiful. How many other mice can you say that about?Scroll wheel? The 'Page Up' and 'Page Down' buttons as well as the arrow keys on the keyboard give me much quicker access to the information I need AND more percidse control. To me, there are no drawbacks to a one button mouse at all. If fact, I doubt I'll ever want a two button mouse again."
1,Amazon.com is too expensive,Don't let amazon fool you! I bought 30 rolls of 1000 at Sams'Club for 16.88! Amazon is too expensive!!!
1,WHAT???,"Almost $20 bucks after shipping charges for a pound of crackers? these things are great, but just go to your local grocery store bulk section and you can find them too for far cheaper than this!"
5,Music theory made practical,"This is a very good video. It goes beyond what the title implies.He covers chord progressions, song structure, and the circle of fifths and how they relate to the guitar. Also covered is chords and diatonic melody structures. He relates it all to to position in the scale so you can transpose to any key.It would be hard to say too many good things about this video. It demystifies how you actually use the dreaded music theory in a practical way."
5,Second one I've owned.,Love the brush! Never static! Second one I've owned. Lasted about 8 years before I had to replace it - you will not be disappointed.
4,No static!,So far it really has no static! The real test will be in the winter when New England get very dry and I have flynaeaysnand frizzy static hairs like crazy!
2,The problem is CIW. Forget the books and go with examprep,The problem I have with CIW is the certification itself was not developed based on industry standards for professionalism. The courseware is a poor way to prepare for the exam since the mapping is poor. This book is similar to the courseware. The CIW examcram is probably the best. If you want to pass the exam spend your money on the exam prep software which does a better job of covering exam items. I've used MeasureUp and it was quite good
1,May be helpful to people without this disorder,"Though this book appears to be true and sincere, it does little to address the issue of how the author actually ""Made it through the Rain"". I personally suffer from Panic attacks and Agoraphobia and I was hoping for advice of how to overcome my own anxiety disorders, This was not the case. While I could relate to much how the author describes this illness, it provides little insight into how to confront this disorder. This story may be helpful to provide information to people who do not have this affliction, but I found it to be of little use as a sufferer of this illness.While I sympathize with Mr. Sterling, I personally believe that sympathy does not solve this illness. Understanding it more important than feeling sorry for yourself and asking for the pity of others. I've have also lost much to Panic Disorder... If you do not understand panic disorder, buy it. If you have Panic disorder, it only provides more dark emotions and a cycle of failures."
1,Not what you think,"This book might be helpful to friends or family of people suffering from panic disorder/agoraphobia, or for people with the illness that need to feel that they are not alone. But, it is not an uplifting story at all, just a description of the shambles it has made of the author's life. Also, the book is written in a ""stream of consciousness"" type of style that is hard to read. The author does convey his ability to perservere but, gives very little insight into what makes him able to cope."
4,Very Insperitional,"I thought this book was very good. As It is a story of a manthat refuses to give up or give in to panic/ argrophobia, despiteall that he lost as a result.He wrote what ""really"" happened, as it was happening.I also liked that many books written on these subjects tellyou which medicines, therapy's to use. But this was not thecase it was a real true to life book.Robert Sterling Thank You for writing the ""real"" story.It has encouraged be to go on and forward with my life."
4,Robert Sterling I Made it Throught the Rain book,"A genuine, honest look at panic disorder...if anyone you know suffers from this, it is an eye-opener, mostly written as a diary Sterling also includes tips on cognitive thinking which is half the battle. I am glad i purchased this book as i did not know there was one out there like this until i looked on Amazon!"
2,Tudor's artwork hurts cute corgis.,"I was disappointed with this book. Ms. Tudor's artwork has a very unfocused method as if she is not seeing well what she has drawn. This makes the pictures difficult to feel close to. The colors in the book are rather dark and the corgis do not look adorable. Her artwork usually carries the text of the story. In this book it detracts from it. I have all her books, but I'm not keeping this one."
3,Why is the Christian Bible the only source for this book?,"Why does this book use a Christian Bible for the ""Old Testament"" parts? Could've used a Jewish Bible y'know!"
2,Interesting but only somewhat useful,"I have always been interested in clocks and clockworks. I am an engineer and the intricacies of clockworks, and watchworks, fascinate me. I bought this book hoping to learn about designing and building clockworks.However, the book is really more of a vanity press type of work - it's more about the author's history working with clocks than about the construction of them. There are several hand-drawn diagrams included, but they are more schematic in nature. I'm afraid that the book did not help me move in the direction I wanted to go.However, it should be noted that there is quite a bit of information available in the book regarding tower clocks, and some interesting information about designs the author has built."
1,Grubex doesn't work,I applied this product at the optimal time recommended by Scott's.I followed the application instructions to a tee including watering the product in.I had lawn damage this morning from armadilloes digging for grubs.Nuff said!!
5,Inspiration,"This book is a beautiful inspiration. I wish I could share it with everyone. If you are thinking about reading it, please do. It is an incredible true story of a fantastic journey by a man who was not only a great architect, but a selfless humanitarian.Nader was a wonderful man. I had the privilege to meet him and spend time at Cal-Earth, his school in Hesperia, CA. Those were some of the most memorable and best days of my life. He was a loving person with a real fire in his heart for peace and beauty."
5,Don't let the Alcoholic Hypnotize You,"This book is a classic, which I still turn to. The words I picked for the title of this review, represent a key thought from Michael Elkin's great book. Not only does Elkin understand how a family system is hurt and changed by chemical dependency, he brings fresh thoughts to the change process. I benefitted from, and still benefit from this book both as someone effected by others' alcoholism, as well as a psychotherapist doing family therapy. The exercises and thoughts in here both clearly (and sometimes strategically!) challenge readers to notice the damage from addiction, and how to help the familiy, even if the alcoholic is not prepared to enter recovery. Great book, definitely think it ought ot be on every helper's books shelf, and every family ""survivor"" too.If you have ever thought there is nothing you can do to change the dynamics in your family, or in yourself, this is the book for you."
5,Clean Dishes,"I've tried store brands that look similar to this, but these Cascade packs do a much better job of cleaning overall. Worth a bit more money, but quite affordable on Amazon nonetheless."
1,high phosphorus! bad for the environment,"Dishwasher detergents have escaped regulations that apply to laundry detergents, and contain very high levels of phosphorus. Bad for the environment! If you live around the Great Lakes and you've experienced the disgusting algae bloom this year, you're seeing a byproduct of phosphorus runoff. Do yourself and the environment a favor and buy low phosphorus dishwasher detergents. We switched to Seventh Generation brand (sold here on amazon), and it works just as well as the high phosphorus brands (and we're on well water with moderate hardness)."
3,Don't buy this in bulk.,"I bought these gel packs after cascade etched all my glassware because cascade is the only thing that has ever cleaned burnt on grease. Opening up hte bag, the fumes hit me again and probably shaved off my nasal lining. You don't want five bags of this stuff off gassing in your home."
1,Dissatisfied Consumer,"I bought this software to create slide shows for my wedding reception. After creating 4 different slideshows, I wasn't able to burn them onto aDVD like it promises. My first e-mail to customer service took 2 weeks for a response and I could hardly understand the response to my questions. The second e-mail to customer service took a month to get a response and all they told me was to call customer service and there would be a $25 charge!!! I gave up on the product long before that. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Worthless,First off I bought this item to create slideshows for high school projects. I thought I was stepping up by buying this product. So I bought Photostory on CD and DVD 2005. It loaded on my computer and I was never able to burn on to a dvd. I thought I had a lemon because it was really cool when every once and awhile it worked. So I then bought Photostory on CD and DVD 4.0. I was very dissapointed in the item. It was not a very good program. I then emailed customer service to see what (if anything)I was doing wrong. Finally after a long wait they told me to uninstall it the reinstall. This did not work. These programs were completely worthless. I would not recomend them to anyone.
1,How to Use Documentation is so poor is it almost impossible to use.,"The documentation on this software is very poor. The manual seems to tell you what it will do and give a brief explanation of how it should work. But step by step instructions and demonstrations of it's functions are missing. The steps are not intuitive so more instructions is needed. I have a fair amount of experience using this type of program. I consider myself to be well versed on the most complex features of programs such as Pinnacle Studio, yet after 2 full days of messing with this program and searching the manual and net for help I could not create a slideshow using any of the special features they proclaim to have.There are far better programs out there for the same price. I ended up buying ProShow Gold and love it."
5,Excellent Case,I use this case on my Dean Mini Jumbo and it fits snug. It comes with two lockable latches and three other latches on case. with the five latches it will keep the guitar safe in the case without the fear of the lid just coming open. the fabrick inside has a layer of foam between it and the outer case which give that nice cushion feeling. the color on the inside is black as well. I got my case with-in 5 days after ordering too!
3,Not very Value adding when comes to commodities,"I give Shipman the credit for tackling the history of several investment booms and smoothly explaining the phsycology and human factor behind hype. However, I don't see the book relevant when it comes learning about investing in commodities. I wish it explained more how to study the fundamental of each one instead of including an elementary schoolbook paragraph. If you have an investment background and know a bit about commodities, this is not for you. I would have rated the book higher had it been relevant to commodities as it claimed it was."
4,Very pretty!,"Looks just like the picture to me, if not better. I've only been wearing it for a few days, though, so I can't say anything to its durability."
1,letter tray,"I saw the picture and thought I would get a 3-tiered tray. I was disappointed to receive one single tray. That one tray was heavy and deep, but yet it was still too narrow to put a file folder in. Way overpriced for a single tray."
1,WHY would you do that??,"WHY would you have a picture of 3 trays when you are only selling one? We don't need a picture to show that the trays can stack. The single descriptor ""stack-able"" in the product information section would suffice. $25 for a single tray, which has the same organizational ability as, oh say, my bed, floor, shelf, bookcase, hand, counter, hamper, wine rack, etc etc. BASICALLY THIS IS USELESS!!!! WHY WOULD YOU SELL IT LIKE THIS?? And it came in a HUGE box. I'm talking 12"" x 12"" x 18"". for an object that is 15% the volume. FIFTEEN PERCENT. Why does your company exist?"
4,Very Easy to Understand,"I am almost finished reading Char's book and I really do find it interesting and easy to understand. She deals a lot with trusting our own intuition and how being ""psychic"" is a gift everybody has. I also like the way Char deals with our need to be careful when we are trying to contact spirits, because not every spirt is for our good. That goes back to my Christian upbringing about not talking to the dead, because you may inovertly deal with demonic spirits. Even though I myself really do not want to communicate with the dead, I did find her book quite interesting and very honest. She comes across as a person who has a lot of compassion on others and truly wants to help people. I do indeed recommend her book!"
3,IN SYNC WITH THE UNIVERSE?,"I recently saw the author on a ""Larry King Live"" televised interview where she held her own with four theologians including Deepak Chopkra. Her perspective on intuition and awareness made sense. In this book she further explains the value of being ""in sync with the universe.""You may not agree with her perspective nor her psychic readings adventures. I didn't. Yet Ms. Margolis' book opens a doorway to possibilities, and the inherent power within each of us to understand and navigate the currents of life more smoothly. This is a very interesting perspective, worth the read.Ms. Margolis writes ""life is a school, and we are here to learn lessons as co-workers with Spirit."" If that concept seems plausible to you, ---- after you finish reading this book, take a look at ""Many Lives, Many Masters"" by Brian Weiss, ""Journey of Souls,"" by Michael Newton, and Harold Klemp's ""The Language of Soul"" and ""How To Survive Spiritually in Our Times."""
1,A VERY INANE READ!,This book was very mildly entertaining at best. Most of the book is comprised of the author's high opinion of herself and her views. I once had a reading with Ms. Margolis and found that to be lacking of any real clairvoyance or substance as well. It was very sketchy with a lot of guesses and not many hits. Save your money or better yet call the psychic friends network!
1,dont waste your money,i thought this book was about how to talk to the dead all it said was say out loud the persons name i did and nothing happened also she talks abount her readings with people this book is like a filler its things you already know
2,Ghosted,"The writing is ghosted, not the subject. Char may be the real thing, but the overly labored ghost writing kills any real feeling of sincerity."
1,"Misleading title, void of substantive comments","I bought this book fully expecting that I would receive questions to those all-important concerns we all have about life after death. If I had seen this book in a store, I could have looked over the table of contents and immediately realized it was not for me.Instead, the book is highly padded with little anecdotes and general material that gets repetitive, but is highly disappointing in that it just doesn't deliver what its title promises. If I had seen this book in a store, I could have looked over the table of contents and immediately realized it was not for me.Save your money on this one!"
1,This book lacks any fundamental ideas,"I kept hoping this book would get better, but it didn't. With all due respect to Ms. Margulis, she can't decide whether she is a psychic or medium, and her words don't ring with the truth of really knowing about the other side. The title should be ""Questions from earth--answers from earth."" Very disappointing"
1,Boring and Commercialized to Say the Least,"This book did not seem to touch the heart of the matter at all! It read as a hardcover commercialized billboard directing people to overly expensive information, readings and websites with ""friends"" backing both.Yes, the work is interesting. And, we all interact within this world. But really...information coming through is going to be pretty much the same with the exception of the reader's strengths (what they specialize in). The search becomes in personality and who we connect with physcically or feel most comfortable in helping to understand and relay it.Honestly, the writer and information is very flat-lined! There are better books out there if you are really intersted in pursuing psychic abilities and development, I would search further.I personally would not purchase this book."
1,raspberry,"I give a hearty raspberry to this product. As others have noted, it leaks. And the male fitting sits so far down in some devices, you can't get a hold of the wrench ledges on it to completely tighten it in. Then the female fitting won't sit down well over the male because the device's leading edge is in the way. So you have to use washers to build out the male unit. After all that, the things still leak where the two fittings come together. Plastic quick connects don't have as much of a problem there, though they eventually crack and break. Which is why we go to metal ones in the first place. I have a brass one I bought several years ago, probably not a Melnor, but it doesn't have a brand mark. Unlike the Melnor, it is well built, fits good, and never leaks.And I can't figure out why Melnor uses the description ""Automatic Shutoff"", cuz all the 45C units I can find do not have the valve inside the female fitting. I'm both confused and dissappointed."
5,It's DVD time,"Surely it's time for this classic concert to be released on DVD!?This stripped back, it's-all-about-the-music performance is definitely a Utopia highpoint and definitely worth the DVD treatment."
1,"Horrible looking, bad video","It looks like the person in the DVD took his little home camera and recorded himself. I can't believe someone would charge money for this. You'd think someone based in Los Angeles could find a professional to shoot and edit the video. But considering that the information in it is worthless, I guess you don't get what you pay for, twice. Not recommended at all. Also, his guru/teacher/certifier just won the 2010 Scammy Awards..."
5,Photoshop Elements Solutions,"This is a great book for the nonprofessional who wants to do serious image editing on family photos, etc. It . The Adobe manual that comes with the program is one of the best from a software producer in that it explains the various features of the program quite well. Photoshop Elements Solutions picksup where Adobe's instruction manual leaves off in that it shows you how to combine the features sequentially to get to a great end product."
3,Decent but give me more...,"Okay, if you are like me you want PhotoShop but the price is more than your car payment, so you buy Elements. Of the 2 books that were available this is definitely the best. It includes (&explains) how to use filters and tools that can make a difference in your photos- ie. remove wrinkles on faces, remove glare on person with glasses. I found this to be a great reference and gladly recommend. Reason not more stars is that I'm waiting for something like The Bible of Photoshop Elements with great add-ons CD. I say buy this one-best of the bunch."
3,Photoshop Elements Solutions (With CD-ROM),"Although the information in the book was informative, and I leared a lot about the Photoshop elements, the quality of the book was not. I had the book for less that 2 weeks when it started to fall apart, with pages falling out and the binding coming apart. If they are going to have this book for use as a manual it should be better bound."
1,Frustrating - just doesn't work,"Well, maybe I am totally wrong but I just have had it trying to use this product... I don't know what is wrong... the OS X or the ViaVoice, but I have had it. The support is only during the day time hours... great tostay on the line for a large segment of your day waiting to speak to someone... calling some long distance number... so use email ... last email he wanted to know how many ""Favorates"" I had in Internet Explorer... This product works well for about 5 to 10 minutes ... then you start to talk to the wall... nothing works... bombs sometimes, abberrant behavior other times... accuracy is not too great... bought the Medical Vocabulary and it works well a while then God knows what happens... it goes into some funky state ... I can't get it to work.... It is just as bad as ViaVoice Millenian edition and just as slow... helps.....if.... you......talk.....like..... this.........ViaVoice Beta Version all over again -"
1,Didn't work under OsX 10.2.2,"Tried it on my new g5, under OSX 10.2.2. It never really ran enough for me judge how well it would work if it did."
5,"Warm story, admirable characters","I enjoyed this book a lot! It reminded me of an American Girl, but with more complex characters. The growing relationship between Emma and Mrs. Minshull, Emma's growing strength (both physical and mental), and her pride in her talent was neatly drawn. And just the right length for young readers! Would have liked more information about the canal life."
5,BIG HIT WITH ALL WHO READ,"I teach 5th grade...in NC. Keith Odom, the author ANDillustrator of MERVIN THE PURPLE SCHMOO is my cousin...I would lovethe book if I was not related. The story is sweet and the artwork is beautiful. I read it to my students and then they wanted to re-read it individually. (I can't read it with the expression Keith can.) My co-workers love the book too and want personal copies AND copies for their classrooms. Keith is a very talented person and a fine author/illustrator. I am completing my 27th year of Elementary School teaching and I've never seen such a good book. MERVIN and KEITH are great...Keep it up Keith."
3,"How to Fight, NOT How to Win","Bernbach's book is a useful primer on the mechanics of considering whether to file and how to file a discrimination based legal action. In that regard, it is practical and useful. It therefore fulfills one of its subtitle's promises - How To Fight.It does not substantively address the second promise - How to Win which is why I only give it 3 stars. While its case comments (not really studies) are interesting, there is little or no discussion of what can determine the ultimate success or failure of a legal action. For age discrimination cases, there is a much better book by Raymond F. Gregory titled ""Age Discrimination in the American Workplace - Old at a Young Age."" This book is very helpful in determining what it takes to win and presents more complete case studies in illustrating the important legal points and trends. This book, also available on Amazon, is not as procedural, so can best be considered an adjunct to rather than a substitute for Bernbach's book."
2,Job Discrimination II,"All I can say is, don't waste your time; too basic with no real meat. What is in this book can easily be extracted from the Internet.In fairness, if you are starting out as an EEO counselor in your workplace this is ok; or if you're just trying to be enlighten on the subject matter."
4,It's cute,Very cute umbrella! I bought this as a photography prop. They only thing I am not fond of is the metal handle - I'd prefer white.
4,Game for Daughter's DS,"My daughter plays this game and she seems to like it well enough. Sometimes she gets frustrated, but I tell her she has to persist and she does, so the game can teach commitment and problem solving as well. The game has some neat controls such as having to blow on the mic to influence the movement of Kim on a parachute."
2,"Pretty, but flawed.","First off, I imagined this to be much bigger than it really was. Secondly, the sipping edge flares out a bit and makes it tricky to drink from. And finally, the when drinking from this, you can't let drinks linger in it for too long else it'll leave a really nasty metallic taste to your drinks. Some of my drinks tasted like I was drinking nickels and quarters. Looks nifty as a decoration but stick with the glassware, its cheaper and doesn't taint your drinks."
4,Durable and Insulated,"These mugs are quality made, although a bit pricey. The double-wall construction provides good insulating properties to keep one's beer cold longer. I like the look and feel of the mugs and, being made of stainless steel,they should last forever. Thumbs up to the inventor and the manufacturer."
2,A book of lists,"I agree with the first posting. This is just page after page of stats. Genesis played here, Genesis played there, here are the dates etc. And then all the solo projects. Steve Hacket played here, Steve Hacket played there and here are the dates. And now we move on to Phil Collins, and ""Mike and the Mechanics"" dates and locations, dates and locations, dates and locations, and so on and so on. And then all the TV appearences for the band and solo appearences etc. Perhaps it's ""new"" in that no author ever provided these comprehensive lists before but it's really boring stuff!!! I AM A HUGE GENESIS FAN but listing every venue played on a given tour is not very interesting to me. I love their music far too much to be obsessed with their stats. As far as Armando Gallo's book is concerned all I can say is stopping it at 1980 is a good thing not a bad thing. Long live the Guaranteed Eternal Sanctuary Man!!!!!"
2,"Not Quite a ""A Genesis Chronicle""","Though it calls itself ""A Genesis Chronicle"" it is really more of a Genesis collectors resource guide and statistical abstract than a chronicle of the band. I recommend you try and obtain a copy of Armando Gallo's ""I know What I like"" if your looking for a ""A Genesis Chronicle"". unfortunatly It contains only a few photos the best of which is on the cover. The interviews are not what I'd hoped as they are really just quotes within the text rather than actual recorded interviews. If your a collector and/or trader of Genesis memorabelia than this is a good 'tool' to have handy. If, however, you're seeking real insight into the remarkable compositions, musicianship, and artistic expression of Genesis you are likely to go away empty handed from this book."
1,Nonsense,"According to this view of the world, while Moses and Jesus told their followers not to kill, Mohammed had the right to kill ""because he is perfect."" (p. 54)Presumably, the followers of Mohammed may also kill because their way, and specifically the Sufi way, encompasses all religions and is the one true way. This of course is a fallacy, since the Sufi way does not teach ""do not kill.""The book also teaches that Jesus did not die on the cross; Judas died in his place. Evil was crucified, not Jesus Christ (p. 86)The Islamic apocalyptic vision is also presented here. Believers will live, and all others will die.I am not a Christian. Regardless.If this is Sufi teaching, it does not encompass my faith, and I imagine that any thinking Christian would agree, though for different reasons.I see no solutions to the world's problems here."
1,Get Real,"""Mystical Secrets of the Last Days"" is misguidance. Not only is it made up, but it has no backing what soever. Take heed.More made up feelings, not fact. Don't waste your time. Deal with the real. In this case, if you are interested there is a great book, purely Quran and Hadith, (even tells you the authenticity of each given hadith!) called, ""Book of the End - Great Trials & Tribulations"" isbn: 9960971503. You will be thankful for every page.Peace"
5,"Best Rock N"" Roll records of the year!!","this cd is AWESOME, from start to end. every track is great,acetelene is my favorite track.Tom Petty/Drive by Trucker/stones ish!!!BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Can I give this item no stars? AWFUL,"This item is a despicable piece of trash. It is cut like wearing a trash bag, seriously, VERY misleading picture on the package. Not sexy in the least. And on top of that, the wings flop over and stay in the holder for 5 seconds, if you can even manage that. The choker was missing in my package, but the arm sleeves were itchy and awful, so I'd imagine the choker would feel the same.Overall, I've never been so disappointed with an item. Oh, and as for the fit, besides laying like a garbage bag, the small is enormous. I'm an average, size 2-4, the ""small"" was more like an 8. Terrible item that wasn't even salvageable through some creative tailoring. I recommend avoiding this item. It's a cheap piece of junk."
2,commentary interferes,"i dont mind commentary at the end of a section, but putting it between every line or 2 makes it more intrusive."
4,Dhammapada: The Sayings of Buddha,"This book was great!!! Not only did it have the sayings of Buddha, which were insightful in and of themselves, but the editor also provided witty, helpful comments between many of the aphorisms. I found it extremely helpful to my study of Buddhist culture and the religion itself."
5,"GREAT ALBUM, GREAT PRICE!!!","I bought this album in a store in Miami. I was first attracted by its low price(not as low as at Amazon but anyway...), I was totally STUNED by the quality of the songs and the artists in this album. I've always thought that great albums with great prices like this one belong only to the dream world..."
2,Meh....,"We selected this book to read for our book club. It was ok. The writing wasn't stellar - some sections read like a high school student's report. The most interesting part of the book was just getting some more detail about some of the women - but some of the profiles just jumped around so much, it was hard to get a good sense of the woman featured. The book has inspired me to go back to some of the source material."
1,Do not live up to the hype....,"Installed these pads on brand new Brembo rotors. Since then my wheels are filthy with barke dust, with reduced stopping power. I've bled the brakes to eliminate any air in the system, even though there was no way for air to enter the system during pad installation. They claim they are dust free with 70% increase in stopping power. Not on my 2000 4Runner! Going to replace them with genuine Brembo pads."
4,Good Field guide,"I've been a paramedic for 17 years and this is one of the best EMS Field Guides that I've carried. Tried a few others, but always gone back to this one. Like AE, wouldn't leave home without it."
4,okay,"I have carried this handy little reference around at work for some years, but rarely have the need to consult it. Nevertheless, I always like to keep it handy, as I see it has several important items of information, and has been highly recommended in some of my advanced cardiac life support training courses. My practice pattern has shifted to less urgent care, however."
5,EMS Field Guide: ACLS Version,I love how handy this guide is. And it was made small to fit in a pocket for easy access.
5,Excellent,"Not a paramedic yet but from what I have used of it, it seems to contain the right amount of helpful data and organized well."
5,Passionate playing and great music,"Janacek's quartets are unique musical and psychological experiences, and the Prazak Quartet manages to capture the excitement and tension of each one. They have a lovely, dark sound appropriate to Janacek as well. The violin sonata is an interesting bonus. While not as compelling as either string quartet, it is rather powerful, and expertly played here."
2,Felon Belt Buckle,This is a wicked belt buckle BUT as soon as I got it the center piece popped out because it was not properly adhered to the metal buckle. Crazy glue will fix it I'm sure but when you pay $35 for a belt buckle you expect it to be all in one piece.
1,Because I could not give it negative numbers!,"Humm lets see the 12,000 plus soviet soldiers in Nicaragua, the murderous Dictator Daniel Ortega, the death squads hell bent on destroying any attempted opposition, the near genocide of the Miskito Indian Tribe in Nicaragua, the export of revolution to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Costa Rica, along with the logistical support to send drugs to the US thru Mexico all seem to be forgotten by Miss. Sklar.Typical Liberal, writing about a world they really know nothing about... Rather sad really...."
3,Where are the adverbs?,This was a good story and I would have rated it higher had I not been constantly been brought up short by the author's use of adjectives in place of adverbs. Very distressing to find an author of this caliber so remiss in using proper grammar.
2,Unimaginative and Lacking Detail,"Jane Guy starts out as a pathetic character that you don't really care about and ends up a slightly different pathetic character that you still don't care about. The story was so beige. There was not enough detail about the surroundings and happenings. None of the characters ever develop much and I felt I only knew them on the surface. I never got to see why they were the way they were. I actually had a love/hate relationship with the author's use of ""slow"" instead of ""slowly"" to emphasis just how agonizingly slow things are on most islands and island nations. Each time I saw the improper use, it made me pause and helped me get the feel of just how frustrating a simple thing like slowing things down can be. This could have been a really good story if it were developed much further."
2,Promising premise becomes heavy-handed,"""She looked to Krakow slow?"" What is this, with all the maddening adjectives strewn into sentences where adverbs should be? It doesn't sound poetic, just clunky as all get out and distracting to anyone who cares about clean, unaffected writing. The school and the island could have been so much more sharply drawn, and Jane Guy remains a pitiful victim from start to end. Is the reader supposed to feel sorry for her, given the unsubtly awful parents? It's hard not to feel repugnance instead.No complexity of character anywhere, a plot that plods toward a grim conclusion and always those missing ""ly""s to render the book semi-literate: this was a disappointment."
1,Don't bother,"This old ""classic"" is totally disappointing. I guess cooking in the sixties (when my edition was published), was no better in Maine than it was in the rest of the country. Standish may have been a guru in her day, but her idea of a great lobster salad is simply lobster mixed with mayonnaise, and her other salads were right out of a 1960 church supper in the midwest... which wasn't good. I mean, mashed bananas in strawberry jello was representative of Maine's finest cooks?? C'mon!"
5,Finest Kind.,"This book was always in the kitchen at home, and one of the first things I learned to cook was the Doughnut Muffins, which we often had on Sunday mornings with the papers.Only place I know that has a real recipe for Red Flannel Hash, too!Brings back lovely memories. Soul Food for a Maine girl"
4,Good craftsmanship but it doesn't measure out,This headboard is beautiful and was easy to assemble but it is made to fit in with the entire bed frame that you can buy in another package. What I mean is the head board is too long to attach to my current bed frame. We have it propped up behind the night stands on each side right now until we can figure out something better. My husband might end up cutting it down so we can mount it to the bed.final word- It's a great head board but may need a little grunt work.
4,Alan Moore aka History Professor,"Alan Moore might be famous for his Watchman series, but he outdoes himself with From Hell, his personal view on the Jack the Ripper murders. A dense read that is not for the squemish, From Hell depicts a London that is distinct but with suprisingly modern traits such as bumbling policeman, the power of the press and the public in the grip of terror. Alan Moore acts as history professor as well by offering an architectural overview of London filled with insightful analysis and insight that shows how much research he has put in this. He also gives the readers little bites of English history in the form of narration, quotes and footnotes that could inspire the reader to investigate some things himself. I only gave this four stars because although it is an interesting read, the dialogue and story do drag on at times. If you have some free time and are an Alan Moore fan, definitely pick this up, but be aware that this is definitely NC-17 material."
3,Great story done a bad turn...,"The story is excellent as usual from Moore, but also as usual, the art SUCKS. Not just the art, but the lettering also. Makes reading this a CHORE. It's V for Vendetta all over again. Even the Watchmen has below average art and color, but none compare to From Hell. Moore's great storytelling deserves better...."
2,From Hell,"This book was a struggle for me. The lettering is awkward and makes it hard to read. The story is painful and moves very slowly. I kept losing interest and having to restart. Finally, I gave it to the library."
2,Not a Hardcover,"I too was disappointed. Not a hardcover. And the cover is the front of the movie poster, not the cover illustrated by the book's artist. Book is still a classic, but this paritcular package is not good."
3,"Geat story, painful art and lettering","Let me start by saying this is a great story.It combines police work, intrigue, politics, and mysticism in one package.But you have to WANT to read this novel because the poor lettering and the poor artwork make it very difficult to read.Some may consider it to be part of the ""art"" of the graphic novel, but I really think they could do better.If it was not for the poor artwork and the poor lettering, I would have given it 4 or 5 stars.For parents:This is NOT a graphic novel for teenagers or younger.It has graphic and explicit sex, violence, and defamation of the female figure."
5,old school,"A very involved story about the first true serial killer, whether you believe he was commissioned by the royal family or acted alone is open to interpretation. But very cool overall and written by the great allan moore."
3,disappointing...,"i really looked forward to this, as i love alan moore and i figured the age and setting would be a nice backdrop. but it really didn't work out well, there's a dramatic lack of impact. maybe it's because you know who gets killed and when, and from the outset you are told who is doing the killing. the whole jabulon nonsense was pretty silly. the dialogue is good throughout as a positive. moore is a talented writer but this one is a big disappointment for me on the whole."
3,Look Inside First! Its a comic book,"I watched the movie From Hell and thought this would be a great book to read. When I opened it for the first time, I was in shock, it is written like a comic book. This I was not prepared for. I didn't even think to use ""look inside"" first."
2,Boring as hell!!!,"Great story, but overwhelming dialogue, boring ass narrating, and why in the hell would an old man kill whores?!"
1,It's simply nowhere near the truth....,"Unfortunately, Moore did a great damage to the Ripper case, becasue he chose to write about the less convincent theory of them all (but one with the greatest appeal..), that of the Royal COnspiracy, laucnhed in 1976 by writer Stephen Knight, in his book JACK THE RIPPER: THE FINAL SOLUTION. FOr a glimpse of the truth, read Philip Sugden's THE COMPLETE HISTORY OF JACK THE RIPPER."
2,It's a Big Comic Book!,"I did not realize when I ordered it that it was just pages of illustrations with TINY LITTLE WRITING coming out of the various character's mouths. The writing was so small, I could hardly read it, and finally just gave up. I am not a senior citizen, but an avid reader in my mid 40's!Waste of money, I will be sending it back."
5,A MASTERPIECE OF LITERATURE,"I recently saw the movie based on this book (I'm sure you've heard of it). I enjoyed it and thought I'd give the book a shot, since I've been interested for a while anyway...It IS written by Alan ""Watchmen"" Moore, after all. I haven't even finished it yet and I can already say it is about 150 times BETTER than the movie. This is a work that transcends the notion of what comics are or can be. Had I read this first, I would have thought the movie was (...). This is a work of fiction, but it was so obviously meticulously researched that you almost believe Moore's conjecture about the case of ""Jack the Ripper"" is true. He certainly makes a strong case. Anyway, I highly recommend this fantastic bit of historical fiction, and can't wait to finish it myself. This isn't the kind of read you want to rush."
5,meticulous brilliance,"I had no idea what this was going to be about when I picked it up. I didn't even read the back to find that it was about Jack The Ripper untill I was a couple chapters into it...(gulp)My slow paced readings over the next week had me fixed in a horrific exuberance. Rekindling my paranoid curiousity, I again allowed myself to question popular intentions and limitations of man. Not what I would call a joy, but then yes I would. I will never look at black ink the same way again."
5,WOW!!!,"This story is so detailed, long, and just so damn researched,(not complaining) that it was just stupid to even try to make a movie out of it. This book is great and it deinately lives up to Moore's standards.P.S.- Work your way up to this book, don't start out with it(it's too much to handle)."
1,read before you buy,"this book is innappropriate for most children. this book tells exactly what crime the father commited, but never says that it was wrong and that the father was being punished for doing wrong. it portrays prison as being one picnic after another. in my opinion this book is not suitable for a parent whom is looking for a way to explain that a parent commited a crime and is being punished for it, but that the parent loves the child and wants the child to follow the rules of the world so that the child does not follow in their footsteps."
1,poor quality,This is rated for a dog up to 100lbs so I was sure it would work for mine which is about 55 pounds. Received the product and used it twice the day I got it and when I used it the next morning it broke. Geroys did issue a refund but it took 3 emails(about 5 days) to get them to respond to me. Once they did issue the refund it came quickly.
1,just an uncomfortable girdle,This product did not force me to sit up strait. It was nothing more than an extra-uncomfortable girdle.
1,Might work for others,I have very poor posture and thought this would help me. but it just rode up the back and made things more painful.
5,Crystaline capsule of steamy urban ambiguity.,Ms. Ullman's book manages to cast some rare natural light on the inner workings of an urban dwelling woman programmer. Her images are as crisp as her Brooks Bros. pajamas...I read the book in one sitting.
2,"Some pros, but mostly cons","Ellen Ullman is obviously an adept coder and is able to describe both the great highs and great lows of being ""close to the machine"". However, as an actual author, she's a bit tedious and occasionally eye-rollingly vapid: her surprisingly generic sex scenes seem like quick masturbatory breaks, almost as if she felt the need to remind us that ""programmers have sex lives, too"". And she shows some occasional touches of her own techno-fear, especially when disparaging the nomenclature on a web-browser's interface (she pooh-poohs the usage of ""home"" on the browser, apparenly forgetting that ""home"" has also been the traditional name for users' directories on UNIX systems). Probably a good head-nodding read for legacy techies, the post-web generation will most likely sigh ""Oh, get OVER yourself"" a few times before flinging this one across the room and going back to reading WIRED."
3,Lament of an Angst-ridden Ageing Boomer Geek-ette,"""Close"" is a rambling autobiographical story about an aging boomer. The book contains a few pearls about crunching code, but is otherwise unremarkable.She's Jewish, she's bisexual, she's an ex-Bolshi, she could have been rich, she's lonely, she wants to be alone, she loves technology, she hates what its made her. Please.Sections of the book have appeared in zines and print articles, where they read better. Techies will recognize the story, but its not very interesting."
1,"Haphazard, frenetic, lost and rather dull life of programmer","An interesting idea, but the author gets lost in the unnecessary and mundane details of her life rather than focussing on the issues the book ostensibly represents. I was misled by the title and described subject and felt cheated at the end of the book when I realised I had no real sense of the direction of this book."
3,Badly flawed book has much good material,"As a programmer, I liked the passages which described the anguish and meaning which are a well kkept secret in our line of work. But this is primarily a woman's book, and I am not a woman. Descriptions of Ms. Ullman's sexual preferences and exploits are, frankly, unwanted information as far as I am concerned, and make no mistake: These are the central issues of this book. ""Close to Ellen Ullman"" might have been a better title."
3,This Side Of OK,"For a computer geek like me, it was interesting enough, but nothing that I will carry with me for more than 5 minutes."
2,"""Problems being exploited, then commended""","Ullman makes a mockery of human existence in her book ""Close to the Machine."" Ullman characterizes the human race as a dependent, weak minded, constituency of Dr. Frankensteins, who have created a ""monster they can't handle."" Through her own personal experiences with the computer, and with love, Ullman represents the ultimately ""robotic-human"" she feels we have turned into. Ullman laughs in the face of a society she sees as crumbling in the wake of computers. Ullman, by her own, admission is a part of this crumbling mass. The apathetic tendencies of the modern day, computerized, moron Ullman characterizes, are evident in the number of people who view this as a ""good book,"" not as a warning."
1,"Avoid this book, or not.","Summary of this book: Queer woman ranting on and on about programming. The book is primarily about her pointless (not contributing much to the plot) conversations between her and other programmers, using buzzwords every other word. The plot seems to have been an afterthought, and is quite dull.If you're a non-programmer type, and would like to be up do date with the buzzwords you throw around left and right at the office, then this is the book for you! Just think: tomorrow you could be saying things like ""integrating enterprise wide solutions and reengineering infrastructure to implement a third tier capability of empowering a paradigm!"""
5,Fantastic Stuff,"As others have suggested, it really is not about hacks. Actually its the computer jargon, that keeps varying time to time. There really is a very thin line between hacks and cracks. One suggestion, ""The book's title could have been ""Wireless tips/hacks for Geeks"". Bug again for Geeks, the current title should be fine(endless loop).This really is a great book, a lot of information consolidated most of the obvious technical part removed and thorow work/research done on the subject."
4,Wireless Hacks,"I have not read it fully but so far it is informative. It's out dated but still has use full info that I need for a project.Wireless Hacks: Tips & Tools for Building, Extending, and Securing Your Network"
2,Old and dated but some good ideas,"This book was initially published in 2003 and reprinted in 2005 according to the description in the front of the book. There is some good information but it is now in 2010 and more of a history lesson than a usable book on wireless networking. Most of the network ""sniffers"" and utilities are relatively old. There is a lot of Linux code from the early days before GUI's. The newest technology in the book is the the Linksys WRT54G router which came out as a ""G"" router many years ago. So, I'm sure it was good in 2003 but not a usable book for me, back to Amazon you go...."
2,Great except for the Bugs,"I bought this at OfficeMax because it was on clearance for $10. Now I realize why it was on clearance.The software is great in itself with all the features a small business would need without all the accounting features. I was looking for invoicing and customer records and the software had them both.However, the software has bugs that need to be sorted out. Sometimes, it would work but other times, the software would crash when I tried to create an invoice, and would open back up in Spanish or French version. Thus, it doesn't seem reliable to be able to make invoices at the convenience of the software.The software is great but the bugs are unacceptable. I was using Windows XP with and AMD Athlon XP computer."
2,Completely locks up my system EVERY time I use it!,"This software locks my system up everytime I use the program. I am a service based business as well and found this very difficult to muddle through to get the right columns and descriptions to show up. If you have basic needs, this may work for you."
3,Battery compartment inferior,"I enjoyed this (I am a male btw) for putting in my contact lenses, yes the 10x area is really small, but suited my purposes well for the contacts. I wouldnt know about applying makeup etc. However I found the light would not work half the time. I am a technican and could tell clearly that the springs for holding in the batteries were not tense enough, thus the battereis would lose contact. Just to be sure it wasn't the batteries themselves, I tried a differen pair, same results. The compartment for the batteries was faulty. I also think it should have a flip side that is normal magnifcation. I returned mine."
3,Great mirror poor lighting system,"I had to send my first one back due to lighting failure. Not the batteries nor the bulbs. The company was very good about sending a replacement. Didn't require that I send the old one back. After a few months use (about 1-2X per week) the lighting has again failed on the new one!!Too bad, because otherwise I like it."
2,Disappointed,"A clever idea, but not very useful if the light is not bright enough to see anything by. Sold it to a kid for a quarter in my yard sale and felt guilty.Shipped fast, though."
1,Do not buy,What is shipped is a cardboard piece of some other item. Smells bad too. Cant even return it since I have to pay for the shipping again.
5,"Carbohydrate, Fat and Calorie Guide","The ultimate in pocket sized calorie, fat and carbohydrate counters. This book provides a complete listing of several important nutrients which is useful for a variety of disease conditions and special diets. This book was written by a Registered Dietitian (the nutrition experts) and not by some one who just calls themself a ""nutritionist"" which makes the information research based and reliable. There are several helpful pages in the back of the book which help you tailor your nutrition goals to your individual needs. There is even a place where you can enter information about favorite foods that aren't listed in the book. A must have for people trying to lower cholesterol, control their diabetes or trying to follow a healthier diet."
4,Brothers' Gonna Work It Out?,"This very entertaining film closes with a song by the great Willie Hutch, Brothers' Gonna Work It Out (from the 1973 film, The Mack). It's the perfect closing tune for the film and it should be on the CD. What a shame!"
5,Outstanding soundtrack for excellent film,"When Marvin Gaye's I WISH IT WOULD RAIN plays, and Mark Wahlberg cries, you know it is the perfect combination of great music and a great director (John Singleton) with an outstanding cast. Buy the film score also."
5,Motown here we come,"Yo if your like me and you like classic R&B (Marvin Gaye, Temptations, Four Tops) then this is the perfect cd for you. It is a great compilation of classic motown artists and it is a definite by"
3,Austin's Musical Legacy,"The musicians on this CD performed in and around Austin, Texas for decades. They played together in various bands and sometimes backed up big-names like B.B. King when they came through town, or did stints as support musicians in recording studios. They each played with the others at various times - just not all together. Someone (possibly Eddie Stout, credited as producer and author of the liner notes) got the brilliant idea to get these seasoned musicians in the studio together and record a CD. The result is a country, blues, soul, and R&B mix that well reflects Austin's musical heritage. This is the only CD the group recorded together. It is still available as an import, but if you ever travel to Austin, you'll find this CD in just about every tourist and hotel gift shop."
1,A toy,I was so disappointed with this drill I went back to using my old five year old Dewalt before this one fell apart.This drill felt lightweight and ended up being lightweight. It lasted about 18 months in normal use before it stopped working completely. It may say eighteen volt heavy duty but it sure doesn't last or feel like that.At least the batteries fit my other Dewalt tools.
2,Just a curiosity,"Groucho is too constrained and 20 years past his physical comic best. Since this is just a kino it is black and white and also filmed in the constricted TV box of the '50s. It does belong in a serious G&S or Groucho collection but has little contemporary entertainment value. In fact, to this ""Savoyard"" and ""Marx(brothers)ist,"" this just a disappointment."
3,"it's good, but not in color","It's good to see Groucho, but in spite of the misleading dust cover, which shows Groucho in color, the DVD itself is entirely in black and white and the restoration is so-so. So, be warned. Also, Groucho is showing his age...a pity that this was not done 30 years earlier around the same time as Animal Crackers. As it is, it is pretty good. Done thirty years earlier, it would have been a gem."
3,Partners in Command,"Glatthaar argues that command partnerships that worked well on both professional and personal levels were the key to military success in the American Civil War. He gives narrative accounts of several partnerships, both positive and negative -- Lee and Jackson, Lincoln and McClellan, Sherman and Grant, and so on.I don't find his thesis all that convincing -- since it doesn't really account for the Union's ability to absorb a long string of failed commanders before Grant -- and am also unconvinced by the personal, psychological portrayals of individual commanders without much detailed supporting evidence from primary sources. At times, Glatthaar makes inexplicable comments like ""Most Confederates were a propertied class (Glatthaar, 226)"" that seem, if not outright incorrect, at least oversimplified.Readers who enjoy the ""great man"" approach to history may well find this book a pleasant read."
5,AAC Handbook,"Great product, delivered fast and efficiently. Would do business with this seller again in the future."
5,Chen Xue: la creme de la creme,"Among the writers in the anthology, Chen Xue is the best. Yes, I am subjective. But I believe she is now the best lesbian writer in Taiwan. Her stories are often sad, but they always empower me. Please read her story in the anothlogy first! Her name is also poetic: Xue means ""snow"" in Chinese. (Chen, a common family name in Chinese) I adore Chen Xue!"
5,Chinese Women Speak Out!,"What a great news! Chinese women speak out with so diverse voices! I expect our voices can be more widely around the globe. There should be more PRC stories collected, but I can wait."
2,biographical info not accurate,"I appreciate the efforts on the book, but I am surprised with the bio info toward the end of the book. Sure, the info is supposed to inform the readers. However, many details are wrong. I do not know where the editor collects the details, but many are wrong. The local people will know. For instance, it is obvious that the editor is confused with the several literal media in Taiwan, such as CHINATIMES, UNITAS, UNITED DAILY NEWS. These papers and/or journals are DIFFERENT, but from time to time the editor conflates them. Well, it has nothing to do with scholarship. But it shows that the editor is not a rigours person. Not careful enough."
3,A sweetbitter journal,"World-famous actress Norma Aleandro has always written for her own pleasure, and occasionally she let her things be published. Such is the case of Diario secreto, in which Alerandro strays into the world of a little girl that has a mission to fulfill on this planet. This will logically make her an alien to the people she lives with, but she'll run the risk. The reader feels an instantaneous sympathy for the main character, but soon discovers Aleandro can stand quite far from any emotional involvement and be true to the story she wants to unravel. The book is a fascinating trip into Aleandro's imaginative world."
1,Not manufactured as advertized,"This sprocket arrived and appeared to be of good quality, however upon attempted installation I found that the holes for the mounting bolts were not machined to the specifications advertized. The part was listed as fitting my specific 1970's Honda, and the bolt hole pattern was correct, however the holes were drilled to 11mm instead of the 12mm which it should have been."
4,Wiesenthal collet is must have,"If you are person who trying to understand holcuast, wether a jew or gentle. It is worst the time and money. It will be wrost a couple of night during the week. Beware very depressing and sad. 6 million souls were lost and what was it all for ? oh vey"
3,No 12x12 printing,"I bought this program because it had 12x12 design and printing capabilities. I have a new wide format printer, I would like to utilize it's features. No matter how I set it up, it won't print 12x12, makes nice 8.5x14 or 8.5 x 11. Supports answer, change my graphics card. Sorry I have more elaborate programs than this that print fine. It even has difficulty converting to PDF for printing. I had purchsed this program and the Publisher Pro to check them out, they had rebates available, well it's been months and NOTHING RECEIVED, so don't hold your breath. The program has possibilities, the service so far is not impressive."
4,Very good product,"This is pretty easy to use and I'm having fun with it. I can't compare it with any other scrapbook programs since this is the only one I've used. But from what I see, this is really all I need."
1,Disappointed!,"I bought this product and love the results on my screen. Unfortunately, it does not look so beautiful anymore when I print the pages out. The preview and printout are fuzzy as if in draft mode. All my other applications print out just fine. I contacted Nova's technical support, but the only help they offered was to send another disk, which did not solve the problem. Now they ask me to be patient, while they try to figure out my problem. I have waited a few weeks now and am very disappointed. No matter how great the software is, if there is no real technical support, its worthless."
1,Dont waste your time with this. Its an OLD program,"This edition of Scrapbook Factory is not nearly as good as Scrapbook Factory Deluxe 4. I have played with all four editions and they got it right with the fourth one.Three is close, and as far back as I am willing to go, although you cannot extract images which is one of my favorite ways to create pages.In four, you can create JPEGS as well as PDF's of your pages and the whole program itself is more intuitive. It took me all of a half hour before I had my first page done. Showing people the ropes of the software (I gave version four as a Christmas gift to a few people) took all of ten minutes before they were on their way to making beautiful pages of their own.You can get a copy of four for about 20.00 more than this version and I feel it it well worth it. Many pages I have done, people think were done with 400.00 photoshop.Dont waste your time with this. Software evolves over time and generally becomes more powerful and user friendly as it evolves."
2,Primative program,"What a disappointment considering modern day programs. This one is primative. It reminds me of apps 15 years ago. It's complicated yet limited in what it can do. I have been trying for 3 hours to add a page for a digital scrapbook and once the program labels a page as ""front"" it cannot be done. I've clicked on everything their non interactive instructions suggest. No luck. (Even the tutorial is non-interactive). Additionally, pages cannot be rearranged once completed unless one goes through the process of copy and paste. Further, each project is limited to 10 pages so to create a hundred page album one needs 10 projects. The help section is also very basic.One good feature is that the photo editor seems pretty simple to use and does a fairly decent job. Additionally, no problem running this w/ Windows 7.Have not used any other scrapbook programs, but I sure wouldn't recommend this one."
5,great program,"To those with print quality issues: IT'S YOUR PRINTER or PRINTER PREFERENCE SETTINGS. There is a lot of flexibility and creative potential with this software. It's also easy to use...my 10-yr.-old who never saw it before, jumped right in and is creating terrific pages! Can't beat it for the price."
2,Frustrating for several reasons,"I've been trying to find a good program to scrapbook with so that I can still print out pages and not just have them on the computer. This one doesn't print well at all. I've tried printing one of thier premade pages, pages I've created from scratch with and with out pics put in and everything comes out pixilized. I haven't had any text come out with clear edges and anytime you change the size of any graphic it will pixilize the edges. I do have a good printer and can print perfect pictures so long as I don't use this program. Another thing I found extremely frustrating was not being able to search for a type of graphic. If you want a heart or scissors or flowers you have to search through everything to find them. This program would be ok if you don't want to print the pages out but if you do . . . look for something else."
1,This is AWFUL,"I bought this program ready to scrapbook pictures of my children and pictures of a baby shower that I hosted. It was fun getting the pictures organized in the templates, but once I started printing everything came out .... The pictures were blotchy and ugly looking and everyone's face looked like they had some spotted disease. When I called tech support, they told me my pictures were too big. If I had known the pictures had to be 72 dpi or less, I would have never committed myself to this product. Beware, it looks like a good product, but remember looks can be deceiving."
2,Lacks flexibility and originality,"I was disappointed when I tried to play around with this product. It is going back to the store today. You cannot print out just an element of the scrapbook, other than ""stickers"" without printing out an entire layout. So, if for example you want to use one of the few borders that comes with the program, or have the time to tweak shapes into borders or mats or whatever... beware. You must print the whole page. And you can't export images either. This is basically a limited, unflexible clipart program that might be good if all you want is to design for the web using the few choices of graphics they have. Otherwise... stay away and save for a ... ""real"" scrapbook program. (I haven't tried Hallmark) Keep scrappin. With scissors and paper if this is the best there is out there."
3,awful graphics & clipart,"Program is easy enough to use, but I am very disappointed with the graphics & clipart. Since it advertizes over 10,000 graphics I figured there would be something I liked - but it is all cheap cartoonish graphics. Nothing for the sophisticated look I was hoping for. It will not let me import graphics from other programs- so I am stuck with these cheap cartoon things."
4,Race Pack is great. Support Sucks,"I've had the race pack for over a year now. I use it for all my XBOX racing games. A big improvement over a joystick for holding corners perfectly. Built well, easy to use, comfortable. My only problem is that my kids ""destroyed"" it. Now, support will not give me the information to the 15 pin connector in order to get it to work again. I liked it so much that I'm going to buy another one. I recommend this product, but if it breaks, you're screwed..."
1,Not for the PS2,"But I am not sure how it works on the XBOX. This game wheel and seat look great, and sets up nice. Seems tough, and transports well. But if you have GT4, or if you have a newer PS2, stay away from this. It is not compatible.However, The company that makes this a great customer service, and were very quick with reply email to my questions, and i would support them!"
5,Fully compatible with PS2,This works just great with our PS! Fully compatible with our PS2. Loads of fun! A must have for the race car driver in your family!
3,Hmmm.....,"Creative numbers, funny situations and wild 80's fashion can't help this little (1 hour long) 'show' from being a total flop.Bette Midler plays a Euro-styled Ed Sullivan, presenter of the crazy and Bizarre. Her Variety show includes comic Davie Cale, Shuffling Bill Irwin, the 'explosive' Kipper Kids, dancers La La La Human Steps, the weird Pat Oleszko, the Yes/No People and Comedian Paul Zaloom.This is ridiculous~! What was Bette thinking? All that hair/awful clothes and that Italian accent.Get this only if you are a Midler completist."
4,bleeping genius!,"clocking in at 44:27m, this cd can barely be called an e.p. i was introduced to the micronauts like everyone else - with their remix of the chemical brothers' block rockin' beats. this e.p. features beats upon beats, and then more beats. but it's not too repetitive or annoying, it truly knows how to move along and keep the flow dancing. and it's a nice kind of electronica too, nothing too hard or machine-like. and you can definitely have fun just simply listening to it sitting at your computer or as background music to a summer barbecue. i've already ordered their Jag single and i can't wait to get it. buy it! now."
4,"A lot like ""The Jag""","If you're reading this and have heard ""the jag"", chances are you dig various electronic artists and chances are you loved ""the jag"" as well. The trademark rumbling basslines and crazy melodies are to be be expected from the Micronauts, but the problem lies in the album's sense of redundancy. The whole thing is like a big single split into smaller sections; the ""baby wants to....."" songs are rewirings of ""baby wants to rock"", chock-full of bleeps and bloops and a scary vocal sample. Great stuff nonetheless, definitely worth buying if you even took the time to look up the Micronauts. Still, I'd get ""the jag"" first."
1,Where are the maps?,"I won't repeat the criticisms of others. What did National Geographic think they were doing when they published a coffee-table history book under the title of ""Atlas""?"
5,Bull Nose Router Bit - Nothing to Sneeze At,"Bought to route edging on 3/4"" MDF shelving, over 300 linear feet of the stuff! Tool in my Ryobi 3hp router mounted in my DIY sliding carriage panel saw, cut it's way through on single passes without a problem (well something about a LOT of dust/sneezing...) Tool didn't overheat or show any signs of wear after the job and is back in storage waiting for the next job.I highly recommend it for this kind of application."
4,A Lutheran and Psychological Take on Sanctification,"Hulme offers a Protestant theology of sanctification that, while not thorough, is still sound. His Lutheran perspective and psychological background are visible throughout, stronger in some places than others, but he is careful to never let the psychological usurp the theological. He uses a pastoral rather than systematic tack to consider sanctification practically, avoiding significantly abstract issues in favor of ones that are necessary for the individual and the church to actively engage with. It still feels like an abstract theology book to me in some ways, which to me implies that when one has finished, there is no impetus to wrestle with the material or with God in such a way that produces change in the person, which is its major weakness, but it does provide boundaries within which one may do that wrestling in a way better than most theology texts. Kind of a shame that it's little known and seems to be out of print."
1,Poor Quality,Battery failed after 2 weeks. APC constantly beeps indicating battery failure only after 2 weeks. APC can keep their batteries who ever makes them.
1,Only lasted 5 months,I purchased this March 11th 2011 and it's already dead. I've purchased this same battery model before and it's lasted for over a year each time.The APC website says:Expected Battery Life (years) 3 - 5[...]
1,Wrong Picture,"The picture shown is incorrect. The battery that came was about half the size and not labeled as shown. The Product Description described the battery as ""3200mAh Voltage Provided : 12 volt."" The one that came was 12v/3Ah. Can't return because: ""For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com."" BEWARE!!!! The correct battery with 3200mAh\12v would be the ABC RBC2 UPS Battery. Best of luck!"
1,APC not reliable,We have 5 APC ES350 units in our office and some XS 1300 units. Keep replacing the battery. We have other brands UPS in our office and never replaced any battery. APC is not a reliable name anymore.
3,APC does not make their batteries!,"That big white APC label is covering up the real battery manufacturer's logo and information. I just pulled it off of three dead (well used) APC batteries and each was made by a different company--none of which I recognize. I keep track of around 50 sealed lead-acid batteries on my job, half of which are in APC UPS products. We check our batteries regularly with a $300 capacity tester because they are critical use. I NEVER buy APC brand replacements because I don't who made them! Stick with Yuasa, Power Sonic or a recognized brand and you know what you are getting."
1,Defective Battery - Not Allowed To Return,"Typical good Amazon delivery time, but battery does not work. More accurately, it works, but the APC software indicates that the battery will only keep my PC running for less than one minute. Same PC attached to old battery always showed about 15 minutes available.Can't return because it's considered hazardous materials, etc. I think this policy could have been more prominently displayed in the item's description.In retrospect, I should have just purchased another APC UPS unit, which would have cost me just another $15."
1,Unreliable...Failed in 5 weeks - Not Returnable,"will no longer take a charge.one week after the 30 day return policy but as others have mentioned, amazon won't take it back at all as it is regarded as hazardous material.i've had on and off problems with APC products and i'm finally going to look in another direction"
5,Great workout.,"I take her class in NYC. Yes she talks a lot in the DVD, that's how she is in person as well, but the workout is awesome, I feel great afterwards. Dasha really does pay attention to you and your technique and is really invested in you having a great workout and achieving your goals. I would definitely recommend this DVD."
3,Excellent exercises to relieve menstrual cramps,"There are 3 chapters in this book that I found really useful: exercises to relieve cramps, yoga to relieve cramps, and acupressure to relieve cramps. The other chapters on attitude, food & self-care are ok, but predictable, nothing really new or exciting. The 3 chapters of exercises are something special, and are laid out in a way that's easy to use when you need them."
4,"Good, but Sounds Like a Conspiracy Theory in Places","Jeffery has updated his 1990 book and re-released it. There isn't a whole lot of new information, but it's still good stuff. He talks about prophecies and ideas that no one even touches (i.e., the Magog/Israli war and the Second Exodus), but parts of it sound like a conspiracy theory novel (the location and return of the Ark of the Covenant). Still, on the whole, not a bad read and really informative."
5,Armegeddon,This book is excellent and informative. Grant Jefferey does a tremendous amount of research and does not embelish the facts. I highly Recommend any of his work.Rev. Doreen K Gray PhD
2,"Theories of moderate interest, not much else offered.","Grant R. Jeffrey whips out a calculator and the Bible and gives the reader a dizzying amount of verse quotation and fuzzy math to show how biblical prophecy follows Jewish Holy days. His theories are certainly interesting, but the style of writing in the edition I read was stiff and headache inducing (Mr. Jeffrey seems to have matured somewhat as a writer, if the few excerpts I have read from his other books can be taken as good examples). Fans of this style of Bible prophecy investigation will no doubt find something of interest, but others might feel that a square peg is getting brutally hammered into a round hole."
3,year of christ's birth,"Grant Jeffrey's appendix documents the reasons he believes Christ's birth was in 1 BC rather than 3-4 BC as most scholars believe. I also beleive 1BC BETTER FITS WITH SCRIPTURE, especially the verse in Luke which says Jesus' ministry started when he ""was about 30 years of age"". As pointed out, this was the first passover of his ministry in 29AD. The phrase ""about 30"" cannot scripturally or logically be stretched as everyone seems to do. As Luke was an excellent historian as well as inspired by God his account should take precedence over any other historian's comment (such as Josephus)."
1,David Hamilton Collection,At time of writing the item has not arrived and its taking a long time considering I ordered it on 26 October.
4,honoring your own sexuality,"I rank this book highly, but with this caveat: It's an anthology and the quality of the essays and poems is uneven. Only a few entries (such as ""Talk Dirty to Me,"" by Sally Tisdale) are excellent. However, what makes this book worth its price are the editor's INTRODUCTIONS to each thematic section. I think I have read the book's first general introduction about 50 times over the past ten years."
4,Like My Luggage,"I was happy with the set. I think that it was a good value for the price. I bought red thinking that it would stand out at the baggage claim. Apparently, about 20 other people had the same idea. The soil from the flight shows fairly easily on the read. The luggage rolled easily and carried enough for me and my son for a week."
1,Faulty merchandise,"One of the handles were broken and luggage ripped, after my first airline trip. This is my first unsatisfactory purchase from Amazon."
4,I am satisfied with the order.,"I like the deal because it was free shipping and tax free. When it comes to quality I guess it is ok. I bought another generic brand with same material just to compare the quality on Samsonite. When I got to the airport, I noticed the bottom part on one of the Samsonite luggage was cracked. Even after the trip, the generic brand still looks new."
5,"Has survived at least 20 plane trips so far, including international","I was delighted at the price of this set. It has survived some serious vacation travel and has yet to break in any way. Usually I lose a wheel or a handle after a few trips but these have held up very well, indeed. The big one is good for checking and the smaller wheely case is ideal carry-on size. I have yet to use the other two bags, but they are the same hardy case material and I will likely use them soon for a small road trip. Great buy"
4,Great Company to order from,The bags were great and arrived very fast! This is a great company to buy from. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the carry on bag is a little smaller than I thought it would be and the bags were not as thick as i thought they would be. A great product for the money.
1,"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY, GARBAGE","I travel every week for work so I decided to invest in this set for the name and the ""durability"". The hand got stuck on suitcases. I looked stupid at the airport trying to figure out a way to get the handle to come down. Don't even think about trying to use the warranty. You have to pay money to send it to Samsung or take it to a Samsung store and they will charge you to ship it back. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY, invest in Travelpro or SwissGear."
4,Nice looking,The suitcases arrived well packaged. I will be using them on a trip next week and follow up with a review of how they hold up to airline baggage handling.
3,Samsonite 4 piece Travel set,"The quality is a good one backed by the Samsonite name, however the two large pieces were not as large as expected."
2,"Looks nice, but lousy quality for a toy to play with","We returned it because it fell apart the first night, and wouldn't hold the missiles in. If you are a collector, it would be a nice addition. For my 7 yo son, it was a big disappointment after he saved up his money to be able to PLAY with it."
4,My son loves it!,"It's the day after Christmas. My 10 yr old got this toy and he's had a blast with it. He and his brothers played with it all day. I can't tell you (yet) how it will hold up long term, but it made it through a day unfazed and all of the much used launchers are still functional. Educational value? Zip, nada, none- unless maybe for exercising a little hand/eye coordination. But it's a lot of fun and not a loud toy like his older brother's ""battle tanks."" We're happy with it and feel confidant enough about it to recommend it. I would think it best for 8-9 year olds and up."
2,"Flimsy ""droid"" (not a vehicle)","It's probably my fault for not reading the box carefully, but this is not a vehicle, it's a ""Droid"". There is no where for a character to ride. It's supposed to roll along on the two over-sized wheels, one of them rolls fine, the other catches and snags on it's own tracks. Don't presume that you can give it a shove from one side of a room and have it glide along to the other, you have to continually push it. It has 32, yes 32, individual spring loaded missile launchers, so if you're buying this for a child as I did, keep that in mind. As far as durability, I don't imagine this surviving it's first night in the toybox..it's very flimsy."
1,VERY POOR GRAPHICS,"I had great expectations about this DVD based on the excellent ""The Medici fathers of the Renaissance"" and ordered it. The text is acceptable if you are very tolerant to poor diction and grammar. Many illustrations are by far mediocre and look like reproductions of a second grade publication. This DVD was promptly discarded. Will NOT recommended it."
1,Seemed thrown together.,"I bought this because I love tourmaline and it's healing properties. Unfortunately the beads seemed to be put together in no kind of asthetically pleasing order. In the picture the colors fade and blend beautifully. I understand that the stones will not be exactly like the picture, but they could've at least blended it a lot nicer. I was half tempted to take it apart and put it back together so it looked better, but for this price I shouldn't have to. Also, the one milagro I got with it was pretty cheap looking with metal sticking out where it shouldn't be. I was very disappointed. I sent it back for a refund."
4,Amazing Women!,"Despite the fact that a lot of the book is not spent on actual biographies of these fascinating women, I would recommend it. A large part of the book is spent on what ecomonic/social conditions led these women into piracy, and whether or not they were prostitutes, lesbians, or cross-dressed as men. However, the most engrossing chapters deal with the events of their lives and give us a closer look at women who were certainly exceptional (in their courage and also sometimes ruthlessness). I especially liked that it dealt with female pirates from various time periods and nationalities - from ancient Greece right up to modern day Asia. Overall, it's an interesting tale of a frequently overlooked part of history."
3,A good place to learn of the women who sailed the sea.,"Once you get past the first few chapters of feminist dogma the book gives some good information on women sailors including Grace O'Malley, Anne Bonney and Mary Reed. The author spends a lot of time speculating on the sexual orientation of these women since most women sailors dressed as men but doesn't give any evidence for or against her speculatons."
2,A dud,"Kate is too perfect and all the circumstances are too contrived in this silly boring mystery. There was no suspense to carry the reader along, no mood was effected, no dimension to any of the characters. This book goes back to the library shelves mostly unread."
1,Cheap Imitation of the Original,"This book is un-unique. Like the X-GAmes, it's just hype and crap, and a rip-off of something better, just done much worse. The X-Games is the worst thing to ever happen to skateboarding, trying to legitimize something that was always best in it's outlaw form.And this book is a piss-poor hack-job from the regular cooking column in the '80s Thrasher Magazines, called Skarfing Material. The author of SM, Chef-Boy-Am-I-Hungry, would happily pummel this Earl twit.Does this Earl , the King of KOOK even skate?Probably not.There's no half-star or No star rating, otherwise I'da picked one of them.And Tony, old buddy, you remember Skarfing Material. Surely you told this windbag that it's been done.Call me.Still rockin in Albuquerque."
4,grandad going extreme,"well, i'd have to say I was surprised. I hear my grandkids talking about all the x-games and extreme sports, so i thought it would be cool to get into their world, seeing how I am now 78 years old. the recipes sound pretty good and even though i won't be getting on a skateboard anytime soon, I think the ettiquete and manners section of the book will lend some insight the the younger set. soo from the rock and roll Granda I say go get it. great stocking stuffer."
1,I'd like to see the latest edition before I give a review!!,"I have yet to receive a copy of this quarterly, so I can't give you an opinion! I hope my subscription hasn't gone astray. Could you check into it, please. Thanks.Rosemary Melcher"
3,For the completists,"Having obsessive collecting tendencies, this was a must have for me. It is a very interesting and humorous look at one of the greatest bands of our lifetimes, however, it is no real extension of their musical catalog.I like the album. It is fun, but being that it isn't really an album, I have rated it as such.Be warned, Army is the edited version (which is fine with me, since I have the explicit version as well)."
4,Exclusive Interviews,This presents 6 songs from the Reinhold Messner album with interviews about the songs and the album 9which was then still in the works).
1,makes absolutely no sense.,"As a well read non-indian, I can tell you this is ridiculous!! And I find it deeply offensive that you make sound that this wonderful, talented girl is fine to fall for a loser (cool) guy that uses drugs, has no future in an educated profession and that her values are so poor she would just do whatever others wanted of her. All she needed in life was find a man!!!! Terrible!!!She sounds more like a 12 year old than 17."
1,Not that Simple,"I am a Indian girl born in the West. I found this book completely uninteresting, and it does not accurately portray the Indian - Western experience at all. Many of the problems faced by the protagonist, Dimple, are indeed problems that many Indian teenagers have to face, but I think that the problems are a lot more complex than what she portrayed, but at the same time, its not completely bad. It seemed to me that all the encounters with the Indian culture were in her eyes negative, and she came across as a self centered and just plain stupid. I disliked this book greatly, and I would most certainly not recommend it to any Desi, or other teenage girl for that matter. Its not worth the paper it was printed on. STAY AWAY!"
2,boring cliched predicatable cheesy,"BAD BOOK! i started reading it, but got so annoyed by the authors cheesy and predicatable style of writing that i stopped. If you are in highschool and would like a good book to read that has cultural struggles,i suggest White Teeth by Zadie Smith!!!!"
4,*CoNfUsEd* One (me),"I liked this story because I can totally relate. My father is Desi and my Mother use to be an Isreali Jew (now she is Muslim, All Praises due to ALLAH). It's an awesome book that slightly gets confusing at times. However, the story and the conflicts make up for it.One of the most things I love about the book is when the main character explains her confusion in the thought that- ""Somehow I'm not Desi enough to the desi's and not American as the American's"" (she used Indian not desi but you get what I mean?)I am thrilled someone wrote about this subject and hope more do so.~Muslima"
3,A really good read,"""Born confused"" is an excellent novel which captures the trials and tribulations of a second generation Indian girl growing up in America. Written in a very descriptive prose, the novel describes the throes of adolescence within the repressive window of culture, religion, custom which Dimple Lala wants to get away from. The novel expresses very eloquently all the characteristics and mannersims of the parents from an Indian teenager's perspective but later on she discovers how forward they are in their thinking. The fascination for the Indian girl with Gywn is well captured as well as the confession at the end to show all are just human. This is a book for every American born second generation teenager."
4,Vivid imagery and a great story line,"I had to read this book for a popular teen literature course in college. I ended up liking it very much - very well written with a lot of imagery. A good read for any teen going through that ""struggling to find myself"" phase."
4,Good read...,"Its good read...though lot of it is not true anymore. east asian 2nd generation americans have started relating to american as well as Indian culture and are pretty comfortable and proud of it.Its a hilarious book, good for weekend lazy read."
3,A Delicious First Attempt,"This book is very much like an Impressionist painting, interesting and witty when you stand away from it and don't pay attention to details, but messy and flawed if you get too close. Dimple changes her mind from page to page, (in what may be typical teenager fashion), and character descriptions were skewed, e.g. first impressions of Karsh.The author valiantly tries to capture teen emotions and thoughts, but made the book too long and messy in the asttempt. A good editor should have been able to cut through some of the crap and make this novel sweeter and sleeker."
4,A Decent Read,"Born Confused is a not a book for the casual reader. It is five hundred pages long, so if you do not want to spend a while reading this book, hit the BACK button on your browser now.The book itself is very well written, but it sounds like the author tried too hard to be a good writer in several spots. There are whole pages of flashbacks and frilly descriptions.However, if you are over the age of thirteen and don't mind spending hours reading a book that is almost entirely adjectives. . . go right ahead. I did, and it was well worth it."
2,Half-as-Long would be Twice-as-Good,"We read this book for a teenage girl book club. Interesting characters, fascinating situations. But Born Confused is way too long. Too many self absorbed thoughts and rather uninteresting musings by the main character.If you wish to read it, pull out the tips from your last speed-reading course and skip every other paragraph. Let's hope Ms. Hidier writes again, but gets a better editor next time! She's got a lot of potential."
3,"good, but way too long","It was good, but too long. The author probably could've said what she wanted to say in 200-300 pages instead of 500 something."
4,so compeling,"My name is Athena Miller and i belive that Born Confused is one of the best books i have ever read.In the book it is about a girl who is living in America living with her indian family.She is confused on who she is in the world and were she belongs.she thinks that she is to indian to live in America but to american to live in India.She goes through the effects of peer presure and makeing choices that most people do in real life.This is a very compeling book in my opion.It is aimed at a audience of mostly girls ages 12 through 18,but any one can read this amazing book.It has real life lessons that all people should enentually in there life time learn.It reminds me of as a 7th grader i have went through.i belive that every one and anyone should pick up this book and give it a try.I was instantly hooked when i started reading it and i hope u will be to. This book is amazing and wonderful."
3,"Interesting..touching at times, overly flowery at others.","The Indian American theme is one I find particularly fascinating, since I can relate periods of my own upbringing to it. Born Confused is worth a read. The author clearly has a way with words, and illustrates the main character, Dimple's, situation very well. At the same time, this is clearly a book that will resonate more strongly with girls than with boys. The language can often get overly flowery, and I found myself skipping whole pages when the character analyses seemed to be dragging on and on. Read it if you have time, but be prepared to be dropped a little deeper into a teenage girl's mind than you were prepared for."
5,Suggested book for people with 'Indian' friends.,"As the mother of ""NRI"" children who will live here in the US, I found myself reading the book. I liked the book. The discoveries of the heroine. The respect that grows with time, the realization that her parents are actually ""people"" with feelingstranscends cultures and countries. I would suggest that all children who have friends who are Indian should attempt to read this book. They will learn more about their friends and the houses they all grow up in. Highly Recommended Reading :-)"
4,great read,Great cultural book with a character that a lot of people can relate to. Probably my favorite aspect of the book was the descriptive writing. You could really picture Dimple's life.
5,A must-read for anyone in business,"I bought this book after seeing Bob Davis being interviewed on CNBC and I read it in one sitting. While Davis's history of Lycos's growth provide unique insight into the first heady years of the Internet, the true value for most readers lies in the lessons--on building a brand, achieving profitability, and acting decisively and fast--he extracts from that experience. An instructive and entertaining read for anyone in business today."
5,The best business book I ever read,This was a lot of fun to read. I met Davis two years ago at a conference and found him to be really smart and interesting. This comes through loud and clear in the book. I highly recommend reading it.
5,A fast read and a Must read,This is a good book for anyone looking to gain a better understanding at how to manage. It offers extensive advice with a lengthy list of do's and dont's. Surely one of the best business books I have come across.
2,Egotistical drivel,Amazing! You read this book and it sounds like Bob Davis built Lycos all by himself. Forget any of the employees who helped build the site. Forget the employees who built the company's revenues.This is a book about self-stroking.I'll wait for Jerry Yang and Tim Koogle to write their book.
1,Second Rate Tripe from Fourth Rate Exec,"Davis was a hired gun who jammed, misfired, missed the mark, blew up in everyones face. Contrary to what he would have you believe, he didn't found Lycos -- he was brought in (admittedly on day two) by his pals at CMGI. The real story here is how and why did Davis blow it so bad and huge? He was ""first mover"" as much as Yahoo and he had every advantage they had, etc. -- except apparantly Yahoo's brains. (Davis's dim tough guy act isn't really an act at all -- its thye real Bob, rough and tough with muscle where gray matter should be.) So instead of being a category leader and defining early web brand and company, Lycos ends up being fourth in a race with three winners (AOL, MSN and Yahoo). Forget the laudantory blurbs -- all those folks are Davis's personal pals who thru barely legal scheming made a mint on Lycos inflated stock price. If you want management expertise, you'll get more out of ""Body by Jake."""
3,Battlin' Bob throws down the gauntlet,"And now, the man who brought you Fraction Jackson and America's third-favorite search engine tells all. We're number three! For my money, mylycos was always better than myyahoo, but every time I tried to throw down the gauntlet and dare to compare, no one cared."
4,Great Stool,This is a great stool for your money. It is easy to put together and very comfortable. The contemporary lines do not overwhelm the bar table. For the style and price you really cannot go wrong.
4,Much Better Than Expected for the Price,"Got these Barstools for our son who is Buying a Condo and needed something that cost a lot less than he could find out there retail. We took a chance and were very pleased with the black leather and stitching on the stool seat. The wood is finished nicely, looks like a dark cherry finish - no defects. Just a lot of assembly - each leg and each rung, one by one. But the stools look great and are sturdy. One of the stools was a little wobbly, and just needed a little adjusting. Overall really like them."
4,Classy but flimsy,"I bought four of them while they were on the amazon outlet. Price was great. I've seen similar items in B&M; stores going for double.Quality of the wood and leather is good only thing is that all they are a little flimsy, wobbly. I'm sure I put them together correctly but they still seem to wobble when you sit on them.I'm not craftsman, but they were easy to put together, with the right tools."
4,excellent product for your money,"This stool is very nice. I can't believe what a great deal it was. The leather is quite thick and cushiony. It was very easy to put together and it looks great.I had it delivered at my office and my co-worker just loved it.Great product for your money, especially if you get it on the Friday Sale."
5,"Lyrical, Evocative Filk Music","This is a lyrical, evocative filk (MP3) CD with a strong focus on Celtic folk themes. The instrumentals range widely, from the pounding intensity of ""The Hunt is on"" and ""March of Cambreadth"" to the tenderness of ""Wolfen One."" Alexander's voice and lyrics match this variety, spanning the spectrum from funny to thoughtful to moving. I highly recommend this CD!"
3,Review from lean manufacturing junction,"This is a good book for helping people understand the basic concepts of TPS (Lean manufacturing). It doesn't go into detail about how to implement, but it is an easy to read, simple to follow book about the TPS fundamentals."
1,An absolute farce of a review on Toyota,This book failed to capture the essence behind the workings of Toyota. Whether it was through poor research or a simple lack of understanding this book should be avoided at all costs.
1,Demonstration with no learning value,"This is a demonstration of the style but not really organized or presented as something to learn from. And where the presenter starts to sing along its good for a few laughs. The material is not organized or broken down as anything to follow, the viewer just watches him play at full speed and you really cant learn that way. The long explanation of what the style is gets pretty boring after the first 20 minutes and the demos don't give you anything to work from. Save your money."
5,Sokolow is the man,"Again I can only ask what was the first reviewer thinking. I've been playing 15yrs and been using Sokolows stuff for the last year, its life changing material the man is so chilled out, it feels like a magician showing you all the secrets to various acts! I'm now using alt thumb and playing melody, it takes time but I dont play patterns and thats thanks to fred. I recommend all his material, you'll learn music theory that makes sense with tonnes of short cuts that work and are based on history. In this dvd he gets you picking in a fashion that is free and leaves you with the ability to concentrate on melody and forget about your alt thumb, that becomes second nature. Great series - great tution, and very laid back and relaxing.PS I'm an electric player switching to acoustic, to play some ole timey stuff, hence purchasing this dvd"
2,Handle breaks,I'll have to agree with the other comment. We received the Gentle Rain Telescoping Wand as a gift in April. It only lasted 2 months before the handle broke off in my hand. It wasn't even used on a daily basis. We hung it on the wall after each use. I don't recommend purching one of these unless you want to buy a case because they don't last very long.
3,Pluses and Minuses,"I've purchase many of these over the years to use for watering orchids in my greenhouses. It has a very soft spray (which is nicely adjustable on the sprayhead) and a good off-on switch, both of which are very useful. The downside is the handle almost always develops cracks over time in the area of the on-off switch. With daily use, they usually do not last more than 2 years. It's too bad the manufacturing is not higher quality, as the basic design and function is excellent."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,CUSHIONS ARE TOO SMALL TO SUPPORT BODY WIDTH OR HEIGHT. NO FRAMING TO SUPPORT BACK. CUSHIONS DO NOT HOLD BODY IMPRINT AND SEEM LIKE REGULAR FOAM. THE FOAM IN ONE CUSHION IS DISCOLORED AS THOUGH IT HAS BEEN WET AT SOME TIME. VERY LIGHTWEIGHT TO CARRY BUT NOT WORTH THE PRICE AT ALL.
1,Reviewing the Product Description,NOWHERE is there any information on the dimensions of this product!!
5,Great Moisturizer,"When I first tried this, I thought it was too thick and greasy on the face. I tried to apply it like a normal moisturizer by smoothing it all over the face. That is way too much.After reading the directions, you only want to use a small amount and sort of pat it on the face. This works wonders. This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. I have always had good skin, but it is noticeable better after using this.I will definitely be buying some more."
2,Novelty wears off quickly,The goals are flimsy and the ball's sliding surface scratches easily on hardwoods. (It doesn't scratch the floors -- but the smoothness will fade from the ball itself.)HOWEVER - We really only have one place to play -- and it is a long/narrow hallway. This would probably be better in a big playroom/greatroom. But Not that much fun in small spaces.
5,Fascinating book!,"A solid, old-fashioned medieval romance! Loved it and wish I could find more like it. I look forward to Ms. Wylie's next book. If you liked this book, I'd also suggest Diana Gabaldon and Elizabeth Chadwick."
3,just like i remember them,"i like all the demons and night of the demons movies, not the best movies in the world but cult classics for a reason............"
3,"Okay Movie, by awesomep","The first movie, ""Demons"", was much better in my opinion. The acting was a little better, and it was scarier when I first saw it. As with the first movie, what was the point of the punk rocker teens? It did not add much to the movie at all. It seemed out of place to me having that scene in the movie. The young lady who played Sally, was better at playing a demon than her human character. Her whinning was quite annoying and the acting over the top at times. The scene with the demon fighting the expecting mother was silly and could have been left out of the film. The other scene was when the expecting mother went into labor and had her baby, only to get up with her husband and walk out of the building as though she was going for a walk. The three stars are for the demons makeup and how scary they could be at times."
2,interesting concept but goofy execution,goofy zany etc I mean stuff happnes you are liek wtfand like what about x?lol
2,My Opinon: Not Brass,My order was filled with Melnor part no. 505S. This unit looked to be made from pot metal with a kind of gold electoplating. The nozzle could not have the durability of the brass nozzles that I have used in the past. The Ozbo service dept. was quick to respond and offered a refund.
4,"Small as I was looking for, worked as it should.","No problems with coffee maker, I was looking for something small to fit in our camper and this one fit the bill. Worked as it should."
4,Saves me money,I now make coffeee every morning and froth some warm half and half to give my husband as he walks out the door. This Frother has saved me a lot of money since I now don't feel a need to go to the local Starbucks to get a good cup of coffee. I treat myself every morning with my coffee and it's frothy milk top.
3,Love my Lattes,"Froths my skim milk just the way I like it. However, I heat my milk in the microwave first rather than in the frother. It can be hot to the touch so be careful and pouring the froth out can be a little messy. But after a few tries, I have mastered this frother."
5,Simple and Perfect,"Foams the milk perfectly and quickly, so much better than the battery-operated Aerolatte I bought that didn't work at all. I usually foam the milk first, then put it on the stove for a minute. I put both pieces (the bottom carafe and the top lid with the attached plunger) into the dishwasher and have not had issues with rusting."
4,Great frother,Im pleased with my frother. Used correctly you will not get any more of a mess then the small amount that comes out the top at the plunger. It will hold enough milk for multiple cups and still froth. My only complant is that the screen has a plastic housing. I dont heat my milk up hot enough to effect it. But I was hoping for something all stainless. That is why I did not give this product a 5 star rating. Other then that it has been a great item.
2,Not the same,I purchased this frother because it is the exact same model as one a friend has. That one works so well! But they have changed something in the manufacturing and the lid doesn't sit securely any longer. It no longer works! Don't order this product.
1,Not worth using,"Once I started using the frother, I placed the milk into the container and pumped the handle. Milk went everywhere. It went out the outside of the lid and through the handle. There was milk everywhere else than in the container. You had to pump it extremely hard and multiple times (about 3 to 4 minutes) before the milk would even change. Even after this amount of time the milk still did not become thick. I'm not one to complain, but I felt this product was a big waste of my time."
1,The handle just fell off.,"While the frother worked well, the handle on the side of the pot just fell off in the sink while I was hand washing it. I only used it 2 times. Poor quality adhesive. Not even spot welded. Wouldn't recommend."
1,Worked twice,"I loved it at first. Then after working great two times, it stopped working. Used it exactly the same way, and it wouldn't froth. Now i can't return it."
4,Wonderful!,"The frother works wonders! Super creamy foam and it's so easy to use. The only complaint I have is that it scalds on the bottom before the milk gets warm. I have started to microwave the milk first and than froth to avoid burning it on the bottom. But the foam is perfect and creamy and so, so good!Definaltey beats the $180 espresso machine we bought and never used because it took up too much space on the counter, too much time to clean and we only used the frother part of it.This is a great buy!Would recommend and may buy additional as gifts for family and friends!"
5,"Works great, beefy construction",This thing does exactly what it's supposed to do and does it well. 'Works best if you pre-heat the frother with really hot tap water before pouring in the steaming hot milk. It's also well constructed and expect to get many years service out of it. It looks classy too.
2,Quick and not so good,I returned it. It did not make a heavy foamy froth. It is just a fine screen set up like a french press. If you like a thick heavy foam you need to look elsewhere.
5,Great Product,"Bought this with some reservations because I don't use a lot of beauty products. I have hair that's about 6 inches past my shoulders and it's very wavy underneath and limp/wavy on top. I tried this and it's so easy it's crazy. I used it and it looks great for about 2 days without touch-ups. I just run a brush through it in the morning. I sleep on a silky pillowcase to help keep it from kinking. I definitely use a thermal/heat protector on my hair before using, but I haven't settled on a favorite of that. I'll definitely use this a lot!"
4,DON'T USE IT ON WET HAIR,"It's a good flat iron for the money, but remember never use a flat iron on wet or damp hair even if it says you can use it on wet hair. Using a flat iron on wet or damp hair causes tons of damage even with a heat protectant,so just remember to use it on dry hair after you've used a heat protectant and you should have no trouble. I've had this flat iron for over a year now and it still works fine, if you take good care fo your flat iron the ceramic plating won't chip off! The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that all though it's a good flat iron it takes a bit longer to heat up properly."
3,Seems to work OK,"Bought this for my daughter for her birthday as she has been asking for one for awhile. I purchased this one out of the rest since it specifically refered to being able to use wet or dry. It also was mid priced and by a well known manufacturer. Both my daughter and wife now use it and I haven't heard any complaints from either so assume it is working as advertised. I rated it 3 stars just because I haven't heard a ""wow"" from either my wife or daughter but when I ask about it get the comment that it works just fine. Probably, there are better ones on the market, maybe even some with a ""wow"" factor, but this one seems middle of the road, functioning as advertised."
3,Its okay,"This straightening iron really does make your hair go from wet to dry , but my hair feels crispy now. It also pulls your hair while your straightening."
2,OK Product,This straightner works good when hair is dry! I thought that it would work wet and i wouldn't have to dry it but i was definitly wrong! You must dry you hair first then straighten. My hair is wavy and by the end of the day if it was humid or raining it would return wavy not straight! But it worked on winter days really well!
5,Amazing Purchase,I love this and my hair is shiny without having to use any product. I have used it for 3 weeks so far and it makes my mornings so easier.
4,"works amazingly, buuut...","so i got this last Christmas as a gift. i was so excited, and i used it, and it is very easy to handle and to control, and it does as it advertises. the only down is that when straightening, the steam from the vents would occasionally burn my scalp. i like to get as close as possible to my roots when straightening, but the prevented me from actually getting as close as id like to. but this is amazing and overall, i would recommend it."
2,17 Year Old User.,"This product was awful. I was so excited to buy it because I have wavy hair from a perm a year ago, and it takes 2 hours to blowdry and straighten. This product didn't do a thing. It may have straightened my hair (after running it through about 10 times) but it didn't dry it in the least bit, and it made my hair frizzier than it's ever been. Do NOT buy this product!"
3,"Adequate, but there is better out there......","Pros- the adjustabiilty is great! The straighten while wet feature works, but be careful- you can burn yourself with the steam. Also, I only use it on bangs- it can damage the ends of hair. Lighweight and easy to travel with.Cons- even on the very hottest, does not do a superior job on my wavy hair. Not as good as my previous straighter, which broke. Also, the hot plates do not come all the way to the edge, so it will not add a flip or turn very well.The Remington T Studio is far superior for only a few dollars more."
4,"Hot, Hot HEAT","I've had this straightener for about 4 months now, and I bought it because of a recommendation. I straightens my coarse, curly, dyed white girl hair relatively well, although I do need to run the straightener over the same sections of hair to get it entirely straight. It also works well on my boyfriend's natural coarse, wavy, Hispanic hair. I have a problem straightening my bangs with it...but that just might be because my hair is ridiculous curly or that my bangs are unruly...but sometimes I wish it could handle it. Very smart straightener...it beeps periodically when it's still plugged in (even if it's turned off which it does automatically. Not perfect, because it still makes me wonder if there's something better out there....but it does the job and makes the straight stay. Very, very hot...sometimes my hair will get so hot that it will burn my fingers when it's placed on them after being in the iron....oh my god this is so long."
5,better than a solia,Just got this on the advice of my 17 year old niece. Kids no everything these days :) I just tried this straightener and it blows my expensive Solia brand away. The Solia just does not grip my hair tight enough to straighten out those kinky waves. Not a problem with this Remington model. I would not recommend using any hot iron on wet hair and will not be trying it anytime soon. The price is fantastic to for the job it does. I am just amazed and highly recommend this straightener to anyone.
4,a nice surprise,"I read the reviews and was quite skeptical since I've tried almost everything to straighten my coarse, thick, curly hair. I get my hair chemically relaxed about every 9 months. But the results keep my hair still curly, just not as bad. I've used ionic hair dryers, flat irons, curling irons, etc. It usually is an hour and a half process and me sweating half of my body weight in the bathroom! But this product eliminated the hair dryer...no sweating! It straightened quite nice! I used a comb in conjunction. That's the only thing I wish it had built in. My hair section was completely dry in the one passage. The entire process only took me about a half hour! Just make sure you condition well and use a good hairspray to ensure lasting results. I used my curling iron to secure and smoothe my ends. I'm impresssed."
5,One hot iron!,"I was sceptical...read all the reviews on numerous sites and found about 1/10 hated it, everyone else loved it. I bought mine at Target for $24.99. I used it for the 1st time this morning and I'm hooked! My hair isn't limp like it gets when I blowdry then straighten, it has some bounce but is STRAIGHT. It took a while, and I did burn myself when my hand was too close to the steam vents, but I'll get used to the whole hand-placement thing and it'll get faster w/practice. It usually takes me 30 minutes to blowdry and another 10-15 w/a flat iron. This took me 30 minutes max, and that's with 3 kids interrupting me. Pretty good! AND, NO SWEATING as with the blowdrier. I also feel like this is better for my hair since I'm not pulling and streching it w/a coarse brush while drying. I'm very pleased."
5,Best gift a girl(friend) can get,My girlfriend borrowed one of these from her friend and commented on how well her hair was straightened and how little damage occurred (compared to her own straightener). I ended up buying one for her (from Amazon) and she loved and still uses it today.Do your hair right and get one of these. You won't regret it.
3,Okay for the price,"Was very excited about the product when I read the review but hasnt worked that well yet..Hair breakage is a problem and hair tends to get overheated.I use it at less than 400F but the steam thing still doesnt work.As compared to the others from vical sasson and conair,it lacks a smooth finish."
1,Stopped working after 3 months of use!!!,This hair straightener is not worth getting. It stopped working after 3 months of use. I have never had a hair straightener do this!!
4,Straight hair in little time,"My hair luckily is wavy, not too difficult to be straighten, but with this product my life get much easier, because i can straighten my hair in 15, 20 minutes. And i am saying about really professional result. BUT there is a problem...the straigtening iron is so hot some times that you have to be careful not to ""cook"" your hand...!!! Some gloves will be a clever idea!!!! :)))"
4,"Great Product, Better Price!",We received this promptly and it has been working great every morning since. It was a gift for my mother and she says it is one of the best straighteners she has owned. I recently purchased a flat iron for my girlfriend for over double the cost but this works the same if not better according to my girlfriend.
1,OKAY if your hair is already STRAIGHT,i have wavey hair and in the back it is curly so for christmas i got this straightener it never broke or anything but it didnt straighten my hair very well unless i went over it like 10 times and my hair is just past my shoulders it dosent relly straighten when your hair is wet it also burns your fingers when you use it and again my hair just past my shoulders but it takes me 1 hour and 45 to straighten but it isnt all the way straight so i wouldnt get it and well my friend has the CONAIR straightener on this website and it works great for her and her hair is curly so i recomened that one
1,This thing didn't work,"I wanted a cheap straightener after the one I had been using (A Con-Air, I think) started smoking. I found it at Wal-Mart, thought the price was good, and went for it.It didn't work. I have thick, long, wavy hair, and no matter how many times I went over the same spot, my hair would not get completely straight. Nor could I imagine this thing actually drying my hair. I used it one time and haven't since.Maybe I just have stubborn hair or something, I noticed this thing has a lot of positive reviews, so I don't know."
2,"If It Sounds Too Good To Be True, It Probably Is.....","Although I was skeptical about this product I decided to try it given the high ratings from other users. I was very disappointed. I have fine, very thick curly hair. It didn't really straighten my hair and it made it look bigger and took forever to get it half-way dry. It made a nasty sizzling sound when I used it, and sounded like it was doing more damage than anything. I am not sure if other users exaggerated when they said they had ""thick curly hair"" and it worked for them, but it sure didn't for me. Some users said they used it when their hair was already dry but that doesn't make any sense, might as well buy a regular straightener that actually works! I was smart and bought it from Bed Bath and Beyond so I could return it if I needed to and I am very glad I did!"
2,misleading reviews...,I really dont understand how this straightener got so many high reviews at all. I have shoulder length hair thats frizzy if left to air dry...but I can usually straighten my hair just fine with other straighters in about 20 minutes. This straightener takes over 30 min and it does Not work well on dry hair. It doesn't leave hair smooth and my hair would be really poofy if i didnt go over it like 4 times. It literally made me sweat when I used it because of all the times i had to go over my hair! That and all the steam. I used it on the high setting too and although it would get my hair mostly dry ...it would just be dry and frizzy. The very back would still stay damp. Its fine for the money and if your hair is naturally straight but I returned this straightener for the remington t studio tourmaline flat iron which works well.
4,So far so good,I have thick long hair and this does straighten it quite well....sometimes it does make my hair smell burnt thou...I dont really see the big deal though with the wet 2 straight but overall product works well especially for the price
2,Horrible.,"I got this in the November of 2008. I used it for maybe a month and it broke. I can no longer control anything on it. Not only that, but, it leaves my hair smelling revolting. It didn't ever do a 'ta-da' job straightening my hair. My hair would stay straight for part of the day; maybe 3 hours and it was back to it's state pre-straightening. I have fairly straight hair. Although, my layers give it ugly waves. I've given up using this and havent straightened my hair. And am looking for a new and BETTER straightener. I would not recommend buying this.No good.No buy."
4,Wow,"Remington Wet 2 Straight has done wonders with my hair. I have a naturally thick wavy hair that tends to frizz and usually no amount of ironing can keep it calm. This hair iron somehow manages to keep it straight all day long, it can be damp and muggy out and my hair still remains straight and no nonsense. The pessimist in me is still waiting for all my hair to fall out one day because the steaming effect on damp-to-wet hair tends to frighten me, but I've been using this for the past 3 months an no harm has come as of yet.Yes, it works on wet-out-of-the-shower hair. No, I wouldn't recommend it (mainly because with all the steam it's hard to avoid burning yourself). I recommend using this on damp hair, I usually let it air dry for about an hour or, if I can wait, I'll towel dry it and let it air for 10-15 minutes."
5,Saves so much time!!!,This straightener is amazing! It saves time bacause you don't have to blow dry and then style it. You do it all at once! I always make sure I use a really good conditioner so my hair doesn't get too damaged but I do that with every straightener/curling iron I have. The wet2straight irons are by far my favorite and they're not outrageously expensive like some irons.
2,Not that good,"My daughter-in-law wanted a wet to straight straightener so I purchased two of these, thinking I would love to skip the blow drying process. My daughter-in-law loves this product, but it does nothing for my hair. My hair is thick and semi-curly and it took FOREVER to get my hair from damp to straight with this thing. I even tried drying my hair first but it just didn't do a good job straightening my hair plus it weighs a ton."
3,Too wide for you maybe?,"I gave my mother (a professional hair stylist) this for christmas due to the high ratings. I'm still sure its a great product, but I marked it 3 stars because she said that it was ""too wide"" on top. Just make sure you take this into consideration when buying. She then proceeded to take it and return it to walmart and got 6 dollars more store credit than what i paid for it, so win-win i think."
3,"Great straightener, very short life","This straightener was great for about a year. Then one day, I plugged it in and one of the plates stopped working."
5,Love it.,"I highly doubt I will be buying a different one next time I need one. This one is so nice and heats up so fast. Very convenient, and I love that its wider than most. If this one doesnt please you than your pretty dang picky!"
3,ok for dry - do not use wet!,I have shoulder length thick hair. I bought this to use on wet hair so I could skip blow drying. I let my hair partially air dry before use. It boiled the top layer of my hair and left if looking frizzy! I will never use it on wet hair again. I did use it on my hair when fully dry and liked the results. It does snag on my dry hair a little when using. I will keep this as a back up if my Sedu breaks. Overall for the price it is a good dry straightener but I don't recommend using this on your wet hair.
2,It's just not worth it...,"I've been using it for awhile (a year maybe), so that shows you that it DOES work, but:-My hair is totally damaged!! Hair gets caught and I now have extremely damaged hair.-I have never been able to use it wet - plus it seems dangerous...maybe it's just my hair, since it is really thick and full, but I would blow dry my hair almost to done & try to use this and I still had drops coming out burning me. AWK!-It takes me several goes over each strand of hair to get it straight and when your hair is long, it seems to take FOREVER to do!-AND lastly...it is bulging up in at the end, so I am cramping my hand daily trying to keep the plates together. My hand is in pain even now...not a good thing!Just not worth all of the issues, honestly."
4,Stylist recommended,"I am new to using an iron to straighten my hair so I didnt want to spend $200 on an iron, but I also didnt want to ruin my hair. I haven't used the iron very many times yet, but so far, it has done alright. It was fine to use on damp hair. I did have to turn it up higher than I thought I would have to so that it would do the job, but that's my hair type, not the iron. The iron is a good buy and I highly recommend it. I even had a stylist at a salon tell me she uses this kind so I figure I chose the right one!"
5,Great product,I bought this for my niece a few years ago and she used it so much she wore it out. We replaced it with another brand and ended up buying yet another brand before she decided that we needed to go back to the Remington Wet 2 Straight. She's been happy since!
1,2nd one that doesnt work!!!,this is the second one i ordered and have to return...i have had 3 in the past with no problems. It gets hot and turns off.
1,Died.,"I've only owned this flat iron for a few months, and used it maybe two or three times and I plugged it in this morning to find that it has completely died. Maybe its a fluke, but it's very disappointing."
3,Not good on electric,"Was looking for a short cut to save time in the morning and it worked beautifully at straightening my hair--until it blew my electrical circuit! I had thought that my lights seems a bit dimmer than normal, and sure anough, out they went! The only other thing on at the time was the light in the room I was using the Wet 2 Straight in, so it really shouldn't have blown a circuit. So unfortunately I am back to drying then straightening!"
2,Not worth the money at all,"I bought this product because I thought it would save me time by not having to blow dry my hair first. The product claims it will dry and straighten your hair at the same time, but it really did neither of these for my hair, which is thin and generally easy to straighten. I bought a Vidal Sassoon straightener that works perfectly for about $10 less than this one and it works so much better. Don't waste your money on this product, it's not worth it."
3,Disappointed,"I have thick and wavy hair that takes a long time to straighten. I bought this product with the hope that it would save me time without having to blow dry my hair before ironing it out. NOT TRUE!!For one, it takes LONGER to iron my hair when its wet. Secondly, it does not stay straight when it dries. Thirdly, it becomes even more wavy after it dries up.I NEVER use the wet hair setting anymore. I treat it like a regular iron. It's OK that way.Another minor thing..it has a button that you press to change the settings. If I need to go from a 15 (standard setting when it turns on) to a 30 (highest heat), I have to press the button 15 times. Cumbersome!!"
4,It really works,Bought this for my wife. She wanted a 4 inch version but I could only find a 2 inch. She actually was surprised as it really works. She has wavy hair and not too curly. I guess for this type of hair is works very well. She said she gets the same look in half the time compared to her old 4 inch flat iron. Product is a solid build and looks stylish too.She was quite pleased and I came out looking like a good husband :)
4,wet or dry,"a pretty amazing flat iron.i try not to use it when my hair is really wet due to the smell of burning hair,boiling water splashback, & the loud sizzle. i wait until my hair is slightly damp & put it on 300.i haven't found any split ends & my hair looks healthy after using it"
4,I love it!,"I bought this originally because I just needed a flat iron, after my mom took mine (long story). Well, it works really good! It works good with dry or wet hair. I don't use it when my hair is wet, mostly because I take showers at night. But when your hair is wet, it might scare you becuase the moisture is let out as steam, and might warm-up your neck. It's NEVER set off a fire alarm (that was one of my main concerns.) It does hurt my fingers, I'm guessing because I might grip it to hard. I have never accidently hit a button. Also, I like how you can adjust the tempature. I stay at 350, mostly because I have thick hair. Btw, I have the 2 inch plates, not 1 inch :)"
4,worth it...,"well worth the price. i have used it a couple of times and still getteing the hang of it. i have relaxed thick hair, the first time when i washed and used the hair straightner for a while the settings were too high so it wasn't coming out as i hoped, or seen when my hair dresser uses it on my hair. after lowering the temp, it got better. sure it would have been salon quality if i realised the wet/dry settings. cant't wait to wash my hair and try it again."
2,It does what it says!,"Pros- its light weight, does what it says, dries my wet (thin but dense) hair and straigtens. It is a pretty contraption and it has adjustable heat which is nice.Cons- my Hair gets caught in the frame of it and pulled out which is both painful and frustrating. And it happens so frequently and it is such a big deal that if i had the money i would go ahead and pass it to my little sister and buy a new one.I do not have said money and it doesss do what it is supposed to so for now i can continue to use it and thats why it got a 2 instead of a 1."
2,Bad Advertising,"THey say you can just straighten your wet hair with this - I would never do it on hair that is wetter than slightly damp. Your hair is still damp afterwards, and it looks like a bad straghtening job.Also, the steam is unbelievable. You have to be realy careful or you can be seriously burned - I have been several times.If your hair is very wet, it will stay hot for several minutes, and usually you need to go over the same part twice so this is not helpful at all.I would NOT recommend this to anyone. The a.dvertising makes it seem too good to be true, and it is."
5,Great Straightener,"I've never used a straightener before and when I purchased this I was suprised at how easy it was to use. I do blow dry my hair first, then straighten. It comes out so straight and shiny and healthy looking. I purchased mine for just $29. I highly recommend this product."
3,"Works fine, but not great.","I have had this flat iron for two years, and it has been fine. Here are my two cents:Pros-*Easy to use*Fast heating (1 1/2 mins. after 2 years of use)*Adjustable temp.*Could be used on damp hair (DO NOT USE IT ON WET HAIR!)*Gets up to 375*FCons-*Beeps when ready,,, a little loud*Frizzes when used on wet hair*Doesn't get my hair pin-straight, as I wanted. (See viewer images)*Not ceramic plates. Only metal with a paint covering*Rusts from the use on wet hairI only gave it three stars because of the value.***JUST DO NOT USE ON WET HAIR!***Even though the packaging says its fine, it damages hair easily, and it also makes it cackle and steam.Also, I use mine at setting 30 (highest) because my hair is so thick, and I have minimal damage."
5,I liked it..,"I honestly can't see how people are having so many problems. I have thick curly hair and it dried my hair pretty quickly as well as straightened it, with no frizzies! I think the people who were having frizz problems have to understand that if you straighten your hair everyday, it causes damage no matter what...also, maybe try a different styling product. I recommend Aussie or Garnier Fructis Smoothing Milk. And, as many have said, there is no magic product that causes your hair to dry in one, quick swoop.. I went through about 3-5 times on each section, and it didnt take much time at all (I have waist length hair). What I liked was that it didnt take the volume out of my hair, which I've had problems with straightening in the past, so my hair was pretty flat. I recommend it! A!"
4,Good Value,"This wet/dry ceramic hair straightener does a fantastic job. I would certainly encourage other people to buy it. The only draw back is it may do too good a job drying the hair, to the point it makes your hair very dry. The solution is to always moisturize your hair and use an extra leave in conditioner when using this iron."
5,Awesomeeeeeee,Love my iron. Gets the job done. Bone straight. Searched everywhere for this iron . Glad I found it on here.
4,Wonderful product,"I think this is a wonderful product for the price. I have thick naturally curly hair, so to get it straight, is very challenging. I wasn't sure about keeping my current hairstyle, so I wanted to find a decent straightener without spending over $100 for the one at the salon. As long as you pay attention to the directions for the settings, according to your hair type and whether it's damp or wet, this works wonderfully. You might still need some hair products to control the frizzies and fly aways, but almost all of us need that.I would definitely recommend."
5,best flat iron ever used,"I love this tool. I have one and so does my daughter. It heats up super fast, and the diffrent heating settings works for wet or dry hair as well as for all types of hair mine is very fine so I need less heat but my daughters is very thick so the higher settings are better. We both get so many complements on our hair since we've been using them and again because of the setting (15 levels) I do not see alot of damage being done like I have with other hot irons. I would definetly recommend this to anyone who likes having their hair straight in no time at all :)"
5,excellent,"This score was chosen for ""love"" as the color of the product along with its quality make the vendor is qualified in such manner. I recommended to my niece buy a model remington and hopefully soon will enter. thanks"
3,Second one bought in a year,"I bought the 1"" about two months ago and it crapped out after a few uses. I think it was faulty wiring since it would turn on and then as soon as I turned it over it would switch off.Up until that point it worked brilliantly."
4,Loved them!,"I was a little worried about getting these straighteners because I've been through quite a few that definitely didn't work. After trying these, I loved them! They actually really work! I must admit that I don't use the wet to straight feature because I prefer to blowdry my hair first. I use these almost everyday and they really straighten my hair. I have very little criticism, however I would prefer a longer cord between the straighteners and the outlet, but that's just my opinion. If you are trying to decide whether or not to get these, get them! They are excellent value for the money spent!"
5,its great,Out of all the straighteners I ever bought this has been the best. Its straightens my hair good it doesnt take a long time to fix my hair. It doesnt leave it frizzy it stays smooth. its great
1,not worth the money,"I have curly hair and i always use straightening irons on my dry hair. I got this one because I wanted to have something to use over wet hair as well. This dried my hair fine but did a crappy job on straightaning. It works like one of those $10 irons from drug stores.Also I never thought I will have problem holding a hair iron, but the handle of this one is very big that I had to rest every few seconds!!!I am planning to return this after I give it another shot."
5,The Best Straightener Ever!!!,"I have very thick, course, curly hair.....lets just say my hair is a beast. I have tried everything I can think of to tame my hair. I've used other hair straighteners and I do get some straightening but I would mostly just get poofy wavy hair. After much debate with myself I decided to try the Remington Wet 2 Straight flat iron. I am SO glad I did. I used it on wet hair and the flat iron fully dried my hair using 3-4 passes over each section. I was even able to get the roots dry. My hair come out soft, smooth and STRAIGHT! Not poofy straight but straight! My hair is so soft and not frizzy at all. This is the best product I have ever tried. I have received so many compliments on my hair it's amazing. The products I used in my hair are: Pantene Pro-V Curly to Straight shampoo & conditioner, Pantene Anti-Frizz Straightening Creme, and Pantene Heat Protection&Shine Spray."
1,not so good,"makes my hair too dry and it looks like it is way overworked...i would not recommend it for people who have very coarse, wirey, curly hair...especially if it's dry to begin with"
2,Pulls hair,"I bought this for my daughter for her birthday last year. She has very thick, wavy hair and she was always complaining about how 'poofy' it was. I wasn't sure what to get because I have never used one myself, but I ended up picking this one for the wet/dry feature. I thought it would be easier for her to use if she could do it while her hair was still wet. This straightener does work, however I used it on my own hair and it does pull alot.. it's not smooth at all. I know these things damage hair anyway but I don't like the feel of it. I will be looking for a different one."
2,Bought this because of the good reviews,"I have long, course, thick, curly hair, that has with stood all sorts of straitening techniques. That being said, I bought this because of the reviews I got from family members who have wavy to curly hair, and they loved it. It did little for me. I used it while my hair was wet, and it dried it a little, but nothing else, when I tried repeatedly, my hair frizzed up. I no longer mess with this."
5,Love it!,"I have very curly hair, I didn't think it possible for it be straight. This product was used on my hair and I loved how sleek and soft my hair feels when it has been used.I am new at this fussing with my hair stuff, it is taking some time getting used to it. Fortunately, my hair stays straight until I get it wet again, so I don't have to fuss with it (and increase damage to my hair) every day. I think the nicest thing about it is that I DO have options that I never have experienced before. I also find that I really do appreciate my curly hair more too since I now have a choice."
4,"Great straightener, Great price!",I bought this hair straightener for my 12 year old daughter. I purchased this one because it seemed to be a quality straightener for a reasonable price. It heats up quickly and is easy to use. She can use it if her hair is wet or dry. The only thing she doesn't like about it is when her hair is wet the straightener shoots out steam that burns her head if she is not holding the straightener far enough away.
3,Makes hair to frizzy De-Natures your hair!,It's a good straightener but it will not leave your hair as straight as it did in the video. Even if you put the most expensive spray for heat and anti-frizz it will cause frizz. I have tried a straightener from CVS and its cheaper and a lot better than this one it is less frizz and works better with lower temperatures than the Remington. The Remington just De-Natures your hair and causes your hair to even loose color. The only thing I liked is the seller they sent it fast. Thank you
2,so so,this product didn't work on my daughters hair so i'm out of the money i spent plus i had to go buy a different one
3,it gets hot,This works pretty well. My only complaint is that the top of the straightner gets VERY HOT and I have accidentally burned my hands more than one time.
2,Not the best,"I bought this iron some time ago and it's not the best for thick wavy hair. Actually, I am looking for another one because one of the plates fell off. I wouldn't recommend it very much unless you don't use it much."
1,Item broke while opening hard plastic packaging,"This straightener came packaged in the thickest, most difficult to open clamshell packaging I have ever encountered. It took me 15 minutes to get it opened, slicing my hand open in the process, and when I removed the straightener the cheap plastic on the bottom was cracked, and the item useless. I was careful opening it, but I may have done it inadvertently. It was hard to tell with all the blood. Never again."
4,Wet/Dry Hair Straightener,Given as a gift and she really liked it. Easy to use but would recommend using a conditioner such as TreSemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Protective Spray.
3,"Good, but possibly damages hair :/","I got this yesterday, and while at first I was overjoyed, I realized that it doesn't seem to protect the hair in any way. While it irons my hair even better than my old straightener, especially when wet, both my mom and a friend agree that it seems to be damaging my hair, and it gets so burned you can smell it. Definitely use a heat protectant."
5,Made me look good :),I got this item as a Christmas gift for my daughter a year and a half ago; she loved it then and still does. She uses it very often. It was definitively a good choice.
3,"Better than just blow drying, but not straight","I tried both the wet and dry settings after reading many great reviews on this iron. One reviewer recommended reading the instructions to get better results. I have medium length thick hair prone to frizziness and I live in a humid climate. My hair did seem less wavy than it does when I only blow dry, but I was disappointed that my hair is not as straight as it was with my former straightner that died after 5 good years. I agree with other reviewers who say after straightening, hair has a straw-like quality, and is not shiny or healthy looking (part of the reason I straighten). Strangely, for me the iron flattens but does not straighten hair. It is still wavy, just less puffy. I am looking for another affordable straightener that will produce better results."
4,Wet 2 Straight,"I like this item. I thought it would be more like the one my mother has; but its OK. I would rate this item at 4 stars. It drys the hair, but it gets extremely HOT. So I set it at a very low temperature."
4,bought for my daughter,"Arrived in a timely manner, I guess it's well received, it's for my daughter and she likes it as far as i can tell"
3,Cheap flat iron,I usually pay more for my flat irons but my friend has this one and loves it. It does what it says and straightens wet hair but I find it makes my hair look frizzy. As a regular flat iron it doesn't straighten very well. I would rate it as just 'ok'.
4,"Straightens, but doesn't dry...","While is came very well packaged and works very well, one drawback is that it doesn't dry your hair at all. It does straighten the wet hair, and speeds up drying, but it doesn't actually DRY the hair. While I still reccomend it and think it is worth the money, you should be aware of the fact that it doesn't DRY the hair.P.S. sorry about my username, I left my younger male sibling to create this account!"
3,you get what you pay for,"My sister and I have been using this straightener almost everyday for almost 7 months now. It is a relatively good straightener. My hair is very thick and wavy, and I have to go over it a few times before it actually gets straight. Another thing that has happened with this is a constant burning smell, even when we use a low setting and make sure that the plates are clean and our hair doesn't have any styling products in it. Also, there gets to be rust-colored build up and some kind of coating is coming off in our hair. It's fine at first, but it's not built to last, which is what you get for $[...]."
1,Ouch!!!,"I bought this straightener after my old one, that I'd been using for years, cracked and started pulling my hair out. I only use it for my bangs, so I didn't want to spend a lot. My old straightener was another cheap model (I got it from WalMart for about $15), so I was expecting this one to suffice. The problem is that there is little insulation between the hot plates and the outside of the device. Because the plates don't meet all the way down (only at the very tip), you have to try to force it down by hand for equal heating. The lack of insulation can easily cause burns. I've burned my fingers multiple times. I only gave it 1 star because I would never buy it again. I would also urge others not to buy it."
1,Worst,"Worst product I have ever used to straighten my hair!! The steam from it caused sores on my head. My hair is still frizzy and now my head is sore. I would not recommend this product to anyone. This product promises no damage to hair but it does and it is so hot that you can't touch the ends or get to near at the bottom where the handle is. Definitely get what you pay for, I will be returning this and buying Maxiglide."
5,"great job on fine, wavy hair","I recently purchased the Remington Wet 2 Straight with 1"" slim plates for use on my fine, wavy, medium-length and layered hair, and I love it! I have used a variety of straightening irons for 10 years, and usually let my hair dry naturally curly, only straightening occasionally. My formerly curly hair is now only wavy and not in the same way! (Straight-ish on one side, a little curly on the other). I was hoping to save some time in styling, since I seem to be straightening every day, and this product is amazing! I towel-dried my hair after washing, added mousse and gel, seperated into sections, and got started. Towards the roots I had to go over the hair 3-4 times to dry it more, but the ends dried quickly and my hair has never looked better! My hair tends to be a little flat, but this gave me nice volume at the crown. I highly recommend this product!"
1,Not good on thick wavy hair,"I have VERY thick naturally curly hair and this iron did not do what it says it would. While my hair was wet I tried to flat iron it and I had to run the iron through 3 times on each section. It took forever and it still was not bone straight. Also the controls are on the handle so everytime you clamp down on the iron you run the risk of changing the setting or turning the iron off. That sucks! Lastly, the iron is just coated not solid ceramic and it chips off.DON'T waste your money!"
3,shows promise,"It isn't that she is a bad poet or that the poems were bad. They just weren't great poems and they didn't personally reach out to me. My biggest fault with the poems was that they seemed to be held at a distance from the reader. There was a certain amount of coldness for lack of a better word. They were very musical, both in subject matter (most poems dealt with music in one way or another) and in her style of writing. Schoerke handles both formal verse and free verse very well. I think she has a lot of promise as a poet and I'm curious to see where she develops from here."
2,Buyer Beware,"If this is the item you want, do not order. Item has two open log shelves (see bottom shelf) and no drawer. Perhaps seller could put appropriate picture with item description. Item is of good quality."
1,FRUSTRATING GADGET,"This was my first mp3 player and thank goodness it came as a free gift along with my computer purchase and I didn't pay for it. I'm not an electronic gadget wizard but my husband is, and he was just as frustrated as I was after trying to get the random play to work or just play music stored in it at all. I had hours of music on it, but yet I heard some songs more than once and never heard others during my first 1 1/2 hr workout with the thing. It is stylish and colorful, but that may be it's only pro. The buttons are difficult to use and it seems slow to respond, so I think you end up hitting more buttons. There are long lag times between songs sometimes for no reason. Wouldn't recommend buying it for sure."
1,This thing sucks!,"It's nice to go chargin people this much money for a piece of junk. This thing was nothing but a hassle for me and my brother. To make this short and sweet, if you don't want it to die on you, don't buy it!Get a sandisk sansa instead!"
2,"Boring, Surprisingly Shallow","I like Cortazar, I've read two novels and definitely recommend Hopscotch. 62: A Model Kit, is so-so. I recommend it if you've already read Hopscotch and love it and want another experimental novel about intellectuals lounging around and not doing much (Cortazar is not that unlike Seinfeld, but on a metaphysical and metaphorical instead of pop cultural level). These poems though let me down, I found them surprisingly shallow as you can possibly tell from the title of this review and none of them had any feeling or impact on me. None sounded great while seeming hollow to me. I think Cortazar was not much of a poet and those who say otherwise are probably fans of Cortazar more than of poetry. So unless Cortazar is one of your favorite writers, I would stay away from this one. Also its pretty expensive and once it arrives its tiny. If you don't trust me, you'll see."
2,Provacative but not without error,"I won't pretend to analyze William's argument, but I do appreciate her attempt to provide a sociobiological explanation of redemption.I did find myself unable to claim it as a reliable reference for my graduate theology paper due to some blatant and fundamental misunderstandings of Catholic teaching. I am grateful, at least, that these errors emerged within the first chapter, so I didn't waste valuable research time.This book may well prove helpful if you are looking for an expert on sociobiology in light of a Christian account of human origins. If your paper relies on accurate portrayal of Roman Catholic theology, however (as mine does), then you are best off to inquire elsewhere."
2,",,,",I disagree with the book and the whole concept of sociobiology but God bless her for maintaining her faith.
3,Not quite enough for the CIW v5 Site Designer,"I recently passed the CIW Site Designer exam by studying almost entirely from this book. I scored an 80 on the exam. Even though I passed, I don't recommend using this book alone when preparing for the exam. There are questions on Flash and security, topics which are not covered in this book. I recommend supplementing this book with other material for anyone planning to sit for Version 5."
3,Basic guide,"I purchased this book for school, it was a decent read, great for gathering some highlights and topic awareness gathering purposes. Goes father into vague topics than necessary. Perfect for a beginner, but too much for a practitioner."
2,Not recommended,"I have been buying these before (from Microcenter). They are very cheap and I thought it was a very good deal. Particularly their 2600mAh for 5 bucks! But...Cons:-Of all the NiMh batteries I tried. This has the most number of failures. Some just die. Some would hold very low charges after just a few cycles.-It is bigger in circumference compared to other batteries. Which will not fit some of my cameras and gadgets.-Exterior is made of paper and gets easily smashed, deformed.Pros:-Price. but for this kind of quality... not worth it.Also: With all the new low discharge batteries flooding the market (Eneloops, Rayovacs, Duracell, Kodak, etc.) There is no longer any reason to buy this kind of batteries. Even this company is now manufacturing their own Hybrio."
2,false labeling,"they are rated at 2600mah, however, according to my lacrossecharger, they are actually between 2100 and 2200mah. i would not buy themm again."
1,Not very good at all,"I liked the cake on the cover (which happens to be the same cover listed on amazon.com) but the photos inside were horrible. They were very fuzzy and you couldn't see the detail of the cakes that well. The cakes were just okay, nothing fabulous to look at."
3,Come on...is not so bad!!!!!!!!!!,The cover of this book does not match the one above...but does that really matters?????!!!!!!!! Is a nice cover anyway. The pictures inside???....I dont see anything wrong in them!!!!!!!Give this book a chance. The designs of the cakes could have been better but the bakers featured are not british..at the end of the day the book shows the kind of work american bakers do.
5,Five Emerging -- but Accomplished -- Poets,"Too often when reading a literary journal, I happen upon a wonderful poem by a writer who does not yet have a book to his/her name and I just wished that there were more. Well, this fine collection includes a healthy set of poems by five new voices: Lisa Sperber, Sean McDonnell, Angela Garcia, Eric Gudas and Maria Melendez (who has a chapbook from Swan Scythe Press entitled, ""Base Pairs,"" a must buy). ""Mark My Words,"" which is edited by the poet Francisco Aragon, brings us five innovative, talented poets at the beginning of their careers who will, no doubt, bring us great joy in the years to come. Some of my favorites in this anthology include Garcia's ""The Crows in Dry Season,"" Melendez's ""Remedy,"" and McDonnell's ""The Heart is Not a Zero."" Each set of poems includes an introduction by a more established writer. Bravo!"
4,Sturdy and reliable,Good item to have in your kitchen if you don't trust your oven's temperature. The bracket moves enough for you to secure it on the oven's rack. The glass tends to become a little misty as time goes by and you use it a lot.
3,good thermometer.,"the thermometer seems to work fine and is accurate. However, it is hard to read through the door window in the low oven light."
2,Hard to read,"It looks good in the picture, but the copper color makes it hard to read. Would buy a different one next time."
2,Not as pictured!,"I ordered this thinking I was getting what was pictured and to my surprise, what I got is nothing like the picture. The pictured item has a red, black copper and white background. The one I got only had a white and copper background, which I believe to be hard to read, without testing it. So I went to the store since Target's website indicated that it was in the store and to my surprise, the same one that I got in the mail - the copper and white thermometer - was in the store, not the red, white, copper and white thermometer. Disappointed to say the least, but Target needs to publish an accurate photo."
5,Sold out to Christ,"Recently saw this band live. They are excellent. This live album returned right where I was the night I saw them and the tears still stream.I strongly recommend. Shout, All The Earth, and Complete are some of the best live worship I have ever heard. If you get a chance to see in person...don't walk...RUN...to get tickets. God Bless"
5,exactly what i thought,"this was a great item, exactly what i thought it was going to look like. plus the kids loved it! i also got the matching toilet cover and rug-adds the perfect touch!"
5,Quality multi-purpose product,"I purchased this headlamp when my 9 year old wanted a book light. It works fabulous for that purpose & more. You don't have to re-position the lamp when turning pages. She can use it indoors or out for bird watching, camping, hiking or reading. It is a quality product that she will utilize for years to come."
4,"Nice, even if a bit pricey?","Nice, bright light, easy to turn on (I'm using it mountain biking). I tend to use the brightest setting rather than the broad one.I wonder if the Everreaddy one like it I saw at Home Depot the week after I bought this is as bright?"
1,Too much money to pay for a Chinese weak lamp.,"1) Weak light intensity.2) Too expensive3) No better than another lamp that I bought in Dollar General.4) And be sure that you keep your original package if you buy something in Amazon, so you can return it.5) Also, pay with your personal credit card, no with Amazon Card, so you will have any help in case of returns."
2,Bad Product,"This bag when it first arrived it looked very good. I open it, stored some items in it, and went backpacking. After two days of gentle use the back cushions started ripping. I stitched them back and continued. After a week however, I noticed that that shoulder straps started ripping. This time, frustrated but determined I reattached them and simply continued. Now, after a month of use the foam from inside the straps is leaking out.It looks so good, but the quality is bad. The textile from which it is made is water proof but it is simply too flimsy. The green threads loosen and the plastic clips detach. The plastic it has is weak, and it breaks. The insulation will peel off after some use. The joints of practically everywhere are open.Don't buy this bag, it is not worth it."
5,Backpack review,"I think that this item is one of the best ones so far available on Amazon. I think it is worth the money, definitely! It can fit a lot of stuff inside and it has so many pockets and compartments. Only thing that is kind of different in my eyes is that color on the picture available on the web, doesn't match the actual color. It is vivid olive green, not kind of grayish color as it looks. However, a very good buy."
3,Lightweight and Charming,"Novelist Agatha Christie occasionally remarked that while she was a great fan of the actress, Dame Margaret Rutherford was NOT the Jane Marple of her novels--for instead of giving us a fluttery and demure woman, Dame Margaret played the role with considerable aplomb and considerable eccentric British humor. Chrisite purists will probably be outraged by Dame Margaret's complete reinterpretation of the character, but there is no denying that she is a great deal of fun to watch.This particular outing finds Dame Margaret investigating the mysterious death of an elderly man and the subsequent murder of one of his heirs--an investigation which leads her, most improbably, to an inn catering to the horsey set. Although very free in adaptation, the actual plot follows Christie's novel ""Funerals Are Fatal"" quite closely, and a charming supporting cast--including Flora Robinson--add to the fun. Lightweight and charming."
3,A Very Eccentric Miss Marple,"This along with four or five more with Margaret Rutherford illustrate likely the most eccentric of all who have played the role of Miss Marple. What a character, who stands up to the police when they try and dismiss her as a crank. Of course, Robert Morley is a grand actor, as always, and doesn't disappoint. All of these Marple movies, are worth seeing and give you a good flavor of what Rutherford brings to the role. OK, you may want to skip Murder Ahoy."
4,Saddled for Suspense and Comedy,"Margaret Rutherford is an absolute jewel playing the amateur detective, Miss Marple. She steals almost every scene with her semi-dotty manner, but each time surprises with that smashingly brilliant and piercing British logic!Ms Rutherford's foil in this movie is the ever-droll Robert Morley, a stand-alone comedian in his own right.Margaret is also abetted in her humorously sleuthy ways by another excellent actor ... this time, her true-life spouse, Stringer Davis (although not many knew of this cinefact).All-in-all, Murder at the Gallop is a delightful canter across a country lane and is a whodunit par excellence, based on Agatha Christie's After the Funeral.The entire DVD is clear and wonderfully transferred from the original B/W 35mm negative elements.Dash it all ... what an entirely wonderful and satisfying romp!-- D. Kerr"
5,Didn't get what I ordered...but Amazon.com solved the problem promptly!!!,"What I got is beautiful - with one teeny little problem...I ordered the tulip Cognac glasses and got water glasses instead. Talk about a pain...now I have to ship back what I got and wait some more for what I ordered. Not cool, Amazon.com! (although I have to admit that this is the first time you have messed up an order for me) UPDATE: Amazon's customer service was very, very helpful and sent the correct item immediately. Love the glasses - they are beautiful as well as correctly made for enjoying cognac properly (the wider opening allows for a small evaporating surface, which helps to balance the aroma and taste while tempering the alcohol and emphasizing the bouquet)."
3,pretty good because of R.Kelly,"this song is aight, Young Jeezy doesn't do a whole lot for me with his flow,but thanks to having Kellz on board this song is kinda catchy. the ""R"" saves the track for me with his vocal pressence which makes it work. it works well in the clubs."
3,"An Enjoyable ""WWW"" Reunion","Though a bit too campy in spots, ""Wild Wild West Revisited"" (1979) recaptured the imaginative spirit of the classic series. Since Robert Conrad and Ross Martin were older, it was impossible to continue in the same vein as the 1965-69 show. Nevertheless, it's great seeing James West and Artemus Gordon together again. Director Burt Kennedy utilizes the Arizona locations to full advantage - thus giving the TV movie a big-budget look. ""Wild Wild West Revisited"" does not hold a candle to the original series, but remains nostalgic fun."
2,Not as pictured,"Received fast but wasn't the item that's pictured. Feel cheated, but still works for the price. Won't by here again though."
1,misleading,the book is only focused on the principles of ceramic construction. there is no mention of super adobe or cal earth. the cover photo is of earth one a research building at cal earth that was built after the book was written and used super adobe bags and ferrocement. there is nothing in this book that is relevent to the construction of the earth one building pictured. in closing i feel this book is misrepresented and basically useless. there are some videos from nader khalili that are much more informative.
3,it's okay,"i was disappointed because the product was expected to be in glass jars. the mustard of course was the product that i expected. i am against plastic containers. i have been a user of Plochman's Natural Stone Ground Mustard for years. I noticed the product was reduced in size but the price remained the same(a form for increasing the cost to the consumer) but this is a practice that is common and acceptable in the marketplace, today.jamie jamerson"
4,Some Medieval Reticence,"Rabbi David Aaron is a great speaker, getting his ideas across with clarity and humor. Much of this shows through in The Secret Life of God.Here, the Rabbi walks the fine line between pantheism and panentheism. He wants God to literally fill the whole universe, and have people and the universe be an expression of God; but he also wants God to be separate from people and the universe, so Judaism does not fall into what he views as the trap of pantheism.These are tricky arguments, and the neat division between pantheism and panentheism is still one that I do not see (or understand). Regardless, it is refreshing to see Rabbi Aaron express some of the more esoteric doctrines of the Kabalah, long considered dangerous, and share his trepidation in writing them down. In a world where everything is accessible and everything is uttered, it is pleasing to see a little medieval reticence."
4,Much better than expected given reviews on the Eureka 2595,Wow...this machine is really good. It cleans very well and also dries quite fast. I was worried purchasing this given the somewhat negative reviews on the 2595 which I assume is a better machine than the 2591. To ensure that the carpet dries quickly you have to change the settings at the top of the handle to suction (middle option). Otherwise the carpet will take much longer to dry. I'm very pleased with this purchase. I've had it for just a week and will do some more cleaning this weekend. If it holds up well I might change my rating from 4 to 5 stars.PS: I took the plunge to buy this despite my initial concerns because it was on sale at a 50% discount. What a great steal!
2,Don't bother!,"I'm not much on writing so I'll just get to the facts. This cleaner worked well for the first 2 times I used it but then it was all down hill. It has very weak suction, it leaks water when it is sitting still and when you push it forward.Don't buy this!"
1,Also Disappointed,"I had a Hoover carpet cleaner for 10 years that was wonderful but I put in hardwood floors and had no need for it anymore. Or so I thought. I have sinced moved and was in need of another carpet cleaner. I did a lot of research and bought the Eureka Atlantis.I just used it again and am not sure what to do because all the water is still in the carpet because it has no suction. I keep thinking of all the wonderful reviews I had read - they must have purchased a different carpet cleaner than I did because this one certainly isn't worth the money or time. It leaks water and shampoo. It doesn't extract the water as there is no suction. The brushes are a joke. Yes, I've read the instructions over and over again, including the troubleshooting section.I gave it one star because it does fold down into a neat little package - it's only redeeming quality.If I could find my receipt and get rid of it I would. Sorry I bought it."
4,Excellent Extractor!!!,"We just bought this at Walmart for only $129. Best investment for our carpet ever. It really cleans and suctions the water. Our carpets were so dirty that our feet were getting dirty when we walked on the carpet. Now the carpet looks new again (only 1-yr-old house) and everyone has to take off their shoes when entering, no exceptions. We had shopped around for a while and looked at the reviews for the Bissell and Hoover and did not like what we saw, they either broke easily or leaked after one use. We are sold on this one. We did not even have to put it together, it was ready to use. Oh my goodness, what a great buy. Walmart has the cheapest price and 1 yr warrenty."
4,"""Extractor""??",Not as easy to use as I had hoped. It takes practice to do a really good job. I am happy with my purchase even though now that I have it my carpets seem not to need much cleaning!!!!!!
2,Not one of their best,"If you loved the CD ""Right On Be Free"" or was blown away by their performance in ""Soul to Soul,"" you're in for a letdown here. The VOEH was a supremely talented group with their gospel/soul anthems of positive thinking, but things don't jell here. This CD features a number of tunes with pretty good lyrics, but the delivery and presentation lacks the power to compel the listener and the songs just don't have the memorable hooks that makes you want to hear them more than once (or even all the way through the first time). Hopefully, some better VOEH albums will see the light of day on CD."
4,bee toy,"WY AFRICAN GREY LOVED THIS TOY, BUT DESTROYED IT WITHIN A WEEK. THIS TOY CANNOT HANDLE STRONG BEAKS OF BIGGER BIRDS."
1,Has the widespread lens cap problem. Avoid this product!,"My JVC GR-D650U started to have the lens cap problem after I bought it a little over a year ago. The camcorder will not record video. It's a widespread problem that has been found on dozens of JVC products. Search for ""JVC lens cap problem"" on the internet for more information.Although JVC offers to fix this type of problems free of charge, D650U is not covered by that program."
1,VERY Poor low light performance,"I read several reviews that this camera shoots decent low-light video and by low-light, I mean a regulary lit room at the evening. The video came out like I was shooting in the dark room with no light whatsofever. The night mode is no use either...as with it video becomes like first generation of analog cameras. The build-in LED light is only good to eliminate object that is a foot away from you, otherwise this light is useless. The pictures taken inside are extermelly poor. The battery that came with camera is rated at 90 min (be happy if you can get a half of it).On the positive side...videos and photos taken with camera in a day light outside (not inside the house) are good.So if your primary video recording is outside then this is a good camera for a good price, for me it just did not work."
5,Great movie about deceptive lawyers,"Outstanding movie about corrupt lawyers and big business. Any small manufacturer who has created a unique product and hopes to distribute it through stores like Staples, Office Depot, and CompUSA, (i.e., large U.S. specialty retailers) should see this movie before talking to anyone--particularly the buyers for the retailers. This movie takes viewers through the hair-raising twists and turns of deception and corruption that lead eventually to murder."
3,So so.,"I know things become different when the spies get involved, but when Grace was in Miami, hello(?), can anyone say ENTRAPMENT? As an Englishman, I am a little hazy on what might or might not contribute entrapment in England. As someone living in the USA, who watches ""Law and Order"" a lot, I think the sting on the money launderer in Miami would definitely be so. As a novel it was OK. I wanted to know what happened next, but the characters were all a little stereotypical - except of course Flint herself."
2,Uhh...No...,"This book was okay but kind of repetitive and boring. It was nowhere near as good as the first two. The first one was definitely the best. I gave it a two because the ending will suprise you, and it does sort of keep you on your toes. All in all, if you read the first two, I would only read this for the sake of the storyline."
4,The baby sitter 3,"Jenny Jeffers goes to live with her cousin(Debra)to try and get forget the man(Mr.Hagan)who murdered all the other baby sitters. He's dead but he's every where Jenny is but when Jenny get's to her cousins house,she finds out that Debra is a babysitter and now Debra's gitting calls and threats like the ones Jenny used to get.Jenny's missing.she can't find the baby(Peter)who she baby sat.Whats Debra going to do?....Who took Peterand Jenny and if Mr.Hagans dead who else is there to suspect?Is Mr.Hagan really back from the dead like Jenny said?....If you want to find out what Debra's going to do next I recomend you read this book to find out for your self."
3,more sad than scary,"I read this whole book in 2 days and I thought it was sad I meanJenny the hero from the first two babysitter books, the one that defeated Mr. Hagen the babysitter killer in the first book and caught the crazy woman in second book ends up turning into a psycio pathic babynapper at the end of this book. That's sad, that's really sad and its shocking as well."
5,Someone's Taken Their Love Of Trilogies One Step Too Far,"I couldn't belive how terrifying this book actually was. It was probaly the most predictably of all the Baby-Sitter's, but who cares, It was brilliant. but beware, The Baby-Sitter IV is absolutly crap, I is good and II is okay, but this is probably the best"
2,"same old, same old","Back for another Babysitter thriller, R.L. Stine again brings us back. I would not recommend this book. The story line is repeated...again."
1,magnificent subject mediocre presentation,This is where the sharpness of DVD should shine through. In this presentation we have a miserable failure. The pictures have NO definition. They look like there were cut out of a third rate newspaper. What could have been a glorious addition to the DVD art catalog ends up being trash not worth the $54.00 deeply discounted price. Look elsewhere if your looking for the Landmarks of Western Art.
4,A good over-view of history of Western Art,"This set of 6 DVDs offers a very good look at the periods of Art: Late Medieval World, Baroque, Renaissance, Rococo to Revolution, Romanticism, and Impressionism/Post-Impressionism. Art historians analyze painters and their work and tell how the culture of the times affected each. For those wanting more detailed information about different schools and artists, there are other sets from Kultur which complement this overview very well. If you enjoy art in a non-academic way, then I think you will enjoy this set very much."
3,Excellent historical and aesthetic perspective,"This is a very clear, well presented series with carefully paced and measured commentary. Good experts, they keep it simple. I received a good understanding of - very importantly - the attitudes and surroundings of the artists and how that affected their creativity. Good general exposition of how western art developed and diversified, as well as the techniques used through the centuries. Strong present-day location film, pleasant tempo and music. Representation of the painting and sculpture perfectly adequate, colors and line nicely presented."
1,Karaoke Soul [KARAOKE] [IMPORT],"Very disappointed! Not really ""Karaoke"". Karaoke means background music with lyric graphics. This CD does NOT have graphics. Should be advertised as ""Background music only - no graphics""."
3,"OK, but not great","This video is ok, but after watching EJ's River Running Basics I have to say that I can see where this video is lacking. For the same price EJ's video is three times as long and goes into much greater depth. This video is still good and there's useful things in it, I know I'll revisit it. But if you're just getting started I'd recommend EJ's video."
3,"Not a grabber, but good on recent politics.","I was reminded of nothing so much as a boring college lecture initially. His style is long, long paragraphs with long sentences, stringing together seemingly disconnected facts with no linear tale emerging. But after the archaelogy and paleontology, when he gets more into sociology and politics, subjects in which he is evidently more comfortable and fluent, I felt it was worth the effort. I was amazed he was able to write such a book without ever discussing racial issues, either prejudice or discrimination based on color. I felt that was a lack. Also in the colonial discussions it had the flavor of an apologia for British actions. But he did cover the history of slavery in a clear if broad way. Ultimately I learned things I didn't know before, and I guess that's what you can get from such a book. He ended before Mandela's incredible ascent to the presidency. The book needs an epilogue."
2,Generic....,Not worth the buy. I like the way is only popular from that lame TV commercial. Decent song....But overall the CD sucks. Save your money.
3,Got the CD for one song,"Got this for the song ""I Like the Way"", which is AWESOME. The rest of the CD is pretty blah for me. I guess if I'd have thought it through, I'd just go back and buy that one track from iTunes. But since I got such a great deal on the whole CD it was worth giving the rest of the CD a chance."
2,I Like The Way but that's about it,"I saw the video for the band's ""I Like The Way"" and knew the song thanks to one of those soda commercials, but I thought the boys had a little something to offer. During my initial run of the CD I thought it was pretty good but hasn't ever totally blown me away yet. I must admit the mix of dance rock they are doing is pretty catchy, but all in all nothing sticks to you, other than that catch all aforementioned single."
1,Worst drives I've ever bought,"I initially bought one of these for a quiet PC. Because it was quiet and I never had problems with my WD 80GB Caviar I bought another. Big mistake. The first one died after a few months. The second one died a month later. The worst part is I trusted the drive and used it to back up a lot of my personal music files. I lost all those.I'm surprised because my WD 80GB Caviar was reliable. Seems they're not focused on quality anymore. After this experience I won't be buying WD anymore. I will be buying Seagate or Samsung now. The Samsung's are quiet and reliable. The Seagate I just bought to replace the WD drives that died is working great so far, a 750GB server quality drive, a bit noisy but fast."
2,"WD PATA 500GB HD, 16mb Cache, OEM","Home PC Dell 8250 XPS with Win XP with SP1, 1.5GB RAM. Easy installation into mini desktop PC. Installed Win XP software using long format (NTSF) without incident. However, after all software was uploaded, windows did not open. Could not resolve issue at that time so I reinstalled a WD 250GB HD with 8mb cache that works. At this time I do not know if this was caused by a HD size limitation or a cache limitation (8mb vs 16mb, or even a faulty HD."
3,Did Not Work,I returned the HDD because I bought it to use in my ReplayTV DVR but it wouldn't work because of the 16MB cache.I'm sure it would have worked fine in a PC.
4,excellent item,"Western Digital Caviar Blue 500 GB Bulk/OEM Hard Drive 3.5 Inch, 16 MB Cache, 7200 RPM SATA II WD5000AAKS"
2,Wholesale version of this drive,"This drive works fine, but be advised that this particular product is not the ""retail"" version. If you order this you will get a drive in a bag. No cables, no instructions, no software, etc. You can find all the stuff you need online, and HD's are easy to install...but be aware unless you're comfortable with things like master/slave configurations, jumper settings, etc. you ought to make sure you can round up all the documentation.Drive is 5 stares, packaging (for consumers) is zero stars, I call it a 2."
1,What Happened????,"What the hell happened? Believe it or not, but Taucher was the first artist to get me hooked on Trance. Return to Atlantis (CD 2) features some of the most beatifully composed Trance I have ever heard. I was expecting great things from High Tide ,Low Tide. What a huge dissapointment. Gone are the hypotnotic eurphoric rhythems that DJ Taucher is trademark for. The first CD is nothing but europop garbage. Some of the tracks sounded so outdated like they were recorded in the early 90's. The second CD features a varity of chillout tracks that are barely mediocre. Taucher should have kept the CD in Europe and not bothered releasing it in the U.S. Hide Tide, Low Tide serves as a very bad example of what I think Taucher is truely capable of. Maybe on the next CD."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this because I'd used MS2004 Bush Pilot, Seaplane Adventures, etc... and because I like the challenge of helicopters. The actual flying part of the missions is about what I expected, but what ruins it for me (and makes me regret spending $30 on it) is the backround dialogue. It sounds very unprofessional, with a lot of ""uhs"" and pauses. I just expected a lot more for a $30 product from Best Buy. Have you ever downloaded free missions that people have made? They sound cheap, as you would expect THEM to, but a marketed product like this one should definately NOT be comparable to the freebies...but unfortunately it is! If you don't mind turning the sound off, go for it I guess."
1,pc game,"I would like to withdraw my former nutral review of this purchase, Problem was not sellers fault probably mine because I didn't read description close enough.Seller was very prompt with delivery and has offered to refund and pay return shipping.Raymond Luther"
1,Mission: Blackhawk,Do yourself a favor; pass on this one. The package looks good but the game must have been done by an [...] with little education. The graphics are fair but the worst is the hillbillys that did the voice overs. It is just terrible.
1,These won't fit older ACME pens.,"I mean, I hate to do this: I love my ACME pens and use 'em daily for work. I've got nothing but high fives for the pens. Really. So I hate to be harshing on 'em.But these converters just don't fit the earlier models. Yeah, one fit my nice brand new Shepard Fairey pen. But it wouldn't fit my Ed Roth Rat Fink pen. Or my Verner Panton pen. Or, honestly, any of the eight other ACME pens I have that aren't my new Shepard Fairey one. Thems the breaks I guess.Anyway. I love the pens. I love using 'em as fountain pens. It's just too bad that this converter kit isn't universal to the older ACME models - and I'm not sure there's an alternate out there."
5,First Impressions,"I saw this cage at Petsmart and thought about getting it. Then I found out that I could get it shipped from Amazon. I had it for a few days before deciding to put it together. I had read a previous review that gave it 4 starts minus 1 because the instructions on putting it together was not that great. I agree they were not the best instructions but, only took about 1 hour and 15 minutes. I just finished putting it together and am impressed with the quality of the cage (I'm sorry HOME). I have it next to the old cage so Mango (The bird will be used to it).If you are on the bubble about this cage (Home) Click the BUY button, you will not be disappointed. It's a great Cage and the PRICE was RIGHT..."
5,Love this cage,We have two cockatiels and they love this spacious cage. It has worked out wonderfully and has been easy to clean and keep up.
1,This product gave me diarrhea as soon as I took it. Seller refused to refund me,"I bought this product because it got featured in the list of vitamins with no lead. However, it has limited nutritional value and worst it gave me diarrhea as soon as I took it. Really bad customer service, seller refused to refund me"
5,ALL TIME FAVORITE BOARD BOOK,"I am the mother of five and this book was my oldest child's favorite (she's 12 now) and it's my youngest child's favorite, too. We have bought several copies over the year because they've been loved to death. It's simplicity and the clear photographs are it's best features and the toddler could be either a boy or girl, though it's probably the latter. I'm just delighted that it's still on the market after all these years. You won't find a better value. My sixteen-month-old is absolutely enamored with it."
1,A waste of money,"I thought that I would be getting a quality item but instead it was garbage. The material is cheap, the details were dull, the necklace was also sketchy. The material is not strong AT ALL. If you test out it's durability, you will be HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED. I do not recommend purchasing this product. Next time, I'll pay a little more for something alot better. I guess you truly get what you pay for."
5,LOVE IT,"I have been looking for a cross and a pentagram, an to find the necklace with both together is awsome. I will be looking at the jelwery more often now."
1,cheaply made,"I wouldn't recommend these to anyone. the glue that held the cover to the base of the lights came loose during installation. When I advised the seller of this issue I was told they couldn't do anything since I damaged it. I didn't damage it, the product was defective and came apart. Go elsewhere if you are looking for this type of product that's what I recommend."
2,This design could use some fixing....,"This coffee maker makes good coffee, however it does have a few major glitches.If you do not set the pot back exactly in the right spot it will leak, and lets face it, how many of us are half asleep when getting our first cup (and sometimes our second)? A mess is NOT a good way to start a day!The next problem I found was the spout. It will pour out all over the floor if you tip it just a smidge to fast (again, most of us are half asleep). I have poured it all over the floor even when I was awake.The last problem I found with it was that the filters are hard to find. When you find and replace them you have to unplug the coffee maker and reset everything to get the filter light to turn off."
