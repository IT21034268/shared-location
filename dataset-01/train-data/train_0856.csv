4,On time just like they said they would,When ordering I thought this was a long shot due to where it was coming from. I needed it in time for a last minute request which the group I never heard of until I went on line. So with the trust of Amazon I figured what the heck.Researched the various titles of each song and got exactly what she wanted and now she has it downloaded onto her iphone
2,What hapenned to Nightwish?,"This album is so disapoiting,If you heared great masterpieces like ""oceanborn"" and ""wishmaster"" you will notice the huge diference,The vocals are pretty diferent,Tarja's operatic vocals are almost gone,male voice is horrible,the ""black"" voices also,the guitars are terrible it sounds like Emppu thinks he is in Slayer,the intro of the songs are not very good,the didn't worked very much on it,the keyboards are dead! they are totally gone!Songs like ""phantom of the opera""and ""end of all hope"" are ...!""slaying the dreamer"" is not bad,until the male vocals enter.so if you interested in this album don't buy it,buy Oceanborn,Wishmaster or Angels fall first."
5,Nice!!!,"I just joined the whole Nightwish ""masquarade"" a few months ago by buying Oceanborn and Wishmaster. Let me tell you what, I think this album(Century Child) is well on it's way to being it's best ever. By the way, I hear everyone talking about how horrible the male vocalist is and how he takes away from Tarja. But he is really not that horrible. He might need a few vocal lessons for sure but he in no way retracts from the AWESOMENESS of this album! I believe definitly the best song on here is either Dead to the world or Bless the Child. If your thinking about joining ""up"", this is definitly a great album to start with!"
5,go away,"beauty of the beast is the best song ever. this album is very deep, very strange, and very genius. you won't be dissappointed. this album is beautiful, there is nothing wrong with it. nightwish improves with every album and make minor tweaks, never changing. i love nightwish since the day i found out about them and this album reminds me why. tarja is incredible, tuomas is crazy insane on this album. the production is beautiful. BEAUTIFUL, THAT IS ALL THAT NEEDS TO BE SAID ABOUT THIS ALBUM. why am i even talking to you? BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!!!"
4,Amazing band from Finland,"Hearts will be broken; men will lose their minds... so, beware when you listen to this band, fronted by the marvellous female singer Tarja Tarunen. Altugh the band leader is keyboard player Tuomas, she is the high point here.CENTURY CHILD is their new album. IT has more of the same old stuff: catchy and at the same time complex melodies, amazing vocals by Tarja, a feeeling of greatness all around. The baass player is new also, a guy called Marco. I hope they release it in the U.S."
3,"Make a wish, you nocturnal thing, you.","I disagree with all the prior reviews and their hype over thisbeing ""the best"" that Nightwish has released. Although this album is GOOD... It's definitely not their best. I think I'dgive the best award to Oceanborn. It was more dynamic and variedand had some great tunes on it. Anyway... one thing Nightwishalso does well is the fact that they make the most soul pleasingballads ever known to man. But I believe the ballads on thisalbum are a bit weak. Also... this album is much more poppy insong structure and the songs are also shorter,... excluding Beauty of the Beast.When you first put this album in your CD player ... it givesa really outstanding first impression. But after awhile this CDgets a little boring. I'm also dissapointing in the keyboardiston this album as well... he just seemed like he was much betteron the prior albums.But this is a great CD... but I would recommend one of the otherNightwish albums over this...certainly ""Oceanborn""..."
5,the continuing awesomeness of nightwish,The Century Child debuts bassist Marco Hietla which takes nightwish onto another path of musical influences. This is one of the first albums to have a permanent male vocalist within the band. This album features the darkest lyrics to that date which blends with mystically-bonding music suggests a dark period of paranormal manifestation in the band. The overall quality of the album is fairly entertaining. The maturing sound with the incorporation of orchestra adds to the heavier symphonic texture of the band's sound.
2,destination downhill,"'Oceanboarn' was phenomenal, 'Wishmaster' was great and 'Century Child' is just OK. Nothing exceptional goes on here and you know how great the vocals are by now. The standout song is 'Everdream' and some other songs are better than others. The introduction of some male singer only shows how not to sing as he wrecks all the songs he appears on. Why in the world would a band do that to their album?The lack of memorable songs with charming melodies that could be heard on two previously aforementioned albums prompts me rank it as a 2-star album."
5,Fuerza en la musica,"Pocas veces he escuchado una banda de metal gotico con tanta fuerza como Nightwish. Desde ""The Carpenter"", pasando por ""Wishmaster"" como tambien por las melodicas ""Over the hills..."" y ""Away"", llega este album con finas melodias para el deleite de los buenos oidos.""Bless the Child"", ""Forever Yours"" y ""Ocean Soul"" son baladas de diferentes ritmos, con letras faciles de escuchar. Ademas, nos da un vuelco con ""Dead to the world"" ""Feel for you"" y la dura balada ""Beauty of the Beast"" que nos deja con el sabor dulce del rock pesado.Mencion especial recae en ""Ever Dream"", quiza la mejor cancion del album ""Century Child"". El 'puente' que realiza Toumas con su teclado, y la energica entrada de Jukka con la percusion dan el realce necesario a Tarja para finalizar esta fabulosa cancion.Recomiendo adquirir este disco para aquellos que deseen descubrir nuevas tendencias musicales, y un estilo que los sorprendera."
2,What Happened? We Went From Amazing to Mediocre!,"Skip this album if you are looking for an introduction to Nightwish. Oceanborn & Wishmaster are each so much better than this. Tarja isn't really given a chance to shine, and that is a waste of talent. Also, & more importantly, the new male vocalist they have is awful. Just awful. I mean truly, disgustingly, annoyingly & painfully awful. There are THOUSANDS of singers that they could have gotten to add counterpoint to Tarja's amazing operatic style. What they got was a sound like a strange constipated sneer. I hate his voice and cannot listen to any tracks he's on. Also, the music seems sub-par. I can't put my finger on it, but it just doesn't move me. Oceanborn & Wishmaster are permanently in my car & I listen to them constantly. This is going back in the CD case for a long time."
2,"Good album, comparatively not good.","If i had never heard a nightwish song before then i would consider this album excellent. Sadly, i have heard many of their songs and therore can tell that this album is lacking in many areas. Tarja, the lead singer, normally sings with immense power and projection giving the music an opera-esque feel. I felt that this was largely missing in this album and Tarja sings moreso with the attitude of a little girl. If you are a hardcore nightwish fan then i would reccomend purchasing it for the couple of very good songs. If you are not a hardcore fan i would reccomend Oceanborn or Wishmaster. Have a nice day."
1,Not Recommended.,"Awful, absolutely awful. Don't have words in my vocabulary to describe how awful this book is. It is written in the strange style of a disciple writing about his beloved master. It doesn't seem to contain any research. It's mostly a comic book account of Garibaldi, without the pictures (except the cover sketch, done by the author himself)."
3,forlani fan,"very good cast.liked technique of plot line jumping. Had some holes w/credibility as pertaining to monica's addiction, and not being able to be detected by her law enforcement superiors.liked low-key production, in this day of special effects, it was refreshing.Claire Forlani was beautiful as always."
2,banal,"""The Male Body"" is tedious and banal. Perhaps an undergraduate would find the book illuminating, but anyone who's given a few minutes thought to modern American portrayals of male sexuality will find nothing new here."
2,A disappointing effort from someone who knows better.,"Don't expect anything approaching a scholarly critique of masculinity and modern culture in this maddeningly mundane, soon-to-be-outdated litany of social observations, which avoid challenging the reader at all cost. Bardo is capable of so much more. In describing herself as a ""philosopher of culture"" in this book, she has excused herself from engaging in serious discourse (and ""disses"" the notion of discourse in the process!) on men and masculinity and instead, churns out what she hopes will be a Gail Sheehy-style best seller.Unless you're fascinated with lengthy musings on Hollywood and Madison Avenue's manipulation of the male image, skip this one."
2,Extremely Disappointed - Get Dressed to Kill Instead,"Sloppy, often boring and off-cue. Eddie's timing is off-hand he is not near as funny nor interesting as 'Dressed to Kill."" There is just not much else to say, except, while 'Dressed to Kill' made me an Eddie Izzard fan, 'Circle' made him forgettable."
2,"I have to ask: ""Eddie...why did you release this?""","The cameras must have caught Eddie on a bad day, because this video is a painful collection of awkward moments when Eddie, despite his usual genius, is simply not funny. There are moments, granted, that bring a laugh or two. Im wondering: am I laughing just because I want SO MUCH to laugh again the way I did the first time I saw Dress To Kill? Because for the most part, disappointment left me sad."
1,"Lay off the drink, Eddie!","I'm writing this review as a service to all of you who loved Dress to kill. Dress to kill was a masterpiece. It was brilliant. It was the best stand-up I had ever seen and Eddie instantly became my favorite comedian. Enter Circle. I don't know what happened. There is one good bit about jesus talking to dinosaurs, but the only thing that truly makes this video funny is that Eddie is so drunk that he can barely pull off a joke. He confuses himself constantly. He goes through a scenario only to get lost halfway to the punchline and isn't even able to execute it. He gets impersonated voices mixed up, he switches sides halfway through his 2-way conversations with himself. The material itself really isn't that funny or clever compared to Dress to kill. I hate to say it, but this performance should never have been released. It's truly a chore to sit through, and by the time Eddie left the stage, I wished I had taken the time to do real chores instead."
3,Not up to Izzard standards,"We are huge Eddie Izzard fans, have all his cd's and dvd's of concerts, have seen him live twice, love The Riches, but..... This dvd concert is not up to his usual genius. It is funny in parts but he seems disinterested, distracted and almost annoyed with the show. So was I."
3,Not as good but worth buying for a real fan.,"Well it's not Dressed to Kill but it's still worth buying. Unfortunately Eddie just couldn't get it rolling the way he did previously. Then again I must confess Dressed to Kill is probably my all time favorite stand-up routine. So nothing could compete with it. But I was hoping Eddie would outdo himself but He doesn't. However there is still a lot of good stuff that one shouldn't miss. I think that if the audience was a bit more responsive and Eddie just a tad bit more coherent (or less), the material would have done a lot better.Also the french standup bonus track and the commentary is a definite plus. As a lover of languages and a french speaking anglophone, I really love his french routine which is akward as ass at times but just as good as the english stuff. So for any true fan, by all means buy it. It's not going to blow you away, however it will give you something interesting to watch."
3,A Little Disappointing,"Having come to love Eddie through ""Glorious"" & ""Dress to Kill"", this one does not live up to the standard he's set. A few obvious edits as well as the performance made it a bit disjointed. That said, it's still Eddie & there is some wonderfully irreverant comedy to be found. Worth the addition to a complete Eddie library, but not the show to introduce Eddie to newcomers."
2,Unpolished material not DVD-worthy,"I am a huge fan of all of the other EI DVDs and have seen him in concert. For that reason, I have to say that this material doesn't warrant release on DVD. It's really slapdash, and seems like an unfortunate attempt to get another DVD out to fans prematurely. Wish I'd rented it first."
3,Just doesn't quite make it,I am a huge fan of Dressed to Kill and was very much looking forward to receiving this DVD. I am sadly disappointed. It is somewhat funny but no where near Dressed to Kill. If you are a hardcore Eddie Izzard fan then do purchase otherwise reconsider.
4,Classic Izzard,"Don't shy away from this DVD because others have said it's not as good as D2K. We recently added this to our Eddie collection, and rather laughed ourselves silly. Razor sharp wit in bits about religion, Leonardo da Vinci, the pope and monkeys with guns. How does he move about in those boots? If only he could see his way to come back south of the Mason Dixon line.Looking forward to our next long road trip and listening to the CDs of Unrepeatable and Definite Article."
4,"Very very very good, and perhaps mind boggling at times.","Okay, let me just say that this dvd if had been Izzard's only DVD, people would be talking about it all the time. Compared to his other stuff, he seems almost tired in this one. Other than the fact that he seems a little less energized in this DVD, he has some awesome skits and stories for you. Perhaps some people might find it too intellectual of humor. ie. he makes a joke ""and as we all know, machiavelli wrote ""the artist formally known as,""... now to get that you have to know machiavelli was a renaissance italian leader, wrote a book called ""the prince"" and that prince when by the name of a symbol at one point in time. Very funny, but quite a stretch...if you like smart comedy, you'll love it, if you like more kooky slap-stick comedy, perhaps this isn't for you. But I sure liked it!"
3,Disappointed... :(,"Maybe using ""Dress to Kill"" is an unfair standard to hold ""Circle"" to, but I did. And ""Circle"" dispointed me. I just didn't see the same creative humor in ""Circle"" that I've come to expect from Eddie. And from a delivery standpoint, it was almost as if he was 'phoning it in'. The animated, enthusiastic energy that he had in ""Dress to Kill"" and ""Glorius"" just wasn't there. It was almost as if he were tired or bored. I regret buying it."
2,Not Eddie at his best,"I have been an Eddie fan for about 4 years now and have seen all the videos he has out (Unrepeatable (good but hard to hear), Definite Article (my favorite, over and above D2K), Glorious (quite good) and D2K which, really, is a masterpiece. I saw Eddie in Philly for the Circle show and he was much funnier the night we saw him than he is in this show.I felt let down after I saw this DVD - it's definitely not Eddie at his best. Of course, it's been said that Eddie sucking is probably better than most of what else is out there. Some of the bits were good, but most were kind of EH.Were I to recommend stuff to a new Eddie fan it would be in this order:DK2Definite Article (seriously, this one is frigging awesome!)GloriousCircleUnrepeatable (really, just for sound quality)For lots of good Eddie stuff *AND* transcripts of all his shows, take a visit to www.auntiemomo.com/cakeordeath. She's really got an awesome site."
4,Decent,"Eddie Izzard kills me and I wanted to see all of his work...I would consider this an ancillary item if you are trying to build a complete library, doesn't keep me going back like Dress to Kill or Glorious"
3,Not Dressed to Kill,"Slower that ""Dressed to Kill"", not quite as laugh out loud funny. Still smart, fast, witty humour. It is all for the last joke, so hold on thru the slow bits!!"
3,not bad...but...,"Not their best. Not their worst. I have nothing profound to say about it really, I just thought someone should review it. I like the line ""I have got a skeleton, living in my skin"". That's about it. Whoopee."
3,"Maybe ""user-friendly"" makes it average...","It took my a while to read through the book... a sign of boring content... I would say the book is good for a beginner in this field, it provides many examples, which are easy to grasp, but which I found too basic for the more advanced reader... or which even constitute common sense.It may be well suited to be covered in High School ... not much more to add (sorry).While I haven't looked around, I am convinced there a better titles out there."
4,I have a better book for this subject matter,"Not the best written book, but I agree with the general premise. I'd recommend ""Islam Rising"" by Jim Murk instead of this book."
4,philosophically correct,"Since I am not an economist, I must leave some of the technical details of the book for assessment by others. However, the author's advocacy for financial privacy and for consumption taxes seem to be right on the money--so to speak. He writes in a very lucid and comprehensible manner."
5,Item in the perfect condition,"The VHS tapes were new, and they had no problems. Just perfect!The Real Las Vegas - The Complete Story of America's Neon Oasis (Volume 1 - Boomtown/Volume 2 - Gamble in the Desert/Volume 3 - Tarnished Dream/Volume 4 - House of Cards) [VHS]"
1,Other reviewers were right!,"When I bought home the 7 CD pack, I opened it immediately. I just wanted to know how the vocabulary builder helps an average english speaking adult, like myself.I tried the CD 5, a vocabulary builder. I realized it was for real rookies (read: grade 1 kids). The flash cards had cards for such mundane words like: eating, drinking, supermarket, trees etc... hope you are getting the drift. At about 200 words/flash cards maximum - taught through 9 different entry points, the content doesn't justify 600+MB of space it occupied on the CD (Remember Microsoft Encarta originally came in 1 CD). Amazing is that how they wasted valuable space to store .wav files for nearly 3 dozen languages to teach from! As noted by other reviewers, this is a hotchpotch collection. If this is what I sampled, I am not even wasting my time opening other CDs.You are better off reading books."
1,Total Junk,"This product is total junk. I bought this not too long ago and realized what a big mistake that was. This software has a funny interface that is not at all user friendly. Hard to get around things, totally non-intutive. Waste of money."
5,Great choice,"My wife is extremely happy with this electric skillet. It's large enough to fry a whole chicken, and then some at one time."
1,Poor heating,Excited that I found a large skillet & stainless steel. Very disapointed that it does not heat correctly. Tried to fry fish would not get to a hot enough temp. Cooked pancakes still not hot enough. Have sent an email to Rival will see what happens.
1,No power cord in box,We just received the skillet but were disappointed to find no power cord in the box too. They should have stopped shipping the skillet since they know about this.
5,A good investment,"I have owned this skillet for about a year. It has been wonderful. It is very wide, but not tall. It is perfect for paella. The skillet controls the temperature perfectly, and looks great on a buffet table or on the dinner table. It has a stainless steel finish and looks like a nice chafing dish.It is easy to clean. I am glad the skillet does not have a non-stick coating, since that finish seems to eventually come off of every pan I have owned. I season the pan as described in the brochure, and things never stick to it.I am very happy with this skillet."
1,Non-cook design,"A beautiful product to look at, but not at all practical. The lip around the top where the lid sits, bubbles the condensed moisture to the outside of the skillet. The several times I've used it, have made a huge mess to clean up! Tried to simmer spaghetti sauce, couldn't find a nice simmer temp. Either too hot, or no simmer at all. Not happy about this product."
3,Small movie with big reward,"Three stars - for solid family entertainment. A real treat if you're patient. A small budget and hard work take this movie to the ""playoffs."" (See review above.) I, too, grew up in the area of the filming (a rival: Oologah Mustangs). Some of the dialogue and acting is stiff, but you'll overlook it. The joy of a town's spirit being reborn is a warm gift to viewers."
1,I wanted to give it a half star.,"If you are an Okie (my husband is) the movie will have it's charm. If you are truly (not truLLy, Thelma)a football fan you will rally around the spirit of the movie, but for those not familiar with the twang and sloooooow pace of the central states think again before buying this one. Borrrrring! (My husband may put me in the dog house for this)."
5,A feel good film like 'Rudy' or 'Hoosiers',"I saw this film at Sundance this last winter and again when it was released in Texas this last spring. I can't say enough good things about it. One of those feel good films that you can watch again and again. It's a little slow at first, but before you know, you're cheering along with it."
4,Really?,"Can this really be the only book to tackle Big John en masse since Shoptaw in '94? And why has no-one ever reviewed it - it's been around since 2000, guys! Will no-one but a Brit tackle the Grand Panjandrum of American Letters? Herd gets 4 stars just for showing up.Ashberians may care to see my review of Statutes of Liberty (Geoff Ward, another Brit!) on amazon.co.uk. It's a whole new world out there"
5,Great action movie,"One of my all time favorite movies, and has a cute love story. Very well made, and Gary Oldman is wonderful as the insane cop. One of the movies I watch again, every few months."
5,If Dan Brown wrote Science Fiction...,"This is a really exciting, action-packed read - I love science, and this book had it all; romance, action, intrigue, and awesome science fiction. (or is it fiction?) including time travel. I loved it, and highly recommend it to anyone who loved the Da Vinci code, and who also has a flair for science. Great!!"
4,Well thought out and plotted first novel,"Highly entertaining novel with several franchiable characters.I won't bother you with a story description, you have already seen those in other reviews.I will say that I enjoyed this story and found it quite compelling. I will be keeping an eye out for follow-up titles from this author."
1,Laboured junk.,"I am afraid that will this novel, the author has mistaken a second-rate science essay as the plot for a novel. Sadly for us, he has inflicted 'Singularity' upon the readership of Amazon whereas it would have been better kept to himself. Only read if you like to read about characters directly mined from the worse cliché, a plot that drags, and writing that it is about as amateur as you can get. Avoid at all costs and lets hope the Archon Sequence ends here."
5,riveting read,"This book has lots of twists & turns - with no hint of what's around the next turn. I find it to be exceptionally crafted science fiction, rooted in concepts of ""real science."""
3,Which Singularity?,"I had thought that Singularity would be about humanity's impending approach to its post-Darwinian ""uploaded"" transhuman future via bio and nano technologies. It was my mistake, but I ended up reading the book in one sitting. I liked the romance and the Clancy-like conflict as the Russians try to exploit the mini-black hole that struck the Earth in Siberia in 1908. As for the science fiction, you have to ignore the Hawking black-hole radation formula that states that the smaller a black hole is, the faster it will evaporate away, but this is called suspension of disbelief.As for Singularity in the modern sense, I strongly recommend Kurzweil's new book, ""The Singularity is Near."" He argues convincingly that the Singularity is no more than 5 decades away. As for the religio-econo-scientific perils and promise of Singularity, and a GREAT scifi/romance read, I totally recommend Beyond Future Shock by Alaniz.Cathy"
4,Well above-average first novel; recommended,"This nice small-press technothriller sank without a trace, but it's worth looking for. It's a retelling of the Tunguska impact as a what-if it was a micro black hole? Structured as a spy thriller, it's not terribly plausible (especially the Eeevil Russky Villain) but moves along briskly, with some interesting and entertaining twists en route. Well above average first novel: recommended. A sequel is promised, but SINGULARITY is fully self-contained.Happy reading--Peter D. Tillman"
4,Fabulous!,"I have been dancing for 14 years and this workout DVD was SO much fun!Don't expect to burn all your daily calories in one viewing though, I did each routine 5 times and got a great workout. This allows you to get some good cardio and tone your problem areas if you do the moves correctly. I will be doing this every day!"
3,"Fun, but have had better workouts.","i recommend this workout video. it is a lot of fun and you do get a workout, but may not be as hardcore as some may want. however i did smile about the whole time. which is great."
1,Horrible,"I love to dance as a way of keeping fit, but this video was not for me. I suppose if you like hip hop moves, this video will be more to your liking. I find the moves to be too jerky. I tried the video through once, but I could hardly stand it. This was not what I would call a workout, and I did not even break a sweat. It is basically just learning a few short dance routines. I didn't feel like I worked out at all. I am returning this video!"
3,stuff,"My wife got it, didnt like it, said it was not what she expected. Not meant for beginginers. Still have it though."
2,ugh,It just wasn't my thing. I don't feel like I am burning calories while doing it. I feel like they are trying to be too pretty with their Makeup and hair done.. And I need to sweat!
3,"Good, but not great","I only give this DVD a three as far as it's effectiveness and general enjoyment are concerned. They concentrate too much on only one side of the body (which does not provide a ballanced workout). Also, I found Robin Anton very irritating. Her instructions were clear and her showmanship was fantastic, but she is highly repetetive. I vastly prefered her supporting/backup dancers. Overall, this only gets a half-decent rating."
1,Awful,Makes normal girls feel inadequate just watching this. and they're incredibly bouncy moving like they've consumed 10 cups of coffee! Ridiculous.
2,NOT GOOD,"I thought it was going to be a GREAT workout, um no!!! They teach you 2 of there dances.. then there is a little sexy routine you learn...NOT a WORKOUT at all!!!!"
3,okay for beginners,I bought this for my wife. She sees it as for those women who say they want to exercise but cannot or do not want to do it seriously.
3,Not quite a workout,"This is a cute instructional DVD, but it won't give you a 'dancer's body' by any means. It was fun and sexy, but if you're looking to get a real dancer's body workout, you're better off doing a mile run and and hour of yoga."
2,Disappointing,"I thought this would include work-outs that dancers actually do. Being a former novice dancer, I know that they don't just dance all the time to stay in shape. It only comes with 2 routines, and while they did get me sweating, I felt like it didn't warrant an entire DVD."
2,Pussy Cat Dolls,I found this video did not live up to my expectations. It is likely meant for those individuals who do not regularly work out and need little activity to increase their heart rate and burn calories.
4,Super fun!,i got the dvd a day after it was released and i put it in once i got home and i love it! its really fun! if you own the first one like i do and you like it then you'll defentily like this one two. so far i have only learned wait a minute and parts of when i grow up! its a great workout and the bonus 4 min workout is fly good to! i use it as a warm up! hope you enjoy it!
5,This is a purrrfecct workout alright. Makes me sweat!,"If you are looking for a workout that makes you sweat, tones, and have a dancer's body, this is the best one. Get it and you will see results.I just lost 60lbs for doing this everyday.Thank you Robin Antin and the dancers for performing and demonstrating of how the workout works.I wonder if there is going to be more Pussycat dolls workout in the future? Thanks a bunch."
3,Ok for the price,"My reaction to this workout DVD was pretty lukewarm. The moves that they teach aren't particularly new or interesting, and they aren't very good at breaking them down anyway. Furthermore, it is not the best workout if you actually want to break a sweat."
4,Fun,"It was fun. I like doing it though it is a little more towards actual dancers. Myself not being as graceful as I would like, find myself rewinding a lot to figure out how to do the dances. Overall a very fun exercise. Would recommend."
3,Great!,"Came super quick! Love it, fun, and entertaining ;) Would recommend if you just want to incorporate some type of dance into your exercise routines."
2,"Entertaining, not a workout","I purchased this DVD based off of the reviews. I workout about 5 days a week doing various exercises and fell into a rut. I really wanted something new and to feel a different kind of work out. This video is not a workout. My mother (50 yrs old, does not work out ever) did it with me and neither of us broke a sweat. We had FUN dancing and laughing at eachother but that was all.--It's hard to do. She doesn't explain the moves at all and even with my dance experience I struggled to figure out what she was doing or how the moves fit together in each sequence.--It's short. Each ""Dance"" is about the length of a verse in one of their songs so 35 seconds (about). So even once you learn it you'd have to do it over and over for at least an hour (boring!!) to get any kind of cardio workout.--It's fun. If your bored or your kids are having a sleep over buy this and have them do it!I really don't recommend buying it for fitness purposes."
1,do not buy,This is definately not a dance workout. they only show you 1 dance move that is about 30 seconds long.
1,LAAAME!!!,"This is not a workout. I love working out and have done various of other videos, this video did not give me anything except a headache. It was fun for the most part listening to old PCD songs that I used to dance to but other than that, it is not worth it, nor a workout."
5,clean jewelry,"This is my 3rd ultrasonic jewelery cleaner. Best price yet by half, great size for everything I clean such as jewelry, eye glasses and such. The last one passed away after only 4 years so I hope this one last longer.My jeweler said to use water and just add a bit of Windex and it has worked perfectly for 10 years."
4,Pleased with this purchase,"Recently purchased an ultrasonic cleaner at Wal-mart, but was so displeased with it i took it back the next morning. Searched and found this one for just about the same price, but the difference is night and day. Am very pleased with this product, and would recommend and buy again."
4,Bought for a Gift,This ultrasonic cleaner was bought for a Christmas gift for a grand-child. It arrived timely and in great condition. My grand-child says it works great.
4,9mm,"I use the cleaner to clean 9mm brass for reloading. It takes several cycles for cleaning, could be more powerful. You'll need to make a wire handle to remove the basket. I did this with some fine stainless steel wire."
5,Great,The thing that made me buy this cd was the movie.AfterI bought the movie and wached it the music inspired me to get the cd and its great.
2,What has happened to Hans Zimmer?,"What has happened to the Hans Zimmer we all grew to love with his uplifting score for Gladiator, The Peacemaker, Mission Impossible 2, and the Rock. Instead we have a composer who has slapped together some music that lacks focus and emotion. This soundtrack is especially upsetting because war movies typically create great soundtracks. Who can forget Patton's theme, or Maximus's theme in the opening of Gladiator, or the Dune's war theme. What could have been a great soundtrack to a great movie, has become a great movie with a lot of music for noise. It seems that after the screw up with Pearl Harbor, Hans has just become lazy with his work."
1,Where's rancid,"ok, so I'm just a stupid punk that gets tired of movie scores... there's no meaning except to accent films...Rancid has a really good sony on their newest cd called ""blackhawk down"" about this very movie, which I dearly believe should have been included on this cd"
3,Black Hawk Down,"To tell the truth i bought this cd as a present for my girlfriend. The song i love on it is the Barra, Barra, the others are a little to slow for me."
4,blends of tribal and electronic,this is a wonderful blend of the old and the new which stretches the average listener to contemplate the blend and appreciate it more
5,"Soulful, deep and reflective ... this is an excellent album!","Even if you haven't seen ""Black Hawk Down"", this album perfectly captures the horror, fear, sadness and bleakness of war. You would certainly appreciate this album more if you have seen the movie - everytime I hear Track 11 - ""Gortoz A Ran - J'Attends"" by Denez Prigent and Lisa Gerrard, I'm at loss for words. The utter sadness and helplessness of war seems to drip from every tone, especially since Denez Prigent has such a clear haunting voice and Lisa Gerrard has a beautiful voice as well. Don't let the sombre tone or the melancholy turn you off, though - if you love World Music and the sound of exotic instruments, you would also love this album. (Rachid Taha's Barra Barra on #2 is traditional and inviting, yet gritty and full of emotions).I would give this album five star, on the strength of Track 11 - Hans Zimmer's beautiful composition seems to package around it very nicely.Let there be peace on earth."
3,"Mildly disappointing, but well-executed","The only disappointment for me on this score was the exclusion of the music played over the trailer--not ""Knocking on Heaven's Door"" in the teaser, but the vocal number that appeared in subsequent trailers.Zimmer has a knack for composing those scores that can be patriotic, haunting and moving all at once (witness ""The Rock"" and Gladiator""). Black Hawk Down's score effectively captures the ""two opposite cultures/tribes"" theme well. I bought it before seeing the film, and at first it just made me say ""huh.."" and skip from track to track. The score makes much more sense after viewing the film, though I really didn't get that ""I remember that scene where this track was featured"" feeling when listening to it.Still, a good purchase for BHD fans...can't wait until the DVD is also released."
4,Cruden's Unabridged Concordance,The book was shipped quickly. It was in very good condition and contained extensive information. The only drawback was the tiny sized print.
5,chinese cooking at its best,"My whole family love this book, we have our favorite recipes within the book, we use it all the time, the recipes are easy to follow and the finished product taste like home cooking, each recipe has a picture of the finished dish, I like to see how my dish compares with the one on the book. This is a great book for anybody."
5,An Overlooked Masterpiece,"In the early 1980s, PBS launched a television series known as the ""Great Chefs"". The producers of the series had the great insight that bossa nova music was the perfect compliment to any exquisite dish prepared by any of the great chefs around the world.In 1983, Charlie Byrd, one of the greatest jazz guitarists of all time, began recording music for the series performing delectable melodies capturing both the essence of bossa nova and a ""good meal"".This CD is a compilation of these melodies and each track is simply delicious. Although often overlooked, this CD ranks among the greatest bossa nova albums of all time.Byrd recently passed away taking his acoustic guitar to the quiet stars joining Jobim, Gilberto, and Getz as one of the greatest bossa nova performers of all time."
2,"Good music, horrible recording.","The music is typical Byrd (good to great), but the quality of the recording (at least on the CD I have) is so bad that it is unlistenable. I don't think I have ever heard worse. Another issue that disturbs me is that the song titles and credits are not listed. This is not a purely improvised work - somebody (probably Byrd) did the compositions and arrangements and should have been given credit.This would be another top knotch Charlie Byrd CD if the publisher cared enough to remix it and rework the liner notes.Steer clear of this one, but don't hesitate to buy the many other avaliable Byrd CDs that were published by someone who actually cared about the music. Some of my favorites are ""The Bossa Nova Years"", ""My Inspiration"", ""Au Courant"", ""Brazillan Byrd"", ""Du Hot Club De Concord"", ""Moments Like This"" and ""Bluebyrd""."
2,Leaks a lot,"Since I purchased this item in the dead of winter, I had no plans to use it as a pool floater. Instead, I needed an inexpensive air mattress for a guest I had visiting. To that end, I have to say it works fairly well with the exception that from the time the person goes to bed, the mattress is leaking air. By the time he/she gets up in the morning, they're getting up off the floor, not rolling off the mattress.For what I paid, I guess it was worth it but I wouldn't trust it to keep me afloat in a pool for any length of time."
2,Not happy with amazon,"Preparing for a trip to the beach and for convenience sake, I ordered these 3 fun items, along with 2 inflatables and an inflatable boat with oars for the kids and had them shipped to our rental house. Although they were there for our arrival ( I had ordered well in advance) I was charged 3 separate shipping charges and this particular item representing 3 for the one price falsely advertised. I ended up with only 2 cheap floats instead of 6 and my other 2 purchases left us ""short"" for all the kids. Additionally, the cost of each item with the shipping charge made the purchase over TWICE what I could have bought these for at our destination. Hard/expensive lesson learned for this company AND Amazon."
2,Drake Documentary,"This documentary shows pictures and is being narrated by i don't know who. Drake is not part of this documentary, its just people talking about his talent and what they like about him. Theres many cuts of the film that come from other sources. Definitively not worth the money maybe if it was $7.00. Everything in the film i had already watched, like i said it came from other sources."
5,A Classic,"I bought ""Radiant Glory: The Life of Martha Wing Robinson"" for my husband, at his request. He had an old, tattered copy sitting on the bookshelf for years and recently picked it up to read for the first time. He is enjoying the book very much and asked me to see if I could get a fresh copy to loan to friends.As my husband is going through the book, he sometimes stops to read aloud portions to me, and at other times has mentions something from the book in conversation. The book emphasizes faith as the heart of our Christian walk and relates Martha Wing Robinson's struggles and victories. Next to the Bible, my husband says it the most inspiring book he has ever read.In fact, as the wife of the person reading this book, I can see how Ms. Wing Robinson's life is still influencing others to this day. I may read the book myself!"
3,In Touch Weekly,Pure gossip. Even more gossip than People..I didn't think that was possible!!!! But it is fun to read sometimes so I gave it a 3.
3,It's Just Ok....,"Well, like a couple of the other reviewers, getting my In Touch in the mail was like a surprise everytime. I wouldn't get three of the issues for a week and a half, and then out of nowhere, i would recieve all three in the same day. Also, what has annoyed me is the only people who have graced the cover has been Nick and Jessica or Brad and Jen. I have to question the magazine too because one issue will say they are broken up, then the next will say they are FOR SURE with the other person, and then the next would say they were back together. Its just annoying. The thing i do like most about this magazine is certainly all the stories inside. There are the same pictures you will find everywhere else but there are a lot of short articles that you can read rather than many five page articles. Its a lot more relaxing. So, although i have had some problems with the service, and am a little annoyed with their ""broad"" range of stories, it could be worse."
5,In Touch Weekly,"I used to buy this magazine EVERY, single week, and finally decided to get a subscription. Now I wait anxiously for it EVERY week in the mail. I simply just LOVE this magazine!!! From the exclusive celebrity articles to the fashion, this magazine is always up-to-date and keeps you informed on the hottest news items and fashion trends today. I highly recommend this magazine to anyone. I'll read this magazine over US Weekly, OK!, Life&Style, and any other celebrity magazine out there. In Touch rocks!!!"
3,It Took Over 2 Months to Start my Subscription,"It Took Over 2 Months to Start my Subscription. But now that it's begun, it's a great magazine and always arrives before the date on the cover."
5,By far the best HipHop CD in a long time,"Don't know what some of these other poeple are saying but this one along with Arsonists second CD are great. Every song sounds different, and there skills really show in this CD. ""ShlT Aint Sweet"""
4,Great Album that'll go unheard,"This album embodies hip-hop at it's finest. Straight underground, Arsonists stick to their roots and deliver tracks that shall satisfy and entertain. An underground gem I'd definetely recommend."
5,The beats are phat and the cuts are dope,"Phat cd by the arsonists crew. As good as their 7 inch demos, if not better. and best yet, Blaze is on the album. probably the best rap song of the 90's. This album is worth every penny. Get your groove on hip hopers!"
2,"boring, except for a few moments...","the Source said it best, its one long cipher, there's the occasional stand out beats, but some are repetitive.."
3,bargain for the price,"I'm a beginner and didn't want to pay $600 - $700 for my first road bike and determine I don't like the sport. This bike was a good compromise. The bike arrived with a broken rear brake handle. i contacted Amazon on Monday morning and they had a new bike at my door on Wednesday(a day after July 4th!). The new bike is in great shape. This was the first bike I assembled and I did it in less than an hour.I got the XL because of my height and the fact the XL has an aluminum fork. The regular Denali has a steel fork. The XL also has Shimano rear AND front derailluer. If you contact Kent Bicycles they will fax you the specs.The only complain i have so far is the fact that the front derailluer has problems up-shifting from 1 to 2. I'm sure it's a matter of adjustments, but I haven't cracked the code yet! If i hadnt recieved a defective bike the first time, I would've given it 4 stars. Overall, it's good bike for the money."
4,Bang for Buck on Wheels,"I have worked in several bike shops here and there selling and building mountain bikes, recreational bikes, and road bikes. I can deffinately say that bikes in this price range do not typically pack in as much value as the makers of this bike(Kent). I agree with one other reviewer that mentioned the necessary proper care and adjustment of this bike, but that is true to a degree for all bikes. This bike is best for those who will ride occassionally to semi-frequently with a moderate degree of rigor. I used it for my first triathlon and it suited me well. I dont suggest this bike with the intent of upgrading it later. Just sell it and move on when the time comes (likely a year or so of satisfactory use). Oh, and I would stay away from the non ""XL"" version of the bike - this version has a substantially higher quality level, while still in the entry-level category."
2,You get what you pay for.,"Pros:-It's an inexpensive bike to buy new, so it's great if you're a student on a budget who gets an Amazon gift certificate.Cons:-The build quality of the bike is shoddy.-The placement of the gear shifters is awkward.-The gears don't shift well; the chain falls off easily.-The teeth of the gears aren't very strong; I've had the bike three months and some of the teeth are completely worn down.-The wheels aren't strong; last week I bent the front wheel so the bike is now wobbly.Bottom line: You get what you pay for."
4,GMC Denali XL 22.5,"The bike was great for the price. Not perfect-but better than expected once adjusted and ridden for awhile.Pros: price, a great starter road bike, large frame(I'm 6'), super easy to pedal, frame fairly lightweight, wheelset-saddle-gearset is ok.Cons: Small pedals, my bike had 1"" headset-not 1 1/8 as stated, cheap brakes. Should have a quick release front wheel.In general you must know how to assemble a bike-as with all bikes you buy-check behind even the already put together bikes. I had to align the brake pads, adjust front wheel cones(bearings too tight), widen the seat post&clamp-clamp; was tightened without post installed to keep the clamp on the bike for shipping-but then the post won't fit- easy fix. Adjust gear shifters. The bike is getting smoother as time and miles go by.Beats paying $500 up for something I will ride on group rides only a few times a year- it should hold up fine."
3,GMC Denali XL road bike,"Not bad in the way of road bikes, it is a good entry level bike. The brakes seem to be the lesser quality item on the whole bike. Although it is very light, easy to shift, and much, much better on the road than a mountain bike. Overall, this bike would be a good purchase for the person who would want to ride about 3 times a week. A more serious rider, may require a more serious bike, but overall I am very happy."
3,It'll work for now....,"Like anyone I wanted to save some money on a bike and narrowly averted the $800 price tag at the local bike shop for a ""base model"" road bike. I picked this one up in hopes that it will last the season and I can feel out my need for a real one down the road. After some quarky assembly and air in the tires it was ready to go. It is quiet and has a very smooth ride to it with A LOT of TWEAKING REQUIRED!- Pro: It's great price. Possible resale value. Smooth ride.- Pro: If you don't look too closely it looks expensive.- Con: Cheap red sticker they placed over the whole black painted frame.- Con: Finicky side pull brakes need to be upgraded.- Con: Cheap rubber covers on brake handles pulls apart out of the box.- Con: Ideally needs a professional to tune it out of the box."
1,Owned over a year - HATE IT,"I have had 7 spokes break, replacing them as they break and checking to make sure they were all fine before rides and yet they still broke. Its cheap, looks good, but the quality of bike is horrid. I bought it because i liked the look and it was cheap and not i wish i would have spent a lot more and gotten a good name brand, i recommend you do the same. The paint starts to chip after awhile too and you need a tune-up literally every month....which would make it more expensive that a good name brand in the long run. hope you read this before you buy."
3,Shipping Issues,"I bought this bike and while it's not a bad bike overall, my issues stem from the shipping of the bike. The back rim was bent when I got it. I should have sent it back right away but had the rim trued up and it still isn't right and has had 3 spokes break on it. I am now sending the rim back for replacement. Other than that, for the money it's not a bad bike!"
5,Better than expected!!,"I was a bit skeptical when I ordered these, but for the price I thought I'd give it a shot. I actually ordered 7 of these for a new house we are building. I was soooooo happy when I opened the boxes. They are gorgeous and the quality is just as good as the local lighting store where I would have paid 4 times as much!!! They are neutral enough to match most decors. I love them."
3,PALATABLE FORUMLA,"Although I found this book to be a generic formula, I enjoyed it. The photos of the hounds are fresh and appear to be current.This is just a nice little starter book for people who are interested in beagles and who enjoy photographs of the winsome little hound. As the owner of a beagle, I enjoyed this book and smiled at the antics of the hounds."
5,The Hanukkah Lounge,This is the Best Hanukkah CD I have ever heard but this CD is for people really enjoy a nontraditonal rendition of tradition Hanukkah music. Highy Highy recommended .
4,"Slippery, but sturdy","I specifically bought these sleeves (and purple ones of the same brand & quantity) so as to not give away deck information to my opponents (since playing in green sleeves generally means that you play green, etc.) -- they've done a great job of avoiding that aspect of the metagame, even in an ongoing sealed league.As for the sleeves, themselves, they're a bit stronger than the standard Ultra Pro that is what I usually play with (if only because you can buy them in 50-sleeve packs, and I can get them locally)... but they are a bit slipperier as brand new sleeves than the Ultra Pro ones usually are.Of course, if you tend to take good care when shuffling and storing your decks, anyway, then the slipperiness isn't as much of a problem as the durability is a boon."
5,Great sleeves and they come in a box.,"I've never had a problem with Dragon Shield sleeves. They are durable, shuffle well and fit MTG cards great. They also come in a box that will easily hold a sleeved deck and sideboard (75 cards). I do still buy other brands, but I often regret buying cheaper sleeves. You can see through the white ones a little, so I wouldn't recommend them for cards that are really worn or for decks with Alphas, but I've never noticed this problem with any other color. I use the silver ones on my artifact deck and the color really goes well the modern artifact card frame."
3,Silver Box and Sleeves,Disappointed that this is a box that comes with 100 sleeves but can only fit 80 cards with the sleeves on them.Both the box and sleeves are of good quality though.
2,Meh,"Overall, these card protectors were just not worth it. A shoddy cardboard box and card protectors that just don't hold up for the price. If you buy Ultrapro protectors and an Ultrapro box, you will have a much better product for nearly the same price."
3,After use enthusiasm with quality dewindles,I've owned this wok for approximately one year and it has had minumum use;maybe twice a month. Once before I had used it and one of the four plastic support legs was loose so I tightened it with a screwdriver. My wife usually uses it the majority of the time. Today while making fried rice two of the legs loosened and the wok sat on the counter. After washing it I looked at the legs and noticed that on each leg there is a minute piece of plastic that fits into a small hole in the base of the wok that prevents the leg from turning. Several of these were missing. I put locktight on all the screws and tightened them but stripped one. The screws are simple metal screws. I thought that I was buying quality. I also noted that the price has dropped dramaticly since I paid eighty some dollars for mine.
5,NOTHING BUT RAVE REVIEWS,"I have been ""wok-hopping"" for 25 years. Bought this beauty, which will hold fried rice for 15, and now you can call me ""Dunlookin'""Hurry before the price goes back to what it's really worth!"
5,Wet wet and wild,"As the Clum authors say about acting gay in this Book it can often get wet, wet, and wild. To my knowledge, it is the only book which covers a formal way to portray Homosexuals."
3,"AS usual, Winslet shows her amazing talents","Winslet was great once again and I believe if it were not for her acting, this movie may have been a total flop. The story line is somewhat difficult to follow as far as getting into the depth of these to main characters which lead to an ultimate stunning ending. I did see that they tried to inject a litttle humor in it but it just lacked something. In whole, the film was entertainly odd."
4,RIPPED FROM THE HEADLINES. AN EARLY (1994) PETER JACKSON DIRECTION/PRODUCTION.,"KATE WINSLET'S Film debut in an over the top performance. Paired with MELANIE LYNSKEY (who was absolutely magnificent in her role), Two TROUBLED teens meet, BOND, create their own world and devise a plan (crime) to remain together. The story is written around a diary kept by the MELANIE LYNSKEY character of a grisly, premeditated murder (THAT REALLY HAPPENED).Very definitely a PETER JACKSON movie (filmed in New Zealand)."
4,The Art of Adaptation,"Lest there be any doubt, Peter Jackson's skillful adaptation of this true story prepared the way for his masterpiece, ""Lord of the Rings."" Abandoning chronological order to focus on audience-pleasing drama, he takes the time to establish the fateful bond between the two leads and from it spins their trail of liberation and destruction. A must-see for any storyteller faced with adapting a true story."
5,Mesmerizing is the word,"I'm so blown away by it I'm not sure where to begin. It's possibly the most complex film I've ever seen - layers upon layers of meaning, and yet the film doesn't feel 'heavy' at all. Disturbing, but as others have already stated, utterly truthful. You get sucked in and can't get out, it will be on your brain for days."
4,Anne Perry the murderer???,This movie is lovely and sad and has amazing moments.I'm still stunned by the fact Anne Perry was one of the teen murderers!
5,A Heavenly Treasure!,"This movie was the best! Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey were excellent as two bestfriends who commit matricide so they can stay with one another. The script is brillant,as well as the visual effects. See this movie, you won't regret it!"
4,Deep in the mind of a teenage girl.....,"Absolutely shocking, very bold piece of cinema. I didn't expect much from the film initially but on the very first view, I was left amazed, totally in awe as the film had completely taken me back to the 1950's when the really sad incident took place. Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey deliver a satisfying performance, their chemistry is dazzling to witness on screen, the rest of the cast do a very remarkable work. The fact that the film is based on a true story had me thinking twice. 'Heavenly Creatures' shines with good character study, cast-performance and direction and most of us make us all witness two teenage girls in a real dramatic and thrilling journey of their life, leading to shocking consequences. Worth a watch."
5,It's all so frightfully romantic!,"HEAVENLY CREATURES is the best film I have ever seen in my life! I first saw it on TV in July this year, and have since been hypnotized by it. I rented the VHS (and subsequently the DVD) the day after I saw it on TV. I have seen it for six times now. I have ordered the DVD of the uncut version on amazon.com. It's intensely mesmerizing, and I was utterly absorbed and consumed by every bit of the emotions the girls portrayed in the film. It's haunting, beautiful, sad, frustrating, innocent. I did research into the murder case online and actually delved into the details of every main character shown in the film. Driven by desperation, I got to the extent of having dreams about the additional 8 minutes of the original film that's not released in the earlier North American version. I deem Peter Jackson the most ingenius and creative film-maker in the modern times. ""It's all so frightfully romantic""!"
1,"Great movie, horrible DVD!","Please, save yourself some aggravation and wait for Miramax to release an official Region One DVD! Peter Jackson's luscious cinematography, originally screened in 2.35:1, when cropped to 1.33:1 is enough to make you cry. Audio is poor two-channel stereo, and there are no extra features. I purchased this Canadian import over a year ago because I love the film, but I've watched it only once because of its inferior quality. Have patience!"
4,Very Disturbing Indeed!,"This is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. The movie doesn't start off as a tragedy, rather as a comedy or light drama. I wasn't prepared for the horrible ending. And what made it worse was the fact that it was true. The girls in this movie were clearly disturbed."
5,My Review,"The video was very well directed movie. The way the became best friends and their mothere tried to seperate them but nothing would, thats when they decided they were in love/"
5,Best movie of the last century !,Peter Jackson is a genius. It's Winslet's best film. Everything is perfect.
3,"Disturbing movie, made with a delicate touch","Heavenly Creatures is a dark tale of two very disturbed young women, a showcase of their intense bond and their slow tip over the edge. Together they create a fantasy world which soon outpaces their dull and often oppressive reality (New Zealand in the '50s). Peter Jackson shows respect for their fantasies and handles their relationship with a surprising delicacy, all the while leading us down the dark path to evil: a brutal murder in cold blood. Kate Winslet provides a believable if somewhat smug interpretation; Melanie Lynskey's characterization is a bit one-sided; but they work well together. Their relationship drives the movie, which regardless of your opinion of it will stick in your head for some time."
4,FORGET TITANIC!,"After watching Titanic, i wanted to see more of Winslet's works and rented heavenly creatures. Kate Winslet was absolutely stunning in this flick. She does a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful and outgoing upper class teen who befriends Lynsky. This is definitely her best act yet. I also have to give props to Melanie Lynsky who protrayed an odd loner. You guys have to see this flick. It makes you reflect on yourself if you ever had a best friend as a teen. BUt also makes you wonder what can truly lead to their decision to murder. The actresses/actors are brilliant and the cinematography is great. Although I feel that Titanic is a better movie, this is still Winslet's best act yet."
4,This is the only bizarre movie I can really relate too.,"About this movie:Well, I think that Juliet Hume is a babe and Paulina is intelligent.My mom and my sister mocked on me for watching this(they said it sucked)but, they couldn't be more wrong.I didn't think it was a classic but, I fell in love with those girls' relationships.I didn't like all the gore though and Charles is a bit of a freak.Mario Lanza rules and Orson Welles is great in Citizen Kane."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I saw all the 5 star reviews and thought I would check it out.I really don't understand what was so great about this movie.It wasn't suspenseful at all,it was too slow paced,it seemed to be half fantasy and half reality.It just seemed to go off in all different directions.I was sitting there thinking to myself..."" What am I watching here?"" A wasted 2 hours"
2,Plane lover - just not this airplane,"This was a gift for our daughter's second birthday, who loves airplanes. This toy did not hold up to our expectations. It is heavy and durable, but it can not be steered making it difficult for a child to manuever. It is big and bulky, so storing it is a problem. Right now, the flyer is parked in my daughter's bedroom, which is probably not what the gift giver had in mind. Also, the steering wheel is easily dismantled by children, and the dismantled parts can be a potential choking hazard. I would not recommend this toy unless you just want it as a decoration in a child's room."
1,Staples for surbonder Stapler,"This product doed not fit the staole gun, so I purchased some staples. I returned the first shipment, But the second was just like the first ,would not fit the Staple Gun."
1,"The PS3 does NOT need one, grossly overpriced","I suspect that this item is mislabeled. There is no need for a 'PS3' memory card whatsoever. The original PS3 models did have the ability to read memory sticks and other formats but this is no longer the case. Anyways, the idea behind the PS3 being able to read memory sticks was for someone to take it from a camera or some other device and 'stick' it into the PS3 to transfer photos or whatever other content. There isn't and there was never such a thing as a PS3 MEMORY CARD.And, since this is a memory card, for about the same amount that this item sells for, you can get a SanDisk stick that's EIGHT TIMES as large:SanDisk 8GB Memory Stick Pro Duo."
5,Great for RTS fans,So far great gameplay and music. Easy to learn controls and in-depth tutorial puts you into the action right away. I have a friend that also owns this and suggested it to me. We mostly just play together in multiplayer mode. I haven't gotten into the campaign mode yet but from what I saw it looks to be a pretty in-depth system.
2,Very Buggy,"This game is very buggy. Even with the so called 1.1 patch and the newest 1.2 patch there are still two many bugs to list. The game can be fun at times but the amount of bugs ruins the entire experiance. I have stopped playing this game months ago and I wouldn't recomend this game to anyone, until there another patch release."
1,great game IF they'd fix the bugs and the AI,"First time I played RTW I thought that was the best game I had ever played, the graphics are stunning, the game play amazing and the strategy and tactical aspect very fun...So why the 1 star?Well as you progress through the game you come to realize that the AI is severely flawed, this combined with severe bugs make the game impossible to lose against.There is an infamous bug with loading games which make the AI reevaluate incorrectly their situation and lift all sieges. If you play long enough and don't reload you will still find the AI is hopeless at sieging your cities, as soon as you've built walls the AI won't be able to capture your city even with siege engines...Hopefully the creators of the game will some day decide to fix those problems but apparently they have a 2 patch policy only and those patches have already been released without solving those problems..."
2,Eye Candyed Game,"Im here to express my feelings and thoughts. I respect everyone who gives their opinion about Rome Total War. [...]You see, Im all about good games and Rome isnt one. Sure I liked the graphics when I first saw them. But the graphics arent everything, there will be much better games than RTW, regarding graphics.I can understand how one can be turned into a complete RTW fanboyish by just looking at the game for the firts time. Its completebly understandable, most of players are eyecanded, they simply dont care about anything else. I, on the other hand, like a balanced game, one that gives me the sense that Im playing a decent opponent. RTW is not one of those, the AI is completely idiot and it has some bugs that can destroy the Strategy-Game-Player experience. [...][...]"
1,"Potentially Great, but bugged and poor service",Update: They have released a 1.3 patch and do not require you to buy their expansion set. It seems they have corrected the load/save bug and a few others. AI could still be improved though.Note Amazon will not allow me to add stars to my old review...
3,Save your money,The designers departed from the tried-and-true system of territorial movement of Shogun and MTW. The period is wonderful...the graphics great...but you can get the same play by purchasing Legion from Strategy First for a lot less money and a lot less memory. The game does not play smoothly. I am going back to MTW.
3,"boring, and way too buggy","-the game crashes to desktop too often.-the game sometimes freezes up when loading to a battle, rendering the rest of that campaign unplayable since it will ALWAYS crash if you load up and try to fight that battle again.-sometimes the music crashes and plays an annoying sound over and over.-this game is just flat-out boring. really a step back from medieval.avoid"
5,Gold Standard for Stragety games,"For those who like to combine empire building and tactical combat, and who doesn't, this is the new Gold Standard.While the AI on all but the hardest level is pretty tame, the actual battle field gives would be Caesars a chance to see if they have what it takes.Forget to hold reserve, forget that the besieged will hit you when your back is turned, pick the wrong formation and terrain, all these will kill you.Yes,there are a few glitches, particulary in building your legions in the early game, and it would be nice to play the Carthaginians or Egyptians or Pontics for a change, but over all,this is the one that will eat up much of your time and give you the best bang for your buck. It's what every new game will be judged by."
1,Major bug prevents you from saving game,"The computer player's AI is reset after every save. After a save, the computer player lifts sieges, does nothing with its armies, doesn't build anything, and its diplomacy is shot.If you are buying this game and intend to play against the computer, buy a different game."
1,Bugs Bugs Bugs,"This game was great fun at first, but I soon had to realize how the [...] AI (this is due to a ""reload bug"") made it way too easy to beat a whole campain on ""very hard"" without loosing a single battle. If you have an iq over 60 you'll be bored as the AI wont be able to work out a plan against you, thus just moving around sensless and confused. Luckily this is not the only bug, as there are many more. CA could have done a little work fixing the bugs, but they seem to not care at all about their customers. Actually they're at the point of denying the bugs now. Poor work. Game had great potential, but couldnt live up to it. Don't buy it."
2,Dissappointing,I've played the TW series since they first came onto the strategy gaming scene. I'd highly recommend STW or MTW to anyone who's interested. RTW shows great potential but the game isnt ready for sale. There are numerous bugs and faults that make this game virtually unplayable unless you can leave the game running in the background. Other less serious problems require player developed modifications to fix. The developers have refused to address the serious problems with the game. Check with the independent fansites and dont buy it until it is fixed.
1,Could have been great,This game had the potential to be one of the best strategy games of all time. Unfortunately the gameplay is ruined by several glaring and massive bugs that disrupt the single player game and ruin the multiplayer. Perhaps another patch would fix it but at this point it seems unlikely that the game will recieve any more help.
5,A Power House of a Strategy Game.,I've spent the last 2 days slaughtering Gauls and holding back the Carthaginians. Need I say more? This game is worth more then the 50$ price tag they have put on it. Buy it if your into strategic battles and epic game play!
1,Wow WHat a disapointment,"Crap Crap and more Crap. Poor game play, weak concepts, no fun at all. This game may be realistic, but realistic isn't always fun. Way to difficult to control a battle, campaign mode is boring and stupid. No city building is the real sense, poor empire maps, and way to big to navigate. Too much is going on behind the scenes. Where do I get my money back!"
1,Garbage,"I just bought 3 coasters. So, ZERO stars, really! Althought I have more than enough in terms of system requirements , 24 vs 16 Sound Card, 1429 vs 1200 CD, etc, it will NOT play past the beginning of the 1st tutorial battle. Believe me, my PC is NOT loaded with all kinds of space wasting junk. There's no other game on my PC. I uninstalled and re-installed it yet it STILL won't go past the tutorial before crashing to desktop. I will NEVER buy another game by this company again. PERIOD. If there was an ""I want my money back"" star system, I'd give it 5. Perhaps one way to not rip off consumers would be to highlight the teeny little note on the bottom of the box stating that anti-copying technology might (yeah) make this game uncompatible with some disc and video drivers."
2,Great potential crippled for slow player,"If you are the kind of player who can't play more than a few turns at a time (due to RL constraints), you will be very disappointed by this game. Due to an annoying bug when you reload a save game, the strategic AI is completely checked in his development (few countries will be able to expand beyind their intial borders).Which means no challenge at all on the strategic level and quite a boring game.PYJ"
3,Good game ruined by bad customer support.,Rome:Total War is an enjoyable game to play.Graphically the game is great to look at.However the play can be a bit lacking.The game could be alot better.But do to poor AI and bugs in the game as well as problems implemented since the last patch and the poor customer support for the game by Activision/Creative Assembly due to their denial that the problems actually exist and refusal to fix them.The game could easily get a 4-5 stars IF the problems were not there but I cant in good concience give any better than I do.
3,"Puzzled by ""perfect"" ratings.","After seeing perfect/five-star ratings for this game, I bought it. But then I PLAYED it. Within minutes I saw troops that could easily be attacked from behind without fighting back. I found the battles very easy as one can simply bait a unit in, then attack from behind in this manner. Is the game ""perfect"" to many because they can use the bad computer AI to always win the battles? The more one plays 'Rome', the more problems they should be able to see. Sure the graphics are great as one can zoom in on battles. Be warned though, if you zoom in you will see just how awful the AI is. See your units fire arrows right into the backs of your other units, even right into the back of the head of the fellow right in front of them. You can do nothing but shake you head as your guard towers auto-fire, blasting your own men as they try to defend the city. This is a perfect game? Go figure."
1,Could be good BUT,This game is great if you can play multiple turns in one sitting. However there is an issue with the save game feature where the AI basically resets every time you have to load your game. So if you can only play one or two turns before having to save and then load again later the AI will not expand at all. You are left playing a fatally crippled opponent.
1,Total Letdown,"Despite ground breaking graphics and a great deal of innovative stuff, overall this is a disappointing game. Too many bugs, a lack of solid gameplay and pitiful AI."
2,A great game if it weren't for the crashes,"This is a good game, but the main problem is the frequency of the crashes. After a day of stable play, it started to crash to the desktop after every turn, then every time I tried loading a saved game. A real, real shame, because it is an impressive concept. I installed three different patches, to no avail. I think you need a lot more familiarity with computers than I have in order to solve the bugs by tinkering befor you can truly enjoy this program."
3,Don't be hypnotized by graphics !,"Based on graphics, this game had the potential to be great. Sadly, it falls flat and becomes unplayable to more observant players due to the terrible implementation of battles. One's only option for a 'playable' game is to play the scenarios and 'auto-resolve' battles, disregarding the much hyped battlefield scenes. The failure of this game is the result of terrible workings of units both manually and through its AI. Battles are a burden as attentive gamers must constantly ""babysit"" each of their units through the most basic of movements and individual fight choices. Children or other less conscious players may enjoy just charging armies into the enemy and smile with no regard to how many of their own soldiers die. These are ones that will rave about the game. Those more aware however, will wonder why those basic problems were not fixed before the game was released. Rome TW IS a beautiful game to watch, but NOT an enjoyable game to play."
4,great game but a bit fast,"i just started to play the game and found it fantastic. the graphics are breathtaking and the game will work well with even pretty antiquetated computers. the only problem is that the pace of the game is too fast compared to the pervious total war games, but once you get used to it, you don't even notice it."
5,Rome Total War: Total fun,As a long-time fan of Civilization series I was on the prowl for some strategy game that might keep me away from my Civilization addiction.I must say I found it : RTW blends in an awesome way TBS (the campaign map) and RTS genre (the battles).The game has it's flaws (such as the naval battles which are abstract and self-resolving and the management/strategy part is very simple compared to civ) but only minor ones at that.The battles are cinematic like in the movie Gladiator. The graphics are awesome. And the music is excellent. I love the quotes between screens.Highly recommended game. And the mods for it are looking truly spectacular. You MUST buy this game it's as simple as that.I cannot wait for the expansion pack this September. Just be careful not to become too addicted :lol:Drakan
1,I really wanted to love this game,But I couldn't even get it loaded. Not on my Athlon 64/1gig memory/Nvidia video card loaded desktop or the Pentium 4 loaded desktop or the other Pentium 4 loaded desktop. Or the brand new ATI Radeon 9600/Athlon 64/1 gig Ram notebook. And I'm not totally sure that it's coincidence that my brand new CD Drive died while trying to install.A quick trip to totalwar.com indicated I'm not the only one. Apparently this game is loaded with installation bugs. I am sure that this is a great game but not worth the stress I endured for five hours performing work-arounds and trying to get this thing to load.Read the forums on their website before you buy this game...it's a shame...I REALLY wanted this game.
5,The best game on PC,"I love this game. You don't need good reflexes like most other RTS games and the game is almost perfectly balanced.This game has ""SCALE"". It is awesome to see your army of 2000 troops charge into the enemy from the front, then charge the rear with your 600 cavalry and force them to rout.The graphics are outstanding, the sound is very good (I love it whe n an opponents troops scream ""Retreat"" or ""Run Away"") and the gameplay is nearly perfect. The only problem I have is all the micro-management you have to do at the near end of the game, managing 45 proviences, 50 family members and at least 150 units on the map.Overall, buy this game, it's one hell of a history lesson and you won't regret it."
5,Beautiful,"This game is the one I've been waiting for ever since I started playing video games. The ability to place yourself as a general commanding realistically rendered units as you look out over the battlefield. Its the ""almost being there"" quality that gives this game the ""Wow!"" factor. On top of which you get a strategic campaign mode game to link your battles together.The animations are highly detailed and can be pushed for detail as far as your video card can handle them. The controls and views are all intuitive or easily learnt and there are fun elements like your General giving a speech to his men before the battle or units cheering as they defeat another enemy. A recent patch has ironed out virtually all the irritating bugs and while there are still a few quirks none spoil the gameplay.Definitely one of my best buys"
4,"If You Like War Games, You Have to Play This!","This game is great! I am absolutely bowled over. I wish I had more free time to get into the game and to play against others on-line. The graphics, campaign mode and battle engine all play very well. There are some limits that are frustrating, such as not being able to play anything but a Roman at first until you have completed a complete game. Second you can't replay any of your campaign battles. I hope that this is fix via a patch or something in the future as it would be very helpful during long campaign hours. It would help when facing certain armies again. All in all this is an incredible game that will lend itself to hours of pure gaming enjoyment. If you like war games, this is the game for you!"
1,Great but dissapointing crash & freezes,"The game as many of you have said is great - but for one cardinal fault - it's full of crashes & freezes. I have experienced it myself and I thought it was my system, but after going thru the forum at the RTW official website - I find that a whole lot of people are complaining about it crashes & freezes.I'm very dissapointed at Creative Assembly for not acting to solve this issue and can dare say that I've wasted my money buying this game cos its just so damn frustrating to play!! (with all the freezes and such).A great game, great pity too that it's freezing all the time."
1,could have been a great game...,"The game is too buggy - every time you reload, the campaign map AI completely resets itself, and the battle AI isn't much better either. The lack of a willingness on the part of the developers to even admit there's a problem is the most disturbing part..."
1,Rome Total War should be called Creative Assembly Total War,"This game is okay, if you ignore the host of bugs present even at the v1.2 stage. [...] I would have expected a product that is at least marginally playable.. However, it seems that marginally playable is the minimum that Creative Assembly aimed for. [...] However, for everyone else, I do not recommend this bug riddled product. There are a slew of major bugs with their latest patch.[...] I advise you to research the game heavily if you do decide to buy, and see just how buggy it is. The low rating is because of the amount of bugs in v1.2 and the fact that they will not be fixed by the company (so they say)."
2,"Good idea, poor execution.","While this game is visually stunning, it lacks the challenge of a quaility strategy game. There are several game design flaws that result in a particularly weak computer opponent. Definately not 'Game of the Year' material."
5,The best game on earth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Rome Total War is the best game I've ever played, which is unique because I have a lot of real time strategy games.The graphics are AMAZING- you can see every little detail of soldiers who are fighting in the epic battles!there are a few downs though, you must have the minimum requirements or the sound in the in-game movies sound weird, so I suggest that you make sure that you have the requirements for maximum enjoyment.overall, I think that this game is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO worthwile to get- this game is 92% strategy, and 8% skill. THIS IS A MUST - GET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BELIEVE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Pity,"Very nice game. Super Idea. Great graphics. More than I could imagine about a PC game, until I started to play it. Unfortunately sometime after you install you'll face some problems of performance. After playing for 2 or 3 rounds it became very hard to play, slowing down considerably, becoming choppy, answering with delay to every command. A pity."
1,"Until its patched, the game is dead....","Like MANY others have already said. Until there's a pacth AFTER v1.2, this game is dead in the water. It has serious flaws INTRODUCED in the 1.2 patch that are just game breakers. Avoid until CA decides to treat their customers fairly."
1,A Mess!,"This movie is a mess on all levels, it's all over the place, my most memorable was when Miller's daughter got the phone call from Queen she jumped up off the couch pulled a gun out from her back then ran out the house, now that was stupid at it's best and funny, all the men in the movie go dreadlocks smh plus everyone talk as if the movie was made in some part of the south or neworleans,this movie is not worth money, they should just give it away!"
1,Wow! Bad,"When I first saw the trailer front this I thought it was a high school drama group using personal cameras to tape themselves. Then after watching iMovie I realized a high school drama group would put on a better show than this crap. The acting is bad, the story is bad and the dialogue is awful. The boost annoying thing is the fact that NOT ONE person can say their lives with any realism, it's like they brought people off the streets and said here's a script....now Action.....two thumbs down, should of spent money on getting actors not big ass cars."
4,Good Overall,"Some of the ideas are a little off the wall, but for the most part, it is stuff you might be able to use..."
4,Great Ideas!!!,Who would have thought should run through your mind reading this book. Great Ideas for those of us who want to break the doldrums of working in an office everyday for someone else.
2,"Softens the image, looks too green","This wire might be ok for tv's that look too red or for signal sources with a lot of video noise, but the image looks too green and detail is softened to the point of looking slightly smeared. You have to shove the plug tightly into its input jack, lest it slip out or make poor contact. I have generic no-brand s-video cables from RCA and Recoton that perform better than these. At least Cables To Go doesn't look as bad as Monster's overpriced rip-offs, but they aren't all that great. Has lower contrast and a less snappy image than I'm used to with other brands. In use this cable looks an awful lot like some Radio Shack stuff I once owned."
5,Great for beginners or children,"I used this for my teenage student who I teach Japanese privately. It has all classic Japanese songs with English translation for easy understanding. Also, comes with karaoke. I think great for learning Japanese through classic songs."
2,Missing CD,When I received my textbook it was missing the text CD so I had to return it and get a refund. It was very inconvenient because I fell behind in my assignments.
1,"Dull, dull, dull!","What a disappointing story ~ usually I like her books but a submissive man & a totally annoying & unlikable dominant woman just did nothing for me. I was interested in how she would make this relationship work but this ""switch"" just left me bored."
2,Pretty High Ick Factor...,"This author reaches outside her past range of character-driven highly sensual historicals (both of which were darn good) to an intense contemporary BDSM story. Included inside is everything from an informative discussion on whip...thickness, to various fantasies including geishas, vikings, space captains and far more about the safe sex use of dental dams than I EVER wanted to know---ICK! OK, ok I appreciate her grown up approach and if this is your cuppa' tea you'll find information and an interesting story of two strong contemporary characters. However, I'm still the sentimental sort who prefers being taken to cocktails rather than a cat o' nine tails."
3,The Switch,This is the first book that I have read by this author so I really didn't know what to expect. The writing was good so I will try another book by the author but as far as this one goes it was just an okay read for me. I liked the characters and most of the story line. I wasn't crazy about the historical written fantasies that Sean and Beth shared with each other. Those portions kinda dragged for me. I am also not a big fan of femdom but knew that going into the book however it was tastefully done in a yummy erotic sort of way.
1,The Big Confusion,"Well, I read it to the end, but this was a hard piece of work! The story is pretty weird and so is the style of Mr Janes. You never know who's talking or who's thinking what. There are way too many characters introduced - Kohler and St Cyr are confused most of the time and after a few pages the reader's in the same situation. But at least St Cyr makes the right remark about all this on almost every page: ""merde""."
2,"Great Concept, Mediocre Execution","This is the ninth book in the Canadian author's series set in occupied France, featuring a detecting duo of one German Gestapo agent, and one French Sureté officer. I love the concept, but the mystery--set in Lyon, a few days before Christmas in 1942--is a confusing mess involving way too many characters and bizarre motivations. Also, the author's style of preceding a character's dialogue with their interior thoughts gets annoying and intrusive. All in all, the book was not satisfying, and didn't tempt me to seek out the others in the series."
2,l;ogitech notebook stand,"This product will not work with front audio/microphone plug-ins without modifications.I returned this unit and purchased the Alto Notebook with the ""wireless keyboard"".Drilled a small hole for audio plug-in and all is well.Very pleased but there are other stands available with an openingslot for the plug-ins however this unit appearance is top notch - simple mod and I believe you would be totally pleased !!"
3,Could be 5 Stars,"I like the product, but it does not work well with my Sony VGN160G Laptop. The laptop is too heavy for the Alto. The laptop will not stay in position (it is meant to stay in a shallow rubber slot, but slides over the slot and rests against the keyboard).Another oddity -- I could not get my printer to work when plugged into one of the available USB slots in the Alto. Whne I plug the printer ditectly into my laptop it works. Go figure...this wouled be a great product for a lighter laptop and with minor revisions it could wrok with my Sony."
1,Not very good,"I could not believe that a company like Logitech designed this product. It is very thought less product.I got it for 20 bucks. It may be worth for what I paid but definitely not worth of MSRP.flaws:1. As every body mentioned you can not use front side ports (like audio, card readers) if your laptop have them in the front.2. You can not close your laptop lid3. There is lot of useless space both sides of the stand. This stand is occupying half of my table.4. You can not adjust the stand height5. You need to use Ac adapter if you want to use provided three usb ports. They worked only for pendrive not for the portable hard drive6. It has dedicated keys only for volume up, down, and mute. Keyboard is very big. Why not give dedicated keys for other multimedia operations?7. It has some hot keys for multimedia operations but you need to press function key first. There is no option to lock the function key.8. no customization of keys with softwaregood:1. looks nice"
4,Logitech Alto Notebook,"This is a wonderful product: easy to set up and works well with my 17"" laptop. HOWEVER, I only give it 4 stars as one MUST purchase an external mouse and wrist support. The positioning of the laptop on the notebook stand simply prohibits the functional usage of embedded touchpad. Additionally, the angle of the laptop on the stand necessitates the use of a wrist support.Those points not withstanding, the unit is light, structurally sound, and optimizes the use of the laptop keyboard. The Alto keyboard is exceptionally lively, far exceeding the touchability of the laptop; typing becomes so much easier! With Amazon's great price and delivery, this is a must buy for laptop owners. Just make sure a USB mouse and wrist support is also purchased."
2,Great if you want neck pain,"This product takes too much space and raises the notebook too high. the mechanism of holding the notebook is also rather flimsy. Its only use is as a USB hub and it is far too expensive for it. If you have so much space , it is simpler to get a normal USB keyboard for much less. The ideal solution is of course a docking station. Yet another innovative but overpriced and poorly designed logitech product."
1,Stay away from this Rube Goldberg rig,"I bought this keyboard from Amazon and I couldn't believe how badly it was designed. Quite out of character for Logitech I would say. Neither my son's HP notebook nor my Toshiba notebook would stay propped up on this Rube Goldberg rig. The stand blocked the front panel controls on the Toshiba and threatened to send the HP off onto the floor. Perhaps Amazon hopes to increase sales of replacement notebooks after this rig sends a bunch crashing off the table. BTW, I returned this product to Amazon and add insult to injury Amazon deducted return shipping from my refund. Not a good experience."
1,Not very valuable an item,"The stand makes the laptop sit up MUCH too high. I've tried it in two locations and wish I could return it.Logitech Alto Notebook Stand w/Integrated KeyboardIt simply doesn't work for me. I have an HP laptop stand that works much better, but is very expensive and I'd not recommend it either."
5,Excellent value for the price!,"I have two laptop computers and some keys on both of them, almost simultaneously, started ""sticking"" or not working at all. What to do?! I could either order and install new keyboards on both of the computers . . . or . . . I could consider Logitech's Alto Notebook stand with integrated keyboard. I chose the latter option because it was a lot easier than installing new keyboards and it was more affordable.The Logitech keyboard can be installed within minutes and works like a charm. Plus, it is a lot more comfortable and convenient typing on a full size keyboard than on the smaller laptop keyboard.I would STRONGLY recommend the Logitech Alto Notebook stand with integrated keyboard!Michael Garee"
5,Great product,Just what I was looking for. I need a number pad for my job and the full size keyboard works great.
4,Great product with one basic flaw.,"This product delivers all that you expect out of it. the keyboard is great, and the extra USB options really help out a lot. It also gives your notebook a good position so you don't have any neck pains.I had one basic issue with the Alto, that the USB ports don't get enough power supply to charge your devices like music players. For that you need to connect it to a power supply by an adaptor which has to be purchased. SO all in all I would recommend it, but want to tell you that you have to charge your ipod from your notebook USB."
5,Good Product,"Product works very well and is a pleasure to use. The AC power cord for the USB ports advertised was not avaliable at time of purchase. According to Logitech Tech Rep if the USB device has its own power source such as a printer, then the AC power cord is not needed. Logitech should inform buyers of this at time of purchase."
3,Not what I expected,I was expecting a guide and study on discerning the spirits whether they are of God or not. But this book is all about worship style within the church. This book would be good for a worship pastor or director.
1,WORST SERVICE EVER!,Do NOT order from this person. It Took longer than a MONTH for my item to get to the destination. I bought this for my mom for Christmas and when she received it she thought it had came for her b-day which is at the end of January. Not to mention it was shipped from China and they're known to have the most amount of bootlegs made in the world.HORRIBLE SERVICE!!
2,Disappointed reader,"This is not a slick production, but rather dowdy. The photographs are old and grainy, the paper is cheap and the print is a bit fuzzy. I was surprised the book was published in 1991, it had the feel of a 1950's publication. The contents also seem to be out-of-date. Much of the text reflected the authors conjectures, beliefs and favorite idioms. There was no significant research of the subjects. Much of the ""advice"" or ""how to"" were not explained, if any was even given. I was clearly disappointed and would never have purchased the book if I had an opportunity to first examine the book."
4,Where did the term doily comes from?,"This book is designed for serious collectors. However, for the rest of us it is downright fun to read about histories and purposes of linens and lace. The book is not designed to teach how to do it but you learn how it was done and can even recognize the various stitches.The book has fascinating pictures of equipment needed for the craft. Many are black and white, yet there is a color section. The down side is looking at the antique Skein Winder make mine look like it was made in the garage (o.k. it was made in the garage.)Some of the table of contents:A Brief History Of antique Linens, Lace, and NeedleworkAn Encyclopedia of StitchesNeedles, Threads, and PinsTypes of EmbroideryThe Variety of Darn WorkHopeful you stumbled on to this review as it is fun finding jewels like this book.

5,Wonderful,This is a great film. I happened to catch it when it aired on A&E and thought it so good I stayed up until 2 am every weeknight as to not miss any of it. Anyone who is a fan of romance or comedy will like this terrific film!
4,Pretty Entertaining,"The story has some suprising twists and turns, and the actors are great. Good bits of humor throughout and it even gets a little racy! It's an enjoyable watch, though it does get a little slow at times."
5,"Wonderful, wonderful movie!",I saw Tom Jones when it first aired on t.v. on A&E in April 1997. It was wonderful! I recomend it to anyone!
5,Great Fun!!!!!!!!!,"A&E is excellent when it comes to making mini-series, and Tom Jones is a prime example. The characters were very well cast and the screenplay was very well written. It was a joy to watch. I enjoyed every minute. Max Beesley was amazing as Tom and Samantha Morton did a wonderful job of portraying Sophie. There is nothing more to say other than, it was one of A&E's finest."
5,fun fun fun,"This version is a fun romp through the History of Tom Jones.I had to read this in high school and compare it to the original movie, both of which were delightful. I received this version as a gift and my husband and I both enjoyed it.To the few people who complain about the sex and themes - this is Tom Jones! What were you expecting? If you will not tolerate any such scenes in your house why on earth would you choose to watch Tom Jones? To put this into some sort of perspective, this is something I will allow my children to watch in their teens, once they are mature enough to understand the historical time and the literary themes and once they each have read the book -- probably at age 14-15+."
1,smutt,"I hated it. The acting costumes and all of that was good. But I knew nothing of the story so was shocked by the morals of this story. The reason I watched it was I saw Pride and Predgudace, done by the same people and exspected the same type of story."
5,Great CD. Great beat. Great artists.,This is a great Miami club style dance song. Puppet and Scotty Sixes are a great match. Recommend this CD to everyone.
2,Moderate stinging,"2 1/2While offering some distinct composition transitions to the classical arena, too much of YS gets lumped into that general haze of atonal intellectualism plaguing so much modern fare."
3,Bring back the Heritage Guides,"This new format is fine for browsing as part your trip planning. But it lacks the detail on art and culture that the old TCI Heritage Guides have; especially missed are the suggested walking tours. The new format does have more info on food, wine, shopping, etc than the old Heritage Guides, but it is not worth the tradeoff (at least for me.) As a result, Authentic Tuscany will stay on the shelf, while Heritage Guide to Umbria gets to come with."
2,Didn't hold my son's attention,"My son plays (or plays with) drums, guitar and piano. He loves banging on musical instruments. He is 5 years old. However, these did not hold his attention for 5 minutes. The sound is plastic sounding, not authentic at all. He never played with these things; we finally gave them away.Wade Young"
4,kids love them,"My 12 yr old daughter learned to play these at school. She taught cousins ages 7, 4, and 3 to play Jingle Bells for Christmas. They had lots of fun and we could even tell what they were playing."
5,Excellent for kids!,"This is an excellent musical instrument for kids ages 6 and up,Great for ensemble activities.I would recommend getting the treble extension for the sharps and flats notes and your kids can play a wider range of songs!"
5,Wonder,What a wonderful way to teach a class about sound and music. My children loved this prodruct.
2,Nothing special.,"I'm glad this wasn't my first experience with Emily Hendrickson, because if it had been I'd not have read any of her other works (and there are some I really enjoyed). The characters were likeable enough, but two-dimensional and under-developed at best. Julian is described as a ""scoundrel"" on nearly every page, but is never really characterized as such. Chloe's character is half relatively-intelligent-but-naive-maiden and half silly widgeon. The mystery they're ""solving"" together is sketched out in the broadest lines possible, and is only used as a backdrop to their inter-personal tension, which is eventually resolved, but only after pages and pages of trite and unnecessary angst. I rolled my eyes so many times while reading this book that I'm surprised they still see straight. Don't avoid Emily Hendrickson, but don't read this book if you have high regency standards."
4,It's the facial expressions,"I think the funniest thing about this movie isn't the dialog but the facial expressions the characters use while smoking. Bottom line, if you have the patience to watch a black and white movie and you are high also, this movie is top notch!"
2,Humorous,"Made in the 1930's, it appears to be made as an educational film about the dangers of smoking marijuana. As society's awareness and knowledge about drugs has grown since then, this movie would flop as an educational film. Today, the viewer should watch this film and enjoy, with humor, the silliness of it."
1,Boring doesn't begin to describe it,"I'm sorry, but this movie is boring beyond words. Dull dull dull dull dull. Nothing in it is the least bit funny. It's not even so over the top that it's funny. It's just boring. I wasted the money and 1 hour of my life on this thing; heed my warning and don't make the same mistake."
4,You never see money change hands,"This was intended to show the depravity of pot smokers and even worse, the evil pushers making money off these poor naive kids - but you never see any money change hands. What kind of idiot dealers are these people? That is just one of the glaring contortions in the movie and is one of the things that makes it the funniest flick till Ed Woods' Plan 9 From Outer Space. If you can get this for under $10.00 I highly reccomend it."
2,booooring,"... I watched this. I was bored. It's a stupid movie, but not in a good way. Also, not to be overlooked is the terrible quality of the picture and sound -- this is, after all, 50+ years old. Nothing redeeming about it, except the way it illustrates how long anti-drug, knee-jerk reactions have been a part of the popular consciousness."
2,"Reefer Madness was a commercial film,NOT a propaganda film","The only propaganda about the film Reefer Madness was pushed by the Marijuana lobby groups who used it for propaganda purposes.They falsely claimed that it was a Government commisioned film.In actual fact,it was simply a commercial exploitation film.Incidently,Marijuana has 70% more toxins and poisons in it than tobacco.Smoke it every day and look forward to a short life.As for the film? Don't buy it,for it is simply a B-grade film designed to make money."
1,Reefer Madness a film thats not worth it's hype,"I found reefer madness to be a ""DRAG"" of a movie it was explotive Boring and contained not one piece of storyline that was even mildly intresting whatsoever the actors were amateur the ending was like something you would expect to see in some kindergarden play put together in about five minutes. The only satifying point of the movie was the closing credites because you realize this piece of garbage is over. The plot is about as complicated as a roadrunner cartoon some kid's try marjuana get hooked on it kill a women ,run over a man with a car, get sent to jai,l go crazy and get put into an institution . If you enjoy boring pieces of garbage this movies for you... END"
2,A film that speaks for itself.,"The classic example of early t.v. propaganda. Interesting to watch and almost campy, this film shows the fear of drugs in the early part of the 1900's.-This opinion is of the author only. It does not necessarily reflect the views of the Ligonus International Media Corporation or its affiliates."
3,TEEN POT HEAD KILLS PARENTS WITH AXE!,"The perennial MIDNIGHT MOVIE. High-schoolers get mixed up with dope dealer who wants them all hooked for his own greedy purposes. Clever enough, he introduces them to Jazz, and before you know it, they're all smokin' an ounce a day, skipping thier school, and, yes, butchering thier parents. Rather sad this film WASN'T meant to be funny. Because it really is."
2,"""Reefer Blandness""","Apart from a few moments of high-camp delirium, ""Reefer Madness"" (1936) is rather dull exploitation fodder. Originally titled ""Tell Your Children,"" the anti-marijuana propaganda takes on a heavy-handed redundancy. Nevertheless, this midnight-movie landmark should be seen once. Extra Trivia: Edward LeSaint also played a judge in the Three Stooges two-reeler ""Disorder in the Court."""
4,a pretty funny propaganda flick,"what some people don't realize is that this movie was sponsered by the U.S. Treasury as a propaganda flim about the 'devil weed' marijuana. Its a very laughable example of the media blitz put out by the government in the 1920's and 30's to get people aginst marijuana. If you enjoy a good laugh, check it out. END"
1,GREAT movie! Horrible DVD.,"Please refer to the other reviews for plot synopses. I just want to comment on the DVD.WHAT a disappointment! Skips all over the place -- most often, it seems, during crucial dialog. Almost as if this movie was deliberately mangled. If you tried showing this flick to someone who had never seen it (the most fun way to watch it), you'd be spending half your time filling in the missing pieces for your bewildered friend.It's not as if the DVD manufacturer couldn't find a good print. I've seen it myself on TV at 100% better quality, with no skips and all dialog intact.SEE the movie! But beware the DVD."
2,'Reefer Madness' (Gotham Dist.) Running time: 67 minutes,"When I first saw this cheezy flick at a summer midnight madness film festival twenty-some years ago,I honestly thought it was a joke.I mean,the young people in this 1938 B/W film almost make Ward and June Cleaver look cool.1938,is this right?The Three Stooges were still new at that time.If parents truly wish for their off-spring to avoid blowing weed,they may not want to choose to show them this DVD.It's SO hard to take seriously.Thank goodness there aren't any 'extra features' here.I don't think I could've taken it.'Reefer...' does have a sole purpose,to watch maybe every two years after dark when there isn't any thing good on TV."
3,Did Anyone Buy This?,"Reefer Madness was a propoganda film against the use of marijuana, especially among teenagers. The story is a loose one about a group of kids who begin to party at a drug dealer's house and become hooked on the product. Instead of the usual symptoms like mild behavior and food cravings, these kids laugh like hyenas, engage in extreme sexual activities, and become very violent. One girl is even killed. Perhaps the film served as a warning in its time, but it is very laughable today. Not only are the kids stereotypical of perfect kids gone wrong, there are subliminal messages (4-20) and fake facts to back up the ridiculousness of the film.Included here is a colorized version of the original black and white film. It uses garish colors that make skin look like a very unnatural pink color and pastels for clothing. The world looks even stranger colorized, which adds to the hilarity.This movie is certainly a curiosity, but it is not much more than that."
3,Hit play and pass the pipe,"Now I know where my mother learned every thing she knows about the 'killer weed'. Watch it stoned or straight, keep this disk in your collection to pull out when friends are over. It's one big laugh."
4,Jealousy and possessiveness masquerading as love,Straightforward and melodramatic story of jealousy and possessiveness masquerading as love. Beautiful Technicolor cinematography of lovely people and places lends a hint of post card picture artifice to the whole endeavor. The sort of thing one might expect as an indie release these days but a rather startling - and startlingly successful - film from a major studio in the 40s.
5,Almost exactly but not quite like the book.,"This is one of the best of the early psycho-dramas. Jean Tierney is the ultimate in evil woman. Even more evil than Fatal Attraction because she so sweetly hides her jealousy and evil. She's even evil in her death.The movie follows the book very well, but leaves an ""episode"" or two out. I strongly suggest reading the book as well. The movie just gives you a taste of the character.And this is one of the few films out there where Vincent Price is not the bad guy. Well, he is sort of, but it's all her fault!"
2,Leave Her to the 1940s,"I was disappointed with Leave Her to Heaven after reading so many glowing reviews. It seemed too long, and it built far too slowly. Things didn't really get interesting until about an hour in.Here's the kicker though: Would Vincent Price's character really be allowed to the be prosecuting attorney in a case involving the murder of his ex-fiancee? Is that not a massive conflict of interest? Maybe in the 1940s that wasn't a problem, but it sure threw the film's sense of realism for a loop."
3,THIS WAS CORNEL WILDE'S MOVIE!,"I would have liked to have given this film four stars. I thought Gene Tierney was, as always, a wooden performer. (Olivia DeHavilland would have been dynamite in this role!) Jeanne Crain and the actress who played the mother were passable. The young actor who portrayed Cornel Wilde's crippled brother gave a stellar performance. Cornel Wilde, however, a very gifted and very underrated actor, walked away with the movie!"
3,SOAPY DRIVEL; BEAUTIFUL DVD,"""Leave Her to Heaven"" is pure soap. Stunningly photographed in technicolor the DVD is exceptional high quality. Not so the screenplay. Gene Tierney inexplicably won an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of a psychotic shrew who will stop at nothing to keep her husband from paying any attention to anyone but herself. Tierney is beautiful but the script does her in. Cornel Wilde is extremely wooden. Jeanne Crain is perfect for the part of Ruth (all sweetness and goodness). Vincent Price is his usual excellent self. The film is disappointing because the writer took the easy way out by having Tierney kill herself instead of having to live the rest of her life in misery paying for her sins. If you like Soap Opera this is the film for you. If you are manic depressive DO NOT watch this film."
2,Less Is More,"Tierney and Crain are great beauties who differ from the mean in opposite directions. Putting them together makes Tierney appear squat and neckless and Crain weak-chinned, pointy-nosed and gawky.The gorgeous color kept me from experiencing pity and fear.Speaking of Crain, where's ""Margie""?"
5,a great and unpredictable film,"This is an interesting fil, because it's always moving. it's very dramatic, and entertaining and it's a mystery and you get to guess what will happen next. Gene Tiereney is wonderful as a controlling woman who want al of her husband attention and affection at all times, and never out of her site. Jean Craine, makes a great supporting cart. Cornel Wilde is great in it has her husband."
5,PAGING STENDHAL'S Mademoiselle de la Mole...,"... anyone who has read Stendhal will recogize traits similar to those of the character portrayed by Ms.Tierney... as well as those of Lana Turner's character in ThePostmanAlwaysRingsTwice; for these reasons, this film remains a fascinating ""American"" cinematic version of a particular ""heroine"" proto-type of great literature of the preceeding century. Truly an iconic film to be savoured and valued, with a central figure created outside the standard character template so usually seen on the screen.The viewer must allow for this particular character-tradition and be willing to be swept-along into the baroque (sic) world of this film... a world dominated and willfully shaped by a ""heroine' who seems to be entirely demented, but in-fact, is (merely) a self-absorbed socio-path, determined to secure her own vision... even if she must kill herself to do so. Yes, it's all ""over-the-top' ... and it's meant to be so, without apology."
5,best Gene Tierney movie ever!,this movie is awesome. I have watched it weekly since I was 10 years old. The acting is awesome. Gene Tierney is the best in this movie.
5,Everyone knows someone just like her ....,"Really does not get the film noir credit it deserves (probably from its title with the uninformed film watcher expecting this to be a feature starring Dinah Shore or other 1940's musical starlet.) Some very satisfying twists of the old plot make this memorable and high on the repeat viewings scale. Gene Tierney is wonderfully mercurial - sometimes hot-hot-hot and other times just plain icy cold. This was her only Oscar nominated film and you can see why she was picked here. See Gene in this and in ""Laura"" and you will see two of the best 1944 leading actress film perfomances."
1,Lead her to Heaven,"The Movie in itself is fine the CD has an imperfection, about half way into the movie it stops and the actors are struggling to say their lines, its in the scene where he confronts her about her behavior once we get passed that scene the rest of the DVD works fine. I believe I would like another CD that is not damaged. The others I received are fine/ Please advise; Thank You. This movie is with Cornel Wilde."
4,Over-the-top romance in gorgeous technicolor,"Gene Tierney plays a possessive woman who snares a successful writer played by Cornel Wilde. Her obsessive love leads to murder.Unusually for its time, Leave Her to Heaven is (beautifully) shot in gorgeous technicolor. The set decoration and location shooting takes full advantage of the color photography.The film loses its grip a little bit during the stylised courtroom sequence which is totally over-the-top only to grab you again with a rousing finale.Excellent commentary included on the DVD by Time film reviewer Richard Shickel and Darryl Hickman who played the writer's disabled little brother Danny in the film."
4,Ignores the 435 years between 285 and 150,"Good book, covers most of the problems AFTER 150 AD.However it ignores all the time between 285 BC and 150 ADThere was more time between 285 and 150 then there was between 1611 (when the KJV was first released) and today. How different are today's English Bibles then the Original KJV?What differences where there in the Hebrew text of 285 BC and that of 150 AD? - Not covered in ANY book on the Septuagint (That I have seen)This book (like most others on the subject) assumes that the Greek version is the one that is wrong (With no PROOF that it was not the Hebrew Text that changed.) This is a good book."
3,Historic film news archive,"Despite less than perfect quality, this collection of 1950s-era film news clips about the Korean War is ideal for those interested in scenes of the war not often depicted in more recent documentaries. Worth the price."
2,"should have ""Forgot"" this dvd","not the documentary i was expecting. it's the same title, but not the same films. pretty much a military propaganda film. very repetitive..."
2,Not What I Thought It Was Going To Be,Primarily a series of old newsreels. Did not provide an accurate chronological depiction of the war.
1,Korea The Forgotten War,"This is the worst documentary DVD I have ever purchased and I have many. I wanted to learn as much as I could on the Korean Conflict and all I got was this... This is a U.S. propaganda film and nothing more. It is more about the people (from the US point of view which is slanted at the least) and NOTHING on the war, the strategy and the why. I tried to return it to Amazon but could not due to time of purchase. I wish I could get my money back!"
2,A study in propaganda of the 1950's,"I served in Korea shortly after the ""cease fire"", and purchased this DVD for its historical content. I was disappointed to find that it tuned out to be a collection of ""Big Picture"" propaganda films of the 50's era, and sadly lacking in history of the ""conflict"" outside of sketchy descriptions of the progress of the war. It might better serve as a study of propaganda as it existed during that period, but its usefulness ends there.This should not be confused with another CD collection with a virtually identical title: ""Korea: The Forgotten War 1950 - 1953"", and subtitled ""The true story of a brutal and bloody war."" This I found to be a factual presentation of events, well organized and tastefully done - if war can be described in those terms. There are in excess of 25 titles on Amazon combining the words ""Korea"" and ""forgotten"" so buyer beware."
2,Yuck.,"As far as Barbie toys go (and believe me we have lots -- I have twin girls!) this one is AWFUL. Barbie has a SOLID hard tail and the only thing the girls play with is the shell and the baby Krissy stuff. Barbie is pretty, but the play value is limited.Too much $$ for not enough play."
3,"Short-lived, but hey, it's pretty...","~*~Bought 3 of these sets, each person they were bestowed upon immediately made oooohh and aaaahh noises, mostly the adults - then the tub test arrived - it almost failed, however, it does light up, but - do not allow any roughness ""Careful with this dolly, honey"" - umm...right. The dolls that have legs and numerous moving parts score more points.And the whole ""baby"" thing really confuses kids who want to believe it came from the womb of beloved barbie...Apparently ""krissy"" is ANOTHER ""sister"" from the girls' ever-fruitful Mom.(...) Great fairy-tale fun, cute deal from the outlet rack - would probably buy it again to hear the fawning.~*~"
3,Not worth the asking price,Wait for this one to go on sale. It's certainly not worth the asking price. My daughter is a big mermaid and Barbie fan and I thought this would be the perfect birthday gift. After spending 20 minutes getting Barbie and Krissy out of the box (Mattel really needs to work on this aspect of its packaging) we loaded everyone and everything up with batteries. The shell works intermittently. Barbie worked once. We changed batteries. Barbie doesn't work at all now. My daughter still plays with this toy--it feeds her imagination and that at least compensates for the money wasted. But I really have to question Mattel's ability to create toys (at least Barbie items) that work and last--I for one will think twice before making another Barbie product purchase.
3,Perfect? No but still enjoyed,"My daughter (6)was allowed to pick one new Barbie for her birthday. She pick Mermaid Barbie. Getting it out of the package took 20 minutes. Still all in all she loves the thing. No it can't do much, you can't dress her or she can't walk or stand or sit well, but my daughters imagination overcame all that. Will it be the most played with? I doubt it. But it does make her happy and isn't that what it is all about? I am not sorry for this purchase it may not educate in the usual sense, but it does stimulate imagination. A nice addition to our Barbie collection...."
3,A waste of money unless it is on sale,"My daughter only took this in the bath twice with her and the beautiful blue sticker along the front of her tail is already starting to peel off. you would think that at least they would have made the plastic under the sticker blue, knowing that this would happen when it got wet, but no. It is very plain and it looks really bad. She was crushed taht I could not make it stay stuck. As for fun, she likes it,...."
2,JUNK,"Barbie Mermaid & Krissy are very pretty, but my daughter took in the tub only a total of three times and Barbie would nolonger work. The whole purpose of Barbie Mermaid is the go in the water and light up...WRONG. Mattel really needs to take a better look at the quality of their products and also package them differently. It took me about 30 minutes to just be able to untie and untangle Barbie & Krissy to get them out of the box. There is absolutely no reason for them to package so severly. I recommend DO NOT BUY if you have a child that will be playing with---this Barbie will not last!"
4,Magical Mermaid Barber hard to get out of,"It took me ten minutes to get this doll out of the package, no child could do it without damaging the doll. The doll is overpriced. The reason the doll's battery chamber is not waterproof is obvious. Mattel used cheap plastic liners instead of rubber. How lame. And after paying ..., the least they could have done was insured that a mermaid with batteries was waterproof. ...Frank"
2,truly disappointed,after several minutes of trying to get her out of the packaging my daughter played with her in the tub right away she got her wet she did glow then she asked what else does she do? Nothing you can't even dress her. So not worth it if the makers took half the time to play with her as they took to pakage her they would have known .
3,"OK, if bought one at a time","I downloaded a single edition and actually liked the text-based format -- and the cartoon drawings were included. But the Kindle edition has many fewer articles than the online edition I've been reading for a number of years now. So I will not be subscribing,but rather downloading a single issue from time to time when I won't be able to access the online version for most of the day. Nice to know it's there, but definitely not worth $15 to me."
3,No drawings and pictures in Le Monde anymore??,"During several weeks, Le Monde had drawings (Plantu, Les Indégivrables) as well as photos. They no longer appear. What a pity! Please correct that annoying problem! Thanks."
1,+/- $180 for yearly subscribtion?!,i love le monde. there's just no way i'll pay more for the digital version than a frenchman would for the paper edition delivered to his front door. that's just ludicrous pricing.
1,"Great idea, poor execution",Being able to get foreign language newspapers delivered to your Kindle is a great idea. Charging such a premium for the service is a poor plan by Amazon.
3,Why Le Monde?,Why carry only the pretentious pseudo-newspaper Le Monde. Why not a real quotidien like Le Figaro?
2,it's just so dry without the photos!,"I was thrilled to be able to get Le Monde - we live in a small Alpine village miles from anywhere - but after trying out the Kindle edition for ten days, I've abandoned it because I miss the photos, maps and graphs and can't even check out the T.V. programmes. If one day in the future, these are available on my Kindle, I'll definitely subscribe."
1,Robery price,"It is a robery to buy an electronic newspaper that doesn't has images or even his full content for such a prize. If you get Calibre you can syncronize the newspaper for free, including some pictures or even buy the physical journal for less money. Besides being an ecological solution I believe amazon needs to work out its prices for the incomplete product that is being delivered."
2,Overpriced,"Le Monde Kindle Edition is a great newspaper, rich and informative.Unfortunately it is way overpriced at 28$ - especially when the online version, which includes a downloadable PDF is at 6."
4,Fabulous!,"Le Monde is one reason I think the Kindle is such an ingenious device. Whenever I get the urge to read the day's edition of Le Monde, I can order it with my Kindle and, voila!, there it is, in under a minute. I don't know any store in my immediate area I could drive to for purchasing Le Monde, and I'm not a fan of reading newspapers online. Since I don't read the paper every day, I only purchase when I'm in the mood; the subscription is a bit pricey if you don't intend to read it most days, but the daily editions are amazingly inexpensive, and Le Monde always has interesting content. Thank you Amazon!Now if only the Kindle store offered a decent French-English dictionary."
5,"It's French, and it's informative",I keep up my reading ability in french and like the news it presents. Such a wonderful paper. Will definitely order again.
1,"Absurd, shameful pricing","The price is more than double what Le Monde itself asks for its digital editions. The image of Amazon's brand will actually deteriorate because of such pricing policy. The sooner they understand it, the better. In the meantime, I won't pay that much."
4,high caliber journalism,Excellent analysis of national and interntl affairs mixed with critical viewpoints based on a centrist political position.sports are not covered much.
3,"Le MOnde, a French langauge publication edited in Paris","Le Monde I appreciate opportunity to read a French publication not readily available nearby, will probably seek other overseas periodicals."
3,More content than on the Web page...,"I find that articles are more in depth in this version than the Web espcially regarding books and lifestyle, analysis and French Politics. The formatting looks a little bizarre at times - it seems that the creator doesn't look at this version on a Kindle. The price is a little high but it is a daily issue so it doesn't amount to very much per day. My personal problem is that I never find time to read that much content every day on top of everything else."
1,Set-up to fail ?,"The absence of pictures and graphical content from newspapers and magazines delivered outside the US will fundamentally challenge the penetration of the Kindle world wide. Speed is key, and absence of pics or graphs will slow adoption by making subscription prices prohibitive and product irrelevant for most. It is an invitation to Tablet pc makers to jump in and capture the market with more expensive devices that provide bells and whistles of marginal importance to the book, newspaper and magazine clientèle."
2,Difficult to understand the high price,"It's difficult to understand why you would pay 40% more for the kindle subscription than for the website subscription which includes the full content on your ipad. It gets completely impossible to understand when you know that there are free software (calibre) you can use to get a kindle edition from the website (with or without subscription). There is also some web based services like webtoread.com which also provide Le Monde delivered to your Kindle daily, and that's free."
1,Cher et qualité à revoir !,"Je ne comprends pas comment est ce que Le Monde pourrait convaincre les lecteurs avec une qualité aussi médiocre.Pourtant, la navigation est intéressante, la lecture et agréable, mais le prix et la qualité des images sont horribles ...Copie à revoir !! On y est presque ..."
2,Too dry without pictures,"The international delivery doesn't include picture, chart, or photo... Makes it kind of dry to read."
1,Details make the difference,however there is now way I buy a journal or magazine without images!I'd love to buy Kindle but content is key. As of Today it's English only (remember iTunes explosion when they opened up to other countries with localized content?). French journal are overpriced and only a few of them are available. 3G bandwidth is that expensive?
5,A must for every dog-owner's library!,"An excellent analysis of problem dog behaviors and training methods for overcoming them, aimed toward younger dogs but appropriate for all ages. The author correlates breed type and original function with the particular sorts of mischief the dog may get into, and explains what to do to redirect the dog's energy and attention into positive activities. Especially helpful for first-time dog owners."
4,"If you have a teenage dog, get this book","This is an excellent book that discourages treat training and encourages understanding and praise. It covers the differences between puppies and adolescents, winning your dog's respect, having an appropriate relationship with your dog, tools you do and don't need, understanding how breed and character affects behavior, trade secrets, how to train basic commands, rules for rehabbing a problem dog, dealing with problems, and how to 'build' the dog of your dreams. Behaviors covered range from aggression to grooming problems to wildness. Although it is geared for the adolescent dog, this book would also be suitable for someone adopting a dog or just needing to retrain his or her own difficult pet."
4,Great book for understanding your dog,"Wonderful well written easy to read book. I found it very insightfull and full of great advice. I do not agree with the use of a slip collar and the jerk method, as I prefer to use a prong collar. The rest of the book was very helpful in correcting my adolescent dogs problems"
2,"wrong book, not in shape as described....","The book was the wrong edition. It also was definitely not in --like new-- condition.was somewhat tattered at the edges, and a lot of scratch marks on the cover. The thing that bugs me the most is that it is not the edition that I paid for...."
4,Sherlock and the Nazis,"The style is lively and fast paced, yet full of the detail Holmes' fans love. The writer's foreshadowing is valid and adds to the fun of guessing the plot twist. As with many mysteries, the ending is too compressed, and several interesting problems are merely presented as solved. I found the use of German without accompaning translations to be affected. Still all in all, i'd gladly read another Holmes' novel by Mr. North."
1,A Horrible Horror.,"It sounded interesting, and the idea was novel, but I felt the title and cover misrepresented the book. The story worked on a basic level and the scientific details very informative, but the author went overboard in his vividly gruesome descriptions of death and dismemberment. I quickly grew tired of the macarble detail and found I could skip paragraphs at at time and stil keep track of the plotline. However, my real problem with this book were the one dimensional characters and the unrealistic interactions b/t the Marine characters. I really hate when authors write about the military withoutconsulting someone who served. The interactions b/t the Gunnery Sgt and his subordinates did not realistically reflect the Corps, and the Captain calling the Gunny, ""sergeant"", would not happen in the Marine Corps. To make matter worse, the author seems to confuse Marines w/ (Army) Soldiers, which is tantamount to heresy. All and all the strong premise of the book melted half way through."
1,My cat is ill because of it,My 2 year old Cindy has developed an allergic reaction to a new bag of this Purina cat chow indoor formula food. She has been throwing up all over the rugs and floors when she used to be so careful about cleanliness! I am starting to suspect quality control. I will never buy this product again.
5,My Cat Prefers this Purina Indoor Formula,"When my cat was a kitten, he ate the Purina Kitten Chow until he was full-grown. At that point, I got him the blue bag of regular Purina Cat Chow, and this green bag of Indoor Formula Cat Chow, and offered him a choice. My cat is an indoor-outdoor cat, but not too active with medium-length hair--he looks a bit like he is part Selkirk Rex. Well, he chose this green bag formula! My cat won't eat any canned cat food or meat, but he loves this cat chow, and he also likes cheese and milk. To vary his diet, I sometimes moisten this dry food with a bit of water and add a pinch of Brewer's Yeast flakes. I also use goat cheese and goat milk for treats. (I also give him a bit of Hairball remedy now and then, sometimes he eats that, and other times I have to put it on his paw so he will lick it off. I met two other ladies while shopping who say their cats prefer this Purina Indoor Formula Cat Chow.)"
3,"Not bad, if you can stand the smell!","I grabbed a bag of this when it went on sale at the local market and, although one of my cats really likes it, I can't stand the smell! Honestly, it smells like horse doo. Whenever she jumps in my lap after eating this stuff, it about makes me gag! It has to be the strangest smelling cat food I've ever used, which is why I wanted to write this review. Just thought it was rather strange. I don't plan on buying it again because of that - the smell is Blech! It isn't her favorite food, but it's tolerable, especially if mixed with a little meat. The protein content isn't as high, only 30% because it's for the indoor cat. I would recommend it for that reason because it does help with the weight factor. Just be careful,your nose will have to be made of steel to get past the smell!"
5,"quintessential Singh, illuminating, entertaining","Simon Singh is really a treasure, a gifted mind who can take the obtuse and complex and illuminate in understandable terms and in an engaging manner. I loved The Code Book for its translation of the babble of cryptography into easy to understand terms, and the author's ability to set a discipline into its human and historical environment. Simon is one of the finest scientific 'popularizers' around."
3,Off To A Slow Start...,"""I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry"" gets off to a really slow start and I didn't laugh very much at all during the first half of the movie. I think it started to become a different movie about halfway through. It seemed like a Paint By Numbers script, but once the characters warmed up they delivered the lines with some emotion. I only laughed out loud one time, so obviously it wasn't that funny. If anything, this movie is pro-homosexuality and it shows how ignorant people can be over something that doesn't even affect them personally. The movie starts out without a clue, but by the end it manages some charm."
3,First part was good,The first part of this movie lived up to what I was expecting. It was fun and funny. The second part was a totally different movie! This part lost MOST of the fun and funniness and tried to be WAY to preachy. Really wish it would have stayed with the way it was going in the beginning.
1,Double Vision,"We also had trouble viewing this rental. We downloaded it to our Tivo and it came out blurry. Anytime there was action in the film, it was hard to watch."
1,What A Flop !,"Adam Sandler can be hit or miss with his movies - this one is worse tham ""miss"" - it is dire ! Quite obviously made by macho lesbian loving , football playing , beer guzzling men who have'nt the faintest idea what the word comedy actually means - NOT FUNNY - Just crass ! If you have 90 minutes of your life to waste - get this one !! See if you can find an intelligable storyline or a funny line ."
5,Very funny and a great cast,"This movie is hilarious. Kevin and Adam compliment each other very well. I also thought Jessica Biel was very good too. Of course, it doesn't hurt that she is very easy on the eyes.I though the plot was very good and the acting was well executed. I found myself laughing outloud numerous times thru the entire movie. The bluray quality was better than the dvd and the colors were very bright and crisp. I was so excited when they released this to bluray because I wanted it for my collection.Get this movie, you will happy with your purchase."
1,Stupid Homophobic Sohomoric,This movie was stupid (it had Adam Sandler in it so what do you expect). It was sophomoric (it had Adam Sandler in it so what do you expect) and homophobic. The best part is getting to see Jessic Biels butt.
1,Stupid and boring,A stupid movie with a dumb story line. Obviously made with an agenda rather than to be funny. Enough of Adam Sandler already and Kevin James has never been funny.
4,too funny,"I expected to be less then impressed with this movie, but it actually cracked me up the whole time...There were parts that were kind of slow going for me, but over all, it was pretty funny and I'd definitely add it to my movie collection."
3,I now Pronounce you Chuck & Larry.,"Funny movie but with an Agenda. It's pretty obvious what type of bias a hollywood movie would have.it's disappointing that Adam Sandler would be in this movie.Still thought it was funny despite it's liberal view on ""acceptance."""
3,A bit disappointing,I guess my expectations were a bit higher for these comic leaders and the potential this film had. It was still good and worth watching. Dan Aykroyd was the only actor that could pull off the scenes he did as the Captain. I had to back up those scenes a couple of times since they were just too funny. Jessica Biel did a great job of adding a strong female presence.
2,Not that great,"This movie made me really happy to have Amazon Unbox for my Tivo. I didn't buy the movie (yay!) and I didn't have to return it (even better) after renting it.I just didn't care for this one. I usually like Adam Sandler, but this movie just didn't make me laugh. It mostly annoyed me. Oh, sure, by the end Chuck and Larry have learned some Very Important Lessons in life (of course) but that didn't make me feel any better about the movie.I guess it's ok for an afternoon where you're snowed in or otherwise really bored at home."
3,Kinda Disappointed In My Two Favorite Comedians,"Being a big fan of both Sandler and James, it hurts to rate the film so low. I was really expecting a lot from two of my favorite modern comedians, but there just wasn't much in the story to be really funny. James and Sandler have both done seperate movies and TV shows that are funnier than this. Don't get me wrong, it is ok, but more like a giggle here and there instead of a full on belly laugh the entire film. I can't even think of a scene that was my favorite, which is another problem, it's not that memorable. Overall, it is worth watching but not worth buying."
1,Movie is blurry--DO NOT RENT!!,"As stated in another review before, this movie is extremely blurry during any action parts for some reason. I tried it against the reviewers advice and it almost made me sick in the first 5 minutes! A refund was promptly given by Amazon but trust me--Do not waste your time here. I have watched many movies before with no problems, this one has a problem in the source code though."
3,"Decent movie, horrible blurry download",The movie was decent but almost unwatchable on my Tivo. I've rented other movies from Amazon and they were fine but this one gave me a headache. I should have listened to a previous reviewers comments that this movie download was blurry but I thought how bad could it be. So bad that I don't think I'm ever going to use Unbox ever again.
4,Crude and funny - normalizes gay humor,"Not too many movies have done well when centering the film around the topic of homosexuality. Adam Sandler and Kevin James both complement each other very well in this movie. The plot is ridiculous, Adam Sandler's womanizer lifestyle is a sideshow, and there are many laugh out loud gay jokes. Though some of the gay jokes were bland and made me roll my eyes, this movie was very entertaining.Jessica Biel is also drop-down gorgeous and is enough reason to take a look at this movie.You'll see some of the many popular themes like teamwork, resilience, parenthood, and some tradebook crude Adam Sandler jokes in the mix."
3,"Chuck, Larry, and Jessica Biel's Body","Adam Sandler and Kevin James star as heterosexual New York City firefighters Chuck and Larry who are forced into a domestic partnership, so that Larry can keep getting his benefits to help support his two children after his wife passes away. When a noisy city investigator threatens to expose their charade to the entire world, Chuck calls in a lawyer named Alex (Jessica Biel) to defend their partnership in front of the city council. The situation turns when Chuck (Adam Sandler.) falls for Alex, but can't tell her his feelings because Larry (Kevin James) will lose the case and his benefits leading to some awkward semi-funny situations. If your a fan of Adam Sandler and Kevin James comedy and/or seeing Jessica Biel's body, this movie is for you, if your looking for a serious movie though, take a pass."
3,seen it before,"If you've seen *Strange Bedfellows*, starring Paul Hogan and Michael Caton, then *Chuck & Larry* is deja vu for you.Larry (James) is a widower with 2 kids. Since he was too busy grieving over his wife and working, he missed the deadline to switch the primary beneficiary from his deceased wife to his children. Since there are no current woman in his life, Larry decided that his best option is to do a same-sex marriage.Larry pulled this off by guilt-tripping his best pal and co-worker, Chuck (Sandler) into this gay marriage scam. Of course, the insurance company want to make sure that everything is legit and sent out an investigator. So, Chuck moved into Larry's place and both play the gay life.To make things worse, the media picked up on Chuck & Larry's life. Now, they can't back out of it. Their co-workers have treated them differently, etc.Again, *Strange Bedfellows* deja vu.Funny but not lap-slapping funny. Just alright."
1,Few laughs. Poorly done film.,"I enjoy good comedies that make me laugh and forget the stresses of day to day life. This film, unfortunately, did not do that often. The jokes were strained and the writing tried too hard to get a laugh, mostly unsuccessfully. Furthermore, the camera work and editing were substandard--I expected better production value from an Adam Sandler vehicle.This film gave me the impression that somebody came up with a funny premise and then rushed it to the screen. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Another crass film to change a culture,This movie has been viewed as a way to approach homosexuality and marriage. Please prayerfully consider not watching this film.
5,love it,Adam Sandler is great. I love this product. I would recommend it to you.I'm an Adam Sandler fan. Not for kids
4,Good movie!,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I started watching this movie- stupid gay jokes? Over the top guy on guy humor? But I was pleasantly surprised! It's a really good movie, it came from a different angle than your run of the mill, 2 straight guys having to pretend to be gay movie. I'd recommend it!"
3,Not again!,"It seems like all of Adam Sandler's movies have the same theme, plot and actors. Frankly I am over it, but I thought just maybe this one would be different. If you are are expecting to be blown away and laughing hysterically you won't be. If you have seen Adam's other movies you will be able to predict what happens."
1,Could've been a great movie,"disappointing, could've been a really funny movie! There was just something missing, either chemistry between the two actors or timing. The preview was better then the movie!"
2,Definitely One of Adam Sandler's Misses,"Adam Sandler certainly has had some hit movies- but this is not one of them. This particular film is seriously missing something...I think overall it's just the chemistry of James and Sandler. They don't work well together; they're better off never working together again.I rented this out for the plot did sound funny enough, and the trailer for the movie sure made it look entertaining. But trailers can really fool you sometimes that's all. I hardly laughed throughout the entire movie, and most of the time I was looking at the clock, eager for the film to finally wrap itself up. It does grow boring and the jokes are not close to being memorable or side- splitting.Not to mention Sandler's character is just annoying from beginning to end. All this together makes this a rather lousy movie. Another Sandler miss to add to the list.2/5"
3,Not That Funny,"I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. The previews made it seem like it would be hilarious but as can often be the case these are the funniest parts in the movie. There is very little left to laugh at. Overall, the movie is ok but I would recommend renting not buying."
2,More Adam Sandler,"Adam Sandler has a reputation among the Hollywood types as the nicest guy in Hollywood. I believe it is because every movie he makes consists of him and his ""buddies"" horsing around for couple hours without any real plot or reason.This makes for mild entertainment for a little while, but soon you will be wishing for it all to end.The one saving grace in this movie is Jessica Biel, who doesn't do any great acting but looks fantastic."
5,Funny,This has got to be the funniest movie I have seen in a long time. Adam Sandler and Kevin James were funny but Vhing Rhames had me in stitches. A must see.
3,Average Comedy,This movie falls far short of Sandler's recent film Click in both comedy and overall story. Some parts were actually so ridiculous that I felt myself cringing. Several of the actors seem miscast (Steve Busemi as an attorney attacking Sandler and James as being insurance frauds and Dan Ackroyd as the Fire Captain). Rob Schneider looked ridiculous as a minister marrying them.Sandler's relationship with Jennifer Biels fall far short of Matthew Perry's relationship with Neve Campbell in a much superior movie call Three to Tango.
4,"King of ""Queens"" indeed.","Kevin James is a widower that talks his playboy friend Adam Sandler into pretending to be his life partner so that he can keep his benefits at work. The insurance company suspects fraud and they send an investigator to get to the bottom of things, excuse the poor choice of words. it's not a bad flick but the chemistry wasn't quite right between Sandler and James. Still a good enough movie to check out."
4,Need a laugh?,"Adams Sandler and Kevin James rarely disappoint. Every now and again, I just NEED A LAUGH, and his SILLY HUMOR does the trick. I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry fits the bill."
1,chips edges,This blade chips tile edges on the first cut! My edge looks like I used my teeth to cut through it. I had much better luck with the Husky for the same price. Got perfect cuts with that blade for awhile.
3,helpfull,this product i use a lot here in suriname so i'm used to the product de quality stays the same and i hope it stays that way or get better for the same price
4,"nice hat, bad size","This is a well made hat, but Dorfman Pacific describes the X/XL as accomodating a size 7 5/8 head. No way! Skip this if you normally wear a XL. Consider the X/XL size as only an X. If you don't have a big head, this is a good hat, appears durable. Bought this from Gravity Trading Co. through Amazon, and Gravity was fantastic about taking it back and refunding not only the total price but also shipping and providing a prepaid label to return it, put through the credit the same day they received the hat back!"
5,Love love these toys!,"I love all of the Lamaze toys because my son would play with them when he was really young (3 - 4 monts). Although he likes the puppy dog one best, this is a close second."
3,Better suited for an older baby,"Tucker certainly is a cute toy with what I thought was sure to include a lot of appeal for my daughter but she's never shown much interest in him. Perhaps his shapes, hidden textures and mirror are better suited for a slightly older baby who is past the 'bang on anything and everything' phase; maybe 12+ months. I am looking forward to reintroducing Tucker to her once she is crawling around. I believe Tucker will be a friendly educational/discovery toy once my daughter is more interested. That's not to say that he couldn't hold more comforting possibilities instead of just being educational. To each baby his or her own!"
5,You must definitely buy this book!,"As an RF engineer, involved in Wireless Network Design and Implementation, I found this book the most resourceful in my personal library. It is a perfect blend of all Wireless Technologies, Cellular, Wireless and also IP. What I appreciated most was that the book covered all my needs. If you need to know antenna theory and digital modulation techniques, on top of Wireless technologies, you need not spend time and money on other texts. The contents of this book will no doubt be helpful to everyone, from graduates and engineers to academics. I personally congratulate the authors for the great job!"
5,A great book for perceiving Miro,I am enjoying this book as my best. I bough it as a reminder of Miro's work and found an outstanding journey to his house Calamajor and visits to his workshop by a very sensitive author. The quality of the book is excellent (as all Taschen's). Most of the pictures are accompanied by some stories that help to understand the artworks. Excellent price for this beautiful art-book.
3,nice vocal but missing something,I did not like the mixes of this track. The vocal was clublike and the artists picture is cute.
5,Love this hat!,"I have tried a lot of hats. My 2 year old daughter hates wearing them. I was doubtful this one would be different. But she loved the pink color the moment I showed it to her. I think maybe the material makes it more comfortable on her head too, so she is less apt to take it off. And it's so great that it has sun protection!"
5,Nice variety of ab workouts on one DVD!,"I absolutely LOVE this DVD! For the most part I work out with a lot of Chris Freytag DVD's but I've been adding 1 to 2 of the Best Belly Blasters workouts along with my regular workouts. I like the variety of workouts to trim and tone the belly that this DVD has to offer. The only one I'm not crazy about is the dancers' section, but that's because I have 2 left feet!"
5,Adorable,"These are the cutest things ever! When lit they are a real hoot. If you love your Airstream, you're going to want a set of these."
4,Light set received as advertised,This item was for a gift-it was received in a timely manner and was as described.
4,very interesting take on vampires,"I liked it.It definitely was not the best vampire movie out there but it was very unique. It had some new elements of vampire mythology. I wish we had some fang action compared to the necklace weapon.It was a bit dated...very 1980's like themes and visuals. The acting was good. Catherine Deneuve was perfect for the role. Icy, beautiful, and a tragic character. Bowie was not bad for the role. A young vampire worried about retaining his youth.Seeing a young, very attractive Susan Sarandon was a kick. Some of the love scenes were nice and appropriate for a vampire movie. Vampires, blood, and sex. What more could you want?Not five stars due to some slow pacing that just dragged at times throughout the movie. Like a previous critic noted...I was just waiting for Bonnie Tyler to come out singing ""A Total Eclipse of the Heart"" in the MTV music sets.A good solid movie for an evening view. Tight 91 minutes run time too."
4,Horror With Class,"David Bowie plays the husband of a women who has been around since the Pharoahs. She has to feed. When she married Bowie she told him it would be ""forever and ever"", and so far it has. But now he is seeing himself age at a rapid pace and knows now that it wouldn't really last forever. Even now, when he feeds, it doesn't stop or even slow down the aging process. Bowie's worst problem is that he can't die, only age. Susan Sarandon is in this movie. If you see the show all will be ""revealed""."
5,Scott made an good film out of Strieber's book.,"This has to bee one of the best vampire movies i have seen. Mote fans call it a ""Erotic Lesbian Film"", it's more of a ""Gothic love story with a MTV look"". At 100 MINS it gaves characters something to do and Deneuve and Sarandon's sex scene is tamer then the things they have on TV and movies today. Good film get it. Lets hope they gave us a good DVD version.Note: Rated R for some bloody horror violence, language and bref strong sexuality/nudity and for some disturbing general tone."
5,A gory but good movie.,"Miriam (Catherine Deneuve) and John (David Bowie)are 2 bloodthirsty immortals who live a good life in the human city of New York. She keeps her ageing lovers in the attic and John has some how become ill after 3000 years. Miriam now must find a new love who well never age. She finds it in Sarah Roberts(Susan Sarandon), who's geriatrics research may hold the secret to immortality.Indeed this was a good movie with a MTV look emphasizing style over story and became one of the big cult films of the 80s (there were a lot at the time). The well used story is spun out at a good moving pace complete with tame love scenes between Deneuve and Sarandon, and a little mix of sly humor that does not work well with the film. Any one who is in the mood for something dark and gothic stood get this film. I hope MGM well put it on DVD soon.1983. 100 MINS. Horror.Rated R (for Brief Strong Vampire Violence, Language and for some Sexuality/Nudity)."
5,The best modern-day vampire movie I've ever seen!,"Catherine Denevue is absolutely elegant and mysterious in this movie. It gives us a rather different look into the nature of Vampires by deferring away from the stake through the heart, holy water, garlic, etc. kind of image that most vampire movies display. Not to mention the movie has a very erotic seen between Sarandon and Denevue which I thought to be shockingly intriguing! This movie doesn't have alot of blood and gore as one might expect from a Vampire movie but it was nonetheless absolutely chilling! If you want to see a tastefully done and creepy modern day vampire movie, you must see, 'The Hunger'!"
2,You call THIS a horror film? No way!!!,"Silly, overdrawn plot about vampires who just didn't come prepared. David Bowie was OK, I guess, but this movie just wasn't scary! Period! On the positive side, when Catherine Deneuve puts the moves on Susan Sarandon, I suddenly found myself paying attention! That was sexy! But why the hot girl-girl seduction scene in what's supposed to be a scary movie? It just doesn't make sense."
1,not one of David Bowies best movies to date,"I'm a huge Bowie fan, but I have to say that this movie did not feature his best performace. The only good part of The Hunger was the first ten minutes or so, after the shower scene with Denuve. Then the movie gets pretty boring, and Bowie ages rapidly and dies. so unless you want to think of Bowie as a dead Bowie, I suggest you save your money and not buy this movie. END"
1,What a waste....,"Wonderful actresses:Sarandon and Deneuve .Both in 1983 on Top of the World. And as result a sleazy ,poorly cut story, played mostly in the dark with curtains flowing? What a waste of celluloid ."
1,Worse vampire movie ever,"This movie is horrible. I will never get back the 2 hours of my life. I love Bowie, but this movie was soooo boring and just bad all around."
1,Why? Why do you people sell this trash?,"How can people actually like this movie??? It was utter trash! It was great at the beginning, but then it totally degenerated into a confused bunch of lesbian-sex driven dribble. Ugh! David Bowie and Susan Sarandon do a wonderful job of acting, but not even that can save the confusing and weak plot and poor writing."
3,Not What I Expected,"Didn't watch very much of the movie. It was real slow taking off and I just couldn't wait for something exciting to happen. Love David Bowie music, but this really didn't grab me."
3,Defective DVD Good movie,"Original vampire tale with excellent performances by David Bowie and Susan Sarandon. Beware of lesbian sex scene or ""hey"" lesbian sex scene if you're interested. Just um don't let the kiddies watch it. ;)"
2,Disturbing,"Curious to see this movie, Susan Sarandon at the start of her career. Story dark and disturbing. Quality of film and sound is very poor. So glad we have come so far in movies."
3,"Interesting, but needed more work","This movie had a really interesting premise: A vampire woman who takes mortal lovers and makes them vampires, but, sadly, they eventually grow old, forcing her to seek out another.With some rewrites to the script and better directing this film could have been great. Unfortunately, the story is thin and full of questions and the ending left much to be desired. HOWEVER, the subject was interesting enough of a twist on the vampire myth that I would still suggest any vampire fan check it out. Maybe not buy it, but rent it or borrow it."
5,great movie,i don't use to like tony scott's films but this one really caught me. it's a classic. i never felt so mesmerized by a horror movie like this since kubrick's the shining. please pay atention to this movie.
4,Plotless and beautiful,"This film is more concerned with lighting cigarettes than with developing it's own plot, but it is so equisitely filmed that it simply doesn't matter. ""The Hunger"" abandons traditonal narrative to paint a surreal and gorgeous portrait of the life of a vampire, and of the people she draws into her world. Each shot is so carefully composed that they could be paintings unto themselves, and the soundtrack is perfectly haunting. The plotlessness does leave a little to be desired in the end, but somehow ""The Hunger"" gets away with leaving its loose ends untied."
2,Hunger for More,"This film started off very well then just dropped off and went staight down. I guess I'm just not sure what Tony Scott(top Gun, True Romance) was trying to convey here. I did not fell simpathetic towards Catherine Deneuve at all. David Bowie was very good while he was in the film, but I wanted to see more of him. Far and away the best part of this film were the love sequences with Susan Sarandon and Deneuve. That being said, if the best part of the movie is the sex scenes then it is usually bad. I really don't think this was a bad movie, I enjoyed the idea behind it but not the delivery of the material. I guess with the cast and director I just expected more."
2,"Dissapointing, to say the least.","I heard a lot about this movie. David Bowie! Vampires! Bauhaus!Well, I thought, I like Anne Rice. I like vampires. I like ""gothy"" movies. Why not see The Hunger?I was dissapointed. Sure, the movie was pretty, but plotless and extremely boring. The only good parts were the beginning (mainly because of ""Bela Lugosi's Dead""), and the parts that had a young David Bowie in them. The rest of it was a typical 80's B movie."
5,A new take on Vampira,This film moves away from the traditional Transylvania clap trap and moves into the 20th century with a believable concept of how the body changes from mortal to immortal. David Bowie is wonderful in this character roll and the make-up effects used on him are stunning. 10 stars!
1,don't waste your money on this,"It's funny that today's reviews are positive and all the rest I saw are very negative. Don't get me wrong, I love David Bowie. He's a great actor. But this movie is not only slow-moving, it's boring, tacky, and crying for plot. It's also suffering from a serious lack of Bowie in the second half of the film at which point i'd happily smash my copy of the movie just so I would never have to watch it again. If a story were to be written out explaining this film, it would be no longer than one paragraph and it makes me wonder how they managed to fill the time when the amount of plot barely would have done well for a half-hour show. If you want to see David Bowie in something good, buy The Man Who Fell To Earth. It's a particularly interesting movie and shots from the movie can be seen on such album covers as Low and Ziggy2. So, in closing, don't buy or even rent The Hunger. It's a complete waste of time."
3,"Beautifully filmed, but silly and pretentious","The opening sequence should have warned me: Bauhaus doing ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" intercut with scenes from some New York Euro-trashy dance club. Oh, no, I thought, another Anne Rice-esque ""Vampire as Gothic Rebel"" new-wave flick. Which it is, and not much else. The beautiful David Bowie ages to decrepitude early in the movie, leaving us with the rather uninteresting story of Miriam and Sarah--will they stay together? WHO CARES? Still, it was beautifully filmed; Delibes' ""Viens, Mallika"", as gorgeous a piece of music as ever was composed, is used to good effect. I can't recommend it, though."
4,Lesbian Erotica at it's best,Combining two well known stars this movie uses sex to sell and does not disappoint those who purchase for that reason. Not alot of redeeming quality here - hahaha but none the less as far as vampire movies are concerned it's not all that bad. If you're into the horror look elsewhere but for erotica this is a key.
5,A FAVE MOOVIE!!!,This is one of my all time favorite movies... i loved it even before vampire movies were popular. Catherine DeNueve (sp) and Bowie are great and Susan Saradon is fabulous too.
4,Moody Vampire Classic,"A moody, atmospheric re-rendering of the vampire story. Catherine Deneuve is... well, she's Catherine Deneuve: elegant, beautiful, with a timeless/ageless quality this movie makes the most of. David Bowie co-stars in one of his best film performances. Wonderful photography and sound track lend to the atmosphere. A must-see for anyone captivated by the vampire mythos."
5,Rich and elegant,"This film decisively breaks the mold set for ""vampire movies."" Catherine Deneuve brings elegance, David Bowie brings style, and Susan Sarandon brings skill and depth. The movie is very much about the people, it's about control and trust.The storytelling is a bit vague at times, but that's OK. The movie carries itself in its imagery. The nightclub in the first scene, a bizarre transformation in a furnace, and of course the seduction - wonderful scenes, even if taken in isolation. Bowie and Deneuve, promising ""forever,"" put an additional chill into the first scene of his coffin.I find it hard to describe this movie - the action is subdued but meaningful. The visual styling has subtlety, something I appreciate more after seeing other movies that lack it.I like this one. I have trouble saying just why, but it's one I'll come back to, again and again.//wiredweird"
3,the point,"Because it is fairly well known, I often cite this movie to others not as a good or bad movie, but as referential shorthand of a social phenomenon I'll explain in short order.I was hunting an online review I could link to the movie title which I used with an article about Strom Thurmond's last term in the Senate. Although some reviews at this Amazon aggregate come close, nobody spells it out so I will.The cliche that age uses guile to overcome fleetness of youth is an understatement. The harsh verity, ever growing in graying America, is that youth is fodder for those who survive long enough to be old. Marketing cool to teens is just baiting prey.However stultified or glossy this movie, it is clearer than anything else mainstream in making the point that a vampire is a hyperbolic metaphor of age feasting on youth."
3,ok movie,I had heard it was a cult classic. The movie was ok but I expected better. I would only recommend buying this movie if it were a dollar.
3,"Well, it's a great start anyway...","I am an avid fan of all things vampire-related, and I bought this film with high expectations. And it was great...up until about Susan Sarandon and Catherine Deneuve's love scene. After that, the plot just seems to fizzle. David Bowie is great, as is the rest of the cast, but the story just doesn't really go anywhere. The opening scenes with an appearance by goth band Bauhaus are the best part to me (actually the main reason I bought the movie)."
4,How can you go wrong with Bela Lugosi's Dead as the opener?,"An interesting take on the vampiric myth of everlasting life that I really enjoyed. The boring love interest involving Sarandon aside, the interplay between the characters was inthralling. The music, Delibes especially, hauntingly lifts and subdues the flow of the story. David's short part in the film is terrific but too short. A definite late night must see."
3,"..cutting edge, back then.....","(IMHO) -Deneuve almost always has an alluring screen presence that's practically cliche; Sarandon was a very good, but on the subject side, I think we've become jaded with the likes of 'The Twilight Saga' and others in this genre(?) to the point that watching a film now that was slick, stylized, bold, risque, controversial, even disturbing at the time seems kinda tame---no criticism on the seduction scene, interesting still, to say the least"
4,A very intense movie,"The cold, indifferent and deadly nature of Vampyres was very well demonstrated by the actors. I've always enjoyed this movie."
4,Must See Movie,"Forget Twilight - this is an original, sexy, offbeat movie with all of the thrills and none of the juvenile exploits found in others."
4,Sleek and Sexy...,"From it's opening sequence in an upscale bar with a moody backdrop of Bauhaus music, this stylish classic captures the essence of the 1980's Dark Wave movement. In this adaptation of the lesbian vampire story, the magnificent Catherine Deneuve stars as vampiric seductress Miriam Blaylock and Susan Sarandon as Sarah Roberts, her chosen partner. The seduction scene is hot and sexy as Miriam slowly and casually lures Sarah into the bedroom while recounting the story of Lakme by Delibes. David Bowie also stars as John, Miriam's ailing lover. This haunting and sensual tale of lust and eternal life is as good today as it was is in 1983.Chris AldersonAuthor of the 2012 & 2013 Lesbian Film Guide"
3,Story of beginnings,"I liked this book, but not quite as much as some other Melody Carlson books I've read. I thought a few too many details worked out just a little too perfect,and too many characters experienced life-changing decisions unrealistically close to one another. But, it's a sweet story of starting over, forgiveness and redemption. Carlson knows how to write in a way that keeps the reader hanging in there right to the end."
1,Lego Kindergarten,"This game is not as good as the preschool version, which is great. Even the kids said they did not like it. There wasn't much to it. It was more on the level of beginning computor skills. The company should redo it or rename it to 2-3 year olds."
1,Doesn't work as advertised,"I bought this product for my 4 year old daughter. It looked like a great computer game. Unfortunately, when I loaded it onto my computer, it kept telling me that there was an error and did I want to report it to Microsoft? It is impossible at this point to play most of the games on the CD and she can never get past the first level. This game was not programmed well and would be a waste of your money to purchase."
2,My preschooler is not interested...,My 3 1/2 yo preschooler had fun first day. He doesn't want to play with it anymore after the first day... I feel like I wasted my money.
3,Sure to Be Interesting - Human Prehistory,"Give me education any time. I have not yet read this book but I have read many, many Idiot's Guide to books and am completely confident that this will be as enjoyable as the rest. I love reading and I love learning."
5,"A GREAT, FUN READ WITH ACTION GALORE","Special Ops was a very enjoyable book, one I'm glad I brought along with me on a recent business trip overseas. It was a real page-turner, with plenty of action, a lot of interesting characters and quite a few clever twists and turns. I hope they make a movie out of it someday."
2,Distracting technical inaccuracies,"The author attempts to cram several book ideas into one short novel and even this try is marred by numerous technical inaccuracies. One glaring example: AMRAAM, as the author correctly explains, is an acronym for Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile. It's use is to destroy other flying targets. Yet, he has F/A 18s firing these to destroy ground targets, and he refers to B2 bombers carrying AMRAAMs as cruise missiles. Such errors seriously detracted from my enjoyment of the book and undermined my presumption of professional research by the author and competent fact-checking by the editors."
1,Hopelessly out of date!,"This book spends way too much time dealing with ""Duplicating machines"", silly little forms, etc.. The chapter titles are there, but there is nothing of substance IN the chapters. Get the tape out! The cover cracks when you open the book, and the book virtually falls apart at Chapter 8. Don't fret though, Chapter 3 ""Working with Volunteers"" has the only useful paragraphs in the book anyway. Of the total 78 pages, pages 61 through 74 fell out completely but I felt this made an overall improvement to the book. I don't understand why this ""non-book"" was written."
1,Not very good,"This didn't help me at all. You have to already speek french to get anything out of it. It doesn't teach you how to speak french, just how to pronounce french words. I wish I could get my money back."
1,Doesn't Teach Basics/Not worth the Money,"This program includes 7 discs...True...but....NONE of the 7 discs teaches ANYTHING about basics. No introduction to basic grammar and form, not even introduction to the alphabet. The first 4 discs called Tell Me More are a big waste of time if you do not know the slightest bit about the french language. Also, it took some time to get the Tell Me More programs loaded and working on my system, which crashed my system more than me having to work and use it. All in all it is not worth the money...it will not teach you ANYTHING. This goes for the other Immersion Language Pro language versions, because all of them include this Tell Me More programs."
1,This software is horrible.,Navigating through this software is very difficult and confusing. It is almost as if you have to be able to speak french already to be able to use this software with any degree of success.The othe discs that come with this software are just as useless as the rest. I am very disappointed and I wish I had just saved my money and bought Learn French Now! 9.0 which is infinitely better.
3,"Not for beginners, but ...","OK. This series is definitely not for beginners. I am very skeptical of any program that hypes the ""total immersion"" approach and this ""instant immersion"" takes that to the nth degree. Adults just aren't wired that way. Nor do they have nothing else to do for four or five years except learn a language - - which is what infants do.A lot of time went into putting this series together and it would be a lot more successful if it were sold as a review course in conversational French for intermediate to advanced students. There is very little software available in that area and this package offers a relatively large volume of mid-level practice at a reasonable price.After reading some of the reviews on this page, I figured that out and was not disappointed."
1,wasted money,This is the worst french learning application i've seen. I thought before buying it that 7 cd's will teach me french from a beginning to an advanced level. But this is not the case.I've tried some other programs obtaining better results and they fit into just 1 CD.
3,Drums,If you want to learn to play all the Percussion insturments this book will teach you but some of the drumming vocabulary is difficult to understand.
1,the sound of an axe grinding,"michael doesn't like different opinions. john shelby spong writes about how we christians ought not to ignore parts of the bible we don't agree with. michael especially hates the way the new testament keeps harping on about actually helping the poor, turning the other cheek, thou shall not kill, and other bon mots guaranteed to turn a klanman's face red.peddling christian hate, what a contradictory mission to be on."
2,Bad PVC off-gassing smell,"This ball feels fine (I actually prefer the spikier nubs on it). BUT... it is made of PVC and has a terrible off-gassing smell (sort of a vague oil refinery smell) which also gets on your hands when you handle the ball. Yuck. My wife has a Rubz massage ball with flatter nubs that doesn't have this smell and is obviously made of a less noxious plastic. And no, the smell doesn't go away quickly if you air it out."
5,Best massage ball,Very strong massage ball filled with air. Good size provides nice surface area for a foot massage. It gives a strong yet gentle massage.
2,Disappointed,Painful to use. Not Stress reducing or relaxing at all. Points are very firm and are more painful than anything else. I would not recommend.
2,So so,Underwhelming. Not firm enough to massage very deeply. Foot Rubz ball is much better for the feet and Trigger Point massage ball is better for the rest of the body.
2,too small for price !,"Porcupine massage ball: I thought I was ordering a 4"" ball, the price of $5.99 made sense. I received a 2"" ball ! Too small, too soft not worth $5.99"
3,Misleading Description.,My porcupine hated it. The spikes aren't long enough to get past quills. I felt like I was just smothering him with a ball and he didn't like it at all.
1,Good Design of Poor Quality,"On the scale of 1 to 10. I will give it a 3. (1 being the least satisfaction, and 10 being the most satisfied). THE MATERIAL SMELLS TERRIBLE. I CAN NOT STAND THE SMELL."
1,Nasser,Chines made of very bad quality material with annoying plastic smell. I through it out without using it due to cheap materials that emits very bad smell even after cleansing it with water and soap. Please don't waste your money on this very bad product.
1,Not satisfying,"I bought this ball based on the reviews and the price. At first, I found this ball quite satisfying, but my parents told me that a wooden ball (similar ball made of wood) would have been quite better in acupressure therapy.My parents have been using wooden ball for a long time. Because this ball is soft, and when you press your foot or hand, it gets squeezed. Contrary to this, wooden ball hard and has better spikes, which is perfect for acupressure therapy. I would not recommend this product."
2,hard porcupine ball,Before you buy make sure you want a ball that is hard as a rock. I thought I was getting one like the one on Dr. Oz but it is not there is no give at all.
3,ok,This ball is not very firm. It would have been better had it been made from hard plastic that would not squeeze when you press.
2,Flimsy,Worked great until it tore at the seam (popped) after 20 minutes! Tried to give it to my dog but its too hard for her mouth :/
1,Flimsy,A tear along the seams emerged soon after use. popping it and making it useless. Only made for delicate use apparently.
1,Normally great - but this was a bad batch,"I ordered one of these from the same company in 2 years ago and it has been awesome. It's still going strong. BUT, I just ordered 3 more this month so I could keep them in different rooms and at work... within a week 2 out of the 3 have already come apart at the seams! I read the reviews and didn't see anyone else having this problem, so I assume I just got a bad batch. But they are useless when they come apart. No amount of superglue will hold it back together enough to use it for massages anymore. Amazon was great and did issue me a refund for the two balls that came apart though. I just hope the seller will find out what the problem was with this batch and hopefully it won't keep happening."
3,Its okay,It is okay. It is very prickly... It is hard for me to use sometimes without socks. It was worth the money though
5,Profound look into what community is all about,"The Seekers is a thought provoking look into what it is that makes us need one another. The author, BilliJo Doll takes us with her on a journey into her imagination that is thrilling and educational. You are entertained, educated and stimulated to think about the people and things around you. I can't wait for the next book!!"
3,"Authentic, but not for hurdy-gurdy fans","This disc is pretty authentic if you want medieval vocals with drone instruments--there is a hurdy gurdy here, along with epinette (kind of like a plucked psaltery, sounds like a mountain dulcimer). If you're looking for hurdy gurdy pyrotechnics, this is not the place; check Nigel Eaton or some of the other discs you find in a nearby search here. If you're starting out playing a 'gurdy this may be a good way to learn some easy parts."
4,Beautiful writing,"I like this book mainly because Campbell writes beautifully. The descriptions of the planets, signs, and houses are very insightful and delves in deeper than the other astrology cookbooks. If you would like to move to a level beyond the regular astrology books, please purchase this one."
1,2-for-1,"Great! Now you can waste your money on a moronic self-help book AND an idiotic, irrational text on a pseudoscience."
4,Fine book given its goals,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this is a good introduction, but not a detailed biography. I believe that is all its author intended, so I believe it deserves more than two stars."
2,Introductory biography,"This book is sold in the museum giftshops all over Italy. It's a quick read and a decent introductory biography of Michelangelo. The author covers the political climate during Michelangelo's life as much as he does Michelangelo's personal life. Then again, he served several Popes who had a major influence on his life and never really had a personal life. If you're looking for a broad overview, this is a decent book; however, you're not going to find any detailed descriptions of his artistic sculpting or painting processes or any artwork reproductions."
2,"Hard to read, not much info and a waste of time","I picked this book up in Florence after visiting the Uffizi gallery, as most booksellers were selling this book. As such, I expected it to be pretty good. I think the problem is the book seems to have originally been written in Italian and subsequently translated to English. The language is therefore not smooth and very choppy. I also disagree with most of the reviewers here in that I did not find it that informative. I would recommend not buying this book as it wasn't worth it. There are far better sources out there."
3,Michelangelo,The book is informative but written in a dry manner. Overall I enjoyed it and am glad I bought it.
3,"Smooth cut, but slow; and the blades wear out quickly","Bosch FS200ABU 7-7/8-Inch 20 Teeth per Inch High Alloy Steel Flush Cutting Fine Tooth Power Handsaw BladeI've used these blades for numerous construction projects with a Bosch 1640 saw. E.g., cutting off the bottom of door trim, to make room for ceramic tile. They have fine teeth, which makes for a smooth, but annoyingly slow cut. Next time, I'll get the blades with more teeth per inch, which cut faster.The biggest con with these 20 teeth-per-inch blades is they wear out way too fast. This makes their initial high cost downright exorbitant. If they lasted longer, they'd deserve 4 or 5 stars.Here's a tip to cutting the bottom of door trim. To cleanly remove 1/2"" of trim, lay a 1/2"" piece of plywood on the floor next to the trim, and let the saw blade slide on the plywood as you cut."
1,lousy blade,"Had I known that they would come up with oscillating tool that does more than this Bosch for less money, wouldn't have looked at this garbage. In addition, the balde on this Bosch wears faster than any blade. An absolute waste of money."
1,Disappointed!,This item was not what I was expecting. I can't believe I paid 20 bucks for this miniature bear! I bought another one for 13 somewhere else and it was the full size bear. Maybe you should specify the size of it next time!!! I can buy the same thing at Target for 5.00! What I thought I was buying was a full size grumpy bear not a miniature one!
1,ARE YOU KIDDING!,I got my Care Bear today and can not believe what I recieved! I spent WAY to much $$ to get such a little bear! The picture that is on there is definetly not the size of the bear! The hair on the top of its head is falling out all over the place. Did I say it was LITTLE! Wow! I will definetly NOT be buying from this company again!
1,Don't waste your money,"First, these are not their Olympic performances, but mostly watered down professional routines. Double turns in the jumps, not triple turns, easier routines. Then, mostly annoying, the music they perform to is so soft that you almost can't hear it. I never realized how much a part of the show the music is until I watched this disc. There is annoying talking that is quite loud, telling you what you are watching. It is just a very unsatisfying DVD."
1,Bad audio track,"The performances included are good, BUT one CAN NOT HEAR THE MUSIC that the performers are skating to. The music is at a very low volume with some female talking very loudly over it telling that they just did a ""triple something"". That amateur commentary was not necessary and is very distrubing. The audio ""engineer"" (if you can call him that) and the producer of this video should go back to high school and enroll in freshman audio-visual!"
3,Only one piece - not a set,Length:: 0:40 MinsThis item is only the locating pin. The attaching screw is not included.
2,""" Simply a Compilation CD ""","Over the past few years, I have purchased seemingly most of the available music by Rev. James Moore. I thought I was purchasing some new material / music. This is Simply a Complilation CD. It's comprised of music from a few of his other cd's, even though there is already a Best Of Rev. James Moore cd available. Never-the-less,the music still glorifies "" GOD ""."
3,too complicated,"my son simply did not have the time to attempt this book, too complicated to review vocab!"
5,Neural Network Bible,"This is THE neural network and brain theory reference. Owning it is like owning an entire library, though much more compact.If you take a look at the table of contents, you'll see the massive value in this book. If you're into neural nets and brain theory, or want to be, you need this book."
4,Realistic Spy Movie,Ignore the reviews that claim this is a piece of propaganda. Some people are so polarized they see what they want to see. This is a realistic movie about spies and how people in this realm are master manipulators of human nature. And how this underworld is corrupt beyond measure. The only reason it is not 5 stars is that it starts a little slow. But the ending is a kick in the head.
4,Burton Always Makes the Character His,"Richard Burton, even when miscast (and here he most certainly is not), always turns in a great performance. In the The Spy Who Came In From the Cold, he comes through once again. Burton's character is believable and seems genuine in his on-screen relationships. His monologues are delivered in the familiar Burton style - intense and interesting, and impossible to overlook. It has been written elsewhere that Oskar Werner almost steals the show in this film, and I would agree. His character matches Burton's for realism and depth. Claire Bloom, the quintessential dramatic supporting actress, is also quite good - she gives her character innocence and a caring nature - the perfect compliment and antithesis to the ruthlessness of the film's underlying themes. This is one of my favorite films. There are unfortunately no more Richard Burtons."
4,BLEAK AND BRILLIANT,This grim and bleak cold war thriller recalls a time and place and politics that no longer exist. John Le Carre's first novel about a British agent who refuses to take a safe desk job and instead launches into the potentially deadly assignment of stalking an East German person of interest.A weary looking Richard Burton stars as the burned-out agent in this suspenseful and ultimately sad tale of an expendable life in a lost cause.The film had a difficult history. Burton resented director Martin Ritt who insisted Burton underplay his part. Burton finally walked off the set and had to be cajoled out of his dressing room. But Ritt was correct as Burton received an Oscar nomination for his performance and the film is considered a classic.
3,Good but if you have read the book its short!,"Ive noticed many times that if you have read the book there are details that aren't adapted to the onscreen adaption of the film. This is one of those films in which it will not tell you what is going on the characters head and what the character was thinking or doing in prison. There is a good chunk of the film that didn't deal with the story of Mundtz or the critical letters that told the motivation of the characters.However, most of the critical pieces of the story was told in its entirety and I was pleased with the film I should of bought the Criterion Edition but just noticed it today while searching for it. I doubt I would of cared for the extras so this dvd was perfect.I was actually impressed with the black and white actually the contrast and the hues had a great fit with the overall dark nature of the film. This film is good for what it is but do not be disappointed if it doesn't live up to the book."
4,"MARTIN RITT, OPUS 11","**** 1965. Based on John Le Carré'sThe Spy Who Came in From the Coldand directed by Martin Ritt. Two Academy awards nominations (Richard Burton and Art Direction) and Golden Globe earned by Oskar Werner (Supporting Actor). The British Secret Intelligence service tries to frame the East Germans by sending Richard Burton, undercover, to them. Martin Ritt perfectly managed to recreate in this film the sinister and shady world of the cold war period. Berlin, London, the Netherlands and East Germany all look the same in the eyes of Richard Burton who journeys through a continent that seems wrapped up by an eternal fog. Highly recommended."
5,"The Seedy, Drab Cold War","Watching this brings back memories of the early '60's and the Cold War. I was only in middle school, but the Cold War was really the premise of our involvement in Viet Nam. And, everyone felt it.The sights, sounds and feelings of the time are chronicled in this great film. With fantastic performances by the stars of the British and German film industries, we follow the convoluted plot as the characters hurtle toward their resurrection at the end. By today's standards, the film looks like box office poison with cynical spies, furtive dialog, hidden meanings, but this was a big film. Even MAD magazine parodied the film, including the very last scene. Thanks to TV, our ability to own and rent films, we can enjoy it, too.yet the puppeteers of the plot move the pawns quickly through the process.s"
4,Great movie,This is an example of a spy/mystery movie that makes its points by acting and cinematography rather than special effects.
5,The Spy who Came In from The Cold,"This is probably one of Richard Burton's best performances and deserves more attention. It is the story of a Cold War spy sent out to pasture as a clerk in a book store/library. He turns to alcohol to escape the humm-drum existence. The ""agency"" has one more job for him to do and brings him out of retirement. Is he being set up or is there something deeper afoot. This is NOT the glitzy James Bond spy!! A cold, hard, look at the world of spies during the Cold War Era and the smarmy people in their world. Very thought provoking and a great performance by Burton."
5,It's a love story. SPOILERS FOLLOWING,"It's a true love story that happens to take place between a spy and a lovely innocent woman. The spy offers his life not once but twice in attempts to save his lover. Ultimately, they both lose their lives, but he didn't offer his life to save anyone else. A spy that puts his life at risk for country on countless occasions, however, he lies and fights and murders to stay alive, until this woman is in jeopardy. I call that a love story wrapped in a spy movie."
1,Have not received a credit for wrong DVD format received.,"I received a PAL2 format of this DVD from a Great Brittain source, Rarewaves-Imports; and this format was not indicated on the order site. I knew not to order one from reading other U.S. reviews over the years. I sent it back, and the cheapest shipping was $5.34 since it was going to Great Brittain. I shipped it over a month ago; and I have received no correspondence or refunds. I paid $9.19 for the DVD plus the shipping back. This is the first time I have ever had a problem with British sources."
3,"Holds up ok, but somewhat overrated","Richard Burton, back in the day, was among Hollywood's biggest leading men. However, his acting skills today would not get him to first base. There are moments here where I just laughed at how bad this was. The plot does thicken nicely as things go on, but it devolves into a TV courtroom drama at the end. I was disappointed. Burton is full of smoldering looks that go on too long. Maybe that was the editing style of the day. This 1965 period piece seems much older than that, maybe mid-50s in tone and tempo. Watchable, but as a museum piece, only."
5,"A great story, great acting -- unforgettable and haunting","One gets the sense that these are the people, the scenes and the atmospherics that paraded through le Carre head as he wrote this great story. Burton is perfect as the self-hating, burnt out case, cynical, alienated, yet still possessing a darkly humorous outlook on the world. Claire Bloom is completely believable as a naive Communist. The supporting cast of British and East German espionage agents are first rate. The story is absorbing, exciting and complex without being inpenetrable. The ending is unforgettable. A great movie."
4,Great coverage and a great value.,"This book is very well written with a few minor exceptions. The step by step methodology used by the authors' was very easy to follow. When I finished reading each chapter, I went through the test questions and used the testing software.The mistakes in the testing software were very minor and I simply downloaded a fix from the web site provided in the book.Overall a very good book, I am pleased with it and plan to buy the other course guides in the series."
3,Wait for a SYBEX BOOK,"While I like the format of this book I cannot overlook the number of errors and inaccuracies it contains. The Testing software it comes with is of no use as it rarely knows the correct answer. The questions in the book are not much better as they too were filled with errors. I HIGHLY recommend getting a CISCO guide or waiting for SYBEX to publish one.An experienced Test Taker,Dan MCSE CCNA"
2,Good overview but lacking in depth,I'll give this book credit for the fact it is easy to read but that's about it. I had thought the Cisco Press book was lacking until I read this one. It's a decent book on switching but I didn't find it very useful for passing the CCNP switching exam. I would recommend the Cisco Press and the Todd Lammle books. Reading the two of them will surely prepare anybody for the exam. The McGraw Hill book just doesn't have the depth and isn't very accurate. I also noted that the technical editor is a CCNA/DA. I find it hard to believe that a technical editor can provide much insite on a study guide for a certification that is beyond what he has. Spend your money on Todd Lammle's and Karen Webb's books and let this dog lie.
3,Good Overview with many errors,"I used this book as a add-on for the test preparation. Topics like switch configuration and network design were covered in a need-to-know manner. The case studies are way too long and tedious to read. The tests are erronous all over. There was not a single chapter where all the test questions were valid. The CD-ROM is of no help for the test preparation. The answers concerning routing (think of the RSM!) are 75% wrong. You can easily evaluate this by reading the ACRC course doc. or even in the book itsself. As a supplement to the course documentation this book is OK. For test preparation, have a look into a original Cisco course doc."
3,"Good overview, lacks depth","The material in the book is well presented, when it is correct, but there are numerous errors. The early chapters are well presented and flow nicely, with good conceptual explanations.Unfortunately, the last half of the book is disjointed and difficult to follow, with poor diagrams and little conceptual information. Two chapters are spent on material not covered on the exam. I would not have passed the exam on the strength of this book. VTP and Multicast subjects in particular are not very well thought out. An additional problem is that the included test engine has an incredibly high error rate; I'm aware of a patch, but lots of people won't think of that. RIP does equal Rest In Peace, but not in a routing environment."
1,Don't waste your money on this one - Buy the Cisco Press one,"Don't make the same mistake I made! If you rely on this book to pass the BCMSN exam then you will need a miracle! The book has lots of technical errors to do with concepts associated with the BCMSN. I stopped reading it after the first two chapters. The title of the book is incorrect to start with. It should read ""Building Cisco Multilayer Switched Networks"" not ""Building Cisco Multilayer Switching Networks"" ! Some/all of the writers (and reviewers) just missed too many important concepts; and the figures are not illustrative of the concepts being discussed at all ! And the companion CD questions are not indicative of what's in the exam at all ! How do I know all this ? Because I passed the BCMSN thanks mostly to the Cisco Press book (by Karen Webb)"
1,The Self Exam is the worst I have ran accross,"I started the book by taking the self exam. It is of such poor quality that I may not read the book fearing that it will be of equally poor quality. A few examples The port RIP uses is 1058, Maximum hop count in a RIP network is 7, RIP is a link state protocol."
1,not reccomended for exam study,"this book will be reccomended only for a general idea of how switching works, but not for the exam. this book says exam is 3 hours long with several questions. Exam is only 60-70 questions. Book does not cover ATm, exam had 6 questions on atm. Book dose not cover LANE, exam had 7 questions on LANE, and the book has a lot of technical in-accuracies. I would reccomend the cisco press book for BCMSN. Happy studying, btw i read the Cisco book and passed the exam with a 770"
5,Rhymes and Bright Pictures Make This Book a Hit,"""Mice Squeak, We Speak"" is one of the first books my son started to reach for and request that I read to him. It is one he can listen to over and over--and, fortunately, it's fun for me to read aloud to him.Each animal sound is introduced with a simple two-word sentance and a colorful, full-page drawing of the animal. The rhythmic, rhyming passages, coupled with the fact that the pages are turned quickly (no more than four words per two-page spread) make this a favorite for early listeners or readers.I highly recommend this book for young children to introduce them to listening to and reading books."
5,Adorable,"The three children are absolutely adorable. The animals are cute. The word bites in this book are short and to the point. This is a great book for toddlers and early pre-readers. It can easily keep the attention of both of my children. I enjoy reading this book to my children and have yet to get tired of it. Certainly, this book is a good addition to your child's library."
4,Great,I really liked this book and enjoyed the pictures. The book was well written and the pictures really made the book come alive. Great read.
3,Strange and bewildering,"I found this book extremely strange, and to put it mildy, I was also bewildered. I didn't understand it most of the time, and then I'd read a bit further, and then understand what had happened previously, but some new bizarre thing would happen, and I'd be in the same boat. I did not ""get"" Pribble, and I didn't really get the ending either. Dickinson description of the cathypnic children is actually wonderfully done. He shows a great deal of understanding and tenderness when he describes these children. Peter Dickinson is noted for creating strange and fascinating worlds, and he has certainly done it with this book. That part of the book actually overshadowed the mystery when it did finally come. He also does an admirable job in his characterizations. His description of the eccentric millionaire is quite wonderful, but I found the strangeness of the book kind of took away from that a bit."
3,Too small for its size,"My daughter is 11 and with a normal built, I ordered a size 14 and it was small in the back so I had to have it fixed. Not of great quality but it served it's purpose, she had a lot of fun."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Though the merchandise arrived in good condition, beware of Adam Hersh Poster's shipping charges! This postcard and 3 others were mailed in one envelope, weighing a total of one ounce, via the U.S. Postal Service. The ""shipping"" charge? $9.99!"
2,disappointed in square d,"I was happy about getting the item .Compact size and steel enclosure.I haven't worked that much with the homeline version by square d and now I no why its cheaper.I've been doing electrical work for about 30 years and found this to be among the hardest devices I have ever wired.The bottom line is there just isn't enough room to work with 6ga wire in this box.I was very disappointed because I always go with square d if I can.However when it comes to spa panels, spend the extra $25-30 and get the ""cuttler hammer"" model that comes with 2 extra branch circuits and comes in a metal housing.It has more room, even if you dont need the extra circuits, the installation time and aggrevation you save will be worth the money."
5,make perfect snowballs,"The snowball makers arrived on time and in good condition. These are so much fun, and are used far more than I anticipated. Less expensive here than some stores where I've seen them."
3,Breaks too easily,The snowball maker broke upon the first 5 seconds of usage. All my four-year old did was to strike lightly at the one-day old snow (which was not all that hard). Quite a disappointment.
5,My kids and hubby love this!,"So this was hands-down the best stocking stuffer. My kids have loved it, hubby loves it, and the neighbor kids come knock on the door and ask to borrow it! Very durable construction."
1,not what I ordered!,"The website says that the product is a ""Flexible Flyer Snowball Maker."" What I received was some off-brand that was a similar product, but did not have the hand grips that the Flexible Flyer has, and the grips (and the quality brand) were the reason I was willing to pay more to order these products. I would NOT order from this company again because they made a product substitution without asking if that was acceptable to me."
5,Great toy!,"We bought this and the snow block maker for my kids for Christmas. I should have bought one for us, the parents as well. Great toy. Well made, heavy plastic. Makes perfect size snowballs that are perfectly compact. My kids have been outside playing with it most of the day. Great winter fun! I would highly recommend it to everyone, just buy more than one, once you start everyone will want to use it."
4,Pretty good,It has to be in the right snow but it still is fun! Also you have to be careful that you dont clamp it together too hard because the snowballs split in half. It is so fun because I can make snowballs faster.
2,Broke,"Makes great snowballs, but broke after a half hour of use, right where the screw is. Very disappointing. I thought maybe it was bad luck and I would just replace it since it doesn't cost much, but I looked at the second one I bought and noticed it looked stressed too. I supposed if you don't apply too much pressure it will last a long time but try telling a 4 and 7 year old that."
5,well made and lots of fun,"Well made and lots of fun. My 6, 10 and 18 year old love this product. Good clean winter fun!!"
3,Not what I thought,"I hope it does make good snowballs because I'm going to cream the kids in the family if it ever snows enough to have a good snowball fight. But I thought it was more for making any kind of spherical shaped item and no.... its probably perfect for snow balls but it did not work for making anything I was trying to make. Meanwhile, Why didn't we have cool stuff like this when I was a kid?"
3,Does what its supposed to do,"Remember the days when you had to pack your own snowballs? Well, no longer! Why pack your own snowballs when you can have a pair of tongs that does it for you? I don't know about you, but making snowballs is very tough for me. I mean, putting your hands in the snow and packing the snowballs is for people who can't afford nifty snowball makers. Using this snowball maker is as easy as....packing the snow with your own hands! Imagine what humans could have created if these were invented hundreds of years ago."
2,item arrived scratched and smelled like smoke,"Item was cute, but within the plastic wrap, the item had scratches and smelled like a smoker. not sure why."
4,It's a snowball maker.,"Works great, sturdy construction, makes perfectly round snowballs. However, I was able to find it cheaper in stores by a couple of dollars."
5,awesome snowball makers,The experts (the kids) compared this snowball maker to what some friends had and my kids say that this one is far better. We bought 2 per kid so they could double-fist their snowball making. They love 'em.
3,Snowball maker,Suggested I buy this to make bath bomb fizzies it did not work well at all but then it says SNOWBALL maker
4,Had this when i was a kid and i love it!,"It's a hard game to play, only has one level, but you know how nostalgia works with games! Therefore i love this game and had to buy it. I normally play it through emulation but i had to have an actual copy."
3,Is it worth it?,"Forking out more cash for an extra 4 tracks is hardly worth it. The DVD isn't anything special either. However, for all the people who don't know or haven't been around long enough, the JD track ""Makin' It Last All Night"" samples Jodeci's Freek 'N You Remix featuring Ghostface Killer and Raekwon. Good to hear a classic re-used in this remix. The remix of So Lonely featuring Twista also worth listening too. Decision is yours!"
2,Not her best...,"The Emancipation of Mimi is definitely there with Glitter and Charmbracelet as MC's worst works ever, this one just happened to have a catchier tune that made it a TOP hit. However, this is no ""Musicbox"".Just another one to listen once and then stash it."
5,great cd and dvd,"Ist of all, this is only the 2nd time this cd has been released. Not the 3rd or 4th like some are saying. When It 1st came out you could buy it with a poster or not. The cd itself was exactly the same. Same thing this time but with the choice of a dvd or not. As far as the music goes. I love all the songs with the exception of I WISH YOU KNEW. Hasnt grown on me yet. Now onto Madonna. Im not going to hate on madonnas cd. I actually kinda like it. But to her fans saying how Mariah is greedy for re-releasing her cd. Maybe you should take a look and see. Madonnas cd is being re-released only 1 month after its initial release."
1,More of the same?,"Ok, the Emancipation of Mimi was one of the best Mariah Carey albums ever, but rereleasing this so soon? and with more of the same old songs? WHAT a RIPOFF!!!"
1,Ñañañañaña REBIRTH,"At least J'Lo can act good, Mariah dissappear faster than a Glitter =(Buy REBIRTH NOW!"
1,"well, i didnt like it~~",it was horrible~~~i regret having bought this with my money...it was not worth it!!!
4,Why re-release with 4 songs?,"I love Mariah and this CD. 1 mistake though. Why re-release a CD with just 4 more songs? And only 2 of them were really brand new. Don't Forget About Us and Makin' It Last All Night (What It Do.) So Lonley (One And Only Part 2) and We Belong Together Remix can be heard in other places. So Lonley can be heard on Twista's new CD and We Belong Together Remix can be heard on the radio every 10 minutes. I heard these other 2 songs that are bumping called Sprung and Secret Love. Why weren't these on this version of The Emancipation of Mimi. That would have been a good version of this CD. 1 tip. When re-releasing don't release songs that have already been heard before - over and over and over again.Besides that I really like this CD. Highlights of this CD is Joy Ride, Fly Like A Bird, Circles, Mine Again, and I Wish You Knew. If you are going to buy this CD you would be better off buying the regular edition. Seriously you have heard all of the bonus tracks."
1,Mariah needs to swallow a chubby,"Come on man, she is a vile nasty cash pig, who needs to stuff a sausage down her throat!! How could she be so disrespectful to her loyal fans, and announce some sought of crappy diamond deluxe edition, which is apparently as big as her huge gut.Mariah, baby, please stop treating us like animals, and please lose some weight before you decide to wear another revealing dress again."
1,Repetitive,"This album is a minor improvement on the first edition of teom, but the new songs arent that great either. Dont forget about us sounds exactly like we belong together, and her songs are too rnbish. I liked the old mariah who was contemporary, and didnt succumb to peer pressure of the music industry."
1,Should be called the Re-re-re-emancipation of Mimi.,"This is just another cheap move by MC's company to milk the cow and abuse it's loyal fans by releasing for the 4th time (yes, 4 times) the same album with additional remixes.And to milk the cow even more, there's 2 versions of the ultra-platinum edition, one with only the new CD and one with a DVD with 4 of her videos (yet again the same songs, only that now I can watch her move 2 steps...) and a documentary (that is frickin' hard to activate)Waste of money. Buy her Christmas album instead which is more appropiate for this seasons."
3,If only this album was the orginal and not the fourth remake,"I like Madonna and Mariah Carey, I loved the Emancipation of Mimi the orginal but I am just disapointed in the fact that she will rerelease 3 other editions of her already very succesful Emancipation of Mimi. If this album was the orginal or hell with the 2nd release we wouldn't care, but that face is it is the fourth! Mariah u always say u care about the fans well, before u release ur next album dont make no more rereleases and maybe we wouldnt be calling u a fat cash cow."
1,Silly Lambs,Everyone knows that its a myth and propaganda that Mariah is the #1selling female. If you go by ACTUAL album sales Madonna is 1 and Celine is 2. Madonnas new album is looking to outsell Mimis in a few more weeks world wide! And who cares if Mariah is getting her 17th number one. That chart is no longer based on sales but spins at radio. Not hard for her to get a number 1now when stations are only playing Hip Hop and R&B!
5,"Great CD, Excellent Re-Release","I first bought The Emancipation of Mimi back in April and was very excited because it was a return to form for Mariah. But this re-release is even better. If you're just a casual fan, I would still recommend purchasing this version because you get 4 extra songs: Don't Forget Aboout Us, Makin' It Last All Night, So Lonely (One and Only Part II), and the We Belong Together (Remix). In addition, you get the music videos for: It's Like That, We Belong Together, Shake It Off, and Get Your Number. This is a great sounding CD and great DVD from start to finish. I would highly recommend this CD/DVD package."
1,disappointed in mariah,I've been buying her records for years even during her glitter and charmbracelet periods and was really happy for her suceess with mimi and instead of releasing a beautiful ballad from the album she goes and releases this with a horrible parody of we belong together called don't forget about us. Sorry but it makes her look really greedy and I'll have to think twice about buying any album of hers again next time around.
5,A Comeback Worth Remembering,"Mariah sung her way onto the music scene 15 years ago and blew people away with her great voice. And once again, she has made an incredible return enchanting listeners all over again. This is a comeback for the ages. Mariah Carey has always been known for her great signature ballads like VISION of LOVE, HERO, and MY ALL. And now with this great album she gives us WE BELONG TOGETHER, MINE AGAIN, I WISH YOU KNEW, FLY LIKE A BIRD, and DON'T FORGET ABOUT US. Mariah has also been known throughout the years to do rap-sung collaborations. So you get notable guest appearances by Snoop Dogg on SAY SOMETHIN', Twista on ONE and ONLY and SO LONELY, Jermaine Dupri on GET YOUR NUMBER and MAKIN' IT LAST ALL NIGHT. I have to say that I'm really impressed with this re-release. Mariah made a great album even greater. Don't hesitate to buy this excellent CD/DVD."
1,"Mariah is hungry for your money, and a couple of muffins too","Oh yes, the human cow is back, for the 4th time, and she needs another feeding of your hard earned money. Go on, be good little lambs and feed her, let her live her lavish lifestyle whilst you lambs work a 9to5 crummy job. Let her keep eating, so she can get fatter, and show us more skin (literally).Go on Lambs, open your wallets and feed her, remember to save some money for the new Ultra-Platinum Double Cheese and Sauce edition, comming your way next year."
1,The Glutony Of Mimi,"Greed is usually the demise of any respected or successful human. Mariah is certainly cementing her own demise with these trashy, cheap and mis-calculated releases. She is rumoured to be re-releasing this album again in late december, with a bonus disc of remixes. if these rumours prove to be true, then she has completely lost the plot, if she thinks people will buy this mediocre album a fifth time.Talk about over-staying your welcome!!!"
1,She reminds me of a stuffed sausage,"How many times has this album been ""released"" in order to garner sales? I realized that this album flopped internationally, so she has to make a buck somehow. The only good song on this album is ""It's Like That,"" only because the beat is addicting. Still, it's pathetic that Mariah has to constantly surround herself with rappers in order to stay relevant."
1,If I had the chance I'd rip Mariah's head off.,"Listen to me now, people. I did buy the original version of the Emancipation of Mimi. I DID! I DID! I DID! I DID! I DID! I DID! I DID!!!!!!!!!!!Now that you've got that into your head, let me just say, people should not buy this edition, nor should they buy the edition coming out near Christmas. Come to think of it, Mariah doesn't deserve anymore success or to sell records anymore because of her stupid cash-ins.Also, how cocky is the new title? The DIAMOND edition (released near to Christmas). Hint, hint, she wants her fans to get her a third diamond certification (Daydream and Music Box also gained this achievement). Well...this cash-in (or should I say, THESE cash-ins) are working, she's already half way there (this album is already certified 5x Platinum as of 8th December 2005). It's just a shame and such a pity she has to cheat to get there..."
1,What are you doing Mariah!?,"A 5th release of the same album on the way! Is this the only way she can sell this album by having the same people buy it over and over!? No wonder this woman never goes on Stadium tours, cause she could never sell one out! Unless she finds a way to clone her lambs which I am sure she is working on. Madonna can sell out The Garden six nights in a row like she did with her last tour. Mariah is over if she needs to do this to sell."
2,I think,"that her voice isnt as good as it used to be. Now she is too breathy, and her voice isnt as clear and powerful as before. Now it sounds raspy and abit like michelle williams voice. I dont like the new sound of her music either. Its too jazzy rnb and too much rnb and hip hop. I want to her some more songs like forever, and vision of love, and not only rnb just because its going to pay her."
1,"Mariah, what have you done?","Mariah's career has been a freefall since day one. This album is nothing as good as earlier MC's hits. The first albums (particullary Musicbox) are what Mimi should have done always. It seems like she will never produce quality hits such as ""Hero"" anymore. But oh well, those where the good times...Also, the CD quality is very lood, the production falls short."
1,The Lambs Have Been Slaughtered,"While Mimi has been emancipated, all of her lambs have been placed into bondage to keep buying any lame CD she puts out. Mariah Carey went downhill back in 1997 and I haven't supported anything she has done since then. She doesn't appeal to me anymore with her whispy vocals, implants, and attempt to be down with the hip-hop thang. So now in the ""music"" world you have this new thing where you re-release the same lackluster album, each time adding a little something on that doesn't contribute anything worthwhile. Simply because it's Mariah Carey that's reason enough to get this so-called ""Ultra Platinum"" CD/DVD edition. What's the next re-release going to be called? Emancipation of Mimi Super Duper Maxi Ultra Platinum Plus? Anyway, this re-relase sucks just as much as the original, probably much more since it's a greedy attempt to rip off folks. But hey, you suckers get what you pay for: nothing."
1,Time goes by so slowly when listening to mariah,"Mariah's music is full of contrived cliche lyrics, sung over tried and tired beats, immaculately polished to fit the radio airwaves. Forget substance, edge or any sense of diversity, Mariah is in it for the hits, and if it means selling her soul, then so be it.You see, the difference between Madonna and Mariah is quite simple:Madonna is a pioneer of our times, an artist who goes against the grain, and challenges social norms. Her power and passion far transcends only her music, as she is a cultural icon. her music may not always sell in the tens of millions, but it makes a statement, and with time, it is appreciated for the risks it took.mariah is a pioneer(purchaser) of hit songs."
1,Back to the looney bin with you woman!,"Only a mad woman would release the same record 86 times just to cheaply garner as many sales as possible. Look out for January when she releases The Super Topaz Diamond Encrusted Platinum Titanium Steel 24 Carrot Gold Super Bling Bling Edition with a bonus track of Mariah singing about tulips, rainbows, butterflies, lucky charms, and lollipops! Do not miss out on this lambs or Mariah might have to join her sister out on the street corners."
1,Obviously another artist who doesn't care about the fans.,"Ok, it's official. Because of this, I no longer like Mariah. Why should us non-TeamLamb used-to-be fans respect her if she has none for us? No wonder she calls you her lambs. You ain't helping either. You are trashing Madonna and Mariah is getting low ratings for this. While I hate the members of TeamLamb with more passion than I hate Mariah, Mariah took a wrong step. Very wrong...bad idea! The original album is good, but this is just a waste of money, plus you'll be falling into Mariah's trap of trying to gain a diamond certification."
1,NO MORE!!!!!!,"oh boy!!! Now we will be getting yet another re-release of this album at the end of December. And this is all so Mariah can suck more money out of the pockets of her fans so she can buy more donuts and get even fatter. For only $27.99 you get a fifth re-release featuring We Belong Together Part 2 (So So Def Fat Cow Remix: featuring Twista, Snoop Dogg, Missy Elliot, Da Brat, Ludacris, Nelly, Busta Rhymes, Jay Z, Puff Daddy and Jadakiss). So everyone run out and buy it right away, after all you will have to wait another two months before she re-releases it yet again for $49.99 with another bonus cd of her farting the tracks into the microphone. There are actually some musicians who don't need to re-release an album five times in order for it to go platinum."
1,No more please.,"I used to like Mariah, but at the point where she's released four versions of this album, I'm getting sick of her cashing-in on people. I feel sorry for the guys who have to buy all four editions just for the sake of completing their collection! Shine like the star you once were, Mazza!"
1,DISAPOINTMENT,now let me say im a big fan of mariah i just don't hink rereleasing this album was necisary i also dont think is her best work anyway i would much rather see a re-release of an album like daydream or music box rather than this...
1,This re-release is as big as mimi's rear end!!,"The only thing which is ultra-platinum about this relese is Mimi's back side, as she is one bloated mamma. Seriously, stop buying her records and supporting her eating habits. It is disgraceful!!!Madonna is skinny, beautiful and talented. She doesn't need implants to sell albums. Mariah, put that cake down now!!!!"
1,For shame.,"I am truly disgusted. Are some consumers being punished for running out and getting this cd when it was first released? Here we are, two singles later, with an 'expanded' version of this project. I know what the marketing team thought: ""We'll get the people who already have it to buy it again, to get the additional tracks...and we'll finally hook the ones who have thinking about buying it, but haven't yet..."". I can't speak for everyone, but I'm sick of this 'double-dipping' that's become so common in the industry. I and won't be suckered into it...I'll just get a copy - yes, a COPY, from a friend. Ugh."
1,What is this heiffer thinking?,"Lord knows, this owman is so tired and played out it is not funny. The only times she has been an interesting artist was when she went looney tunes and tried to kill herself and when that sick girl wrote her a letter and she responded with: ""Excuse me Miss, but I have problems of my own."" Now that was a laugh riot!Here is just a few remixes added to an already craptacular CD. Yes she has a voice, but she only sings unremarkable songs. Her flirtations with brilliance (""Honey"" and ""Heartbreaker"") are long gone.Save your $$$ and buy the new fabulous Confessions On A Dance Floor. It blows this cow out of the water."
1,Bad Album,"This record stinks, and Mariah is not the best selling female. Even if she was it would only be because she plays it safe and never has an opinion. Madonna has taken on abortion(Papa Dont Preach). She took on the Catholic church(Like a Prayer). She proved that women could own their sexuality and not be victims of it, and spoke out for gay rights(Erotica Era). She stood up against war and took on Bush(American Life). What has Mariah stood up for? Butterflys? Gli tter? Charmbracelets?"
2,I think that,"This album is abit overhyped. I dont hate mariah, but i dont like the kind of music that is on this cd. They are merely repetitive rnb songs. I would rather have seen songs like open arms, and forever on this cd. I also think that there are too many featured artists on the cd. Only about five of the songs are just mariah."
5,I Agree....This IS a Flawless C.D..4Extra Tracks + 4 Video's,What a great YEAR it is has been for Mariah and the Awards and Accolades are just beginning for her..She is the New Queen..and Shows all thge other fakes how its done.....Me and Mariah Belong Together....
5,HATERS NEED TO GO!,"IF YOU NOTICE, MOST OF THE BAD REVIEWS ON THIS ALBUM IS FROM THE SAAAAAAAAAME PERSON! Check their other album reviews... there are NONE!!! and each and every single one of them references Jennifer Lopez (untalented and tasteless)! it surprises me how much time this person has to create multiple accounts just to bash mariah! i really, honestly don't get it. mariah is amazing. sure i disagree with her new release but that doesn't make her less talented."
1,Don't let yourself be fooled!!!,"This is the 3rd release of the same album, it only changes the cover and adds 4 lame remixes."
1,Don't waste a single buck,"The extra tracks just aren't worth it (unless you're a reeeeeally hardcore Boriah Carey fan). It's the same We Belong Together all over the place, 4 times more!!!."
1,The perfect method to steal money,"By relaunching for the 3rd time the same album with new songs that are EXACTLY (and I mean it literally) like the old onesAnd the lyrics? ""them chickens i'm sausage"" or something like that...What the he** was she thinking?"
1,The emancipation of screamy!!,"Bland! Bland! Bland! I used to love Mariah Carey (her first three cds were gold!!), however, she has just kind of slumped herself in between Beyonce and Ashanti. Nothing new here, nothing bold or daring or different. Just the same old tired and bland r&b. She's still got the voice, unfortunately it's just not enough nowadays. She's much more exciting when she's having a nervous breakdown."
3,Actually 3 1/2 stars,"There are a few Mariah tracks that sort of take you back to the Mariah Carey most fans grew up with, however, the album felt kinda forced and sung in a fashion for the sake of Mariah singing high notes. Her label has been picking all the wrong songs to be singles. They should have picked Stay The Night, Say Something and even the track featuring Nelly, although Nelly is becoming a parody of himself. She could have done better with her emancipation without the help of Jermaine Dupri. The 3 and-a-half stars stem from loving those three joints that I mentioned but it truly ends there."
3,Hope She Returns To Be Mariah!,"Briefly, without intention of offending nor even Mariah herself, a lot of people I know fan from her too, think the same: Hope She Returns To Be Mariah, the one from Vision of Love, and let their people around who just want to make money on her and if she takes those waves, she'll becoming a star easy to reach when she knows she has Platnum Voice to do what she wished. Selling records could be more if she would maintain the same styles, those new songs from Rainbow til the newest, are just meal to the Hip Hop followers, but it's not Mariah's way, B. Streisand has done different things singing, but she is still Barbra, why don't you Mariah!? You could be singing with her too as the BEST that you used to be! Just prove to be the same with new songs, not pretend selling what the most do, that's just a time nobody will remember as the years you were the ONLY n' ONE!Love YOU,Pedro Manuel Caminero (CUBA) with a lot of friends fan of you!"
5,I know how you feel......,"I know how you feel, why should I buy this album again, when I already have it? Well, you should because it has four new songs on it, including the new song ""Don't Forget Us,"" and ""One & Only Part II."" Plus, if you get it it comes with this DVD that has all this stuff on it inclding a never-before-seen interview from Mariah Carey, and the video for ""Get Your Number."" See what I mean? This is why you should buy this album again. I mean if you're a true Mariah Carey fan, you would buy it, right?"
1,"One limited edition is fine, FOUR is toooooo many!","I say four because she's released three limited editions of The Emancipation Of Mimi (the original version is obviously NOT a limited edition), and she's releasing a fourth limited edition soon, and a fifth version of the same album.1- The Emancipation Of Mimi2- The Emancipation Of Mimi Limited Edition3- The Emancipation Of Mimi Ultra Platinum Edition4- The Emancipation Of Mimi Ultra Platinum Edition w/DVD5- *COMING SOON!* The Emancipation Of Mimi Diamond Dulexe EditionPoint proved on why this is 1-star and why it deserves no credit. Sorry Mariah!"
1,Feels cheap.,"It's not artist-like to re-release an album and even less when EVERY SINGLE SONG depends on backing vocals from featured artists, this woman is only behind Ciara in the ""feature another artist cheap thingy"".Definitely C H E A P, bad quality production, it sounds like it has been recorded under the sea.Unlike Jennifer Lopez's VERY good album."
1,Gisela Uberia,"Bad already released Music, people, this is not RnB, MC is the sweet girl next door who now pretends to have street cred and makes cheap songs by featuring like 200 different artists and never standing by herself, it must be that after her mental breakdown she simply lost her voice and now resorts to lypsynching."
1,Horrible re release,"I can't believe I actually wasted my money on this, the 4 new tracks are horrible, you get a recycled remix of We Belong Together, 2 BAD new tracks and the newest single Don't Forget About Us which sounds like We Belong Together part 2, the song is tanking BIG TIME because of that fact. Mariah is really trying to milk everything she can out of this album, I do love the orginal release and would give that release 4 stars but there is no reason to buy this version if you have the original."
1,"Boring, Dull, Repetitive, all in one giant worthless pack.","The production is bad, the sound quality is VERY-cheap, sometimes you can't hear what MC is pronouncing because of it.Also, it's one giant ball of the same old song from 15 years ago, creativity isn't inside the minde on Boriah Scarey.Buy J'Lo instead. True RnB and hip-hop"
1,J'Lo wannabe,Just an imitator who happens to have a good voice but no talent. Natural qualities don't make the artist.
1,Save your money for the Diamond Edition coming late December,"The Emancipation of Mimi (Limited Diamond Edition) rrp 27.99That's right lambs, don't purchase this ediiton cause there is a spectacular editon being planned, and slated for release on the 27th of December!! I was about to purchase this version, but luckily I read about it on a reliable internet blog. It is rumoured to feature 3 discs, and comes in a box packaging, with a bonus poster and christmas clippings.This is pure heaven for us Mariah fans, and means that this will be a 'diamond' christmas. Yipeeee!!!!"
5,BUY THIS,I will definately buy this.. i love this album so much!!!!!! Its so good to see Mariah back on top of the charts.. its where she belongs!!!
1,Sad...,"I can't believe the music industries is complaining about decline in sales and then pull a stunt like this. What's the purpose of this? To make the listener angry. I do believe that The Emancipation of Mimi - original version is one of Mariah's better album in recent years and I bought that album. However, with this new release it seems like a slap in the face for people who start to believe that she is going in the right direction. The Emancipation of Mimi will be my last album I ever bought from her."
2,Speachless.........,There is really only one terrific song on this album and that is We Belong Together. I was soooo happy when I first heard this because I thought Mariah had returned to her roots. Boy was I let down when all I got was a record filled with rappers on many of the tracks! Stop with the Hip Hop Mariah! It stinks!
1,Shes bigger then ever!,"and I dont mean her career dude! She has gotten thick! Her face is so huge! Either she stuffs it with food or she be taking meds for her sanity and its a side effect. Her music is bad to man. And I agree, Madonna is looking HOT again! Can we say MILF!? peace."
1,Miss Piggy..,"I used to be a Mariah Carey fan. Back in the 90's when she had talent and actually wrote good songs and could still sing. Now she is a fat cow who is as greedy as they come. The idea of releasing an album 4 times and now re-releasing yet again with a third disk of remixes a month after the last re-release?? I remember a time when her remixes were made available on singles for fans to purchase when they were on the radio. Of course that was back in the day when she wasn't a self centered pig who was more interested in sales than in making quality music. She is a fat pig who belongs on the Muppet Show with Kermit the Frog and Gonzo. Mariah, do yourself a favor and go to Jennie Craig with all the extra money you will be sucking out of her stupid Lambs who apparently want to buy any repackaged crap you throw at them. This is pathetic and calculated greed. You have just lost another fan."
5,More Mimi? Yes please.,"first of all, the emancipation of mimi is one of mariah's greatest albums (sales alone can prove that).I think the 4 new tracks (including Dont Forget About Us) actually expands upon the greatness of the regular edition.mimi is back, but who knows for how much longer. i'll take as much mimi as i can get right now!"
1,1 star does not equal to hating or jealousy,"I am a mariah fan I have all her albums but I'm not interested in this one because I already have the original, and someone should have told mariah if it aint broke don't fix it."
1,please make it stop...,"Mariah Carey is already a millionare... why does she have to release this album again? With very few new material...She could have simply released a CD Single for ""Don't Forget About Us"", and it would be better if named ""we belong together - part 2"" or maybe be a little more original and go with ""we still belong together""! Plus having a song only on a CD single, people would buy it a lot! and it would reach #1 on the HOT 100, just like we belong together did...now releasing another version of this album just because of a few more tracks is just low... a cheap attempt to make it bounce back to top 10, so that the new TV ads can say ""after all this time she's still top 10!"" that's CHEAP... LOW...I just wish that she goes back to the days when nobody cared about her and she was a wacko... I actually enjoy her music, we belong together is funky, it's like that is GREAT! but I just don't like her..."
1,The Fat in Mimi's Trunk!!!!,"Mimi has obviously lost the plot, as her record label has just released the following statement regarding the Diamond deluxe edition of this album: 'Whilst we cannot reveal exact details regarding the new edition of Mimi, what we can reveal is that Mariah is working hard on making this release extra special for her fans, as a sort of thank-you for their loyalty and support to her'.If Mimi thinks she is thanking her fans by making them cough up for another edition of this trashy album, then she needs to be locked up in some cave somewhere."
1,Please tell me i'm dreaming!!!!!,"The nerve on this woman. I can't believe that she is seriously going to release a diamond edition of this album in late december, considering she only re-released it 2 weeks ago!!!!! This must set some sought of record, if only one for the most greedy artist in the history of music. Please boycott this release at all costs!!!!"
1,An Ultra-Platinum waste of money,"After purchasing this release, and listening to it, i could not believe I had fallen for the same old industry trap, the 'let's re-release this mediocre album in increase sales' trick. Never has a release been so mechanical and obvious in it's attempt to increase sales for an artist. Mariah is more sickening than usher, in that she tries to pull it off whilst pretending to be genuine. The new single 'Don't forget about us' is as contrived as a song can be, and is a calculated radio hit, with no substance or emotion apparent.Stay right away from this release!!!"
2,Outdated theories make me question this book,"This book is a good read and the author offers up many suggestions for dealing with different types of employees that way well work. However, it was something I read in the opening chapters that concerned me. The author mentions motivation theories, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and the Two Factor Theory (Motivation/Hygiene). Though these factors have been used by practicing managers for a long time (and are quite intuitive), empirical research has found that they are not valid. Though the author never explicitly says that she uses these theories in her recommendations, it casts doubts on her advice. Your mileage may vary on how useful her suggestions are, but I have a hard time trusting the advice of someone who is presenting outdated theories."
2,Anyone ever hear of digital?,"I HATE to give this recording a bad review. The content is excelent, like everything that I have encountered with Jonn Mumford's name on it...but the quality of the recording is SO bad that I can barely understand it. It's hard to follow a guided meditation when you are straining to make out the words. Alas!"
2,only diverts some of the water,"Well, it works as a faucet but the diverter thing, yeah, not so much. Only about a quarter of the water is pushed up into the diverter and the rest continues to come out of the spout. The end result is that there is almost no water pressure coming out of your hand held shower. Too bad because this really would have been great for me sense my tub doesnt have a separate shower and this was going to solve that problem. Oh well, guess I'll keep looking."
4,Hand Held Shower,This works as it should. I was not able to tighten down the connection to the diverter well enough to stop (without fear of stripping threads) a rather noticeable leak along the hose. Hand tight didn't do it. Not a big deal as the water flows into the tub.
3,NO WHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THE CHANEY JR. VERSION! 2 1/2 STARS,"I am a big fan of the Universal classics and have found a place in my heart for the Hammer versions as well. 'The Curse Of The Werewolf is one of the slower paced Hammer productions and we don't get much of the Wolfman until the very end of the film. The make-up is pretty good but, it pales in comparison to Jack Pierce's genius make-up from the 1941 classic 'The Wolfman'. Still, I do like the Werewolf make-up in this dry Lycanthrope tale that strays far from the folklore, as it has become iconic along with the Chaney's version as definitive versions of the creature. This film is being reviewed here on VHS because I watched it on DVD as part of the Hammer Horror series collection including 8 old Hammer classics on a two disc set. The DVD transfers are very good and it is inexpensive. Check it out. I rate this movie at 2 1/2 stars but, it's a lot of fun."
3,it's ok,It's ok for what it was. typical werewolf movie. worth buying if you like this type of movie. Oliver Reed made it worth while. I am glad I got it. It only comes in tape from Amazon so the price is good.
2,"Curse of the Werewolf has all the trappings, but falls shor","This film starts out strong, but ultimately falls short. The introductory legend serves it's purpose in setting up the story, but the film seems to falter afterwards. The film becomes sluggish and the story grows very thin and drawn out in the middle. Eventually, the action picks up for the conclusion, but by this time my interest has faded. The film does have the Hammer trademark colorful costumes and good sets, as well as some very good make-up, but not enough to help a film that looks more like a missed opportunity than anything else."
1,DULL!,"The debut album by this band was alright, but after a few years of touring their schtick has been worn as thin as tracing paper. Put a fork in this band because they are definitely DONE."
4,Underrated,"It appears to me that the reviews below are not representative of all who have read this fine work. While this is not Cobb's best book by any stretch, he does a fine job showing how his process hermeneutic applies to Wesleyan theology. Ask any ten Methodists what it means to be Wesleyan, and you'll likely get several different answers. Cobb finds a way to discern a unifying strand in the possible answers and points it toward mission and practice.With Cobb, what you see is what you get. When his theology has weak spots, he is the first to admit it. What I find in this book is an intellectually honest, faithful, and meaningful approach to what Wesleyanism and how it can be lived out in our current cultural context. Strongly recommended."
4,An excellent book on John Wesley,"John Cobb presents us with an update, modern concept of what Wesley might have thought theologically today. He gives us some possible ways to further the theology of Wesley by being Wesleyan ourselves. I found the book very illuminating, interesting, and helpful in my own studies of John Wesley. Enjoyed it very much. Thank you.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
2,Misses on 'for Today',"Cobb is a process theologian trying to communicate to the reader how Wesley's theology can be relevent today. He's not in his area of specialization in this book and doesn't seem to really want to carry on. I expect that Cobb knows of what he speaks, but the book is burdened with academic language and, in my opinion, missed opportunities at connecting Wesleyen tradition to today. As a well-educated reader with a keen interest in Christianity's search for relevence in today's world, even I had trouble slogging through this one. Your experience may be better than mine, but I would recommend this one only reluctantly. Not an old book, but seems dated."
5,"Outstanding, Hilarious, Heartening. A Must Read!","This is a fabulous collection; a must read! Her insights and perspectives on all six topics entertain you, educate you, challenge you, and empower you! I'd grown up hearing bits and pieces about this ""feminist,"" never understanding (or pursuing) a clearer picture of who she is, what she offers. She is an incredible woman whom I've come to admire, respect and feel tremendous gratitude towards. I've enjoyed all of her books, and especially her audio books, read in her own voice. This book should also be a high school/college reader for young women AND young men! Very enlightening and thought-provoking."
3,Keeping it real.,"Very insightful to woman's issues, and background of why women are where we are at today, the beginning was rough but over all informative."
5,Wonderful Book!,"Gloria Steinem is an amazing author! This is an amazing book and my favorite part is when Gloria turns Freud into a woman. During that chapter, Gloria uses all of Freud's famous theories and turns them against men. Amazing Book! Great Read!"
5,Incredible Book!,"Gloria Steinem challenges us all to redefine our views in her groundbreaking work entitled ""Moving Beyond Words--Breaking the Boundaries of Gender."" Since reading this novel, I was able break the boundaries of my gender and I'm now an ageless, emotionally-tempered, frigid, weak, poor, out-of-shape eunich. Because I'm moving beyond words you'll have to read the rest of my review telepathically."
5,Still true today,"Despite the claims of other reviewers, the evidence that the situation described in Landauer's book has improved since the surge in the internet and its sub-technologies (e.g., the Web) is absent. I'd refer the interested reader to a recent article in the New Yorker entitled ""The Productivity Mirage"" (J. Cassidy) to see some interesting numbers that bear on this question.It's not that IT investment doesn't result in productivity gains for some individuals, but that there's little evidence that it does much for most organizations as a whole. This is a point critics often miss, because most critics are computer-savvy and subjectively feel like they're more productive as a result of their computer use.Most of the problems outlined by Landauer still plague current information systems. This book is a must-read for anyone serious about user interface or IT productivity."
2,Thesis about computers and productivity quickly became false,"This book makes good points about how computer usability problems impact productivity. The author argues that computers had a negative impact on productivity in the years 1973-1993, but misses the idea that these were years of learning to incorporate computer technology deeply into business processes. Four year later, his argument that computers do not have a dramatic and positive impact on economic productivity seems quaint."
2,Save Your Money,"Who in their right mind keyboards a double quote using two single quotes? (For example, ""this"" versus ''this'').Speaking of quotes, I think this quote from page 236 says it all:""Your work may fail to sell for creative reasons or other reasons but it shouldn't fair because of simple things like grammar, punctuation and spelling and/or formatting."""
5,Good up-to-date information,I bought this for my brother who is writing a non-fiction book on WWII and the Marshall Islands and needed some basics. This did a terrific job of providing him with what he needed to be able to submit his manuscript correctly and learn about the business.
2,Disappointed,This is not for the newbie. What was needed was more information for the new writer. Better luck next time
3,"nice, adequate regency","I bought this book due to a glowing review and having never triedFergusonbefore. TBH, this book wouldn't make me go run out and buy her backlist. Itiscompetent, the characters aren't total ninnies (except for one brief TSTLmomentfrom the heroine at the very end), the author knows her regency trappings(except for the growing habit by authors of having their barely introducedregency characters start calling each other by their first names) and theplot isn't way-out-there stupid but....it just didn't light any fires underme."
4,Book review,This is a good reference book for jewelry collectors. Good information on designers & history of jewelry.
2,Index is not accurate; book of no use for research,"I have read this book from cover to cover and have learned a lot. It is well-illustrated, both in color and black-and-white. However, the index is not accurate. It's as if the publisher failed to revise the index prior to publication. For example, the index says that the designer ""Tortolani"" is mentioned on pages 206 and 219. In actuality, this designer is listed on pages 190 and 203. It's the same problem no matter what one looks up. This problem makes the book essentially useless for research. It's informative, but I would advise the buyer to beware if he/she intends to use the book primarily to look up items in the index in order to research particular designers and pieces.<i>This review refers to the June, 1998 edition of this title.</i>"
4,Small stapler,Work well. I have to work on it when a staple gets stuck bot over all it was a good buy. Great for 2 x 2 coin folders..
5,rocks hard!,"on the hamburg dvd, bobby tells that MH doesnt necessarily need 3 guitarists, but points out that 2 strong players will do fine - now for the first time since the early 90s (ingram & duane roland), MH got again 2 strong guitarists...welcome back Dave! that alone justifies this release. however bobby shows clearly that he's still the main man. considering the running time of 80 minutes, i would have left out the guitar + drum solos, and included more songs. Plus, i would have preferred a real guitar battle for ex. in the song Fall of the Peacemakers, like in the good ole days. On Devils canyon, the complete solo features again only Bobby... and i wonder why they added fake crowd noise - that wasnt necessary imo. Anyway, i enjoy the show and i will watch it over & over again! keep rockin, sons of the south!"
5,Loud and Proud!!,"This CD/DVD is a must have for any Hatchet fan, or rock fan for that matter. Blazing twin leads, slide guitar, drum solo, dixie, and the boys in the band having a blast playing live! I had no problem with the DVD picture/sound quality."
5,FROM A MAN'S POINT OF VIEW......,"I found this book when my wife and I were first trying to have a baby. It has proven wonderful time in and time out; It contains more insights and knowledge than other books much larger and less well written. Susun's approach seems to be one of intuitive knowledge, rather than merely intelectual smarts, and that serves we readers so much better. Her explanations of tincture, syrup, and salve preparations are the simplest yet most effective I've found. I wish there was a ""wise man herbal"" out there, well maybe I'll have to write it for all us guys lacking M. Weed's way.A must for every pregnant woman.Realise that every drug is herbal based!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Some Good and some dangerous info,"While there are many good points to this book (red raspberry leaf, for example) there is some outdated and dangerous advice. Rh factor and pre-eclampsia are not best treated with herbs, for example. While one can make the case that modern medicine has many shortfalls, it treats serious diseases quite well. For aches and pains of pregnancy, this book is great. However, for serious conditions, herbs are not much help. Pre-eclampsia can not be treated through diet, for example, and is a very dangerous condition where a woman must be monitored extensively. Saying that diet prevents it is misinformation."
3,"Title should be ""Herbal for Pregnancy and Post Partum""","My wife and I were looking for a book on herbals for our 8 month old daughter. While this book looks like it will be an excellent reference for the next time we are pregnant, it barely touches on herbals for babies and toddlers. We are hoping to find a similar book that covers that topic."
1,dissappointing,"I bought this book, based on the good reviews. However, I was dissappointed by the impracticality of some of the advise, e.g. St. Joan's wort. To have this oil, you are supposed to pick the flowers in June, store them for months, prepare them and then you have the oil to use! Also it advises stretching, exercising etc. that is all very well if you have a ""normal"" pregnancy. I enjoy living a healthy organic lifestyle, however, this book is too ""mother-earth"" for me."
1,Bad advice that can cause your child danger!,"This book is giving mis-information about the treatment of newborn jaundice. Susan Weed, the author, does not have a high school education - she is not knowledgeable on the subject which she is giving advice when it comes to the treatment of newborn jaundice. Her advice to use sunlight, as a natural cure can result in the infants death. I have not read other chapters of this book, but would advise that if the information she gives is similar to the advice given in the treatment of jaundice - then you could be risking your child's life. Read her bio at the amazon authors website and buy at your own risk!"
1,Off the cuff health advice is dangerous,"While Susan Weed covers a great many topics and remedies in this book, she doesn't cover any of them with enough detail. She leaves out warnings, indications and rational for many of her reprinted remedies. This book is only150 pages, but should be 3 times that considering the number of topics that she covers. For example she says that ""excess vitamin C"" is a Teratogen. Well, how much vitamin C, when and why? Things listed as teratogens are listed as cures later in the book (ex. caster oil). Overall, this book left me confused and frustrated with more questions than answers. This is the kind of book that gives herbal self-medicating a bad name."
5,This book is AMAZING!,"This is a wonderful book... it's concise and to the point... true, it doesn't go into a lot of detail about why things are or aren't good to take, but that info is easily researched... I like that it tells you what to do or not to do in short simple ways... makes it SOOOOOO much easier to find the information I want and need.Throughout this pregnancy my blood pressure has been on the high side... after only a few days of following the cream of tartar protocol (pg 47) my blood pressure is now down to PERFECT!!! This book has greatly improved my health... I recommend it to EVERYONE!"
2,Not enough maps and photos,"I was a little disappointed by this book, for there are less maps and photos than I expected. It is unlikely for ""Eyewitness Travel Guides."" I usually believe maps will be greatly appreciated especially for small towns which don't have the tourist information center. However, I appreciate the concept that this publisher makes this regional guidebook, so I give one start for it. Another star is for the reasonable price at Amazon.com: $13.60 (regular $20) as of 11/3/2006."
2,Look elsewhere for info on Cinque Terre,"I was so disappointed--Eyewitness books are usually so good. But we're going to Cinque Terre, and there was almost no information on it--just a quick overview and map, nothing about hotels or restaurants or sights (other than that the scenery is beautiful. I already knew that.)"
1,The Wrong Title For This Doll,"I think Mattel picked the wrong title for this doll.I think of Princes Bride the movie when I hear the phrase ""Prices Bride"".The idea behind the doll is great as is the doll itself, but the name makes it sound like a movie collectabel. I would love to see a Barbi and Ken style Princes Bride movie toys. If you catch my drift Mattel. ; )"
5,we got f*cked up. Then things got f*cked up -jon gibbions,"The boys and gal from bardo do it yet again. Dropping a slab of brillant sonic sludge. ""Walking Stick Man"" is reminicent of there early bluesy stuff. Isobel plays violine instead of the flute. They have also added another drummer and a harmonica to the mix. Joe Culver is still in the band and his drumming is as brilliant as allways. There is also Ed Farnsworth on drums his style is a little more straight forward but still great. Brothers Mike and Jon's guitar work is more spacy and dense. The violine is a great new sound for the band. I do wish there was still a flute. ""AGain"" is a real rocker in a Dead C kinda way. Isoble's vocals is as incomprahensibal as ever and thats why we all love her. Clint and joe still provide the structure for the waves of noise to live in. When we look back at the 1990's Bardo Pond has proved to be one of the most interesting bands this decade has produced."
3,Good and interesting for Kung Fu aficionados and entertaining for fans of Southern Cops,"This DVD has a Brian Dennehy movie about the trouble a southern sherriff goes through to maintain order in his town. Then there is The Real Bruce Lee.This movie is a compilation of some of Bruce Lee's stuff. The first part is a narrative with excerpts from four of Bruce Lee's early movies from his youth. Then there is a quick biography of Bruce, followed by a lot of clips of his immitaters. Then there is the better part of a movie from hies newest immitater, Dragon Lee.And you're being ripped off if you buy it for however much these guys are selling it used. You can get this movie new at your local dollar store."
5,Great book !!,"A great book on a difficult subject.Having married a Tica, I can suggest this humorous book to anyone interested in the ways of a Costa Rican woman."
4,Great ring at a great price,This is quite a beautiful and unusual ring. My wife works in a hospital where the soap was causing discomfort around her wedding ring. I wanted to get a ring to wear as a wedding band (without worrying about losing it) at the hospital. She loves it and wears it more than her actual wedding ring. The ring was exactly as descrbed. I am considiring getting one for myself as well.
1,Very cheap!,"I bought this for my husband to match mine & to replace his older ring which was worn. The band that spins broke after only a couple days of him wearing it. Nice idea, but cheap & complete garbage."
4,the ring,"Unusual Spinning Sterling Silver Celtic Claddagh Spin Worry Band Ring Size 10(Size 5,6,7,9)wouldn't spin had to fix"
4,Good quality cable,The 100ft UXGA HD15 cable looked and felt sturdy and had a quality feel. The powerpoint presentation on on the screen 85ft away from the computer was great.
3,good cable,Seems like a well made cable and works fine. The only complaint I have is the outer jacket of the cable is a stiff plastic that is difficult to coil and doesn't easily lay flat when uncoiled. Would not be a problem in a permanent install but I am using it for a portable setup so coiling it up is difficult and when laying it out its hard to tape it down smoothly on the floor. For my use when it needs to be replace I will look for a different cable with a softer flexible outer jacket.
4,ATTENTION BUYERS!!!!!,"Everything on here is available on the ACME delux 2 disc reissue or the download version. Save some do re mi, $$$$, moolah , dont buy this."
3,A Separate Peace is hard to understand.,"A Separate Peace was difficult for me to understand because it takes a path deep in to a teenager's mind. You see the pains, successes, and problems of the main character's life."
2,Not Satisfied.,"The crib came damaged and since im due any day now I had no choice but to keep it. One of the drawers was broken, another piece had a huge crack, and extra holes needed to be drilled because they were missing! A metal part that is for the drawer to slide was completely bent out of shape so now I have an uneven drawer that gets stuck. Needless to say I wont order on Amazon again after this. I almost cried when I saw all the damage. =( Also its ALOT smaller then I thought."
4,pretty good,"When I started ""teaching"" myself guitar, I bought ""Fretboard Roadmaps"", and used it for some worthwhile learning of MY fretboard! Now I buy F.M. Blues, and was a little surprised and yeah, a little frustrated because it almost is the exact same book! Although it does have a CD, which IS needed in every book on guitar! It does make sense to those who haven't read the F.R. series. It's definately not a bad book, but I thought he could have veered a little away from the original F.R. book to actually show how different the blues are to rock and whatnot.This is not a cut-down of the book by any means and unlike others, I believe this IS a book for beginners. Do what I did when I was a beginner, skip chapters you don't get, and come back to them later."
5,"Very, very Helpful","Instructive, easy to understand and use, not just for beginners, fun. Really is very, very helpful. Buy it ! You'll like it !"
4,It's time to move ahead,"All I know about the blues, I've learned from the writer. I know a little and many assume that I know a lot. I can't wait until I can really dive into this book."
2,did not love this one,"We got this as a gift for my daughter's first birthday and put it together right away. After following the directions closely, the handlebars came out really wobbly. They turn left to right, but don't control the wheels. They also wiggle up and down quite a bit. The age on this product was 12-36 mo. but I wouldn't let my 2 yr old on it because it seemed that the handlebars would come apart. We took it apart assuming we did something wrong, but it went back together the same way and still has the same wobbly handles. I wouldn't buy it."
5,exc read,The Prodigal Wife by Susan FoxLainey and Gabe were married almost five years ago. In his will her fatherhad a stipulation that she had to marry him. When her mother died her willstated she could get the inheritance if she stayed married to Gabe for fiveyears. They never even spent a night together since they got married.He's lived on the ranch and brought it back to what it was once known for.They spend a lot of time together on the ranch and get to know one anotheragain.
5,Brings back my childhood awe of space,"I will always remember being in awe of the starry sky and watching the stars with my old Saturn telescope in the country. I had a couple of old star maps and a tickling feeling inside my chest. Listening to Eno and Fripp is probably as close to that experience as I can get now. It doesn't have the syropy sci-fi feel of a Discovery program, just the basic, raw awe that every human has when looking at the stars above on a clear night. One of the best."
3,You Can't Go Home Again,"Track five of this album consists of some muted bell-tones over a vague, rumbling bottom. It sounds for all the world like the soundtrack to ""Blade Runner"" during Decker's exploration of the Bradbury Hotel.Which kinda explains a lot. The Bradbury, once a grand hotel, has fallen into disrepair and is now inhabited by various low-life squatters. This is exactly the situation of Fripp & Eno's groundbreaking loop-based ambient music from the seminal ""No Pussyfooting"" and ""Evening Star"" albums -- once stunning and innovative, now a little shabby and disreputable.Oh, Bob & Brian give it a go and almost make the paradigm modern again with some digital treatments and sounds, but I couldn't help that shuddery feeling that it was only new wallpaper over a crumbled edifice."
3,Fantastic background music,Ambient sounds are presented here in a rich tapestry where these two profound influences on music get together and sort of noodle in an offsetting rythem. The noises of Fripp are familiar; no speed playing; and at times only one finger sliding along the frets answering to Eno's etherial synthetic sound. This CD can make you feel richer and you can visualize the cover blue as a matching sensation to the well-recorded sound of this album. Recommended as backgroud to computer work or avante garde cocktail party.
2,a let down,"doesn't even come close to the heights set by no pussyfooting and evening star. at best, wispy ambient music for video games or sci-fi tv shows."
2,Is this all they've got?,"Man, is this boring. Even as background music, it's a snooze. Evidently they've both used up all the ideas they had, and had nothing better to do other than lay down some tracks in their sleep."
4,Where does one goe for unbias answers,"This is well organized and informative and has some strong suggestions which would have a lot of people jump on board. But on the other side is Penn & Teller, my question is then where do you go for unbiased answers to these questions. I wish I knew where to get them.........."
5,Great information,This video contains excellent information. It explains clearly why most medical doctors do not talk about healthy diet and it's effect on health. It gives the public hope for a healthier future and encourages everyone to take action and take controll of their own health.
3,Some Good Information but Could be Better,"Lots of good information in this movie but, sadly, the best alternative therapy isn't represented. Instead, there is more of an emphasis on people who support eating vegetarian and eating raw. I learned the hard way that those diets aren't optimal for everyone (ie. me). I did the Gerson Therapy for two years and my disease didn't regress - it held stable and I was tired all day long. I then switched to the Gonzalez protocol and my disease is melting away. You may learn more about my experience at http://curingmyeloma.blogspot.com/ and please feel free to contact me with questions."
5,A big eye opener & Lifestyle changer!,"I first saw The Future of Food which got me started on a personal quest to see how much healthier I can be and how much more aware I can be of what I'm eating.This movie really helped reinforce that desire! There were facts stated that I vaguely remember my Mother & Father & others making random statements on when I was little. This showed me that they weren't the only ones stating the facts. Now, I scrutinize almost everything before I buy it & have altered my diet to dramatically include much more raw fruits & vegetables. The cacao beans are a bit tough for starters but they slowly grow on you. Lol.This movie really opened me up to a whole new & better world as I hope it does for countless others too!"
5,Take this documentary to heart,"This documentary spoke to me. I am in my fourth year of studying dietetics. My father is a M.D. and he practices age management. He's told me for years now how important a healthy diet, exercise, and vitamins are. He owned his own vitamin store and all of his patients are a testament to what vitamins can do for someone. Anyone who says this documentary is BS is not educated on the subject. We came from eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables that grew in nutrient-rich soil. Nutrients DO get cooked out of fruits and vegetables. I learn this in school, not from some kook. It is best to eat organic raw fruits and vegetables and lots of them. Vitamins make up for the deficiency of nutrients in the soil. If you want to learn more about it go to synergistichealthcenters.com. That's my dad's website. He can talk to you more if you are still doubtful."
1,Rhetoric,"This movie is a piece of rhetoric on behalf of vitamin therapy. It proceeds to straw man what it depicts as a failed health and food system while offering a poorly substantiated alternative as a panacea.This is not to say that actual vitamin deficiencies don't exist or that there are not any problems with the current food and medical system: this movie simply exacerbates and completely misconstrues the nature of the problem so that you will be susceptible to naturopathic quackery. Don't fall for it. The film also fails to back up its claims for vegetarianism. Most importantly, the film does not provide any scientific evidence for pervasive vitamin deficiencies in the general population. If that were the case, it should be measurable."
1,DVD did not work,Could not get the DVD to work. Will have to send back and get a replacement. I hope it works
3,Contains easily obtained information.,Though this DVD was pretty good I was disappointed in the information provided. I thought it would be more involved. I didn't really learn anything from it but I have been researching so maybe it would be good for most people.
2,Cooked Food Bad For You?,This doc. was so biased I could hardly stand to watch it. I am a Nutritionist and have read several studies contradicting their statements. One of the most shocking things were when they said cooked food is bad for you....Nonsense
5,Worth watching!,"For anyone interested in taking charge of their own health, this is worth watching. Very interesting information and it really makes you reconsider how to move through life with an interest in living"
5,"Clear, concise and informative","What a great movie to provide pertinent information in such a clear way, and at the same time not take itself too seriously. Every interview is great! I bought this to share with my patients, friends and family. A must see for everyone!!"
5,Must Watch!!!!,Anyone who cares about their health should watch this movie!! It really makes you think about every little thing you put into your body. It is very informative and I highly recommend watching it.
5,great movie to watch,This movie was very eye opening and had a lot of information in it. It really makes you think twice about the diet that you grew up on and what it is doing to your health. I would suggest this movie to anyone that is interested in learning about making a change in their life. There are a lot of interesting stories about what people have been able to accomplish and even defeat by just changing their diet. It is definitely a must see
2,I'm a believer in nutrition for healing - and this film pissed me off...,"I'm all about food as medicine - I go to an naturopathic doctor, my husband is a physician, my career is devoted to getting solid nutrition in the mouths of children and youth, I pick up most of my food from farms or farmer's markets - I soak my grains, I make food from scratch, etc...okay, having said this - I hated this film. I have a history in research and the research in this film was subpar. I was on their side and they turned me off with their pseudo-experts and their over-the-top opinions. ""Forks over Knives"" is a much better resource on this matter. Another reviewer said it well - ""this is not a Michael Pollan book - this is not Food, Inc., this is a conspiracy theory sales pitch."" I encourage you to watch it and see - take it all in with a grain of salt."
2,"Misleading Title, Disappointing Film","I bought this film expecting something about food quality and how it affects our health. Instead, I watched a documentary about vitamins. And while I support some of the ideas presented, there was a heavy vegetarian bias throughout and little about food itself. I also became annoyed after a while with the some of the people the filmmakers chose to interview, as they became repetitive and were on screen too often."
5,brilliant and timely,"As a certified holistic nutritionist, I can say this DVD is dead on. I have a number of clients who have been healed of cancer with mega doses of Vitamin C. Unlike Food, Inc. and other DVD's that choose to shock or scare one into better eating, this film does it with facts and stories. It doesn't aim to scare or shock, merely inform. It's a MUST for anyone who is interested in living a longer, healthier life. I also showed this to four of my college level classes--students who did not sign up for a nutrition class. It motivated many of them to move to a healthier lifestyle. Now THAT is powerful!"
2,Not really about food.,"There was a little talk about our food supply at the start of the video. After that it was all about vitamins and the Gerson method, which was never actually explained. I didn't find it very informative, and I am skeptical because there weren't a lot of studies referenced in support of their claims."
4,Food Matters Review,The DVD was very informative and I've passed it around to my family members for them to watch. It has prompted me to make some changes in my eating habits and to want to learn more about the importance of taking vitamins.
3,good but could be better,This was enjoyable but did not have as much specific information as I expected. It lacked detail about how to improve diets for health
2,There's much better info out there - this is outdated,"While the basic premise of this film is fine (it's best to eat fresh, organic, locally grown produce), I was surprised to see that this film had been made so recently; so much of the information is outdated and totally unsupported by current research. Also, the presentation is just plain dull -- a lot of talking heads. The people who are interviewed are for the most part self-appointed experts without credentials, and the claims they are making are either vastly oversimplified, stuff that everybody knows, or in the worst cases, very misleading. Do yourself a favor and get some credible nutrition information. For starters, ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"" and anything written by Michael Pollan or Mark Bittman is worthwhile (Bittman has a superb lecture on TED.com about the impact that factory farming is having on the planet)."
3,To poop is to live,"This is a run-of-the-mill promotion of nutritional medicine, but still a dubious push in favor of buying vitamins, juicers and organic foods from organizations whose quest for profits are as unsavory as those of the pharmaceutical corporations that are demonized in this documentary. Whatever issues exist with the health and wellness industry, it remains arguable that people today are dying too soon."
2,"Watch Food, Inc. instead.","FoodMatters is deficient of science. The interviewees in this film all make broad claims about the superior abilities of high doses of vitamins, raw foods, and vegetarianism, however, the film does not present the hard science behind these claims. If the film had perhaps shown me HOW high doses of vitamin C improve cancer, I might not have given the film 2 stars. I agreed with the basic message of the film -- that we are too reliant upon pills and that nutrition should be the solution rather than an afterthought. Yet the film focuses far more attention on vitamins that real, whole foods.This film feels like poorly directed propaganda rather than a true documentary."
1,Food Matters should be titled Vitamins Matter,"I was very disappointed in this video, in fact I returned it. It is not what it says it is; only about 10% to 20% of the content is about food. This is a pro-vitamin video! Although it features David Wolf and Gerson's daughter, their part is extremely short. At least 80% of Food Matters is about vitamins. There is alot of controversy these days about vitamins; not everyone believes that they help."
5,becca0509,This video gives you PHENOMENAL information about the importance of the foods we eat and is definitely enlightening into the reasons society is getting more and more sick. I've seen this video three times and still realize something new each time.
3,Interesting viewpoint,"Video was informative but I wouldn't take the subject matter as gospel. It is an opinion and and interesting one. The video itself is very long and after half an hour, you kind of tune out. If you are looking for an alternative to the way you are living now, it is a way to go. I think it was overpriced, but I'm cheap so don't go by me."
1,Try something else,"I bought this progarm, and returned it after a few days. The program is loaded with bells and whistles, none of which are helpful. This is not a good program if you are learning Spanish. I notice that the only positive review is from someone who aready spoke Spanish when he bought the program. This makes sense as the program is absolutely worthless to the student begining to study Spanish. I agree with most of the others who reviewed this program. There is no real attempt to teach the language. The program is simply a vast collection of material designed to test your knowledge of Spanish, not to teach it. The program is selling the sizzle, not the steak as they say."
3,Not Quite as Bad as it First Seems,"After opening this product and finding no manual to tell me where to start I was about ready to take the disks out in the yard and break them. After I got disk 1 loaded I found it was not for beginners. Without prior knowlege of Spanish you can't even get started. I read a review (on Amazon.com) that said Rosetta Stone was the best program and found out that the #7 ""Spanish Plus"" disk is produced by Rosetta Stone. This is the beginners disk, disk #7. Who woulda thunk it? With this I was able to begin learning simple words and phrases and eventually move up to the other disks.My question is: Why don't they have instructions that tell beginners to start with disk 7. The program is OK..."
2,Good pronunciation section; horrible layout,"This series would be ok for practicing and learning pronunciation, BUT the whole layout of the software is EXTREMELY confusing.Even worse, most of the vocabulary used in the lessons aren't even in the glossary, which really confuses you.So, only buy this CD if you want to practice pronunciation. DO NOT buy it if you're starting from scratch, and don't have any foundation in grammar or vocabulary."
1,Huge Disapointment,"All in all I am very displeased with this product. It was very hard to use at first and from a learning standpoint it was ineffective. Your best bet is to check out a product called Spanish Now by a company called Transparent Language, they seem to have the best software available for language learning."
1,Nearly worthless,"You'll pick up some words. But thats about it.IF you want to learn a foreign language, just buy some audio CD's, a dictionary, a newspaper of the language and some videos/dvd movies/tv shows that speak the foreign language.All the software I've ever tried is completley worthless by itself. But it's a decent supplement.By the way, the CD roms aren't even filled up all the way. 1 and a half worth of cd info and stretched it across 7 CD's to make it look big."
2,Hard to figure out...not good for beginners,"This was fairly easy to install. The lessons are for people who know basic Spanish. If you have a tutor, then this is good to use accompanying what you are learning, but this is not recommended for people who don't have the basics. If you are really planning to learn, get a tutor or buy the Rosetta Stone Spanish Explorer."
1,Worth what we paid - nothing,"This program, which claims to be WIndows XP compatible, is nothing more than a Windows 95 program. It would not install into the Program Files directory until I used the Progra~1 form. Next, when the program launched, it resized my screen to EGA resolution - yes, this program is THAT old. Finally, it claimed it couldn't fidn the CD even though it had just been installed from that CD.As the title said, it is worth exactly as much as we paid - nothing."
1,Not that great of a book.,"This book is very wierd. I don't think it tells very much about spells. If you want to read this book, don't buy it. I suggest that you go to the library if you are interested in it."
2,Disappointing,"This book is called Fairy Spells, leading one to believe that the book has, well, fairy spells. There are only about two passages that might be construed as spells, and they are badly constructed and far too cumbersome to be of any use. The information on fairies was a rehash of 18th century poets and didn't bring anything new or interesting to the subject.The pictures were lovely, and the poetry was very nice, so it gets two stars for that. But to be honest, I got more relevant information about fairies from the movie Fairy Tale, and that was not the best of movies.If you like poetry and general information on fairies, than this is a good book for you. But the book is called Fairy Spells and just doesn't live up to the title. Anyone who actually wants to connect with the fairy realm would do much better to turn to just about anything written by the Frouds and leave this overpriced nicely illustrated book on the shelves."
3,"A Wonderfully Illustrated, But Confused Work.","This work is a wonderfully illustrated epistle on the subject of Fairies, the Little Ones from the Astral Realm that can influence our lives for the better.However, the author of this work appears to be very confused in her theology, insisting on the Christian and Pagan theologies' dual validity in an effort to support her theories. This is simply a metaphysical impossibility.Given the wonderful artwork in this work, I recommend it as a book for the art lover; however, I do not recommend it for any serious study of Pagan theology, metaphysics, of the Fairies themselves.Blessed Be and May The Light Of The Goddess Shine Upon You All.Love and Light,TRISTON JAY AMERO"
2,Beautiful but Strange,"The pictures in this book are lovely, and it's well put together, but the information in it is even more fruit-loopey than most fairy books, and she has a strange view of light vs. dark. I found it slightly disturbing and wasn't expecting it in this book."
5,Perfect,It's really a very very useful tool for the people who want to master ASP.NET through specific examples. The book works like you have a live teacher who understands your thoughts and questions. The writting is extremely clear and focuses on what you expect to learn. I know Ken from the past (I own all Acces Dev. Hand Book series) and Paul from Access VB Adv. Mag. Here simply they continue a successful tradition. Congratualtions!
5,"A ""must-have"" book","Having written in 3 books and published hundreds of times, i never thought i'd write one of these amazon.com reviewer things. but, having read paul sheriff and ken getz's book i can tell you that this is a must for beginners and savvy .net developers alike. there are 300+ books published on .net. i bet i have 30 of them. but, this book is top 5. it is really well layed out and covers a main theme (ie: application) and takes it through a lifecycle. it has just enough referency stuff too."
4,Flambeau Outdoors Tackle Box,"It is a little heavy and big. However, it holds everything and is set up nice. Made well and sturdy."
1,No backup on the guarantee if it doesn't work - Uriflow,"Obtained 6 bottles on September,2009 and used it as indicated. It did nothing for my kidney stones as confirmed by a CT scan. The bottles were returned and followup with phone calls got promises of a refund. Never got back a cent. I highly question the validity of claims made and integrity of the manufacturer. Beware. jdev-"
1,Did not work,"I used the entire bottle while drinking a lot of water. Unfortunately, I still have the stone. Glad it worked for others, as I know your pain."
1,uriflow doesn't work,"Hello,I have used this product for awhile. I notice no change. I believe that uriflow I have purchase is a placebo not the real thing. I think I have wasted my money on this product. I would never buy any uriflow again. I wish this product have worked...so I can be comfortable.Steven"
1,If only my stone would go where my money went...,"I am a physician, a radiologist, to be specific. So it is easy for me to keep an eye on my stones. Five weeks ago, via a quick CT scan, I found a 5mm stone in my left ureter. It was not causing an obstruction (yet), so I wasn't forced to do anything urgently. With an open mind, I spent the $40 for a bottle of Uriflow capsules. I took two a day for a month, and this morning I jumped back on the CT scanner. The stone is still there, completely unchanged. Is it possible that someone with different body chemistry might benefit from this preparation? Yes, it's possible, but for most of you I seriously doubt it. Instead, I recommend that you put that $40 a month into an account to save up for your co-payment for cystoscopy and/or lithotripsy."
4,Uriflow,"Too early to rate this product, but I can say it makes me pee more often, and that must be good, right?"
4,This is a good product,I like this product. It works well and is a good value for the money. Makes my kidney's feel better.
4,Satisfied,"After three trips to the ER suffering from kidney stones, I sought out all the reviews I could on this and similar products. I am not a medical expert. However, my scans revealed I had three stones of the same size remaining. Using Uri-Flow daily, one stone passed as tiny grains of sand with little discomfort. A year later, the other two remain in my kidney but have lessened in size. It may be a coincidence, but I have handled my kidney stone problem with far less discomfort and anxiety while taking Uri-Flow (I take one daily in the morning)."
5,Heywood Is Genius,I've read every Heywood Gould book. They're all great and hilarious. But this one strikes true to the troubles that go on in mixed raced neighborhoods that see madness everyday.
5,Really liked this book,"Well, I just read part of the 1 star review, and frankly I'm surprised.I have now about 5 pie books, as it's been a recent obsession of mine, and I really like this book.I've made about 7 different pie recipes from this book alone, and they've been winners.Just last weekend I made 2 types (3 pies) using the all butter crust recipe, and I made the apple-pear and the brown sugar apple, and they came out flawless.Also, I done graphic design for a living in college, and I find the way the book is laid out quite easy to read and informative. I liked it so much I bought a copy for my kindle fire so I could have the recipe book with me when visiting a friend's house (and making pie from his apple trees).I think you should take a look, and judge for yourself, but to have even compiled and made recipes for 300 pies, it's quite impressive."
5,"Making pies can be ""as easy as pie.""","I've enjoyed the author's previous cookbooks, but this is definitely one of the best. His pie crust directions -the part most cooks find trickiest - are very clear and really work. I especially like the food processor instructions which enable you to produce an excellent pie crust in minutes. The recipes are delicious and include a wonderful variety. Today we're enjoying the Peanut Butter Cheesecake Pie with a Sour Cream-Brown Sugar topping, and it is every bit as delicious as it sounds. We've also had several of the fruit pies, and they were all very tasty. If you love pies, you'll want this book."
5,"Comprehensive, inspirational, practical","I received this book several years ago as a gift, and unlike many cookbooks that I own, I have only gotten more fond of it as time has passed. The recipe for basic pie crust is my go-to recipe, and I have found it to be nearly infallible. And the recipes span every possible type of pie from a traditional apple to more the off-beat and unusual. This is a book for both a beginner and an experienced pie baker. There is something here for everyone."
4,Country Apple Crumb Cake,"I just tried one of the recipes [...] developed by ken. First of all, the recipe is quite unique and delicious. for a second, I think, it's quite universal. As for me, I will try to make it again and use another fruit. Definitely, I would like to read ken's book. I'm hooked up with his creativity."
4,"Good, but wish it had more traditional recipes","I think this book has some great recipes, however, I feel that this book lacks some traditional/basic pie recipes that you would expect this book would have. It would have been nice if some recipes had instructions to make them more basic. Ex. I see Blackberry-Cherry Double Crust pie, but how about instructions for adapting it to make a simple Blackberry pie.There are a few that I can't imagine ever making - - like Spiced Parsnip pie, or Pear and Jalapeno Jelly pie, or Sweet Avocado Cream Cheese pie. But there are lots of gems here too.Overall worth the purchase."
4,sad face,"it did not come,i was so sad.really hoped that no one would have to go thur this .dont know why,still its not on my wall.you only can brun my once"
3,Not beginner material,"I was very excited about this software since I come to Italy alot, and I am starting in a class this summer.However after using the program for several hours, I found that it is not near beginner level. It has many good features, but I could not find some REALLY basic in the software.I think this software is a blast after taking a crash course in Italien, and will look forward to that, but do not expect to speak Italien after playing around with this software if you have no experience with the language what so ever."
1,Terrible beyond parole,Italian Pro should be entitled Italian amateur. It is gimmicky and useless whether you already know Italian and want to brush up on it or are new. It is all bells and whistles and no substance.
1,Not for a beginner!,"It took a while to learn how the software works. Also, I don't know any Italian and find that this product is beyond the beginner level! I don't even know where to begin. I thought it would teach you how to pronounce vowels and things like that first and the move to words and finally sentences. This product starts you off with full sentences."
1,"Terrible, confusing...","Had no idea what to do, and I am an experienced computer user. You don't know in what order to start the lessons... if I started at the beginning, then it is MUCH too difficult. I had no idea what anyone was saying and no way to find out. Simply a dreadful program!"
5,What you people think PRO means?,"I think people doing the reviews about this product can mislead the opinion of customers when it comes the time to make a decision and buy.First this product name is ITALIAN PRO, obviously it's not for first time learning italian students, the software has an autorun program, that means that you set the disc in the drive and starts by itself, I don't see many computer knowledge in that. Believe my word I'm already studying the basic italian program, in fact the name is just ITALIAN that's why now I'm looking the PRO version.Well I think the program is really good, there are audio complementary discs also, so with this you can round very well your learning, finally the discs can be used for english, spanish, english, and I think french speakers too. ARRIVEDERCI"
5,A time travel that sweeps you back to medieval Scotland.,"Sandy Blair creates a tale that makes you believe time travel is possible. Beth Pudding conquers time travel, two foreign language deficits and a ghost/Laird in medieval Scotland. Duncan McDougal is a man for the ages, fighting for his people and the love of a ""wee bit daft"" woman. Blair captures your imagination on the first page and doesn't let loose until the final page of the epilogue. If you love Scotish historicals, paranormals and witty dialogue, you'll love this book."
3,Good story........,"Sandy Blair's ""A Man in a Kilt"" was a good and quick read. While I enjoyed the story, I do have some issues with her writing. The main one is that the woman is writing about Scotland, but chooses not to research how to properly spell place names such as STIRLING and CULLODEN. Another issue is that although she references Diana Gabaldon's truly amazing ""Outlander"" series, she neglects to spell the one and only JAMIE FRASER's name correctly. If you're going to reference a much beloved character of a much beloved author, please take the time to get it right! All in all, it was good and I'll probably read the second one as well, ""A Rogue in a Kilt,"" quite frankly because...let's be honest...it involves a Scottish Highlander! Oh and the fact I still have to wait another three months for Diana Gabaldon's new book, ""A Breath of Snow and Ashes."""
2,Leaves Much to Be Desired,"Interesting concept, but weak dialog between characters, much of which borders on the absurd, overall lack of depth, real passion and writing skill. For a far better read of a tantalizing scottish hero, read Jackie Ivie's debut ""Lady of the Knight""."
3,Fast paced trendy tour of New York,"Don't try to take this tour without additional instructions or a map. It missed some of the classic places (Ferry boat, Statue of Liberty)"
1,Worked fine for two years but....,"I have this dehumidifier, but under the Kenmore brand- but it looks exactly the same. It worked like a charm for about two years, but then suddenly stopped working. From the Sears website (where we bought ours) I discovered that many people had the same experience- after two years the dehumidifier stopped working. My husband has tinkered with it several times- the fan works, we gave the filter and ""insides"" a thorough cleaning, but the coils ice up and now my husband thinks that the coolant is not properly circulating.Like I said, it worked wonderfully for a while and made a huge difference in our basement, but from what I can gather from Internet searches, it should have had a longer lifespan."
2,Excellent short term machine,"It worked very well for the first year and half. All it is good for now is zapping electricity, that's it. I let it run for a while only to find the bucket completely empty. I am going to buy a new one but will not waste my money on this"
5,money always affects the ratings,"This set gets 5 stars for the price tag. However, its got a lot going for it in other ways too. Great packaging, great bands, expansive variety, solid tunes. One draw back: this is not a 10 year retrospective. Its a compilation to promote the latest recordings of the label. But that's OK. Music is a product that is sold shamelessly so bite the hook and enjoy some good music. Consolation prize for Matador fans: the 3rd CD offers unreleased cuts from various Matador darlings."
3,A good sampler to remind you why you love or hate this label,"I picked this up to remind myself what all these Matador bands sounded like. A lot of my friends were fans of this label, buying anything they released, so I was exposed to Pavement, Guided By Voices, Cornelius and others on many a road trip or while hanging out and drinking beers. Good times.Matador offers a diverse mix of bands to choose from, the price of this 3 disc set is relatively cheap, so you'll likely find something to like or love. It's a good introduction to a great label."
5,Great music for really cheap,The tracks on this look like a collage radio play list!!!!! You got THE best in underground rock/Folk/Pop all in One cd. If YOU like good underground (Not that stuff that passes for rock these days) Then buy this.
4,Matador does another one,"As a follow up to the first Everything is Nice - this newest of Matador compilations features some pleasant new music to enjoy. Running the spectrum from Pavement with two quite nice songs (including an alternate version of Grounded which is, in many ways, better than the original) to the always pleasing Boards of Canada hit Roygbiv and the flash in the pan Burger/Ink - there is almost certainly something for everyone here. And with three discs for under twenty dollars, it's hard to go wrong with this purchase. I could have done without some of the Arab Strap and Bardo Pond songs - but once again, something for everyone."
4,A great sampler for a great price.....everything is nice...,"Three CD's with some of the most interesting bands from the last decade....Pavement, of course, JSBE, Mogwai (""X-Mas Steps"" great track that...try listening to this when it's raining...), Chavez, Guided by Voices, Yo La Tengo, Sleater-Kinney(who are on Matador in Europe...)and more. But it's the ones who maybe have not exploded over in these states yet that are surprising...namely, Unwound (okay, yes, so maybe they are now making a name for themselves...with a dangerously weird track with growled wordless vocals), Cat Power (both tracks awesomely sparse and haunting...), Solex (Dutch version of Pizzicato 5 maybe?), Bardo Pond (weaving and crunching guitars in a sea of noise...brilliant and groovy...)and of course, the goofy and genius Lynnfield Pioneers (shades of 60's meltdown, funk and god knows what else...). Get it-- it's cheap and it's genius."
4,Wonder? Breed? How Foul is your Seed??,"What to expect from ""The Mammoth Book of Awesome Comic Fantasy""--a mosaic of waggish rogues and wayward wizards, misinformed planet-skippers, and would-be assassins in the grain...and from the skies. I recommend reading the book starting with the hyperactive final tale, ""You'll Never Walk Alone Again""; its frenetic rhythm demands your perception be sharply angled! ""Put Down that Universe!"" is the second-to-last tale and features characters equally extraordinary and intriguing. Other meritorious additions: ""Dragonet"", ""Nothing in the Rules"", ""How Much Would You Pay?"",""Math Takes a Holiday"", ""Polly Put the Mockers On"", and ""The Absolute and Utter Impossibility of the Facts in the Case of the Vanishing of Henning Vok""...On the flip side, skip ""Ferdie"", ""Milord Sir Smiht..."", ""Touched By a Salesman"", ""The Swords and the Stones"", ""Fair Weather Fiend"" and ""Mother Duck Strikes Again"". TEDIOUS!! Overall, great book..."
1,One more in a series of ... books,"What is with these British anthologizers? How perverse a talent it is to find short, comedic stories which are not funny. Sweet merciful heavens this guy found a John Cleese story that was tedious. Imagine how hard you must work to find a tedious John Cleese anything. At least in this volume you can tell that most of the authors were trying to be at least a little funny."
1,And everyone else,"Cool! Now can we have a book ""Whites are stupid, throw rocks at them."" ""Blacks are stupid, throw rocks at them."" ""Jews are stupid, throw rocks at them."" ?Thought not.Wonder why?Maybe it's because hate is hate, and teching girls that their insecurity is really hate and hate is OK, is REALLY stupid.(Oh yes, boys are insecure too, as are blacks, jews, whites, conservatives, liberals, gays etc - and that insecurity doesn't justify any of their hate either).Quentin"
1,Pretty disgusting in a very unfunny way,"I was actually ordering something for my niece and thought this would be fun to tuck in with her gift - as it popped up while shopping for warm pajama pants for her.I did not see the reviews or I would NEVER have ordered this awful book. Amazon needs to change how they drop those links in from other products.The book has unfunny short statements and the illustrations are just stupid and gross. Reminded me of South Park, which I don't care for, but this was even less amusing than that."
1,Is this really a book?,"I have never seen anything more stupid, dumb, idiotic and moron. Looks like the author has serious psychological problems. It is not poetry, it is a bunch of incoherent words."
3,For the lighthearted,"This book is not meant to be taken seriously. It is a funny, silly, great-gift-to-get-your-girlfriend item or a conversation art piece on your coffee table or around your house. If you don't look at it as a political, socio-economical, psychological view you can actually enjoy it."
1,This was hilarious!,I first heard about this boys are stupid throw rocks at them from a girl who had a crush on me. She kept hitting on me even though I never showed any interest in her and I didn't understand why she was so obsessed with me since I didn't do anything to lead her on. She was getting pretty annoying to say the least. Then I found this book in her room and it all started making sense to me. The book was hilarious! Just thinking about all of the losers who are into this stuff makes me glad i'm no longer around her. There are plenty of good women out there. I don't need one that will throw rocks at me simply because I don't want to be her boyfriend.
5,"Friend read to me, HAD to get for myself",This is the perfect book for a girl who has recently had a break up. It makes you laugh and helps put somethings into perspective. He really did a good job with the art as well. Loved it!
5,Haven't stopped laughing yet!,"I was familiar with Todd Goldman's ""Boys are Stupid"" stuff through the t-shirt line, but this little book goes way beyond. It is so hysterical! I've got it on my coffee table in my office, and everybody who comes in is drawn in by the title, won't stop laughing and just can't put it down!"
1,What a horrible product!,"This book is a typical example of the bias against boys. Our leaders of tomorrow are the boys of today. Those in academia or elsewhere have no right to exalt girls at boys' expense. In classes across the world, girls are being taught how grand and viruous they are, but the boys are shamed into seeing themselves as the sole responsibility for everything bad in the world, and are forced to apolgize for their very existence. We should be encouraging our boys and lifting them up to their future manhood, not rubbishing them with such terrible books as this one. The author has insulted and degraded half of the human race for a buck. Congratulations on your bias-profit. May this piece of trash be used only for fire tinder from here on."
1,"A dangerous, new low...","If something of similar ilk were written about women or blacks (I am both) there would be a major explosion. No wait, I take that back because it would not have even been published.Also, if you think about it, this ""humorous"" book takes a swipe at parenting. Who has boys so Neandertal, ill-mannered and ill-bred? Not me. My teenage son is highly intelligent, mature, well-groomed and has been brought up to be a gentleman, kind to women as I am to him.This author implies that all boys grow up (or rather never really grow up) in an Animal House setting, without parenting.I find no humor in this book. It's just not funny. If anything, it's an appalling, insulting attempt at humor.And an invitation -- even jokingly -- to throw rocks at someone who, according to this book, is mentally challenged? Now that's stupid.Amazon... shame on you."
1,"Publisher should allow ""Throw Rocks at Girls in Iraq"" to be published.","Unbelievable, that this book was allowed to be published. In this P.C. centric society where gosh forbid we say anything negative about women or any racial group, there is a movement of bashing boys, and that's OK.So, are we trying to put boys in their place now ... really knock 'em down while they're young, so they won't cause any trouble when older?How about in our relentless effort to be politically correct, we not treat every race and gender with respect?I'm offended that this book is even visible."
1,Don't support this art thief,Steals artwork from other artists and passes it off as his own. Check out the wikipdedia article for many examples.
1,how mean,"I thought this was going to be a cute and funny book to give my teen daughter, but I'm so disappointed. It's mean and hurtful and inappropriate because I can't let the younger kids see it. It's definitely overpriced for what I got. I don't even want this in my home."
1,Should be banned from poisoning our society,"Imagine a book titled ""Girls are stupid, throw rocks at them and kick them in the genitalia.""Imagine a book titled ""Gays are stupid, throw rocks at them and kick them in the genitalia.""Imagine a book titled ""Blacks are stupid, throw rocks at them and kick them in the genitalia.""I'm a female myself and I find this book offensive. It teaches its readers that ""it's okay to hate"", that ""it's okay to be violent to others"", that ""it's okay to call people stupid"". And some people actually find it funny. No wonder our world is in such a loving, peaceful, beautiful state today."
2,Infinity vs. indefinity,"Apparently Mr Eli Maor somehow missed the 20th century French educated mathematician and metaphysician René Guénon's book, translated from the French original,The Metaphysical Principles of the Infinitesimal Calculus (Guenon, Rene. Works.)in which this author succinctly clarifies some basic questions of mathematical vocabulary, thus resolving apparent theoretical difficulties of calculus.One of Guénon's central themes is the difference between (mathematical) indefinity, often inappropriately referred to as ""infinity"" by e.g. Mr Maor, and absolute or metaphysical infinity, a quite different notion.May this reviewer cordially suggest that Mr Eli Maor study Guénon's book and revise the next edition of his own?Incidentally, the set of ""irrational"" numbers and similar notions are an indefinity."
3,Catching the kids up...,"With the Teen Wolf that is on MTV becoming part of my daughters viewing list, I thought I'd introduce her to the original...This one is not great, but she was happy she watched it...First one is better..."
3,Programing heart,3 1/2A startlingly diverse production adeptness ensures this release has not aged nearly as fast as similarly dated electronic material.
4,Mellow background music,Its great stuff for relaxing to. I sometimes feel like this means that I don't appreciate it enough but I can listen to the cd twice around before I have to go change it for another.
2,Dull and repetitive,"There is just not much creativity to this music. Repetitive drum machine beats mixed with repetitive smooth jazz samples does not make for great ""chill"" music, but simply music which is dull and uninspired. Chill music can still have energy and variety. Actually, it simply MUST. I think there is some really good trip-hop and downtempo music out there, for example: Massive Attack - Protection, DJ Shadow, some albums in the Cafe del Mar series, Moby b-sides, LTJ Bukem Logical Progression..."
2,a disappointingly un-original remake,"I have to disagree with brir@erols.com on this one. Having listened to -- and loved -- NOW's previous CD ""Smoker's Delight"", all I can say is they must've been too delighted with the smoke to create a new album this time around. Rather than expanding on the brilliantly mellow direction of the previous release, it seems like the guys in the band were in creative suspended animation for the intervening years: The whole thing is literally variations on the tracks from ""...Delight"" -- and not even interesting variations! At the very least Warp could've promoted this as variations on previous material rather than passing it off as an original release...I guess it sounds really good if you don't know that they're stealing their own work. Buy the 5-star ""Smoker's Delight"" disc instead!"
4,New Nightmares on Wax finds the perfect groove,"Finally, after a four-year wait, the new album from Nightmares on Wax arrives. If you liked 1995's masterpiece ""Smoker's Delight"" then you'll love ""Carboot Soul."" Lots of laid-back trip-hop beats, deep bass lines, and snatches of funk. More of a band feel this time, with live guitar, bass, and vocals. Great mood music for a party or just chilling and losing yourself to! Anyone looking for a funk-hip-hop instrumental mood music to float away to, you're not going to do any better than Nightmares On Wax. Highly, highly recommended!!"
5,chill music at its best,this CD is awsome if you like this type of music. if you like this type of music BUY IT!!!
1,A gross waste of space,"I am a great Star Trek fan; I even love the first ST movie because it didn't try to be a ""typical"" Hollywood movie and maintained the integrity of the ST universe for the most part.However, I would never buy more of these DVDs because most of the DVD is blank! With the amount of data that can be stored on a DVD, they could have easily put 6 or more episodes on each DVD. So why didn't they? So they could charge you more money! Haven't these vermin made enough money off of these 30+ year old TV shows yet??? The LEAST they could do at this point is provide a space-efficient version of these shows, and double the price of each DVD. Or go to the trouble to include interviews, commentary sound tracks, etc, etc. Simply pathetic, typical Hollywood nonsense."
2,"Attention, the British VHS version is far better!!!!","I was really disappointed with the DVD version of the original Star Trek series. It is too simple, the only extra feature on the DVD are those old traillers which we can find in the American VHS version. If you compare it with the British VHS versions you will see what I mean. In these VHS you can find exclusive interviews with the actors and each video comes with a card to collect; the difference on the quality of the image is almost irrelevant and its case is very pretty and with all the videos together the phrase ""We are the first to reach this far"" is formed; on the other hand the DVD case is too simple with a stupid photo of a character and in an ugly orange-colored stile. In my opinion Star Trek deserves more and this is not the definite collection as people are saying, I bought it and I am sorry I did it. I just hope that the The Next Generation DVD version be better and released soon!!!"
2,no box set!!!,"First off I can't believe Paramount will not make box sets of the original series. I take points of this review for that. plus their is no retrospectives, documentaries, audio commentary.I give the remastered sound an A+ and the remastered picture an A+. But as previous customers have said two episodes per disc is not exceptable. They are too expensive. You can get all seven seasons of next generation, for less than buying each of these original series dvd's separetely for only three seasons. Even the sci-fi network was able to get nimoy and shatner to do interviews for their ""Star Trek special Edition"", the first time it was aired remastered and uncut."
3,Remastering under par.,"Comparing this new remastering against the same episode on VHS is a real disappointment. The colors aren't represented correctly (skin tones and shirt colors change from one sceen to the next), all shadows are just solid black, and I find that the edges on everything too sharp! Marks and scratches on the file haven't been digitally cleaned at all! Compare this remastering to the brilliant remastering of Avengers '67, and you'll see what I mean. The new disk menus are grainy at best."
3,Much the same,"Much the same as it ever was. I know that interviews are available because they where made with the actors in the series. The CDs are of course of better quality then before, but I expected more of my CD collection. If you want more than the Video copies were capable of furnishing you'll have to wait. The interviews done by the Science Fiction channel could have been added as a bonus to this collection. If it sells I hope it's because someone adds the interviews."
3,Enjoyable early episdoes.,"There are two things to recommend about this collection -- Gary Lockwood's chilling performance in 'Where No Man..', and Deforest Kelly's easy-going voice of reason in 'Corbomite'. These are early episodes, so you'll see a lot of beige uniforms and Nimoy shouting his lines -- 'Where No Man' (a pilot for the series) is the slightly better of the two here. (Unfortunately, I agree that the packaging and overall direction of Star Trek on DVD is a bit ludicrous. There is enough room to fit twice as many episodes on a disc, yet this entire series will span 40 DVDs! And the lack of bonus material -- especially the SciFi interviews -- will bug completists)."
5,original is best,"I have aleways loved both of these episodes. Gary Lockwood becomes so powerfull in his esp abilities he dares think of himself as a GOD. Of course Kirk has to take him out but its his best friend. Good writing. The other episode shows kirks wits as he ""bluffs"" an alien into thinking the Enterprize is far more powerfull than it is. By the way, only two episodes per disc is a shame why cant Paramount afford 6 shows a disc the dirty sons of..."
3,Stop screwing around! Release the box set already!,I've already got the other sets. What's the holdup?
1,Only two per disc?,"OK, I was waiting for this series since a long time, but why do they put only two episodes per DVD? Do I have to rent a three bedrooms to store them? Ridiculous. I'm tired of all this Hollywood companies who have no respect for movies and just want to make more and more money. From now on I will just rent movies, cheaper and less disappointing."
1,"Dear Paramount Marketing,","Recently having purchased a DVD player, I was excited to see the old series of Star Trek episodes on DVD. Then I noticed you only put two episodes on one disc! Hmm. I am really disappointed in you Paramount. Why did you do it this way? Is it to make more money? This sure doesn't point to much else. You could have put 6 episodes on a disc and I would have been willing to pay more. So much for efficiency in Technology. Star Trek is a part of me--I grew up on it and would have loved to get the whole collection. But now I will pick only my very favorites and go see the rest in syndication. Please go back to your spreadsheets and rethink this one. -A Fan"
1,"1 STAR FOR PARAMOUNT, 5 FOR THE SERIES!!","Ok my quick gripe here, 18.00 a vol., only two episodes a vol.NO WAY!! I just paid almost 700.00 for the entire seven seasons of TNG, Paramounts money grubbing little fists will have to do better on TOS if they want any more of my cash.Put 3 box set's out there, 1 per season. At about the same price (or maybe less because we know you wont put jack worth of extras in it) as TNG's. Stop trying to rip-off your largest fan base Paramount!!!"
3,I didn't really like it,"Well, I usually like the Nancy Drew files books, but this one just couldn't keep my attention. It was really boring and there wasn't much going on. That doesn't mean that all of the other Nancy Drew Files books are bad, though. I recommend the following Nancy Drew Files Books: #30 Death By Design, #31 Trouble in Tahiti, #24 Till Death Do Us Part, #34 Vanishing Act, #13 Wings of Fear, #6 White Water Terror, #15 Trial By Fire, and #33 Danger in Disguise. THEY ARE THE BEST BOOKS EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!! You have to buy them!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"The Nancy Drew Files, Case #7, Deadly Doubles By, Carolyn Ke","Nancy plays a new kind of sport and murder is the name of the game.Nancy and her friends George and Bess fly down to Washington, D.C, to watch some of the world's best tennsis players shoot for a championship. But the action is hotter off the court when Nancy gets tangled in a bizarre case of mistaken identity.Nancy bears a striking resemblance to Teresa Montenegro, the rising young star from San Carlos. Then Teresa's boyfriend is kidnapped, and Teresa may be next! In a last, desperate move to outwit the hired guns, Nancy and Teresa trade places. Nancy strides onto center court to play a deadly game of doubles-while a ruthless killer stalks her from the stands. I gave this book 2 stars because this book is entertaining, but gets you hopelessly confused without a solid plot."
1,Caveat Emptor: This Album is NOT as Advertised,"Please beware: although the Amazon site lists 20 songs on this album, in fact it only contains songs 13-20. I discovered this when I received the album and opened it. I immediately noticed the disk itself said Vol. II. So I started looking for Vol. I, which was nowhere to be found. Finally, I discovered some tiny, tiny print on the back on the album that said something to the effect that, due to ""time limitations"" only Vol. II could be included on this CD. Wow! I am sure Amazon did not intentionally mislead its customers, but you will be sorely disappointed if you are expecting to receive an album with 20 songs on it. If this had been Vol. I, I would have kept it; but the songs I really wanted were the first 12, so I returned it."
3,Ok -- but not her best work,"I must concur that the Social Songs are quite wonderful -- and yes, the rest sounds country western -- but Joanne Shenandoah's voice is so powerful that they are still worth listening to. Not the best album to get the full strength and energy that Joanne Shenandoah can produce -- but her voice is so forceful and full that even the English worded County Western sounding songs only prove her greatness. This, I believe, is her first album and was originally self-produced. She has grown a great deal since this was first recorded. The Social Songs alone -- as short as they are -- are almost worth purchasing the CD for. So it gets a 3 and not a 5."
4,Joanne Shenandoah: A Different Perspective,"This CD afforded me the opportunity to experience the musical talents of Joanne Shenandoah in English. It was a wonderful treat for me and further increased my appreciation for her beautiful voice. The selections have a Country & Western flavor, with light accompanyment that allows her voice to remain the focal point. I was especially touched by 35 More Miles and They Didn't Listen. However, my favorite selection is Someone Who, which captured me the first time around and continues to do so. Repeated listening does not diminish my attraction to these selections."
3,"I love Joanne, but...","I love the work Joanne does to preserve and popularize traditional Iroquoise music. My favorite in this album is the first cut, Iroquois Social Songs. To me, this is some of Joanne's best work. I would have bought this album if it had more songs like that on it, but the rest of them all sound like Country Western songs to me, so I didn't buy it."
2,It was country music,I love her Oneida songs but not a fan of country music. I play her native music non-stop and would highly recommend her CDs.
4,Great piece of journalistic work,"This book is the essential companion to The Armies Of The Night--it tells about the conventions of 1968 in Miami & Chicago, & how the latter turned into a riot. Unlike Armies Of The Night, however, the writing isn't peaking, & Mailer isn't on the front. Instead, he's being a journalist (& a good one at that!)For anybody interested in this side of American history, this book is a must. The part on Nixon being elected in Miami is the weakest part--read it quickly. The real beef lies in the second part on the Democrat convention in Chicago. You'll get shocks, laughs, everything you've come to expect from Norman Mailer."
2,Good For Historians Of The Period,"This book is a true curio of the times, of interest mostly to historians of the period. Mailer fails to describe the details of what went on at the conventions, although he does give the reader `a feel' for events, and some of the snapshots he provides are good, especially those of the violence and terror of Chicago. In the end, the reader will be disappointed, both because of the failure to completely describe what is happening and because of the writer's verbose style and intrusive narrative devices. The writing style definitely is distracting and confusing, Mailers tendency to use bizarre metaphors and long wordy descriptions provides confusion rather than clarity. Recommended only as a companion piece to books like `The Making Of The President 1968'by White and McGinnnis' `Selling Of The President 1968'."
3,Falls short talking about adopted/rescued dogs,"I hate to be contrary, but this is primarily a book about training your dog, not about re-homing a dog. I give the book 4 stars for training suggestions, but only 2 for talking about specific issues for a rescued/adopted pet.I am disappointed because I'm considering getting a rescued dog and I'd like to know what to expect and how to deal with the specific problems that are unique to second hand dogs.Some things I wanted to know: What are typical health problems that come with a rescued dog? How do I deal with a dog that is fearful/anxious/depressed? How do I correct my dog without triggering a surprise negative response? How do I get my dog to accept affection? How do we make the dog feel comfortable and safe in his new home?This book will certainly come in handy for training, but I need some answers about what it takes to rehome and relove a rescued dog first. I'll need to go elsewhere."
5,this is a great book,"I am buying this book after lending out my original copy to new dog owners so many times that I finally lost it. This is a very clear, concise dog training book. It's one of the best you can get, especially if you don't have the patience to read an entire long book. I love Carol Lea Benjamin's other training books also (How to Survive Your Dog's Adolescence is amazing), but this one is great, too, and a little more of a quick read."
2,Keep looking,"I'm sorry, I was really disappointed with this book, disappointed enough to write my first amazon.com review. The intention is great and as an owner of 3 rescue dogs I support the movement entirely. However, I felt the book was a fast overview of dog ownership, touching on training, care and personal stories, but none of those areas were handled in enough detail. I think this is particularly dangerous with the training section, which seems out-dated and emphasized correcting the dog more so than creating a scenario where the dog will succeed.This is a great topic and an easy read, but I personally wish that the author would have done a detailed compilation of rescue stories."
2,Second Hand Dog - Too Little for Too Much,"I read ""Dogs For Dummies"" and they recommended this book but after reading it I found it to be lacking in much useful information. It's very short and full of pretty nuch useless graphics. If you are a total beginner and want a quick & simple read on getting started with a new dog then go for it otherwise, I'd skip this one."
2,Disappointing,I was dissappointed with the amount of time the speakers spent trying to raise money for the project and the use of the profanity. It detracted from the content.
3,not all that great,"Bought these for my son to take on a field trip, pictures came back and we were very disappointed. The flash doesnt really work well and the zoom not so well either. Very grainy pics."
3,"great toy, but...........","i got this as a gift, and when i did i ripped it open and loved it right away. unfortunatly, my little sister got to it, swollowed 12 beadS...... and............HOSPITAL RUN!!!!!!!(NOT A PRETTY SIGHT, BELIVE ME)"
1,Defective Bag,"I purchased this bag for use during the 2010 Baseball season. Within 3 weeks, the seams started showing wear & coming unsewn . I contacted Easton & was told they would replace it since I was one day outside of the Amazon return window. Long story short, I ended up having a ""courtesy refund"" issued by Amazon. Easton & Amazon both had me going in circles from one to the other. Thankfully though, Amazon at least came through & refunded my money on this bag. The hard plastic bottom did great (was our main selling feature), but the material itself was no better than any other bat bag we've purchased. In fact, it lasted less time than any previously purchased brand of bag. Huge disappointment."
5,Great Bag,Great bag everything fits and separate compartments keep it neat. Bottom has great support and overall bag is very durable. My son loves it.
3,Instructions hard to figure out,Instructions are hard to figure out and no matter what I do I can't make it quit switching time when I travel from one state to the other. I tried putting it in the proper mode but it won't stay there.
5,Intrigue At The Highest Levels,"I didn't purchase this book through Amazon or any of it's affiliates. I was but a wee lad when it was given me to read. Don't be misled, I read at a high level in middle school.What I can remember is that this book was banned in the UK. It is speculatory based on fact. Ian Fleming can't touch this stuff. The facts are compelling and you wind up believing that the head of British homeland intelligence was truly up to no good. I have tried to look for it in any format; but, it is really difficult. It is almost as if the conspiracy continues to this day. If anybody has it and has never read it, read it. You will not put the book down until you are finished."
4,A great read!,"A mixture of the hilarious and the poignant, ""It's a Jungle Out There"" is a thoroughly enjoyable read. His insights into a totally different culture and the total lack of consumerism that was a part of the culture they grew up in was refreshing. His observation that he and his siblings hated to leave the jungle to come to ""civilization"" was a good commentary...maybe our ""civilization"" isn't so civil after all.If you've wondered what it would be like to be a Missionary's Kid, this book will give you a good idea. Sit down and enjoy! Let it take you back to being a kid too!"
4,Entertaining look at missionary life in Peru from a boy's viewpoint,Snell does a good job at accurately portraying life as an MK (missionary kid) in the jungles of Peru. He paints a word picture of his adventures and close calls as a boy who loves the jungle life and all it encompasses while his parents work as translators of the Bible for jungle tribes in remote Peru. Heartily recommend it!
5,Excellent series!,This series was first given to us by my mother and we greatly enjoyed reading the stories. Inspiring missionary tales that make us want to go visit missionary friends in that area. Suitable for reading aloud in a car with tired kids while traveling.
3,Better back up the connector colors.,From the pic on here it looks like they will be too short from that rectangle piece to the connectors but thats not the case. Its long enough where they dont get in the way of each other. One thing thats really bad is the color coded bands are peeling off. Not good at all. If they happen to all come off u will basically have to throw this away or do trial n error to figure out whats what.
2,"Consider another book, for goodness sake!","Please consider another book, this book is far too expensive and the information can only be conidered borderline."
1,Had to return,Unfortunately I had to return this product because it has whey in it. I am not sure why a garlic supplement would have whey in it. Since I do not tolerate dairy products I could not use it. Very disappointed.
4,Was it actually that long ago???,"It's hard to imagine that this album was released almost a quarter of a century ago...in 1980. That said, the disc definitely bears the CHIC stamp, with the cuts being written/produced by Niles Rodgers and Bernard Edwards. The songs fit into the format, featuring light lyrics, heavy and moving bass guitar licks, and the trademark Chic strings.Frequent lead Kathy Sledge stands out even when the sisters are singing as a unit. Hers is a voice that is underrated and deserving of greater recognition in the music biz.The best tracks include the title cut, ""I'm a Good Girl,"" ""Reach Your Peak"" (a tad too repetitive but enjoyable), ""and ""Let's Go on Vacation."""
3,Weak Chic,"Good Sister Sledge performaces throughout. However, Nile Rodges and Bernard Edwards came up with some really bad songs here. I'm sorry, their lyrics are really bad. On the positive side, I think they brought out the best in the artists they produced, came up with some wicked grooves, and were awesome musicians. On the negative, Easy Street and Let's Go On Vacation sound like they were written by bored 3rd graders. Kathy sings the hell out of Gotta Love Somebody and You Fooled Around. Reach Your Peak is a clever, definitly singable song. Joni sings lead on this one, I think. Pretty Baby is a great song, sung by the whole group, it has a throbbing bass line throughout. I would really like to hear Kathy on more of these songs. And what would a Sister Sledge LP be without a totally forgetable ballad, here we get How To Love. Thank God, they teamed with Narada Michael Walden on the next album, All American Girls. I'd say THAT is the best SS album, start to finish."
1,Shame on you!!!,"Can't release the final Volume??? What is it with you big companies??? Too lazy to finish what you started but, able to produce garbage in the theatres!!! Fire whoever is in charge and find a real person in charge to do the job right!!!"
4,Hot Music & Hotter Writing,"This book had to be written by someone who must have lived the life of a musician on the road. I was a roadie for five years and I saw some of the same things like they're described in this book. The sex and drugs are rampant. The strange people are always there, crowding around the players, wanting attention, wanting to be a part of the scene. E.Layne Kelly caught that atmosphere. She nailed it. If you're into music, you'll dig this one."
5,Real Rockers,"Rolling Stone magazine has tried to warn us for years that people like this really exist, but maybe I didn't believe them. This book delivers a jolt of reality that is stunning. My friends and I listen to rock music every day and often hear about the outrageous behavior of rockers, but reading about Peter Woody's life is an experience all its own. The plot is like a psychedelic trip filled with self-inflicted pain, but also suffused with glimpses of love and in the end, self-redemption. The rawness of the language backed by the quirky, brash, unapologetic writing style is reflective of the subject matter--power rockers unbalanced on the edge of total craziness. This totally rocks!"
3,Napoli,"I love this pattern and have owned it for about 3 years. Unfortunately, it chips very easily. That is why I bought more plates, to replace all ones I have had to throw away. About a year ago, I bought some commercial grade plates in matching colors to use for everyday use. Now I only use the Napoli when I have company. I gave only three stars because they are not durable, but they are attractive."
2,"Chips terribly, NOT microwave safe",I loved this pattern and bought a 10 place setting set (through a different website). Almost every bowl and several of the plates are chipped at the edges 8 months later. Microwave anything on them and the plate is searing hot. Very disappointed.
3,"more ura, less omote","I know that many dislike this book for its highly stylized content. Some say, ""Lots of fluff not much stuff."" If one was to be utilitarian about it, then this book is really a waste of cash. But then again, it depends upon what you are expecting. It certainly is not a text on stick or pole fighting for a novice. I guess in some ways it may not even be a text on stick fighting! The applications and photos require insight into the inner meaning of things, with little being obvious. I must say that had I not seen Hatsumi actually move, and also practiced martial arts for some time, I would have been clueless. This book for me was less instructional than it was in giving a certain feeling. Again, another one of Hatsumi's teaching methods that can be confusing. He certainly is not teaching to the lower levels. If you are looking for a Hatsumi book that is more user-friendly, check out his classic ""Stick Fighting"" coauthored with Quasten.Enjoy!"
3,Very basic accurate watch,"This watch tells time. That is it. It syncs itself from an atomic clock timeserver, so it keeps very accurate time.There are other watches that do more with the same time sync capability. You may want to look at one of those first.The watch has no back lighting. The band is not the greatest either.Timex and Casio both make radio controlled watches. Investigate those first.It is not a bad watch, but it is not outstanding either."
3,Watch clouds up when my arm sweats,"When it is warm weather& my arm sweats, my watch steams up with moisture & I cannotread the time."
5,best book ever,"my father used to read this book to me when i was little, now i own it for my son, it is imaginative, fun, and absolutely a must for any child's collection!!! love this book!"

2,Could Be Worse,"If I had realized this was published by the creationist Discovery Institute, I would have saved my money. Not as bad as I feared when I noticed that. Most of the arguments and claims on both sides are repetitive. Except for a few mistakes, Kurzweil's arguments much better than the ""Critics"" arguments. The most glaring mistake, pointed out by Searle, was his mistating/misunderstanding of the Church-Turing Thesis; it took me two minutes with my encyclopedia of mathematics to check out, but Kurzweil just repeated his mistaken claim in his rebuttal. Most of Searle's argument was pretty silly, so maybe Kurzweil never considered part of it might be right.If you have read Age of Spiritual Machines, this is a waste of time.If you haven't read it, it is a better source than this book. The better arguments of the critics were mostly already covered in that book. Kurzweil's initial statement in chapter 1 of this book is a much condensed version of Age of Spiritual Machines."
1,Where is the weak AI?,"Forget ""Strong AI."" Show us something more than Kismet, the bushy eyebrowed, ping-pong-ball-appointed mechanical frowning/smiling machine. (Weren't Imagineers doing this stuff at Disney World in the mid 70s?) Show us something more than object oriented programming, expert systems (recipe books), or fuzzy logic (a $10 phrase for abstracting grey data).Consciousness is more than a bunch of microscopic open and closed circuits. It's nothing more than wishful thinking to insist that any progress at all has been made in this area since people first leaned back in their chairs and stared at the ceiling in the late 1950s."
4,Good discussion of both sides,"After reading Kurzweil's books ""The Age of Spiritual Machines"" and part of ""The Singularity is Near"" I wanted to hear some critics about his theories, beacuse one side of the discussion often blurs your view of the overall issue. This book provides a good discussion of both sides about Strong AI. I still agree with Kurzweil's view, but I really liked reading how others think about it. Read this book if you've read some of Kurzweil's work before and like to hear another perspective. The book can also be used as an introduction to the field, because the first chapter is a summery of Kurzweil's theories, which he describes at full length in his books. The only downside to this book is the repetitive character of the arguments that sometimes get tiring to read."
3,Good but often repetitive,"In this book, the pessimists bring to light some huge mountains that will have to be crossed before AI ever becomes a reality. The same ideas are repeated over and over and over again. A lack of having a steady stream of new information soon becomes tedious to get through. Nevertheless, new information does keep pouring in, albeit at a slow place, and makes reading the entire book worthwhile for any AI enthusiast."
3,I like it better than White Buffalo,"My first Robert Tree Cody album was a collaboration with Hovia Edwards, ""Reflections"", that was great so I decided to get ""White Buffalo"" based on that and the favorable reviews here at Amazon. White Buffalo had too much synthesizer stuff in it for my tastes, ""Grandfather "" is almost entirely cedar flute with just a little drum work(on #11)6 out of 11 selections have some chanting or singing accompanying the music, it didn't sound like words but vocalizations to me on most of them. #8 Lakota Lullaby did seem worded and #11 Stomp Dance had even more of a word rather than chant sound. I like an authentic sounding American Indian music album but this one is at a low end for me, Hovia Edwards is better, more life to her music maybe."
2,Super Clips are not Super,I bought these clips because they were recommended for the Conair Jumbo curlers that I already own. They will not hold the curlers in place. Tried turning both ways with no success.
1,bad purchase,my daughter thought she just had to have these clips. She was so disappointed when she got them and tried to use them. They did not do what they are suppose to do. had a lot of difficulty and trouble.Here they sit in the bathroom closet in the box. Wish I would've returned them. DO not buy these.
3,THEY CHANGED THE MUSIC!!,"Great looking DVD's but They changed the music!!The opening credits theme is NOT the first season version music but the version used on the second pilot ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"". They added Shatner's narration but the music is not the original version that was used during the first season. Each season they re-recorded the theme for that year. They are all different in the musical arrangements and instrumentals.This is NOT the firat season version! I know it is a small point but I think it is really sh#@y that they would take the time to redo the music. It must be money related."
5,2 great Kirk episodes,"Mudd's Women...Kirk beams up Harry Mudd & 3 ultra-sexy women who no man can seem to resist. But are they really that beautiful? Watch & find out.The Enemy Within...Kirk is duplicated in a transporter accident. See Shatner portray Kirk's ""evil side"" with absolute brilliance."
1,No good at all,I was so disappointed at the first time I used this machine. Rices got stuck inside and it needed a lot of power to take them out of it. The rices that came out was formed like cube and too small to put any sashimi on top.The other problem is cleaning. I can not figure out how to clean rices sticked inside it after uses and did not even bother cleaning it because I do not think I would be using it again.
5,This is one of the Best albums to be made...EVER!!!,I'm not gonna lie and say every track is bangin' but I will say 85% of the album is bangin...and that the songs that are good are really good. Can't wait for the next one. If you don't have this one you're sleepin.
4,Cheers 2 Playa,"This is a very good and extremely underrated cd! Still, they should've put on ""Your Dress"" from the Dr. Dolittle Soundtrack instead of the ""I Gotta Know"" closer w/ Foxy Brown.... Then this beautiful CD would've definately been a five star effort. Peace out to Playa and Timbo! Cu around soon!"
4,Playing catch up,"I always loved this song,Cheers To You.But never purchased it.I heard it on the radio and I knew I had to have it this time! At the price I was going to pay for the single,I decided to purchase the entire Lp.It was a good choice."
4,Playa Play On!,"I have to say that Playa is not a joke! Static (RIP), Smoke, & Black bring raw passion to the music game with this album everything from the lyrical content to the production and vocal arrangements make this CD a nice ride. It's ashame they only released one CD. If you want more of Playa check out Smoke & Black's solo efforts. Because whether together or apart these three guys have a talent that REAL music lovers cant deny.Top cuts: All the way, I-65, Everybody wana luv, PUSH, Together, & Top of the World"
4,Pretty Good,"This was a pretty good album. Playa can definitely sing. Other than Static, I don't know what happened to the other two. True music fans should enjoy this even if you don't know who Playa is. Granted they are not that famous but if you hang around the Timbaland/Missy/Aaliyah and Magoo crowd you have no trouble recognizing the name first off. Get this album! I don't think they made a second. If they did it must not have gotten promotion because I never heard of it. Another underrated group. By the way, kudos to Static for writing all the good songs on Aaliyah's last album."
2,Not worth buying,I thought maybe since Timbaland and Missy had something to do with this album it might be good. WRONG! I can't even hit shuffle on my CD player. This CD is the worse...
1,Over-priced and absurd.,"After rolling dozens of rolls using a traditional mat, I bought this item due to its claim to help with inside out rolls. It turns out that the help it provides is the advice that you buy a teflon mat. I did...and I returned this overblown piece of junk. Unfortunately, I then got hit with Amazon.com's restocking fee. A very unsatisfactory experience all around."
2,"sushi@home press , just another fab to be cool","I've been eating and making sushi for almost 4 yrs. and I really enjoy it. This was before eat sushi to be cool fab. ha ha! Anyways, the sushi@home maki roller is no better than the matt. The sushi@home maki roller cost any where from $49.99 up to $90 but it should cost no more than $30. Since the sushi fab, you can't hardly find them at stores but give it a year or 2 and most people will be getting rid them."
1,Disney Fairies Tinker Bell and Friends,"The charms are very cute, but smell like skunk. I have washed them, aired them out, and soaked them. The odor will not come out. So if you want very cute charms, and can get passed the smell, order these.....if you have a good nose, stay clear."
2,Competent But Generic,"In today's saturated Power Metal scene, it can be a challenge to wade through the mass of bands out there to find anything truly worthwhile. So where does Highland Glory rank? Well, for me, they don't quite make the cut. This album features very competent, Euro-style power metal similar to bands like Elegy, Insania, and Balance of Power, The problems I have with this album are 1) the singer's voice doesn't quite work for me, being too limited in range and slightly irritating; 2) the songs lack any real punch or conviction- there's no HEAVY in their Metal; 3) As a long-time power metal fan (going on 20 years), there's just nothing new or innovative to hear here. I don't mind a generic band if they can at least play it w/ conviction, but that's not the case herein, and so Highland Glory becomes just another face in the crowded power metal scene. They'll need to punch it up alot if they want to run with the elite bands like Blind Guardian, Dragonforce & Kamelot"
3,Pretty Good overall,"I bought this for my father who lives on the Outer Banks. It has been up and running trouble free for nearly 2 years. I set it up for him and thought that part was fairly simple. You will need a level and a compass and knowledge of the degree of declination between true and magnetic north for your region. The only problems we have had is, blackbirds like to think the rain gauge is their personal potty. We fixed this by putting a flimsy wire over the bucket.The up side: a fairly accurate reliable weather station at a low price.The down side: if you want to know how fast that last gust of wind was, this unit won't do it. It takes readings periodically so you only get a reading every so many minutes. If you want real time readings you can't go wireless without dropping some serious money.All things being equal he likes it, I like it, and it has survived 2 years of salt air environment and 2 hurricanes so, it aint too shabby."
1,Batteries not replaceable,I have a WS 2010 weather station that the coin batteries in the instruments have died after three years service. The same thing was reported by Gary Woltkamp. When purchising a weather station you want to make sure the batteries are a replaceable item.
2,Think Twice Before You Order,"I ordered this unit 2 years ago. Now the wind speed unit no longer works because the battery is bad. Called the service unit at La Crosse about getting a new battery, they said to order a new wind speed indicator at $100, as no replacement battery was available. If you have a bad battery in your 2 year old Lexus would you junk it and get a new car! Of course not, you would replace the bad battery and drive it for another 10 years. Order from La Crosse only if you expect the unit to last 2 years and no help from their service dept. Typical of items made in China, no service aviable, if it goes bad buy a new one and help the Chinese economy and to hell with the U.S.A. and their people."
4,For me...the right book at the right time!,"A book about leaving the city, leaving your business behind and moving to Georgia. I wonder why it was that I became so enamored of this book and it's author. Becuase, I'm about to do the same thing. This is the kind of book that I could probably read again and again. It suanders. It meanders. It is relaxed. It's scope is wide, it's execution is simple and effortless. I found myself yearning to be the author's guest at her little cabin by the pond. I wanted to pet her dogs, drink a beer with her neighbors. I wanted to walk in her woods. Fantastic job at gentle memoir."
1,Anti-Nature Book,"This book was unfortunately listed under Nature Literature. If your idea of nature is letting your dogs go wild in the forest to kill every animal they can find; if your idea of nature is taking your gun and killing every animal that you can find, then this is the book for you. If you believe in living in nature with respect for and knowledge of all the living things, then this book will make you sick. I live in a forest and if anyone let their dogs out like she does to harass and kill the native animals, they would be arrested."
4,Bravo!,"Not for everyone, but those that understand will want to say to Ms. Blackmarr, ""Thank you and good job."""

4,"A Good CD, But NOT Luther Johnson!","This retrospective CD offers some insight to the development of a guitarist who has become very popular on the festival circuit and elsewhere over the past few years. I enjoyed the CD tremendously, but it is NOT Luther ""Guitar Junior"" Johnson. This CD is by Lonnie Brooks, at one time called himself Guitar Junior, but changed when he relocated to Chicago and found out about Luther ""Guitar Junior"" Johnson. Read through the extensive liner notes to find out the story about one Lee Baker, who called himself Guitar Junior in Louisiana, but changed his name to Lonnie Brooks shortly after his arrival in Chicago.Lonnie Brooks fans will enjoy this CD, Luther Johnson fans will be disappointed if they expect to hear the venerable Mr. Johnson."
3,Hercule Poirot performs a miracle . . .,"and solves this crime in the last few pages of the book, with little to go on and less proof than usual that what he says is right. Agatha doesn't let us see the wheels working in this book, as she usually does, which is disappointing. The solution suddenly came about in a big rush after many chapters spent dithering around with a story. Granted, it's an interesting story -- but in the end, I was left wanting more."
3,Average,"I'm partial to the Miss Marple mysteries, however, I wanted to try the Hercule Poirot character. This story was somewhat interesting and the end was somewhat of a surprise, but mostly this book is strictly average."
5,Great Mystery,"I have to say that this book was far better then Mystery of the Blue Train. It had more twists and turns then a roller coaster. The trouble was I couldn't distinguish between the real clues and all the red herrings. All the characters looked so suspicious, and everyone seemed to have a motive. At one point I thought that everyone in the house was involved in the murder of Marlene and disappearance of Hattie, even the butler (lol). Alec & Peggy Legge was who my mind settled on close to the end. All the clues left by them, the bracelet, the mysterious rendezvous, the boy in the turtle shirt; they were just red herrings produced to stump the reader. I felt that the bracelet was a big clue, I just didn't know where it went, and boy was I wrong. Never in a million years would I have believed who it turned out to be. This was a great book!"
4,Great to listen to,"If you are a fan of Agatha Christie, this is a great story. I really like that it is performed by different characters and voices. I was a little disappointed that it is abridged and not the whole book, but only because I didn't want it to end."
2,The worst one from Christie's I've read.,"This is easily the worst mystery I've read from Dame Agatha. It's drab in comparison to her other works, and the big set-up ends in a big let-down. It's simply forgettable and pedestrian.If you skip it, you won't miss anything.Suggestions: The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Death On the Nile, Murder On the Orient Express, Peril At End House, and the non-Poirot one, And Then There Were None."
5,A playful and well-done mystery,"I found this to be an enjoyable and playful mystery. Agatha introduces an old woman who is a mystery novelist, who is somewhat like herself. Face-to-face with Poirot, they get enmeshed in a sinister plot. The story was well-done and Agatha's writing style is immaculate. There is as much literature in here as there is mystery. A good development of characters, a study of the society around, and a description of the setting that makes me feel I live there. As for who did it? I remained perplexed until the very last chapter."
2,"Nice idea, but...","I've bought this product at Marshall's for $30.00 (!!!!). The idea is nice: it uses GPS system to record distance, pace, altitude and calories burned. The instruction states it may take up to 90 seconds to get GPS signal outdoors; while it worked nicely around my rural Pennsylvania house, it flatly refused to register anything for about 3-5 minutes in Brooklyn, NY. Unfortunately it doesn't allow you to do automatic 1-mile split time. It is difficult to put on the arm. The real problem is: after I changed the battery it stopped working properly and I can no longer use it! I guess I got $30.00 worth of use, but paying over $100... I don't think so! I was also not able to register the product for warranty over the internet, because it asks for Registration Number that doesn't exist; to register it by mail you have to send a card to United Kingdom!"
5,A truly wonderful book,"Another great job, Georgia Bockoven! I tried hard to take more than a day to read this book--it was so good I didn't want it to end. The emotions rang true, the characters were complete, and the story was so real that these people might've lived next door to me. Real people--that's what made this book a winner to me."
4,Simple but Brilliant,"This is a solo album in the truest sense of the word. Robyn plays all the instruments on this one, which is either an acoustic guitar or a piano . The songs sound very complete despite the simple if not basic arrangements. Several songs on this disc stand out, ""Raining twilight coast"", ""Queen Elvis"",and ""Glass Hotel"". The greatest work here may be ""Agony of Pleasure"" (This was Beverly's favorite) . Really there are no bad cuts , although if you are not familiar with Robyn's other works you may be better served getting your hands on ""Globe of frogs"" or ""Queen Elvis"". Overall a real treat , if you like his other work you will dig this as well."
5,Makes me do things,"Somehow, the accoustic side of Robyn always inspires me to do chores. Not just simple chores, mind you, but BIG household chores. And not my house, but a friend's house. As a matter of fact, the first time I listened to this album, I was at the home of my future wife, sanding down the walls to be painted. The music inspired a sort of zen-like motivation to do things in a slightly different way. It sealed my fate, as I ended up marrying the girl. It'll seal yours as well."
4,Great Songs from a great Singer Song writer,"Just re listened to this album, and I still love most of the songs on it.The sound is bare acoustic and piano and voice and it suits Robyn's talents well. I saw him play this album live at Einstein's in Jax Beach, FL when it came out in 1990, and he was amazing. There are stand out moments on every song, with my favorites being, Satelite, Cynthia Mask, Beutiful Girl, Lincus House. Very Syd Barrett."
4,another strangely wonderful Hitchcock,"Hitchcock's working solo on EYE, and that usually means the songs will be a bit more sedate in sound, if not lyrically. To try to understand just where Hitchcock is going with his songs is almost an irrational act; the songs are cleverly frustrating, but at least EYE has an intimate feeling, which allows you to enter Hitchcock's world. The idea of choices makes its appearance; starting with Chamberlain's choice to appease Hitler on ""Cynthia Mask,"" whether or not you have ""the nerve to be Queen Elvis."" There are relatively straightforward relationship songs, like ""Executioner,"" with its sense of foreboding, ""Transparent Lover,"" looking at the ephemeral nature of love, and the sheer joy of ""Beautiful Girl."" Sometimes there are just some slightly skewed glimpses of daily life (""Flesh Cartoons,"" ""Clean Steve"") Mix in a couple of pretty instrumentals and you have another strangely wonderful Robyn Hitchcock recording."
3,"Good, But Expected More","I purchased this DVD, because I am a special education teacher. I enjoyed the stories of the five students and I think it was a bit of an eye opener for me to intervene some more with a few of mine. Wtih names like Mel Levine and Rick Lavoie I expected to hear about more strategies and ways to intervene.If you have children with special needs or are a member of the general public interested in this area, this is a great documentary. If you are already in the special education field, don't expect more than stories. I wish there was more ways to intervene with these students with special needs. Overall, it was a good DVD, but not what I expected and did not give any knowledge beyond what I already knew.I would suggest going to the PBS website, they have some great simulations of what it is like to be a student with special needs."
4,Mostly Great Songs But Some Nonsense In The Background,"Every song, except the title track, is good on this album. There are some misc. sounds used on it that simply hurt my ears. The songs the have the industrial or rap sounds don't over do it. Yet, when they are heard, they are very annoying. The Ballads on this Album are better than the ones from Nine Lives, though much less commercial. A lot of the songs remind me of ""Big Ten Inch Record"" because they are really tounge in cheek. One thing I can say about this album is, It's hands down the best record of 2001 thus far."
2,Just say No,"This is where a lot of Aerosmith fans had to draw the line. Did these guys have toys in the attic or what? I'll give them credit for a couple of good tunes on here but they sure don't rock like they used to. I think Joe Perry must have been in the bathroom when they recorded this. If you want to understand why this cd frustrates me so just go back and listen to ""Rocks""."
3,Please NO more Ballads,"Aerosmith have done the ballad style to the limit and all of them, since their hit Angel (Permanent Vacation), sound just the same. This is what makes this record a little boring. I do not blame, after all this formula has made the band very successful since their come back but they could try and givus a break!.The best way to listen to this CD is to program your CD player to skip the ballads. By doing this you discover the hard rocking Aerosmith that is still alive and delivering true rock and roll."
2,What the (...),"Aerosmith were my favorite band for many years, and I was excited when I heard the new album, Just Push Play, was coming out. I love all of the albums, from all of the periods, but when I put this on, my heart sank. Where has the fire gone? Nine Lives was uneven, but at least half of the tracks were superb. This album, however, is unfortunate. The band needs to spend more time playing together, as well as having some more input on songwriting from the other band members. Remember songs like 'Sweet Emotion'? Yeah, Tom Hamilton came up with that. How about 'Voo Doo Medicine Man'? Brad Whitford all the way. Hey, Steven and Joe: leave those new guys at home and look at the resources you have right in front of you."
1,not their best,"aerosmith, in the past has some of the best hard rock and roll hits of all time. This album was mostly pop music exept for about two songs. This album, in my opinion was to make money like every other pop band. Aerosmith has to get to the drawing boards and get back to songs like ""toys in the attic"" and ""draw the line."""
1,TIME TO RETIRE....,"this is REALLY the album that turns me off from AEROSMITH!!!! as many said, their 70[s stuff is AMAZING, and i like PERMANENT VACATION, PUMP, GET A GRIP and NINE LIVES.....than comes the sappy horrible ballad from the armageddon movie, and i think AEROSMITH TOTALLY SELL THEIR SOUND!!!!! and WHERE IS JOE PERRY? Where[s the rock guitars? JUST PUSH PLAY is a collection of the most POP, sappy and boring songs AEROSMITH EVER RECORDED!!!! REALLY SAD, guys!!! You once were one of the BEST ROCK bands of the world......."
2,"Aerosmith misses the mark on ""just push play""","I think that aerosmith has made their worst record in years.I can't believe that steven actually raps on this record and the songs don't have that gritty rock n roll feel.There are some rockers on this cd but they don't have that raw sound to them.I am really let down by this aerosmith release.This album contains a lot more commercial fluff than ""nine lives"" did.While there may be a few good songs,the cd as a whole is relatively weak."
4,aerosmith still has it!,"it freakin' rocks! i love that it was recorded in a different fashion than the other albums (they took a chance with all the new digital hardware). hey, if aerosmith can record on digital equiptment, i don't wanna hear any ... from all the analog junkies! this album sounds great, and rocks out! peace."
2,Can you say MAINSTREAM?,"No I dont hate this band and yes I love their classic ones but what the hell is this? How can the real fans give it a 3,4,5 stars review? Just listen to it and tell me it doesn't sound exactly the same like everything (which now is considered ""Rock n Roll"") that's being played on Mtv, or worst listen to their old stuff and compare it to this one IF it can be compared and tell me these guys haven't sold themselves completley out. Don't agree with me? Listen to Boys Of Summer from their latest greatest hits for cryin out loud!I feel sorry for their hardcore fans or for the people that bought this album before even listening atleast the samples that you can find at the music stores. I lost respect for this band but I still love their oldies. Oh well, I guess nothing can last forever."
1,"They sold their souls for rock and roll, except this one doesn't really rock","In the April 30th 2009 issue of Rolling Stone, Joe Perry discusses the new Aerosmith album planned for 2010. He wants it to sound more likeHonkin' on Boboand less like ""Just Push Play.""Quoting Joe: ""That one brought us back down to earth after putting out records like ""Just Push Play."" I listen to that record, and I'm not sure that it's my band.""You're not alone, Joe. And Joe's words tell you pretty much anything you need to know about this album. If Aerosmith could step into a time machine and go back to the time immediately preceding their recording of this turkey and cancel the sessions, they'd be a better band and the world of music would be better for it.Good luck with the new album, Joe. At least you can see where you jumped the shark."
1,Just don't push play NO MORE!!!!!!!!!,"Just Push play is the sad final of one of the decadent bands of the american commercial circuit. Sounds terrorific!!!!.You know...Aerosmith is the bad copy of the Stones, but the Stones plays Rock n Roll!!!... If you want to hear rock, waste your money in a Rock band...Stones, Stooges, ....In Just Push Play, Aerosmith now experimented adult oriented music like REO o Chicago, and sounds really bad!!!!. Hey men: leave the make up and Just don't push play NO MORE!!!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!"
2,Two good songs,"Alright, this was hopefully Aerosmiths last pop albumfor awhile... The problem is that Jaded and the titletrack are the only songs worthwhile. After that thealbum becomes a total waste of time. These kind ofrecord come out after you get so money hungry thatyou will throw out anything that will please themajority without thinking of those that helped youbecome famous in the first place.If you want to here Aerosmith listen to Aerosmith/Rocks/Toys in the Attic/P.Vacation/Pump/Honkin onBobo. The rest of the albums are below average teeniepoper stuff."
2,Very Different,"There is not one song on this album that starts off with a straight ahead rock and roll beat. Every song has that techno/industrial rubbish beginning (excluding the power ballads). Not one song grabs you like ""9 Lives,"" or ""Monkey On My Back,"" or ""Fever,"" etc. Why try and be so fancy? Why try to be so unlike their other albums. Why pull a U2?"
2,It's All About Two Songs For Me...,"It's just what I said in my title and the songs are Jaded and Don't Want To Miss A Thing. Just download these songs. Other people might like the rest of these songs because we can't all like the same thing, but I definitely love these two songs only."
3,more poppy but with some good songs.,"the top ten hit single 'jaded' is a great song and so are a few others here but overall this is more poppy then I would like from the band. ALthough it's a great idea to throw some pop songs on cd to get some hits! But this can't hold up as well as much of the bands stuff for sure. They need to put out a solid effort of noncovers for sure and lets hope they do. Even though steven tyler is a hit on american idol in 2010-12 , we still haven't seen new songs except for 'bobo' which was a covers effort. Come back boys with some good stuff!"
3,"Umm, okay","I consider myself a true Aero-phile, but I just can't get into this album. This may change in time, but right now, it is far from being my favorite (which is Pump). I don't really like the progressive sounds with the drum machines, electronically distorted vocals and generally over-produced sound. For Aerosmith, I like them best when they sound raw. This one is a little too polished for my liking. Don't get me wrong, this album is better than most other bands' best efforts. There are some really good songs on the disc (Just Push Play {F'in A! - my favorite}, Sunshine, Drop Dead Gorgeous). This one just seems to be more flash than substance."
5,I Love it!,"I have just finished listening to the whole CD, I really think its one of Aerosmith's best! I love this group they are just like the energizer bunny they just keep going, going, and going, definitely like a fine wine they get better with age! I would highly recommend it!"
1,Zero stars is more like it.,"What was one of the best American hard rock bands of the seventies has become PURE BUBBLEGUM. As far as I'm concerned, this is Britney Spears, this is Backstreet boys, and yes folks, this is 50 Cent. Aerosmith actually treats us to a rap song on this album. A rap song. From ""Sweet Emotion"" and ""Dream On,"" and many more legendary songs from when I was a kid to just another Bubblegum band with videos stuck in between Beyonce and (GASP) Eminem."
1,A Nice Coaster,"The fact that these artifacts are still selling records completely baffles me and leads me to believe that music is at its nadir. This album, and for that matter any record released by these desiccated organisms after Permanent Vacation, is complete and utter rubbish; corporate rock at its very worst...1 star and complete contempt."
2,More of the Same,"How many of these albums can Aerosmith put out? Hell, I'm not even really a fan of anything they've done since they burned out in the late 70's, but I remain a curious observer. They were really rolling in success in the late eighties and the first half of the nineties, but now they are clearly hanging on to mainstream approval by a thread. And reproducing (or trying to reproduce) ""Pump"" every four years is definitely not helping...nor is chasing the next big musical trend. Hey Aerosmith, try being yourselves, dropping the hired songwriters, or maybe it's time to just focus on your still razor-sharp live performances. Your latest albums have sounded tired and embarrasing though, mostly due to your desparate need to rule the charts every few years, and perhaps because you've already covered just about all the musical territory you could hope to in your career as a single unit. Give it rest, or focus on your strenghts. All records like this do is cloud up your live act."
5,An honest review by a diehard fan,"If you're a mild Aerosmith fan, this may not be for you. I have loved this band since I knew what music was and I LOVE this cd. I expect it's gotten some poor reviews for a reason. I can see how it might not appeal to some. I was skeptical upon first listen (starting with track 4-the first 3 are phenominal by any standard). Then, every time I put it in, another song grew on me. It wasn't until I went on vacation for a week and then came back home that I had a monster craving to hear the cd. And it seriously satisfied. It sounds nothing like anything they've done, but it's still easily recognizable Aerosmith. You can't really explain it unless you Just Push Play. (I know that was cheesy, I apologize)."
1,Just Give It Up!,"This is the album that Aerosmith should have never made. Other than"" Jaded"", this album has nothing to it but bland filler. I'm not sure what direction they were trying to go in, but it didn't work. If this is the best they have in them, they're done. Embarrassing!"
1,JUST PUSH STOP AND EJECT!,"Aerosmith it is time to R E T I R E!""Jaded"" is a good single, not great, but it sounds like the last mediocre rock you put out.For the rest of the album, its just ""Jaded"", no pun intended, it all sounds the same with no real standout songs.Can we have another ""Walk This Way""?......The album cover art is all fluff again with no real substance.One of the worst albums of 2001."
3,pushing play...,"As soon as you start listening to this album you notice that there is a lot of keyboards and lots of computer effects involved.If you love the old 70's Aerosmith, you won't like this... but I kept my mind open to them.The first track is really good, maybe it should have being the single for this album. It's hard rocking and still sounding modern while keeping Aerosmith's sound.Just Push Play is pretty interesting, good riffing and plenty of ""walk this way"" resemblence.Jaded was the single, a demi-ballad-hard-rock song. It's good, maybe a song that should have being on Nine Lives.None the less, that's where the album starts falling. The following songs are just not that good. Passable at the best.I enjoyed ""fly away from here"" and ""drop dead gorgeous"" but that's about it.For Aerosmith, a let down, for music in general a good album and you should own, just so that you can make your own assumptions out of it.Highlights: Jaded, Beyond Beautiful"
4,Grade B,"I was not expecting this cd to be that good, after listening to NINE LIVES, but a strnge thing happened before this release, their song I DON'T WANT TO MISS A THING. I knew there maybe hope for this group yet, again. The cd starts out with a bang, and keeps going, with JUST PUSH PLAY being one of their best rockers in a while. Production was tight, with a twist of newness to it. The songwritng is above par too. For the most part there is nothing outstanding on this cd, but there is nothing bad either."
4,The UK version is MUCH better,"Overall, I was pleased with this CD - true, it wasn't ""Classic Aerosmith"", but that's what made it great. It had a gritty hard sound to it - tracks like Trip Hoppin' and Light Inside were the more hard edge songs and Luv Lies was cute with the yodel at the end. Drop Dead Georgeous was great, but that's because I'm partial to Joe Perry.The UK version offered an extra track called Face, which was overall my favorite. You should check it out..."
3,Aerosmith IS STILL THE BEST!,"After 4 years of touring and with their last album ""Nine Lives"" it was time for Aerosmith to go back to the studio. Together Joe Perry and Steven Tyler wrote 12 new tracks.They came out with great tunes like the hard rock track ""Just Push Play"" (w/ Steve singing some lyics like a Jamaican), ""Jaded"", ""Luv Lies"", ""Avant Garden"" and my favorite the ballad ""Fly Away From Here"". This album is about love, passion, rock and roll, and proves no matter how old Aerosmith gets they will still be on top and you haven't seen nothing yet."
5,The Bad (Boneyard) Boys From Boston Still Got It!!!,"What can I say...WOW!!! The ""Boneyard Boys"" still got it. Some of this album is so reminiscient of the early days. The opening track ""Beyond Beautiful"" starts out with that old '4x4 on the floor' bluesy rock beat and is followed by the fast funky/blues title track ""Just Push Play"". I can just see Steve doing his little ""Walk This Way"" shuffle across the stage during the bridge! Some of MY favorites are ""Fly Away From Here"" which was probably 'touched' by an ""Angel"" (Permanant Vacation), ""Under My Skin"", ""Luv Lies"" a song that expresses victory over the pain of love in the fast lane. Others are: ""Outta Your Head"", ""Drop Dead Georgeous"", and ""Avant Garden"" which has an interesting spiritual side. Overall, this band displays more spunk, spice, and spirit after 30 years in the biz than most of its contemporaries. Mick and Keith could take a cue."
3,"Autograph called, they want there cover art back!","The albums 2nd and third tracks are good. I really enjoy the hip-hoppish mix on Just Push Play. If you listen to rock, then youve probably heard jaded. The rest of the album I would probably throw back. There are a few ho-hum tracks that are drug-induced beatles throw back wana be songs, one with Joe singing. Overall, its a nice item to add to the Aerosmith collection, but not a crown Jewel. [....]"
1,What happened to the rock and roll?,"This album is a prime example of what happens to old rock stars who are quickly heading down the hill. The record execs must have been sleeping for this one to get through them and out into the public. I was very disappointed. The only track I can bare to listen to is the title track, and that doesn't even sound like aerosmith. Sorry guys, looks like the good music got left behind in the early nineties and got replaced by this noise."
2,"As a huge Aerosmith fan,I 'm very dissapointed in this album","I own every Aerosmith album in their discograhy and I must say this is their worst album since... well its their worst album period. ""Just Push Play"" just lacks balls. Its is full of half fast radio friendly songs that will soon be forgotten. Nothing on this album really rocks. (Beyond Beautiful is an exception but this track is wimpy compared to some of the classics).Don't get me wrong, I'm not against radio hits, most of Aerosmiths previous hits are still classics you can enjoy years later. Unfortunatly after a few plays ""Just Push Play"" will just gather dust.Instead, spend your money on ""Rocks"" or ""Toys in The Attic"" or ANY other album in Aerosmith's back catalogue."
4,just push play again and again,"i really enjoyed this album . jaded is a great is great song.i also like the title track . there are a couple of sappy love songs , but i would say it is a great album.they come up with some really cools sounds and rockin beats . this cd sounds very up to date. i like it alot"
3,"Great music, but different target audience than past albums","As someone who has every Aerosmith album, this one was not what I expected at all. Too much pop, rap, and funk to put it in the same category as ""Pump"" or ""Nine Lives"".Musically, these guys are still nailing it. There are just songs that you wouldn't know it was Aerosmith playing until you hear Steven's voice. Definitely preview before buying."
5,Cool,"I wanna knock Steven Tyler to the floor. Then I wanna punch Joe Perry in the face. Then I wanna kick Brad Whitford in the sweets. Then i wanna slap Tom Hamilton across the face. Finally I wanna yell as loud as I can in Joey Kramer's ear. By the way, this album is the best one this planet has ever produced."
3,JUST PUSH PLAY,"Like i said, this cd is good, not exelent. Aerosmith today is so comercial and is gettin' pop.... I am an fan since 1970, when I heard Dream On. In this cd i like BEYOND BEAUTIFUL, JADED, FLY AWAY FROM HERE. The other ones arent cool. but, if ya are a fan, buy it"
3,"No Miracles, but a Few Surprises","Long past the point where we can expect miracles of them, Aerosmith, on their 13th studio release Just Push Play, still have the power to surprise. JPP isn't as good as latter day releases like Pump and Get a Grip, but it's a far cry from the wan Nine Lives. Skip track one, ""Beyond Beautiful"", with its Zeppelin-esque strings (only about 25 years too late, guys), and get straight to the ""Walk This Way"" re-write of the title track. Before you complain about reliving past glories, notice that your foot is tapping and your head is banging. This is Shaggy as metal god, and that's not such a bad thing. ""Jaded,"" the first single, is a great Beatles cop. ""Under My Skin"" pops and crunches (just how leathery is your skin, Steven, that a girl can live in it?) And, of course, there are ballads; some wonderful (""Luv Lies""); some not (I especially dislike ""Fly Away from Here""). Across the board, the rock is primo, the mid-tempo is high grade, and everything else varies in quality."
4,They're Back.....,"I found this Aerosmith album great to listen to. This album (in my opinion) has some touches of the 70's Aerosmith but for the most part as the touches of their 80's - 90's formulation. Some of the stand out tracks include ""Jaded"", Avante Garden"" ""Luv Lies"" "" and ...Away from Here"". It is quite impressive that Aerosmith has remained together for as many years as they have and as long as they continue pumping music like this, I will certainly be listening and buying the music. It certainly is worth the time and the money."
2,"I'm Peter Pan..Oh, I mean Steven Tyler, pleased to meet you.","Go ahead and click the button that says this review is no help to you. If you do, you're most likely the teenage queen this album is trying to appeal to. MTV here we come. If you don't, then either: A. You grew up with Aerosmith B. Remember when they wrote their own songs C. Jammed with Joe Perry's guitar solos when they were not buried in the mix. D. Just wish these guys would rock again. Save your money and just play ""Get Your Wings"" until you Aerosmith mojo is satisfied. Later..."
2,Stay away from this one!,This is NOT one of Aerosmiths better efforts. Even the radio track is only fair. The rest of this CD is very mediocre.
2,To the guy below me...,"...Aerosmith isn't even a 1000th of what they used to be in the 70's, and even then they wern't that great, thry were just boring @$$ed emotional rock. now they are corprate rock at its worst. i'm from the boston area and i really wish we had better bands to represent our city,we have all crap while L.A. had g n r, texas has had SRV and zz top, seatle had nirvana,ect. i really coild not understand the facination with areosmith, they are fre king bubblegum rock."
3,aerosmith you ain't dead yet,"someone tell me why aerosmith is still singing, drives me crazy, okay so kid rock revived your career a gain, please do not walk this way again, please i hope aerosmith retires soon."
1,Grotesque,"The mighty have fallen.I've stuck with them for the last time. I'm giving up on them, because they did the same. Aerosmith is dead.Maybe they're happier being clean and sober. Maybe Steven Tyler has decided that it's time to be a mellow, go-along-to-get-along Top 40, tweeny-pop kind of guy. Maybe they need walkers.Whatever it is, this ain't Aerosmith. Noting ballsy, rude, or raw in this collection of corporate sludge. Avoid it like the plague."
3,Time to retire?,ya know I have been playing the drums to Aerosmith since 74 and am a huge fan but I wonder if its time to stop. They still kick live but I haven't heard anything raw in so long. Even Nine Lives had Somethings Gotta Give but the new one is aimed at radio airplay. The songs are enjoyable but too many weak ballads and just no evolution. Its like they got together and put about a months work into it to fulfill their recording obligation. I know it is much to ask to get back to the basics but what happened to slow stuff like Seasons of Wither? They are still my favorite band of all time and the talent is beyond reproach. I think Nine Lives was every bit as good as this one but doesn't compare to Pump or Toys. Just my opinion so don't get all riled up as I will be in the front row this summer.
4,still rockin',"aerosmith are one of those bands that countinue to rock though out the years. i'm sort of a new fan but i've heard some of their older stuff. ""just push play"" rocks out from start to finish. this is straight up rock and roll but with pop sencabilities. steven tyler continues to write his oh so clever lyrics and belts out those signature screams. a great pop/rock album. faves are:""beyond beautiful"", ""just push play"", ""jaded"", ""trip hoppin"", ""sunshine"", ""luv lies"", ""outta your head"" and ""drop dead gorgeous""."
3,Still Rocks,"This CD is still very good compared to a lot of rubbish out there now. I hear people complain that their not as good as 15-20 years ago but common give the guys a break. There old enough to be my grand parents. I'm still so happy there around because there isn't any good rock music around anymore.This continues in a similar direction to Nine Lives which I think is a Damn fine Album. However there isn't enough meat on the bone on Just Push Play as there was in Nine Lives however there still is enough to keep one satisfied. Best Tracks are Beyond Beautiful-4 stars, Fly Away From Here- 5 stars, Jaded-4 stars, Luv Lies 5 Stars, Under my Skin - 4 Stars, Drop Dead Georgrous 3 & 1/2 Stars. LIGHT INSIDE 4 & 1/2 Stars, is a rockin track and sounds like it belonged on the Nine Lives Album which was more rockier and heavier."
2,Disappointing,"After hearing Jaded, perhaps I expected too much from Just Push Play. Unfortunately there were only two songs that really stand out (in a good way) to me.Jaded is a great song. The title track is also an outstanding rocker that really gets you ready to enjoy this album. Unfortunately the good ends there.Ok, I understand that the RUN DMC Aerosmith collaboration on Walk the Way in 1986 set the stage for the rap-rock of today, but that is no excuse for Outta My Head. A horrid rap-rock hybrid that is one of the few Aerosmith songs that I actually skip when listening to any of their albums.If you are an Aerosmith completist, you'll want this. If you like pop music only, you might enjoy this one. If you are looking for a great Aerosmith album, you will not find it with Just Push Play."
4,Very Exciting,"This is a great cd. If you don't have it, u ain't no Aerosmith fan. Songs like Jaded and Beyond Beautiful, are just plain AWSOME. Just Play is very great. Fly Away From Here is probably the song on the cd. The others, I don't care for much. This one of my favorite albums. It's a MUST have!!"
4,A good one of Aerosmith album,"Just Push Play - It's nothings change much on music of this album of Aerosmith but this is a good one. All thing tell ""this one have to keep. And now - Hero of this release is ""Jaded"" . but form this point I can say this album may on match with the aerosmith best ""Toys in the Attic"""
3,"Not their best, but not bad for some guys in their 50's!!","For any artist to be around 30 or so years and still make music that can merit radio play and be considered relevant is nothing short of remarkable.""Just Push Play"" is not their best album - and you shouldn't expect it to be - but it's not their worst either.The one stand-out on the album is the first track, ""Beyond Beautiful"" which is the classic overpowering Aerosmith rock song. ""Fly Away From Here"" is more representative of the 90's power-ballad Aerosmith, which also makes up more than half the album.Some songs here - ""Trip Hoppin"" for one - lack the power that Aerosmith packs when they're at their best. Overall, however, not a bad effort."
4,A Pop and Enjoyable Push-Play,"Being not so a huge fan, I have known Aerosmith only through 70's classcic Dream On and Permanent Vacation and recent huge hit ""I Don't Want To Miss A Thing"". Just Push Play to me is a nice extension of ""Miss A Thing"" and some influence from their rival Cheap Trick and similar in style to Enuff'Z Nuff's recent album ""Ten"". To be honest if I were blindfolded and listen to this album I would recognize this as one of EZN stuff. This album will not bore you if you like mainstream American pop rock and Beatles. My favorites besides hit tunes are Outta Your Head and Sunshine. Essential for 80's rock fans."
4,The Hits Just Keep Coming,"Who woulda thunk it? It seems a lifetime ago that I watched Aerosmith live as they underwent a slow self distruction. The excesses of a big rock band were apparently too much for them in their youth, but as they speed headlong towards the Geritol era, we see that this band has tenacity of spirit. I guess some of us old folks were born to rock and this disc is living proof to that. Hats off to the band. The songs are good to excellent, the sound is punchy and clean and it appears that the guys might be around a while. Rock on!"
2,aerosmith---just coasting from the hall of fame,"aerosmith can write good material and several track are very fine indeed, however a few tracks does not make a good cd. where did our east coast rock machine go to anyway?--bring back that swagger and sex appeal. when you have gloss and 40 million overdubbing track machines and trying to meld into today multifaceted levels of music--you somehow lose the soul of what you truly are.---aerosmith has done just that!---its generic, glossy and downright boring. ... there is also, a blip of something about 30 seconds after the so-called last track. take my advice and write the band and tell them to quit trying to appeal to all consumer and get back to ballsy rock and crunching roll. --this tripe is shameful, from a HALL OF FAME band. I actually feel cheated from this purchase... also, just remember --I am also an AEROSMITH fan---but this is a bad release.----aerosmith has just had their wings clipped---jh"
1,Just buy their old stuff,"I'm not sure when it happened, but Aerosmith has become a nostalgia act. They are no longer relevant artists. At least they stayed fresh longer than their peers (especially the rolling stones, who became a joke before the eighties began.) The saddest thing is that they recognise this, and you can hear their desparation in this record. They are way old, but they attempt to connect with a young generation of fans that want nothing to do with them. I wish they would have aged gracefully like bob dylan or neil young, but they were always too pop for that.If they really want to matter today, Aerosmith should jump on the garage-rock bandwagon. They could follow madonna's lead and keep changing with the times. They attempt to do that by throwing in a pinch of contemporary influence, but it isn't enough. They just aren't hip or bold enough to make important changes.Avoid this record, but get yourself one an old Aerosmith record you haven't picked up yet."
2,You Call These Lyrics?,"Sorry folks, this one just doesn't cut it. It sounded o.k. on the first few listens, but after that it becomes apparant just how thin this album is, especially when compared to newer efforts such as ""Pump"" or ""Nine Lives."" Why do so many of the songs sound forced, almost like the band is trying too hard? Musically, the album is not bad considering the other junk out there today, but lyrically, it's horrible. With the exception of ""Jaded"" and one or two other tunes on the album, the lyrics are totally lacking in substance."
2,ban aerosmith from producing their own albums,"I bought this when it was first released. I listened to it twice when I got it home and I've listened to it twice since then.It's horrible.I only like one song, Fly Away From Here.The rest is nothing great.Maybe it's just too 'pop' for me."
3,Remember when Aerosmith was a ROCK BAND?,"I guess they peaked with ""Pump"" in 1989. The boys in the band are still excellent musicians, but they seem to have lost the hard-rockin' drive that built them. ""Just Push Play"" is just another of their ""safe"" rock records -- not terribly heavy and not too interesting. With their new Columbia Records contract worth tens of millions of dollars, the band and the label want to make sure there are some airplay-able singles on the record, and JPP has a couple of radio-friendly tracks, but nothing that comes close to their potential. I doubt anyone would consider this CD one of Aerosmith's best. Listen to the ""Toys In The Attic"", ""Pump"", or ""Greatest Hits"" CD's, and then you will be reminded how pale ""Just Push Play"" is by comparison."
4,good album,"I listen to it again and again. Is it their best? No. Is it worth listening to? Yes. some good tunes on here that should be checked out if you like the more ""modern"" Aerosmith."
2,There's Jaded here,"And then not a whole lot more.Maybe Beyond Beautiful and Avant Garden are the other decent tracks.Oh baby what a major league disappointment!!!I expected a lot more from this album after listening to Aerosmith from the 70's,late 80's/early 90's.I don't get the hype about Trip Hoppin either,I did not particularly care for that song very much at all.Come on Aerosmith,you're WAY better than this!!!"
4,Don't stop a rockin'!,"Aerosmith was once called 'the poor man's Rolling Stones'. You've come a long way, baby! The beauty of Aerosmith is that they keep on redefining themselves. They were among the hardest rockers in the 70's until they drugged up & bottomed out. The 80's revived their career & showed us a more creative, if not poppy, side to this group. They continued this style into the 90's & it served them well. Now in the 2K's, Aerosmith has evolved once again & shows off it's new wings with ""Just Push Play"". The title track is the best on the album & one of their best tunes over all. ""Jaded"", ""Sunshine"", & ""Trip Hoppin'"" get you moving & dancing with their UP-beats. It's near impossible to listen to this album with out it lifting your spirits. Even the more sedate ballad ""Fly Away From Here"" avoids the sap of some of the songs off of ""Get A Grip"".You want a great album to wake you up & keep you moving & feeling good? ""Just Push Play""."
4,Worth The Play,"Aerosmith has certainly evolved quite a bit when they first came on the scene in the early seventies. The early Aerosmith was noted for ear grabbing guitar riffs, raunchy vocals, and a loud sound. Where the raunchiness is certainly front and center, the guitar playing is buried too much beneath the supporting string arrangement. Gosh let Joe and Barry crank up their amps and play. None the less, the songs for the most part are very catchy. Beyond Beautiful, Outta Your Head, and Fly Away From Here have some very catchy hooks. And I love the scratching effect on the title track and the atmosphere on Drop Dead Goregous. Aerosmith shows the willingness to continue to experiment. This has made them a great success in the changing popular music world. Therefore, Just Push Play and Enjoy!"
4,"Read a mystery ,find a clue!","this Adams'Wood mystery has a wonderful Mouse named holmes and his sidekick Watson Mouse and if you look closely the clues are in the wonderfully illustrated pictures, Find a clue and love the wonderful animals ."
2,Think twice before buying,"This book didn't measure up to Quinn's usual standards. The humor falls flat, the guilt that both characters feel for their romance is agonizingly tedious and never-ending, and the plot line is weak. I was bored. Don't bother spending money on this one."
2,A Disappointment!,"Ok, I have to agree with some of the other people who read this book: it was a disappoint. I was really looking forward to Francesca's story because in the other books, she did seem witty, funny, and mischievous. As one woman said, I too did not see any of those qualities in this ""Francesca"". Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Julia Quinn, she is one of my all time favorite writers. I literally run to the nearest book store whenever one of her books is released, however, this was one time I actually considered going back to the bookstore so that I could return this book and get my money back. To be honest, I didn't even finish reading this book because both Francesca and Michael got on my nerves, I just couldn't enjoy thier story. Take my advice ladies: read the other books in this series, especially Benedict's story (simply the best book i have ever read!) and skip ""When He Was Wicked"". i doubt you would miss much."
2,must have for die-hard fans only?,"I love Julia Quinn. I did not love this book. I almost felt like it was written by someone else! Who is this Francesca? I felt like she was a total stranger and that I would have enjoyed the book better if it were not a ""Bridgerton"" book! The characters were a bit depressing and although the sex was steamy and enjoyable, it didn't seem to fit with the style of writing as the others in the series....of course I'll read it again to give it another shot, it is after all by one of the best authors in the genre..."
5,Really Good,"Next to the ""The Duke and I"" this book was my favorite in the Bridgerton family series. I absolutely fell in love with the hero, Micheal Stirling. While in past installments of the Bridgerton family books, Francesca was known in the family to display a sly humor and dry wit, I felt that Micheal possessed these traits in the book. (However,I forgive Francesca because throughout much of the book she was wracked by first sorrow, then guilt).Micheal was a fabulous hero, at times I had to laugh at his self-deprecating humor and other times I felt my heart clench because of the guilt he feels for loving his cousin's wife. To those who know and love the Bridgertons, Colin makes an appearance, and I loved how Julia Quinn brought him back to play the ""matchmaker.""Overall, if you love Julia Quinn and her past books, then you will not be disappointed by this book. It's funny, heart-wrenching at times, and very very sexy.Happy Reading!"
5,A Must Have!,"The emotional trauma (""meat"" some would say) is the very reason I gave this book the final and fifth star. Where so many other books deal in humor and witty repartee, the sadness and guilt bring depth to the characters that I had not seen before. It is a must read for all fans of Julia Quinn, Victoria Alexander etc. I only have one small qualm, and that is I feel that Francesca, for all her intelligence, drags somewhat in the end. However, potential reader, this is not enough to lessen its 5 star quality! Enjoy!"
1,Not worthy of the Bridgerton name,"If there is one problem I have with Julia Quinn, it is that she is milking the Bridgerton series for all that it is worth. The other books of the series were filled with light, love and laughter. This book is just depressing. It might have been good except for one detail. Like ""An Offer from a Gentleman,"" readers had no idea who the main character was. Francesca has always jsut been a sidenote, and Eloise's sidekick. When Quinn decided to give her her own novel, she should have given us a Bridgerton we actually wanted to care about. At least she gave Benedict depth and an interesting view on his life. The only noticeable thing about Francesca is her quietness. The book was bland boring and frankly a waste of any true Bridgerton fans time. I hope Hyacinth's book will be better"
1,Boring Crap!,"Oh my....... I usually read all of Julia Quinn's book, especially this series. This book is BORING!! I don't want to finish it. This one is worse then To Sir Phillip With Love; which was also a bad book. I have had this book for 2 weeks and it is just sitting on my shelve. Usually it takes me only 1 day to finish a book. I would tell you to not waste your money like I did. I think well known authors are sometimes in a rush to just get a book publish that they don't write good books. They think there name alone will sell the book. It seems to be the situation with this book. Francessca has no personality whatsoever and Michael is not that much better."
3,A struggle to finish,"I, like other reviewers, found this book difficult to finish! I usually get into JQ's books and finish them in one night! This book was different. I found Francesca to be quite boring and to have the book open with her husband's death was a quite downer! It seems like no matter how many times JQ tried convey that Francesca was getting over her husband's death, it seemed to overshadow her and Micheal's romance. I did finish it (about a week after I started) but I was not overly impressed."
3,Not one of my favourite Quinn novels,"I usually love Julia Quinn and have been an avid follower of the Bridgerton series. However, I didn't enjoy this book as much as the others in series. Basically, Michael has been in love with Francesca Bridgerton from the moment he met her, but she was in love with another man - his cousin! She marries John and when he dies several years later, Michael inherits and then flees to India. He returns four years later and is still in love with her, however she doesn't feel the same. She wants to have a baby so returns to society to find a husband and the story goes from there.I found the whole story to be a bit hard to get into as Francesca doesn't feel any romantic feelings for Michael and it's all rather dull for many chapters. I also found Francesca to be a bit of a painful and very confused women. She also puts Michael through hell, and I doubt many men would actually stay around so long as he does!Overall, ok, I read it to the end, but was not over enthralled."
5,my favorite of all JQ's novels,"This is a book I have read thousand times, Francesca and Michael's story isn't easy, but is one of the most emotional, heart-breaking stories I have ever read. I simply love it!It is darker than the rest of the Bridgerton novels, and the characters are more complex, and this is why I think so many people struggle through this book. But I think for that reason it is one of JQ's more interesting romances. She usually writes romantic comedies, but this is decidedly a romantic drama. But there is a HEA. And ultimately I found it satisfying."
2,Boring,"Boring boring boring, I still do not think Julia Quinn wrote this book since it's a far cry from her preceding novels excluding Hyacinth's story which was just as boring.I could not get into this story, while I like to find out what happens to other members of the Bridgerton Family, Francesca story is one I could have done without.Sorry I cannot offer more and if you don't think this review is helpful and you absolutely need to read this book then that is fine, just don't spend more than a penny on a used copy."
1,Was this tale written by a substitute?,"Where is Lady Whistledown? Where is the wit and humor of Julia Quinn's other Bridgerton romances? This novel was far too full of lust and sex, and had little to recommend it. Ms. Quinn has written other novels that stood out from others of this genre, but this one sinks back into the muck of pure sex and nothing else. Read this if you must to continue the Bridgerton saga, but otherwise, find another author or reread one of her earlier books. BTW, I gave it one star because ""no stars"" was not an option. I am really disappointed in this book! Julia: leave out so much sex and get back to the lively writing of your earlier novels."
1,Did not like it at all.,"This is the first book I read of Mrs. Quinn, and it really was a disappointment, and very boring. I did not like the characters, nor the parliaments between them, nor the gist, not even the description of the historical frame in which the story develops -too incredible for my taste, if I may say so-. I really wasted my money and my time, purchasing and taking the time to read it."
1,So bad that I almost didn't finish it.,"I adore Julia Quinn's books, but this is definitely the worst installment in the Bridgerton series.I was intrigued by the mystery surrounding Francesca, and couldn't wait to read this book. The plot outline is interesting, but the characters, especially Francesca, were not developed. The author kept SAYING that Francesca was witty, but I never read a witty statement coming from her. She kept repeating herself over and over. The author SAID there was chemistry between the two main characters, but I never felt it. And Francesca's appearances with the other characters felt contrived -- she was written into a ball that I don't recall her being present at in the other books.I skimmed the last half of this book just to get it over with."
1,Slow & Boring,"This book is soooo boring and slow I don't even want to finish it. I am disappointed b/c I really like this series. The last book was also not up to par, but this one is worse. Or is it just me? I probably wil finish it b/c I already started on it. I think that well known authors sometimes rush to get their books published so they don't put as much into it as they usually do. I think this is the case with book with this book. Again, it was not up to par."
1,Julia's Showing the Strain,"Of trying to keep up with not only her Bridgerton series, but also the novellas she's producing.I used to thoroughly enjoy sitting down with a Quinn book, and I'm not a romance fan. Her dialog was witty; her characters (while certainly not believeable) were entertaining; her grammar and syntax were correct.This book, however, seems like it was tossed off with about as much care as a 9th grader gives to an unwelcome English composition. The dialog is leaden, the character development stale, the story trite.Julia, it's probably time to re-assess your commitments and re-focus on your writing. Otherwise, you're going to fall into producing the same drab drivel as 95% of all other romance writers. You're too good for that."
1,YAWN!,"Actually I haven't read this book. I quit reading Quinn after the Benedict book because they were becoming BORING! Well, I did read the Colin and Eloise (I think it was her!) stories but found them incredibly tedious.I loved Quinns earlier books - How to Marry a Marquis, and even the Daphne Bridgerton story. But after Daphne things really went downhill.Julia Quinn needs to bid adieu to the Bridgertons and find some characters we care about. The Bridgertons as a whole were entertaining. As single entities they're rather pale and have not much depth, which in turn makes for a very boring read.I've glanced at this book a couple times in the store, in fact read a few pages and put it down again. I'm saving my money!"
1,Disappointing,"I hate to say this about one of my favorite authors, but I found this book so boring that I really had to force myself to finish it. I kept on reading in the hope that SOMETHING would happen, it never really did. There were no mini climaxes, or even a major one. The whole premise was so predictable and the characters and writing rather flat, with none of JQ's usual humor or interesting twists. I'm glad I got this one from the library, I won't add it to my bookshelf."
3,When He Was Wicked,This book wasn't as good as a thought it would be. I've read the whole series and this book was my least fav. It was kinda boring nothing really exciting you knew what was going to happen.
2,Depressing,"Although i do love this author, i must say this book is awfully depressing, i mean first she looses her husband, and then finally when she finds love again the hero has malaria? and in the end your left wondering whether or not he will be healthy and whether or not they will ever have a baby. all in all i was quite dissapointed in this one, because i feel the basic storyline has alot of promise."
2,very disapointed,"Love at first sight. Sounds great, but if there isn't some substance to back it up it falls apart, right? That's what happened to this book. It fell apart. Michael falls in love with Fran at first sight. But why? She was boring! She had no zest for life, no quick wit--she was just kinda there. I was left with no idea what Michael fell in love with besides Fran's blue eyes!The first half of the book was tragic and the last half was flat. It was very predictable with no twists or turns to the plot that could have made it memorable.I'm really glad that this was not a hardcover release because I would have bought it and been out $25 instead of $8.I really hope that Quinn's mix of humour and sensuality are back in her next novel. 'When He Was Wicked' was a real let down."
3,promising but didn't deliver,"Francesca is not my favorite of the Bridgerton sisters. She's very aloof and that makes it hard to feel much of anything for her. I did like Michael as a character, but I'm not sure Francesca deserves him. And I thought the part of the book where they are having non-stop sex while he attempts to woo her, just ridiculous. If she truly felt so guilty about her dead husband, wouldn't those feeling extend to sleeping with his cousin? Disappointing."
5,How do you know?,Q. How do you know when a book is good?A. When there's tear stains on the last page.
4,2nd epilogue is great read,I think the Bridgerton series is great-and wanted other JQ fans to know that she has written several e-books that follow the stories down the road but they aren't here on amazon (?????) I found them at ereader-and I don't plug other sites but fans will loves these mini sequels. Most are about 130 pages. enjoy!
2,Disappointing effort,"This story was a too different from the other Bridgerton novels for my liking. It was hard to believe that Francesca even was a Bridgerton. The story started off well, but it stalled and lost my interest when the story just didn't progress. Lacking a story, Quinn was forced to turn the last third of the book into one sex scene after another. I also felt there were too many loose ends at the end of the book that were not tidied up. All in all, I thought both the hero and the heroine did not measure up. More interaction with the rest of the Bridgerton clan would have helped the tired plot and lack of spirited diaglogue."
3,Not my Favorite Bridgerton Book,"I will begin by saying that I am very big fan of Ms. Quinn and of course, of her Bridgerton series. I started at the beginning with Daphne's story, The Duke and I, and worked my way through each book, always waiting anxiously for the next to come out. I have read all of them numerous times because they were so enjoyable, all except When He Was Wicked, which has remained on my bookshelf collecting dust since the first time I forced myself to read the whole thing.In this story, I honestly felt like the author spent 3/4 of the book trying to convince the reader why a relationship between its main characters, Francesca and Michael, would be wrong. Well, she convinced me. So when the time came for them to finally be together, I was not happy or excited, I felt fairly disinterested.It is always nice to revisit the other Bridgerton family members, and Ms. Quinn did not disappoint there, but I could not get over my lack of interest in Francesca and Michael's relationship."
3,Too much sadness....,Way too emotional. Not the kind of book that gives the warm fuzzies.Lack of sexual chemistry between the main characters.I gave it three stars because Ms. Quinn always writes beautifully. I just like stories that are lighter and happier.
2,Lighten up Julia Quinn!,"A lot of previous reviewers have noted that this book seems almost as if it was written by someone else. I agree. If someone handed me this book with no cover to it, I would think Lisa Kleypas wrote it. The characters were moody and the whole tone of the book was darker than her usual light & witty stories. I hope in her next book she writes like her old self."
2,Not Memorable,"I bought this book because I really enjoyed Julia Quinn's previous works. More importantly, I was very intrigued by the storyline of a hero battling not only physical illness, but harboring guilty feelings concerning his love for his cousin's wife. The hero is gorgeous and well developed. Unfortunately, the heroine was underdeveloped and boring. I really tried, but I could not garner any interest or sympathy for Francesca. Her character came off as very flat and this affected the rest of the story. I usually LOVE to keep my books and leaf through them, but I wasn't even interested enough in this one to keep it around. I gave it away as soon as I read it."
3,Not the best of the otherwise outstanding series,"The Bridgerton series is entirely delightful, but this book stands out, with On the Way to the Wedding, as having characters that are less sympathetic and less interesting. I am definitely grading on a curve, as all of the books by Julia Quinn that I've read are excellent, engrossing, and difficult to put down. Romancing Mr. Bridgerton is a great antidote if you are disappointed with this book, though I doubt fans of the series will be able to resist reading all of the books."
4,Get one,I hate wrong time and resetting for the time change. This works fine here in west Florida. I wish I could have found an outdoor digital model.
1,A clock? More like a crock!,"I just opened my clock only to find the front rim dented and the back panel cracked in half. Regardless, since it only cost me $30, my wife talked me into putting it up regardless just to see if it worked. We followed the instructions and low and behold, after waiting 5 hours for the clock to set itself, it remains at high noon. I hit the reset button as directed and have decided to wait ""several days"" to let it ""find the Colorado radio signal"" as recommended on the box, but I presume I will be sending it back regardless. Great job La Crosse - your clock just wasted my time."
1,Abysmal Service,"If you can EVER get through, they just tell you that the battery is bad. I tested the battery and the tester said it was fully charged. Just to test it, I replaced the battery with a new battery that tested fully charged and it didn't work. I called again and was told that it still was a battery problem. Buy Timex -- their atomic clocks seem to work AND they honor their warantee!!!!"
1,Poor Quality,I purchased five units for our office less than a year ago. Three out of five are already in trash. They just stop working after few month. The radio set up didn't work for any of the five.
1,La Crosse Replaced Clocks with Bad DST,Many if not all of Lacrosse atomic analog clocks have received bad reviews on how the clocks do not adjust for DST. Other than the DST issue clock has been very accurate.Update: La Crosse sent out new clocks to replace the ones that did not adjust for DST because of the new date changes. Any company that does this is tops in my book. Changing rating to five stars.
5,"Love, love, love this clock","I'm lazy and always wait forever to update my clock for daylight savings. When I decided to replace my existing, cute Ikea wall clock with an atomic one, I wanted something that looked nice in my predominantly modern room. I was really happy with this clock's design and performance. The instructions for setup were really easy and I was thrilled when I came out after clocks changed to see that it had done its job."
2,Heads up when buying open box items.,"Although the La Crosse atomic clock was sent promptly by vendor (and I readily give the vendor mucho points for that), clock's hour hand was damaged and ""swung"" freely, was un-anchored. A bit of attention to this obvious detail before shipping could have spared both seller and buyer a lot of needless repacking and UPS back and forth. Heads up to potential buyers of ""open box"" merchandise. You often get what you pay for. More times than not, it's wiser to buy it new and ""pass"" on the ""bargain"" price and claims about something being as good as new...unless you have a lot of time to waste."
1,The hands don't line up when set at 12:00 -- The battery compartment is too tight ...,"The hands don't line up when set at 12:00, the sticker on the glass leaves a mark that's difficult to remove, the instructions are printed in very small font, difficult to read, the engraved settings on the back are rendered black-on-black; both of these faults make it difficult to set up this clock. The battery compartment is so tight that it's very difficult to insert and remove the batteries -- they don't just snap in as on most electronic equipment that uses such batteries. You need to really force them in!"
2,"Front Nice, Back is Cheapo","The front of this clock is nice and looks good for the price paid. However, whoever decided to attach the clock to the packaging it comes in with screws was really dumb. The back is a very thin and brittle plastic. Be careful when removing the packaging, I barely pulled on the clock while removing mine and the back shattered. Thankfully it still hangs and no one can see the back but it made me feel the product was very very cheap on the inside. Also the La Crosse technology didn't work (I live in a metro area so I don't think reception was the issue). As a regular clock it works fine and is easy to read."
2,Second Hand Stopped Working After 4 Months,I was using the clock in a dental office and I needed the second hand to time things. The clock kept good time but the second hand stopped running after 4 months. I would not purchase again.
2,Does not last,"Styling and overall appeal is o.k.Cheap plastic encasing of the clockwork and some wobble of the outside frame gives some hint of the overall quality of this product.The clock sets itself according to the time zone and adjusts to summer and winter time.Would have been good, but the second hand stopped working after 1 year.I suppose that's all you can expect from an electronic product these days.Overall rather disappointing."
3,Great concept but slipshod quality control,"I've had several ""atomic"" clocks and this one has a very nice appearance.Mine worked very well for about 18 months, but then it went bad - it started to act crazy, constantly resetting itself, even after using a new battery. Judging from the many other reviews, LaCrosse appears to have a serious quality control problem - the clock may arrive DOA or may last a while. Other than this review, I've never seen a review from someone who had one of these for over a year.From what I can see, the actual mechanism is pretty cheap even though the face and case look very attractive. I wish someone would make high quality atomic clocks with good warranties and customer support."
5,A Well-Researched Portrait of an Authentic Legend,"I am a John Wayne fan. I loved seeing his films as a kid when they first came out, and I consider them now to be a valuable legacy from a great actor and a wonderful man. This superbly researched and balanced portrait shows the Duke in all his humanity and complexity, as well as providing an overview of a one-of-a-kind career. I'm sorry that moviegoers today can't enjoy the experience of going into a theatre and seeing a John Wayne film on the big screen for the first time. It was nothing short of the greatest, and so was he, as a man, as an actor, and as an American who was never ashamed to speak his mind. An underrated actor whose longevity with fans is finally getting journalists to see how great a talent he was (and is), Wayne may be more popular today than ever before, thanks to video, DVD, and biographies like these. Simple justice, pilgrim!"
5,An excellent book.,I have searched far and wide for a good vegetarian slow cooker cook book for many years. This is it! So many crock pot cook books only have a small chapter on meatless recipes. Most of the (very few) veggy crock pot cook books that I have found have been terribly disappointing. This book has so many tasty recipes that I have made over and over. I've made the chocolate cake recipe many times and brought it to potlucks - no one believes me when I tell them that I made it in a slow cooker. The cacciatore is a family favorite now. A great buy.
3,techniques are good but recipes lack flavor,"While I have learned tips and techniques from this book, I have not been impressed with the flavors. The recipes lack flavor (in my opinion) and I often find myself adding a little cumin here or some smoked paprika there. For example, adding cumin to the corn chowder brings the recipe to the next level. I also disapprove of the use of canned tomatoes in some recipes, like the ratatouille. Ratatouille should capture the essence of summer and it is against the spirit of the recipe (again, in my opinion) to use canned tomatoes instead of fresh ones. In addition, the tastes of canned tomatoes is too strong compared to say, the mild zucchini or eggplant. I am not too crazy either about the use of orange juice concentrate in some recipes. I am still searching for a solid slow cooker cookbook, so please let me know if you have any to recommend :)"
4,Nice and easy,"Too many vegatarian cookbooks are difficult using ingediants I don't have on hand. This book, so far, has been simple to use and delicious results."
3,"Nice recipes,","I have yet to cook anything from this book but the recipes do look nice. My only concern it the extra stove top cooking required for many of the recipes. As a busy grad student I was hoping for a ""throw it in and turn it on"" style. Many, if not most, of the recipes call for preliminary steps such as sauteing, braising and even a bit of cooing to soften veggies. As such I don't consider this a true slow cooker cookbook. I did appreciate that the recipes seem healthy and not overloaded with cheese, cream or butter, but I won't get much use out of it during the week."
4,Comfort Food for Vegetarians!,"So many vegetarian cookbooks out there have page upon page of salads and vegetable side dishes. The one thing I found myself really craving once I stopped eating meat was warm, hearty comfort food (especially in winter) and this book was a great solution to my problem! It has 3 out of 4 of my ideal cookbook criteria: 1- a description of each recipe, 2- clear, simple ingredient lists 3-step by step instructions - but is missing one of the most important, 4- colour photos (or any kind of photo, for that matter). The recipes I've tried so far have turned out great, but being handy in the kitchen I take a lot of liberty in altering recipes to my liking, so I can't speak to someone who would use the recipe literally.Note - I actually own the French version of this book and am assuming this version is identical (with the exception of language) when reviewing it."
2,"Appealing concept, unappealing recipes","Recipes for slow cookers tend to be heavy on the meat, so I was excited to find a slow cooker book for vegetarian meals. The idea of prepping my meal in the morning and then enjoying a mellower evening appealed to me, but so far, every recipe I have tried in this cookbook has dissappointed me. Because so many have praised the book, I keep thinking I might try one more recipe, but I fear wasting valuable time and food on another bad tasting/textured meal."
3,Not what I expected... Boring recipes,"I can't even remember why I decided to get this book but all I can say is that it was not what I expected. The recipes are pretty plain, and you do have to cook some ingredients on the stove top if you want the best results (of course). We are used to more complex flavors and therefore the recipes in this book just don't cut it for our taste."
2,"Impractical, disappointing... mostly useless to me","My husband is more-or-less a vegetarian, so I was hoping for reasonably easy, practical help in making dinners for him. For my purposes, this book is pretty useless. Almost every recipe demands some exotic ingredient, unavailable in my neighborhood (couscous isn't good enough, it must be ISRAELI couscous etc); some are just disappointing, like p88 - the horrible 'Vegetarian pot au feu' that makes you wonder why vegetarians even enjoy food; and p75, a dismal'Indian, cauliflower and kidney bean stew'. p107 'Slow Spanish beans and rice' is OK. But what a basic recipe! And even this one requires that you fry up food in a skillet first.So - nothing is easy or simple with this pretentious book. If you have little time, live in an undistinguished neighborhood with ordinary supermarkets, and just want to cook healthy dinners, this is NOT the book for you. I regret buying it."
1,Vegetarian Haggis??? Puhlease!!!!!!!!!!!,"There are just too many strange and frankly unappetizing dishes in this book. It includes a recipe for vegetarian haggis! Haggis, you ask? In a vegetarian crockpot cookbook? No way. Way! Yes, Haggis, the foul Scottish dish made from sheep entrails encased in sheep gut- the bane of carnivores and vegetarians alike-- has been adapted here for the vegetarian crockpot! Yes, the vegetarian crockpot! I'm nauseated just thinking about vegetarian haggis or any haggis for that matter. Other bizarre recipes include ""Chutney-Topped Tofu Appetizer Cheesecake"" (in a crockpot? as an appetizer?? yuck). The book's ingredients lean heavily on seitan, vegetarian ""sausage,"" and other faux meats, and a medley of uncommon ingredients. I really just wanted some basic, easy, meatless crockpot soups and stews that a busy person could throw together in the morning and forget -- not what I found here."
4,temperature issues,"A good book with lots of interesting ideas, but you should make sure to know what temperatures your own slow cooker reaches. She says that low is 200 degrees F and High is 300 degrees F, but when I couldn't figure out why my potatoes were still underdone after eight hours, I checked the temperature and it turned out that my slow cooker's low is at 175 and high at 205. I understand that that is a fairly standard range though, so it's the book that's off. Anyway I still recommend it, just be careful."
4,Tip for those who hate pre-cooking,"To those who complain about pre-cooking, try a multi-cooker instead of a slow cooker. It allows you to brown in the same pot you will be slow cooking in, and also has other features like steamer and rice cooker. I don't find the pre-cooking an issue though. I don't expect to just be able to dump a ton of things in the slow cooker and have it turn out great - great recipes will generally require more work than that.No other cookbook I own has so many great recipes. I have tried probably about 20 so far and only a couple weren't worth repeating. None of them have been bad though.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I feel the recipes would benefit from having more vegetables in them (from a health and taste aspect). Also, many of the same vegetables are used in all the recipes. However, this is a minor issue because overall this is my favorite cookbook."
4,great for vegans!,"I was searching for a while for a slow cooker cookbook for vegans and finally found this one. The recipes are really good. There is a lot of seitan recipes, which is one of my favorite proteins.If you are in a hurry many could be cooked in a covered pot but the long times in the slow cooker means you could put them on in the morning and they will be ready at night.In some of the recipes I did find it a bit annoying that she wanted you to do so many things before adding the food ( grilling or browning or marinading etc) but I cant argue that the food tastes great.A word of caution. Many of the recipes call for a trivet for your slow cooker to sort of steam the food. Mine did not come with this and I have no idea where to get it!"
1,"Uninteresting recipes, low on taste. Boring.","I had such high hopes for this book based on all the positive reviews, but I must join the other 1-star reviewers. Many of the recipes are just variations on each other, and not even interesting ones at that. Often they are under-seasoned. Sometimes the author seems to throw in ingredients that don't belong (the olives in the tamale pie are awful). Also, as mentioned by another reviewer, you generally will use 1 or 2 other pots/pans while prepping recipes. I say keep shopping and try another book."
3,Decent vegetarian cooking.,"Overall I like the recipes in this book. They taste good, and I like her idea of sauteing the onions and other vegetables on high for a half hour before adding the other ingredients so that you can avoid ""cooking"" and dirtying a skillet. However, she wants too many things precooked. The sauteing is alright, but her bean recipes are too complicated. Soaking beans overnight is normal, but then she wants the beans to be slow cooked for 8 hours prior to using them in the recipe! I personally find this suggestion overkill since this means by the time the recipe is done the beans may cook for 16 hours."
4,A yuummy book,This book has complex recipes and easy recipe that only require a few ingredients that are probably already in your cupboards. She explains the techniques of slow cooking and gives plenty of helpful tips! i loved this book.
2,All recipes tried came out poorly,"This looked great in advance but my wife and I tried a number of recipes from this and mostly disliked them. The baked ziti was so-so; ditto tortilla soup. Savory vegetable bread pudding was disgusting. Polenta was not great, ditto southwestern pot pie, ditto baked beans. Cauliflower & kidney bean stew was very bad. Generally everything was unpleasantly bland. Time to drop the book off at a thrift shop for someone else to suffer from.(By comparison, we have made several things from ""The Indian Slow Cooker"" and found them delightful, so it is not just a problem with the appliance or our ability to follow instructions!)"
2,Blah,"So far I've made 3 of the recipes in this cookbook. And I don't think I'd make any of them again. I made the vegetable stock, which wound up just tasting like onions. I used the stock in the Borsht recipe, which then made the borscht taste like onion soup. Also, way too much clove in the recipe. I also made the Dal which was bland and I had to spice it up by adding in hot serrano peppers. The Dal was also NOT anything like Dal in consistency. It was just mush. I cooked both the Dal and the Borsht for the minimum cook time as called for in the book. Both were definitely overcooked, especially the Dal."
5,Excellent Vegetarian Slow Cooker cookbook,I have already made three recipes from this book and they were all delicious and perfectly seasoned. very easy to follow and very clear instructions.
2,A Huge Omission,"I purchased this book on a whim because one recipe really sounded good. It was good. And so was the second and third I tried. But this cookbook is missing one VERY important thing - there's no nutrition information or quantification of portion size. That may be OK for the person who thinks vegetarian or vegan food is always low fat or carb, but it isn't. I'm eating a balanced diet and losing weight, and a key factor in my success is tracking what I eat and paying attention to portion sizes. If I want to do that with recipes from this book, I have to calculate everything, add it up and then divide by the number of servings, which are given, but the amount of the serving isn't. One recipe of 8 servings filled my crock pot. The next one of 8 servings only filled it half full. Makes no sense. This one is going into the donate box."
1,No It Ain't,"This is not ""200 Recipes for ...One-Pot Meals"" in fact NONE of the recipes is a one-pot meal, and by far the greater number aren't even for meals, just entrees, or main dishes, or side dishes. or vegetables, or desserts, or hot drinks, or breads, etc, etc..Look elsewhere for ""Recipes for One-Pot Meals""."
5,This book saves my life!,"This is an awesome resource for busy people. We eat really healthy, delicious meals, and we are not scrambling for them at dinnertime. I love this author's books!"
5,Making nature studies fun,This is one of the best books that I ever bought when I was at college. The best part of this book is that it is simple and easy to use as a teaching tool. You can pull out one activity from this book and use it as a fun nature activity for children which is also educational.It gives children the chance to rediscocer the joy of playing in nature and it also encourges them to respect nature. It is truly amazing. It can be easily adapted to the climate that you are in. This book is truly a masterpiece.
4,Bruder Bulldozer,"Great toy for the grandchildren, I am sure it will be used alot in the year to come. Recommended to buy . It will keep the kids happy"
3,Plastic is junk,This was only an inside toy and yet it still has broken in several places. It is a well made and well thought out toy but any kid stronger than a 1 year old will eventually break it. Luckily our 3 year old hasn't been traumatized with every break and continues to use.
2,Bruder Caterpillar Track-type tractor,"I was disapointed in this toy. I expect Bruder products to be more substantial than this one. I got this for my four year old great grandson and he was excited when he first started playing with it. However, after a short period he found that it was not sturdy enough for him to move the dirt and rocks that he wanted to move. Now it sits in the dirt pile and he just plays with his Bruder Dump Truck."
3,"Fun but not very durable,",Came with small pieces for the treads which I am constantly finding all over the house. My son has fun with it but pieces keep falling off.
3,Not what I expected,I bought this toy for my 2.5 year old nephew. The description made it seem like this toy would be suitable for this age range. When it arrived I realized this toy is more for older children (4-5 yrs). It is not very large nor does it look very inviting. Too much $$ for what you get.
1,Junk Plastics Ruin a Fun Toy,"My son loved this toy, but within a couple of weeks of use outdoors pieces started snapping off and the treads would roll off the wheels on a regular basis. After a year, it's pretty much garbage, but he still likes playing with what's left of it. Fun? Yes. Durable? Not at all."
3,TOO SMALL,My son plays with it. Its much smaller than we anticipated though. He likes it. We were just not satisfied with the size.
5,Super toy.,My 4 year old loves this Caterpillar. He loves all heavy equipment and wanted one of these. Details are very good and toy seems to be very well built. The tracks on this toy is awsome. They move look and almost sound like my real track loader.
3,It is ok,"It was smaller than I thought it would be, but overall it was ok.I did not like the fact that they had pieces that had to be put on and little or no instructions."
3,Bruler,We bought this product for our young boys. It looked fun for them. It arrived and they loved it. But with in a half hour a cylinder broke and with in a hour the plastic track fell off twice. Day two half of the back fork is missing. Now on day 3 the whole front blade broke off. They love the toy even broken but I'm disappointed.
5,Conversion to rc,Bruder is the best marcking construction toys play with rc conversion tamiya truck man puching rock bruder 963 and delta tracked loader
5,Great Bulldozer,This Cat is well made and realistic. My 3 year old grandson loves pushing it (and other things with it) around the room. The tracks turn realistically and the blade will angle several ways. The size (about 14 inches long) is just right. Big enough to push around satisfyingly and small enough to store well.
5,Great details,"Amazing realistic details, so far quite durable. My son LOVES his CAT trucks. We are looking forward to getting some more."
5,Gift,I already responded to this rating but it was on the wrong account it was on the account of the person they were mailed to. But I was very pleased and my grandson love the caterpillar.
1,Dont bother.,"I had hoped that this book was going to be useful. However it is sadly out of date. It was published in the 1980's and doesnt have any of todays tech. I would recommend that you skip it and get ""How to Build Dioramas"" instead."
2,NO WAVE,"FRAT ROCK:THE 80S-VARIOUS ARTISTS:DIRTY WATER-THE INMATESWOOLY BULLY-JOAN JETTLOUIE LOUIE-BLACK FLAGNOBODY BUT ME-GEORGE THOROGOOD & THE DESTOYERSLITTLE BIT O' SOUL-RAMONESWILD THING-XI WANT CANDY-BOW WOW WOWMONY MONY-BILLY IDOLLA BAMBA-LOS LOBOSMONEY-THE FLYING LIZARDSIf the above album existed somwehere besides on my CD burner, THIS would be a better representation of FRAT ROCK: THE 80S than Rhino Records' predictable cash-in. Instead of the same old overplayed hits by Devo, Madness, and Adam Ant that can be found on any ol' new wave compilation, why not opt for actual 60s frat classics as reconfigured by rebellious artists from the 80s? Seems simple, doesn't it? I need another brewski to dull the pain...RATING: TWO LITTLE"
3,Basic 80's mix,"Frat Rock 80's style -- with past hits like the smooth, ""The Heat Is On"" and the stylish, ""Addicted to Love"", this cd has the basics. Though I like ""Our House"" from Madness, I don't know if I'd have included it on this cd...I don't think it needs to be on an album called Frat Rock, but hey, whatever works...."
2,Compassion in action,"I am deeply moved by the ability of these stories to bring such an incomprehensible act of 911 into verbal pictures in my mind of the courage and action of these women answering a call to duty.What decisions followed once upon the scene were summoned from deep within the core of compassion. Despite overwhelming odds of futility, action followed need.I find myself reviewing each story slowly, a little at a time. The horror repelling, the heroism compelling.I recomend this book wholeheartedly, and commend the authors for bringing these stories to us."
1,Lame and maudlin account of 9/11,"If you want to read a maudlin account of the terrorist attacks on 9/11, then be sure to read this skewed view of the events. The authors suggest that women are more able to open up about what happened that day, which is a bunch of nonsense. This book does not hold a candle to the few truly good books written so far on the subject."
5,Read This Book,"Harrowing, engrossing, and well-written firsthand accounts put you right beside police officers, firefighters, and paramedics on that terrible day 9/11/01 (and afterward, too). I could not put it down."
4,women at ground zero,Very good book! Amazing stories from very brave and courageous women! You Go Girls!
5,Women at Ground Zero,"As a Police Chief I was very impressed with this book. The stories were told by the women who were involved in the 9/11 tragedy. We heard from them, not someone who took literary license to write a ""better"" story. There were incredible accounts of the activities that took place that day and the woman telling it put the reader ""there"". The stories were moving, emotional and captivating. Thank you Mary and Susan for recognizing the exclusive language in our society and for bringing the efforts of our ""sister"" emergency workers to light. You should be commended. This was an excellent book and one that I will treasure always."
5,Awesome & inspiring!!!,"I loved this book! It brought out stories that I never heard in all the media blitz after this unforgettable and horrific event. It truly shows another side of the story, and yet they made it very clear that the book was ""not to diminish the contributions of the men who lost or put their lives at risk at Ground Zero"". I had hesitated and worried that this might be a ""feminist - male bashing"" viewpoint. Not at all!It rounds out the story. Something that needed to happen. I feel more of a connection with what happened now than ever before.I highly recommend this to all - men and women alike. I hope it becomes a standard for reading about women in history and should be in every home for pre-teens on up to learn more about what happened and to offer inspiration.Buy it! It's a keeper!!"
5,Classic for a reason,In Knowledge of the Holy Tozer writes with profundity and yet this is an understandable read. He challenges the reader to do the hard work of knowing and pursuing God. So grateful to read this.
4,Simple and Elegant,"Tozer does a great job of explaining He who is incomprehensible. He gives great examples of God's attributes in ways that make sense without putting God into a box, and in a way that our simple minds can grasp. This is a great source for helping to understand who God is. The only disappointment I had with it is that it does not have a lot of Scripture references, but it is still very good and very sound. If you have a desire to know God, or want to renew your relationship with Him, I would highly recommend this book."
4,Most Folks Would Do Best to Start with Scripture,My daughter - in college - thinks this book is quite useful. Glad she does - as the professor gave her little choice about it as her textbook.
5,Tozer always does a very good job in all the books he writes.,"On the subject that was the topic I found this to be the very best. I found it to be the kind ""that could not be put down."" I am presently reading another book from Amazon and I have seen more that I will be downloading.Sherwin Day"
5,Powerful!,"Just like all other Amazon kindle buys, it was a smooth transaction and reader friendly format. I found the content to be a profoundly simple commentary on what the Bible tells us about God. A great aid in helping one draw closer to the Lord through His Word."
5,A man of insight,This is the first Tozer book I have read. I was very impressed with his spiritual insight and highly recommend this book as a timeless classic. I've just placed an order for a few more.
4,AW Tozer - a higher calling,"As always with A W Tozer, he has no compromise with the world system or with us being spiritual wimps. We let wrong concepts of God soak into our thinking, and he challenges each of those and replaces them with the true God of the Bible. It's good to read something substantial from 60 years ago that is basically timeless."
5,"""Simply"" awesome...explained so beautifully!","I had no clue what to expect from this book (on CD). I heard about it when a Pastor on the radio station mentioned it and when I saw I could get it on CD I was thrilled because I drive a lot. The book itself may have been difficult for me to read and comprehend but because I was able to listen to it, back it up and listen to it again actually helped. I plan on listening to it again...and again as I know I will get more and more out of it each time. This book is beautifully written as well. More than a few times I had to turn it off and really think about what I just heard because the thought was completely worthy of my time. Awesome!"
4,Knowledge of the Holy,Another good Tozer book. All his books make me think. Clearly written from the scriptures. I will read this more than once. Not exactly an easy read but I was not looking for a noval
2,it's ok,"it seems to be fine it just bored me pretty quick. I couldn't get into it personally, of course it was the holidays and had a lot on my mind. but it seemed to be a lot of fodder and not key point based. seemed to drag on and found myself thinking of other stuff rather than what I was reading. I will give it another try later."
1,Never did receive the e-book.,Have not been able to read a book that I never received. That is about all that I have to say.
5,Quite possible the most important book outside the Bible,"The better picture you have of God, the better off your view of everything will be. Tozar's attributes will, and should, shape your mind. The Holy Spirit will speak to you through this writing. Get it!"
5,Had to make myself put it down !!!!,I grew in my faith and in my walk just from reading this book !!! A W Tozer hit this one out of the park albeit almost half a century ago !!!! I would recommend this book to anyone !!!!!!!
3,"It is a hard read,but I bought extra copies for my friends.","Mr. Tozer's writing style was of another age, but if you read this carefully, your understanding of God and what he wants from us will change your life. It brought peace to me."
5,Anthropomorphic!,"AW Tozer is the best at anthropomorshism, which is the abilit to explain the unexplainable in terms understandable. This concept is almost beyond reason but after reading ""The Knowlege of the Holy"" I have experienced it.This is the best book for those wanting to better understand God. It's also perfect for those who are struggling with their spiritual life. Tozer' gift is the ability to explain God's attributes in very simple terms.It's a timeless book. I keep several copies on hand and use them for spontaneous gifts."
5,"The Knowledge of the Holy, a Must Read for Every Christian","The Knowledge of the Holy by Tozer is a must read for every Christian. He seems to see into the heart of God and knows, as we all should, that God wants us to know Him and in knowing Him worship and serve Him. The book has short chapters each on something ""True about God"" and the essential first chapters explain why we need to think rightly about God, anything short is idolatry. As I said, the book is essential reading with an open Bible next to it for all Christians, young and old.In Jesussteve"
4,A W Tozer,"I bought the book for a friend going to Africa. I like that it was small and compact for traveling. There many markings which I didn't like at first but on such a great classic as this, it's great to get others perspective. This should be on everyone's library!"
5,Excellent writer and story in En el tiempor de las Mariposas or At the time of the buterflies,"Julia Alvarez takes us to a historic time of political dictatorship, social revolution, and development of women wrights movements in Dominican Republic during the 40's and 50's. Is is an excellent story and well written book that educates us about the struggle that all Latin American countries went through at that time in history. I highly recommend this book. You will not be able to stop reading it!!! Monica B-O"
5,un GREAT libro,"Our conversational spanish class read this book in spanish along with the english translation...a spanish ""Book club"" is a great tool for learning or brushing up the language. This marvelous book, based on true events inspired great discussion and of course we have a wealth of new vocabulary. Based on the heart wrenching story of the Maribel sisters of the Dominican Republic at the time of Tujillo the author Julia Alvarez uses great insight in presenting the woman as real human beings whose very humanity transcends the legends they have become. An absorbing read about a time most Americans know very little."
5,Historia dominicana,"Cuanto me alegra que haya una autora que cuenta parte de la historia dominicana. Me encanta como Julia escribe. Este libro esta muy bien hecho pero ojo: Julia Alvarez escribe en ingles no en español. Aun asi, me parece que la traduccion de esta historia esta estupenda."
3,Bueno,"Es una historia interesante y entretenida, sobretodo para aquellos latinoamericanos que nos interese la historia. Aunque es una novela, tiene mucho de fondo històrico. Los personajes son agradables, bien logrados. Me dejó el interés de conocer màs sobre la historia de Trujillo. No llega a la excelencia de La Fiesta del Chivo de Vargas Llosa, es una buena Historia"
5,"Kudos to ""Cries of the Orchids!""","I so enjoyed this book! One of the main characters is a mentally retarded mother of a baby boy. It is rare that a book will make me cry or laugh out loud, and yet I did both throughout this story. The suspense is killer! By the time I finished, I was an emotional wreck! (HA!)"
5,I couldn't put it down,"I have to admit, I bought this book at Amazon because I grow orchids and was tired of non-fiction. After reading the description and reviews, I realized it wasn't about orchids like I thought it'd be, but, oh, how I enjoyed it. I did figure out what was 'around the corner', but it was a delightful ride. I'm no expert, (except where my orchids are concerned, and psst.. it's cattleya) but I think Ms. Bailey did an outstanding job on her first book. I look forward to reading anything else I can find that she has written. Thank you for a very entertaining weekend!"
5,This is one awesome read!!!!,Very few books have captured my attention from the very first page the way this one has! And the ending blew me away!!
2,Nice first try...,"The author, whom I'd never heard of, solicited this review from me and took the trouble to mail me her book, so I feel compelled to be frank about it. Apparently this is Ms. Bailey's first novel. It's not the worst first novel I've ever read, but it's not great either. Only the lead character has any kind of dimension, and on many occasions the plot begs the reader to suspend any sense of reality. But that is not to say that the book could not also be entertaining at times. Bailey does have a good sense of pace and keeps the story rolling fairly quickly and even creates a few moments of suspense...but the storyline is strictly of the ""drugstore novel"" variety. The author can be very descriptive, conjuring up some strong images, but the narrative connecting those images is weak. Though the heroine remains chaste throughout the novel, in no way did I find it to be ""inspirational."" But it wasn't a bad first try at all. I'll give it a C+"
4,An enthralling tale of love and magic!,"The story really delivers its promise: this is exactly what comes to mind whenever the synopsis of a story claims that the heroine has magical healing powers!The only drawback is that Jarrett, the hero seems to be EASILY captured or injured if he's got to fight more than ONE enemy at a time, regardless of his opponents' skill. It's really rather disappointing because he appears to be a very strong (almost invincible) warrior as proved time and again when he battles opponents in the 'games' and also due to his inner strength in surviving his ordeal.Don't miss Ms. Baker's Beneath a Midnight Moon--the only other book she has written that deals with fantasy and magic."
3,Warriro's Lady,"I've enjoyed Madeline Baker's books before. I was surprised and disappointed to find the cover art didn't reflect the genre. I had chosen this particular one thinking it was Native American fiction. Instead, it was a fantasy. Oh well. It wasn't the best of her books, but I'll probably finish it anyway."
3,Not worth a second read,"I read this book many years ago when I snuck it out of my mom's book collection. I didn't remember much about it, but I thought about it over the years. I couldn't remember the name and I spent a lot of time and effort trying to track down the title, so that I could purchase it. I finally located the info and found a copy. I couldn't wait to reread it, but after reading it, I don't know what I saw in it. The story mixes in some reality with some fantasy, even though the entire story takes place apparently on another planet, but the characters are amazingly human-like. The heroine resists too much. The peaceful tribe of people the heroine comes from don't seem to have any real emotions except to be even-tempered and peaceful at all costs. Perhaps after years of reading romance novels, I have become jaded, but this book lost all of its original appeal for me, but at least now my curiosity has been satisfied."
2,Too much violence,"I am going to be very unpopular here but I'm okay with it. I could not believe the violence in this story. Also, I never heard of a Maje and it is too incredible to even attempt to believe. People who heal the wounded and take their pain? Leyla made me angry at best during the entire story. How, after seeing how her man was treated by the different people, did she insist their lives be spared! Please! Jarrett has got to be the bigger fool to allow her to sway him. This was too much for me. I like stories that are believable. This was ridiculous. Even the ending didn't make it all worth reading."
4,"Great book, but...","The book has great pictures and shows that other cultures have flood stories. However, the book is small in terms of amount of content."
1,LaCrosse weather station,"This weather station is a big disappointment. I've tried it wired and wirelessly with the same problem. Over a 12 hour period the maximum wind speed and rain accumulation creep up regardless of actual conditions. The wind usually topped out at 87 mph and the rain at 34 inches. Actual conditions were no rain and maximum 10 mph wind. LaCrosse says there is no problem with the equipment, there must be interference in my neighborhood. But other less expensive LaCrosse products have worked here so I doubt it. This station was reduced from almost $300 to $100 but since it isn't worth 2 cents that isn't a bargain."
1,junk,This is my second unit and they just don't work. The outdoor transimitter doesn't have enough power to send the signal more that about 3 feet. The indoor thermometer works fine.
5,Excellent product overall.,"I have owned one of these weather stations for a couple of years now, and have been extremely happy with it. Since everybody who sees it at my house comments favorably on it, I decided to start buying these for Christmas presents since they are so affordable. Everyone seems to love their gift. They work perfectly, and the battery life is great. I have a couple of the wireless transmitters sending the temperature signals to this device, and the range and accuracy is very good."
2,Whiny ... A Disappointment,"After hearing ""I Wish I Was A Punk Rocker With Flowers In My Hair,"" I was really looking forward to hearing the rest of Sandi Thom's repertoire. Unfortunately, the album is filled with whiny songs and marginal-at-best vocal performance. I tried hard to like it, but... it just isn't very good."
4,Smile...It Confuses People. It really does.,"A pretty nice pop debut album from the Scottish Sandi Thom. Wasn't really familiar with her til I was looking through a KT Tunstall playlist and a related search popped up titled ""Sandi Thom"" so one click away began my journey of buying this (for a penny, a cheap bargain) and listening to the whole album. I'd have to admit, though, that constant listening to this will drive you a little off the wall (maybe due to the whining...) but there are some gems in here: ""When Horsepower Meant What it Said"", very beat-driven, ""I Wish I Was A Punk Rocker"", cleverly written & catchy, ""Lonely Girl"", a slow story-ballad, ""Time"". Those are my favorites, anyway. Give her a try."
2,Not So Exciting,"Apparantly I live under a rock because this album and singer who I had never ever even heard of has made a fairly big splash in the UK. First let me say I bought this at Tower for like $2 and only bought it cause 1. It's cheap 2. The Album cover boasted ""The UK #1 album including the UK #1 single ""I Wish I Was A Punk Rocker (With Flowers In My Hair) and 3. Umm did you just read the title of that single? So I bought it and listened to it and was only a tad impressed.This Sandi is a good enough singer but the single is nothing like I expected and had she written just a tad bit more clever lyrics perhaps that song could've saved the album for me. Instead it's almost the worst song on the album.She does a lot better on more poppy ballad type of things like ""Lonely Girl"" and ""Sunset Borderline."" After listening to the whole album, it occured to me that upon repeat listenings I learn to like it a bit more but right now it's just doing it for me."
4,Retro Rock,"For those of you who have read the first series of comments, don't believe them. Sandi is a breath of fresh air.I Wish I Was A Punk Rocker With Flowers In My Hair will have you humming that song for a long time. It isdifferent, fresh, evocative and a flashback to the 60's. In fact if you are tired of the same old same old,take a listen to what Sandi has to say and how she says it. Both the lyrics and melody grab you. It is so refreshinghearing something different. I applaud Sandi on her commitmet to be different. Buy the CD. You will love it.The other comments are not listening to what she has to say. The production is simple, the style is retro, andthe voice is haunting. Buy the CD. One note, the CD is very short, 33 minutes. I ended up purchasing her twomini CDs and adding it all on one CD to make a great assortment of music."
1,Battery did not work. Only one charge and stopped working,Received this battery and never worked correctly. Only charged completely one time and stopped working. Never kept the charge on. What a waste of money. Never buy from them again!!!
1,Poor,We charged it once and it worked great. Charged it again and it didn't work after that. This is a horrible product.
2,Battery,"Battery was purchased as a replacement for a Fisher Price Barbie Mustang, we have charged and used the new battery only twice and the battery had already run down and we had to ""hand tow"" the vehicle home about a half a mile in our neighborhood, as the battery died, wish Fisher Price would improve the life of this product and rechargeable quality. This product is expensive for the life of the battery. We followed instructions of not allowing the battery to ""die"", we recharge after use, but still the battery life is not long enough for a child to drive the vehicle around the neighborhood, very disappointed."
4,Works well,"Got the white battery with grey top. Has been working as expected. The 3 yr old boy has been riding the powerwheel car with a fully charged battery for about 1 hr after a full charge. As indicated, we fully charge the battery after every other 1 hr ride and it delivers all the power to leave the boy happy for an hr."
1,"Crap, Crap, CRAP","I read the reviews about the battery dying and thought that perhaps things had changed. Apparently not. I bought the battery on 4-11 and got less than 10 charges out of it before it croaked. Amazon was nice enough to credit my card, however I won't be purchasing another battery from Amazon. I am hoping to get one from Fisher-Price that is better?? *crossing fingers*"
1,Rechargeable battery,I am sure this battery is not NEW it has only held a charge one time!! This battery is junk do not buy!!
1,Terrible product,"The first battery we had for the Power Wheels was fantastic, it lasted for almost a year. BUT this one didn't last for one day and now, even after a full charge, it will only power the ride for less than 10'. Can I return it? Can I afford the shipping charge in order to return it? Fisher-Price should be a better company than this."
2,Weak,"We charged per the instructions, and we got about 3 runs of this battery. Now we charge it, and it lasts a few minutes. And we cannot return it because it is a hazardous material. Very frustrated."
2,not,we bought this for the power wheels fire truck but it doesnt really work that great. expensive for a battery.
2,"Battery seems to work, seller terrible packaging","I did receive the item very quickly and it seems to work. HOWEVER, I have no idea if this item is brand new as there is NO PACKAGING included. Literally the only thing you receive in the (very thinly lined) bubble wrapped package is the battery. Extremely poor shipping materials used (a priority mail envelope!). I was expecting it to come in the original packaging and it did not. That said, the battery seems to be okay for now but I am quite positive that being banged up and thrown around, like all packages are, across the country was not good. I would not recommend this seller."
4,Great battery for the price!,"I bought this battery about 1 month ago and I am very pleased with it. My son is still a little small for the powerwheels truck, but he has rode in it about 8 hours over the last month. We have not charged it yet!! This battery seems to hold its power very well."
3,Good Battery,Put this battery in grandson's Jeep after charging it the recommended time and it worked great. Holds a charge ferry well and runs the Jeep a long time.
1,power wheel 12 volt battery,Very happy with the fast delivery of the battery and the price of the battery! My grandboys love there power wheel and the battery is great! you made there day! Thank You!
5,it worked,worked like a champ! no issues got this last summer and the car is still working... the charger is sold seperately and I got that from amazon as well.
4,Power Wheels 12 - Volt Rechargeable Battery,"We have had a power 4 wheeler for 10 years. We have had to replace the rechargeable 12 - volt rechargeable battery several times. We have always been able to buy the battery local, but this time we could not find the battery at any store. After looking on Amazon.com we were able to find it with no problem. Even with having to pay shipping, it was still cheaper than what the retail local price was. Received the battery within a week and the grand kids are up and running the 4 wheeler again. Thanks Amazon!"
1,Battery did not work upon arrival,"Upon receiving this battery we charged per the manufacturers recommendation and it will not hold a charge. Amazon, of course, took care of me but the product is garbage."
1,fun for a couple of days,"This battery was great for about two charge cycles...I charged it 18 hours the first time like the instructions said to do. Jeep ran great for about the expected two hours or so...Charged it again that night for 14 hours...ran great again...The third day, I charged it for 14 hours again and hooked it up to the jeep and NOTHING ...I followed all of the instructions to a T. What a piece of JUNK. Power Wheels should be ashamed of themselves for selling such an awful product and doing nothing about it."
4,This battery works just fine after all,"I felt pretty stupid when, after reading several bad reviews here, I bought this battery anyway and it only ran for 5 minutes after recharging it the first time. My husband tested the charger to ensure it was functioning properly and then took the battery to a local battery specialty store for testing, which confirmed the battery was perfectly fine. Then upon returning home he discovered the switch on the power bar on the back of his workbench had been accidently flipped to the off position. Our original and back up batteries have both been recharging and functioning perfectly ever since.I'm posting this review as a reminder to other people to check every possibility, including having the battery tested, before assuming their battery is bad."
1,Battery didn't take a second charge. No Return Option,I purchased two of these 12 volt batteries for two different ride on toys and one of the batteries failed to take a charge and work after the first use. ($50+ down the drain). You are taking a little bit of a gamble buying online but it's almost 50% cheaper than retail stores. Please note that Amazon will not accept batteries as a return and some of the companies that sell their products on Amazon require return processing within 15 days. My advice is to charge your battery properly and use it as soon as you get it so that you can take action quickly if the battery does not work.
4,Battery is great!,"We have had a power wheels jeep for about 5 years, my grandson comes over and rides it around on our yard for hours, the battery doesn't go dead. Now he's too big and his little sister is driving it ON THE ORIGINAL BATTERY! It sits in our garage over the winter in sub freezing weather, hardly ever gets charged. In spring we plug it in for overnight and off she goes again for very long rides. I have to say this is the original battery and not the replacement but the picture sure looks exactly like the one in there!? So why is ours so good?!Unknown!Good luck!"
5,Super Charger!,Bought this for a ten year old Power Wheels riding toy that was given to us. It holds it's charge well. Very powerful. Easy to use.
1,Amazon recommendation - Wrong type of battery,"The ammazon cross sell recommend i purchase this batter with the 12V Black Mercedes Benz G-Class Battery Operated Ride-on Toy Car, BEWARE this is not to correct type of batter for that Vehicle. I wasted$60+! Apparently you can not return BATTERIES!"
1,Don't recommend.,"This battery worked for the first month and then when we recharged it, the battery lasted for less than 10 mins. I think we need a charger cable that shuts off when the battery if charged. This is my 3rd power wheels battery that went bad in less than 6 months."
4,Perfect replacement battery!,"Battery was bought as a replacement of the old battery for my sons Power Wheels 4-Wheeler. Old battery was slow, constantly needed recharging. This works great! He has found a new love of his 4-wheeler again. We were going to purchase a new Power Wheels altogether thinking he was bored with his and once the new battery came in and the 4-wheeler was running full speed again he has been riding it all the time again! Perfect replacement battery if your is old, running slow, needing constant charging!"
5,Battery works great,"I got this battery to replace an old worn out battey for my granddaughter little red corvette.. It works great and last a good long time... I do think it's a little pricey, but all batteries are that way."
1,Big waste of money,Thios battery is a POS. After only two uses it doesn't hold a charge anymore. What a waste of money. I'm getting my daughter a gas powered atv instead.
1,This battery is terrible!!,"I should of listened to the other reviews. Please avoid this battery at all cost. It lasted my kids for about four hours. The battery was charge according to manufacturers instructions and Still didn't work. If your looking at buying a battery for your power wheels product, I would first dump Fisher Price and go with a regular rechargeable 12 volt battery. No sense in contacting this company, do to their size they probably don't care about customer satisfaction."
1,I have bought four....never again!!,"I have bought four of these batteries. I feel like a fool after reading so many bad reviews. Please look for an alternative. Out of the four batteries I have not gotten 20 hours of use. It is sad that a company as Fisher Price would sell such a mediocre product. The ride on is nice, please look for an alternative on replacing the batteries."
3,Be Careful On Over Charging This Battery,I purchased this battery in 2004 for my sons Kawasaiki power wheel. The charge is not holding any longer. This started happening a couple of months ago. I believe I inadvertently over charged the battery. Either I over charged it and/ or the battery only last a couple of years.
1,JUNK!!!,This replacement battery worked for one use. I charged it as the instructions directed and it has not held a charge since the first use! I am disgusted that I now have to attempt to get a new one and return the 'new' one I just bought my daughter for her birthday!
1,BATTERY DOESNT WORK!,"The battery was received within 5 days. Charged the battery as instructed. Inserted the battery into our Fisher Price toy.....let me say should of listen to other reviews. Battery worked for an hour max and would not charged!! Going to our local Toysrus to purchase the battery since I can return it to the store. Also, i noticed the battery that was sent to my had an expiratin date of 1/2013. !!!"
1,50/50 shot,"After reviewing some of the other reviews, we figured we would try the battery even though some stated it lost a charge very quickly. We too did all the correct things to charge it and it went dead after a couple of runs in the jeep. Very disappointed."
4,works great!,"This is pretty cut and dry. It worked like a new battery of its type should. Plugged it right up into the car, let it charge for the recommended time and it ran like a champ and still does."
1,DO NOT BUY,Check the reviews they are all correct when they say that this battery will not recharge it works only 1 time after that it works at about 10 percent only last for about 10 15 minutes tops... it's a shame that they are able to screw all these people over who have bought this battery and had the same problem that I did I actually put it on a timer to make sure I did not over charge the battery.. I should have listened to all the bad reviews on this battery
3,Jeep Battery,"The battery powers the jeep well, arrived on time and intact. Overall very pleased with it's performance. Battery matches original equipment exactly."
5,Good Battery.,"The first one I recieved was busted, I got online and talked to a Amazon rep. live; they sent me another one over nite at no cost. I just throw the busted one away. The second one came with much better packaging. Thanks Amazon!!"
3,So Far So Good,"We read the reviews on the F-Price rechargeable batteries and was not greatly encouraged that they would work satisfactorily, but our new battery replacement has worked well so far. I did charge it according to the directions. This toy (a Power Wheel) is not played with everyday but it has held it's initial charge one month later."
1,"bad, bad. bad","There is absolutely nothing to redeem this film. The acting, direction and cinemaphotography are all poor. Save your money and time Worst movie I purchased this year"
5,Great comics!,"If you know HM already, you know that it's not like other comic magazines. It has no fixed characters, artists, or story lines. Instead, each issue is a collection of illustrated stories, portfolios, and reviews of varied material.That said, some artists (Suydam, Corbin, and lots of others) have been regulars here for decades. And yes, some stories do last from issue to issue. And yes, HM does have a consistent look to it: adventure/fantasy/SF, with a post-PG13 emphasis on fully inflated female figures. It's ideal for 14-year-old boys with inflamed if uninformed imaginations. It's not ""adult"" by any means, but advertises lots of videos, books, and magazines that are.If you're serious about comics, you must pay attention to HM. I'm not saying you have to pay attention very often or even like it - my own feelings are mixed. Still, the artwork is consistently good and you're likely to see the artists again elsewhere.//wiredweird"
2,Thin and crispy?,I have used an old pizzele iron from my deceased mother-in-law for over 25 years. The element finally gave out. Looking for an iron that makes thin and crispy pizzeles.Does this model make them thin?
2,Should I buy this pizzelle iron?,I have used a Pizzelle Maid model #400 for many years. Does this pizzelle iron make the pizzelle's thin and crispy?
5,Par excellence: Insights on Southern Africa,"Mostert's history of South Africa was one of those rare sorts of reads that wherever you begin to try to describe it all you can come up with are superlatives that verge on exaggeration. Never before had I recognized the parallels of historical events in which eighteenth and nineteenth century European colonialists---in Africa and America---with self-professed Christian values, put to the test their noble beliefs. Such moral rectitude was in no way translated in the way each dealt with their native populations. Mostert exhaustive analysis provides an important chronicle on the effects of European colonialisn in dismantling a once proud Xhosa nation."
4,synopsis,"Journalist Osmar White's gripping story of the Australian and American forces' struggle against the Japanese invasion of New Guinea in 1942-43 is stark, vivid, chilling.White is true to his sources - four 'dog-eared notebooks' and his original newspaper dispatches - but it is his sharp recollection of the terrible battles and the courage and endurance of his friends, etched forever on his memory, that makes Green Armour truly unforgettable."
3,great,"The Green Bay Packers 20025 blimp is excellent and of great construction, however the stand was cheap looking which was rather disappointing."
5,"Precision baby, precision!","This is what a clock should be like: set it and forget it. You need to know that there is a reference at home, one clock that tells the exact time, all the time."
4,La Crosse Atomic Clock,"This is a wonderful clock. You put in the battery, press your time zone and the clock sets itself. Be patient if the time doesn't set immediately. It sometimes takes a couple hours for the clock to find the proper signal to set. Once it starts working it keeps perfect time. When daylight savings time rolls around it automatically sets itself to the proper time. The clock also is a perfect size and look for the area I needed one. It says kitchen, but it looks great in my office."
1,Junk Lacrosse clocks,"Purchased 2 La Crosse Technology WT-3122J 12-1/2-Inch Atomic Analog Clock, Natural Wood. Returned one that was defective because it kept running around all the time. The hands would not stop. Have used the second one for about 5 months and the same thing happened. I returned the first clock and Amazon took care of my refund. The second one was past the return date and was not worth the postage to send it back for repair. Junk, Junk, Junk. Don't buy this clock. This is my opinion of this product. I am not an engineer but this clock shouldn't be on the market."
1,Non- functional right out of the box!,"The idea of a self setting clock is great, the quality of the movement is junk. The clock did not work right out of the box. Followed the instructions about setting up the clock and inserted batteries. The new clock would not set, it just keept running the minute hand at warp speed around the dial. Let it run that way for 72 hours, no change. Returned it to the seller for a full refund (minus the shipping charges both ways.) Had to call the seller twice, first time to get a RMA and a second time to get refund. Seller was very nice, helpful and all that. Let is slip that they get a lot of returns!La Crosse Technology WT-3122J Radio-Controlled Analog Wall Clock, Wood"
1,Really Not Worth The Money,"Hello,I bought this just over a week ago, I really like the design of the clock is is very nice looking but that is where it all stops. I set it to my time zone ( Eastern ) as in the directions and about an hour later it started to track the radio signal, great. A few days went by and out of the blue it set itself to pacific time and the second hand stopped moving completely, I tried to reset the clock and pushed the Eastern Time Zone button again, it did synchronize again but the second hand stays on 12...oh well... It is working again without the second hand and i do like the look of it lets hope and pray it stays set for more than a few days."
1,"Wow, this so didn't work","I spent three days plus the next weekend moving this clock to different parts of my house: upstairs, front, back, in a window -- nothing. It never ever got a full/workable signal. I changed out batteries, positioned it horizontally, vertically facing west/east -- nothing. I had a previous atomic clock that worked for years till it died, so I'm thinking my house/reception (I'm in New Jersey) ought to be fine. Its this clock that clunks."
3,Great looking clock,"This clock looks just like expected, but we never got it to find the ""signal"" to set itself. We set it in a window facing west , but it never set. We manually set it and it worked for 2 weeks,then stopped at 6 pm. We manually set it again and moved it to another location - it may have been too close to the tv (directions say it must be 6 feet away from electrical equipment) Still trying, but hoped it would work better !"
2,La Crosse radio wall clock,"Received one as a gift around 12/2005. Worked reasonably well in New England for several months. Would occasionally forget its time and resync. Seemed to eat batteries. After 6 months or so it would not sync reliably. After multiple resets and battery changes, gave up and sent it back for repair but they returned it saying it worked fine for them. I would guess that it might work better if closer to Colorado and the radio signal source, but I've given up on it in New England. Nice looking clock and I was happy with it when it was working."
3,Atomic clock WT-3122J,"Received the clock within the specified shipping time. Very easy to set with clear directions. As stated, clock set to correct time zone over night.Six months later (June 2010). The second hand stopped! Clock hour and minute hands still functioning as advertised. No movement on the second hand. Requested assistance from manufacturer."
2,"Looks OK, But Doesn't Set Itself","Although it says it resets itself every night, it failed to reset when it came time to go off of daylight savings time, and had to be done manually. Another atomic type clock further down on the same wall in the same room had no problem getting a time signal and resetting itself. I would say that the receiver chip in the clock of of poor quality. It does look good and keeps good time so twice a year resetting isn't worth the expense of sending it back. However would NOT purchase another one."
3,They Need More radio towers,It's good technology but very inconvenient and doesn't work all the time. I don't like how it has to be by the window all the time and how there is certain criteria for the clock to work like how it has to be away from things that might interfere with the radio signal (which is about everyting nowadays). They need to build more radio towers or even go satelite for me to even consider buying another of their product. The clock simply doesn't work if you don't live in Colorado where the radio towers are.
4,Nice Clock,"This clock is attractive and easy to read from across a large room. It took a little patience for it to find the signal to synchronize, but waiting about 1 1/2 days was all it took. It set itself just fine inside a metal building about 20 ft from the nearest window.I also noticed several reviews talking about the clock being 20 minutes slow. In case you have that problem, check the battery. All of my LaCrosse clocks use that as a way to tell you the battery is about to die."
3,A Good Try,"This book does a decent job at describing the aerodynamics and hydrodynamics of a keelboat. Admittedly, it's a tough topic to teach from a book. The difference between books on sail trim and theory really comes down to the graphics used to help in explanation. This is where this book falls short. Having said that, though, a new sailor will learn and benefit from reading Hahne's book."
1,Not for the racer (or the knowledgeable),"You would think a book entitled ""Sail Trim"" might actually have more than a few pages on that topic.Instead, you get 20 pages on poorly simplified and misrepresented fluid dynamics (granted, I was an Aerospace Engineer in college), 30 pages on different kinds of boats, 15 pages about a ""new"" automated sail trim on some crazy German boat, and 2 pages that - with no real explanation - dictate rig tuning and sail trim for a variety of conditions.I was expecting the ""Theory"" to inform the ""Practice"" and hoping to learn something I didn't know about the complex interactions of multiple sails on large yachts and the way to use dozens of different controls to maximize boat speed. But there was none of that. This purchase was a huge failure of Amazon's ""Look Inside"" feature.Do NOT buy this book unless you are a casual cruiser and an armchair physicist - if you take either discipline at all seriously, you will be sadly disappointed."
5,This book is hot!,"Our wandering hero confronts her first demon in Inferno, and Cooper does not disappoint. From beginning to end, this story moves, and is populated by interesting characters.Nemesis, Book 1, was a kind of promise to the reader to deliver seven sequels of harrowing tales of good vs. evil. This is the first delivery, and Cooper nails it."
5,Winsome Wood Phone Stand-Maple - Very nice product,"Very nice looking. Product arrived in good condition and as represented in the Amazon listing. Using as a corner table. Has shelves to hold collectables. Easy to put together. Does has slight inperfection in the ""wood"" on the bottom of one side but only adds to character. Worth the money at the sale price."
5,Beautiful shoe!,"Wow...I can't believe how beautiful these shoes are! Very nicely made and comfortable from the word ""GO""! Certainly a must have!"
4,Very Erotic,Deeper than Desire by Cheryl Holt was a historical romance with multiple love stories. It had a mix of evil and pure love. Not for the weak of heart - but overall very well written.
3,JUST OK,"Definitely not as good as her previous books (which I loved!). There are too many stories going on at the same time and you don't get to really connect with the ""main characters."""
1,Really bad romance novel,Wow. What can I say? I have read half of the book and don't want to finish it. The characters are pathetic and boring. How did this get published. I had already bought the book before I read the reviews or I wouldn't have. Use this book to start your bonfires.
2,Um...,"I think this could have been a good story. The plot was definitely doable. But the problem was that there were too many characters. And some of them were...well, a bit dumb. Not stupid, just a tad dumb. A lot could have been done with the two main characters and the storyline, but it was ruined by all these other characters who were impossible to relate to."
1,"""Stressful"" ""Confusion"" ""Too Rushed""","This was a very stressful story. Why in the world did he have so many characters and different plots going on. I have never read anything like this in my life. It simply made no sense. There were so many characters in the book, that I forgot who the main characters where. When I read the back of the book I though the main characters would be Olivia and Phillip. However, there was so many couples and so much mess and confusion I actually forgot who the main characters were. I don't know how I got through to the end. The main characters should have been Edward and Winnie. All I have to say is don't waste your time and money on this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,P.E. should have made Spike Lee's film!,"In true P.E. fashion, we get the state of the black nation, this time specific to basketball stardom. This album's lyrics rubs the new, corporate slavery of young, black athletes in our faces. The listener gets in touch with what blood-sucking greed, money, and politics smells like.While the soundtrack is decidely more three dimensional, the film itself is less profound. Perhaps, as a consequence of the movie's subdued flavor, the actual music doesn't pack as much punch into every song as it should. It's true, the song *He Got Game* is the least powerful song on the album.Nonetheless, the total shot works."
