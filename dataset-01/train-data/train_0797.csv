1,One of THE worst films ever... PERIOD!,"Have you ever watched a movie where the acting and plot is so cheese that you have to laugh out loud in the theatre in the middle of a serious scene... because it just can't get any dumber??? Well this is one of those kinds of movies, except when you're not laughing, you are snoring. But I might add, there is suspense... you will be asking yourself ""When will this senseless movie ever end?""Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro fight in the woods camouflaged with their little man-made knives... making ooga-booga grunting noises as they swing away for 10 minutes. Then they disappear again in the woods for a while to construct another lame knife and do the ooga-booga all-over-again.If you want to laugh at one of the stupidest movies ever made... rent this movie, but by no means buy it. For those of you with a high-school education and above, I strongly recommend against this movie.... strongly! And oh yeah, don't be fooled, the one star rating is a negative star!"
5,"great, great movie","This movie was sweet. It had great and realistic action sequences.This movie was a lot like First Blood with a little bit a the fugitive in there, but those movies make a great combination together. The knife fighting was spectacular, especially the last fight scene. Overall this movie was great, it was very enjoyable."
4,Popcorn thriller,"Good movie. Not a great movie. Tommy Lee Jones plays a good mentor/teacher. Beautiful scenery and location. Fights scenes are graphic, definitly not a movie for children. Jones and Benico do alot of their own stunts."
3,HOW COME?,"I'm not sure exactly what this movie was supposed to say? Benicio del Toro (in an utterly bland performance) plays a trained killer who decides to kill two forest rangers and two hunters, telling himself that they were out to get him? Even with an effectively disturbing opening in Kosovo, the movie ends up being a chase scene wherein Tommy Lee Jones (as always, effective) uses his tracking skills to track down Del Toro, lose him, track him again, lose him, etc.Director William Friedkin (French Connection) paces it well and it has some good action scenes, but ultimately it gets repetitive and rather dull as we all know how it will end up.Connie Nielsen (Basic) suffers through her rather needless role, and Leslie Stefanson as Del Toro's love interest provides some human spark to an otherwise heartless film.Good action, but not involving enough to be great."
3,Good for the first 30min.,"This movie had potential a Goverment assassin(Del toro) gone astray,and his former ""killing"" trainer(Jones) out to hunt him down.This is all great but sometimes its almost funny you have an assasin at the top of his game being hunted by his trainer who has to be twice his age.oh! and (Jones) takes no weapons at all to hunt this man in the woods,thats realistic.But it does get three stars for the actors and for the first 20-30 min.RENT ONLY!"
4,Hunted or Hunter?,"Bonham, Tommy Lee Jones, plays a survivalist that is retired from training military/CIA people to survive and kill. He is called out of retiredment in British Columbia by the police when four hunters are killed. As he begins to recognize the killers methods he realizes he trained him and the identity of the killer. When he finally confronts Hallam, Benico Del Toro, and he claims that he is being wrongly hunted by sweepers for the CIA. Jones must decide whether he is telling the truth and how to bring him back to justice. There is some beautiful scenery and a good deal of action in the wilderness and in the city. Well worth a look, especially if you like Tommy Lee Jones."
2,"I liked the blood, but boring!","I thought a whole movie about chasing one guy got old fast. I was bored, and fast forwarding most of it.....its the same thing over and over and over again.....not what I expected"
2,Drive in movie for the noughties-boys and their ugly toys,"A huge amount of talent has gone into a pretty thin chase movie which has none of the panache of say The Fugitive. Undoubtedly, Mr Jones and Mr Del Toro are watchable (and bankable) actors. Because it is R rated - lots of knives and descriptions of how to carve up a man - it's audience I guess is lonely young men who fantasise about violence, or who have a thoroughly unhappy view of humans and relate better to dogs and squirrels than they do to their neighbours. Interesting to see Mr Maltin gave this an above average review whilst considering the director's earlier masterpiece - To Live and Die in LA - an unworthy film."
3,"Great TLJ performance, so so movie","Tommy Lee Jones can make any movie worth watching, even limp ones and this ones is so lame. Actually a waste of his powerhouse talents. Tommy Lee Jones is a trainer of assassins, and he trains Benicio Del Toro (The Usual Suspects) into the perfect killing machine. We have given reasons (VAGUE REASONS) why suddenly Del Toro cannot stomach being a killing machine any longer, so what does he do...goes rogue and kills. There is only one person who can catch him, Tommy Lee Jones, who is ageing.So starts a nice cat and mouse game - but who is the cat and mouse. Nice watch, but will soon fade. Doubt most people would want repeat views of this movie, is do, suggest getting a used copy. Tommy Lee is worth that. His performance is marvellous, just the rest of the film does not match his level."
3,Not Totally Bad.,"Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro are great actors and they don't fall short in this film.Problem is the script is so botched in this crazy caper that its sort of hard to enjoy until the end where it makes up for the times it messed up earlier in the movie.Del Toro plays Aaron Hallam who is haunted by the nightmares of killings in Kosovo and has became a rouge special forces assasin.Jones plays L.T.Bonham who trained Aaron along time ago and now feels as if it is his responsibilty to catch Aaron and put an end to the murders.The film has a pretty good start but eventually begins to drag,making you feel like running to a video store while the movie is still playing,pick up another one and be ready to pop it in by the time the movie ends.The film really isn't extremely bad but does have some problems that should have been worked out before the release of it.But you know,it is worth the four dollars you pay to rent it.C- for the movie,B- for the acting.Enjoy!!!"
3,"C'mon, it's FRIEDKIN!","If you're the type of person who doesn't like character development and plot cluttering up your movies, THE HUNTED is for you. It's cold, bleak, violent, and pretty much all action. Various synopses may lead you to believe it has a plot, and the film actually starts to build up to one, but essentially eschews it all in favor of Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio del Toro beating each other up for 90 minutes. The good thing is that this is a William Friedkin action film, so you know it's going to be graphic, gory, and very pulpy, with a good (although short-lived) car chase, and slightly arty direction. Honestly, though, I was very impressed how there was no music blaring away as Jones and del Toro stabbed the hell out of each other. Say what you will, I'm a big Friedkin fan, and I enjoyed this one."
2,"Two great actors, one terrible film","This movie is contrived and implausible, and I don't know how it can be billed as a thriller with its total lack of suspense. Why these fine actors chose to act in such a film, I'll never know, but I don't know how either of them kept from rolling their eyes when both of them, during a police chase, found time to forge and create their own knives. Give me a break. The tiny side plots about Del Toro's love life and Jones' work for the wildlife service are there, I suppose, to make their characters seem more interesting. The only thing I can imagine making them more interesting is their refusing these roles.I'm so glad I rented this movie before purchasing. Now I only have to lament the loss of four bucks.Skip it."
2,Made for tv surely,"Halfway through this I wondered if in fact I was watching a parody of the Fugitive.How either of these actors agreed to be a part of this over the top, ultra cliched, poorly executed mess is anyone's guess. The plot and scripting don't get much worse although there are a few moments of decent action but you've really seen it all before. Pretty blah editing and direction to boot.Watch out for a re-enactment of Predator in last 10 minutes before an overly bloody and tacky close.One redeeming factor for The Hunted is that it was refreshing to watch a film that ended predictably without resorting to a trendy twist that a lot of films employ these days 'to set them apart'."
2,"Junk...and a bloodbath, too.","This would be a standard Tommy Lee chase picture except for all those scenes the other reviewers describe as ""realistic"". Tommy and Benny apprarently have no muscle, no tendons, no arteries. They just hack and hack and keep on hacking.I like action and maybe I'm getting old but I am so damn tired of seeing over-the-top butchering of arms, legs, torsos. Enough already!As for the story, its entirely cliches, start to finish. To make things even worse, we're supposed to feel sorry for Benny (war vet snaps cliche).What a terrible waste of two fine actors."
2,Too boring for me,"I found this movie to be a cliché through and through. It was predictable and pretty boring. The cat and mouse was just tired and rehashed. Tommy Lee Jones is much older than Del Toro, so while he was believable as a teacher, it was beyond belief that he could hunt him down and fight him as if he was just a young athletic himself.There isn't much dialogue in the film, at least not much that matters much. There aren't any good twists or surprises. There are other cat and mouse movies, Cliffhanger and Shoot to Kill, two examples that are set in the woods, that are much more exciting and offer more plot twists and more developed characters.Not much of a recommendation here. Certainly one to rent if you need to see it, I can't imagine seeing this twice."
2,Meh...not bad at the beginning...,"The move starts pretty good, but by 2/3 the way it becomes so unrealistic as to become almost unwatchable. Fights are kind of cool, but don't waste your money here. I'm sure some cable channel has it for free as a late night B movie.Got 2 stars because it started well, and for the action...that's about it."
2,Academy Award winners in violent B flick.....hmmmm???,"Not sure what hollywood was thinking when they cast these 2 fine actor's in a FIRST BLOOD..meets the FUGITIVE flick but oh well.Although it has some interesting action,fight,and Chase sequences that doesnt save this movie.There are far to many FAR FETCHED moments in this movie,one(squirrel track and racoon tracks)in the front yard El Toro pronouces to the little girl of his one time girlfriends in the movie(and remember they are in the suburbs here).Various rediculous falling scenes,over water falls..off bridges etc.And lets not forget the final fight scene wear Jones and Toro slash 20 holes in one another's bodies but still manage not to Pass out or bleed to death from losing pints of blood.So all in all this movie has everthing ridiculous except a flying dragon.So definate thumbs down to two GREAT actors in a very disappointing film."
2,Don't Hunt This Turkey,"Rambo meets The Fugitive and they both lose! Yes we've seen it all before and better. And it isn't laughably bad enough to qualify as camp. It did come close though when the adversaries stop in the middle of a life and death chase to make weapons; Tommy Lee goes native long enough to knap a flint knife as Benicio uses his blacksmithing skills to forge a blade. Jones and Del Toro are wasted in roles that lack development. The biggest question is, if these great talents take on such puny roles what are actors like Stallone and Tom Berenger going to do?"
3,"Not terrible, good action flick","I have been on an action kick lately and I cant get enough of them...came across this little piece of work while at work at the local video store...All other reviews have pretty much nailed this one on the head. Lots of action, but some of the acting is kinda lame. Be prepared to watch lots of blood flow in this one!! With the material that both actors had to work with, I think that this was a good attempt on all accounts!Christopher Berry"
4,A pupil and his teacher,"Jones and Del Toro are at total war. This movie is very violent and a little gorey in parts. The subject is very interesting. Where did they come up with this concept for a movie?The violence fits the story, however, the irony of the beauty of the Northwest and the gore of the movie are totally opposite. This is the story of a teacher who must go after a student who has strayed. Del Toro is absolutely believable. Jone's does a credible job in tracking down his student and in fighting. The constant battle gets to be much. Yet you see Jones using stick-to-itiveness throughout and there are many opportunities for him to give up. He is constantly inventing new things using the surrounding area he is in.This movie takes from Bosnia, to the Northwest US. Del Toro goes from hero to hunted and you wonder who the real prey is."
4,A fun Cat and Mouse thriller,"Don't get me wrong the Hunted isn't a great movie. If the Fugitive wasn't made, I doubt this move would exist. Tommy Lee Jones isn't playing Sam Gerard but it feels like he is. Except the guy he's after in this isn't innocent, he's a brutal cold blooded killer. He trained him to kill and now he went nuts and can't stop killing. Now he's the only person that can stop him. That's the plot student vs teacher. When they aren't having brutal fights, Tommy Lee Jones is tracking him down in the woods, sewers, old gf's houses and down busy streets. It's all fun though and it's nice seeing Tommy Lee Jones chasing a guy that's actually dengerous for once. Benicio Del Toro is scary as the guy he trained and that lost his grip on reality. Despite not playing characters that are developed that great, Lee Jones and Del Toro play them well. Their fight scenes are well done and possibly the most brutal fight scenes seen on film in awhile. They make this film worth watching."
1,Next please!,"My review? Its this: Yesterday I saw this movie. Five minutes after it was over, I wasn't thinking about it. Today, I can barely remember it. I saw the Godfather a week ago. I can take an SAT test on it. Don't listen to any blurbs on the tv ads praising it. They've been paid for.Just read (sigh) Roger Ebert's review. It reads like a grade school paper written during journal time. As if he has contempt for his readers, and the filmmakers who gave him the cash as well. Who's he to thumb his nose? A bad movie. A bad time for making them in general."
1,Interesting ranting or rating?,"I posted a review of one star and the same day, some one counters with an amazing review with almost every word for praising it, amazing! Ranting it 5 stars! This movie is a sad sack of film history.. If any over 21 see's with an I.Q. above 100, please post about this.. I looked at the this posters other reviews, and low and behold I read they rated ""Gods and Generals"" with one star. Stated it was ""Sappy?"" Very interesting...A non Hooey Weird made movie gets one star..Ah, huh.. Question stands, if I mailed this movie to the studio that made could I get my money back? Do pig fly? The people who ranted this movie 5 stars I know you love this movie dearly so.. Hey, $10 dollars and you can have my copy.. Cheers..."
4,del toro is sexy sexy sexy,"benicio del toro is great actor as usual, and the last fight sequence was a perfect ending to this great movie. a must-see movie if you're a fan of del toro, or just action movies."
5,Better than Rambo !,"This movie kicked ... . Tracking, survival, special operations and subsequent changes in personality, are all real things. This movie teaches us alot if we pay close enough attention to it. Action packed and pieced together well. Actors were very realistic and trained well for all the scenes. Do yourselves a favor and see it...... live it."
1,"A boring waste of time, pointless","This was a horrible movie. There was absolutely no point at all to it except to watch two guys cutting each other up with knives. The beginning started off great and I thought it might have potential to turn into the standard good guy gets messed over by the government but his trainer decides to buck the system and helps him out, not the case. I was really disappointed and almost fell asleep several times. Very tedious and boring. If you want excitment dont watch this movie but if your a sadist and you want to see two grown men cut each other up with knives then I would recommend it."
4,"WILLIAM FRIEDKIN, OPUS 17","**** 2003. Directed by William Friedkin. Four years beforeBug (Special Edition), his last film to date, Friedkin, in THE HUNTED, already took an interest in the case of a soldier suffering from a mental disorder. But when one knows that it was his teacher/father who had the duty to stop him, the movie acquires a very interesting dimension. Recommended."
4,Brings back grandma!,"Finally I can bake like Grandma! My maternal grandmother was born just out of Prague after the turn of the century and while my mother and aunt are good cooks in their own right they never learned how to make the pastries that Grandma made - most of them filled with prunes or poppy seeds. In this excellent and well written book the author has filled the gap for us who want to get back to those Eastern European roots. As I mention, the book is well written and I like the asides that explain the culture that goes along with the cooking. I wish there were more pictures - there never seems to be enough pictures in cook books - but it's a top rate effort."
5,kaffeehaus,"I love this book, thanks to Rick Roger.Last year ,I have a chance to travel to five cities that include Paris,Vienna, Budapest,Prague, and Brussel. My mom and I both have a sweeth tooth, so we visited all the famous pastry house in france like Fouchon, Lauduree,and all local pastry shop, In Austria, We visited the Hotel Sacher, Demel, Aida,and Sluka .aswell as other local Konditorei ( pastry and coffee shop )In Budapest ,wevisted the famous Gerbeaud and Grundel, and some cake at the central market. Unfortunatly we only stay one day in Prague ,So we only try some roll that is coated with peanut crust on the outside,but we did brought lots of chocolate back from Belgium.now when we get back to the U S .I laminated all the receipts from all those store and make those as a bookmark. and guess what book I Put those bookmarks in ."
5,I know I would love it!,"I would love this book, IF I COULD AFFORD IT....have no idea why it is so expensive, if it ever comes down to $25 to $30, I will buy it. Just reading some of the reviews and the names of the recipes that are included makes me long for those wonderful flavors I remember..."
3,"Not Happy, Sorry","I have come to the conclusion that any cookbook in which the recipes origin are from any food service or in this case a Kaffeehaus I will not buy it. No food service business would ever freely give old, traditional or family recipes away. As a pastry chef we change the recipe so that the customers think that they are getting the original one. I thought that maybe since the book was based on the kauffeehauses in Vienna, so far away, that there could be a chance of some good recipes. Some did work but far to many did not, usually the ones with expensive ingredients. The regular home baker may not know how to spot a bad recipe and some you can not. so ""Beware"" before you buy it."
3,Kaffehaus by Rick Rodgers,"Kaffeehaus is a small sized book with a somewhat cramped font. At close to [money] bucks, this little book is overpriced.I was hoping to learn how to make Viennese strudels which is a tough dessert to make from scratch. I believe the author could have been much more helpful in explaining this complicated dish by using detailed photographs. There are many pictures in the book but almost half is non food-related which I found disappointing.It's got many cake recipies if you favor made from scratch cakes. This book also contained stories about the recipies which was interesting to read. ** 1/2 stars"
3,"Kaffeehaus: Exquisite Desserts from the Classic Cafés of Vienna, Budapest and Prague","The book is nice, in that the recipes seem very authentic. But I was disappointed that there weren't more pictures. There were a few pictures to add a little interest and color, but not as many as I was expecting."
5,Good Album to Have in Your Collection,I have been searching for this for years on cd format. I originally had the album. Her version of Higher Ground is very moving. The rest of the cd is filled with inspiring offerings to God! Definitely worth having!
1,Where's The Action ?,"I Bought This Movie On DVD And Now I Wish I Didn't . First Of All Where's The Action And Adventure ? The Movie Is More About Arnold Searching For The Terrorist Who Killed His Wife And Child Than About Him Getting Revenge On The People Who Did It. I Expected To See Arnold Shooting It Up And Kicking Butt . Instead I Got Borring Dragged Out Scene's Of Him Going To South America , Getting Lost , Kidnaped And Then Ecscapeing Before He Finally Get's Back To The United States And Tracks Down The People Who Did It . The Only Action You Get Is In The Last 30 Seconds Of The Movie , When Arnold Kills The Terrorist's . Why Would You Pay 19.95 $ To See 30 Seconds Of Action ?? Forget It ! Save Your Money And Stay Away From This Borring Put Me To Sleep Movie !"
2,No blazin guns,"Arnold doesnt blaze a single gun...He just chops people up with axes.If u want a good arnold movie, see Commando, True Lies, T2, Conan, Total Recall, Last Action Hero, Kindergarten Cop, Predator, Running Man, etc..."
1,Yawwwwwn,"We have come to expect ""action films"" to have poor scripts, stories and dialog, but they MUST have good action sequences. The action scenes here were about as exciting as watching paint dry.Arnie, you can be back when you find a real movie."
2,Arnie to the rescue...AGAIN?!?!?!?,"A terrorist explosion at a city café must be avenged, and they expect us to believe that Arnie is the one to go all the way to Columbia to save America, with the unlikely aid of the bomber's wife. This unusually ambitious but embarrassing action yarn tries to create explosive entertainment using a very serious issue, and a predictable &#65533;plot twist&#65533; and a finale involving an explosion at a Federal building which takes the emergency services a good fifteen minutes to respond to doesn&#65533;t even come close to being worth your time."
1,So close....but so far.,"Well it looks like an interesting idea. The injured hero righting wrongs can also appear as a terrorist from the other viewpoint. The film raises some good questions but fails to explore them fully. The film portays well the ""Genovese"" effect in war and politics. Which means your life is only worth saving if it makes a good soundbite. The Arnie hero gets abandoned all the way along the line until it suits to rescue him. The villian ""the wolf"", turns out to have the same motivation as the hero, revenge for the loss of a murderd child. I think the original script was probably a lot better before the execs got hold of it and made it more digestable. America is not ready to understand ""why"" they are hated internationally. In the name of free trade nations are seeing their cultures overrun and will fight to preserve their way of life, just as America would. But I spose that just ain't Arnie."
4,Great after all this time,"I have to say that there are a lot of people who feel that Arnold is too old to be doing these type of movies. After seeing this one, I have to say they are dead wrong. Arnold does here what he does best and that's be the hero.He delivers a great performance and at the same time he is an action hero. Loved this film and am looking forward to seeing Termintator 3 Rise of the machines when it hits theaters."
4,Not Bad,"Not bad for his 2nd to last film. I'd say this was definately better than Terminator 3, which was somewhat of a letdown. Arnold plays a real guy in this movie who has a real personality, unlike in some of his others. He is also humbled a little more, and by that I mean he gets the crap beat out of him in some scenes, so don't expect a Commando re-hash. I'd say that this also has alot of meaning compared to Arnold's other beat-em up shoot-em up flicks. But, you won't be let down with the action that is also included in this film, it's just more meaningful. I think you'll like this if you like Arnold, but also appreciate intelligence and substance. If you liked True Lies, you'll like this."
4,A fine performance from Schwarzenegger,This is one of my favorite Arnold movies and would put it with T2 or Commando as my favorites. I thought the story was very well written and keeps my attention well from the beginning to the end. My only complaint was the scene with the snake in the middle of the film was quite gross I thought and could have done without it. Otherwise a well rounded movie that should deliver well to most of Schwarzenegger's devoted fans.Peter J. Miller
2,Over-reaching,"I rented Collateral Damage prepared to be entertained. I don't think that anyone has ever claimed the Arnold movies are anything other than mindless entertainment combined with sophisticated pyrotechnics. Which is fine - I can get with that.Unfortunately, Collateral Damage just tries too hard to be better than what it is. I could see the gimmicky plot twists coming from a mile off! Because I knew what was going to happen, it really deflated the ending. That combined with the low-grade special effects, which looked very fake at times, stunk.On the upside, Arnold's performance was fairly on par and entertaining enough. The beginning of the movie was probably the most interesting part, showing his grief and rage at a system that considered his family's life inconsequential in the face of larger politics. Too bad that the movie couldn't sustain that level of interest throughout."
2,This Ain't Action,"In a world of Spiderman, The Matrix and Charlie's Angels, what we don't need is an aging action star wasting millions of dollars making a movie where the main character is running through jungles with an axe on some sort of lame attempt to seek revenge on those who killed his wife and son. Not a complete waste of time, but I hated spending money to see this movie at theaters. I'd have to be out of my mind to buy it. It's an ok effort and surprisingly it's Arnold's acting skills that make it more tolerable than the so called action. If you really wanna see an action movie that will make you go Ooooh and Ahhhh watch Resident Evil or wait for the new Bond movie that comes out later this year, but please don't waste more money on this movie which is barely worth the price of a movie rental at Blockbuster on coupon day."
1,Bad copy!,"This disc had ""freezing"" issues and finally stopped altogether. Unfortunately, I didn't watch it until the 30-day return deadline had expired."
2,Where Is Jamie Lee Curits When You Really Need Her?,"Arnold, if you're listening, you still have the muscle to make movies. What you don't have is the writing. This is a ninety minute Mexican travelogue with a twenty minute action flick attached. This film could have been dynamite. The characters are right, the action is solid and the subplot is chilling. But the long forestory just slows the film down to a snail's pace. This film needs a drastic rewrite. Buy True Lies and let this one wait until it gets recut."
3,Arnie's back,"After watching this movie, I can see and totally understand why it's release was put off for so long.Within the first 15 minutes of the film, there is a terrorist attack and lives are lost. Families are torn apart by tragedy.Gordy Brewer, Arnie's character, is seriously effected by this violent manuever, and must get revenge.I got really angry and was on the verge of tears knowing their are a lot of people out there who have lost loved ones, and Hollywood made this movie. It really didn't do much for me except bring up those awful memories of 9/11, and that was not a good thing.....For an action film, there wasn't a lot of action going on.Don't recommend...."
2,Arnie is Slipping,The action was OK and the story was weak and a bit predictable. The ending was just plain ridiculous...The villians BOTH survived through that fire! Come on now! They both would of died. Disapointing!
4,Excellent Action Thriller,"This movie surprised me. It got held up after the 9/11 tragedy for good reason, and it slipped by me for more than a decade. But now I've seen it I am glad I did. Very tight plot, good acting, and excellent cast. Believable and at times gripping, this movie is worth seeing. I look forward to seeing Arnold in more ordinary, muted roles."
5,Collateral Damage gets the job done.,"- Very decent plot- Realistic environmental settings- Totally unrealistic yet very cool superhero storyline- Very entertaining action- Fairly politically correct, and not just from a US standpoint.- An Arnold shower scene- Some very funny one linersOk, this IS an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie... Many of this movie's detractors seem to expect a Kenneth Brannagh flick for some reason. Get real. Arnold action films are to be taken for what they are: very entertaining, ... action with a touch of humor and so so acting. And that's why we love him!"
3,BETTER THAN TRUE LIES WATCH THIS INSTEAD.,"its not brill or great it is just an tame action fim that has great acting by schwarznegger . He made this good and the actionis not bad you have two great scenes there arnold kills two in great ways you know the bad guys , what it does fault is the terrorist theme its mindless and typical but fun you can enjoy so you know yo cant hate it because its more well made than some other fims . Puts true lies to shame because true lies is bad this is alright . If i was going to rate it it would be 6.9 out of 10 .0 lacks great entertainment but there is a passable fun watch ."
1,received,"Not only was one of the disks damaged, but only ONE of the two disks was delivered, the other missing from the container."
1,Why did I see this??????,"It was late. I should've been sleeping already but here I was stuck in the couch with a cat on my belly switching latenight channels. And suddenly, Arnold, ""you want collateral damage?"" goes about breaking up some guy's office.Probably too bored by the infomercial programming elsewhere I stayed and looked on.I was wondering how atrocious this is going to be. Who were going to be the bad guys? Russians? Mad scientist? Aliens from Mars? Ahhh, Colombians, the drug lords hidden in the jungles making coke for the insatiable American market.Well, Arnold solves the problem and gets the chick in the process. How else?What an unbeliavable waste of time trudging through this Hollywood effect-laden sludge.I'm Rick Friedman, this has been the Awful Truth, bringing you reality like no other. Catch ya later."
2,poor quality,"or eraser, the quality is good and sound good in French.For contrre collateral damage is of poor quality and the soundtrack is Fr Quebecers.I have more discharge of e8.90 euros customs tax which brings the price of blu ray transport and taxes at a price much higher than what it costs."
1,A Failure of a Schwarzenegger Film.,"Schwarzenegger is a L.A. fireman who's wife and son get murdered in a terrorist bombing done by some very fictional Colombian militants. The law fails to successfully apprehend the culprits, prompting Schwarzenegger to go to Colombia and go on a rampage. The pathetic storyline actually has the Governator falling for the lead terrorist's (Cliff Curtis, who's talent is wasted) wife. Poorly made stupid film and easily one of Schwarzenegger's worst. Elias Koteas is the FBI Agent assigned to the case.1 star."
1,"Please, somebody stop Arnold...","...from making any more action movies! This film was a piece of garbage, lacking a good plot, good acting, good casting, and good storytelling. If you want an Ah-nold movie, go rent Predator or T2. This is, hands-down, the worst movie he's ever done. Including ""Junior""."
1,arnold lost most hair i turned it off sooo bad,wow so bad it hurtsi mean badddddddddddddddddddddarnold looks like he just got outa heart surgerylou ferrigno looks a lot better at this agewow plot really out therefireman goes into junglethen u got the guy from the pest as a bad guy lolfirst dvd ive ever turned off
3,"Better than expected, but not as good as it needs to be","Collateral Damage threatens to become a good film on several occasions but never quite makes it. Partially it's due to the post 9/11 re-editing that played down the innocent civilian casualties in Arnie's quest for vengeance on Colombia terrorists, but more because it seems that the script was probably rewritten a few too many times to accommodate the Austrian Oak. Some swipes at the duplicity and counterproductive nature of American intervention in South America survive as the war hits home, but the film is ultimately content to turn its revolutionaries into cardboard fanatics (not to mention throwing in a ridiculous scene with a snake in case we don't get the point) and go for the big bangs. Still one of its stars better pictures of the last 12 or so years, though.The DVD includes some decent but not everly exciting extras: audio commentary by director Andrew Davis, 6 deleted scenes, a couple of featurettes and the trailer."
3,Just like movie popcorn...,"What was supposed to be ""Arnold's big comeback movie"" is actually an average, run-of-the-mill, action film. It is full of explosions, shootouts and chase scenes so it is not a total waste of time as far as action films go. However, it is not a memorable film at all; the sound and picture quality are really good and there is an interesting plot twist at the end but the rest of the movie is quite brain-dead and even boring in spots.A very average action film. Better luck next time Arnold."
3,Great Arnold Revenge ending!,"I won't bore you with the details. The story is kind of thin and predictable at times, but with enough foreshadowing, you see what's coming. The gratuitous scenes of Arnold getting the crap beaten of him (almost), leading up to the payoff conclusion, is great for those who hate seeing the hero take so long to exact revenge. In the end, the scumbag Columbian terrorist and his wife get their ""just desserts."" Ahhh...revenge is so sweet - Served up by our hero: The Governor of Kah-lee-fornya"
2,Intellectual Damage.,I like seeing Arnold go after those pesky terrorists as much as the next person--but this just makes no sense whatever.Arnold may not be Robert DiNiro but he's better than this. Consider movies like True Lies or even the original Terminator.
1,Some Action - Plot failings galore,"I often wonder who writes 5 star reviews for a movie such as this. Either a die-hard movie fan of the star, or an employee of the studio or movie industry.Out of 5 stars - this is * 1/2 at best.This movie does not compare with Total Recall, Terminator(s) or even the Sixth Day. Predator, Kindergarten Cop (and even Commando) were better movies.The action is contrived, the script is very poor, there is no humor or memorable line(s) which serve to rescue this.Better than Batman and Robin perhaps. Maybe worth a rental. The DVD is average. Save your well earned money on a better movie or take yourself or your kids out somewhere."
3,Watchable,"This is a watchable movie, but nothing special. The cover is deceiving -- it makes it look like yet-another Vietnam movie. Instead, it is more of a mix between a terrorist and a drug-war movie. Too simplistic to say much more."
3,why,"I'm sorry, though i'm a big follower of him.But i don't likethis movie. I don't want prepare recommend this movie to you.I don't want waste your time or money.I wanna cry.Because i already waste my time and money."
5,The Awesumest Movie...EVER!,"This movie is heartwarming. It's basically about Bob Buss, who is a record producer getting Jerry O'Keefe, Mickey Parke, Q.T. McKnight, and Chad and Doug Linus ""2gether"" to form a boy band and prove his former band ""Whoa!"" (who fired him) lip syncs! You will not be able to stop laughing, the guys are all amazing actors, and it is hands down the best movie. Shows a lot of parodies in American culture. I admit I cried a couple times, when Jerry left his girlfriend Erin for the band, but that's okay. This is a great movie, and I think any one and everyone would love it! A must have for any 2gether fan! 2gether 4ever!"
5,2Gether will crack you up!,Don't like boy bands??This is the perfect video to watch. They make fun of boy bands ... and they do it great! Sadly one of the members of 2gether passed away ... Michael Cuccione known as qt mcknight. Any fans of Michael should buy this movie so they will always remember him. This movie is a great buy and I guarentee that you will watch it over and over again.Their music rox too!
4,A Very Good Spoof of America's Boybands,"This was one of MTV's best movies to date, along with Joe's Apartment. MTV basically demonstrates how the typical boy band is put together and then marketed, all the while spoofing several existing and/or now defunct groups with their comic twist. The late Michael Cuccione, who played QT (Cutie) the band member who was dying from a mysterious illness, did ironically die of cancer a short while after MTV began running its TV series 2Gether after the movie of the same name.The humor was great and I never missed an episode of the series. The pilot however, remains the best of the 2Gether genre, and is therefore a must have for every collection."
5,DVD version,This movie is AMAZING. i have a few extra copies of it that i would be willing to sell...my e-mail address is mere6404@yahoo.com if you are want one!and please put 2gether in the title or i will not open your message!Thanks!Meredith
1,PIECE OF JUNK/DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,Low quailty drawers don't fit/pieces missing/garabage/do not waste your money.I boxed mine up and sent it back.
4,I wanted to change my original rating,I orignially rated this company a 1 becasue I misundertstood the process of my return. I did recieve a damaged item and thought I was responsible for returning it and the fee for the return. After rating the Company I sent an email about my situation. I did get a very quick email response and everything is being taken care of on their end. Fed Ex is going to pick up the item and I will not have to pay for the shipping process. Brooklyn Ray explained in detail to me the steps that will be made in the process of the return. Thank you Brooklyn and once again sorry for the original rating! Tammy
3,NOT REAL WOOD,"Just so you know, it says wood construction but it really is wood composite or MDF.It definitely is a whitewash finish but does not have the pinkish tone most whitewash finishes have. I will say that you do see the oakish grain through it and I wasn't sure if I liked that or not.The construction isn't the greatest but if you put it together very tightly it looks good. I don't know if I'd buy the whole furniture set because of the construction but all in all I'm happy with the nightstand. I have it next to my rocker/glider in my daughter's nursery just to put a lamp and place her bottles, etc. on. It looks nice and doesn't stand out much which I like.Also, you should know that the knobs have two screws each and the two holes are already in the drawer fronts so you can't really replace the knobs like I planned to."
4,"Unfortunately, his weakest","Too many weak songs -- Cry to Me, Johnny Was (ruined by synths) and Night Shift. Others are worldclass but poorly produced like on Natty Dread -- Positive Vibration, War. The rest of the album is terrific however."
4,Choice Sounds from Bob Marley,"My first introduction to Bob Marley was from this CD. This CD is an excellent introduction for a Bob Marley newbie, and essential for a more serious fan. Many excellent songs. ""Positive Vibration"" and ""Roots, Rock, Reggae"" got some airplay - great selections. ""Johnny Was"", ""Want More"", ""Night Shift"", and ""Rat Race"" also stand out. I recommend this CD!"
5,Excellent quality,"My first two strapless bras were from H&M. The back and sides itched my skin and left dark scars that exactly matched the placement and width of the silicone trimming. Naturally, I thought I was allergic to silicone. I decided, however, to try another brand, and seeing the positive reviews of this product, bought the nude bra in 34C. So far, no itching or scarring. The bra fits perfectly; it stays in place and is not at all tight or uncomfortable. Very happy with my purchase."
5,"Comfortable, stays secure, true to size","I'm extremely happy with this purchase. I bought my typical size and it fits perfectly. It's exactly the same level of comfort as any other bra, only the straps don't fall down (since there are none). It does come with a set of invisible straps to give you extra options. The fabric is really soft. The color is a perfect flesh tone. The cups are completely smooth. Best strapless I've ever found."
4,good for a strapless bra,I've never worn a strapless bra before but this one feels like it will stay up and do the job.
3,Not enuf lift,"I think it looks good on my wife, but she feels it does not add enuf uplift to her 38 C's."
2,Does not provide support-I might as well not wear anything,"Simply put, it was almost as if I had not worn anything. This did not provide enough support even though it wrapped well around my breast."
1,Inconsistent Sizes - Poor Customer Service,"We bought 5 Maidenform bras on Maidenform's website, and when my wife compared them to each other you could see the majority sent were an inch and a half shorter in length (the 36 was more like a 34), and the cup size was 1 size smaller too so it did not fit. They said over the phone they could do an exchange, then when we paid $10 to ship it to them they said 5 weeks later that they do not do exchanges. They have no consistency in their bra sizes, and they have terrible customer service support.The one bra out of the 5 that she did keep because it ""mostly"" fit she later threw away because it made her breasts look like they were going in opposite directions and the cup size was too small making it pop out in an unattractive way."
2,unsure,"Not too sure if I like this bra.If you are over 60 and have a 38D cup,the support should be greater than a young person whose breasts have not fallen,do not think that this bra could perform this miracle of supporting so much flesh"
5,the silver brumby series,"I've read all of the silver brumby series and they are fantastic it's a shame some kids (unlike me i love books) don't read much books especially this series. Elyne Mitchell makes them so good it makes you feel you are right in there with the charachters thowra, boon boon, golden, baringa and all the others. The books as I said are fantastic and I have the whole series which makes it even better and if you haven't seen the silver brumby movie I say you should go out and see you local video person and see if they have the silver brumby movie."
3,Australian SF Reader,"With all his women dead, the Silver Brumby goes searching for another. He finds one in the child of two horses from another book called Moon Filly. Horse soap opera crossover, if you like.The only question is can he keep her, and keep her safe from another stallion, and the elements, at his advanced age while she foals."
5,There's a movie too!,There's a movie about it too . . . . The Silver Stallion. I loved it. Is the book The Silver Brumby still in print?
5,Clean Jazz,"I love listening to this album. It is great to hear father and son come together to create such a great listening experience. As another reviewer said, the album is very uncluttered and I think that is what I like most about it. It is a clean album that plays some beautifully arranged versions of great songs & standards. The CD flows through the tracks and it doesn't sound like any song is out of place at all. If you're a fan of the Marsalis family, this is a definite buy, but this is an album I think everyone can enjoy."
5,Great CD but...,"This is a great CD, only problem is, the sample names for this CD are not of this CD, it's from another one."
1,For Mormons Only!,"I have really enjoyed and gotten a lot out of Stephen Coveys other books and tapes but this one ""Six events..."" is for Mormons or Latter Day Saints Only. I had to stop listening to it because it just was so ""Mormon oriented"". Very disappointed that I hadn't read enough of the description to pick up on that.Now what do I do with it?"
5,Great Book!,This was just what I was looking for....an inspiring challenge for a year long self improvement project. :)
4,It's cheese-tastic!,"UK Hard House + Hip HopYep, really, that's what this is, and much better than it sounds. They're not particularly polished, but it's got a ton of energy, and I think if they keep producing tracks they could be the next Prodigy for whatever that's worth."
2,Get the free version,"There are 2 kinds of exam prep books: those that encapsulate the theory behind the questions, and those that simply list the questions and answers. This book is of the latter persuasion.If all you want is the question pool, download it for free from the FCC web site.The book contains the quesion pool and answers, with a sentence or two restating each answer without adding information or clarification. It also contains the FCC Rules for part 80, which is also freely downloadable.The only reason I give this book 2 stars instead of 1 is that it sumarizes the equations most commonly used in the questions.I studied electronics in college, and hold the highest ham radio license, but I'm a bit rusty on some of the theory. I was hoping for a review, but this book doesn't even offer a token explanation of the theory behind the questions. It is useless as a desk reference and has no value whatsoever after you pass the exam."
2,Proves the point,"Don't ever buy anything because of a single review. I bought this because someone else said it was great.It is not great.Salt comes out way too fast (which is good, I like a lot of salt) but the pepper just barely trickles out, and your hand will get tired before you get a decent amount of pepper out of this machine (and I like a lot of pepper).Another useless gadget remanded to the bowels of my kitchen cabinets to be tossed out or sold at the next garage sale."
4,Great Carb,Only one complaint I have is it takes roughly 13 min for the electric choke to kick all the way down. Ive had it adjusted several times used to take 20 min. Of course thats in cold weather just put it on problably wont take so long in summer. Plenty of carb for my 1964 Pontiac Catalina with 389 though.
1,throttle shafts worn out,in the automotive business remanufactured means brought back to factory new specifications. this carb had worn out throttle shafts. in fact the area around the throttle shafts and throttle plates still had residue from the air/fuel mixture from its previous installation. amazon was great in allowing me to return this product.
5,Good Source,"I read my friend's copy of this book before ordering my own, I found it to be a great source of info on George Harrison and for rare pictures of the artist."
3,"iron man track is awesome. Others, I'm not fond of.",I love the iron man song. The others are ok. Great for background noise. I still think its a great idea though.
5,academic excellence and well researched,"after many years of studying christianity, i feel that this book is very accurate and well researched. it is in agreement with nearly all aspects of christian academia and basically sums up the evolution of christianity using well documented facts and easy to follow explanations. as a person who has spent a considerable amount of time in the field of christian and islamic study, i must say that the author has summed so many years of my research in this excellent book. i recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning basic facts about the evolution of christianity and how it affected those who came in contact with it. jazakam Allahu khair brother rahim for your dedication."
1,Prophet,"Expected the book to provide some insight into Jesus' influence on Islam, but it seems the book indicates that Jesus is a precursor of Mohammed and Islam; too much propoganda, lack of historical, valid research."
1,"Rubbish, poorly researched, inaccurate, distorted !","As a former muslim leader in Birmingham UK, now a Christian I thought it fair to read this book, but it has untruths and incorrect statements and incorrect quotes on almost every page. No self-respecting person should believe what they read in this book!"
1,It just doesn't work,"I've charged the battery that came with it for hours and it won't even turn the controller on. Try a different one. should be 0 stars, but you have to give 1 I guess."
4,An average movie with moments of brilliance,"The title of my review says it all. I personally bought the DVD because I'm a Jackie Chan/ Sammo Hung fan. Their style of fighting is conducive to the big screen. If they aren't kicking someone's ass with brilliant moves, they are falling on their asses in humorous situations. It's entertaining if you can appreciate slap stick humor. For people like that, I rate this movie a 5, but most people are watching these movies for amazing martial arts, and this movie doesn't really consistently give you that. There are two fights that are really very good, and one that is absolutely amazing. You should buy this movie just to see the fight that comes in the middle of it. I won't explain any further, I'll let you enjoy it for yourself. It's a pleasant suprise at the time that it comes."
4,Old school martial arts at it's finest.,"If you're a Sammo Hung or Yuen Biao fan, this one doesn't disappoint with it's action. The plot may seem a little thin at times, but I watch martial art movies for the action. There's enough good fight scenes to get my thumb's up."
3,"He was a real jerk, wasn't he","I had always been puzzled by the deification of Miles Davis. Yes, he was a good trumpet player and bandleader, but the idolization of him always baffled me. Then again, I cannot figure out why Princess Diana or JFK were deified either.That said, I guess this is an accurate portrayal of a very complex man. It seems to cover all aspects of him and I admire the author for what seems to be copious research.The book shows he was a severe druggie, a man who liked to beat his wives, a man who lacked any empathy whatsoever for the feelings of other people, and a total hypocrite.Some of the people in the book say you have to indulge the artist, that being such a person means he lives outside the normal rules of adult human conduct. I don't buy it."
3,I've read better Miles,"I've read most every book about Miles Davis. So I don't know why I was expecting to learn many new things from this book. Szwed's version seems to be a regurgitation of Miles autobiography, Milestones, and the biography by Ian Carr to name a few. I'd definatley suggest those books before picking this one up. Although I found the book to be well written I didn't think it was the best source to learn about Miles and his music."
4,Great collection of music,Savoy Brown has been making music for years. His talents procede him as I never tire listening to him. Kim Simmons is the greatest. I recommend.
4,Kim Simmonds Can Play the Blues,"I can remember the first time I heard Savoy Brown. A high school friend fired up Tell Mama and I was hooked. But it was not until I heard A Hard Way To Go, Stay While The Night is Young, Street Corner Talking, Hellbound Train, and Wang Dang Doodle that I realized how excellent Savoy Brown was. Those songs still resonate throughout me like great music has a tendency to do. This collection has all the tunes and then some. It is an essential CD for any fan of British blues. And Seth, if you read this, drop me an email. I want to thank you for turning me on to Savoy Brown."
1,"bloated, disoganized, boring","I have to agree that this is quite possibly the worst guide of its kind ever created. Or at least, the worst I have ever experienced. Like trying to learn a language by reading the dictionary."
2,Not so hot,"I am currently using this book at my new job. I was previously exposed to FoxPro 2.6 and then Visual FoxPro, but I never learned to program in it. It is very confusing to the average person who may little to no knowledge of basic programming principles. I see why the ""Dummies"" series is so popular.....definitely not for beginners!"
5,Great book Lots of concepts still applies to Visual FoxPro 8,"I have this book. It's on my desktop on the time. Lots of concepts still applies to Visual FoxPro 8. Every VFP programmer should have it. I doubt Microsoft Press will release a Programmer's Guide for Visual FoxPro 8. Use this book to look up techniques, etc. Not to read cover to cover. You use it once, it pays off."
3,Great gift for the price. My 4 yr old likes it.,"My 4 yr old daughter likes it. I was disappointed because the actuator on it's back does not work. But, my 4 yr old uses her own imagination."
2,I hoped I would like it more than I do...,"This album was listed by The Bass Player Book as one of 30 albums you must own. So I bought it and... well, yes, as the book says, Aston ""Family Man"" Barrett's bass is ""deep, clear, and well-placed in the mix"", and I get why they call him ""the acknowledged father of reggae bass."" But the music otherwise seems dated and repetitve and superficial, and I only like it in small doses. Maybe you have to be stoned..."
5,Great golfing tips,I've watched this DVD before my golf games and have improved my game. I would definitely recommend this product.
4,A good quick reference for many IV drugs!,"I am new to Critical Care and wanted a book to help with the new IV drugs I would see especially. This book is a great addition to a general drug book. I includes more IV information than a general drug book. A few of the dosage recommendations are different than what my facility uses which is a little confusing. But overall, I use this book most days!"
4,TOM THROUGHOUT THE YEARS,"This is a great CD. It has all of his hits throughout his reign as ""The Voice"". The only problem I have is that the record company could have done a little bit better on remastering a few of the older songs for better performance. Other than that it is a great CD if you want an overall view of the man and his music. 4 stars."
2,Try getting best of Tom Jones!,It's way better digitally remastered from the original recording with 22 song tracks. Because this is okay for a collection but polygram reissued a 1998 compiation with more of the man behind his music. Throughout the years with Decca's recording label available from 1997. This not enough for a anthology needs about two other songs to be added by Tom Jones cream of the crops missing selection!

Nemene - Deep Forest/wes Madiko"
3,Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!,"This is yet another Christmas compilation album. It was assembled to benefit the charity Rock For Choice. Most of the performers here could be loosely defined as ""alternative rock"". The best track here is Henry Rollins doing a creepy reading of ""Twas The Night Before Christmas"", which previously appeared on a superior album called A Lump of Coal. Another good one is ""I Did It For the Toys"" by Dance Hall Crashers. ""Christmas Piglet"" by the Presidents of the United States isn't that good, but it's so dumb that it makes me smile. The rest of the songs aren't all that memorable."
2,Buy for one song,"If you can get this CD cheap, buy it for Henry Rollins' take on ""The Night Before Christmas."" The rest isn't worth a second listen."
4,Vargo & SnowPeak Comparison,"I have both the Vargo Chopstix and the SnowPeak ones... here's the rundown:Vargo Chopstix are slightly lighter weight & assemble faster, but aren't as comfortable in your hand & are tipped with a lower-grade, unfinished wood that holds flavors for days.SnowPeak by comparison weigh ~.4oz more and take ~5 extra seconds to assemble, but generally work better as chopsticks. The finished White Ash tips come to a finer point, flavors don't stick, and the wood doesn't splinter. The case is also slightly better quality & has an attached lanyard.Both are still way better than trying to eat noodles with a spork, but all in all, I'd go with the SnowPeak."
5,This book gives me a clearer idea of what I am looking for!,"For years I have been looking to find clarity and illumination in simple truths. I have been searching for simple yet profound undestandings that effortlessly and joyfully move me to greater understanding! And I have discovered such clarity and understanding in ""Journey of the Soul.""The author has elegantly described a process of ""an unfolding spiritual reality"" which spans vast areas of inquiry such as God, the Divine Feminine, mysticism, creation, purpose, states of consciousness, faith, surrender, wisdom, and love. He built this process in such a fascinating and sometimes poetic way that I am now confident that as I continue my journey, I have a clearer idea of what exactly I am looking for!Read slowly and savor the illumination!Priceless!"
5,Peace of mind and body,"Mr. Alton does a commendable job of combining Eastern and Western medicinal philosophies, with easy-to-understand chapters and diagrams. I've been fortunate to live in Charlottesville and study with Mr. Alton. This book gives everyone not located in the Charlottesville area the opportunity to take advantage of ""Unified Fitness"". The system is easy to follow and well laid out in the book. The ultimate result does depend on the individual. ""Unified Fitness"" has to be incorporated into your life to obtain the most benefit.""Unified Fitness"" combines mind and body exercises that really work. Alton also touches on diet and coping with stress in the modern world in addition to examining the micro-biology of his program's effects. Mr. Alton has an extensive background in Qigong, Martial Arts, and Eastern/Western medicine. For someone who is looking for peace of mind and body, I couldn't recommend a better book for your overall health."
3,Interesting Local History,"This is a typical local history of interest to local people and to specialist completist collectors. No grand analysis here.Just the stories of individuals caught up in hostilities, most of whom preferred to be let alone."
4,Great!,"I really liked C&C Music Factory when they came out, Boriqua Anthem being one of my all time favorite dance tunes. Though this work is a compilation of several other CD's it still flows well. In the original CD's there's a tighter sequencing but thsi is still a fabulous dance/exercise CD to have on hand."
4,Special remixes of the original songs.,"I like 8 out of the 10 songs here. The only songs I don't like are ""Keep It Comin'"" and ""Take A Toke"" because of very bad or weird lyrics."
4,"Wow, I thought comments at conferences were tough :)","I guess what I like about the text is what most of you dislike: his comments on scientific discourse and the nature of science. Kudos to him for doing ""BIG SCIENCE."" More people should. Now I am speaking for the American system here but t&p; creates more technicians then it does scientists.I think Joao demystifies the process of science; it ain't no cookbook nor is it something only a bunch of dead white guys can do. It's that sense of wonder about life (physical and not) that keeps you childlike with wonder and humble enough to realize that we may only generate some really good questions about life, never complete answers."
2,This Has Nothing To Do WIth FTL Travel,"I thought this might be another FTL travel speculation book when I picked it up. I was very dissapointed to learn the book has almost nothing to say about FTL travel at all. Instead this is an attempt to convey a theory other than inflation to explain how the universe got from the big bang to the state we see today.The first half of the book is a good recap of the theories os inflation and general and special relativity. This part of the book is well written, concrete, and easy to follow. The second half of the book is very dissapointing. It starts to get very squishy in a hurry. After reading it I had no idea what the theory was or what it stood for, other than being a direct frontal assault on Einstein's work. The second half of the book is filled with rants about other scientists, journal editors, and university administrators, but there is very little science.I think that without a catchy title, this book would never have been printed at all."
1,VSL? Where's the VSL discussion?,"I'll be brief, which is more than I can say for the author.There is very little science in this book & a whole lot of complaining about ""the process"". Herr Magueijo does a credible job of putting Einstein's theories into a form that the average non-cosmologist can comprehend but that's about it.Most of the book is the author's self-induced ego-boost describing how he triumphed over the ""idiots"" of the peer-review process & got his paper(s) published in spite of their best efforts to stymie him. His descriptions of VSL (which is what I thought the book was ultimately supposed to be about...) really don't describe anything.If you want a fairly light dissection of relativity (& can suffer thru the cow analogies) then read this book. But borrow it from the local library, don't waste your kopeks buying it......"
2,Cosmology Theory or Educational System Diatribe,The author spends way too much of the book in a diatribe about what he views as problems in the British educational system. I was disapointed that this was more about the author's trials and tribulations in the education system than about current cosmology. When the author does discuss his theory he holds back on the conceptual details because he claims the reader wouldn't be able to understand them. A book for the lay reader on complex technical topics needs a reasonably simple model to convey the essence of the topic to be useful. The author does provide reasonable models when discussing special and general relativity but leaves the reader wanting on his own theories. The bottom line -- the discussion of the education system gets in the way of too little cosmology content.
3,Just a small correction...,"Joo Magueijo is a Portuguese cosmologist working in the UK. I intend to buy his book and read it soon, then you'll have my opinion about it."
1,Offensive and Trivial,"Definitely not worth the read.. The book is little more than a meandering autobiography of a young, well-educated man who badly needs to grow up. He makes every effort to offend everyone, including most of his fellow cosmologists and all technical editors, then complains bitterly how everyone is against him. He even goes out of his way to offend his readers, with a sprinkling of totally unnecessary four-letter words. Although I have long advocated the concept of a speed of light variable with time, but not of space, Magueijo gets himself totally wrapped around the axle trying develop such a concept without in any way offending his personal God Albert Einstein (heresy!). Is this where modern &#65533;science&#65533; has gone?"
2,"Bias, philosophy, and some science too","If you would like an illustration of how one's personal biases, philosopies, and political views influence their ""science"", this is the book for you. The author proves the case that pure science is as rare as theories that actually predict outcomes."
2,Boring,"No doubt, details about publishing papers in the world of physics is of interest to those in the field. But to a general reader such as myself, the long discussions of fighting with this editor and being enraged at that referee, was quite boring. The science is basic and, except for the author's own fringe theory, covered better in many other popular accounts. Save your money."
2,High Speed Train Fan,I ordered this and then found it for a MUCH cheaper price at ToysRUs so I decided to return it since I did not open the box. The company it was sent from is based in England (Otherland Toys) so it would cost me half the price of the toy just to ship it back. I'm annoyed that I bought the item in the US and it was not specified that it would sent from abroad. I would not buy it again just for the inconvenience of how long it takes to get the item and how much it costs to send it back.BRIO Shinkansen Train
2,Deservingly lost in the mix,"The title track barely made an appearance on radio airwaves, and then it was forgotten. Some of this sounds like softer Filter, incorporating some electronic elements while retaining a definite rock sound. These guys almost seem to be ""going through the motions"" on these tracks; fairly simple (yet none too driving) guitar parts (alternation between TWO chords too often) abound, and lyrics seem bereft of genuine emotion. Granted, this is by no means a particularly bad approach to rock--nor is it an unpleasant listen--it just lacks the oomph to leave a lasting impression. Not only will intermittent listening render one unable to place the single's title with music (save perhaps the chirping falsetto oo-oo bridge); you won't remeber this seemingly random-named band either. This is a decent everyband."
4,This is a great book!,This book is a great summary of the law of homeowners' associations in Florida. It is written in a way that is easily understandable by non-lawyers. It is a great resource for board members of homeowners' associations.
2,not that great...,"I got this airsoft gun just for fun and i'm not that serius about it, but it doesn't work very good. It is easily jammed and then the bb's will fall out all over the place. It also sucks that it will only hold 10 bb's. It's pretty much what I expected for the price."
2,Still wondering...,"This author was recommended by [...] Italian Language Guide and, having read and liked several other recommendations of this Guide, I was eager to submerge myself still deeper in Italian Culture. Perhaps I selected poorly. ""A Place to Live"" was claimed to be one of her best works but I just couldn't get the relationship that I was looking for...perhaps the one she was looking for also. I know I expect a lot from my reading and am often disappointed. I may still read another of her works... hopefully this one won't leave me still wondering."
2,Good for making a mushy mess,"I have a mini-cuisinart and a full sized one, but since I received this herb processor as a gift, I thought I'd give it a shot. Well, after a day of trying to chop herbs and mince garlic with it, I'd rather spend the extra time setting up and cleaning the mini-cuisinart. I found that most of the time, this herb processor just mashes everything up, or crushes it, no matter what blade I use. Juices from the herbs or garlic just leak out, weakening their overall flavor and limiting their usefulness. If I need to quickly chop some herbs, I'd rather just do it by hand or by cuisinart."
4,Exceptional!,"~An impressive sophomoric hit by this English band, headed by the beautiful Sonya Madan. Clearly"
3,One of the underrated bands of mid 90's Britpop,"Echobelly is perhaps one of the most underrated bands of the mid 90's Britpop wave. 'On' combines the guitar swagger of Oasis and the brooding sound of The Smiths. Debbie Smith on rhythm guitar adds these sweeping guitar-washes, giving their sound a subtle wall-of-sound effect. But the obvious centerpiece of Echobelly is the silky-sweet vocals of Sonya Madan, almost like a pixielike geisha, seductive yet packs a powerful punch. But I've always found that Echobelly strays beyond the boundaries of typical mid 90's indie-pop, an ecclectic chemistry adding an unconventional spin to their sound. Bittersweet. Crooning crystalline vocals with a slightly worldly bent, raw guitar brashness as a backdrop to an exotic seductress. This is still Britpop but with a unique twist, and just like Sonya Madan's voice...seductive but packs a powerful punch."
1,Lightweight,Basia is very overrated.I find her to be a 2nd tier Lounge act version of Sade.her remake of Aretha Franklin's until you come back to me is really Lame.Very run of the mill material.
5,The next best thing to seeing her live!,"Usually live albums are duds and prove the artist is stalling for time until their next studio album or has run out of ideas. Neither apply here (although Basia does take her time between discs!). Basia On Broadway captures her energy and enthusiasm without losing anything in the translation. I've seen her three times in concert and this captures it perfectly; sans visuals natch! The live versions don't stray too far from the studio originals but have just enough spark, vitality and improvision to keep them from becoming rote. A good starting point for those new to Basia and reminder to those who like her to make sure and see her on the next tour!"
3,Five Forks and Five Pages,"Alexander's book Five Forks is an interesting book, rich in primary references. In fact it seems like most of the book has Alexander acting as editor and moving from one quote or fact to another. In many ways it was an enoyable read though it was a quick one. I was however disappointed that the book has very little to do with the Battle of Five Forks. It scarely mentioning the battle thru almost the first 100 pages except to bring up the much discussed Shad picnic."
5,Excellent Book,"This book provides an excellent overview of Michelangelo's life. The writing is fabulous, but it's the pictures that make the book great. The illustrations are amazing."
3,Not the Real Thing,"I thought the reproductions would be of real Michelangelo paintings; however they appear to be amateur copies of the original, a frustrating outcome to my expectations. I did enjoy the biographical story told and the interesting revelations about his life. I guess this book is more for youngsters, but that should be made clear to the purchaser."
2,OK but redundant,"I liked the story well enough, but agree with a lot of the other reviewers in that it could have been written and edited a lot better. I wonder if they realized there's something called a thesaurus out there? Certain cliche phrases are used too often. I would probably read more from her, but my expectations are pretty low."
1,Quite possibly the worst written book ever,"I had high expectations for this book. Was I ever disappointed. The story was unbelievable, the characters were as thin as a sheet of paper, and the dialogue read as if it had been written by a 13 year old. It was frustrating to read, because the dialogue just unraveled any interest I may have had in the plot. I was really shocked when I saw a picture of Fern Michaels. I would have bet that she was a very young author. Since she has been writing for over 30 years, there is no excuse for a book with such minimal plot and character development. To be fair, the concept of the book was weak, but a better author could have done more to make the book readable. Cartoon villians, inconsistent voice given to the comic relief of the grandmother and her servants, and a love interest who we are supposed to believe never got past his first love when he was 13. What a mess."
1,Drag...,I must say Fern Michaels was again a disappointment. the plot of the book was too weak to actually write over 400 pages on it.it was very boring that I skipped through most of the pages and in the end; the big secret was too cliched in my opinion. Cady's romantic interest; Boomer the police chief wasnt strong enough for a main character and so was their romance for that matter. Lola was too fake. I actually felt sorry for Amy and i think our author is obsessed with dogs. you may borrow this book from a library or whatever but do not buy it in any circumstances.
1,"Dull, Predictable, and a Complete Snooze","This is the first Fern Michaels book that I have read and based on all the other reviews I really thought I would enjoy it. Wrong!! This book started out slow and never even got up to a crawl. Perhaps it would have been a bit more exciting if the reader didn't know up front what had happened ""that day"". I am rather klutzy myself, but I have never seen someone have such a hard time keeping their clothes on as Cady does. The 'old trio' further served to add to the goofiness level of the book, but the ending was beyond ridiculous. True, I could hardly put the book down, but that was primarily so I could get through it and start something much more interesting. This will most likely be the first and last Fern Michaels novel I read."
2,Not the worst but that isn't saying a lot,"Fiction is not reality....take a deep breath and tell yourself this before you pick up this book with all of your good intentions. I admit that I have not read very many Fern Michaels books, but I recall thinking the same thing about a previous book of hers. The heroine in this book is completely ridiculous. I don't think you are supposed to be hoping the heroine will accidentally get hit by a Twinkie truck during the course of the book you are reading, but unfortunately I was. There is no really strong storyline to this book and the characters end up behaving like little kids in a fight over a toy. I understand that all fiction has an element of fantasy but this was truly a pathetic example of why we pay for books as entertainment."
2,Just not a Fern Michaels fan...,"Okay, this is the third book of hers that I have read, and they are all written in the same childish way. The writing is stilted and the characters are just silly. In this book, the characters are not even likable, even Cady, the ""heroine."" The dialogue is too simplistic and the book was about 300 pages too long. I am not sure why Michaels is supposedly a great author- the books I have read are very dissapointing. I won't be picking any more of her books up to read."
2,Oh...My...God!,"Can't believe I actually finished this book. Could not find a single likeable character in the entire book, never mind realistic.Even ended up disliking the female character thoroughly and sympathizing with the ""bad guy"". All that stuff about Cody being so sweet(yuck!)... Not my idea of a sweet girl, she's just so shallow and dumb! After reading the book, I wouldn't mind tossing a rock at her myself."
2,Very hard to read....,"I just couldn't get into the book. The writing seemed choppy. I didn't feel much for the characters. Skipped many pages because I was just bored. I did read the end though and it just seemed a little odd...especially the whole shower thing. Many parts of the book just left me hanging and were not explained in enough depth to make it ""realistic"" and plausable.Not impressed at all with this book."
1,This book will go down as one of the worst I have ever read,I don't even know where to begin except to say I'd like the 4 hours back I wasted on this book. I can't stand to start a book & not finish it but I wish I had set it down after a few pages. It stinks! I read it to the end & it's horrible. Do NOT waste your time.
3,A slight disappointment,"When I picked up this book, I was expecting a little more... after reading the reviews previously posted, I thought it would be stellar. I found that it was too predictable for my liking. I did enjoy the read, but it did not satisfy me in the way I expected. I was a little disappointed."
1,Just say no.,I won't bother reiterating what everyone else has already said about this just horrible book. Poorly written? That's an understatement. I can't believe anyone would publish this--except for the fact that they knew Fern Michaels fans all over the world would be silly enough to buy it despite the reviews. Just a really bad book. Avoid at all costs! And don't buy it just to find out how horrible it is! Take my word for it! BAD! You'll never get those hours back.
4,fun gift,I bought this book to send to my siblings instead of a birthday card. It is a fun little book for anyone who grew up with siblings or has more than one child of their own.
3,A good pick - even for a non-classical music fan.,"I learned of this album while listening to the public radio station. The station played two tracks and I liked them enough to order the CD. I had never heard of the artist before and I can't say that I am knowledgeable in classical or guitar music. However, this is a good easy-listening CD - great for at work or driving home after a wild day at work! I will definately consider more of Liona Boyd's work."
2,Minor league prog-rockers.,"This compilation exposes CAMEL for what they were, a second rate British prog-rock outfit. The compositions are weak, the lyrics mundane. It is atmospherics that CAMEL tend to excel in. Unfortunately, once the drugs wear off(and for many of us that was college in the seventies) so does the interest. The other reality that is exposed in this compilation, is that CAMEL got progressively worse over time revealing a band that didn't know when to pack it in. There are better bands out there worthy of your money and attention. Consider early Genesis(before Steve Hackett left), 70's era Yes & King Crimson, Gentle Giant, PFM, ELP, and pre-eighties Jethro Tull for starters...Simon"
2,Mediocre prog rock,"I am a huge fan of prog rock. I have heard various songs (both studio and live) from Camel in the past and liked some a lot. However, after listening to this 2 disk set, I have to say that Camel are a band that I will not be following in the future. They have their moments, but often I find the song writing uneven, the vocals dull, and the musical production fair."
4,j.eixeres absolute fan,"As the rest of Camel's fans, it's hard to make a compilation for every fan's taste, but even so the CD is specially indicated to all that people who wants to resume a musical legend called Camel in only 2 cd's and be introduced within the ""simpho-rock"" of 70's and earlier 80's. Great melodies in all tracks, exceptionally well performed musical instruments, specially guitarist Andrew Latimer, absolute leader after Peter Bardens era. I would be critic in one sense: why ""Unevensong"" was not included???? Try it in album Rain Dances. Absolutely great!!"

4,Cute story!,This is a very cute Read with me DVD. I enjoy the images used in the story. My four year old son loves this storyline and has loads of fun with the games he can play.
5,drug accessory,THIS IS THE closest i have ever come to complete psychedelic bliss next to pink floyd
2,Repeating riffs,This album is just boring same riffs repeating over and over again - its played with such a style so you get dead tired of it after hearing it once. The the drummer uses the clash and ride drum constantly...The album Frost is a little more atmospheric but still...I can't believe that those reviewrs above me gave it 5 stars
2,"No patterns, not what I expected","This is a compendium of pictures and history of the makers for a juried show.No patterns, not much on the really rare animals I had hoped for.I'd really like to return it.Also had marking in it, like someone had tried to edit the book after printing."
3,Blues history!!! (with Motown backup singers??),"John Sinclair is clearly a very big fan of the delta blues, and his spoken word tales of famous bluesmen of past are very colourful and entertaining. The music behind his reading is raw and energetic. It would be a great album, but for the misplaced female backup singers behind him, doing the occasional ""woo wooooo"" or similar. Sinclair's Full Circle album is a much better choice than this one. Same idea, but much, much cooler."
1,Stodgy Performance in Heavily Compressed Sound,"Do not waste your money on this one. The sound receives such dynamic compensation and compression that there is no audible difference between ff and pp dynamics. A tragedy, seeing as the orchestra is on top form. There is no ambience or bloom to the sound and Karajan's performance sounds weighty and vertical and never takes flight. It is one-dimensional severe Tchaikovsky. The sound also gets chopped off at the ends of movements, perhaps to edit out applause, but gives the production a cartoony, clinical feel. The picture also loses in its very distracting camera-work and editing. Perhaps the momentously electrical live account with Zander in Boston's Jordan Hall will eventually see the light of day. This DVD is a disgrace to Karajan's often superb abilities."
2,Slow and confusing,"The story was potentially interesting but boy was it confusing, strange at times and too often very slow. The nuns ending up being a bunch of hit ladies was about the last nail in the coffin for this one, and then it wound up with a live pet lamb that had a bomb planted inside it. Too strange for sure. I am surprised I sat through all of this film. I kept thinking things might start to make sense and by the end some of it did, but the strange nonsense that occurred within it and some of the confusing characters never did."
2,Don't Bother unless you want to burn up 2 hours and 20 minutes of your life.,"2 Stars for a Good Cast0 Stars for a really bad storyI don't want to give anything away for those planning to watch it, but this film has great cinematography, a great cast and a crappy story. I walked away thinking Volcano Cult and Exploding Animals????? You watch it to figure out what I mean. This film has a train wreck of a story. Luckily it was a free watch on Prime otherwise I would want my money back."
1,Great cast....but that's it.,This should have and could have been a 90 minute thriller. Instead we have 139 minutes of convoluted nonsense.Bad editing all around.A plot that cries for more viable dialogue.Characters that yearn and require deeper understanding.Erratic cinematography.At the end of it you kind of know what happened but you don't really care.That's the responsibility of the director. To make his audience relate and involve their emotions. It never happens.A truly great cast headed by the wonderful Harvey Keitel who can't save this one.Even the credits are bizarre.A waste of time.
2,Back on the bookshelf,"I was hopeful that I would be able to use this book, but I could not get past some of the inane breakthroughs -- such as the ""great"" idea that cupcake liners can also be used for muffins. Come on! If this is news to the author, then I can't imagine what kind of real experience she has in a kitchen at all. So instead of finding a place on my kitchen counter, this book is in a middle of a stack on my bookshelf. It has a cute cover, at least."
1,This author is not a nutritionist,I am currently taking a nutrition class and we have learned the art of determining what information is quackery and which is not. Please refer the link here which states that the CNC is a bogus credential. You have to have a degree to actually be a registered dietition or a eal nutritionist. Just want you to be informed people. I do not own the cookbook but knowing that the CNC title can be obtained by taking an open book test I can't say I would believe there is sound nutritional advise in every regard. I also read that Fiber content was not listed in the nutrition facts and since Fiber is such a huge issue in nutrition and in prevention of certain diseases I would want to know the exact fiber content of each serving/recipe.http://www.quackwatch.org/search/webglimpse.cgi?ID=1&query;=CNC
4,Kudos (not the processed kind),"Kudos to the author for writing this book. Avoiding ""bad"" foods does not always result in a nutritious diet. In this book, basic nutrition is followed by nutritious - and mainstream - recipes. What would have been useful is a section describing how to increase the nutritional content of existing recipes without changing their essense. But there is good content in this book. One surprise - the author also takes a hardline with firm tofu: forget it. It was truly liberating. Instead of obsessing with incorporating tofu into our diet, I decided to have more fun with other nutritious foods that we like better. And this book is intended to be fun and is targeted to parents. There are few better gifts to give children than a nutritious diet and an understanding of nutrition."
3,Lippman has written far better books,"I like Laura Lippman, but this one falls flat. Boring plot, boring writing, just plain boring. Don't waste your money on this one-she has written better than this, so buy her novels, like ""What the Dead Know""."
2,Very sloppy writing,"A short way into Chapter I, we have ""...the world had such a large supply of girls, and an even larger supply of perverts."" Really? More perverts than girls? A few pages later, Tess, our heroine, drugs one of these perverts with his own Rohypnol, strips him of his clothes, except for his ""briefs and socks"", and throws his clothes in a dumpster. But in the next sentence ""she arranged his wallet, keys, and pager in a pile next to his head and draped his jacket over him."" Without bothering to retrieve the jacket from the dumpster. There are more examples like these.When a writer has so little control over the world she creates that absurdities and oxymorons populate it more densely than her characters, I stop reading pretty quickly. So in fairness I have to say that I only read the first ten percent of this book. Maybe it improves later."
5,The Last Place is a Winning Place to Be,"This is wonderful PI story, that I couldn't put down. As I started to read it, I recognized many references to Baltimore Blues,the first in the Tess Monaghan series. I immediately went and reread Baltimore Blues, and was glad I did. The Last Place answers many of the questions remaining from the first book.As a mystery on its own, it is powerful and extremely well written. I do hope Laura Lippman doesn't wait too long for another installment."
4,Female Marlowe,This the first book I've read by Ms. Lippman and I came away quite impressed. She does an excellent job of crafting the mystery ( a seemingly unrelated string of homicides). P.I. Tess Monahan is real person - ie. she has flaws and demons. The writing is excellent.
1,"Cheap, cheap, cheap","This is the worst kitchen tool I've yet purchased. I had it about two months. First off, it gives your hand quite a workout to get enough pepper on your food. Second, aiming the pepper/salt takes some getting used to, as it doesn't land exactly where you expect it should.Last, the materials are cheap and flimsy. After what I would consider minimal use, the handles broke while dispensing pepper. Again, the device broke within two months of purchase.Buy this, and you'll most likely regret it."
3,o.k. but flimsy,"I loved this for the 6-8 months I had it. But, its flimsy and the thing broke while i was using it. I think I'm going to buy another one though. It's pricey and cheaply made but works great."
2,A disappointment,"Granted, grinding fresh cracked pepper or salt is not an exact science as far as ""aiming"" the finished product where you want it to go in (or on) a dish, but this is really awkward to use. Even after practice, I've found if I actually just want to salt and pepper one item on the plate, I have to steady the grinder with one hand while working the lever with the other. The grind is a bit inconsistent as well. I thought it looked nice, and it does, but it's not too terribly functional."
1,Junky - broke in about 3 months,"Bought this at the local cooks specialty store based on the salespersons recommendation. I like the idea of one tool for salt and pepper and one-handed use. I've used it quite a bit in my kitchen. It doesn't give much salt or pepper with each squeeze as others have commented and after 3 months, the handle finally broke. Probably OK for on-the-table use or casual use (it's ""cute""), but for really cooking with it, forget it. I won't buy one again."
4,"Seeing the ""New Testament"" in a newer light","Hugh Schonfeld, a self-described Hebrew Christian, made a valiant, idealistic attempt to reconcile ""Christianity"" and ""Judaism"" by rearranging, re-translating,and otherwise trying to restore what purports to be a more historically accurate,less alienated, less alienating post-Tanack (Hebrew-Aramaic Bible)account of activities and principles of Yeshua bar Miriam (alias Jesus). It's something of a stretch. As Rabbi Sherwin Wine has written (""A Provocative People: A Secular History of the Jews""), it's virtually impossible to construct a reliable history of Jesus/Yeshua in any detail. Nahum Glatzer's ""Hillel, the Elder"" and Rabbi Joseph Telushkin's ""Hillel, If Not Now, When"", provide a more reliable guide to the period and a more useful philosophical guide than anything I have yet seen about ""Jesus"". Students, scholars and truth-seekers be aware."
2,Not an Architect,"Unless you're an archirect, which I am not, this a very difficult book to understand. The terminology is unique to architects, and without some explanation, the layman has no idea what the author is talking about.I had expected more illustrations and photos of Michelangelo's works, and was disappointed with what I got."
4,An appropriate and timely look into church history,"While, as another reviewer indicated, anyone familiar with Church history will not be thrilled by new revelations, this book's review of history takes an unusually critical perspective from within Roman Catholic Christianity. Kung's writing is flawless, bringing a fresh taste of excitement where history runs dry.The aim of this book is similar to other works by Kung (a now-discredited Roman Catholic theologian), in that it attempts to expose the hypocrisy and problems of Papal infallibility and its practice. In fact, i cannot think of a writer that has harped this particular theme more elegantly than Kung, except maybe Martin Luther. And short of accusing the Papalcy of being the anti-christ as Luther does, Kung's distaste for its errors and inappropriate teachings throughout history raises relevant questions about the state of Papal power today, if not its relevance altogether."
3,One side of the issue,"Hans Kung surely knows what he is talking about. This book however sounds quite angry, much more so than the more moderate and deeper ""Christianity"", which is of course much thicker.The one problem I have after reading his book is that if there was nothing more to church history than all these negative facts, it would not have survived 2000 years. Histories of the church seem all to focus on politics, power and intrigues. What about thinkers, philosophers, theologians and ""regular folks"" who really kept religion alive?I am still looking for a more balanced history of the church. Kung's ""Christianity"" was, I felt, more balanced."
2,Romantic and unbalanced,"While Kung may provide a well-placed theological insight now and again, overall his history is marked by a romantic view of the early church community that is at times erroneous or exaggerated best. He is a good story teller who, at times, is not honest about his topic and unbalanced in his judgments. I never will disuade anyone from reading any book. Therefore this book should be read with a critical eye and a running list of challenges that compel the reader to deeper study and explanation of often generalized and under-argued conclusions."
1,catholic history for the anti-catholic,"Is there any element of Catholic tradition that this guy likes? If so, he hides it well. Credit the publishers for finding the most anti-Catholic ""Catholic"" intellectual available to write this book. Kung wants, among other things, a rehabilitation of Luther in the Church, reconsideration of the Church's beliefs and teachings on the nature of marriage and human sexuality, and an end to the Pope's role as final arbiter of disputes within the Church. A well-written book, but one that tells the reader a lot more about those who object to Catholicism than about the Church. At the end, the thoughtful reader has to ask, ""Why isn't this guy a Protestant?"" Try the more reliable H. W. Crocker's ""Triumph"" for a more balanced and theologically reliable view of the Church."
1,This book is unresearched and factually errant,"Being a history buff, I usually enjoy a good historical chronology. Kung's work is neither good nor historical. It is propaganda crafted to suit his own agenda.None of his historical accounts, beginning with the early church through the Holocaust to present day, are accurate. The facts he did give which were true, were only true in part and presented with a distinctive bias. On other issues, Kung lied, pure and simple, especially in regards to Pope Nicholas I, Pius XII, the role of Constantine in Rome, and so on.As a Catholic, Kung questions whether or not Christ actually founded a Church (read Matthew and John), doubts the Holy Trinity, papal primacy and most of the basic tenets of the Church. He is pro-choice, for the ordination of women to the priesthood and the compromise of basic Catholic dogma in favor of ecuminism.The facts are in error and his conclusions are garbage. Don't waste your time or money on this book.....Peace,Ann"
1,A SHORT (BIASED) HISTORY,"This book is not so much a history, as it is a platform for the author's controversial and liberal viewpoint. This 200 page diatribe has virtually nothing good to say about the Catholic church. He definitely has an axe to grind, probably because of the Vatican's censure in 1979, banning his teachings as a Catholic theologian."
2,A new view of an old church,I was surprised how much the author packed into this little book. The beginning fifty or so pages did a fairly quick history job in explaining events and people. The Vaticun II part read like a liberal wishlist of how to destroy and rebuild the church in their own image. I realized the (Roman) Church is suffering from the many recent events but most are caused by what appears as the liberal agenda from within. I'm sure the American Catholic Church will use this as a gathering point for their new theology and use it to their advantage.
4,"thought provoking, informative, but light on details","this was a well written, very interesting book that gave me a pretty good overview of the history of post-Jesus Christianity and the Catholic Church. i still see myself looking for a more traditional history book on this topic, though, as the author focussed more on the effects of actions and events on the church more so than the actions and events themselves. the author also assumes a certain level of understanding of the Catholic Church and it's structure, which made some of the passages tough to navigate. one warning- have a dictionary at hand- i've never even seen some of the words he uses!"
3,Not an easy read (even for a catholic),"Whether it is the style of writing, the English translation from German or the assumed reader knowledge without much explanation of many phrases (Marianism; monotheism, numerous latin terms etc) this book is not an easy read.That's a pity as the actual basic story of how the Church of Rome ended up as it did with all the critical landmarks being fully covered in its 200 pages as a practicing catholic I found very helpful. Issues of celibacy causing the recent scandals that have hit the Vatican plus contraception, attitudes to Nazism, Islam and Judaism have their root causes explained, though due to personal involvement too much time is probably spent on the 2nd Ecumenical Council.A useful primer but hard work hence the 3 stars."
2,Why the pope dissed me so I'll rip on him for 200 pages.,"Hans Küng is a very learned man. Reading this as if he's lecturing at Tübingen gives me the sense he knows thousand of pages of information and had a hard time distilling it into 200. But clearly, the high point of his life was having his only liked pope, John XIII, name him a theological consultant to Vatican II. The low point was having John Paul II censure him for what seem to me are some off-the-wall views. If only the laity and his theologian buddies could vote - then Hans could get his ideas passed as Church rules! But alas, that wretched papacy got in the way! Thus, we have a emotionally scarred, vindicative person racing through history, selecting every bit of evidence to prove the papacy is the ""gang that couldn't shoot straight"". Makes me wonder why there are 850,000,000 Catholics instead of 85. And makes me certain that if he ever writes a short of history of me I'm getting on his good side!"
2,Pales To Invisibility From Original,"I really looked forward to this mini-series and was left disappointed. As some of the previous reviews have suggested, the project would have been much better had the story been written around the science and suspense, rather than around political ranting.I hoped to be entertained by the show but was left with nothing much positive outside of a deeper appreciation for the quality of the original."
2,2nd half departs from the original,"I have to give this adaption some credit for creating a new plot that explains the origin of the Andromeda strain. I thought the time travel idea was explained reasonably well enough, but the whole thing got just a bit too silly for my own taste. By the end of the movie, it is left as a time travel paradox. The original movie had some logical lapses, but it was so enthralling. This adaption doesn't have the chilling self-destruct sequence of the original: instead, it delivers something pretty silly. The real climax of the adapation is not the self-destruct sequence, but more conspiracies and coverups.One viewing on TV is enough for me. If I decide to buy a DVD, I'll get the one for the original movie, maybe along with 'OUTBREAK', which is a pretty good effort in the 'germ disaster' genre."
1,Poor!,"I'm a fan of the original 1971 movie. The original is more science and way less conspirancy theory. Most reviews here covered alot of the details, my advice is skip this version."
3,Derails in the second half,"The first half of this version of The Andromeda Strain mirrors the original movie, which in turn follows Michael Crichton's novel (his first and best, written long before he went insane). After that it derails. Logical holes in the script the size of the Grand Canyon (discussing them would require spoilers so I won't) crop up once the writers depart from the original story. Although I'm in agreement with the movie's message, I think it becomes too preachy to work as entertainment. Not awful but not great. I think it deserves 2 1/2 stars."
1,"Strain me Not Please, I'll throw this piece of junk in the trash.","I've read the book and the closest one that ever came to respecting the book would have to be the 71 version with robert wise directing. i was purely disgusted by this latest remake, which as many people have pointed out didn't need to be made in the first place. Michael Crichton probably crawled underneath a rock in total embarrassment over how they ruin his story in this version, why he gave them the green light to do this i'll never know. read the book or watch the classic 1971 version. but don't waste your time on watching this junk."
1,A Real Sleeper,"I read the book and saw the original movie years ago and was looking forward to seeing the remake. Since I was away for the weekend when this was broadcast, I recorded it for future viewing. So far I have fallen asleep three times without getting through it. Somehow I get the feeling that I'm not really missing much. I just can't seem to get engrossed enough to stay awake."
1,One word....Terrible,"I was really looking forward to this event on A&E; and I have to say if they had just stuck to the original storyline, this might have worked, but all the junk they added on top made it a terrible watch.I have no idea what's going on with Tony/Ridley Scott but lately, their work has been lacking greatly. I hope that Michael C. had nothing to do with this project, as this is probably the worst MC adaptation since Timeline.What's wrong with the state of Science Fiction these days??? Can't we tell a good SF story anymore?"
5,The Andromeda Strain Remake-Excellent!,"I don't know why this movie scored so poorly with Amazon reviewers. The basic story was excellent, and this version did nothing to detract from that good starting point. I think if the original film had not been made this film would have scored a much higher average. Having started out with a great plot and script it was totally updated with great CGI and fantastic special effects which were only a small part of this films cinematic accomplishments. I still enjoy the original, but this one was a great remake."
4,Better than the Film Version,Based on a Geniouses Book. The Andromeda Strain Mini-Series did what the filf could not. It featured 3 Hours of straight from the page content. i have read the book. Yes its better than the movie or series but this gets the closest to campturing its escense.
1,What's the point?,"If you feel like being preached at, if you feel like watching a retread, if you feel like wasting your time on a movie that did not need to be remade, this movie is for you. Dull characters and dull dialogue abound.What was the point in making this movie?"
1,"A joke, only good as Camp","What a sad new version of the original Andromeda Strain. I know TV movies are made on the cheap, but this is exceptionally bad. Every cliche in the book. First you might need actors playing scientists that don't seem like they would have trouble getting through high school. Some scenes are so utterly ridiculous they must be putting us on. The director, writers, and producers owe us an apology for wasting our time and having the temerity to use the name 'Andromeda Strain'."
1,WATCH THE ORIGINAL,IT IS UNFORTUNATE I CAN NOT WRITE GARBAGE TWENTY TIMES TO COMPLETE THIS REVIEW . A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. THE 1971 VERSION WAS FAR BETTER. BENNIE BRAT IS JUST A PRETTY FACE.
2,Not Bad If You Haven't Read The Book,I watched this with an open mind. I must say that to be honest if you haven't read the book this is an ok miniseries... but just ok. I have read the book and still didn't mind it but I don't like a lot of the stuff they added that wasn't in the book just for dramatic effect. It didn't need it. Not a bad cast but not one that I would have picked.It is worth a peek. I got it at Walmart for $10.
1,Horrible!,"The 1971 film version of The Andromeda Strain is a classic. Done in a very scientific-medical fashion that lent it a feel of reality-docudrama more than a movie, the 1971 movie remains one of the best Michael Crichton movies ever done. This REmake is nothing of the sort. Horrible acting. Bad dialogue. And the ""thumb scene"" at the end was the bad icing on a very bad cake!I am a huge fan of the original. Probably my single most watched movie ever! Absolutely fantastic in every way, and about as perfect a film as one can get.The remake is the direct opposite! Avoid it like, well, the plague!"
5,love the remake,"Even though the remake was not as good as the original, i did love it, and was still entertained by it."
2,Another remake,"Tony & Ridley Scott's remake of THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN is yet another example of a remake that is vastly inferior to the original. I actually sat through both nights and have to agree with other reviewers that when they start dragging wormholes, the future, it starts to unravel pretty quickly. What the Betty Ford candidate reporter had to do with anything is pretty tenuous at best. See Robert Wise's original. You'll feel better."
1,TRASH,"I had hi hopes for this film and was really let down. The first half was actually rather good and stuck to the book and the first, and MUCH better movie, quite well with a bit added into it that turned out in the second half to be VERY irrelevant.The second half of this was the exact opposite of the first half. It was at best sophomoric. I honestly believe that a child could have written it with all the silly and unnecessary plot takes and so called twists and the outright silliness that it all turned into.It was a total waste of time as it takes a great story and turns it into a joke."
1,It's Battlestar Galactica Meets Buck Rodgers Meets Stargate,"In Michael Crichton's quest to make more money we once again have this lousy book made into yet another lousy movie. Like the 1971 version wasn't bad enough? Cheesy dialogue, Star Trek technology rip offs and an Stargate like military officers makes this four hours of pain. Maybe the writer's were on strike when they made this because I have seen better script writing from a bunch of 6th graders. A&E I would ask the producers for your money back."
3,Better than the original,I'm usually the last guy to say the remake was better than the original but I really liked that this one.What I guess I liked most about this one was that the writers and director or whoever decided to move this out of the lab and into the world and I think a younger cast made it possible as the first time around the cast were older and not equipt to do action scenes which made for a slower movie.What I didn't like as much was the CGI effects I thought they lacked weight and pressence.When done right CGI can be terrific as in Jurassic Park where the mix of sound and CGI helped give the CGI weight or in The Perfect Storm with the huge wave effects the sound played a big part in making you feel like these things were possible.The effects were not as bad as a SCi-Fi channel movie but were not much better.A few bucks more spent on the effects and it might have been better.
1,Arrived damaged!,"I was really excited to try this dvd. Unfortunately, it was not packed well, and arrived damaged. I didn't realize this until I tried to view it, and the dvd wouldn't view past the first six minutes. Since Amazon won't accept returned items that are unwrapped, I basically wasted my money."
4,Ouch,This workout is intense. I haven't been able to finsih the video but I can see where it would really make a difference in your abdominals.
3,It's OK; nothing that impressive,"It's a good workout but nothing that innovative. The majority of the exercises are common ones. I did it sporatically for about a month without seeing any spectacular results and now the DVD is somewhere in the basement. If you don't know anything about exercise or working out your abs, then maybe this is not a bad choice."
4,Awesome quick workout but....,This workout was great. Abs and core are definitely the focus here but every part of the body gets a good workout. The only negative I really have is the cueing. Tracy is great but she speaks very softly through much of the routine and only throws a cue out every now and then. If you are new to the routine then you have to watch the T.V. the entire time just to know when to stop one thing and go onto the next. There are no counts done for you. I think the routine might be pretty tough for a woman who just gave birth but Tracy does offer alternate ways of doing some of the exercises.
4,Great beginner workout,"I have had 2 c-sections and an age gap of 20 months between and now that my second child is 10 months old I decided to try a fitness dvd at home to get my body back on track. I am back to my pre pregnancy weight but need something for the tone of the muscles. This workout is challenging for me but I'm finding that it's achievable and I do it at my level of fitness and strength. It takes around 50 mins so it's pretty time consuming with 2 kids and my lack of energy, but I'm giving it a go. So far I have found muscles that I forgot I had. All I need to do now is commit to it."
1,Beware: Not a postnatal DVD!,"This should not be marketed as a post-pregnancy DVD! It does not follow guidelines of the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecology. Most of the exerises and positions should not be done until at LEAST 4 months postpardum. A new mom is more likely to become injured from completing this exercise DVD 4-6 times a weeks as suggested than to get back into shape and be motivated to do so.There is so much wrong with this DVD....from lack of instruction, motivation, commentary, timed segments. Just don't buy it! And if this DVD is still appealing to you, please wait a reasonable amount of months before executing the techniques shown. Get yourself a legitimate postnatal workout that makes you look and feel good! I really like the products from Giam and Fitmama for postnatal, but there are lots of good ones out there depending on your style. Good Luck :)"
3,satisfied,this dvd was a decent buy... i was satisfied with the content... i think it will be really beneficial... the only downside is that it is a little on the lengthy side... it's hard to find that much time to work out when you have a newborn... if your child is a little older you might benefit a little more... unless you are willing to work out at the wee hours of the night... :)
3,Not worth the cost,"I like the fact that the background music is mellow and the vibe of the whole DVD is soothing/not intense. The workout is CHALLENGING- which I like. My only complaint is that there are no chapters so if there is a part you want to work on - instead of doing the entire workout- you can not easily do this. With 2 small children it would be nice to be able to move through the DVD easily- pausing when you need to. I'll use the DVD but if I had known that it was not easy to navigate, I would not have purchased it."
5,love it,"I have been doing this video for 3 weeks and after week 1 I was already seeing results. I only do the first 25 minutes of the video, bc after that she goes into legs and arms and I only want to work my abs. It's tough, but each day it gets easier. She doesn't really cue, but the exercises are simple so it's easy to follow. She doesn't talk much, so that's nice bc others like Denise Austin get annoying after a while."
2,Not what I expected,"From the title, I expected there to be some cardio involved in a post pregnancy workout. That is not the case. Although this is a great ab workout, I gave it two stars because I don't think it is worth the money."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"This DVD was very dull and uninteresting to watch. It's the same basic exercise that we are used to seeing. So save your 29.95 and don't let ""Gwyneth"" name entice you. Not worth the money. It ` s not interactive and fail to encourage and motivate ."
2,Boring,This one routine is incredibly boring. The music is dull and fails to motivate. The instruction is minimal. I would recommend Postnatal Conditioning with Teddi Bryant or Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred. Both contain more than one workout routine.
2,Are you kidding me?,"I am very disapointed in Tracy and Gwen. For moms that just had babies this DVD could be completely demoralizing. Very few women have the strength let alone the motivation to get though this. There should be more mention of the fact that this ab workout is insanely difficult and you should do what you can, build your strength and than move on. At first glance it seems impossible and could be very discouraging for many people.Also the workout portion should be divided into chapters.Make sure you are in decent shape before even watching this."
5,Fabulous workout with a great instructor!!!,This is a tough workout and a great deal for the money. I would recommend this to anyone who is serious about getting in shape.
4,GREAT quick workout for new moms!,"This is a great video for brand new moms looking to shrink the ""pooch"" tummy, but could also be good for anyone looking to tone up your stomach! It's got pretty classical music in the background and Tracy's dance background helps you build strong, lean muscles instead of bulk. I didn't like that there is no cardio in the video, but it's great for toning and runs about 50 minutes."
2,not practical for new a new mom,"The content of this workout is great, which is why it's such a disappointment that it is in one long segment. As a new mom, it's hard to find time to work out; sometimes I have to break up my workout into several sessions throughout the day. This is really difficult to do when the dvd is one long 50 minute chapter. The idea of fast forwarding to find where I left off can be a reason not to go back to the workout. Naps can be so short. I don't want to waste time finding where I left off; I'd rather choose another video that has chapters.Also, she gives very little direction and her voice is not very loud at times, making it hard to follow."
3,Good workout needs more cues,"The exercises themselves left me comfortably sore the next day. Only a few gripes about the video. Anderson doesn't talk through the exercises and assumes that you are staring at the tv the whole time. No counts, so you're not sure how many reps you should be doing or when to switch. This can be overcome once you do the workout a couple of times and know what is coming up.No chaptering, so you can't just do abs, arms or butt part. Would recommend this dvd when the lil one is asleep and you know will be asleep for an hour or your lil one is more well behaved on their own.Also no cardio workout, so you're going to need to add cardio in order to blast the fat or you'll probably end up with great ab muscles but still not know it from the layer of fat on top. This is my first week at it, post baby, so we'll see what the results are......."
3,"bad video, good exercises","Overall, the workout is a good one. However, the video is awful. The sound is bad, the music is worse (it would be fine for a library but not for a workout), and she doesn't even attempt to explain what she is doing (i.e. the number of reps, or where you should feel an exercise, etc.). You have to watch the screen a lot in order to know when to switch sides or move on to the next exercise. I have definitely seen an improvement in my abs over the past month, but I would say it is weak on the other areas (arms, legs, back and butt). I memorized the video now (I took the time to count the amount of reps she does of each exercise) so I can just do it on my own with my own music and usually with my baby next to me."
3,Super hard,"I was really excited to start this video. When I received it I put it in the DVD to check it out...and I was out of breath just looking at her workout. I would consider this video to be Advanced. She does moves that I probably wouldn't be able to do a year post-paartum. I was really disappointed. I actually am doing other workouts and building up strength so that I can DO this video. So in my opinion, a little misleading."
4,Pretty Darn good!,I really liked doing this Video. I am pregnant..I only have 1 month left in my pregnancy. Obviously I am not suppose to be doing it but I modified it quite a bit. It was difficult. I am sure it will be perfect for post-pregnancy. I really love the way Tracey is in her video's. She is so cool..she doesn't talk very much but she has way more personality in this video in comparison to the 90 Day Video.
4,"A real workout, but no cardio","I just got this video after seeing Tracy on Oprah. I had my 2nd baby 5 months ago and am trying to get back to my pre-1st baby weight.Pluses:- Great encouraging tone and instruction- New ab, leg and arm exercised that I was not familiar with- Seems like it is going to be effective (since I could feel my muscles while doing it)- Classical music in the background rather than obnoxious techno or popWhat you need to know before purchasing:- You need 3 lb weights. (I did it without them, but Tracy uses them on and off in the video)- No cardio- The actual workout (including warm-up and cool-down) is around 50 minutes."
5,Not for Beginners but Works,"I have to first point out that this work out is really difficult. I am in pretty good shape and had a hard time finishing it during the first week, so if you are looking for a no brainer anyone can do it exercise program this one is probably not for you. That being said, I have been doing this workout for 2 weeks and I have already gone down a whole dress size. My stomach is starting to look flat again (something I thought was going to take a tummy tuck to happen). My favorite part is the arms. I am not a fan of bulky manlike arms and usually skip arm workouts. But Tracy has great unbulky feminine arms and I have given her arm workout a go and I love the results so far. Honestly this is the hardest workout I have ever done, but the results keep me motivated. Hopefully, I can stick with it:)"
4,post pregnancy workout,"The exercises are very effective in working the core abdominal muscels. There are so many ab routines I have never seen before. As Tracy promises doing these exercises several days a week will definitely help in getting the body back into shape after having a baby. The only down side is that someone who is not in great shape will not be able to do all the exercises initially. The workout is defenitely not beginners level, infact I would say it is expert level. It will take a lot of practice to do the full workout completely."
1,For women with babies?,"I got this towards the end of my second pregnancy. I have had two c-sections and definitely wanted to get back into shape. This DVD has low quality production. I agree with others who posted there isn't enough commentary so you are constantly staring at the tv in an ackward position. But the most annoying part, was the length! I have an infant and a toddler, which means I have no time and am sleep deprived! I ended up tossing this into the trash and bought Jillian Michaels and Jackie Warner workouts that are shorter and more intense."
3,"Challenging workout, but logistics suck","You should be warned - this is a CHALLENGING workout. I did yoga and swimming throughout my pregnancy, and still had trouble making it through this workout. It took me about 4 tries just to get through the ab routine. I say the logistics suck because the music is slow classical music, and there is no rhythm at all. She does not give a lot of verbal cues, so you have to really watch the TV which can be hard as you're working out. I love the challenge, it's just what I need after my second pregnancy but I really prefer workouts with more of a beat that I can follow."
3,Kind of boring,"I was looking for an ab workout DVD and came across this one. I was super excited to find a post pregnancy one ( I had my baby 7 weeks ago) Last week was finally the week that I got to try this DVD. I find that she does know what she is talking about but the DVD is rather boring. I put it on and follow it as best as I can but I find myself counting the seconds for it to finish. I don't think she is bad so please don't get me wrong. I just think I should be able to find an ab workout a little more upbeat. It really doesn't help me that I have to listen to ""elevator"" music all through out!"
2,Not good if you have separated abs(diastasis recti),"Ok, I'm gonna write a geniune review here today. I read and heard all good comments about this dvd so I bought it and tried it for 3 months but nothing happened to my protruding belly after two kids i got separation in my transverse abs so fix it first if you have this condition because I can't even explain it to you how frustrated I feel that I wasted all my 3 months doing this for 40 mins in hope ok give it time, give it time and give it time.... it might be good for those whose tranverse abs are already joined together. So, I'm going to try different excercises now like stability ball for abs and other transverse strengthining excercises now first and if they come close and I feel them hard together again who know when then I will think about giving this dvd a try...hmmm gosh so dissapointed!!"
5,kove love,"This video did magic on ny body after having twins, I'm still not 100% and had to add cardio in as well but a must when u start right after having a baby. Highly recommend"
1,What A Joke!,"I purchased this dvd after the birth of my daughter and with high review from a well known magazine. To my suprize, I found that herculese himself would have trouble performing all the moves in this video. I could barely make it halfway through a 40 min session that expects you to do over 100 different types of crunches and ""ab challenges""! There was also no cardio on the video like it implies. Not realistic at all. I was very disappointed and recommending this to a new mom would be an insult!"
2,Not great,This is not worth the $70 price tag. It's a decent ab workout but that's it- and it's grows boring very quickly.
3,good workout but..........,"I love the workout itself, but she tells you that ot get the full workout you have to do the cardo workout vidoe with along with the video and I assumed that a post pregnancy video would have all that I need to help me loose my baby weight. So I was a little disapopointed and I wont go and buy the cardo one becuase it's too exspensive to buy both."
5,great workout video,"I love this workout. Tracy does a great job of getting to those problem areas. The abs, butt and arms get a really great workout. I love it. It is really fun too because she is a dancer so you get to feel a bit like a ballerina!!"
3,A readable book.,"This is a readable book; the plot moves along nicely and most of the characters are realistic. However, Torie is irritating. This is the first book I've read in this series and there is no explanation as to why Torie dislikes her new stepfather, the sheriff. So her motivation for being snide, and sometimes downright nasty, toward him is puzzling. He acts in an adult and professional manner in contrast to her being impulsive and often childish. I'm not interested in feeling superior to characters in a book. I want to admire the protagonist and enjoy the time I spend with her. Others may find Torie feisty--she makes me tired.That being said, I might read the next book in the series just to see if Torie matures. And because Rett MacPherson is a good writer--why else would I find Torie so real?"
3,Only OK,"Recommended by Alton Brown, this is only OK. The cutter tends to go into the fluid. My simple traditional can opener seems to work better without getting the cutter blade into the can contents as often."
5,Great little gadget,"We bought one of these in a Nebraska Furniture Mart for my husband. He is a stroke survivor who has lost the use of this right hand but who still loves to cook. We have always used the ""traditional"" Swing-away can opener (which like most things in this world are designed for right handed use) and he had kind of adapted a multi-click style of use for it. He would repeated open & close it making LOTS of little cuts in can lids but he couldn't turn the handle. Now this gadget allows him to make so much more progress with its ratchet action - he just squeezes the handle and the gears turn the can. He completely wore that first one out and NFM is a long way from home, so we found this one on-line and he's back in business. It's a little noisy, but it is worth it for him to have some independence - plus he sometimes cooks dinner so I don't have to!"
3,One Handed -NOT,"A great idea that needs improvement. After arm surgery, I needed an opener that only needed one hand to operate. This opener requires ""assistance"" from the other hand, even if only to steady it and remove the lid."
2,Not what expected,"There's no pearl about this item. The picture is totally misleading, I wanted the headboard on the picture in shiny white, instead what I got was more like a dull white washed with wood streaks showing through. Very disappointed."
3,Not exactly white,"I realize images over the internet can appear different but, I was shocked when I opened the box. This headboard is not white.It's off white with grey streaks, it reminds me of white wall paneling. It doesn't match her white furniture. I thought the headboard had smooth routed edges but, they're very sharp and unrouted. There was no hardware to attach the headboard to the bedframe. It is slightly larger than daughter's twin bed. There was also a faint handprint on the headboard that won't clean off. Haven't decided if we're keeping this product."
3,It's okay,"It provided a nice and intense workout, but the narrator didn't really explain things too clearly. They also progressed through the moves at a very fast pace, so for a beginner, I thought it was kind of hard to follow. I had to stop and rewind the dvd quite a few times, to make sure I had picked up on things correctly.Overall, it was still pretty good.I'd definitely reccomend getting their second dvd instead. In that one, the narrator actually takes the time to explain how to do things and they tell you how many reps and when they switch legs or arms and what not."
5,The Perfect Ballet Workout,"I absolutely LOVE this workout. It's easy to adapt to your own fitness level, and with the special features of the DVD you can easily tailor a workout session that meets your specific needs and schedule. In just one week I noticed a great improvment in my strength, flexibility, and overall energy level. The relaxing music and easy pace make the workout a perfect stress reliever. And it's fun to do as well! I highly recommend The New York City Ballet Workout."
4,"Great for toning, stretching and flexibility","Once a upon a time, I was an avid dancer and ballet was a strong point for me. After not having danced in a few years but still managing to keep in shape, some parts of this DVD were pretty tough. The ab work is great and so are the stretches. Having been a personal trainer, I know the importance of stretching and these are great. The pace is good and you can change the music to be more contemporary so thats fun too. This DVD may not be good for someone who is into weights, but its certainly good for those who want to increase core strength, flexibility and overall toning."
1,For Ballet Dancers Only!,"This is not your typical workout video. Do not waste your money, unless you already know ballet. I took ballet for 4 years as a child, and I could not keep up. There is very little instruction, and the pace is rapid."
5,"great DVD, relaxing, challenging, and fun","I am 16 and a former dancer, i danced for 12 years. I loved this DVD, it was a challenging workout. I picked up the movements very easily, but for non-dancers it may be difficult. I would recommend this DVD for anyone who wants that lean dancer look, this will definately do it for you. It is so relaxing also, the setting is simple so there are no distractions. It's great!!"
2,"Book yes, Video NO","Having used the book for about a year, I was really excited when I heard the video was coming out. Sadly, I was bored. Worse, if you arent a dancer you wont be able to follow properly. 'Course, if the only encouragement you need to get fit is a bunch of beautiful bodies or are curious about the life of a ballet dancer (theres one little vignette about one of the prima ballerinas) - check it out"
4,Beautiful video,"This is fun if you always wanted be a ballerina but never had the chance. The set, the dancers and the music were beautiful. I am not sure why they decided to have Sarah Jessica Parker do the intro, it was pretty pointless. I recommend watching the video first and then trying the moves if you don't know ballet moves and lingo. This is fun if for a once in a while workout, I personally prefer Grace Lazenby's ""All the Right Moves- Yoga, Pilates and Dance Conditioning"" video for better results."
1,Forget the Halcyon.,"All you need is 5 minutes of this dvd and you'll be knocked out, it's so incredibly dull. Very serious and ponderous in tone and production. No pointers on form and injury prevention."
1,for experienced dancers only!,"i have a little dance background, so i at least recognize the terminology that is used in this dvd... on the rare occasion that any instruction is given. anybody who has never taken dance classes is going to have no idea if they're doing the exercises correctly. it's a pretty subdued workout, and you will find yourself getting tired by the time you get to the little jumps section, but as others have mentioned, you get very little verbal cuing, so you have to watch caraefully at all times to make sure the dancers haven't changed things up on you. which they often do. this would work for people accustomed to taking dance and just following the instructor; anyone looking for an instructional workout video, don't bother."
2,not what it appears,"maybe it was just me but it seemed that this video misleads people. the cover is appealing and it sounds great to be toned without becoming bulky. unfortunately, the video itself is extremely boring and hard to follow. there's no excitement to get you motivated, only a plain white room and a narrator with a voice that could put you to sleep in a minute. i also found it very hard to do and i felt like an idiot prancing around not one bit as graceful as the dancers.it goes on forever and i can never seem to finish. i only give it two stars because it is not the video's fault that i am not coordinated enough."
3,"fun, but not much of a workout","This video workout is a lot of fun, and a lot of laughs if you have never taken ballet before. I really like doing it, however, I do not think that it is that hard of a workout. At the end of it, I am not even remotely tired or sore, but maybe that is because I am used to doing Tae-Bo every day. However, it is very relaxing and the music to the workouts is very calming. It definitely brings me down from a hard day at school, but as for it toning my body, that is yet to be seen (or felt). I guess I am the kind of person who needs to feel the pain in order to feel like I am doing anything worthwhile for my body."
1,What a waste of money!,"I purchased this dvd, thinking it would be a workout, combined with ballet movements. It does have ballet movements, but there is very little workout. I could burn more calories sitting on the couch. I found it to be very boring, unless you don't mind standing and lifting your leg 20-30 times, and doing it again. I thought there would be more hopping and leaping and whatever else ballet dancers do, but it was mostly stepping and lifting. For an hour worth of working out, I didn't even break into heavy breathing, much less a sweat. Don't buy this, it is a waste of time.One good point about it. The abdominal section is great! I use this section after my regular video workout (which is not this video), and do it two to three times in a row, it has good moves to help flatten the stomach, by doing a few times."
2,Don't Expect Any Dancing,"I bought this video because I wanted a fun, new way to get in shape. I have also taken ballet forever and thought I might learn something from the pros. Nope. There is one tiny dance section (if you can call it that), and the rest is the dancers going through very slow, very boring stretches. I did not break a sweat or even have tired muscles afterward. The only thing I really liked about this video were the dancer profiles at the end, but I didn't buy this tape to see the E! True Hollywood Stories."
4,Great strength and stretches for legs & bottom,"A good video that really emphasizes legs, abs and buttock! Arm work is light though.I took ballet as a child and was intrigued to try again as an adult. Not much dancing, but you will see plies,tendu,and balances! If you know any ballet-you will love this( re-live the dream of being a dancer).If you don't know any dance terms/steps, you can still do this video as the dancers provide a good model of the motions (there are both female and male dancers!). My son thought this was silly until he tried some of the exercises and exclaimed-""WOW, this was harder than I thought!""."
4,Good workout,"It's a very good workout, especially the abs and legs section EXCELLENT workout, good cool down. The only problem with this video is the warm up segment. If you have no ballet experience or the don't know the basics, the warm up is confusing. The guidance disappears somewhere between and you're supposed to follow what the dancers are doing."
3,Experience helpful,This is actually more of a 3 and a half star rating not just a 3. I like the tone of the video and the dancers were so graceful I found them very inspiring. It's a very nice change from the super perky nearly annoying exercise videos hosts. I thought the music was a little loud and drowned out some of the instructions. I have studied ballet before it has been a while so I don't remember all the positions and moves and I found the lack of explanation frustrating as some moves are easy to pick while others had me a little confused at first. It would have been helpful if they had explained the positions and techniques of certain moves. I don't think this is a good DVD for someone who wants to learn ballet on their own but has some experience with it already. Perhaps a good video to do if you're in a class and want something to practice with between classes.
4,Simply Watch the Video First,Most of the complaints are about not being able to following along with the dancers. If you are not familiar with ballet simply watch the video first. of course of you watch it for the first time while trying to do it you will not be able to follow along. To point something else out. this is a Ballet Video not a kickboxing video. The narrators voice is soothing there would be no need for him to be shouting while you are trying to do ballet. I will say that there is no need to buy he second version of this CD because they both have the exact same content. This video has the best stretching exercise that I have ever done. I do the warm up on this video then do other videos in My collection. if you are looking to add variety to you workout this is a great video to add to your collection.
4,NYCB Workout - great DVD!,"This is a great DVD! It's great if you need some additional technique work at home or if you just want to stay in shape. I would recommend that first time dancers take a beginner ballet class before trying this workout though, because you may not be able to follow everything and be able to do it correctly. I use it when I have a break from classes or if I need some good stretching. The music is great and I do enjoy the workout!"
5,my favorite,"This video is wonderful! You do not need to know anything about ballet to do it. It takes a little time to catch on, but not more than any video. Once you get the warm-ups down the rest is easy. The second half of this video is MUCH more challenging. I usually only do the firs half, but it has a perfect place to stop right in the middle. So in a half an hour, I feel wonderfly stretched and relaxed, my posture is improved, and i'm ready to take on the day. Also, the music and narration are very plesant. I highly recomend this for anyone!"
2,not for everyone,i've been a dancer on and off for sixteen years and i cannot do this workout. the narrator talks too fast and does not explain anything. my ballet ignorant friends gave up after the first warm up. only buy this if you study ballet and have been studying ballet for years.
4,A nice workout if you already like ballet,"I bought this video because there isn't an adult beginner ballet class anywhere to be found. I've always enjoyed ballet moves, but felt overwhelmed or intimidated in the classes. I'm in decent shape, and didn't find this workout very strenuous, so I use ankle weights for some parts. You have to do it a few times to get into a groove. The level of work/intensity is entirely up to you, and it's difficult to work hard until you're familiar with the moves. You have to watch closely, as there is very little direction on the audio and no instruction on the foundation of the moves. If you need a change from the usual workout videos, and always wanted to be a ballet dancer safely in the privacy of your home, this is a great video."
4,beautiful,"a big plus for me is the exercises are in short segments, so that i don't get bored or fatigued for a certain area. however, for people who like to target a specific muscle group, ea segment may not be long enough. another big plus is the beautiful music, which is rare for workout videos. an hour just flies.the only flaw is the cuing is a bit off & there's no instructions. this is no problem for me since since i've taken ballet. but it may be a problem for a novice.i also enjoy the interviews at the end."
3,Not very coherent,"After fifteen years of ballet, I took a 'break' in college and admittedly lost lots of technique. I thought this video might be fun and I was intrigued by the book as well. However, I was disappointed by the disjointed way that segments were combined and movements were introduced. It seemed too advanced for someone with no prior knowledge of the technique and terminology and lacked the fluidity of dance class. It also irked me that the narration and the dancers were not synchronized. At some point I just gave up and started moving to the music, which worked just fine. However, if you want a good workout, you cannot beat floor barre - we used to dread that part of class. Also, I found the abs section suitably challenging. While not pleased with the video as a whole, I would recommend parsing it up and using only the parts that are right for you."
4,A Great Workout for a Ballet lover,"This was a great workout for me. I love ballet and have had 6 lessons but live in a small rural town and can no longer attend lessons. This allows me to practise my ballet and tone up at the same time.I have been using this workout for two and a half weeks now and have lost 3 kgs and 1 inch off my bust, waist, tummy and hips. From a dancer's perspective, I have also increased my flexibility and turnout.I really enjoy doing this low impact workout so much that there's no problems doing it every day (or second day)"
2,"New York City Ballet Workout-- Nice to watch, HARD to do.",I bought this video because I enjoying many forms of dancing and thought that this would be a video I would look forward to popping in everyday. I have some background knowledge in ballet. I found this video very difficult to keep up with because their is absolutely no instruction as to how to do the steps that they are doing. I would probably have to watch the tape over and over in order to pick up these moves. It's a great informational video on the New York City Ballet dancers but I wouldn't waste your money if you're looking for a good workout (unless you're very experienced in ballet...and I mean VERY EXPERIENCED.)
2,okay but not great,"okay, i just bought this and the secong workoutit was okay i guess. i mean, the steps are really easy and the workout is not tiring at all. i do not really consider it a workout but i guess if you just want to tuch-up on some basic stuff then it is a good video. but i being an advanced dancer at the age of 13 (a pre-proffesional) think it was a waste of time /money. it would be grteat for beginners though. that is all i have to say. hope that this review helps you. (oh yeah, my favorite part was the interviews and bonus features at the end of the DVD)"
1,"Hate it, Hate it, Hate it, Hate it.","As an athlete that many acquaintences consider ""hardcore,"" I deeply hated this tape. Unless you have been a professional ballet dancer your entire life, there is no way you would know how to do any of these moves. There is no instruction anywhere on the tape. If you want to watch 75-pound adults sway their arms for half an hour, this is for you. If you want a workout, stay as far away from this tape as you possibly can. This is the biggest waste of money I have ever seen in my life."
3,Update: New York Sports Club version,"UPDATE on 9/7/01 - NEW YORK SPORTS CLUB VERSION BETTER:The quality of the NEW YORK CITY BALLET WORKOUT at NEW YORK SPORTS CLUBS in NYC has taken a nosedive. Only one of the instructors I mentioned is teaching and all the others I have taken with around the city are not worth a repeat visit. It was once such an incredible workout, but without the right instructors it is very lame! Bring back Rebecca Mesker and Stas Kmec(the best)and more quality instructors!"
1,I want my money back too!!,"I completly agree with Victoria M. Pond from Seattle, there is no barre at all! But I have to say the video is really nice; nice dancers, nice music, nice prodcution. I think, maybe, it is good for beginers, althoug theres a lot of center, quit dificult for beginers.Can some body recomend a very good ballet work out? Is there some kind of forum about this subjetc?"
3,Ballet in the Big Apple,"Shots of a N.Y. tugboat spraying water into the air, pictures of people crowding N.Y. streets. These are the scenes that act as a filler in the New York City Ballet's workout video and DVD. In between all the ballet hype about the ballet stars' busy lives, we are given some basic Pilates moves and some quick ballet stretches and jumps. I agree with another reviewer that there are NOT enough repetitions to do much to work the body. Everything is done to quickly, as if you are caught up in the hectic pace of New York City. Having taken adult ballet classes with the Houston Ballet for 5 years, I was let down by this video. While I think that New York City Ballet is one of the best in the world, their video is a rip-off. Instead, spend your money on the Kultur video called, ""The Ballet Workout"" with Melissa Lowe. It is a much better investment."
1,You Want A Choppy Workout?,"If you want a workout that stops and starts and stops and starts, then you should get this one via DVD. Your fingers get a GREAT workout because you have to continually hit the play button, even though the instructions say you can hit the ""Workout"" mode and you will be able to continue going through the program. That doesn't happen for me. I get to sit through all the introductions and credits while my heart rate drops, and then see the first warm up, and then have it go back to the main menu. Perhaps it's a defective DVD. I'll never know, though, because Amazon does not let buyers return open DVDs."
2,Snoredom,"Being on a pilates kick, I was hoping to find more strengthening exercises to lengthen the muscle and, naturally, stumbled upon this ballet workout. However, to routinely follow any exercise video, you need an instructor who motivates and keeps the audience interested.This video was neither motivating nor interesting. The commentary was bland at best, with a monotonous European accent coldly instructing the movements. The dancers who performed the exercises to the cold voice of Big Brother were empty moving parts. It was a bore to watch and a bore to follow.That being said, the exercises probably do work if the video and the exercises are followed faithfully, but are unlikely to give any visual results anytime soon. With the sheer boredom and unpleasantness in following the video, it makes practicing a pain with the most likely result being that the video will be another dusty addition to the bookcase."
1,Would make a great coaster.,"Thank god for the library. I was excited when I came across this tape at the library. I took dance classes as a child and have lots of rhythm. None of that mattered with this tape.There are too many gaps, so the 'workout' doesn't seem consistent. The narrator is horrific. It's impossible to follow his instructions. If you follow him, and look up, you realize that the dancers are doing something totally different.Do not waste your time on this tape unless you are a prima ballerina who can't get enough.Otherwise, use it to balance out an old table."
3,Nothing amazing...,"Use this tape as a supplement to your regular workout or if you don't want a really difficult workout that day. Maybe because I don't have a ballet background, I don't sweat much doing it. However, one of my fiends who has taken extensive ballet loves this tape, and believes you need to know the classic ballet positions to get the most out of this workout."
3,New York Sports Club version better,"I have taken the NEW YORK CITY BALLET WORKOUT as offered at NEW YORK SPORTS CLUBS in NYC with some incredible instructors and it is not as tame as the one depicted in this video.This version gave me a healthy glow, but not the drenching sweat I get from an actual instructor. The cueing and lack of it makes it it more difficult to follow. The pace is a bit gentler than the repetitive high repetition version of an actual class. Only a ""technique"" class was depicted in this video.The ""movement"" classes ( hard to do in one's living room)are very aerobic and once the warm up stretch is completed it is non-stop movement. The best instructors are Stas Kmec, Rebecca Mesker and Peter Frame. The others pale in comparison. Visit NYC and take the real NEW YORK CITY BALLET WORKOUT!"
2,Not great,While the dancers are lovely to look at this in not a workout tape. Lots and lots of slow stretching but no cardio at all. If you are looking for heart pumping excercise this tape is way too mellow. For a better challenge just take a ballet class or look for other low impact aerobics. My tape was donated to Good Will.
5,Get Ready For A Workout!,"You might not think this is much of a workout, but just wait till the next day! You'll feel it then! You can burn calories, get your heart rate up, and firm up. If you enjoy ballet, get this one. Beautiful classical music goes along with this one. Just looking at the dancers can give you inspiration."
1,Want to return this,"I have purchased several excersice videos [...], and this is the least favorite. I have taken ballet lessons, and learned the basics, yet stillI find instructions of this tape not informative enough. It tells what to do, but no specific explanation on how to do them right. It is in black and white, and very two dimentional. There's no encouragement, either. If you like ballet as I do, I'd assume you want to see the dancers in their most beautiful costumes and moves, right? If so, I don't recommend this. Instead I highly recommend Jennifer Kries's Pilates Target specifics. It is not ballet tape, but in one of four sections for thighs she uses ballet and she gives great instructions, encouragement, collors, and three-dimentional views."
3,Not Ballet for Beginnners,"I agree with the online reviewer C. Makulinski from Toledo, OH. I wish I had heeded her advice. I am a lifelong fan of ballet, especially the New York City Ballet and thought this workout would be just what i needed as i was looking for something to balance yoga classes with. I had taken adult ballet classes just two years ago in college but was not prepared for how much actual background you need to follow many of the excercises. Poor editing left me confused while watching as to whose right or left I should be following. Unfortunately, I was left by the end, on my couch, watching and admiring these limber dancers. Realized how rusty I am. This is a beautiful and effective workout but not for those with limited or no ballet technique. You do need to know the difference between a plie and degage."
5,True Talents,"There is no phase of this video that comes up as ""mediocre"".. From the ballet workouts to the unexpected portion [ the ballet dancers discussing why they chose this ""art' as their profession(s)]."
4,Beautiful.,"I enjoyed the workout very much. It's tastefully done.The dancers are exquisite. The music is beautiful.Over all, it's a very enjoyable workout for me."
2,Needs More Instruction,"I wish I had come to Amazon.com to read a review before I bought this in a bookstore. This video is very well done from an artisitic standpoint, but for someone who knows NOTHING about ballet this is NOT the video for you. I agree with another reviewer in that there are almost no verbal cues whatsoever. There are almost no mentions of how to breath, how to do most of the poses and how to avoid doing them incorrectly, which is half the battle with these sorts of exercise programs. I have never taken ballet before and I found myself quite lost and frustrated watching this DVD. I do think that if you have taken ballet before this would be a good purchase though. Definitely not for a beginner."
3,"Good WARM-UP, not workout","There is almost too much space between ""workout"" segments--you're not working hard enough to need a break between segments. Does provide a great stretch and some challenging leg toning exercise. Great photography (except for when they occasionaly cut off the dancers' feet). Great music if you enjoy classical style."
1,"terrible, defective","if you can get past the technical difficulties, it might be a good workout. the first time i put it on, just to watch, it ran straight through, although with pauses between sections. when i was ready to actually do the workout, it went to ""video diaries"" after workout 1. i stopped and started again, this time by choosing the section i wanted. after going through that particular section, it jumped to one of the last sections. not in chronological order. so i stopped and started it again. after the first section, it went back to the main menu. what a disappointment."
3,Useful DVD between ballet classes,"I like to get into danced-based workouts, which is why I got bought this DVD. Don't expect to turn into a ballerina with this workout alone, but using this to supplement ballet classes provides an opportunity to practice technique when you can't afford daily ballet lessons. I definitely prefer the NYC Ballet Workout 2 video over this one since that DVD contains a choreographed segment at the end, but this DVD is good enough to alternate with a ballet class or two each week."
2,Too plain and simple! (It's for beginners),"According to the former feedbacks, I thought this DVD should be challenging or interesting. However,I was disappointed by not learning anything new and inspiring. Also, I disliked the dumbness of the dancers. It's more like a gym class than a ballet instruction."
2,Not worth it...,"I bought this DVD when it first came out and have only done it about twice. If you looking to lose weight or tone up this one won't do it. Its slow. While it looks good, and may be fun to do occasionally, its not worth the money. Invest in Tamilee Webb's ""I want those"" DVD."
2,disappointing,I had expected an actual ballet barre workout---the technique was lacking the cueing did not match the action.the photography was beautiful! The bodies of the dancers were inspiring!
2,Not for me,"I was very disappointed with this video--perhaps if I had some background in ballet I would have had different expectations. I was looking for a different type of workout which it certainly is. However, I realized at about the 13th section that IT WASN'T FUN!!! Here are professional dancers holding perfect positions that I will NEVER come close to. I enjoy working out and have lots of work-out videos that I love--and many that I had to do several times before I really felt comfortable with them. I didn't even finish the whole workout--it was more like art than exercise. Watching perfection is one thing--it is beautiful--but it was not at all motivating."
3,"Good for stretching & ab work, but not a ""workout""","I was hoping this dvd would be more like a real ballet class, but it's just too easy. I agree with the other reviewers about the poor cueing - while I was doing the floor exercises, I had no idea when I was supposed to stop and go to the other leg. The best part about this workout is the ab work - good and tough! This workout is well-produced and the music is great, but I wish the content were better. For a well-rounded, challenging cardio, strength, and fun dance ballet workout, try Balletbootcamp (I bought mine from Collage Video)."
2,A Little Guidance?,"I haven't been able to make it past the first section of this dvd. There is no instruction, so I spend more time craning my neck trying to see what is going on (especially when doing stretches on the floor) than I do working out. I get so frustrated and uncomfortable by the end of the stretching section that I have lost interest. I wouldn't recommend this--do pilates or yoga for muscular strength and stretch toning, and something more guided for cardio. Otherwise you'll just be randomly jumping around your living room, like I am."
2,Nice video not good workout,"I did ballet for 7 years, I am familiar with the movements and this video is not really a workout video, you do it and unless you are completely out of shape, you won't feel/see any difference. The video is nice to watch, the dancers are in extremely good shape (yes! envy!) but they didn't get those muscles by doing JUST this video!! Come on! If you want a good workout look somewhere else."
2,overrated... skip it!,"I bought this video when enrolled in weekly exercise-ballet classes the the local club. i found this video to move way too slowly between the exercises, and too ""markety"" in how it presents them all. i was constantly fast forwarding to get to the next one. and each exercise itself it not repeated enough to be useful... far too many moves with too much time between them. overall, just not very useful or helpful."
2,"Nice visuals, poor instructions","The video is aesthetically stunning, but the workout itself is fragmented and difficult to follow, due to the poor instructions. Some segments are ""only for ballet dancers"". Not for newbies."
3,Decent supplemental workout,"This DVD won't take any pounds off, but if you use it in conjunction with your regular workout it's a good diversion. The dancers are great to look at, and the voiceover will remind you of those record player barre exercises when you were a kid. The workout is not taxing, but it certainly reminds me of muscles I don't work out regularly enough. I always feel my outer thighs the next day. This is worth adding to your collection."
2,"very difficult to follow, poor instruction","as ex dancers, my wife and i were hoping this video would be as much fun as our old dance classes, but the instructors were bland and difficult to follow. It was not smooth and graceful, and the pilates refeernces seem unfounded. We did not like it and think it only sells beacuse of the name. Try somehting else instead."
2,A shame but a miss,"The dancers are beautiful, the voice cueing bites, slthough the moves get easier after a couple of viewings. But ""a couple of viewings"" is as far as I got. The wait between exercises is so very irritating. To keep things moving, I have to grab the remote and fast forward. And that breaks the flow too much -- every time I approach cardio workout level, there's that disjointed pause and boom, the heart rate drops. I didn't buy the video to look at dancers, but for a workout, and there it fails."
4,Like it!,"I will start my review saying I understand the 1 star comments. It's worth reading them.My purpose of buying this video was to find exercices dancers do to work/muscle their legs (especially). And I have found what I wanted.I will probably write down the exercises and do my own warm up and work out selection everyday.Indeed, the full workout is long to do everyday. Another true comment was that you shall not ""loose"" your time trying to execute the combinations if you are a ballet student starter (as I am). I felt frustrated already just looking at the combos at first time :-/I will probably buy the book as comments say it is even better than the video!Anyway I think this video is worth it!"
4,New York Ballet Workout,"Fun video, the lighting is a bit dark so it makes it a little hard to see the dancers, but you really feel like you've had a good workout when your done, it targets all the little muscles to help you control your movements better."
3,"NYC Ballet ""Instruction"" Not Workout","The DVD is good in that it shows you close-ups of the movements so you can see the proper techniques, placement of feet, arms, etc. However, this DVD is an instructional DVD and calling this DVD a ""workout"" is misleading. In order for it to be a workout, each of the sections would have to be longer, much longer. The music is great and fits in really well with each movement. Watch this DVD and learn how the movements should be properly done, then do them separately for a longer period of time on your own."
1,Why pay so much more???,"this item is way overpriced. it is available in the local grocery or discount stores for much less. good product, bad price."
3,Small = Regular,I am so used to double and triple rolls. These seem small and need to replace them often. Did not notice if amazon sells double or triple roll. Maybe consider the number of sheets to price when looking at this vs other products.
2,shipping,be aware that shipping was too expensive for the value of the prouct. I end up paying more for this than if I bought each roll separately in a supermarket
2,"What happened to the quality? Smelly, Crummy towels now!",I thought someone did a bait-and-switch until I noticed that the pattern on the plastic wrapping and the pattern on the towel match. I bought a 15-roll bundle of these at a big box store last month. Now I'm practically throwing them directly in the garbage pail just to rid myself of the smelly things (sweet creosote?). The towel used to be fairly soft and plush. Now the two thin layers will hardly separate. I examined a roll from my car trunk that is at least 8 years old and then examined the new roll. I'm not imagining things. The new rolls have a much coarser pattern and are just plain crummy.
1,Poor Quality,"I bought Bounty Paper Towels for 20 years, and used it all my adult life. Today I'm looking for a new brand of paper towels because the quality of this product has gone down the hill. The rolls are loosely rolled, the paper itself got so thin and flimsy that there is no difference between Bounty or a dollar store discount brands any longer. Bounty might be trying to make more money, but all they are doing is loosing old time, loyal customers like me."
3,Good Stuff....,"Good stuff, won't purchase online again, but will purchase at local store. Way too expensive."
2,Paper towels are a rip-off,"I am fed up with buying paper towels. I am switching to cloth, which works better, ends up paying for itself, and is easier on the environment."
3,Paper Towel,I do not think Bounty is as absorbent as Viva paper towels.Cost the same and isn't as good as a product.
1,Did not absorb my spill,"I spilled liquid and needed like 2 rolls of this rubbish to pick it up. I felt so bad about this crappy product, I went and planted a tree afterwards."
5,It's so good!,"We purchased this product in Kauai, HI while on vacation and it is absolutely fantastic. I find myself wishing we had bought a few bottles to bring home!"
1,"Great idea, but poor construction, poor design.","When I took this out of the box my first reaction was that it felt cheap to me. This is a great idea, but is poorly constructed.It is made of ordinary plastic and the moving parts were extremely difficult to use and over time felt like they would fail and break off.When trying to open the battery door, the latches were clumsy and difficult. I removed the AA battery holder - replacing required an extra pair of hands to maneuver the latches.I returned this immediately without using. I decided it would be easier and more effective to just carry an extra D70 battery in my pocket. I will wait until Nikon makes something similar to this."
2,Not a good product,"I bought one from 47th photo & had to return for another one. It was defective. The replaced one is the same. The AA batteries does not work with the unit. It is cheap, poor plasstic quality built. Lousy design, try to take the battery out in a hurry !! You will break the hinge ... This unit is the same as the Hoodman. They are all made in the same factory, unfortnately. Do not buy this battery grip !! You will regret."
4,Passes the test...,Considering that I did not purchase this item for my personal use and for a friend has proven to be a good choice. The individual is very happy with the item since this was his second choice and meets their need.
3,D70s Optek Grip/Battery Pack,"Good as a vertical grip, but vertical shutter release needs some work and extra battery compartment allows for long shooting sessions."
1,Not very pleased with the item.,Not very pleased with it. The vertival trigger does NOT work. Followed the instructions but the vertical trigger does NOT work. Have been unable to contact the vendor.
2,don't buy it,"i was very disappointed. It is a very generic product. My friend has a canon battery grip and it integrates perfectly...no outside wire hanging out, or any other weird thing i have to glue to the outside of my camera. Plus all the dials needed are also on the battery grip. The opteka is basically an $80 battery compartment. save your money and buy an extra battery!"
2,A little disappointed!!,"The Opteka Battery Pack Grip for the Nikon D70 & D70s did not live up to the quality that I was expecting. I was disappointed in the very plastic feel to the interior battery tray. The locking mechanism of the battery compartment did not lock with a very assuring solid ""click"". Once in, the battery tray had too much movement in my opinion. I guess I'm just too use to the quality that comes with every Nikon item I owe. Don't understand why Nikon never made a battery motor drive for the D70 & D70s!!"
1,Get Cherry Lips Part 1,This CD is a waste of money. I am A big garbage fan and I bought Cherry Lips 1 and 2. Part One includes Use Me (a good bside!) and the video. Part two was the same thing except a different bside and a remix that sounds the same. GET PART ONE!
5,Great Atlas for Kids!,"As a upcoming teacher and lover of geography, I just had to buy this book! My decision was made much easier since it was on sale at a local bookstore for only $3.50!"
1,NOT HAPPY!,It's been over a month and I still didn't get my CD...Not pleased at all. I will think twice before ordering something else from here.
5,This well put together album has really inspired my life.,"O'landa Draper and the associates is a wonderful and annointed group that has really been a blessing to my life. When I think of the words to some of the songs that he writes, it really encourages me.Reflections, Give it up, Got a feeling, Make a Joyful Noise, and Throw Out the Life Line are just a few of his many songs. O'landa Draper and the associates are just wonderful,powerful,and annointed people who do not mind praising God. I would just like to say,""Thanks for the great contribution that you put in to inspire the lives of many people.""Sincerely yours, Sharonda K.Walker"
5,Does the job for a reasonable price,"This LED rear bicycle light is bright, includes static and blinking modes, and is easy to install. It would be very challenging for a vehicle to not visualize me on the road at night. As an added bonus, the price is quite reasonable."
3,Its ok but check your seat post first,"Nice and bright, different flash settings, great visibility, mounting needs a little improvement. If there's one piece of advice I can give is check your seat-post before using this light. The seat-post is the ideal spot for placing this since you want the flashing to be as high as possible. Unfortunately my Raleigh SC40 has a seat shock post which is far too wide to use the mounting :( The rear forks also do not accomodate the mounting so there are precious few places this can be done. Unfurtunately, this means my flashing light is relegated to operate from a plastic bag dangling from my seat :("
2,can't withstand vibration and shock...,"While riding in a Critical Mass event, I hit a small bump on the street and the jolt sensation was mild, but apparently enough to cause this light to unclip itself and fall off. I was unable to retrieve it as the situation could get dangerous with so many cyclists involved in the event.I bought a second one of the same make and model, but this time I'm adding a fix to the flaw....electrical tape to further secure it."
2,Can't install batteries = useless,I can't even figure out how to get this thing open to install the batteries. I don't like it - it's not very user friendly.
4,Works well.,Really love this. It works well on my bike. I mounted it below and snug up against the reflector so it has to be removed with a tool. If not you can just easily unhook and take it with you or clip on clothing. Mounting directly below an obstacle reduces theft and I don't have to think about it.
4,Works good,My only complaint is I take my bike seat off in which this product is attached to when I ride my bike at the gym and in my gym bag if the reflector isn't placed correctly the light will come on accidentally.
4,Rear Bike Light,It's my 1st starter bike light. I lost it though and I have to buy a new one because if fell off. I guess I'll buy this one again!
5,Safety!,I don't bike at night but I do bike early in the morning and I feel like this blinking light absolutely catches people's attention. For the price I simply couldn't pass it up. Why take any unnecessary risks with so many distracted drivers these days?
1,Sorry but had to replace it,"Was very frustrated trying to figure out assembly and installation of batteries.... no directions came with it. Also, mine was defective so contacted Amazon's excellent customer support, and they credited my account without returning it. I bought the Portland Design Works Danger Zone taillight and glad that I spent the extra $20 as it works fantastic."
5,Best rear light under 10 bucks.,"This is the best rear bicycle light under $10. The battery life lasts forever. It also uses AAA batteries and not some weird size battery that costs 5 bucks at Walgreens. It's waterproof and has 3 mounting options; clip, seat post, or the rear strut. It's bright, and you'll be seen from blocks away. Hands down you wouldn't need to pay more for a rear light. I Highly recommend this product."
5,Works without a charm!,"Works as advertised. If you're looking for something that alerts drivers to your presence, this is it! Very easy installation."
3,Bright LED's when viewed straight on-No so much from side.,This light can be seen from quite a distance from the rear with the bright LED's. Wish it had better visibility from the side.
4,Great light,"Good quality and very bright, does what it should. Only reason I didn't give it five stars is that the seatpost mount could have used a little more thought on their part - and I noticed a couple other reviews mentioned this. The problem is, for a standard MTB seatpost using the larger rubber spacer, there's a small gap between two collars on the plastic clamp when it's clamped tight, causing the light bracket to slip down a notch when you hit bumps. I slipped a metal washer in between, with the collar screw going through it, and it cinched up nice and tight against the washer - problem solved. Overall a great light though."
4,works as advertised,"mounted below seat, highly visible, can also be mounted on belt behind your back. Really like the blinker setting, since bicycle riders are nearly invisible to American drivers, I think the blinking feature garners more attention. Nice product at reasonable price"
5,Simple and easy-to-use,"I got this blinker as I often bike late at night and want to be safe (and visible) on the road. I have been using it for more than a month now and am happy with the product so far. Like other reviewers, I don't like that its battery case is inside the red cover and am apprehensive that I may end up breaking it sometime...Also, I hope that the light holder does not give way after extended use."
5,Provides big visibility at a small price,"Easy to install, this shiny, bright LED light will make sure (usually) that motorists see you! Is easy to turn on while riding with the simple push of a button. Pushing the button again activates the ""blinking"" mode...sure to mesmerize anyone. I recommend NOT looking at it while installing the battery. I saw three little dots for about 10 minutes! Pushing the button a third time shuts off the light."
4,Great Light.,If you do any night riding or low light riding then you must get this! It has a steady or flashing red light to make you highly visible from the rear. It definitely makes you feel safer knowing you can be seen in low visibility conditions or at night. Has a little push button on the rear to change settings or turn off. Easy to install and operate. Only complaint is to put batteries in you must effectively take it apart..be careful not to break anything during this process.
5,"Cheap, reliable and lasting","I have moved to three different countries in the last 4 years, every time I bought a bike and the accessories to go with it (yes I could have kept the lights but it seems overcrowding at the time..50 pounds per luggage you know!)I always buy this one, it's cheap, very reliable and it lasts a long time. I always use it in Flashing mode (I believe it has 2 or 3 modes, one being solid the other flashing and the 3rd...I can't remember) so it saves the battery I guess but I use my bike everyday and don't need to replace the battery often.Visibility is good and that's what matters."
5,Saving lives or trying to,love it since I got it because you can never be too careful with the crazy drivers out there on the road. if you ride a bike I would too just invested in something like this.
3,Not great for a carbon fiber bike fram,"The light itself works great, and I have no complaints there. I have a carbon fiber bike, however, and the seat post is not round but more of an oval shape. There was no way to make the light fit on the seat post, so I will have to buy a different product."
4,"good, simple light","This light is simple, durable, and it runs on AAA batteries. I like that it comes with a seatstay mount (very useful on a commuter with a rack) and that is has a clip. I just snaped it to the back of my saddle bag and that was it. If I wear a backpack or ride a different bike I can just clip it to whatever and go. Very bright too. No need for anything more in a tail light."
3,Being seen is great,"This item, I didn't even know I had ordered until I got the email confirmation. I tried to delete the order; but it was too late and not worth the time to send it back once I got it. So I used it and it works very well on my bike. I do a lot of early morning riding and this time of year it is dark. I have plenty of blinkers on my bike. I added this one just because I had it. It works just fine."
3,Blink 3,"It is not bad for the price, easy to install, but I did not find the third blinking function."
4,Good one,I liked the clip that they have provided.; you can hang it behind your helmet. The LEDs are very bright
5,Great light,"I've been through many bike tail lights, and this is probably the best I've used. Living in Manhattan, I am careful to remove my light when I park the bike on the street. This has the easiest, sturdiest release latch I've used. Others I've tried are either tough to get off, or feel flimsy enough to break with constant removal and reattachement."
4,Great light,"Great light - bright, adjustable angle, good size, blinky-ness - cars are (thankfully) passing me with a more room between us; I should have had a rear taillight earlier, glad I picked this one up (that it was on sale didn't hurt)"
5,Great brake light. Works well and bright,Not too much else to say other than great light. Easy to install and bright. Would buy again. plastic mount but works well. The two rubber inserts are nice for mounting on different size seat tubes.
4,Great Product for the Price but no instruction manual.,"This product came with batteries to put inbut didn't include any instruction on how to change the battery.So I googled it and found Planet Bike's instructional video on their Youtube.[...]Great light for the price, bright enough to blind people's eyes."
4,Great value for the money,"For the money, works well, and as others have stated, batteries last long due to the use of LEDS. Small, so you can take it anywhere, and clip to your clothing or back pack when walking, biking or hiking, etc. Wish I could find an inexpensive bike light for the handlebars, so I generally use my Petzl."
3,Falls off easily,"It falls off the bike so easily. When I attach it to my the end of my bike rack it seems secure enough. I then took it outside for a test ride and it fell off when I road over a couple of bumps. I figure that when I ride over bumps the light whips around, gets unlock and then comes flying off the bike. To stabilize it, I attach it the the back wheels bracket, resting it on the frame.To open Blinky I use a coin. It takes 2 AAA batteries and is very bright.ProsBrightLight weightInexpensiveConsNo very secureFalls off easily"
5,"Other than a lack of instructions, awesome light.","So you might be thinking, ""what instructions could a simple light need."" However, getting access to the battery compartment was like getting Iran and Israel to throw a dinner party together (maybe not that bad). A quick google search revealed a very helpful youtube video that showed how to do it. The existence of this video made me feel good as I obviously wasn't the only one who had trouble opening it. Once you watch it is a eureka moment. Beyond that, the product is as advertised.Pros: Very reasonable price; Could save your life; respected bicycle company (that donates a large percentage of profits towards bicycle advocacy); kind of funky to see when someone is riding it.Cons: Write one paragraph to describe how to access the batteries.I definitely recommend this product and give it my stamp of approval."
4,Very Bright and Visible Rear Light - Rack Mount Hardware Sold Seperatly,"The 3-led Planet Light rear blinky is very bright and has two operating modes - always on and flashing. While the included hardware has a clip-on attachment, than can be used to attach the light to a rear rack or bag (which also allows for easy removal), I would suggest purchasing thePlanet Bike Tail Light Rack Bracketif you plan on attaching the light to a rear rack. I lost the first one I ordered due to just clipping it on and it vibrated off the rack. The rack bracket that is sold separately, allows for a permanent and sturdy installation that let's you adjust the light to the right angle and keeps the light from wobbling around on the rack. Alternatively, you could also purchase thePlanet Bike 3018-1 Rack Blinky 5- 5 LED Tail Light with Rack Mount and Batteriesthat comes with the rack hardware included."
1,Great light horrible bracket!,So I bought this due to the price and great reviews. The light its self is great. Very bright and seems of good quality. The bracket is what sinks the product. I just couldn't get it to fit snugly any where in my bike. Finally it seemed to be securley fastened to my rear rack bars. Went for a ride got home and guess what? It fell off! I'm now going to try and get a refund from the seller without having physical possession of most of the item. Wish me luck!
5,"Great price and functionality, how can you go wrong?","I love this light! I've used it on my Trek 6500 for several months now, and it works great.Battery life is excellent, the button is strategically placed, and it's quite bright. I feel safe knowing that cars will see me, and that's all that matters. It's also stayed put, even though I hop off curbs and bang my bike around.5 Stars for sure."
2,Horrible bike mount.,"The light itself is really bright. The bike attachment piece is cheap soft plastic. Couldn't get the screw tight enough to hold the light in a level position, so it was often pointed at the ground. Finally the screw vibrated loose and I lost it somewhere. I didn't have the light attached at the time so I mounted it to my rack with the mounting kit that was provided with the rack."
2,Worked great but it fell off,"It attached very firmly to my seat post. Everything was great, but it has a quick release that made it fall off my bike. I was not on rough terrain. Where is a blinky that will not fall off? I would not buy again."
2,Adequate but there is Better,"I recently bought three different bicycle tail lights, one for each of my family's three bikes. This was the worst of the three. It is fairly bright, but not as bright as the other two (all had new batteries). The other two can also be seen through a wider angle, making it easier for traffic to see the light even when they are not approaching from directly behind the bike. The best of the three was the Planet Bike Blinky Superflash."
1,Absurdly small plastic bit on clip breaks too easily,"I received this and mounted this bike light on the same day and biked out to my night job, which clearly explains the need for a rather bright bike light. I will concede that the light is quite bright, and blinks reasonably well. However, let me frame the scenario for you: I ride a cruiser bike, single-speed, on a city road the whole way, no off-roading or rough gravel road, yet this broke off THAT VERY SAME NIGHT as I was returning home. Fortunately I noticed and was able to retrieve the fallen light without too much of a detour. What a disappointment! Upon further inspection, I saw that the part broke off was a tiny plastic bit on the clip that attached the light to the bracket. Really, PlanetBike, really? You're supposed to be a bike company and you make something so fragile? Now I have to see if I can get a replacement or refund, and get something else that has actual practicality. Sheesh."
3,So so,"It does the trick for the weekend warrior. But if you like trail blazin' down the streets of DC like I do, get yourself at least a Cat-eye."
3,Does not stay in place well,"I have this attached to the bike and it keeps working itself lose. I keep a tool handy so its not a big issue for me, but maybe an issue for others."
4,"nice and bright, 2 different mounting options","Length:: 0:08 MinsWhat can I really say, bright, nice, seems reliably. The only issue I had was no instructions to get the batteries in or placing the clip on. When you get it, it looks like you have to remove the belt clip that is already on it, but the fact of matter it don't move so the mounting clip goes over the belt clip. I would assume this be easy release so if you did wanted to go jogging or something in the dark. Just a idea."
1,"Absolute junk. Useless. No way to attach this to a bike; just a pocket on your rear, maybe….",Far too many other options out there to buy before this. Very unhappy with the quality and the ability to fasten to a bike.
1,Uh...,I could never get this apart to actually put the battery in and turn it on. Maybe I'm an idiot. Or weak. Or both. Doesn't seem like it's intuitive to use. Very cheap feeling & flimsy- would not recommend. BOO.
2,Bracket wears out quickly,"If you want to keep the light from slipping out of the bracket, duct tape it. After 3 months of use, it bounced out of the plastic bracket and shattered on the road.I could imagine the bracket breaking completely if accidentally caught by a backpack strap or something. Get something else, this item is only worth the cost of the batteries.Flimsy junk."
2,"bright, but how the heck do you install it?","it took my husband over an hour to get the cover off to put the batteries in.i still can't figure out how in the heck to install this on my bike! there are no instructions - just a picture of the installation options on the side of the carton. but, it doesn't help you figure out where the bits go!edit: since i couldn't install this how it's supposed to be installed, it was just stolen off my bike."
3,Good enough.,"If you're on a budget and want to be seen at night, this is perfect for you. During the day, I think it lacks the brightness. I still turn it on, though..."
3,Ok,It's not the toughest bike light. Putting in batteries is a pain. But it gives off a good amount of light.
5,Quite bright,The LEDs on this unit are very bright making you visible to all the drivers who might run you down. There's no downside to that at all.
4,"Solid, bright light! Can't go wrong with this one!","Easy to install, fantastic brightness... order without any hesitation!The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was, from a design perspective, I prefer the Cateye over this light. The Cateye looks much sleeker on a road bike."
4,bike parts,The blinky tail light was just what I was looking for I was having trouble with mounting brackets staying secure and in place your product is top of line in my opinion thank you for prompt delivery
5,Rear Bike Light,I love my new light. Couldn't find one in our city for the price I paid thru Amazon. My husband is jealous that he bought an inferior one.
4,Great light at a great price!,"This light is quite bright and for the price it really can't be beat! It was also easy to mount onto my bike. I just needed something that would make me visible on the road this works well for that purpose, if you are really worried just buy two!"
4,Descent Light,Light attached just fine to my city bike. The batteries seem to last a long time which is nice. The light also does fine in the rain and cold of Chicago fall and winter. Overall I'm satisfied with it.
5,"Works great, and at a reasonable price","Excellent bike light, easy to install and very visible in the flashing mode. I often ride early in the morning when it's dark, so being seen by cars is very important when you have little or no shoulder to ride on. This light works great, it's cheap, and it uses regular batteries that are easy to replace."
5,The real deal!,"There are so many Halloween albums out there to choose from, most mixes from various unnamed and unknown artists. This one is the real deal -- a full compliment of classics from Bobby ""Boris"" Pickett, the original Monster Mash king. I'm putting together a playlist of a few hours of Halloween tunes for an upcoming party and this album will be the backbone of my selections. I've enjoyed listening to every one, even the ones that I have never heard before."
5,Every song is awesome!!!!,"I love this album and some days at work I listen to it over and over again. Every song is great! Nick Marsh, the former lead singer of ""Flesh for Lulu"", has the most amazing voice! The rest of the band is amazing! Listen to it once and you'll be hooked, too!!!!"
3,Something like that other stuff,"Gigantic made a less than dynamic debut in the record world in '93, but with the release of Disenchanted in '96 they left a solid mark. The title track has all the characteristics of a brit-rock classic, fans of bush will probably enjoy this album...I don't think i'm going to spend anymore time reviewing this cd."
5,"Valuable advice, especially in a tight labor market","I had the pleasure of attending a speech by one of the authors of this book, and was very impressed with the business philosophy and subsequently with the book itself. Any company desiring to remain competitive, and even to excel, in today's excruciatingly tight labor market could benefit from the ideas and concrete, real-life (and very interesting) examples provided. Any consumer can tell a story or two about the very positive or negative image a company projected through one of its employees--the ""face"" that company presents to its customers, for better or worse. This book is a real wake-up call to industry, and offers substantive advice which can improve any business from the ground up. Greater employee loyalty and enthusiasm, plus the concomitant benefits to customers, could result from implementation of these sound ideas. As a business owner of many years, I recommend the book very highly."
2,Don't waste your money and time - common sense stuff!,"I bought this book based upon all the great reviews, and wasted both my time and money. How disappointing!There is too much bragging on how great and smart the author is (sorry, but outside of the US nobody knows that company anyway) and even tough I appreciated the genuine willingness to share his experience, this is only common sense.No new insights. Get the Harvard Business Review and you will learn more than in this book.I guess that it might be useful for new entrepreneur or maybe small companies, just for them to double check that they are on the right tracks.Sorry, I tried but just did not learn anything new."
3,not terrible,"This product has helped to lighten my skin a little bit, helping scars look less intense. Still not what i was expecting though. Fine lines didn't diminish and i've been using it for a few weeks now."
2,"""Puppy Whelping"" ... Poor Quality Home Video....","I think this is an over priced ...POOR QUALITY HOME VIDEO...!It offers some info and shows a whelping; however, there are betterproducts...IE... Dr. Robert Hutchison's ""Successful Whelping..."" orFAWN RUN CORP. ... ""SPECIAL DELIVERY"", more information for yourmoney."
2,A little pointless,"Being a teen who has been close to suicide many a time, I know from experience that reasons for suicide are plentiful, but finance is a main problem. Why sell a book on how to prevent suicide? To me thats a little bit of a tease. Also... I don't think parents would buy this book, as the symptoms of a suicidal teen are not in great supply. We hide our feelings. Well, thats just my opinion.... An online 'How to prevent suicide' would be much more effective"
3,This Is A Coffee Table Book Not An Astrophotography Manual.,"The photograghs of the deep sky objects in this book are as amazing as they are gorgeous. Especially, when one relalizes that the photos were done by ""amateur"" astronomers. But this is NOT a practical guide to astrophotography. This is a coffee table book which is why it is so deeply discounted."
5,"Practical ""real-world"" advice and great pictures","I really like everything about this book. It offers great, practical advice on learning how to take ""astro""photos. Many beautiful pictures also. I am currently building my own camera mount based on guidelines in book. Anyone interested in astronomy and/or photography should get it!"
5,"FANTASTIC, IS THE BEST WAY TO SUM IT UP","NEVER BEFORE HAVE I SEEN A BOOK SO WELL THOUGHT THRU AND SO WELL WRITTEN MR DICKINSON HAS SHOWN US AGAIN HOW WELL HE WRITES. I RECIEVED THIS BOOK AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FROM MY PARENTS, AND I LOVE IT. IT SHOWS WONDERFUL DIAGRAMS AND EVERYTHING YOU WOULD NEED TO KNOW. THANK YOU GEOFF NASH"
5,The coolest CD!,The cd is soo cool! Its got an awesome interview with britney telling all about her career and the cd is shaped like britney! Its worth buying!
5,Great!,"This is a CD with NO MUSIC! This is just interviews the Princess of Pop. It's very good, and the price is worth it!"
5,BOB'S BEST WORK,"Being a huge fan of Bob Marley, I consider this my favorite album of his. I dig his songs about love and no worries (while many of those songs are deeper than their surface value), but this album just seems to embody his true beliefs on a more serious level. He was a revolutionary, and with the warrior's spirit in this album, his revolutionary heart will beat forever. Don't pass up this revolution on a disc."
4,"""Every man got the right to decide his own destiny...""","That's one of Marley's best albums. Almost entirely dedicated to Africa, it is about politics and, obviously, the faith in Jah Rastafari. All of the songs are very good, especially ""Zimbabwe"", a joyful song for the conquered indipendence of that state, ""Survival"", a song about the difficult life of lots of black people in the world, ""One drop"" and many more. Highly recommended."
3,Made in China,"What happened to ""Made in the USA"" products? Most everything I purchase online is ""Made in China"", including these nurb bars. I have found the quality of these products to be very inferior to ""Made in the USA"" products. These nurf bars look good on my 1997 Dodge but I am very concerned about their quality."
2,Hoax is a Hoax,"Firstly - It's not that I disagree with everything in this book - it's just that it's mostly a editorial, and I disagree with most of it. It full of innuendoes and opinions and unlike that other reviewers - I do not think very will supported with facts. Their conclusions have no traction in real life - they suggest alternatives for people that even they acknowledge are not available. Further they display a total lack of knowledge of current pension law - i.e. ERISA. The authors are in dire need of some Prosac and if any unwary readers get a hand on this book, a lot of other people may as well. Poorly written and without substance. Read the funnies - I want my money back!"
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed with this book. I've enjoyed watching Bill Wolman on CNBC, but I've concluded that he should stick with television. I found the book frustrating because it provided little if any information on how someone can achieve good results investing in a workplace retirement plan, given the limitations of the system. The book dwelled on a lot of economic history instead of being pragmatic. I also thought it was poorly written. I guess you could say it's yet another case of a media talking head falling flat on his face."
2,Starts out good.. by page 40 it's nearly unbearable.,"The first 30 pages of this book were actually pretty useful. After that however.. it went down hill. I suppose that for someone who knew nothing about 401(k)'s, the book could be somewhat enlightening(for the first 30 pages anyways). After the first 30 pages.. it truly goes way off topic.. at about page 90 I just couldn't take it anymore. Perhaps it gets better after that but I didn't have the will power to find out."
2,Left wing screed,"Dear gentle reader, Save your time and your money. These authors think the fount of political wisdom comes from the British Socialists G.B. Shaw and R.H. Tawney--plus other usual leftist writers. Indeed, anyone who doesn't adopt the the maxim--the bigger the government, the better the government is labled ""a far right winger."" The authors spend most of the book indicting the so-called ""laissez faire, free market ideology of Reagan, Bush, Clinton, and BushII."" They spend very little time actually discusing the intricacies of 401(k) plans--contrary to what their title implies. As to investment advice, Sell stocks, buy bonds. That's it! I found the book a great disappointment. And unless you're a devout subscriber to The Nation or In These Times, you probably will too."
2,What Can I Do About It?,"The Title of the book states ""Why your family is at risk, what you can do about it?"" After nearly 188 pages on the first part of this phrase, the authors talk about ""stillwater"" investing which seems to be ""random walk"" by another name. The authors complain loudly and convincingly (with some irritants mentioned by other reviewers), but I'd have expected similar vigor and greater clarity in listing out the solutions....disappointed."
3,Great action flick but only tolerable dubbing and image...,"I really liked this film as Moon Lee shows some great fighting action throughout the movie. When she stretches during one training scene, you gotta pay attention. The bad part of this dvd is that the master used was already in bad shape. It really just looks like an old vhs copy that's been degrading over the years. And the dubbing...as usual, is quite bad. Can't anyone ever make a decent voice dub over?"
2,TV screen saver,"Moon Lee is THE ONLY saving grace this film has.She does good acting,has good fighting skills-but against poor filming,and cardboard characters-it doesn't hold water.Despite the film dates, it seems like an early seventies film and not a good one.If you're looking for HK femme fatale fighting-Heroic Trio,Executioners,Wing Chun,or even Zero Woman (Japanese-but fits the genre).""I must avenge my brothers death""-hmmm,never heard that line before...."
1,Less than meets the eye.,"Games should be challenging. Humor should be funny. This book is neither. When the revolution comes, someone must answer for this."
1,Buyer Beware!,"This book has NOTHING to do with Cameron Crowe's excellent film of the same name, despite a few oblique references. Crowe's movie was one of the best movies of the eighties: an honest, refreshing look at adolescent fears and responsibilities. This book is a VERY CYNICAL compendium of wiseass ""gee, didn't the eighties suck"" comments couched in a lame attempt to make a quick buck off the subject it mocks. For an excellent alternative, check out ""RAMBO REAGAN,"" a freewheeling journey through a very interesting decade."
1,Would Never Order Again From Here,Very unhappy with this Amazon purchase! I was sent the women's Mania by Giorgio Armani when I ordered the MEN'S!!!! After receiving it I was stuck ...can not be returned and I don't care for the sent so I will not be wearing it. This was a waste of my time and money. If getting the wrong product doesn't make you mad enough I could not even post this without giving it at least 1 star......I give it NO STARS
5,Top 5,This fragrance will forever be one of my alltime favorites. It's long lasting and has a smell for any occasion; because it isn't loud. I cant even find it in Dept stores anymore. This gem will soon be discontinued. I recommend grabbing one before it's too late.....
1,Poor construction,This was very dissappointing. Pieces were damaged coming out of the box. The first drawer broke as it was being assembled. Online distributers offer free shipping because it will cost you too much to return so you are stuck with it. Check dimensions! This is a minature version of a desk. Very poor quality!
3,Poor Quality,"Poor quality. Not an actual white finish. More like a washed white with woodgrain showing through. Will not last long or withstand children very long, I am sure. I wish I would have chosen a different product. I would NOT recommend this desk if you are looking for a semi decent piece of furniture."
2,You get what you pay for,"We have the headboard, nightstand and dresser the veneer finish is peeling of at the edges. But for the price this is what you get. I did not expect to see the (fake) wood grain, this is like a whitewashed finish. The nighstand is smaller than I expected, it's shorter than an average nighstand. If I could go back I would of spent a little more money for better quality pieces."
3,Pearl means wood grain design laminant.,"The desk is small, so it's perfect for my daughters 9.5'x9.5' room. Not the best laminant job. There was one board that was warped, but I'll have them send me a new one. The drawers are a healthly size. Most of the chair fits under. It doesn't protrude too badly, but it doesn't go in all the way to the back rest."
1,Wondering who was pleased with this desk?,"We recently bought the desk for my little girl and was going to surprise her for her birthday which is Christmas day. When my husband took it out of the box to put it together, some of the pieces weren't fitting right and glue that should have stayed wasn't."
3,Needs a bolt,"This is a great product, but it's missing a bolt and I can't get Amazon to send it to me. Customer service rep said someone would call me to arrange shipping of bolt but it never happened. Then Amazon emailed me to tell me they would send me $20. Would like the $20, but really need the bolt. C'mon, Amazon. Just send me the M6 x 1.00mm x 10L Bolt, and this will be a 5 star item."
2,Amazonian Error,"Received product from Amazon without the critical suction cups that allow the pole to adhere to floor and ceiling. Without these cups, the rack will surely fall over. I've seen the product in stores, so I know it works. Just make sure you get a complete product before installing."
4,It works when you install it right.,I'm not giving this 5 stars because the first time I received the stand it was beat to hell and had obviously been opened before by someone else. Since it is sold and shipped right from Amazon a 1-star deduction seems appropriate.All in all this stand works. I keeps my bikes up and out of the way and if you install it correctly and take an extra measure of security by installing a safety tether up top you should never have an issue with this falling. Putting it together is a breeze and adjustment is also quick and simple.
5,Real Space Saver,"Great piece of gear, well made and sturdy and just what one needs to keep bikes up and out of the way."
1,Also fell on my car.,"This fell on my car...twice. The first time not much damage was done to the car probably because two bikes were mounted and the lower bike helped slow the fall. The 2nd time, after remounting in what I thought was a more secure way, it was a couple months later and there was only the top bike mounted...much more damage was done to the car. Thanks Topeak for making a product that is probably going to cost me over $1000 easy."
5,Excellent Storage,"I purchased this rack three months ago for my apartment to provide indoor indoor bike storage for my road bike. It fits easily near the wall and adjusts to variable ceiling height. Set up is pretty easy, and it is very stable. I have had zero problems with it. I suggest getting the additional handlebar stabilizers to prevent your front tire from marking up the wall. Durable, I expect this rack to last a decade or more."
2,Be very careful,"I liked this stand very much, and installed it in my garage about 1.5 years ago. The stand and bicycles came crashing down a couple of months back, putting a sharp dent in a car. The basic problem with this stand is that it relies on friction between the floor and ceiling to work. I'm guessing that as the seasons passed, changes in the weather caused the ceiling to move a little, perhaps even give a little (this is despite the stand being installed right where a truss is).Regardless of the cause, the net result is that over time, this stand will work itself loose, with potentially disastrous consequences.My conclusion? Get yourself a stand that is bolted to the wall/ceiling, or else find someway to secure this stand to the same---so nullifying the stand's raison d'tre."
1,The rack fell on my car,"This rack is highly unstable. It was holding two bikes in my garage, and fell down while I was away on vacation. Both bikes and the rack landed on the hood of my car, causing several dents and scratches."
1,Stand fell on my car too...,"I installed this in my garage. It was mounted under a stud and secure at the time of installation. After 12 days it fell on my car and left dents and scratches. It caused $2,100 in damage to my car. I believe the vibration of the garage door opening and closing allowed the stand to become loose. I would not recommend this stand to anyone."
4,A must have!,Every budding shredder needs this. I'd give it a 5 star but it lacks a bit of technical detail. Gilbert is such a impeccable player though so just buy it anyway.Davidwww.speedpicking.com
4,Very good instructional DVD,"Paul gilbert does a good job at explaining all the sequences. the only reason i don't give it a perfect rating is that part one gets kind of boring to watch, and you need to get through a lot of it in order to understand part 2."
3,This is NOT for beginners!,"I read good reviews about this guy and this video. I even saw some clips of him on youtube and that convinced me to buy this. However when I got it and watched it, I noticed he went too fast in his instruction for me to keep up. My biggest gripe is that he does not teach you the rudimentary techniques such as how to hold the pick so that you can pick as fast as he is. I found myself pausing the video a lot just to get the lick. The DVD comes with a printable PDF booklet (13 pgs). This is def not for beginners. It would have been better if he started out showing you how to use a metronome in shredding and subdividing notes. The included sample vid with John Petrucci (he shows you shredding with a metronome) was what this video should have been."
5,Essential for any guitarist in improving technique,"Paul's ability to teach is amazing. VERY relevant and ALWAYS fun! For 20 years now he has been and continues to keep things easily understood that are essential in taking your technique to a new level. As a player whom has been playing for 30 years now myself, Paul's breakdown of left and right-hand technique finally got me over the ""hump"" I had not been able to overcome most of my guitar playing days as I finally overcame a plateau and quickly saw noticable improvment in speed and accuracy as I finally got the metronome setting to click higher than ever and still growing."
3,"A fair book, an interesting story","Perhaps this book is not the best choise to read about Horatio Nelson, a simple book reprinted by this Editorial (a great idea anyway, to reprint old books), with not very good pictures, no maps, but that accomplish its goal though which is to grasp the personality and the important facts in the life of Admiral Nelson. This life is marked by his love affair with Emma Hamilton and by his tremendous accomplishment as Navy commander, particularly in the Trafalgar Battle, an emotional moment chosen for giving his life for the flag and in this way secure the future of his beloved Emma and his little Horatia - at least he died thinking that. Again in this important battle we have the British superior in planning, strategy and better prepared to engage combat than their counterparts - a great achievement that allowed Britain to consolidate his empire. This is the life of a normal chap who was an exceptional navy commander."
3,Cherry Lips(Go Baby Go),"This cd is so terribal. The only good song are Use Me and Enough Is Never enough, 2 very good B-Sides. Now I don't hate the Cherry Lips song but it's just not a song that connects with me. I love the song live though. The Cherry Lips remix is bad too I mean if you wanna dance it's pure dance music remix. So I hope this review helped I would not waste my money on this cd. I would download the 2 B-Sides off the interent."
4,FIRE POWER WITH A SMALL BANG,"NOT ONE OF THEIR BEST ALBUMS, CONSIDERING THEIR FIRST 2 WERE TOTALLY AWESOME. STILL, I LIKED THIS ALBUM. THE MATERIAL IS NOT AS STRONG AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. SO LETS START WITH THE OPENER. ""THE UNDERWORLD KING"" RANKS UP THEIR WITH THEIR PREVIOUS EFFORTS. DEFINETLY HOT STUFF. ""MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE"" LAGS. THE REMAKE OF THE OLDIES CLASSIC ""YOU'VE LOST THAT LOVIN' FEELIN'"" IS OUT OF PLACE ON THIS RECORD. ""REMEMBER MY NAME"" IS A CATCHY CLASSIC LEGS DIAMOND EFFORT. ACCUSTICALLY BRILLIANT, WITH THE SONG PICKING UP THE PACE TOWARDS THE END. ""CHICAGO"" IS GOOD OLD TIME ROCK AND ROLL.""MIDNIGHT LADY"" IS NOT A STRONG PIECE, BUT A GOOD SONG IN ITSELF. ""HELP WANTED"" IS A LOVE SONG THATS JUST O.K. ""COME WITH ME"", ""TRAGEDY"", & ""MAN AT THE TOP"" CLOSE OUT THE L.P., AND ALL 3 ARE LEGS DIAMOND TO THE HILT. I WASN'T FORTUNATE TO HAVE THE BONUS TRACK. OVERALL I RECOMMEND THIS CD BECAUSE IT DOES CONTAIN SOME CLASSIC LEGS DIAMOND MATERIAL."
3,Solid College Hoops Sim,"If you played and enjoyed NBA 2k7 you'll like this year's college version. You can create your own chant style; the crowd is amazing, the game engine is solid and plays very well. However, that said, CH 2K7 still feels like its prior version in same ways: graphically, I don't think anything has changed, and the player models are not really that good. There are quite a few glitches here and there, but they don't ruin the game. Online, XBOX LIVE, there seems to be more lag time and dropped games for some reason. If you have an HDTV, you do get a clearer improvement of text and graphics.It will be interesting to see how EA's March Madness stacks up. Rumor is EA used a whole new game engine and not the clunky NBA Live's. For now, CH 2K7 is the only game to get in college version."
5,Love it!!,"I bought this DVD last year and I cant stop watching it! LOL. For Laruku fans, this DVD worth to buy!!! I love Hyde!!"
5,I love this DvD!!!!,"I just recieved my copy of L-Arc-en-Ciel today and Wow it is great. the quality is great, the sound is great, the cd is great, and the bonus Dvd of Revelation live in Japan was An awesome plus to an already awesome Dvd. If you are a fan of Hyde/L'Arc-en-Ciel this is an absolute must have, And for the 12$ It cost me it was an absolute steal."
5,Awesome DVD!,This DVD is awesome! I haven't been a fan of l'arc~en~ciel for very long so I never went to the concert they had last year in the US. So if you are fan I think you'll love this DVDThe only thing I wish they would have added was subtitles for the backstage stuff because I don't know Japanese so I never knew what they were talking about
5,Tara Sloan is so cool,I just recently discovered Joydrop and Tara Sloan. This Cd is really great. Tara's vocals are just amazing. I don't know how Tara and Joydrop never hit my radar screen but thats alright its new to me and I have to listen daily.
2,Collective Disappointment,"This book was chosen by my office reading group. It was generally felt to be a disappointment. I for one really liked the writing style and prose but wondered why simpler words were not chosen. Some felt, too, they required a dictionary by their side. It was definitely a book one could easily put down. There wasn't much in the way of character development and the story lacked intrigue. The ending, too, was a disappointment."
5,Absolutely wonderful,"It is more than just a photography book. It had feeling. emotion, and a sense of being in this war we are facing. Thank you Mr. Tamarov"
4,U.S. Afghanistan Veteran Can Relate,"Great book, with great photos. Vladislav Tamarov writes in a simple style, but conveys the inner-thoughts, comraderie, fear and terror that a foreign soldier experiences in a war in Afghanistan. Despite being on different sides of the Cold War, and fighting for two totally different Afghan governments, I can identify with Tamarov's experience. A great book if you want a better understanding of a soldier's life in Afghanistan, with no in-depth analysis of the strategic or operational side of the Soviet-Afghan War."
5,A must have book in every home,"I had tears in my eyes while reading this book. This is not about a professionally trained journalist going into Afghanistan to write a book. This was about a man who did what he had to do to survive 621 days and use photography as his life saver. Here was a kid, a very young man, 18, going into battle to fight for his country. His journal of his 621 days was an eye opener beyond belief. I have been trying to find a copy for weeks. My friend had this book and I would do almost anything to own my own copy."
1,I was disappointed at the absense of depth.,"The author is a self described ""break-dancer and photographer"", not author. The words in the book are meant as a description of the frequent (every other page) full page black and white pictures. In total the text portion of the book represents about 34 pages. A coffee table book at best."
3,Not Bad: Great Photos But Terribly Written,"This is an interesting book, terribly written, without form and much substance, and virtually no organization. Yet the content and photos are quite interesting. It can be read in about an hour. Good airplane book."
1,I have not received the book yet!,"Dear Sirs, as of now I have not received the book yet. Would you be so kind as to let me know when will it arrive?thanks in advancecatalina anton mexico"
4,Digestive Enzymes,"I was hoping that take this pill would reduce flatulence, but not in my case. I had to try it."
2,too many pills,"I was excited about getting this vitamin until they came and I realized I had to take 6 per day. Split the dose into 2 times a day. I tried that seeing all the wonderful ingredients listed, but they upset my stomach. I had to go back to my store brand. I wish someone could make a supplement like this that you only had to take one of. And put some enteric coating on it. Thanks!"
1,This band should have quit years ago.,"This is a joke right? This isn't a real release is it? This is the funniest thing I have heard in a while. I like their first 3 discs, but this is just funny. The lyrics were penned by kids right? I just don't get this cd. AVOID THIS!"
5,Down and Dirty Rock n Roll at it's finest,If you were a fan of the early Waysted records when Fin was the singer you we'll enjoy this record. Musically it is very similar but Pete's voice sounds more like Duff from Gun's n Roses....but it truly works.The record at times even appears to have an early 90's Seattle Grunge sound. So for God sakes go buy the record.Tim
3,Pete Way Goes Solo,I listened to this CD several times in a row on a long trip in my vehicle. I liked it better each time I listened. Pete's vocals are somewhat weak but this whole CD has a great groove to it. The only thing I found unusual was Pete's preoccupation with drug references and his fixation with the drug infested street of America. This solo CD was an unexpected surprise and I recommend it to all UFO fans
3,"No, it's not UFO...","...and it wasn't meant to be. It's just Pete having some fun and stretching beyond the melodic confines of UFO. It's just some tough, high-energy ""punkish"" rock with minimal fuss."
1,I want my money back,"I bought this believing that the great Pete Way from the even greater UFO could do no wrong. Boy, was I wrong. Stay away from this. After listening to it twice I sold mine back to the store within a week for a fraction of its original cost. And the running time was only around 30 minutes. Ouch!"
2,waste of money,"If you're looking for something that will keep your coffee or tea REALLY HOT, don't waste your money! After about 5 minutes it's barely lukewarm and worthless for keeping anything hot. Works fine with my ice tea but for hot drinks it just doesn't work. Very disappointed."
3,All Looks and No Functionality,"This is a cute mug and it comes in great colors. I love the amount of liquid it holds. However, it is not insulated enough for hot drinks. My coffee gets cold in less than an hour because all the warmth escapes through the large drink hole. This is especially a problem when I am traveling to work in the winter. As soon as I go outside and get in my car, my coffee has already gotten cold! There is no way to close off the lid, so it's not spill-proof either. Another side note: it doesn't fit in my car's cup holder. I would not recommend this product for hot drinks or traveling."
2,Missing lid!!!,I liked the color. I liked the size of the cup. What I didn't like was that it was missing the lid and being told by customer service that a replacement couldn't be sent but that I would have to send the cup back then re-order it....are you kidding me?? I guess I should count myself lucky. Yea right.
4,great for your desk,"I really enjoy this cup at home and work. It is the perfect size. I wish it fit better in my car cupholder, but I usually take it to work empty anyway. I have been using them mostly for cold drinks right now and it works wonderfully. They do sweat, but most cups do. I like a lot of ice in my drinks. Its a great cup at a great price."
3,Not as good as the older MiGo cups,"I have some MiGo mugs from several years ago - a little smaller, more rounded - and love them. This one is a great size (20 oz) but, sadly, it often leaks around the lid and runs down my chin onto my shirt! If I remember to sort of twist the lid back and forth while pressing down it seems to help. Also, if it's very full it's hard to get a good sip out - like the liquid is held back by the shape of the lid, then it comes out suddenly, burning my mouth or drenching me. Likewise, it slops all over if it's nearly empty - I have to take off the lid to finish my drink. It's a cute mug, but a bit difficult. I didn't have these problems with my older MiGos."
2,A poor replacement.,I ordered this one over others because I mistakenly believed that it was one of the MiGo mugs. This one is manufactured by Aladdin who have presumably bought out the MiGo brand. The MiGo mugs had better fitting lids and a rubber pad on the base. These Aladdin mugs are clearly not held to the same manufacturing tolerances. I wish I could go back in time and dump that ex before she microwaved the hell out of my good MiGo mugs.
5,Wonderful Hot Chocolate Mug,"I was looking for a good Hot Chocolate Mug for this Winter, and found this product. The handle fits my hand perfectly - the cocoa stays steamy hot, and the rubber on the bottom keeps the cup from tipping over. I'd love one in every color, but for now, this is the one color Amazon had."
5,Quick and a great price,This book arrived quickly and in the condition stated! I had to replace this book for the library and was glad to find this book and at a great price too!
5,I loved reading this book!,"The back cover of the book reads as follows: ""Guarding dynamite in a lightning storm would be easier than guiding this one willful redhead all the way west, Gabe Cutter fumed. Yet his Pinkerton-honed instincts told him he needed to uncover her secrets-and fast! For she was definitely not what she claimed to be!Fate had given her a reprieve - and ""Phoebe Gray"" couldn't waste it on some hard-boiled trail boss with pain in his past and trouble in his future. Still, when she'd switched identities with her companion, she never imagined she'd be hand-delivered into the undreamed passion of Gabe Cutter's loving arms!""This story has everything strong characters, a plot line that keeps you reading and wondering who is trying to stop the train or Phoebe from going west. Not to mention the passion that sparks between the two of them. There is also a wonderful twist in the end. Well written - so enjoy the reading!"
3,a nice little western.......,"The other reviews detail the plot accurately. It's a cute plot with great characters. Really liked the tormented hero, gabe, and all his actions rang very true to character but our heroine louisa/phoebe was a bit shallow and got a little whiney for me.Nice plot twist a time or two makes it an enjoyable read. Not one of Binghams best though."
1,A WASTE OF PAPER,"I have read Clives first novel ""Dando on Dehli Ridge"", and expected to be entertained with his second book on the Imperial British soldier Joseph Dando, what a disappoinment. The first novel was full of the daily life and routine of being a member of Her Majesty's infantry,the training, discipline, and weapons that help young British soldiers slaughter thousands of lesser equipped and trained combatants throughout the third world. This second work on young Dando is a ""waste of paper"". Please save your money."
3,"Bought with BelOMO 10x, putting this one in a bad light","Unless you really, absolutely gotta have 20x, the BelOMO 10x is vastly superior. The BelOMO is easier to navigate and focus, with a larger viewable area, and better image quality. The 20x is just painful to use by comparison. It may be good by comparison with other 20x loupes, but it suffers dramatically in comparison to the BelOMO."
5,Wow!,"This album first came into my collection around 1992. I have not stopped listening to it since. It is just wonderful. The songs are tightly structured, and it is his finest work lyrically. The songs are wide-ranging, yet immediate. There is a true joy in the playing and performance. The title song says it all. Absolutely beautiful, and a rocker too!"
4,Feeling Better,I bought this product for my 70 year old grandmother and she hasn't stopped thanking me!
1,really red!,I was gonna use it for a merida costume but when I got it the thing was as red as a tamato i was really mad!!
1,Misrepresentation,"The item shipped to me is NOT what is pictured in the online view. The wrenches they sent ARE ratcheting, but NOT flex handles. I contacted the vendor, and he said that the description is clear, thus eliminating any possibility of reimbursement. I read the description, yep, it's clear, NOT flex handles....so the WRONG picture was used. Not a happy camper...Jerry Witt"
2,wrong item shipped,"I ordered Mitsukan Mustard and Soy flavored dressing, but received Mustard and Miso dressing...... The items cost too much money to return, so I guess I'm stuck with something I don't want :0("
3,"For the Uninitiated it's a good read.Been there,done that.","In the early seventies I was immersed in Edgar Cayce, Carl Jung, and Plate Tectonics which at that time was still theory. I understand where GMS is coming from, but I feel he is a bit short-sighted on Karma and the effects of our consciousness on the Cosmos. In the words of Viktor Frankl, ""What is demanded of man is not,as some existential philosophers teach, to endure the meaninglessness of life, but rather to bear his incapacity to grasp its unconditional meaningfulness in rational terms."
1,Gordon Michael Scallion is....,"Although gordon Michael Scallion is a decent human being, like most self-discovered or self-proclaimed ""prophets"" in this day and age they usually modify predictions to fruition, ignore failed predictions and hail realized ones; and whats worse, many of the realized ones had a 50-50 chance of coming true. Of course something ""bad"" will eventually happen: the real prophet knows when EXACTLY. LOOK UP PREDICTIONS ON ""GOOGLE"" FOR SUCCESS RATE ON HIS GUESSES."
1,UTTER NONSENSE,"This is utter nonsense. Don't waste your time reading his material. It is a shame that so many people are sucked into this nonsense. If you want to waste your money, go ahead, be my guest, but don't blame me that I did not warn you. Do your own research on the internet, before you buy any of his books.Amazon should come up with a negative star rating for material of this caliber."
2,Disappointing,I bought this because I loved the music in 5th Element. Nothing else was that interesting.
4,pretty spendy...,Check out Lee Valley tools before you lay out the bucks for this one. It's a nice tool but kinda spendy. You can get saddle squares from Lee Valley for a lot less money. The adjustable angle is not something you will use much.
2,Not for beginners and not a step by step learning book.,"I am totally new to Premiere 6.5 and thought this 'picture' book would take me by the hand and teach me step by step. It does not do that as it is more of a collection of 2 page 'How To' articles on various aspects of the program. I'm sure it's a good reference book to look up how to do individual steps, but it doesn't sit you down and take you through a learning process. This software is probably the most complicated I've ever had, and I've used Photoshop for 7 years. Very frustrating."
5,Truly a masterpiece for all!,"This DVD simply takes you on a journey of mythology, poetry and history of Norouz, Persian Rite of Spring, through the artistic talent of Miss Niloufar Talebi. Truly a masterpiece live @ L.A.C.M.A.(Los Angeles Contemporary Museum of Art) and on DVD!!!"
4,Husband and wife duo...down to earth Gospel,"Old school Gospel, hubby and wife duo, Gospel music has changed now 2010, If your tired of hearing hip hop in today's Gospel music, back up a decade and throw down on this release, late 80's early 90's Gospel is much more down to earth. this takes me way back, I love this couple's work in gospel"
5,Fantastic collaboration,"This Cd is really great. Lydia does her sultry thing accompanied by a really cool sort of jazzy/techno background. Its a little too short for me to be truely happy, I hope she does another disc with anubian lights."
2,"Anubian Lights & Lydia Lunch - 'Chamagne,Cocaine,Nicotine Stains' (Crippled Dick Hot Wax)","This five-track EP is reportedly vocalist,actress and poet Lydia Lunch's first ever solo effort.Notice that two key Anubian Lights members Tommy Grenas and Len Del Rio appears on this EP.Didn't exactly knock me out,but two cuts here that I thought were 'okay' are the title track,""Champagne,Cocaine..."" and ""Potango Tango"".A bit more electronic/techno-ish than I had expected.Not exactly my cup of tea."
1,No English Subtitles,"This movie looked great and I purchased a rental of it, only to find that there are no English subtitles. This was particularly ridiculous since the English translation of the title is prominent in the ad. Amazon quickly credited me the rental amount, but I notice that no note has been placed on the item on the website warning non-Spanish speaking customers of the problem."
1,"""A Waste of time and Money""",Where do they come from? Sure would be nice to have a book with something useful in it. This is a re-hash of the HP Documentation set.
5,Early Cure at their absolute best,"For those of us who never got to see the Cure in the early years (in fandom, pre-'86), this is a pretty decent consolation prize. The songs chosen for this live compilation are wonderful, and the performance is incredible. This album is a true, and often-forgotten, Cure classic. In fact, it's a must-own for any fan of early Cure."
1,Can't get serial number from Adobe,"Since Serious Magic was purchased from Adobe, you can only purchase this from the Adobe website.The problem is that Adobe doesn't send you a serial number. They send you an e-mail that tells you to call Customer Service or check your account online in the downloads section for your serial number.Your online account tells you to call Customer Service.Customer Service refers you to the installation program where there is a button that says ""Get Installation Key"".The ""Get Installation Key"" button takes you back to the Adobe website where you login and it tells you to call Customer Service for your serial number.See where this is headed?Even better, Adobe will not give you a refund without a serial number.I'd heard good reviews about this software, but DO NOT recommend purchasing from Adobe online.[...]"
5,Beautiful,Everything was perfect. My review was delayed because my ex-roomie accidentally took the package when she moved out. And just today did I finally drive over to her new place of dwelling and picked it up.Thanks!
1,now and then used cd,Cd was scratchy and skipped. I don't think I will get anymore used cds because this has happened to me before. The cd itself is wonderful beat for working out but not when its skipping.
5,This music has a place in my heart,"I liked the movie, but I really love this soundtrack. It's what I put on when I'm tired of being an adult. The Archies, The Jackson Five, Stevie Wonder... they were all a part of my childhood... back when I took my allowance to Woolworth's every week and to buy a 45. If you remember those days fondly, you'll love this album. It's full of bubblegum favorites that still bring a smile to my face."
5,great,i love this soundtrack. it is awsome. im not really into oldies or anything but i really liked all the songs ont this. mainly because the songs made me sing along
5,The Now and Then Soundtrack is great fun to listen to.,"This soundtrack is great fun to listen to, and it gets you in a happy mood. The songs are easy to dance to, and they bring back memories of when music was actually good. The soundtrack is great to have at parties."
4,Review of Now and Then CD,"My daughter-in-law was thrilled to get this as a birthday gift. She has played it everyday since receiving it. She did make a comment that the case the CD was in was cracked on arrival. The CD is fine, but I was a bit disappointed that it came in a cracked case."
2,Wrong Cord,Received a 4 foot cord instead of a 6 foot cord as was stated in the description. Had to return it. Happened twice!
2,Disney Tent,When I purchased the tent I thought it had Mickey Mouse on it since that was the picture that was listed on the website. When I received the tent it had Winnie the Pooh on it. I wish it would have been more clear in the description and photo.
5,Great,Savoy Brown was/is one of the rockingest groups to come out of the late sixties. This album is one of their better releases. This version of Savoy Brown became Foghat after their lead guitarist decided to go in a different direction.Amazon sent it in a timely fashion.
4,a classic!,What else needs be said? Down to a 4-piece here with Lonesome Dave handling the vox. Kim shines as usual.
4,Looking In,"Good British 60's music - bluesie, laid-back mellow music. Lonesome Dave's guitar work is good and the music is quite enjoyable."
5,The best,"I like 12 Rods as much as I like music in general. This is my favorite album of all time. I've been listening to it frequently for about nine months now, and A) I still love to listen to it, B) I still notice new interesting things in the songs. The first album I got of 12 Rods' was Separation Anxieties. It blew me away, and it was instantly in my top 10 favorite albums ever. Then I got Split Personalities and couldn't even listen to Separation Anxieties anymore. That's how good this album is."
3,Sounds like the initial effort of a band going somewhere.,I'm surprised to not find any mention of Brian Wilson/Beach Boys/Pet Sounds in the short reviews and descriptions I've seen. They have a feel and direction that could really take them somewhere as they become more focused. They lack the intensity of the Foo Fighters but may be more interesting ultimately.
1,dont waste your money,"this cd is a verry poor excuse period,the sound is the the worst i've heard. all of the worth while music is available elsewhere.sun records really put out a real looser with this one.save your self some money. i'm selling the one i bought,very disappointing"
4,Simply wonderful,"The first song I heard from this album was ""Je suivivrai"". I was really surprised that she did such a different and, at the same time, wonderful cover of the old-time ""I will survive"". I just loved it. But if you want to discover one of the greatest singers I have ever heard, please buy this CD. You can find all kinds of music. ""Il suffira"" is one of the most beautiful ballads I have heard for years. ""Tu m'oublieras"" and ""On ne s'aimera plus jamais"" are R&B-like songs that you won't stop dancing. Buy it, you won't regret it."
1,Deceiving,I ordered this dresser for my daughter. When it arrived it did NOT have a pearl white finish at all. Plus several parts were broken and had to be reordered. Do not buy this item.
3,Wrong version of Beyond Belief and Creed!!!,Bummer... this collection has the wrong version of Creed and Beyond Belief. I should have listed to the demo songs before purchasing this album...
2,"The correct ""Creed"" and ""Beyond Belief"" versions are NOT ON THIS, but on THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION disc 2","Fortunately I discovered that this album has some strange toned-down, non-rock version of ""Creed"" and ""Beyond Belief"", which was quite disappointing... until I discovered that the correct rock versions ARE on the ""Ultimate Collection"" album on disc 2. So I bought ""Creed"" as an MP3 single off of that album - NOT THIS ALBUM which has the WRONG VERSIONS!"
3,"Some great tunes, but ...","Read the reviews from others (and had heard some tracks) so made the purchase ... but seriously, not a scratch on On Fire! Forget about labelling On Fire! as one of the greatest Christian Rock releases of the era ... one of the Rock releases of the era!"
5,Awesome!,"Of all the 80's (or 80's style) rock albums that I own, this has to be one of the best. It contains a great mix of hard rock songs, rock anthems, and ballads. It also spreads the message of God very well in the lyrics. ""Creed, Beyond Belief, Armed and Dangerous, Underground, etc."" are all awesome rock songs. ""Love"" and ""Prayer"" are the two beautiful ballads, with ""Prayer"" being one of the best ""power ballads"" I have ever heard, and no guitars(well, maybe a bass guitar) or drums are used in it. This album is awesome, and for anyone into 80's rock, this album is a must, whether you are a believer or not."
4,Petra truly are Beyond Belief,"This rocks! From the group that told us that ""God gave rock 'n' roll to you"", comes proof that true rock 'n' roll is God-centred. Great guitar riffs and uplifting lyrics, in an album that hasn't dated!"
4,"Easy to read, but keeps all the details!","This book makes it simple to read, so it doesn't take as long to get through chapters as other textbooks. It doesn't leave any details out, either, so it's really the best of both worlds."
4,Awesome,The order and all aspects went so well. I love ordering from Amazon and all its proprietors.
1,massive disapointment,"Wow, I bought this album with high hopes and the cd ended up under my bed all scratched up for lack of caring. Not very good at all. Generic, basic and noticeably dull considering it comes from one of the great front men of all time."
2,Garbage,"Don't waste your time on this, it's nothing like either ST or IG. Muir must have really lost his brain with this one."
5,"Short and to the point, well worth the investment.","If you're looking for commiserative rhetoric, you'll not find it in this book. Nor will you find endless chapters of redundant psychobabble. What you will find is a commonsense look at the failed attempts of the intelligentsia to manufacture justice. This book is short and to the point. Mr. Sowell has demonstrated that when truth is on you side, you don't need pages of grandiloquence to justify your reasoning. Mr. Sowell does an outstanding job of explaining why our Founders had it right and our attempts to improve on social justice misses the point. If you want to know how and why your rights and privileges are being swallowed, you need to read this book."
5,Thomas Sowell: Challenger to Convention Wisdom,"Sowell's eloquence has again produced another critical exposure of the ""anointed"" in the world's political and social arena. Sowell's logic and analysis is brilliant. Rather than exposing the anointed as wrong, Sowell points out the costs and consequences of those who pursue policies of universal justice. this book is for anyone looking for challenges to the conventional wisdom in public policy today."
5,Outstanding Expose of Liberlaism,A tour de force expose of 20th century liberalism's phony claims to being more caring and compassionate than anyone. His expose clearly shows how damaging and destructive liberalism's programs have been when backed up by the coercive force of government. He exposes liberal's self-anointed visions through self-exaltation as being a classic definition of insanity.Will it get through to the non-reading public majority we can only hope.
4,Shaun Hutson has done it again,"Knife Edge is the third (but Shaun has assured us not the final) time we have met the seemingly indestructible Sean Doyle, Renegades and White Ghost, being the first two. This is, like the prequels a completely captivating book and you have no idea what will happen to the hero, Doyle, because being such an unlikely hero you are half expecting him to self-destruct at any point. This becomes apparent immediately in the book.As usual in Hutson's novels, the character development in the book is superb. Hutson spends 5-7 pages building up a profile of a person in the book, their hopes, their dreams, their future plans etc. who you then expect to become a major character in the book, then he will just simply blow them up or kill them in some other fashion.Hutson is a superb talent and I recommend that anyone should read a book by him and this is as good a book as any."
2,Super Hits 1994,"Not what I expected. Plus, although I paid for expedited shipping, it arrived after 10 days, after I had left town. Regular shipping items arrived din 3-4 days."
2,Very slow going.,"Sir Walter Scott basically invented the genre of historical fiction, and usually his works clip along at a pretty good rate, but this foray into European history is slow and diffuse. I am about 7/8 through, but don't think I will finish. I am stuck in the court of King Rene, in Provence, with the humorless and wooden prig who passes for Our Hero while the Duke of Burgundy is off getting himself killed. I don't care enough about any of the characters, including Our Hero* and the eponymous Anne, to see the action through.*I put the book down a few weeks ago and now I can't even remember the hero's name."
3,They are comfortable and worth buying for thier price,I bought these shoes thinking of their low price and nice looks. I found them really comfortable and good.
3,Musically Unsatisfying,"I got this at the recommendation of somebody, and I must say it's not what I expected. Maybe I just can't appreciate this album, since I lean more towards Metal-Industrial, but I just didn't find it pleasing to listen to. Interesting and creative, yes, but not pleasing; it reminds me of Skinny Puppy, another Industrial band that I couldn't really get into either. It's just not my cup of tea, and I suspect that most people probably won't (or perhaps can't) appreciate it either. There's nothing wrong with it, but it just something I can't enjoy, so I'm giving it 3 stars."
3,Not the best Coil album,"This album is quite interesting, but doesn't have that something that their newer work has."
5,an undiscovered artistic gem,"This is a complex and multi-layered work of electronic music. In my opinion, this the best showcase for the artistic power of Coil who blend here music and lyrics into a powerful masterpiece of an album. One could see this as a theme-album on Apocalypse, and I think that the liner notes on the original LP release reveal that Coil had something like that in mind when they made the album.In that sense, from begining to end it is original and breathtaking. The chiling power of impending doom can be sensed in the opening pieces, complete desctruction is described in ""Penetralia"", and it all ends very appropriately with the mystery and anticipation evoked in ""The first five minutes after death"". Listen to this album in the dark, after midnigth, and it will be an unforgetable experience!!"
5,"You swallow one, you just swallow another...","Dark. Soul crushing. Insanity. My first experience with Coil was the ""How To Destroy Angels"" release. NOT what I expected, considering I bought their work for the NIN remixes they had done. Yeah, such a shame Coil were about 80x better. Anyways, ""Horse Rotorvator"" is the anti Depeche Mode. It's a truly gothic work. None of the makeup and glam, but just the death and atmosphere. And it doesn't sound horribly dated for a nearly 20 year old album."
5,Muito bom!!,"Clássico da musica do mundo, da Jamaica, dos povos!!!Isso é vida.Todos precisam ouvir pelo menos uma vez!!Perfeito."
5,In this ah concrete jungle...,"As other reviewers have said, this is classic Wailers (not originally released as ""Bob Marley & The Wailers""). The only dilemma you have is whether to buy this one or the ""Deluxe"" edition with the jamaican versions of the songs. If you're like me and LOVE EVERYTHING by Bob Marley, you'll want the deluxe ed. If not, this one will do."
5,"This is a great, great cd!","First off all the Unrealesed version is awesome. It has slightly different versions of the ones on the original album, but all the songs are great. There are two songs on the Unrealesed album that are not on the original album. Hide Tide, Or Low Tide, and All Day, All Night. There both great songs and should have been on the original release. Overall the two albums are excellent. My favorite of Bob Marley. And i'm a HUGE Bob Marley fan. So buy this album. You WONT regret. Because Bob Marley is a LEGEND."
1,Not what I wanted,Really should specify that this is a compact disc an not a vinyl. Really disappointed that I have to go through the trouble of returning it and getting the right thing when two letters could have saved me the trouble.
5,Well made,I am very pleased with this rake. It's sturdy and the shape of the tines do a great job grabbing leaves without having to use a lot of pressure that tears up the lawn like my previous metal and plastic rakes. It's good to find a product that is both functional and made out of something renewable like bamboo.
1,Didn't do the trick,"I thought I had found what I wanted which was a bamboo rake that was reliabile based on the reviews. However when I recieved it, one of the two metal side hinges was missing (you can see them if you look closely at the rake picture soomed in). I jury rigged something to keep the last bamboo rod solidified, and tested it out. The middle bamboo rodes moved every which way after just a few rakes. It didn't appear to be due to the side metal hinge missing, it just appeared to be due to the bamboo rods not being the quality of the prior bamboo rakes that we had at the house which lasted many, many years, and though a ton of abuse as well. I'm happy to reply to comments, but this rake did not do the truck for me."
4,Bamboo Rake,"I purchased this rake to use on my artificial grass since the metal ones are a bit harsh. Although I still need to be careful, I am very pleased with the results."
3,An oh-so-black comedy,"I purchased this because of the rave reviews on Amazon and because I loved Aykbourn's brilliant The Norman Conquests. But this film, while it has its moments, is a studiously black comedy that doesn't come off. It works too hard at being completely off the wall, and ultimately disappoints. It's just mayhem, designed to draw laughs. Well, it does, but only occasionally. (Imagine playing Count Basie at the expiration of a villain. That's Mel Brooks country.) Yes, Helena Bonham Carter is an excellent actress. But it's all so contrived, complete with a wink at the camera at the end. Save your money."
4,Great.. except for one thing...,"The spline drive nuts have a washer seat. This is a GREAT feature since it helps to ensure proper torque (since the lug won't get caught up on the wheel,) and a damage-free installation.The locks, however, do not include this feature...and it makes zero sense to me. When asked via email, McGard never replied.I'd still buy them since they're the best on the market, but what the hell McGard?"
1,wash n dispose,"Wash it once and it fades,snags,and buttons fall off. Also this color looks like the draperies in a cheap 1950s motel. Get the Izods instead."
3,kind of itchy and runs small,"runs small can be overcome, buy I find the shirt a little itchy. Nice stylish shirt though. Perhaps a few washes will help."
5,excellent book,"This is an excellent book about the early American occupation of the Philippines; it is scholarly, thorough, informative and impassioned."
4,Get up & go!,Great energetic sound track to a funny movie that's unfortunately getting hard to find! This CD arrived so quickly I was amazed! And in great shape.
5,Best speakers I have ever owned.,"Granted I have not owned any really expensive speakers in my life, but I have listened to a lot. These speakers have a sub-woofer, two woofers, a midrange and a tweeter and they sound very well balanced with good separation and a lot of power. I am enjoying them very much. They make me appreciate music that is well performed and the above average singing voices. Worth the money. KB"
3,Missing parts but works good,Tripp Lite PR3/UL 3-Amp DC Power Supply 120VAC Input to 13.8VDC OutputThis power supply arrived with the insulator nuts for the terminals missing. In my case this was not essential as i discard them anyway but does show a lack of quality control at Tripp Lite. The unit works well and delivers a consistent DC power source at 13 volts. Works well with the electronic RFID readers i am powereing with it with negligable radio interference.
3,Hot Wire Foam Cutter?,"Look,I'm thinking about buying this, but want to know if it will work for a Hot Wire Foam Cutter.13 Volts output dosen't seem much, you think maybe it can be up'ed?"
2,Too Broad to be Used - Pro or Novice,"For the past month, I have been obsessed with learning all I could about Bass fishing. Growing up a Trout fisherman, the techniques used to catch bass seem like a whole other world. After exhausting online databases of articles, tips and pointers, I ordered this book along with several others. Although I have only a few actual bass fishing outings to draw upon, compared to the other books I have read, this one provided me with very little of use. For beginners, it is too broad - lacking the elementary details useful for those just learning the art of bass fishing. For those with more experience, there is little that is valuable or helpful to take your fishing to the next level. For newbies, I'd recommend Bass Wisdom."
1,Warning!,"For those hoping to find a translation of Pausanias, this isn't it. It is a collection of essays about Pausanias.I haven't read it yet, so my rating is based solely on my disappointment that it is not what I was expecting. I imagine I'll still enjoy the essays, but I was really hoping for the actual work itself."
4,GO exercise with the Teletubbies,"Finally a video that gets my son to drop his juice and get up and MOVE! From the minute this video begins he is jumping and dancing with the teletubbies. Each teletubby does there own movements (up & down, side to side etc.) and my son follows along. The music can be a bit annoying at times (especially since we HAVE to watch this video over and over and over). But all in all you end up liking these little creatures."
5,Granddaughter was so happy!!!,This is something my granddaughter wanted for Christmas but most places I found it wanted way too much money for it. Then this one came up on Amazon as a new one at a very reasonable price. my granddaughter was beyond excited when she opened it on Christmas morning. Thank you.
3,Very Slow Moving,"This is VERY slow paced, especially at the beginning. It starts out with exercises, repeating each exercise. Then it moves on to the song HEAD SHOULDERS KNEES AND TOES sung in different ways. Then it moves on to kids and Teletubbies copying each other.All in all, it is not a bad video, but it's not as charming as the tv program. My eight month old seems to enjoy it though, especially the parts with the Teletubbies. It is too long for him to sit through, so I usually have it on while he plays."
5,Blues Heaven,"I bought this album when it was first released in '69, probably because of the spacey cover. It was the sixties after all. No sooner did I pop it on my turntable than I discovered it is an extraordinary, awesome blues masterpiece. Every song is just soooo good. Back in the sixties, there were musical enhancement technologies <g> that I just don't use any more. So it was a real delight to rediscover this old friend, and to learn that the music sounds just as good, if not better than ever. This is one album that passes the test of time. The baritone voice of Chris Youlden is at its best. Kim Simmond's guitar licks are priceless. (I'm finally, after all these years, making some progress on learning them.) If you like Clapton or BB King, or John Mayall, or Peter Green or Canned Heat , then you will LOVE this album."
4,Well Assembled and Complete,This product was exactly what it claimed to be: enough survival supplies for a person to get by for a weekend during an emergency situation.
3,Not his best book,"I found this book to be somewhat tedious, unlike his last book which was very entertaining. It seemed as though Miller is just going through the motions on this book, and lost some of his humor."
1,"Dennis Miller, Comedian.....R.I.P.","Dennis Miller used to have an edge to his work; he was always attacking those in power and made no apology for it. Now, with his recent and self-serving conversion to Bush and his brand of conservatism, he has become a voice for the elite. A comedian can be right-wing (he just might not be as funny), but recent appearances have demonstrated that as he has moved to the right, his comedy has dropped off and his political rhetoric (sans wit) has increased. I am sure his switch was motivated most of all by a resentment of paying taxes (a common thing for former liberals), but at this time, more than ever, we need dissent -- preferably angry dissent -- not fawning defense of the powers that be."
1,cheaper than toilet paper at 48 cents,It's nice to see that this book has found it's price point. Dennis Miller is about as funny as colon cancer. Someone outta put a rubberband around this guys head so it'll shrivel up and fall off.
1,Can liberals start a boycott too?,"After hearing about all of the right wing hicks boycotting the albums by the Dixie Chicks, I can't help but wonder...After Dennis Miller's fawning praise of the president, and mindless endorsement of the war, can his intelligent, liberal-leaning former fans invoke the same response to Miller's betrayal?"
3,Drawing pads,"I have to laugh because as I gave it as a gift, all the pages were used up in a week. Good value for use."
5,Wonderful,The best thing about this product was how fast I got it! Second best was the quality. Best drawing pads I have ever had!
5,Great Value Pack!!,"Art Alternatives provide excellent sketchbooks and drawing pads. I had the hardcover sketchbook in high school and it was excellent. This pack is worth it! The hardcover, by itself, cost me $15 in high school, and that was the price for one in a class bulk set. If you're looking for a few good sketch books, You won't regret this buy."
4,Serviceable,The numbers and the value matched well. Gave it to the only artist in the family to sharpen his skills and consider a future in the wonderful world of art.
1,out-dated sci-fi,"Although this is considered a classic of its time (1953), it is very dated. Some of the reference to peepers and jumpers become corny after a while."
4,Super Reader,"In The Demolished Man, society goes for the Doc Savage school of rehabilitation of criminals. i.e. they alter their brains and minds until they are good productive citizens. Telepaths can generally notice when crimes will be committed beforehand.Here, a clever supervillain type is at large, and has a plan to change things. A man must try and stop him."
5,"Original, creative, and groundbreaking...","... isn't that what good sci fi is all about?? ""The Demolished Man"" broke new ground in it's description of telepathic abilities and describes them in some unique ways. Of course, fans of Babylon 5 will recognize the influence this book had on that show's Psi Corps. The book is a quick, fun, and an engaging read. It creates a telepathic universe that the reader never gets bored with exploring. A must read for any fans of the sci fi genre!"
4,A founder of Sci-fi.,"Many reviewers tell of the plethora of new and interesting ideas in this novel, which was ground breaking for 1951. Yes, the ideas are still fresh but, as has been pointed out, there are many holes in the ideas concerning Espers (a new evolution of mindreading humans). Put that aside and you have a great early sci-fi novel that rivals that of Asimov or any other of their contemporaries and a pretty good mystery to boot.A part of the book that impressed me was that the climax was strung out for such a long duration. For the last one-hundred pages I kept thinking that there could not possibly be more, but Bester surprised me again and again.I highly recommended this for those looking for their Sci-fi roots."
5,How it would be in the world of telepaths,"I read this book recently and I was furious. Because I hadn't read it sooner!! Why aren't you reading it right now? Call yourself a sci-fi buff??Seriously, I was blown away at how immersive Bester's (thanks JMS, for honoring the author with your Babylon 5 psi-cop) novel about telepath culture and aberrant murder could be. Clever use of word structuring to signify telepath thoughts, intriguing characters, and deep issues of morality and what the world might be like if telepaths emerged. Superb."
5,Thank you Amazon for spreading the word,"I would never have come across this masterpiece if it had not been for the sci-fi letter from amazon.com. This book is the Best beginning for the Hugo awards. The charecter development is rich and enticing, the interplay between the psy. cop and the demolished man is magnificent and Bester's imagination takes you where no one has gone before (without leaving the solar system). Enjoy."
2,How Dissappointing.,"The first half of the book was pretty good, developing a vivid and gritty futuristic world where telepaths are a part of the human population. It follows a donald-trump type top business man who plans to kill his rival in order to 'rule the world' (as usual). This may sound dry, but it starts off pretty interestingly. Thats when things go downhill, for the main character and for the reader. The plot gets lame and corny in the second half of the book, not to mention patronizing. The telepath hero seduces a much younger woman, sends his current admirer packing, stops the business man from ruling the world, and in the end the hero and villain become friends. Say what??? The horrendous ending really makes the whole book not worth reading."
3,Good but not perfect,"I am not surprised to find many readers grant 5 stars to this book, because this book really gets some interesting ideas even it is written many years ago. However, I think the main background of this book is pretty native or superficial. This book described a future society where many people with certain super ability can make that society nearly perfect. I surely suspect that point. There is no technique can be used only for good or for bad. There is no reason to believe that bad guys like Church and Tate are so rare among the group of Esper. Also, the world is tender to balance. Whenever there is something new, should have something against it. Like new locks will inspire thieves to invent new break in techniques. The research of blocking peeping should be a very important topic if in a world with so many peepers. Therefore, the plan of Reich looks too simple and unbelievable."
3,Second Bester,"After a brilliant read of ""The Stars My Destination,"" I was curious to read this title. ""The Demolished Man"" takes murder investigation into a futuristic direction that includes Telepaths, Mind Readers, and Brain Peepers with a surprise ending. ""Demolished Man"" is a game of cat and mouse between cop and murderer - where cop needs to get the proof & find a witness in order to put the murderer away, while the murderer tries to keep one step ahead of the cop. Personally, it was a tough followup read to ""The Stars My Destination."" ""Demolished Man"" is still a worthy addition to any book collection and should probably be read first before reading ""The Stars My Destination"" - which I plan to read over and over again."
3,Not Bester's Best.,"Not Bester's Best. Written in 1951, The Demolished Man is actually a murder, suspense novel set in the distant future. The fairly weak plot has the main character, (an industrialist) murder his corporate opponent, even though no one has gotten away with a murder in 70 years. The reason is simple, the police prefect and a small but important segment of the population have ESP. The police prefect ""cheats"" and reads our killer's mind, thus confirming he is guilty, but then must spend 75% of the story coming up with non-ESP proof, because apparently ESP is not admissible in court. Anyway, the whole story was rather preposterous with a number of flaws. I daresay Demolished would not even still be in print if not for Bester's other work The Stars My Destination which is nearly perfect."
1,Big disappointment,"Save some money and read the real reviews of this book elsewhere online before buying. Why?- The book contains nothing not already covered in Apple's own documentation - and THEY DO A BETTER JOB.- No scripting of 3rd-party applications is included.- It is not readable at all, beyond tedious.- Other problems: it is verbose and dry.- The only value the book has is providing syntax for the typical AppleScript core command set."
2,Impossible to find anything,"A co-worker gave me this book since I'm doing some Applescript work, and I must say, my frustration level just goes up every time I open it. I'm having more luck finding information on the web than I am in this book. The index is very poorly edited, and seems to be missing a lot of functionality.The book feels like a rush job and just isn't ready for prime time."
1,Useless,"A second nomination for worst O'Reilly book ever. Mistakes, confusion and just bad information are plentiful in this title by someone who knows nothing about AppleScript clearly. Why did O'Reilly pick this author to write the book when experts exist? Most all other of their titles are written by known authorities in their field - Bruce Perry is NOT an AppleScript authority."
1,Worst ever O'Reilly book,"This book is beyond dreadful. Admittedly, AS is a mess anyway, with no clearly defined central concepts and a syntax that makes Macromedia's Lingo look good. The book itself has no idea who its audience is. If it is for beginners, then comparisons with Perl, C++ etc, are useless.For an example of the editing, look at Table 4-1. How quickly can you make sense of it ? Tip - ignore the columns.O'Reilly books are generally great, and the Nutshell series are designed for quick access to information. There is room for a good O'Reilly AS book, but this isn't it."
1,Rewrite it O'Reilly! Keep your good rep...,What happened here?O'Reilly usually has SUCH good books - this is not one of them. Looks like the author could have used some help on this subject matter... A rewrite is in order if O'Reilly really wants to prove to Mac users that it cares about the platform. I mean AppleScript is the only truly native language to the Mac.
2,Sort of a waste of time...,"This cd, is just ok. It is nothing to write home about. Darek Smith isn't who to listen to for high musicianship, but if you must, go ahead and buy it, only if you are a die hard fan, this is not his best work(but than again what is?). I gave this two stars for effort only, it really only should get one, for quality(or rather lack of) of music. Skip this one, save your money for better things, try Dave McKenna instead."
1,dork eyes,"This guy is joking right, or is he for real??? Let's see it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this cd is bad. Just take a listen and see if you don't throw up your lunch. I'll pass on this one thank you very much,"
1,A truly stupid cd,"This is the worst cd I've ever heard, too bad the songs are so dumb, and the msuic sucks, why on earth this was ever released is beyond me. Let's brainstorm, it doesn't take a rocket scientest to figure it out. It's just plain unromantic crap. Anyone who likes this doesn't have a brain in thier head. Stay away from this awful cd. A can truly not recommend this cd, it should NOT have ever been released."
1,Not worth your time...,"""Full Clip"" is essentially an urban remake of the classic Western, ""Shane"", starring Busta Rhymes, Xzibit, and other Hip Hop performers. Obvious Question #1: Can you remake a classic Western with rappers and make it good? Yes. Obvious Question #2: Did they do it here? No. Not even close. ""Full Clip"" looks cheap, sounds cheap, and was cheap. Having worked on this film, I know that the production company spent as little as possible to get this thing finished, with most of the money going to pay Busta and his posse. (There are still several crew members who never got paid for their work on this film.) That sad note aside, ""Full Clip"" does have a few bright spots: Busta Rhymes creates a suitably viable anti-hero, while Xzibit impresses with his passion and believability. Additionally, several of the supporting actors also gave watchable performances. Other than that, ""Full Clip"" is a shoddy piece of film making that, despite the crew's best efforts, is simply not worth your time."
2,"""Full Clip"" Review","Rappers Busta Rhymes and Xzibit play former soliders who join forces once again to take down corrupt cops in a small town. This low-budget ""hip-hop Western"" also features Spliff Starr, Tommy ""Tiny"" Lister, Bubba Smith, Prodigy of Mobb Deep, and Wyclef Jean as the narrator. Busta and Xzibit do a decent job with their acting but the dollar store production value, comic book style of storytelling, and lack of any veteran acting talent keep ""Full Clip"" from being anything more than another cheap straight-to-video rap star vehicle."
3,Better than Expected,"I thought this film was a lot better than most films with a rapper as the main actor. From the cover this film seemed as if it was trying to appeal to Busta Rymes and Xzibit fan base more than anyone else, but they hold their roles good and the acting doesn't warrant most hip hop actors. It has a good story with elements of comedy sprinkled in to give this film in my rating 3/5. More dialouge and action would had made this film a real winner, but you can only get so much from actors whose main career is rapping."
2,Too small to be useful,"I read other feedback that this was small, but I couldn't imagine that it would be this small.The basket gets full with two baby towels in the hamper. I was hoping to get a hamper that would allow me to at least have 3 days of dirty clothes before having to do laundry, but this isn't it.The design is very cute, and it matches our tropical seas theme in the room, but this will not be the only hamper due to its small size."
4,Can't charge while in case,"This case cover is nice in looks, but it's design has one flaw, you can not charge it while it is in the case, they did not leave enough room to fit the connector...defeating it purpose!"
1,Aweful,"I was looking for an ipod and this is what i got was a cover not happy. One of the reviews said what you see is what you get. and thats what i thought i was getting, never any more electronics......"
2,Look Out for the Shipping Costs!,"This was for my daughter's @ Gen Nano. It was cheap but the shipping costs more than the case. What a rip off, Amazon!"
5,A Raw Sound,The final statement by The original Wailers was probably there best. With this they strayed away from aminstream American music to a rootsy simple style. The most legendary album of the Marley/Tosh/Livinston era.
3,Just starting,"I've always been a fan of great music but I'm 30 and somehow always passed by Marley's music. Last week I had 10 dollars to blow and was tired of almost all the music in my collection and bought ""Legend"" Wow It blew me away, I had never heard anything so perfect, it is all I want to listen to now. I came to the decision I must have more Marley, ""Get up stand"" up is my favorite song on legend so I bought this album. I'm hoping this album grows on me, but for now it seems it maybe more for the die hard fans. I like ""Burnin and Lootin"" ""One Foundation"" and I acctually have the Remaster copy with the bonus tracks and I love ""Reincarnated Souls"" and ""No Sympathy"" so If you are going to buy this album I strongly suggest buying the remastered copy."
3,ashaNTI TRIES TO rock out,not bad ashanti goes for the bad girl image on here I think van hunt doers the guitar solo i like hard rock but the guitar solo was'nt wild enough she should have called michael funkadelic hampton to get maggot brain ondatazz.
4,Misleading,This music on the disc is good but I just want to state that this particular order on Amazon.com is misleading. When you order this edition with 5 bonus tracks you really get sent the original album without the extra tracks. I feel scammed! (...) It was a little suspicious that the original album sans the extra tracks cost more than the bonus edition. Amazon must have made a mix-up of the two editions.
5,Satisfying read!,"This is the story of Celia Murray forced into the business world by the death of a relative. Although this a frequent theme of Ms Hill, one she was well acquainted with, I found this book appealing. Celia lived in a dismal boarding home with strangers, where she and the other inhabitants really were a victim of their circumstances. The meals were dreadful and unappealing. Even the landlady's inability to manage money and her own feelings of hopelessness were skillfully woven into the story. Celia receives a small inheritance, brings her Aunt and an old servant to live with her and they begin a modest makeover of the boarding house that touches and brightens the lives of all who live there. The romance is understated but satisfying. I confess a love for books or movies that show one person making the difference for even one. so this review is biased."
4,David Guetta - Just A Little More Love,"Sometimes, you don't want to think -- you just want some good dance music. And David Guetta delivers just that on JUST A LITTLE MORE LOVE. From the club-favorite title track onwards, there's no stopping the groove. A bit of 80s nostalgia infects these tracks, but not in a way that overwhelms or feels too retro. Barbara Tucker lends her powerhouse lungs to ""Give Me Something (Deep in My Heart),"" a solid house effort. The tracks here are short and easily digestible, made more for home listening than for club play, but a few gems still stand out: the aggressive chant of ""It's Allright (Preaching Paris)""; the nouveau disco of ""People Come People Go""; the filtering of David Bowie on ""Just For One Day (Heroes)""; or the mellow tones and sax of ""You Are the Music."" My personal favorite, however, is ""Distortion,"" with its dark rhythms, acid line and the brooding recording-booth voice. Go ahead and dance. You know you wanna."
5,Get it while you can...,"The product review about says it all. A meld of Beatles, or maybe more like Badfingfer, and T-Rex Glam power pop, but it is definitely a statement on it's own. This album's well thought out and musically diverse tracks will keep you from getting bored with it anytime soon. Lots of great ideas. Eric Dover is a veteran of Jellyfish, Slash's Snakepit and was Alice Cooper's guitarist. A real shame this album is not better known. This 1996 cd can be had dirt cheap here in 2011. Get this brand new while you can and leave the uninformed masses behind where they belong."
4,"More glam, less jelly","This band unfortunately cannot be mentioned without uttering the word ""Jellyfish"". It's understandable... but yet very unfair. Jellyfish are arguably one of the most underrated bands ever. Imperial Drag are more straight ahead glam rock with clever lyrics. It rocks... just enjoy it for what is and don't expect a 5 star masterpiece like Spilt Milk."
4,The album Jellyfish should have made after Spilt Milk,"Although not as immediately catchy as the first two Jellyfish albums, Imperial Drag's self titled debut demonstrated the direction Jellyfish might have moved. Well, maybe not but regardless, this is a fine first and only album from ID. It would have seemed a natural direction for Jellyfish after the 5 star Split Milk.The songs are catchy with riffs worthy of any classic 70's rock album. In fact, some of the songs play almost as clever parodies of the genre. Regardless, this is a fine album. A pity that Andy Sturmer wasn't involved and that Jellyfish didn't record this album. It would have just added luster to an already outstanding reputation."
4,If you remember a time...,"Do you remember a time when bands actually had members who could play their instruments? You do, Weird, me too.If you're in your mid to late 30's and used to listen to rock music, you might just enjoy every second of this CD. There is no need for me to go further, the reviews I glanced over are pretty much right on the money, enjoy the music. This should be an easy selection to make (add to shopping cart) see there, that was easy. In a few days when you get this CD in the player you'll feel a whole lot better about music in general. Thank me later."
4,Crazy 70's sounds,"The Jellyfish veterans in this band successfully put together an album that smacks of Queen, the Beach boys, and other influences. I recommend this album whole-heartedly."
3,Not that bad...,"I bought this disc used for a buck 99 (+ tax). In truth, I only bought it because this is former Slash's Snakepit frontman, Eric Dover's band. While I was not overly impressed (ok, I wasn't actually ""impressed"" at all), I did find that after a few spins, a couple of tracks do grow on you (""Boy or a Girl"" and the very Zepplin-ish ""Overnight Sensation"").I don't feel I wasted my money. However, had I paid full price, I'd probably be feeling somewhat differently. I do recommend giving it a try, assuming you can find it for under $2.50."
3,Interesting but turgid,Interesting but really wordy in getting the point across. Because it was written so long ago the format is so wordy instead of just laying out the point it walks around it circling it instead of just saying it.
5,Great Price Guide,"I have found this to be a very comprehensive price guide. It was refered to me by a long time collector and I am not disappointed. I have been using it for a year now and it has been a great companion to ""Roseville in All it's Splendor"" The prices are not always 100% on the mark but I feel that it is closer then others on the market. And it fits in my purse ;)"
1,it's so sad,"If you love Polydistortion like me, you are in for a big disappointment with this one. This doesn't even sound like Gus Gus, it sounds like a high school electronic band playing with their newly bought keyboards. Simple beats, simple music... Every bad song on this CD makes me think of every good song on Polydistortion and that makes it even worse. I have the remix record of Desire which is not too bad but the original version on this CD is just mediocre.The Gus Gus dynasty may be over folks. Rest In Peace Gus Gus..."
1,I waited 4 years for THIS?,"When I first heard Polydistortion, I was in heaven....Then I waited and waited for This Is Normal to come out, and then again I was in heaven (Even more so...one of my all-time favorite albums) and then I had to wait 4 years (i still have yet to hear the vs. album) for this horrid, rancid, piece of tripe. But I was skeptical anyway, seeing as how they have moved to the MOONSHINE label of all things ( I mean...come on...home of Keoki and John Digweed? Give me a break!) I mean, even for the raver bullsh*t techno that Moonshine is famous for, this is a REALLY REALLY bad album. The beats sound more primative than early Alien Sex Fiend drum machines (Even though I do like Alien Sex Fiend), and the overall simplicity of this album is stomach-churning. SO, GUSGUS FANS ACROSS THE GLOBE - ATTENTION! THIS ALBUM BLOWS! I feel bad for writing such a negative review for one of my favorite bands, but THEY should feel bad for putting their fans through this sort of nausea!"
2,"Disappointed, but still a Gus Gus fan","When I read Gus Gus had a new album, I was excited. Unfortunately, I have been disappointed. Most of songs sound amateurish, almost like a house music parody. I applaud them for trying some new sounds, but this album's sound is very ""cold"" and lacks that classic Gus Gus groove we love. For a richer, more organic sound, I recommend Gus Gus' earlier album ""Polydistortion""."
2,Ugh ugh..,"Plain and simple, after Polydistortion and This is Normal the bar is set high. Gus gus missed by a mile. The most dissapointing CD I have ought all year."
2,Dissapointing at best,"I was extremely disapointed with this cd. In fact, I consider it the worst cd I've purchased all year.Gusgus' intentions were good in trying new sounds and trying to redefine themselves after the demise of trance, but the results are amateur at best. The timing is sloppy, the arrangements are dull, the tracks are poorly mixed, and the hihats clip on a couple of the tracks (listen to Your Moves are Mine if you don't believe me). It's painful to listen to squishy uncompressed drums but even worse to hear the snares not even hitting in time with the bass drum. There are seriously at least 50 technical problems with this album. This could all be overlooked if the damn thing had a decent groove or some sort of drive, but I never felt the desire to boogie even once through the entire cd."
5,GOOD THINGS COME TO THOSE THAT WAIT...,"If electronic music can get any better than ATTENTION then... it must be heaven like! I'm already above cloud 9 with some serious breakbeats, deep house and some freash electroclash sounds on what I think is GUSGUS most stylish, well thought and crafted work till today, think about it as Giorgio Moroder meets Deee-Lite.From start to end the sounds and beats develop from soft to deep to hard. Tracks # 3,4,5,6 & 7 are by far the best tracks and ""Your Moves are mine"" will make even DISCO song ""Love to Love You Baby"" sound PG13.For the first time the lyrics are more people like and more soulful and Udur's voice is just amazing!"
5,can you take it,"Want to dribble left handed with strength, shoot with strength. This is it. Don't over do it but use it 30 min every other day and every day for passing. Big problem is finding someone to use it with."
3,Lush with a tech edge,"Gideon's Fall: When You Dont Have a Prayer, Only a Miracle Will DoIn tone it reminded me of tower of glass. A more tech feel to it than most silverberg's but still had the lushness that is silverberg's hallmark. Think of that..."
3,"Not Silverberg's best, but not bad","This book has the writing style of the author going for it, which is always a plus, but this is not Silverberg's best work. The central characters are fairly well developed, and the scenario of a ""greenhoused"" earth is convincingly depicted, but the story itself is rather episodic and ultimately has no really profound point to make. A good, but not great read."
2,This Left Me Dazed & Confused,"This was my first E. L. Doctorow book, and will probably be my last. I read 57 pages, and nearly every page was a confusing and tedious slog. Actually, considering how much I re-read trying to discern what exactly was happening, I probably read about 75 pages. I'm not sorry I put it down...comparing it to beating your head against a wall and how good it feels when you stop. It was like several unrelated stories spliced together. There was little meaningful punctuation which added to the confusion. Bad poetry was injected for no discernable purpose. The whole thing felt like stream-of-consciousness meanderings by someone on drugs. Doctorow jumped from one character and scene to another for what I could only determine was an concerted effort to be mysterious and erudite. Please spare me the self-important on the planet."
4,"Challenging Read, for sure...","I love World's Fair and Ragtime and have read them several times each. This book is different in that there are what I would call stream-of-consciousness sections that just run in with no punctuation kind of like I'm writing here to give you an idea of it, and also there are some sections of poetry interspersed throughout (I'm not a big poetry reader, myself.)If you can get past all that, it's a good story that follows an failed poet and a young drifter and how their lives intersect. As someone else said in their review, I'd give this 5 stars, except for the literary anomalies, which knock it down to 4. Can't blame the author for trying something different..."
1,It Made Me Think I'd Lost MY Mind!,"This was one of the most maddening books I ever had the misfortune to waste my money on.Yes, it was challenging. In fact, challenging is an understatement. Loon Lake was the first book I ever gave up on before getting even halfway through. I had absolutely no idea what was going on and, after a while, I simply did not care anymore.I highly recommend that you go to the library and borrow this book to see whether or not it's for you before purchasing it!"
2,A prose poem or a novel?,"Doctorow ""not"" as his finest. Difficult to read as a long run-on sentence. Unusual not to love Doctorow, but I have put this novel down after every few pages."
2,Capsule strength is misleading,"This Nature's Way product contains a ""Phophatidylserine Complex"" of which only 100 mg is phosphatidylserine. An interesting advertising ploy."
3,Range is limited,"Excellent seller with very fast shipping! Got it for a great price, but would not recommend this product. Got it for our laptop to take on vacation to Florida to keep up with email. No matter where we were we had a difficult time picking up a wireless connection."
4,Upgraded,"I upgraded from an older, slower Linksys card. This item provided the faster response that was looking for."
1,Does not work on HP,This unit has locked up my computer every time it is plugged in. I have to unplug from the 120v and remove the battery. Of course I have discarded the packaging so I an out the return. It started locking up on a game and the last time it locked up when trying to access the net. Seems that no matter what is used it does not like it. I have tried not using the Linksys connection but that does not work either.
1,Very limited distance,"Wanted to return but no luck,so used it ones and it still laing in original box unused."
2,Does not delivery what they advertize,"I tested this product in a compaq 2100US laptop. I Compared the reception to a built in Intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG Network connection in a DELL Inspirion 6000. The Linksys card had better range and signal strength than the internal wireless had, but not the advertized 10X faster and 3X farther. It kept the connection at 56K over a longer range but retrieving the web pages over the extended distance was like being on dialup. It was worth the $26.97 price I paid but I would not pay top buck for this product."
2,Not my favorite wireless adapter,"I'm using Linksys Wireless-G routers with SRX400 with no problems whatsoever, but this particular notebook adapter caused nothing but problems. I could not boot any laptop with it inserted in the adapter slot. If I left it in the adapter slot and booted, the laptop froze. I had no problems inserting and using once the laptop was already started, but who wants to pull out an adapter every time you shutdown? Linksys wasn't much help getting it fixed and at the time I wasn't going to wait for new drivers to come out so I ditched it for the wireless-g USB adapter and have had no problems since."
2,There no wireless connection for me....,I bought this product after I look at all the reviews about. I decided to get one for my HP laptop. I pop in the cd to do the step by step process. After that I try to connect to the network and no network was in range. The Linksys Power and Link doesen't light up when it said it was active!! It only blink twice and nothing more. I dislike this product I just waste my money for nothing! =/I voted for 2 stars because the mailing system is good it shipped within 3 days....
2,Large Size - Small Signal,"I purchaser this card to pick up WiFi signal in my area. I installed this card, which advertises ""Range eXpansion,"" in a DELL Latitude and only get 8 - 10% on the signal which is insufficient to connect to the internet. My 9 inch Asus Eee PC picks up a strong enough signal with its built in WiFi (side by side with the DELL) to easily connect to the internet. Given the size of this card I was expecting it to receive a better signal than the Eee PC mini notebook. The claim of ""Range eXpansion,"" is not accurate. I can only recommend this for close use to the wireless router.In any case I would not recommend this seller due to their return policy."
5,breakthrough new technology that works,Purchased this along with a new Linksys WRT54GX4 router (the latest from Linksys). The installation was easy. And most important the combination reached areas in my home that my old router could not even come close to. In fact I can now go to the barn (200ft away) and go on line. This new MIMO technology is great.
3,Could be more carefully constructed,They are pretty much as you'd expect. They're solidly but rather roughly made: the sides are a bit warped and don't line up perfectly when closed. That doesn't affect the function but it is quite noticeable.
3,For the serious error coin collector...,"If you are into error coins big time, this book is for you. The book has hundreds of different errors, saying how they were made and a general price. It is like a encyclepedia: many different general entries, not going to specific on any one type of error. If you are a begginner to numismatics I would not reccommend this. Instead you should go for something like the Redbook. However, if error coins are your expertise, this is a must buy."
4,Reliable products by this seller,I recieved the book in a timely manner and the book was in better shape than I had expected. Good job. Thank You.Sandy
2,There are better books on the subject,"I didn't care for this book for a few reasons. First, this really isn't a price book. Sure it gives very general prices but nothing really pinned down. Second, this book is very hard to just look up a specific coin. The book is not very well aranged. This would be a good book if you just wanted to know the different varieties and how they were made. So if that's what you want then that's what you will get. As far as a price guide forget it doesn't tell me much about the value of a coin, especially with no specific year of coin or denomination."
1,Fade-out ending?!,"One of the most memorable musical experiences I have is my first listening of Savoy Brown's Hellbound Train -- WITH the classic cut-off ending! Astounding.To change the ending is criminal.I bet the guy who made that decision is the same guy who came up with the truck back-up warning signals that can be heard a mile away.Thanks to other reviewers for the warning, I won't spend money on this edition. I'll keep my worn-out vinyl copy."
1,A bad ending to good music,"I bought this new in shrink wrap on July 7, 2007, thinking by now they had fixed the ending to Hellbound Train. Nope. It still fades out. The CD I bought had ""Deram"" in a red box on the front graphic in the upper right corner with 844 019-2 under it. It was nice to hear the rest of his fine album after so many years, but I'm returning it. I refuse to pay money for a truncated version of this album."
1,Ruined by faulty editing,"I was extremely happy when I found that this all time Savoy Brown classic had been put on CD. My vinyl copy had long since become virtually unplayable. I couldn't have been happier with the outcome until the last 30 seconds of the title track when, instead of the abrupt cutoff that ended the track on the vinyl edition, the CD version wimps out in a disgusting fade. Hellbound Train was SUPPOSED to end in that switched-off fashion. It was like the train had fallen off a cliff and you were in Hell and ain't no way you're comin' back! If I could meet the moron who did the editing for the CD version I'd . . .The rest of the recording is still great but the re-edit of the title track so detracts from the whole experience of the CD that I believe I'll play frisbee with it!"
2,3 good songs.the rest is filler.This follow up to SCT isn't,"Doin Fine, Hellbound Train, and IF I Could See An End are great .The rest is filler much like the filler Paul Raymond did with Chicken Shackon their fourth album."
3,"I agree with Roger, so if you want to hear it right...","The review from Roger Madison is 100% correct in his assessment of the ending of the CD when the title track ""Hellbound Train"" fades out rather than ends abruptly (like the shock you'd get arriving in Hell). So if you want to hear it done right, you can buy the 2 CD anthology ""The Savoy Brown Collection"" where it doesn't fade out.Post note: I had the pleasure of chatting with Kim Simmonds in 2003, after he put on a short acoustic set in a bookstore (I won't name it here!) in a local mall. Kim informed me that the CDs with the fadeout ending on Hellbound Train are actually no longer available and are somewhat of a collector's item. I haven't bothered to buy another copy to see if that's true... I don't recall the reason he gave for the fadeout ending, however I do recall that he had heard plenty of complaints about it, not that it was his fault."
4,Still strong after all these years,"There's something special about this album (I bought the vinyl when this first came out), and I return to it all these years later. I would have given it three stars at the time, but now I like it even more. What I like about this version of Savoy Brown is the emphasis on songs for side one, fat keyboards and a de-emphasis on guitar solos. I know some SB fans like the blues stuff of earlier days, like the first review above. But I find the Hellbound Train constantly intriguing."
5,In my own thoughts I felt...,"This book is truely amazing. I cannot express all of my feelings towards it. To flip through the pages of Homesick and read of all of Sela's discoveries, embarkments, and life alterments was none other than exciting. I had known ""of"" Sela from ""Once and Again"" and from some of her movies but this book showed me more. It is probably hard to really describe one's life in a book, including describing one's own life, but Sela tackled the task and completed it. It's a book that no one, who is a fan of Sela, could skip reading, let alone put down for a second, while reading. I never stopped. True essence at heart."
2,"Fine for fans, others... not so much","Someone who is a fan of the author's acting gave me a copy, raving about its charms. If you've followed Ms. Ward's career, you'd probably like this book, as it has a chatty just-between-friends feel. If, like me, you don't really know who she is, you might be more likely to have a ""ho hum"" reaction. A lot of reminiscences and reflections are shared, but in a superficial way that makes it feel more like a marketing tool than a real piece of writing. For example, the author comments on the dilemma of whether to raise her children in the Jewish faith of her husband or in her own Christian tradition. This issue is resolved breezily when a pastor says one can worship just as easily in a synagogue as a church. Voila, problem solved, no fuss, no muss, no internal struggle or philosophical debate..."
2,Proceeds go to a good cause...,"and that alone is a very good reason to buy this book. As a read, it is fluffy and short but if you are a Sela Ward fan, you won't be disappointed. There are beautiful pictures of Sela and her family,and she even takes pot shots at rivals of her past (don't haze beautiful club inductees-they may become movie stars and gut you in a book), but she still somehow never really commits herself to the book, or to moving back to her hometown.She does provide an evening of peeking into her somewhat ""sugar frosted"" upbringing, which is light and airy and a quick read. A portion of the proceeds from the book go to support Hope Village, a home for abused and neglected children in Mississippi. This alone makes this book a great gift. It's also a good book for someone who wants something light and quick."
2,Broke!,The blow dryer is perfect size for my bathroom. I was very happy until one day it just started actibg funny and then it just wouldn't turn out. Now I have to figure out if I can get a refund. Waste of money!.......and time!
4,Treadmill review,"Very easy to put together...only about 1/2 hour. Delivery from company wasn't flexible with times. So far, so good with quality of machine."
5,Glides,"This is such a nice treadmill. There are so many positive features-the weight capacity, shock absorbers, display, different positions. I enjoy using it. The only thing I wish it had was a mat to go underneath it."
2,Just don't waste your time.,"I got this at the end of September used it for a week then had to have it serviced. That took a month to fix the problems. Been using now for over 6 months, now the buttons on my console aren't working. Trying to get a hold of tech support no luck yet."
4,beware,though at times written in a sophmoric manner(at times our author telegraphs) ..this book is a harrowing and psychologically astute portrayal of the unraveling of a young woman's psyche and identity...all the more chilling because the story is told in a matter of fact way that leads one to examine if what happens to the main character can possibly happen to the reader... people will emphatize and be haunted silmutaneously....this novel is well worth reading and may lead you to question your assumptions about you friends as well as yourself....
3,unlikable characters,the book has an interesting premise and could have some interesting twists and turns but the characters are unlikable. I had very little patience for either of the main characters. I found little to be redeeming about either one.
2,Horrible CD! One of the worst I own,"I would give Harper only 1 star but he at least has a cookin band backing him up which tries to cover for his lack of well....everything! His harp playing is too spuratic (for my tastes) throughout the CD and what he does play is very ""John Popper Like"" on most occasions. There isn't one song on here that jumps out at you. From 1 to 11 it's just more of the same. It's just what you'd expect from an Australian blues man. It's kinda like INXS meets Kevin Eubanks. This is the first review I've ever written but I just felt so ripped off I had to let it out. I don't think Harper new which direction he was going with this. One song on here is called ""I know"" and another is called ""I really don't know""...I couldn't agree more!"
4,My first center channel,"This is the 1st center channel and it really made a big difference at home. It is set up to work above or below you TV just by flipping it upside down. The voice and crisp highs can now be appreciated. At its price and paired up with the rti6's and fxi a4's and psw505 all from amazon, I got a great set up at a great deal. I payed half of what it would cost me at a retail shop and shipping is quick. Thanks Amazon."
5,Great center speaker,This speaker goes very well with Polk speakers in its price range. Sound is clear and balanced.
4,Nice Shoe. Great Performance,"Great shoe for indoor ball play. I have arch issues and there is nice support there. Not an ""everyday"" or fashion shoe though!"
5,Great reflexions and gives a clear pictura of it was to live in a communist country,Loved the way Nadia tells her story and how whe took the positive side of every situation. It's like a fairy tale !
5,Nadia scores another perfect 10,This is an amazing book.It is a deeply personal and detailed account of Nadia Comaneci's life by 'Little Miss Perfect' herself and offers a wonderful insight into what 'makes her tick'.I am reading it to my class of 9-11 year old students and they are similarly enjoying it too.I thoroughly recommend this book.
5,Classic Chipmunk,"A take off of Robocop, Alvin plays a street wise cop named Malone. He and his partner, Violet, (britany) are trying to clear the city of Mr.Pinkie's(Theodore) gang. Meanwhile, Dr.Simonize, (Simon) is building a robot for the mayor,(elenor) that will literally clean up the city. When his Robot fails, Simonize turns Malone in to a one robot police force.Buy it yourself to hear the rest."
1,Awful,"I am a diehard Elton John fan and to say the least, this album is awful. In their own right, these artists are very talented, but there was not one who did justice to Elton's songs. There was only one track I could somewhat listen to and that was the rendition Wilson Phillips made of Daniel. All artists belong in their own circle of signature songs and should stay there. If you are new to Elton's music, do not buy this album. I suggest you look elsewhere to find his orginal recordings."
2,Not a fitting tribute,"This isn't a fitting tribute album, there are a couple of tracks that merit an occasional listen, but as a whole this is a weak release. You'd be better off buying a couple of EJ's greatest hits CD's and skipping this all together."
3,Average Tribute To Elton John's And Bernie Taupin's Music,"Artistically, this isn't a great tribute to Elton John's and Bernie Taupin's songwriting talents, though there are a number of excellent covers. Leading the pack is Sinead O'Connor's haunting, indeed, mesmerizing, version of ""Sacrifice"". Almost as good is Eric Clapton's bluesy version of ""Border Song"" and Sting's cover of ""Come Down In Time"". The Beach Boys turn ""Crocodile Rock"" into one of their songs and The Who transform ""Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting"" into one of their rock anthems. Sadly, most of the rest is forgettable, with the exception of Bruce Hornsby's splendid piano playing and singing of ""Madman Across The Water"". If you are a diehard Elton John fan, you'll certainly want this CD."
3,MUSIC FANATIC,THE ALBUM WAS VERY SOOTHING I FOUND MYSELF LISTENING ALL THE TIME ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MUSIC
2,"2 Rooms, Elton Tribute","There are two stellar tracks on this compilation, Eric Claptons' ""Boarder Song"" is what tribute tracks should be about, a completely different take on a classic, his vocals, production, backing tracks and solo are flawless! The other gem is Bruce Hornsbys' ""Madman Across the Water"" he takes advantage of all the great melody lines of the original, both vocally and instrumentally with a great jazzy feel."
3,This is a bit weak..,It works but I still have leaks. I had to reinforce the inner ring with some mighty putty type material in order for it to stop leaking.
3,"Good, but I have heard better","This is a very good CD that gives you good introduction to samba's sounds. The songs are well constructed and a lot of them are memorable. To my taste, however, I prefer more agressive samba that I have heard on other samples that use a faster rhythm."
5,The golden age of hard blues rock,"In the late 60's and early 70's, England was in the middle of a blues/hard rock obsession. Bands like Humble Pie, Free, Wishbone Ash, Ten Years After, Jeff Beck Group, Led Zeppelin, Trapeze and many more were playing the blues heavy and hard. Savoy Brown was right in the middle of it all. The hard boogie and blues rock on this album will let you know where real heavy metal came from. Kim S. was a great guitarist. Most of SB had left the same year to form Foghat, but Kim put together a steller new lineup, and made this classic. This is one of Savoy Brown's best LPs."
2,The luster left before this album,"I am amazed that this album has gotten such good reviews here. This starts Kim's long descent into his boogie demise. If you want to hear Savoy Brown at their finest and the music that gave them their acclaim, buy ""Looking In"" and ""Raw Sienna"". If you like the blues side of their music get ""Blue Matter"". But by the time this album came out, the magic was gone."
2,"A decent business book, a fraud","The book had it's good parts, sometimes inspiring. On the whole, it is an entertaining read with good insight on business and its ups and downs. I must say also, that to me it is a fraud. I shop at Home Depot often. I'll be damned if the service in the stores today is 1% as good as the authors (Marcus and Blank) describe it in the book. It's only proper that the founders would beat their chests about how great they are now, while HD itself detoriorizes from its former self. Don't get me wrong either, I shop there ... I'm a loyal customer. BUT I also know what HD USED to be like and it's definitely not the way it is now, the way it was described in the book. Hence, a fraud.So, if you want to know the ""how"", read the book. If you've ever been to a HD lately, don't read the book, it will just get you upset next time you walk into one of the stores."
1,Look at how great Home Depot is....,"This entire book is a self-serving description of how good the Home Depot is and how smart the founders (the authors of this book) of the company are in conducting business. Sure customer satisfaction is important to the success of any business but it would have been much more helpful to detail how this function was promoted, implemented, and monitored during Home Depot's tremendous growth stage. Rather, the reader is offered selected stories of how an associate in a store did something incredible for a customer. Additionally, the authors appear concerned with offering excuses for past instances when the company did something poorly (e.g., lawsuits, acquisitions). This book had all the ingredients for a good story; unfortunately the authors appeared more concerned with their own legacies rather than a true discussion of Home Depot's history and present functional strategies."
4,Inspiring read.,"I enjoyed this book very much. It was great to see how a dream can be realized by having the guts to push ahead and to do it honestly and morally. I catch myself, now, checking the customer service at Home Depot and at other businesses. I only wish that I had bought it sooner. It was written in 1999 and I can't help but wonder where they are, now."
3,Repetition Rules,"As a history of Home Depot, this book contains many interesting stories as well as interesting character descriptions. Where it fails is in the endless repetitions of the Home Depot philosophy, which follow each story and character description. At 315 pages, the book is too long. Careful editing would have allowed this book to be published at 250 pages without losing any meaningful content."
1,Full of Lies,"Let's face facts: home depot is known for abysmal service and really, really shoddy haphazard installations. They probably spend more on defending lawsuits than on store development. This book makes them look like such wizards, such brilliant and benevelont businessmen, when in fact they have done studies to see what the minimum level of customer service they can get away with is - and then tried to stretch that envelope.I am sure Ken Lay could write books full of accolades to Enron. It would be just as true, and just as much a waste of time and money to read."
1,Home Depot provides a horrible experience,"If you like wandering around with no service, ringing yourself out at the register, and watching a bunch of orange outfits ignore you, try Home Depot. The bigger the company gets, the more horrible the experience. Try True Hardware."
4,Great...Hard to put down once you start!,"Being a stock holder of The Home Depot, I was interested in seeing how it all got started. This book is great and really is hard to put down once you start! I give it 4 stars mainly because, as in other reviews, the authors do pat themselves on the back a little too much, but overall it is a must read!"
3,Cannon Printer Cartridge,"It works as expected, but there has not been time to determine how long it will last or its long term performance."
3,Not the same as the cast I saw,"I was somewhat disappointed that this was not the cast I saw. Therefore, the songs are sung a bit differently. If you enjoyed the show, and you are getting the CD because you liked the show, then be sure you are ok with different singers."
3,"Good concept, but not totally engaging","Alissa Quart tackles an admirable and potentially fascinating subject in Branded, yet I was left feeling a bit disappointed after finishing the book. I personally found her writing style a bit stilted, and it seems like there is a lot of information and many observations, yet not so much in-depth analysis. The book itself is not extremely long, so there is definitely room for more expansion. There are countless examples of teen branding in movies, fashion, magazines, advertisements, etc., and the author touches on all of these and more, but somehow the book felt more like a bombardment of information than a nuanced analysis. I had pretty high expectations when I read this book (especially from the many positive editorial reviews available), but it was ultimately not as satisfying an experience as I would have hoped."
5,Best Bob Marley Album Made,"Although not replete with hits like the preceding album, Exodus, Kaya is the Wailer's best album, better even than Catch a Fire. It is not full of strong political messages or deep Rastafarian chants, but rather it returns to capture the beauty of free-spirited, light hearted reggae tunes. Someone looking for deep, angry lyrics might not be satisfied, but if it's great sound you're looking for, this is the album. Somehow it always gets mediocre reviews, perhaps because it does not fulfill what people who listen to reggae expect of a political group like the Wailers. However, Marley has definitely not sold out, and songs such as Easy Skanking, Sun is Shining, She's Gone, Misty Morning, Time Will Tell, and Running Away are all some of his most delightful lost classics, and deserve far more credit than they get. The title song may very well be one of his best songs ever. This album is a must for everyone who enjoys reggae, or beautiful music period."
5,Gotta have Kaya now,"This is probably Bob Marley's best studio album. It is not as politicaly charged as the others, but is the quintesential album for relaxtion and just plain feeling good. There is no other greater artist than Bob Marley and this album is definete proof."
5,Precious memories,"Bob Marley is truly one of the greatest. My husband and I shared ""Kaya"" while traveling down the coast in California in a bright red convertible...""Sun Is Shining"" is my favorite. Years later, my son wrote an assignment for school and made reference to ""Sun Is Shining"" as being a song that ""describes how I feel about man's place on this Earth as being a part of it rather than a destroyer of it. The world is beautiful and it's great to be free."" I think my husband and Bob Marley would be proud. Shy"
3,"Nice little TV, but could use headset plug.","I used this TV for a monitor for my XBOX, but now use it to watch while on my treadmill, since getting an XBOX 360. I wish it had an audio out so I could use headphones. Not a bad deal for the price."
5,Nami Cheers Me Up!,I continue to be amazed at Nami's impressive dance tune and clear voice. And this tune is no exception; this upbeat tune sounds so positive and powerful it not only soothes me but also cheers me up. I often find her songs are often chosen as animation songs and that explains it because I suppose her songs animate especially Gundam freaks a lot. And every Nami's upbeat dance tune sound always positive and powerful. So I want her to continue this sort of style because she is a shining star for her fans. I feel like she always gives me a lot of fortunes whenever I enjoy this dance tune.
2,Iffy!,"The SkinTight cover is cool. Works pretty well with the unit, but the belt clip SUCKS! It's big and bulky and locks in over the mute switch on the Treo and it sometimes slides the mute switch over to mute or vise versa."
1,Better products available,"I was looking forward to the Speck rubberized cover with some excitement, however I was disappointed. While the cover fits very well it and may work in an industrial environment, after the first day it looks like it's two years old. If you have an SD card in your Treo forget it -- the belt clip will pop your card daily. And the belt clip itself is an afterthought easily sliding off your belt. Don't even think about putting the Treo in your pocket as the non-slip cover won't begin to slide into your pocket. Finally, the price at $32.95 is outrageous for a $5 cover. If you're in an industrial enviroment this may be your cover, but for the rest of us...keep shopping or buy insurance."
2,"Good Idea, Bad Execution","The skin is a great idea, but it is not practical. It is too thick to work with the Seidio Cradle I have, so I must pull off the skin to sync my Treo. The skin buttons do not always line up with the TREO buttons, so I misfire applications. The holster is a joke as it snaps over top the expansion card slot constantly ejecting the card every time I pull the phone off the holster. Do not place the phone in your pocket with the skin on unless you need to see the inside of your pocket liner as it will not come out cleanly!"
1,Piece of Junk,"The yarn does not catch the hooks. This toy was a big disappointment because it did not work properly. The crank is difficult to turn, even for an adult. Big piece of junk."
1,DITTO!!,"My review is exactly as the others! My daughter received this as a Christmas gift. She was very excited to use it. However, upon opening the box we found the plastic needle to be missing. After tracking down a needle at a craft store, I thought we were reading for business! WRONG! After only getting 1/4 of the way through a scarf the thing jammed up and would not turn in either direction. I didn't even bother to exchange it for another! As a side note, I have used the SINGER brand of the knitting machine and it works great! I made about 30 scarves so far with no problems. Good Luck!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this for my 8 year old daughter. While threading the yarn on to help her get started I turned the crank for 4 rotations and the machine broke. It wouldn't turn anymore. We boxed it up and took it back to toys R us and were going to get a replacement. They told us that they had returns on that product every day, and also on other ROSEART products in general, and suggested we take our money back. If the store suggests we take our money back, then that has to say something. I am thinking about getting the Singer Model instead, not sure, but this one was JUNK."
1,What a RIP-OFF!!,We didn't even get to finish more than 10 rows before the machine jammed! The yarn they provided was just a huge tangled mess that took me about an hour to unravel and make into a ball in hopes it would help the tension and thus eleviate drop stitches. Fat chance! I am taking this piece of junk back and will let my daughter pick out something else.
1,Buy knitting needles instead,"Don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk. I tried it while at a knit out and neither the crummy eyelash yarn included nor regular worsted weight yarn worked. It dropped stitches and it also grabbed the completed work back up into subsequent rows making an unholy mess that required scissors and a surgeon's skill to unravel.Do yourself a favor, just invest in decent knitting needles and scrap this awful toy idea."
1,very badly made,"This product is badly made, and not worth any time or energy. Please do yourself a favor and don't bother with buying it.I bought one, it lasted all of about 2 hrs, until it broke."
1,Bunch of Junk,I agree with so many of you regarding this product. It is a bunch of junk. I have gone through 3 of them. The first I was able to get one scarf that was not long enough to wear before the machine broke. I took it back to the store and got another one and I didn't make it through one round and it jammed and I had to cut the yarn out of it. Took the machine apart to try and fix for over 2 hours nothing. Went back and brought a 3rd. I was determined that I was going to get this to work. Broke after 10 mins of use. I gave up and am still searching for a better product. This thing needs to be pulled from the market. After spending this much money I could have brought a scarf.
1,A Tease of a Toy!,"This toy is great at first, once you've overcome the initial adult setup. Crank away, and pretty soon you'll have a nice tube. Don't get excited. Before long, the machine will drop a stitch, jam, or in some other way mess up something that had your kid excited. We've tried it six times, and the longest we've gotten is about 2 feet...a little short for a scarf. Most of the others failed within a few inches. It's a great idea; it just doesn't work."
1,"Don't do it - we returned not one, but TWO!!!","Okay, so as a mom to a 7 year old who crochets, I thought this might be beneath my daughter. Fact is, she loved the machine when it worked, which for TWO of them TOTALLED about an hour. The concept is there, but the plastic must break inside is all I can figure...We returned the first one after about 15 minutes. The second one lasted long enough to make two long tubes, then it, too, jammed the SAME way....I would love to find one that actually lasts beyond an hour, since as I said, the concept is good!"
1,This machine is horrible!,"I purchased this machine to make scarves, as the box stated it would. I did not even get a single row knitted before the thing tore up. It jammed, then it quit moving altogether. It was not due to the button being up, I made sure it was down. This is about the worst piece of crap I have ever purchased in my life."
1,Buyer beware - DEFECTIVE ITEM,"My daughter received this as a gift. After 2 hours of easy use, the crank mechanism that turns the barrel froze up and would not move. It was returned and replaced by an identical item. The 2nd one broke after only a few out of light use. This time the crank itself fell off and cannot be repaired or replaced. Buyer beware of this product. It is not durable and does not live up to the hype of the product packaging."
5,NOT sure why everybody hates it! We have made six projects so far and going strong.,This thing works like a charm! We've made several projects so far- socks and scarfs. My daughters (7 and 9) are able to do most of it after I set it up.
2,Not very practical...............,"Cute idea, but when turning the crank the machine isn't stable and you need an additional person to hold down the machine. Can't imagine any child being able to do this on her own. My daughter felt very frustrated!! Not worth the money!"
3,I had a Knit Magic -,"I rated this as 3 stars all thorough so I could post this. I got a Knit Magic(a much earlier version) as a kid and love it - yes that is right - I still have it and my mom used it to make 3 King blanlets of woven tubes!!! I am 40 something! I was hoping that this was a new version, apparently it is, but not as durable or reliable, too bad - it was a lot of FUN!"
3,Enterprise Architectures,Excellent book for overview of Enterprise Applications Architects. Provides a high level and in depth view of what is involved in designing systems. Recommended for CIOs and Architects.
2,Enterprise System Archtectures,This book has a lot of good historical information and is well written but for $93 a copy I want more current information from a technology book. This thing was written nine years ago. That is about three lifetimes in the IT world. Time for an update.
1,Not the Java I expected....,"If you wanna learn Java don't try this but, basically it's divided in two chapters, the first one has nothing but technical references and the other one has a minnimum of code and it really doesn't explain how to program at all.If you wanna make programs with forms try Visual Basic!"
2,Talks the features but doesnt show you how,"As a start up J++ developer this books lacks what I was looking for or need. This is really a outline of what it will do, ie whether to purchuse J++ or not."
1,Want real Java? Avoid Microsoft products.,"It is to Microsoft's financial advantage to crush Java, because the language's platform independence represents a threat to their monopoly. They are using their usual tactic of ""embrace, extend, and extinguish"" in the case of Visual J++. This is confirmed by Java experts on forums such as news://comp.lang.java.programmer, and by Sun's recent lawsuit against Microsoft for violation of the contract by which Microsoft uses the Java trademark.Besides that, the tool is simply inferior to real Java products such as Borland JBuilder and Symantec Cafe. It is a struggle to use it to do useful work, despite the bleatings of the MS spin machine, which has clearly been at work amongst the suits at amazon.com.Want real Java? Avoid Microsoft and its books. Want Microsoft? Stick to Visual Basic."
5,Native American Flute,"Beautiful! While at the Grand Canyon recently, I listened to part of this cd, purchased it, came home and purchased another from Amazon for a friend. He keeps it in the cd player of the car for soothing music while driving!"
5,did the job,They were easy to set and had no problems catching the field mice. Will definitely reorder this product if necessary.
3,gear wrench flex head wrenches from amazon,i am an auto mechanic for over 45 years. the tools appear usable.But there is no way to diassemble and clean and oil the ratchet. will see what happens.again ordering through amazon was about 25% less than other sights.
3,"Good enough, for the price","I've used many of the Gearwrench and Craftsman. Both have the exact same degree of movement required to move a bolt. I prefer the flexing Craftsman because the heads stay tight, and have a setting to lock in place. Over time, many of the Gearwrench heads loosen, requiring frequent tightening of the tiny allen bolt, and without the locking mechanism it's a two-handed job to wield one of these in most cases. Craftsman also have a significantly longer handle, allowing more leverage.Gearwrench is a little cheaper because they are made in Taiwan. The flexhead Craftsman are made in the US. So if you feel like saving a few bucks for a comparable but lesser product, while contributing to the bankruptcy of your country and putting Americans out of work, buy this set right up."
5,GREAT TOOLS,"The Gear Wrench Flexible Ratcheting Wrenches have became my primary wrenches of choise. They are strong,ratchet very easily and for hard to get to or tight areas they are priceless."
1,It sucks....litterally,"I purchased this mirror to replace one I had for 8 years. It came with 3 suction cups on the back. I attached it to my bathroom mirror ready to check it out. When I had finished, I tried to get the suction cups to release, and the whole glass mirror crashed to the tile floor. The frame was still stuck, and the suction cups were too, but the mirror was in pieces on the floor. If you buy this product, don't use all the suction cups. One will do. I would send it back but it would cost almost as much in postage as I paid for it."
1,A waste of money,"The diameter is actually 7 inches with a 2 inch border to make it the advertised 9 nine inches. The mirror fogs up as soon as steam develops in the shower. It took too long to arrive, and it turned out to be worthless. I am disgusted with my purchase."
1,Mirror???,This is the worst waste of money I have ever had. the only good thing about this mirror is the suction cups. 3x magnification??? more like 9x !!! you have to have your face right on the mirror or it looks like you are standing by one of those funny distorted amusment park mirrors.My suggestion would be not to waste your money on it. its a joke.
2,"Works okay, if you're not looking for ""fogless""","So, yeah, it mounts in your bathroom with the suction cups, and once it's mounted, it stays put pretty well. Unfortunately, it has so far never actually been ""fogless."" Get a good shower going, and the mirror fogs up in record time. Splash some water on it, and you can see yourself for half a minute, but overall, this is a disappointment."
2,Mirror,Mirror does not meet expectations - will be returning it. Not the products fault - it's my mother's eyes!!! We'll try again.
3,Pretty good mirror...,"The mirror met my expectations. I give it a passing review, but be careful to clean the surface and wet the suction cups when hanging it. It sticks to tile or another mirror very well if you do that. If not... ...it will take an unwelcome fall."
3,Travelogue full of desultory ideas,"The main themes of this book are Asian economic crisis(1997-) and prospect for Asian countries' future. Though it is very helpful to understanding Asian economic crisis, the prospect for Asia's future borders on a fairy tale, which I don't believe.And I found a few factual errors. In page 137, South Korea is describe as importing more than exporting. But in reality, South Korea is exporting more than she is importing. In page 155-156, Sheryl WuDunn said Russian(Ukraine) serfs had been freed by law in 1848. If my memory is correct, Russian emancipation was in 1842(voluntary) and 1861(mandatory). According to page 246, South Korean president Kim Dae Jung visited Japan in 1998 and announced that he was ending the ban on imports from Japan. This gives false impression that all Japanese products had been banned until 1998. The ban was only about Japanese cultural products like movies. I, as South Korean man, am now able to see Japanese movies since the ban was lifted."
5,Great CD,I purchased this based on my previous experience with some other assorted Miles Davis CD's. I'm on the third disc and honestly I have it on repeat and it is not tiring or fatiguing - both my wife and I (we are in our 20's) love it! There is so much music in this set that its a new experience everytime. If you like Miles Davis you will love this disc set!
2,TRAGIC: Smashing music-- terrible transfer,"The music is fantastic, but the range of sound transferred onto the discs is quite poor. Very bright, very little bass there at all. The master tapes are probably so worn down by now that they couldn't transfer much of the original information. This is one of the clearest, most easily noticeable examples of compact discs sounding so much worse than the original vinyl releases. I know many Amazon customers don't use vinyl albums anymore and I know that die-hard Miles Davis fans will have to have this box set anyway for the previously unreleased material. Just brace yourself to be disappointed."
1,Disappointed,"My kids had one of these that worked for a very long time. When it failed, the pictures on the screen quit showing. I ordered a replacement and it had the same problem. Half of the pictures on the LCD don't work. The game is unplayable."
4,"Fun, convienant game!","I bought this from Amazon and my child loves it! I didn't think he would because he is used to more advanced games, but this is fun for him for a change of pace. I especially like to take this if we go to the doctor's office or any other boring place because it keeps him busy."
4,Worth its price :),"Here are several stories that tell how loving and trusting women can benefit the people they love, either poking their noses into other's lives or standing by their side when they do silly things. ""Silver pitchers"" is just the first of the stories. I found it a little boring, more moral tales than ""Little women"", although very customary in Louisa May Alcott's time, in my opinion. Tecnically, it has a good layout and editing. Worth its price :)"
4,great album,Great CD! Another well-worth-it addition to our Toad the Wet Sprocket collection. Not as good as some of the others but still a CD worth having.
4,Great Sounds from the mid-nineties,"I picked this up in high school and always liked it but moved it along in one of my cd-selloffs back in the day thinking I had had enough of it. Funny how time changes your perceptions. So for some reason I felt compelled to get it back and found it here from one of the amazon sellers. A perfect cd delivered to your door for $4, gotta love the internet. After first listen, it' better than I remembered. I actually like this more than the more popular Dulcinea. There isn't really a killer song here, just a lot of highly melodic compositions, it's easy listening without any of the negative connotations associated with that phrase.My favorites are All in All, Hobbit on the Rocks, Brother, & All She Said"
3,Fear is better than Syrup,"I really love Toad, but I didn't really care for this album. The words to the songs are wonderful, but they could of spent more time developing the music. Buy Fear to get a more sophisticated Toad sound."
5,a great gift,"I recently purchased this CD for my father, and he's been listening to it nonstop. He loved the Sir Douglas Quintet back in the 70's, and since several of the members make up this band, only with a Tex-Mex twist, he loves this group as well."
5,A Texas Musical Legend!,"What can you say about Doug Sahm and the Sir Douglas Quintet that hasn't been said? Nothing!This anthology of songs says it all and says it well! I enjoyed this album very much and if you want to hear what The Sir Douglas Quintet sounds like and get a feel for why I titled this review A Texas Musical Legend, BUY THIS CD!"
3,I dig Vernon Reid,"I really dig Vernon Reid, his touch and style on his instrument is very tasteful. This is a good release... but the DJ scratching is REALLY getting tired. Ain't there nothing new happening out there! This is like drinking yesterdays wine, I'm ready for something fresh not phat. But Vernon, you're pure gold and I have the faith that innovation comes from artists like you. By the way, really dug your performance with Fogerty and Billy Bob Klintoon..."
4,A broad and rythmetic collection of guitar riffed tunes,I loved it. With the type of range he has you never get tired of this album.
2,I was HUGELY Disappointed,"I bought this on the strength of the previously written reviews, which I felt were misleading at best. One guy called this ""instrumental (save for one or two raps, and some funny interludes)"" which is a grave disservice to those of us who like instrumental music. There are vocals, talking, raps, conversations, and those bad hip hop, sampled 'drop in voices' on 10 or 11 of the 16 tracks - if you like instrumetal guitar, pass for that reason alone. Add to that the totally overused, unoriginal bad scratching sound ruining several cuts including the, ""flat out power soloing of ""Mistaken Identity"" "" - which incidentally is quite a laid back cut overall, with slow , drawn out soloing, not power soloing.The comment made about, ""There's moments of pure shred joy here"" might be literally true, but they are so few and far between you'll fast forward all over the place looking for them. Try again Vernon, maybe with a real drummer this time."
1,GEAR WRENCH SET,i AM STILL AWAITIG DELIVERY AND IT HAS BEEN ONE MONTH WHEREIS IT. IT HAS BEEN PICKED UP BY UPS BUT I DON'T HAVE IT. HOW CAN I RATE IT. PLEASE ADVISE.
4,4-1/2 stars -- Great collection except for one thing,"This collection, Tha Down Low, is a nice collection of smooth R&B jams. There are plenty of songs on here to get the mood right, like Faith Evans' ""Soon As I Get Home"", R. Kelly's ""Your Body's Callin'"", and Boyz II Men's ""I'll Make Love to You"". There are also some other smooth ballads like Aailyah's rendition of ""At Your Best"", K-Ci & JoJo's ""All My Life"", and SWV's ""Weak"".So what's the problem? This album is supposed to be music to basically get the mood right, right? So WHAT THE HELL IS ""THA CROSSROADS"" DOING ON HERE??? Sure, it's a great song (probably the most overplayed song Bone has done, too), but can you really picture yourself gettin' it on to THAT? ""I don't wanna die."" / ""Faster! Faster!"" Yeah, I didn't think so. But other than that, this is a great collection.Anthony Rupert"
2,Nothing to write home about,"Gripsoft Slicker Brush - SmallI have no idea how you would like this for a cat or a shorter coated dog. But it didn't do well as a detangler on my Havanese, Shih Tzu, or Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier."
4,interesting,"it's worth to keep a copy of this single not only because of the really funny video included but all the tracks are creative & cool,espc.the title track combining a female vocal."
4,sweeping electronic music,"this import is well worth the purchase, if just for the uncut cdrom video of 'metal fingers in my body'; but fortunately for us, this cd includes epic an memorable tracks like the title track, 'revenge of the black reagent', with lush vocals, or the imperialistic 'march of the pure mathematical evil which reults and ends in war'. overall, a solid album, although i personally did not like 'is that alright FYUZ'. also recommended: aphex twin, underworld."
2,"HEAVY , DARK , GLOOMY AND DOOMY","I have heard of these guys before but never heard their music . I was looking for a band that played Black Sabbath (my all time favorite band) type of heavy metal and a few people recommended Candlemass . I was told that this was their finest cd , so I figured I would try it. It wasn't exactly was I was looking for , but it is a very good metal cd. It's the 2006 remastered version with a bonus live disc. It's very heavy and dark . This probably isn't much help , but I don't know what it is that I cant get into with this cd . I do like the live stuff better than the studio stuff though."
4,Advice for Good Health,"Dr Roizen is one of today's foremost ""Good Health Advisers"".This presentation is very good. I learned a lot of importantbasic anti-aging tips that I can use."
5,Great DVD,"Dr. Roizen is an impressive teacher. He discusses risk factors and teaches how to lower risk factors for multiple diseases, not only through lifestyle, diet, and exercise (which we've all heard before), but also by detailing the importance of some extremely vital supplements."
2,Very interesting,"In this book, Dr. Roizen presents a pretty easy to follow approach for being in control of your body and for understanding your responsibilities for its care."
3,"Excellent music, poor quality","This CD has an excellent selection of Colosseum tracks, but many seem to be poor quality mono recordings. Tracks from the original and brilliant Valentyne Suite album are especially disappointing in this regard. Surely recent CDs should be aiming at the best quality possible; otherwise, what's the point? Be warned!"
3,Why use mono versions ?,"The music is excellent, but for some reason they've used mono versions of songs from Valentyne Suite and Daughter of Time (the remainder are stereo). If you buy this to see if you like the band, as I did, you will probably end up wanting to buy the original cds mentioned above as well."
2,"So good music, so bad sound quality!","Be aware, it's not only that two thirds of this compilation are in mono (songs from Valentyne Suite and Daughter of Time)! While comparing it with stereo CD of Valentyne Suite I learned there are moments where I am missing an instrument (specially guitar solos), or I can here it, but very quietly in the background. And it is so-called ""Original Recording Remastered"", which after listening really sounds ridiculous.By the way songs are not in their chronological order."
2,Hello Hello,"The cd has lost some luster since I bought the vinal in the 60's. Title track is still great, but the rest is pretty dated."
5,The Tragedy of not Knowing,"A very good book,which every christian should read.Its enlightening and will make you think where your prioritys should be."
2,For Fans Only,"This album is great only if you have heard the songs before and are interested in hearing them a little different, or, if you are partial to mixed up albums. However, newcomers to KMFDM should NOT PICK UP this disc. The quality of the live recording does no do the group justice. KMFDM are rumored to have a killer live show, but it seems like you have to be there in person to be impressed."
4,My favorite of the two KMFDM live albums,"I think that this one is better, because I believe that ATTAK is a better album overall than WWIII. It is easier for me to listen to this album than the WWIII live album."
5,Should have kept these,"I had this entire series when my children were growing up, then in a fit of decluttering I got rid of them. Now my children are adults and wondering why I did that. My adult daughter is looking for them online. It is an excellent series. They are fun to read and genuinely help children think about right and wrong. They also help parents talk to their children about right and wrong. I know they had an impact on my children and I highly recommend them, especially at the low prices they appear to be going for these days."
3,"Five stars for appearance, two for songs","This is a beautiful book with great illustrations, and well-bound hardcover. But it is not a serious songbook in that it contains only snippets of some songs' tablature, and not all the lyrics of others. I don't think it's meant as a ""songbook"" really, and it shouldn't have been called that. It's more like a reminder of all those wonderful songs out there in American culture. The illustrations are beautiful and, rather than having a spot at our piano, it will have a place on our coffee table as a reminder of why we like classic American songs."
5,Good quality cable,"I've tried other cables--ok, I was cheap and bought whatever was available at the store. The signal looked terrible, so I didn't use it and kept the tv where it was. Several years later, decided I really need to move the tv to another location, so ordered this based on good reviews. I am really happy with it. The picture looks perfect!"
1,poorly disign muffler,"i have small 3 hp yamaha generator, when i installed i did not noticed any differece. i do not recommend it."
2,"Informative book, but beware of Echo version","On browsing this book, it appears very informative for those interested in Victorian households and how the prominent Beechers advised women to manage their homes. However, I purchased the version of the book published by Echo Library, unaware that this version does NOT include the illustrations that appeared in the original book. The Beecher authors refer to at least 77 figures in their writing, but since none are included in Echo's version, it was difficult for me to follow the text or completely understand what it was saying. I feel quite cheated and am thus returning the book. But I think a version that includes the illustrations would be a great reference book for Victorian historians!"
2,Not as good as previous editions...,"I am pretty sure earlier versions of this book featured images. This one does not... Other than having no images, it is the same as earlier versions."
1,Sunshine with Mostly Cloudy Sound,"I don't know what they are calling remastered, it sounds just awful. When the first Archies album was remastered with original artwork, it was absolutely pristine in sound. It's shameful to lead people into thinking it sounds good with what they called remastered. Don't bother."
1,Remaster my a..,"When I got the CD I was very excited. It was the original cover but with Digital Remastered written on it.The cover printed on cheap paper with no information at all, but the title fo the tracks. No bandmembers and no writers.Remastered ??? If it is remastered, you can call everything you copy from tape or LP for remastered.It sounds bad with distortion, cliks and pops.This is a great dissapointment and should be remomed from Amazon."
5,Fireman,I have 3 boys on the Fire Department and I love these as a gift for their dogs. I gave them all cutters along with a recipe for dog cookies. Fun to make and Madi loves em. Perfect cookie size.
5,Feel the Power,"My friend who had athlete's foot (see Lamisol review) discovered this ""men's"" soap and gave me one to try out. As we generally don't talk about much other than men's health products (he gets a kick out of this), I reluctantly agreed.To my surprise I had to agree that this stuff is great. It works well and has a nice scent without being overpowering. Suds emanate freely and the loofah-like covering is not just a clever sales gimmick--it seems to have some exfoliation properties and gives your skin a nice (albeit, temporary) glow. The plastic loofah covering can tear; however, use a little restraint. Great for apres-sport when you need a powerful deodorant soap without a chemical feeling. Hopefully, my friend will develop a new hobby."
5,Now Discontinued,This was one of my favorite products. Simple yet effective for getting the morning off to a good start. No Girly scent or application needed.I was lucky enough to buy 20 bars just as it went out of stock and is now sadly discontinued forever. If only the people who make this stuff would'nt be so short sighted. Ive read nothing but great things about this product. Yet they get rid of it. Wonder how many thousands of guys they have frustrated with this move...
5,Very refreshing.,I use it for everyday shower. It lathers up quickly. Doesn't have too strong scent like other soaps. Easy to hold in your palm and rub on your body smoothly.
1,Warning...,This book has been around for quite some time. The only problem is that you cant Learn how to safely perform these procedures from a simple booklet!
4,Exactly what I expected,Got exactly what I expected. Came in nice packaging. This brand name is very well known so I didn't expect it to be anything more or less. Good deal here.
2,"Good fit, but ""grip"" doesn't last","I bought these gloves with high expectations, but I was let down. I own a few different pair of Mechanix gloves for different applications and thought these gloves would be a good addition. The gloves fit very well, but the grippy dots don't last. After the first night of use the thumbs on both gloves were bald, and it has gotten progressively worse. I would not buy these again."
2,Gloves failed after 1 week,"I've always loved this brand of gloves....this pair was disappointing. My last pair lasted 3 years before the seams being to fail.Went on a camping trip with them by the end of the week, one finger tip seam had failed.The little texture beads are a gimmick, most had fallen or torn off within the first 2 days.Disappointed, going to return for credit and try a different model."
5,Vehicle Voltron rules!,"As a kid growing up, I always thought Vehicle Voltron was cooler and more fascinating than Lion Voltron. I'm trilled the VV epsiodes are finally coming to DVD. I also love the continuity between the two shows, e.g., Chip is Pidge's brother. This is great, and in my opinion, the finest Voltron. (Now, if we could only get them to produce Gladiator Voltron as originally planned.)GO VOLTRON FORCE!!!"
5,"Thank You Anime Works :) Thank You, Thank You, Thank You","HECK YA BABY :)It's a dream come true. I am so glad they decided to redo Vehicle Voltron Also. Since it will be redone by Anime Works, I know it's going to be only the best possible quality :) Thank you so very, very much Anime Works :)"
5,out yet?,is this release date correct? everyother place ive tried ordering from says its been delayed till the end of december. even a search on google comes up with reports of a delay from media works. can anyone confirm that they have this?
3,Cardboard an indicator of what's to come?,"Who's idea was it to cheapen an 8o's classic with a cardboard container, instead of metal one. And I noticed the discs from the second disc of set 5 the black lion on.... vibrate badly, though the episodes are viewable their quality is that of vhs. The sad thing is I could live without that crap, World Events solo project sucks. Media Blasters should have forgotten all those episodes and skipped straight to vehicle voltron. The characters suck, the voice acting sucked, the music sucked. They made Voltron but couldn't keep Voltron true to form? It makes little sense to me,but set 5 should have been in a cardboard container with a few sheets of toilet paper as a warning to what was to come."
5,This book Kicks!,"I absoulutally loved this book! Only being exposed to the DIC version of sailormoon, the first two subtitled movies, and the information I collected from the www, I was thrilled to finally figure out the original storyline for myself and not depend on the reviews of other people. What I really liked about this is the fact that Usagi is more... grown up. She has a strong and confidant air whilst fighting and the classic phrase ""your pain is my pain' is a real winner. Mamoru is more like the caring romantic he's supposed to be, rather the the thick-headed dolt that DIC has made him. If you love BSSM you will LOVE this book!"
5,A great book!,If you like Sailor Moon ead this book it told me things about Sailor Moon I had never heard before and was really fun to read. The pictures are great and is a real page turner!
4,Review,The item I purchased is great but it showed up on the last day for shipping. It took over a month to get to the U.S.
4,Sailormoon Super S,"This book is pretty good. I'm also appreciative the fact that the Outers,Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Pluto, go my their Japanese names, Kaoiu Michiru, Ten'ou Haruka, Tomoe Hotaru, and Meiou Setsuna. It's also better reading about Chibi Moon instead of the frightening Mini Moon (?, shudder). Chibi-Usa wa kawaii desu yo! Haruka-senpai will always be Haruka."
3,Average SM volume,"Sailor Moon Super S vol. 3 is an average chapter in the continuing saga of Bunny, Darien, and her sailor scout friends. Naoko Takeuchi's artwork is not as crisp as the previous volume. During the battle scenes it is confusing and difficult to figure out what is happening. The sound effects are odd and distracting: ""float"" (is that a sound?), ""russle"" (does she mean rustle?), ""stickyyy,"" ""bro broom,"" and one of the most puzzling, ""hurrrl."" These negative comments reflect the second half of the book; the first half is rewarding.In the first half, the mystery of the Golden Crystal and Bunny and Darien's relationship in their previous lives is revealed. The first half also gives a never-before-seen, in-depth look at the outer senshi's private lives. (...)"
3,"after seeing this concert many times, i feel it is good.","the many different artists give this concert a new take some old songs. waters wrote most of the songs and surely choses whom performs which selection, as well it should be. i have been a long time fan of Pink Floyd, but enjoyed this concert, even though only one original member of the group was present."
1,A Classic Case of Character Killing,"I have been there, when this monster was performed. It was great fun to be there, in spite of the sound dropping away twice, being absolutely unable to 'relieve' one's bladder and hearing Cyndi Lauper (stoned and drunk) making a mess of Another Brick Part Two.A concert performance of this magnitude deserves everybody's respect, but Waters should have had the respect of not putting it out on disc. It is truly the worst 'concert' registration I have ever heard, and I am quite sure that 90% of it has been reworked in the studio.Most sorely missed is the guitar of one David Gilmour. The (two) guitar players that try to do his trick fall short a long way.Wait for the Pink Floyd live-release of The Wall, somewhere in 2000"
2,The Wall The Way You Didn't Want To Hear It,"Well, I give this release two stars because a huge effort was put into the production back in 1990. And I am sure it would have been a blast to attend. However, The Wall Live In Berlin as a CD is unlistenable. The only track that isn't awful is the full orchestra on the instrumental section of ""Is There Anybody Out There?"" Several songs are ruined here, including Van Morrison singing Dave Gilmours parts on ""Comfortable Numb"", Cyndi Lauper singing ""Another Brick In The Wall Pt II"", and most horribly, the Scorpions performing ""In The Flesh"". If Waters had used his Bleeding Hearts Band, this might have been a better listen. If you want a live version of The Wall, you might do better with ""Is There Anybody Out There"", the Floyd' release of The Wall recorded back in the early eighties. The best bet however is to stick with the studio release."
4,As I remember it.....,"I was there at the concert so I have a slightly different take on the CD than most. It wasn't about the music or who sung what song. It was more about the plight of a city and a nation. Roger Waters and the rest of the musicians put on a great show considering where it was at. Potsdam platz was nothing more than a mine field a few month earlier. With temperatures soaring in the 90F it was nothing more than a dust bowl. Yet they were able to pull off a great concert that was being taped live for the video. If your into European history, I reccommend the video from this truly historic concert not to mention it's not a bad listen."
3,"GOOD BUT NOT ""ROGER""QUALITY","i do have this on VHS,i can honestly that this is not ROGERS best work.don't get me wrong roger is good,but,I was disapointed that the other groups that participated,i wish roger would have done this on his own.maybe,to show that he really didn't need the other guys(dave,richard,nick).But this IS my opinion."
1,WORST LIVE ALBUM EVER MADE,"This album doesn't even deserve one star. Every song sounds terrible. Roger's voice is not there and the other artists just don'f fit the songs that they sing(Cyndi Lauper, Another Brick... II??). Don't bother with this set, if you really want live Wall concerts, they are out there, with all four members, and they sound good."
1,Tear down The Wall!!! PLEASE!!!,This version of The Wall shows without a doubt that the reason the orignal album is so good is because of the band that played ie Pink Floyd.This version is full of so called stars which butcher and hack their way through each song and you sit there waiting for the wall to be torn down so you can eject the CD and never listen to it again.Van Morrison sounds like he is drunk when he sings Comfortably Numb slurring his speech.Also I though Roger Waters was totally against stadium concerts which was his original influence for creating the wall even though the proceeds of the concert went to charity.
2,not too great,"i could go on forever about how much this album isn't as good as the studio version, but i will just say thata : if you want it live, is there anybody out there?b : the happiest days of our lives doesn't flow very much, unlike the album and (earls court) live version.c: van halen doesn't sound like gilmour, and shouldn't try to.thank you very much."
2,"Not the wall, definetely","This album just proves what I've known for awhile, Pink Floyd can be great without Waters, but waters can't be great without Pink Floyd. Do yourself a favor and get the original, you won't be sorry."
1,"""Feels me with the urge to defecate"".","The Wall was a great album, when it was performed by Pink Floyd. The album would even have been good if Roger Waters had done it alone with regular stage musicians, but instead he had to ruin his masterpiece by having no talented performers like Cyndi Lauper. Waters may have written most of this album, but it was written for Pink Floyd to perform. Nobody, even if you have talent, should be allowed to redo a Pink Floyd song. David Gilmour, Richard Wright, and Nick Mason should consider this album an insult to themselves and to the Pink Floyd name. If you're thinking about buying this album, don't do it, save your money and buy the original instead. One question, if Waters is so against stadium rock (like he said the album is about), then why was it performed."
3,What I received is not what I ordered.,"I ordered the Pilot Automotive LP-151B Chrome Nissan 3D License Plate which is what I ordered but what I received is not how it looks on the Amazon website. The plate on line has the circle blackened out. The plate I received shows all chrome except for the word ""Nissan."" I am keeping the plate because I really wanted it but feel like me and the other customers deserve some type of apology for the fraudulent advertising of the said product."
5,"Perfect for home, school, or educational use","We got this book for visual aids teaching environmental community classes. But the prints are so beautiful (a post-Renaissance, almost Flemish, reminiscent of Jan Van Eyck). So we ended up framing a few of them and using them at home - in the kitchen and the solarium. The previous reviewer is correct - there are some better prints out there. But these are great, and, the book also includes a small encyclopedia entry on every plant, plus a brief explanation of the print."
2,SO AND SO..,"Not a great musical, indeed. It might be interesting to collectors of old musicals but not interesting for the common people. The songs are quite conventional, forgetable and uninspired. I simply did not care much about it."
3,It's okay for a remake......,"I have to admit this wasn't too bad for a remake. Jude Law was pretty good as Alfie. I just found the storyline a little bit slow. Susan Sardon wasn't too bad in this film either. Anyway, check this film out, You might like it."
3,about the movie Alfie.......,I bought this DVD from Singapore video shops...hee hee and could say is that this alfie is going around town looking for different woman (he is a married man) which later end up he not only lost his wife whom had a new boyfriend but also did not get any women that he had relation with afterall. Recommended for those whom like this category of movie/films.....Review by:Ang Poon KahPhD (Prof) in political science from Cambridge University and NUS.PhD (Prof) in Neuroscience from Cambridge University and NUS.PhD (Prof) in Technology from Cambridge University and NUS.PhD (Prof) in Security System from Cambridge University and NUSPhD (Prof) in Computer from Cambridge University and NUS.PhD (Prof) in film from Cambridge University and NUS.PhD (Prof) in Business from Cambridge University and NUS.PhD (Prof) in Electronics Engineering from Cambridge University and NUS.Bachelor degree in computer studies from Techco UniversityZakkers film director
3,friendly service,"i ordered a # $.01"" dvd, it arrived unplayable. i thought thats it my money is gone, i know its not much but the fact i m paying for nothing. but the seller was really nice abt it, the resending me the new copy even though it takes forever to get to me ( 1 1/2 month ) but i really like that they acknowledge my order"
4,AWESOMELY ENTERTAINING !,"This movie is a lot better than what they gave Jude Law credit for. This is a great ""couples"" movie. A bit of a tear-jerker, and what a compatible soundtrack !"
1,What went wrong with this movie?,"The previews look good. The leading man looks VERY good. He wears Prada & Gucci. It takes place in Manhattan. He's even manages to look sexy driving a baby blue Vespa! So, what went wrong? And why did it take 2 hours for me to figure it out while others were walking out of the theater about 5 minutes? I think I kept hoping that it would get better...or at least catch some skin/peek at Jude in his Birthday Suit. :-) Pssst...don't hold your breath.I won't give any details (there aren't many anyway) as to the content of Alfie. He's pondering the meaning of life and ""what's it all about?"".I'm still wondering ""What was I thinking and why didn't I let one my friends spend her $7.95 to see if before me?????"
1,Boring,"It takes a lot of work to make Jude Law boring, and this film pulls it off. He's empty and brainless as Alfie, all words and no edge. The move to New York, though he's dressed in 60s styles, seems ridiculous, especially when he says New York has the most beautiful women in the world. I grew up there, but I've also been to Paris and other European cities and hearing that line made me guffaw and think: There goes reality! I gave up despite the sizzling Nia Long, who stole every scene she was in. Law kept feeling to me like he was pouring on the technique, following the director's vision of the character rather than his own. A real misfire from this actor."
1,Holy COwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!,this was the most boring movie ive eVVVVVVVVer seen!! it was all about sex and there was not a climax throughout the whole movie. my friend took me to see this for her birthday and i had a feeling it was goin to be bad. the best part about the whole movie was cleaning up the drool that came from my mouth when i was sleeping through half the movie!!and im serious im not just saying i fell asleep to get attention but i seriously fell asleep! now take a gander at that. go ahead ......see the movie.......waste your hard earned money......go ahead and bring your hand with you because that was all it was made for(a lil innuendo there)
2,2 * for mick jagger @ the very end,The movie was Awful But mick Jagger at the end singing was probably the best part My advice buy the soundtrack Do'nt waste you money on this Peace of crap of a movie.
3,Average Alfie.,"Jude Law was what kept most of my interest in this movie. He plays the part of Alfie perfectly. I found this movie to be somewhat depressing, which makes this movie slightly difficult to view. I can't compare this to the original Alfie since I've never seen it, but I'm thinking it may be worse than this one."
3,solid acting but....,"Acting by the entire cast was damn good. What kept this from being a keeper in my DVD collection was the script-Character conversations are a bit trite, exhibiting all the back-n-forth verbal luster of a 1950's dime store novel. Law starts out a bit rocky, perhaps owing to the ""talking directly to the camera"" point of view, but this soon becomes more than bearable as the film progresses- It just takes a bit of getting used to. The biggest fault in Alfie's world is his ""what could have been"" paranoia in relationships, always believing there is someone better out there beyond the time he spends with his current (sometimes multiple) love interests. But, at least his character goes through a progression: starting out with a carefree attitude with women, eventually mounting into a man with a bit of depth and understanding , and ultimately realizing the true importance of loving....At least I think that's where the movie was going."
2,surprisingly dissapointing,"i am a fan of jude law and think he's very handsome. i was also excited to watch this movie (and see sienna miller who was emerging as the ""it"" girl when this came out). i saw the previews and on-set pics for Alfie and thought it would be good. unfortunately it was boring. it just had no spark. it was lackluster. and for some reason jude law's speech is a bit incomprehensible (guess it's his accent). the people i watched it with kept saying ""what did he just say?"" that makes the movie difficult to follow b/c Alfie is the one narrating the movie. only when sienna entered it got a bit exciting, but even then it wore off and went back to being dull. i don't know what went wrong with the movie. maybe they need to try it again in a few years."
3,Not as devastating as the 60's classic?,"The movie has a moral, but gets at it by exposing usto the life style of the young and shameless?I ask where the pathos is here?The idea was to discourage sexual partnerindiscrimination in the young,but Alfie is certainly not devastated enough by half in the end for all the bed hopping in betweenand betraying his best friend.The young people will still want to be an ""Alfie"".But I'm sure it made money this second time too."
1,ho hum,This movie is too boring. It is painful to sit through the hold thing.I would never watch this movie again.Unless I was really bored with nothing else to do.Jud Law isn't very good in it even when he talks into the camera.
4,WORTH WATCHING,"a charming limo driver learns the hard way that there are consequences that come with excessive womanizing!DVD has deleted scenes, 5 featurettes, 2 audio commentaries and script, production, and story board galleries.rated R for language, sexual content, and some drug use.great movie for jude law fans-mediocre for casual viewers."
2,SKIP THIS REMAKE. SEE THE ORIGINAL,"In 1966, Michael Caine as Alfie was asked: What's it all about? Charles Shyer's ALFIE (Paramount) begs another question: Why was the classic 60's film about the fundamental emptiness of the sexual revolutin remade? No longer set in swinging London, the new version still features a glib Brit who talks to the camera. He's still on the make, but here transported to contemporary New York.Not particularly witty, clever or insightful, this great-looking film has nothing new to say but says it anyway. The ubiquitous Jude Law is fine in the Michael Caine part and Marisa Tomei, Nia Long, Sienna Miller and Susan Sarandon are convincing as the manipulated and manipulative women in his life.I noticed writer director Shyer's name is printed at least ten times on the DVD box. That must be some kind of record. Maybe that's why this movie was remade."
3,Alfie,"This movie was incredibly depressing, about a man who is basically a player, screwing everything in sight until one day tables are turned on him in a really cool way. I didn't feel sorry for him at all, but Jude Law portrayed him perfectly. Loved the line the old guy gave him, ""next time think before you unzip."""
3,Not too impressive,We started to watch the 1966 movie with Michael Cane but decided to watch this one with Jude Law. Not worth it.
2,To Follow Michael Acuna's Review Is One Big Challenge!,"Although I totally disagree with his descriptive adjectives over earlier, Michael Caine...that Jude Law's version of Alfie is all three: ""watered-down, scrubbed and sanitized"" gigolo/playboy in relating to healthy Lassies, Sienna, Marisa & Susan, it appears to me that each one used him in widely divergent ways!I cannot agree with any reviewer that Jude Law remotely fulfills his ""sanitized, scrubbed, watered-down"" idea of this obsessive, compulsive character; Even with an over-healthy, wealthy, Susan Sarandon! In fact, his escapades left me unimpressed, under-sea, at-odds with Director Shyer's Movie! Enough...an older retired, Chaplain Fred W Hood"
3,"Jude Law carries his own in a saucy, suave performance....","Jude Law (Closer, Cold Mountain) plays Alfie, a saucy, suave womanizer who goes around pleasing himself by sleeping with women who are not getting any from their husbands or boyfriends or just random women and so forth and he doesnt want to commit to any of them but then reality smacks him back in the face. Jude Law is fun to watch and he really gets into the role and the women are well cast in each role...Marisa Tomei (My Cousin Vinny, Only You), Sienna Miller (Layer Cake), Susan Sarandon (Elizabethtown, Bull Durham), Jane Krakowski (Ally McBeal,GO) and Nia Long (Baadaaaaas!). It doesnt have what the original 1966 Michael Caine movie he had but Law sure carries his own in this one. Also starring Omar Epps (Dracula 2000, Love & Basketball) and it was a real treat to see Gedde Watanabe (Sixteen Candles) in here....I love that guy. An alright decent remake."
5,Law exudes charisma in Alfie remake,"If you are a Jude Law fan, then you will enjoy Alfie. I have not seen the original, but I can say that this remake makes me want to see the difference between these two movies.Charles Shyer, one of the best director's of remakes, such as the Father of the Bride movies and Parent Trap, helps to make Law radiate charisma when he is on the screen.Alfie is a ladies' man who lives in Manhattan where all the women are gorgeous and he wants to meet every beautiful one of them. I like how is character evolves from being a complete, commitment phobe jerk to a more enlighten individual realizing he might want more than just a one-night stand.All of the performances are really good with knockout performances by all of his leading ladies(Marisa Tomei, Jane Krakowski, Nia Long, Sienna Miller, and most definitely Susan Sarandon).If you want to see a good movie and you are a Jude Law fan, then Alfie is the ticket for you."
5,Great CD for more than just teens...,I just purchased this CD a couple of days ago and we really like it. Especially my 6 year old. He really likes the first track on it. It's upbeat tempo is great. I would definately recommend this to others!
3,"Okay, but no real information","The book is adequate if you want a brief, step by step, follow the picture book. If you want any real information the I sugest that you find a copy of ""turning pens and pencils"" by Christensen and Burningham. It covers the topic in much greater detail, with a much larger gallery.As for the details of this book. There is four pages of text, followed by a short and basic lathe section (how to use tools and the lathe) and then a 40 page section on turning the various items. This sounds impressive, but each page contains 2-4 photos with very little explination. With this book, you will be able to turn a pen quite adequately, but you will only have ""enough to get by with.""Basically, it is a nice addition to your library and a good primer, but if you can have only one book, go with something else."
1,boring,"i've read a lot of shoujo manga...at first when i read the first volume i was a bit put off by the plot...but read it anyways due to art. Those of you who know what really good shoujo manga is knows what i'm talking about. The frame transitions are bad.. the different expressions look the same, too many cliches, the actions of the art don't flow properly. Generally it's just plain boring. However those in the preteen ages might like it--but if you prefer something more interesting and unique, find something else."
3,"Good, but not Bob Marley's best.","Although Bob Marley is one of my favorite artists, I was somewhat dissapointed after listeing to this album. Some of the tracks seem very repetitive and do not demonstrate Marley's true, spiritual talent. Some of the tracks are very good such as ""Pimper's Paradise"" and ""Forever Loving Jah"", but in my opinion, this is not an album that can be listened to from beginning to end."
2,Not exactly what I expected,I was expecting a book with color photos of the paintings; unfortunately the photos were black and white. I skimmed over some of the pages and thought the text to be boring. The book was second-hand (very good condition) and was not an expensive book ($3.00 and change).
2,Cheap immitations? You bet.,"First off this isn't a compilation of tribute tracks from different artists. This is from some made up band called the Chemical Brothers Tribute Group. ALL of the tracks are just their versions of each of these songs. The instrumentation is different since they use different musical gear. The vocalization is different (again... they are doing it themselves). Other than that these are carbon copies. NOT remixes like they pretend to be. The music itself isn't bad, but it is rather bland compared to the dynamic sound you get from the original Brothers.My opinion? You're better off not getting this unless you find it in a bargain bin. The imitations (NOT remixes) are just not good enough."
3,Pointless Alterations,"Denmark is the only track that gave The Chemical Brothers feel, which is what I want."
5,one of the nicest cd's,"i heard this album for the first time from a friend and since that moment i fell in love with this cd. Ive listened to it countless times in all places and everyone who hears it loves it. All the songs on it are awesome, but my personal favorite is Hoops. This song is just amazingly incredible!!!! Just for that song, it is worth buying it. This CD got me into the whole trance and electronic music scene. it is a must have!!!!!!!!!"
4,This Cd dos not have all the songs that are in the movie!!!!!!!!!!,MELISSA ETHERIDGE________Dance Without Sleeping should be on the cd and its not if you look at the ending line up on the dvd or vhs you will see it listed!!!
3,112 is the highlight of this one...,"This album wasn't the best...the only highlight was 112's cut, ""Making Love."" It's a shame they didn't put it on their other cd's. It's a really good song and everybody really stands out vocally. Check it out if you can."
3,one good song( money train),I thought the tracks would be better. Not all of the artest that sanged in the movie are on th cd.
4,R'n'R Kings,"The Devil Dogs split back in 94... the best punk'n'roll band EVER left the planet with their amazing ""Saturday Night Fever"". Now ex-Devil Dog ""Fabulous"" Andy G is back with a new band, featuring, among other, Pete Linzell (ex Raunch Hands) on sax and Candy delMar (ex-Cramps) on bass. The sound is similar to Andy G's former side project Los Primos, but fuller thanks to a second sax player. Only 5 songs! 13 minutes are not a lot for somebody who has been waiting for a new Andy G record for 6 years. But still better than nothing. Power-Punk'n'Roll with some funky sax, where you can feel the Devoil Dogs, the Raunch Hands and Los Primos. Sometimes they could go a bit faster, but for people who dug ""Saturday Night Fever"" more than the first Devil Dogs LP, it will be just fine. In sum: more of that, Andy! Waiting for the LP."
1,Come On waste of time...,"With three full CD's you would think there would be some songs you remember. Well there were....about one or two per CD. The rest was garbage, one hit wonders that would make a great trivia question.This collection is a waste of time and money."
2,VERY UNEVEN FILM,"THOUGH I AM GLAD TO HAVE WATCHED THIS FILM, FOR IT INTRODUCED ME TO A GAY POET I HAD NOT DISCOVERED, THE FILM ITSELF LEAVES QUITE A BIT TO BE DESIRED.FOR A POET WHOSE LIFE WAS DEEMED SCANDALOUS, THE PORTRAIT IS FAR TOO TAME. WHAT ONE GETS IS A HIGH CLASS SISSIFIED DANDY WHO APPARENTLY NEVER WORKED A DAY IN HIS LIFE, WAS MAINTAINED BY HIS FAMILY AND WAS FOND OF BORING CONVERSATIONS WITH HIS EQUALLY BORING GAY FRIENDS. HOMOSEXUALITY IS PRESENTED AS A COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION BETWEEN MEN OF THE UPPER CLASSES AND PROLETARIANS--ALL THE MORE STRANGE GIVEN THE FACT THAT NAPOLEON WAS AN AVOWED COMMUNIST. THE SLOW PACING CAN MAKE IT SEEM QUITE AS LONG AS IT IS.HOWEVER, IT MUST BE WATCHED, IF ONLY ONCE."
1,this is awful,I mean arrrrgggg this is so completley insane why people would want to pay good money to here this.
5,This is cool !,"Lolly is the sweetest little girl I've ever seen. What else can a 15 ys old girl wish for herself? Music , party and boys. Although I am 17, I love this song because it makes me feel all right. This is writtwn for a teen party, isn't it? Lolly is a lovely dolly. A big house fan: Judit from Hungary"
2,Do Any Of These Work?,"Purchased this to run audio from my Panasonic DMP-BDT220 blu-ray player to my Pioneer VSX-91TXH stereo. Does not fit into my Panasonic jack or the Pioneer jack. Also tried with my Samsung 65"" LCD, does not fit into that jack either. I thought that since it was made by Panasonic it would work, I was wrong."
5,Fits 1/2 great!,Bought this for my son's 1/2 violin. It fits snugly (a problem with other shoulder rests) and is very adjustable.
1,"Great Card, but has Power Management Issues","All the functions you'd expect from an ATI chipset, but the card really can't get out of STANDBY power mode. So... if you like using power management features, this is not for you.I was very disappointed that standby no longer worked =/."
2,SanDisk SDCFB-2048-A10 2GB CF Type 1 Card,"Ordered packaged on July 5th and asked for expedited service. Package arrived on July 28th. I really needed it sooner, but I guess it got ""hung up"" in shipping."
5,salad eaters necessity,"this knife is very well priced and works exceptionally well. i use it every afternoon when i make salad. i am one of those people who only likes salads when they're ""chopped fine"" and most knives frequently get food caught within the crevas' of the knife. this knife cut smooth and with ease and no letuce got stuck!!"
3,"Beautiful soundtrack, however...","Morricone's The Mission is a masterpiece.I bought the SACD-version wich has an excellent quality, however it seems not to support multi-channel play. I find it very disapointing.For this you might as well go for the cd-version."
1,pop punk ...,This album is complete and utter trash. I bought this album expectring guttermouth and got blink 182. Blah blah blah I wouldnt even waste my time listening to it if I hadn't already bought it.
4,GutterMouth,this cd is amazing it has a mixture of pop punk and real punk its great its worth the $$$!!!!
2,Gusto - split meaning,"What have the Guys of Guttermouth thought by releasing this album it's in the one hand maybe no ""bad"" music but that isn't the punk music i knew from their former albums like Eat Your Face or Musical Monkey they have almost completly lost their punk image. This albums seems to be only a commercial one which has no real punk music song. I'm disapointed of Guttermouth that would be only one star if i would act realistic."
4,Guttermouths Best Album.,"I really enjoy this album. I pop it in sometime for great songs. Its probably one of there only good albums. Most of there stuff is typical hardcore punk sorta. Most of it sound the same. Especially the album Musical Monkey. I bought it thinking it would be good. And it sucks. I am not kidding when i say every song sounds the same. But this album is great. Its like poppie punk, pop, techno, and its just awesome. Buy it if your a fan of Guttermouth."
1,WOW! This sucks!,"Ok, Guttermouth made a shirt awhile back, that says: ""Punk Rock: A loud, fast, deliberately offensive style of rock music"". I've always agreed with that statement. Punk rock is loud and offensive. The term ""punk"" was used to describe the Sex Pistols. In their time, the Pistols were probably the most offensive thing rock n roll had ever seen. My point is, this album is not punk rock at all. Even Mark Adkins is resentful of this album and he made it. Guttermouth is supposed to be obnoxious anti-pop music, not Blink-182, which is what this sounds like. DO NOT buy this album. Go buy every other guttermouth album though. Do it now."
1,"Have they been touring with Stink, oops I mean Blink 182?","I hope to god that this band will wake up and get back to the good stuff. Don't they know that New Found Glory got booed off the stage at one of the biggest punk festivals (Inland Invasion). I mean common, sure its guttermouth, but my god why are they doing this? I just don't understand."
1,"Nope, sorrry this did not lighten my brown spots.","After pregnancy I developed a few brown spots (not freckle sized, larger) on my upper lip and forehead. This product did not remove or even lighten them. I hope someday to find something that works over the counter."
1,dont buy this it never work ive use it others to and it don't,dont buy this it never work ive use it others to and it don't
1,Never received it!,"I ordered the product, but never received it. I asked the company for either a refund or an EXPEDITED shipment of their product. They chose to give me a refund. Their unwillingness to reship their product made me not want to place another order."
4,Good product,This is a very good product. In shopping around found the price for the quality of this product is very reasonable.
4,"Dark, but very good","Persistence of Time is one of the best Anthrax album point. Even though I prefer Among the Living and Sound of White Noise this Album is solid from start to finish. Songs such as Time, Keep it in the family, Belly of the beast, In my world, and the punkish but yet amazing cover of Joe Jacksons Got the time are simply wonderful. There are some heavy riffs here which just keep pounding until your neck hurts. The sound of this album has a darker feel to it compared to other Anthrax releases but I like it. This happened to be Joey Belladonna`s final album with the band but he made it a great one. All in all a very solid album which is not extremely spectacular at the first listen but it just keeps on growing on you until you can`t do without. Excellent art work by the way. Rock on."
3,"Good album, not their best","This album is typical Anthrax, but performing it at a time where thrash like this was becoming rare. This is one of their better albums, arguably second to only Among the Living. I saw some punk elements mixed in, but all around, good old American metal. One of Bellandonna's best vocal efforts with Anthrax. Songs like ""Blood"", ""Keep it in the Family"", and ""Belly of the Beast"" really make this album good"
5,excellent!,"since i have not heard any of their albums past ""sound of white noise"" i cannot say if this is their best effort. but it is worthy of a five star rating."
2,Disappointing,"I loved all Anthrax up until this one. I listened to it over and over, but I just couldn't find the melodic hooks that filled the other albums. The lyrics were also much more serious. Anthrax had always been socially conscious but with a good sense of humor. POT is lyrically heavy-handed, and the catchiest song is the cover of Joe Jackson's, Got the Time. I think relations within the band were strained by this point. Comparatively not up to par with the previous releases."
1,A CHANGE FOR THE WORSE,"I LISTENED TO ANTHRAX WHEN I HAD FISTFULL OF METAL ON VINYL,AND BELIEVE ME ANTHRAX IS LONG GONE.CHECK OUT THIER OLDER ALBUMS TO FULLY APPRIECIATE THE BAND WHEN THRASH AND SPEED METAL DOMINATED THE SCHOOLYARD.I'D RATE IT LESS IF I COULD."
5,The End of an Era for Anthrax,"I would actually like toy give this album 4.999999 stars. This is by far Anthrax's best produced effort. The album is a departure from the good time thrashing the band had been known for. Instead we see a more focused and angerer Anthrax, spitting forth venomous social and political commentary and telling the world to wake up. This is what makes this album great. One small, minute problem as far as I am concern, the songs. I am not a huge fan of the direction that Anthrax followed after this album. Unfortunately this album shows the signs of that direction. The thrash like songs on this album are wonderful. I love the instrumental ""Intro to Reality"" etc... I just could not accept the rap like songs on the album. However, this does not take away the fact that it is still a great album. This is the last of the Joe Belladonna albums, and the last of the thrash for Anthrax. Check this gem out, and listen to the bands last horah."
4,The best Anthrax album?,"I think so. Far darker than anything prior, and more mature (overall). Joey's vocals even seem to be in a slightly better register, not as piercing as before. The whole band just seemed tight and focused, even though Joey's departure and a whole new sound would emerge within the next two years...The songs are longer than typical for ANthrax, but don't drag. Darker subject matter, written about in a more serious vein than usual, as well. Not that the fun is all gone... the killer cover of Joe Jackson's ""Got the Time"" is an absolute blast, and Frank Bello shows that bass players CAN be a good thing in metal (for once)!Personal favorite, the last track ""Discharge""... an awesome and slightly underrated album. Start here first, then move on to ""Among the Living""."
4,The transition from thrash to real power metal begins,"This I admit is not an album I listened to quite as much as others, but some very strong tracks here, as Joey Belladonna ended his tenure with the band.The band rocks again with Ian anchoring another series of heavy groove from Bello and Benante. ""Time"" and ""Keep it in the Family"" stand out, along with ""In My World.""For me, this album was one you had to sit and really listen to, and it would make that impression that the boys wanted you to get. It did indeed for me."
2,"Scuzzydog, Inc sent only Volume 1","As far as I know, no mention of only a part of ""Agent in Place"" was included in the hardcover. What's up? When opening the hardcover, I found the words: Volume 1. How do I get the rest of story? Order another book? Maybe it will be Volume 2?"
2,Not that great,"This book was a bit of a letdown. It was written rather conversationally, and I think it would have benefited from a good editor's input. It is very very basic, and doesn't really go into any details. It's mostly common sense rather than an actual management plan."
4,So Far . . . So Good.,"I was surprised to see the negative reviews as so far, we all really like this product. It probably makes a difference that I got it on clearance at Wal-Mart, so I only paid $20. It was a gift for my 3 year old daughter yesterday, so it's made it through 2 long days of play. It's gone in our car, to grandmother's house, and has gotten double the use as my 4.5 year old daughter is playing with it too (and she has her own Leapster).I just hope it lasts longer than some of the other raters. I imagine the batteries will run out quickly b/c of the lighted and color screen, but I expected that.I'd say go for it, if you do find it cheaper than full retail!Gina in Florida"
2,Don't waste your money!,My daughter recieved this toy for a Christmas gift and it is junk. It is nothing like it is portrayed in the television commercial. The batteries pop out so you are constantly unscrewing the back plates to pop them back in place. The color display on the screen is horrible. You can't tell what the colors are. The screen gets jammed up so you have to turn off the toy and take out the cartridge to unfreeze the screen. No wonder I saw this toy on sale at Walmart for 50% off the day after Christmas!
1,Great concept; not well executed,"I was so excited to get this for my 3 1/2 year old daughter for Christmas. Initially, it seemed to be a great toy. She enjoyed it and used it quite a bit. However, I had to change the batteries the next day (and 6 batteries are required); but was ok with that. A few days after that, I had to change the batteries again. By then, when I spent some time with it, noticed that on the color by numbers, you can't even read the numbers! By the third time I had to change the batteries in a week, I was beginning to get a little upset. At that point, the stylus was not working properly and would not work on most of the selections. I finally decided to return it today and am very happy that I did. It really is a disappointment and should have been better thought out."
2,"Good Idea, Poor Execution, Disney Missed The Mark.","I bought this for my son for Christmas, he enjoyed it Christmas day and by evening it was working off and on. It seems as though the batteries bounce out of place and the unit looses power. I took it back today and got another figuring we just got a bad one. Got home and put the batteries in again, same thing happened only faster. Now I've got a five year old crying for Nemo. It seemed like a great idea for a toy, with the print option, but it's definitely not worth the price. This one is going back tommorow along with all the games this time. Going to get a Leapster instead."
1,This toy is not durable! Not recommended!,"This toy lasted two weeks with my 3 year old and then suddenly stopped working. We have had many similar toys (Leapsters, Gameboys, etc) that have lasted years. This was a major disappointment. The games also seemed limited and not very educational. I do not recommend this toy. A better choice would be a Leapster (which we exchanged ours for)."
1,I can't believe that Disney endorsed this product!,"I am taking my third dream sketcher back within 3 months. They all broke! I thought I could overlook the lack of quality in the screen but can't overlook the poor quality of the mechanics. The only problems it....I am still out the money for the cartiridges since it is over the timelimit. If you are reading this, don't waste your money."
1,1 star is too good,My husband and I can't believe that Disney would endorse such a poorly made over priced toy. We bought two of them for our boys and they just like the other reviews might have worked for 15 minutes. I would love to have the money that was invested in them back. Now I do not buy a new toy unless I can find reviews on it.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"I HAVE TO SAY I AGREE WITH EVERYONE ELSE, WE BOUGHT THIS NOT ONCE BUT TWICE I WAS CONVINCED THEY DROPPED THE FIRST ONE AS IT TRULY WORKED FOR 15 MINUTES. LIKE EVERYONE ELSE I TRIED CHANGING THE NAME BRAND BATTERIES, SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT , MY DAUGHTER WAS SO EXCITED TO GET THIS NOW IT JUST SITS THERE BROKEN WITH ITS 3 CARTRIDGES, BIG WASTE OF MONEY!"
2,Don't Buy This Sketcher,"Do Not Buy This Toy!!! It was decent for a 2.5 yr old, even with its bad graphics, but it won't last. All of the reviews that gave this toy a bad review are correct. Batteries don't last, poor graphics (can't distinguish between colors & paint by numbers are so small you can't make them out), just stopped working after 2 days."
1,Very Disappointed,"We bought this to keep our daughter occupied in the car during long trips. She loves to do electronic coloring on the computer, the Disney software was appealing and the reviews were all good, so we were very excited about this toy. However, after unboxing and putting batteries in it, we are very disappointed in the product. The screen image is terrible -- you can hardly distinguish colors and the pixilation is very bad. The pre-loaded software only has 10 coloring pages. The dot to dot game doesn't have the child follow numbers or letters so it has absolutely no educational value. We were not able to test the additional Princess cartridge we bought without tearing opening the packaging, but even if the software was great it would'nt overcome the terrible screen image. The images look nothing like the one on the packaging. This toy is going back to the store tomorrow. It was a great premise, but poorly done."
1,HAD HIGH HOPES!,"I HAVE TO AGREE WITH THE REVIEWER THAT WAS DISAPPOINTED WITHTHIS PRODUCT. IT HAD SO MUCH POTENTIAL FOR GREAT FUN. BUT, THESCREEN IS FUZZY. IT EVEN SAYS ON THE BACK OF THE BOX ""SCREENIMAGES USED FOR REPRESENTATION ONLY.""(THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS CARDBOARD PICTURE STUCK ON THE FRONT OF THE TOY TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT IT WILL LOOK LIKE WHEN TURNED ON). IT CONTINUES TO SAY ""ACTUAL IMAGES ON SCREEN MAY VARY IN PIXELATION"". AT LEAST THEY ARE HONEST. TO PAY OVER $50 FOR THEMAIN UNIT AND $15 FOR EACH CARTRIDGE IS WAY TOO MUCH FOR THEQUALITY. LEAPSTER AND PIXTER ARE MUCH BETTER QUALITY AND MUCHMORE EDUCATIONAL IN ADDITION TO GOOD FUN."
3,Cheesy...but my son loves it!,"We bought this toy on sale for a pretty good price. My youngest son is Mickey Mouse crazy so we bought it just for that reason alone. I must say that compared to the Leapster (which my children LOVE) it is very basic and the graphics are really grainy and the colors not that vibrant. But, having said that, my boys (age 3 & 5) love playing with this. We have since bought two additional cartridges (Nemo and Toy Story...also on sale) and they really seem to enjoy them. They love downloading the pictures to the computer and printing them out...a nice feature. The Leapster, however, wins hands down in this house. But, I must say that this was not money wasted. It does eat through the batteries (6 AAs!)so rechargables are a must. But, I would not recomend this one at full price. The basic leapster handheld is about the same price and much more versitle and educational!"
1,Doesn't work NOT BUY!,"I wish I had read the other reviews before buying. This toy worked great for 2 days and that is it. It freezes up on screens, sometimes the touch screen does not respond and thats if it even turns on.The only thing this toy was successful in doing was breaking my sons heart! Do not waste your time or money buying this piece of garbage."
1,worst toy ever,I bought this for my granddaughter who is at the house frequently. This toy worked for a short time and then would not even turn on. I sent it back to the manufacturer who responded with no help and sent it back claiming it to be repaired. It again worked for a very short time and then back to the same problems. Buy a leap frog leapster. Much better graphics and reliable. The graphics on the dream sketcher are poor at best.
4,Loving it!!!,"My daughter got this from Santa this year for Christmas and loves it. We have had only one minor problem with it. Exactly one week after opening it the screen froze up and went off and would not come back on. I took it to our local Toys R Us to exchange it for a new one and got so much grief from the clerks just to exchange it for a new one. After approx 45 mins. they agreed to exchange it. We got this one home put batteries in it and it is working great. My daughter loves to color and draw all the time so this dream sketcher has saved us so much paper, and I love the fact that she can just print out her works of art. Had more problems with Toys R Us with the exchange than we have with this toy. I would recommend this toy, just beware if you have to exchange it!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"I purchased the Disney Dream Sketcher for my daughter's for Christmas. If you don't have stock in batteries, I suggest you do not buy this toy. There is no other options for powering up this toy other than batteries. The graphics are terrible and I could of spent the money on something much better and more durable. Very disappointed this was backed by Disney. Nobody could have tested this toy because it would have never passed inspection. The batteries are hard to replace and it's not easy to operate."
1,Sucks up batteries and never works,"We bought this product, three different games, and special ordered a cases for it for our four year old daughter for christmas, because she loves everything Disney and art. (...)What a piece of junk!!! First of all it NEVER works and talk about fuzzy you can hardly even see the picture. It takes six batteries and I mean it actually takes six batteries every time you turn it on!! We buy name brand batteries. I have never left a review for any product that I have bought, but this was such a awful product it needed a comment. Rach Montgomery"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS. THIS TOY DOES NOT WORK.,My daughter received one for Xmas 2005. Since then we have been back to the toy store 2 separate times for a replacement unit. All 3 units we've tried just DO NOT WORK PROPERLY. Will be going back tonite to get my money back! What a joke -- this piece of junk was almost $50!
1,Very bad purchase!,"I am in agreement with those who say do not waste your moeny on this! The screen quality, when it worked was poor.The batteries run out or whatever the case is and it just never works.I tried to download the pics to print and that didnt work either.This had been a birthday present for my daughter and I am sorry I wasted my money on it."
1,Piece of Junk!!!,"I purchased the Disney Dream Sketcher for $45 for my daughter for Christmas. Immediately the screen kept freezing and I'd have to unscrew the battery doors to reset it. The batteries kept popping up inside their doors even though the doors were on tight. A tiny screw fell out without our noticing and the sketcher no longer worked. I wrote to Jazware to ask them to send me another tiny screw and they never replied. My daughter wanted to play it since she barely used it so I took back the one without a screw and exchanged it for a new one. I told the customer service at the store that the screen kept freezing so they're going to send it back to Jazware. If they would've sent me the screw, I wouldn't have taken it back and they wouldn't have had to eat the cost of it. The new one which I just bought, has already had the screen freeze. DON'T BUY THIS!!"
2,hard on the eyes,"We received this as a gift. I am not impressed. The screen is very grainy and the colors aren't very vibrant. Some of the features work, but you really have to play around with it. We do not have any cartridges yet, so I don't know if that will make a difference. (Although they seem hard to find.)Despite my opinion, my 4 yr old daughter likes and only gets frustrated occaisionally. She keeps calling it Leapster...spend the extra money and go for that!"
4,Classic Anime,"Bubblegum Crisis as much as any other anime, is what brought Anime to the American mainstream. The DVD brings an end to the perpetual subbed vs dubbed argument by allowing you to choose. The animation and story are good and this is a DVD that I rewatch frequently.I do have a few complaints, mostly the packaging. This is not packaged as a DVD, but in normal jewel boxes and packed more like software than as a DVD set. Also, for a series that isn't really very long, it seems strange that the set requires 3 DVDs.Complaints aside, I recommend this series to anime fans."
3,"not too bad, not that great either","The first few episodes were a little confusing. The way the story unfolds is a bit different than most anime. I've seen lots of anime, and this one, I don't really want to re-watch for a while. It lacks that long-term appeal. If you collect anime like I do, then this is ""ok"" to add. Only the last half of the series makes the anime really hold together. So be patient and watch the whole thing.But I'd get some other title before this one.The extras (music videos) were cool. Animation quality is superb, sound quality is ok. Action level is a little weak. Plot, is a little old, a bit weak. The pakaging is not worth mentioning."
2,Not very impressive,"I love anime. My advice to you is if you do buy this suite, only watch the last two DVD's and skip through the weak-@ss music scenes. The animation is awesome but the voices aren't very good. This is a decent title but it's not my style. I recommend Lain, ghost in the shell, DBZ, and anything on cartoon network even though it's edited and not subtitled."
4,Not you parent's cartoon,"Bubble Gum Crisis; a techno-punk spectacle, is a story of four women who become vigilantes in future Tokyo. Using futuristic weapons and body armor they battle the evil forces of the Genma Corporation. Spectacular animation matched with superior characters makes this a staple of Japanese Animation. This original series has spawned others along the line such as ""Bubblegum Crash, and AD Police Files."" New versions of this series have been produced for Japanese television. Although slightly primitive in comparison, Bubblegum Crisis 2048 is an excellent companion to this series."
4,a excellent video and a highly entertaining movie,in short it is an awsome movie and a highly auality work of art and musi
3,Bubblegum Crisis,"A great translation from video. Animation quality is great in the DVD virsion. The down side with the DVD Collector's Suite is the packageing. Instead of using DVD cases, it uses CD cases a bad desion on the company's part, if you want to display them with your other DVD's."
3,Annoying faux French accents,"My child loves Madeline books so I thought what a great idea it would be to listen to Madeline songs in the car. This CD was too annoying for me because of the phony French accents. The 3 year old liked it ok, a few songs more than others. The local library might be getting a donation soon..."
1,poor quality,"I have owned this item for 2 months and the belt clip came out of the case and I almost lost my phone, now I have to put my belt thru the loops on the case. I won't buy another."
3,"For lovers of Antony Trollope, mostly","John Caldigate offers the devoted reader the company of that humane conservative, Antony Trollope. The plot concerns the consequences of misconduct that may or may not have been perpetrated in the far-away goldfields of Australia. Trollope had been there and observed all with a keen eye. As usual, he is good on the situation of a young man who has to learn to live in a world of moral ambiguities."
4,Good System,"We love the Xbox, only problem is once in a while it refuses to read our disks! Have to keep trying to load CD, eventually they are played, but sometimes takes a while, otherwise it's great!"
3,xbox 360 system,just disapointed to find out you have to go thru alot of hassel toplay regular xbox games
4,Xbox360 Core System,"This was one of the ""Customer Vote"" items and for $100 this was a great buy. I personally was holding out on the next-gen consoles because of the price. Thank you Amazon for offering the original first-come-first-serve Customer Vote contest. It is too bad that all of the whiners thought you were BK and wanted to have it there way."
4,not for this price,"like what the other people have said...dont buy for this price, OUCH! Wait for the april shipments and get the premium with 4 games. I own one, the graphics are great, esp. Kameo, and NFSMW BUT I have a HiDef TV and the HiDef cable. I didnt even bother to plug it in until I got my HiDef cable, that is why I bought it!"
1,DUDE IM SELLING MY CAR(NOT),My car is worth about 600$ Im going to buy it and buy a little boxs with a 360 and a x on it much better investment.
1,The dreamcast is better then this!,Stupid system just go away we don't like you. You make babies cry and kids get angrey. We like to play are dreamcast and play Sonic adventure 1 and 2. We don't want to play halo becuse it's a bad game. It is no fun it makes me so angrey. Now go barney the dinosur and never return! MAW MAW MAW MAW MAW MAW MAW MAW MAW MAW MAW MAW MAW GAHHHHHHHHHHHH GAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
1,Smells like chickens!!!,I went into gamestop one day and started to play on the X-box 360 it was terbile the graphics were all fuzzy and then it blinded me and I fell down a well with my chickens and I was stuck for 4 hours. It is soooo much fun buy it. If you are a chicken lover. P.S. This is a insult
1,Xbox tampered with - wtf?,"I am in shock. The Xbox360 was alot of fun until I got the red rings of death. I called Xbox help and they sent a box. I followed the instructions in the box. Took the game out and took off the harddrive. I put the stupid thing in the box and dropped it off at UPS. I got an email a couple of days later saying that it had been shipped back to me. I received it ""unrepaired"" with a letter saying that I violated the Extended Warranty. I called Xbox and they told me it wasn't repaired because I tampered with it. I can't believe it. I never opened it or did anything to it other then mail it. They are cheats completely. The amount of money microsoft is making and they call me a liar instead of fixing it. I could only talk to an Indian guy (he was nice) and all he could tell me is I tampered with it and sorry.MIcrosoft's does not want to take a hit on all these crappily made consoles."
1,Don't Buy this System!!!!!,"This is the first negative review I've ever written. Purchased this system as a gift for the kids last Christmas. First System worked beyond the 30 day return period. Second System worked for a week. Third system never worked! They shipped us a non-working system. We are now on the phone for over 2 hours trying to get a 4th system. The aggravation in trying to get a working system is definitely not worth it! Having invested a ton of money in games, it's a nightmare."
3,Time to phase out this bundle,"I know some people will use the talkikng point of how you can make your Xbox into what you want.Real problem is that it only creates confusion among the fanbase. If Microsoft was truly smart they would drop the three current bundles. 120 HDD is just too much. 20 HDD is not enough. No HDD makes the thing useless.In its place put out a 40 or a 60 HDD unit and make it universal. You really don't need that much hard drive space considering this thing is supposed to be about games.If you truly want to do all the multitasking use your PC since its built alot better to handle those functions than the Xbox 360 is. Also the PC has better hard drives for storing songs, video's and your other media."
3,Don't fall for the hype-wait until some good games are out.,"I bought the 360 in early December even though none of the launch games looked interesting. However, I was interested in DOA4, but when it was finally released at the end of December, the reviews were lukewarm. So I returned it and I'm glad I did. Besides the overheating troubles, there is not a must-play game scheduled for release until possibly Far Cry in late March. After that, the next wave of decent looking games are going to be released in September! My advice is to save your money and wait until more (and better) games are available. By that time, the 360 may even be discounted. Meanwhile, I'm getting caught up on all the PS2 and Xbox games I've been meaning to finish."
4,Xbox 360,"Controler take alittle while to get use to. But other than that graphics are great, games are good, game selection is still not that big."
4,Awesome!,"this thing is awesome, i recommend the premium however cause the core cause with absolutely nothing"
2,Fall Update Warning!!,"This warning is for all potential buyers of any xbox 360. Microsoft recently released an update for their Xbox Live system, however, due to some complications, many 360's are being destroyed by this update. If you plan on buying one do not connect it to the internet until they fix this issue. Otherwise spend your well earned cash on a next gen system that might be a little more stable than the 360 (i.e. the Nintendo Wii or possibly Sony's PS3)."
4,"The game system is fine, Amazon.com is horrible","The game system is fine. Its the fact that your customer service people mislead potential customers into purchasing things that they wouldn't have purchased had they been told the truth. Like I've said many times, you have lost my business. No one from Amazon even has the courtesy to get back to me regarding my concerns. What kind of business do you run?"
4,HOT HOT HEAT,"I bought my xbox 360 about a week ago and so far i am happy with it. It just bought the memory card and it works fine, you do not need to buy the hard drive. The only complaint i have about it is the adapter and the console get way to hot. When i am done playing what I'll do is just unplug the cord so the adapter isn't plugged, getting really hot. It also has really good graphics, even if u don't have a High Definition Tv, cause i don't."
2,cool but not nice,"the bad:i bought my xbox 360 almost 8 months ago on miami and then went back to my country, so the warranty do not work for me.i have a little baby so my xbox 360 usage is very limited (couple of hours only in sundays), at that usage rate my xbox 360 died after 8 months with the three ring of dead, i think for a heavy gammer it would've last a month.i notice that it runs hot, very hot and noisy, my original xbox still work after years so i thought that the 360 would be a good product too, well i was wrong i can believe i got fool for such a crappy system.the good:many of the games have really nice graphics like gears of wars, i had fun with the game play on the wireless controller.conclusioni think if you can buy a extended warranty, then buy the xbox but beware of the pain and suffer from a defective console. I'll wait until microsoft releases a 65nm version that can runs cooler and with less noisy, in the mean time I'll buy a Nintendo Wii"
4,great system.,"Many people are saying dont buy it's horrible. Now if this is your first Xbox i would agree with them. But my Xbox red ringed and I just needed a replacement. I already had Controllers, cables, hard drive, evreying. This is just a system replacement. and for 30.00 used its great! If your like me you could sell the wired controller and the cables on craigs list or ebay. If it's your second 360 I would highly reccomend buying this system."
4,Please read... very important!!,"I ordered this for my husband for the holidays. I couldn't afford the extra $ at the holiday time for the other version of this system. The game system itself it awesome, amazing graphics, new games, ect. IT Is an awesome game system. We are really happy with it!!!WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOUIf you buy this version FORGET saving the games. You have to upgrade the system $79.99 with a memory card.$49.99/each wireless paddle. I have never bought a gaming system that didn't allow you to save a few games (Nintendo etc)Keep it in an open area - so it doesn't overheat!YOU DO NOT GET A GAME WITH THIS $299.99 System, get ready to spend $70 each game!!!IF I would have just paid the extra $100 right away it would have been a must better deal. I spent $190.00 more to get him what I could have gotten in the first place. SO Don't waste your time with the core product just get the one with 2 paddles, and the memory card. You will save in the long run."
2,deadly three red ligths,"I got my xbox 360 on March 2007, and it was very fun while it worked. Sometimes playing fifa 2007 online, the system crashed or the screen freezed a couple of times, and a weird noise came backwards, from the cooling fans of the console, but at that time i thougth it was nothing serious at all. One day planning to play a couple of games, i saw the 3 red fatal ligths blinking on the front ring of the system.When i looked up for a solution on microsofts webpage, it said the system had to be delivered for service repair. It was dead and cant do anymore. The defective coolings fans cause the system to overheat, and killed it.Maybe a system that worths to much should flawlessly work at least for 12 months. It should have better cooling system, better running processor and more working lifetime.Im seriously planning to sell this defective system and get back to basics, PS2 or Nintendo WII."
1,The wrost game systeam ever!,1.Thare have been over 1000 reports of these breaking.2.Thare no fun games on it.3.It dosen't have a cooling fan so It overheats.4.Wroth 1000$ yeah right!5.The graphics have not been changed it is a lie.6.If you download music on it It deystroys game deta.7.You are forced to buy the right tv on it for right grpahics that have not been changed!Everybody has a good reason to hate this systeam don't buy it unless you relly belive this !@#$. Start a angrey mob agenist microsoft!!!
2,Should i be concerned??,"I just recently bought an Xbox 360, and all i'm readind so far is how terrible the system is!!! about overheating and all sorts of scary reviews!!!, should i be scared?? i hope not, this system is suppose to bring good quality, and good clean fun, but it's incredible how bad the reviews are!!!! i'm really looking forward to opening this console and start playing, but i'll never understand, why this little phenom is ocurring, well if this is true, Microsoft should definitely do somethig, cause it's a rip off to the gaming world!!!!!! jajaja, peace out.Te Amo Mami, con todo eres mi fuente de inspiracion y fortaleza!!!!"
1,The Eds made it?,Sertinlly edd ed N eddy helped with this. After buying the systeam I haven't played it since january. The systeam has extremly poor qulity and just can't do what you want it to do. If you play a x-box game on it it will refuse to read it. The systeam also burned up and the gears inside it have stuck to the sides of it and just will not come out. Ugggggh micriosoft is so dumb. I'll admit your computers are good but work on the x-box 460 for the up coming years becasue a 360 is a faluire. PS3 will be out in winter(due to delays)microsoft realsed this to early just so thye would look so cool. Liars don'rt by this junk!
1,NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE,"If you are like me, a father just trying to make his child happy, DO NOT BUY THIS!First, there are no Childrens titles for the 360. Maybe in a few years there will be some.Second, this console IS NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE with most games. Check the Microsoft site and they will confirm this (about 15 levels deep into the X-Box site). However, no where in the XBox manual do they tell you this.Third, Toys R Us will sell you Xbox games(not 360) and claim they will work with the new X-Box. They simply do not! In the rare case they do work, you must first download and install a software patch! DOES THIS MAKE ANY SENSE!!Finally, the XBox 360 is a decent DVD player and has great graphics for those with HDTV and the hookups (MS supplies the component cables).I was a huge fan of Microsoft until this product. Don't waste your money. Also, don't waste your child's time."
1,1000 + dollars!,"WHY?!. For that much you could get your self a nice custom gaming PC, mouse, keyboard, and monitor with COD 2. I don't understand why anyone would pay that much for gaming console."
1,"***AVOID THIS PRODUCT*** 2 Dead Boxes in 1 year, Xbox has only 3 months warranty!!!",Another bad product from Microsoft! I am dumb enough to buy another new box after the first one died within 5 months of purchase. The second one just went dead on me today! I haven't played much at all (may be an hour max a week). The product has only 3 months warranty. I am gonna switch over to PS3 or Wii ASAP and will never buy Microsoft game console again.
1,Very Bad Hardware Quality,"I bought this system on December 2006 and on April 2007 it was toast. My house has a central air conditioner system so it's always 24C. It broke with 3 red lights of death and I lost all my money, because I bought it in the US and I brought it to Venezuela. To fix it I would have to spend more money that buying a new one, so screw MS, such an expensive console should not break in less than 5 months. I loved the console, while it worked, but so many people are having this same problem because the console heats up too damn much. No extra fan solution is good enough. Buy something else, keep away from bad quality products like this."
3,Go for the better xbox,"You're probably looking at this because you want the Xbox 360, and want the cheaper system. I recommend going with the more expensive versions. The core system includes only the console, a wired controller, and a couple other items but does not come with any type of game saving memory mechanism, making it of limited use. Buying a hard drive or memory card (hard drive is better) at about $90 (almost what u would have paid for the more expensive version. The more expensive version comes with a bunch more goodies that are pretty much vital to your gameplay and enjoyment of the console. I ended up spending more money to get the accessories that would have just come with the better 360.Purchase the 360 with a hard drive - it will actually save you money,"
5,The 360 can crash?!,"You know I actually got this as a gift last year and have had in since i got around 7 or 8 games like Oblivion, Call of Duty, and PGR. And never once have I had a crash or shut off thingy i do only play about maybe 10 hours a day ;) ,but not once has it crashed. I dont know maybe i got the one that works but if you give the system time to rest I don't think it should crash. Also some advice grab that 3 power enginee fan ""intercooler"" i think its called works awsome(little loud but does enhance system's life) So other then that its a great gift for us and adults too."
1,Charging 1000 dolars for a 360 is obscene,How can people out here even think to list an x box 360 for $1000 when it's hard to get a system at a local store. Amazon should NOT support NOR list people trying to pimp the consumer by listing ungodly prices for an obviously under-distributed product. What? You think microsoft didn't know that hundreds of thousands of people would be looking for the 360 right away??? Please. This is microsoft- they do more market research than pharmecutical companies... The FTC should give them a fat ticket...
1,Disappointed....,"Well this may be a system that fun to play, but the life span is too short. The very first one broke in a year. i was thinking the new 360 should be better. Same thing, it broke in a year as well, and i barely used it. Since i had spent $400 for this system, i called the customer service to hope that i can get a fair deal. I was told i have to pay $140 to get it fix, i believed not include the shipping. I have 3 Xbox with 2 not function, i am not going to spent a penny on Xbox anymore.If you want to buy this system, pay extended warranty. Or get a PS/Nintendo, my Super Ninetendo which i own for 15 years still working fine; so do the PS."
2,another nice one for fans,"Crazy World is about on the same level as Savage Amusement for me. It's a good CD for Scorpion fans, but to a widespread general audience it's probably just the album that contains the hit Wind Of Change. Never able to recapture the brilliance of Love At First Sting, this one continues the Scorps' downward slide from the top of their game. I like this CD enough to keep it as a part of my collection because I really like the band, but after the first few tracks I usually get bored and listen to something else. My favorite tracks include: Tease me Please Me, To Be With You in Heaven, Wind of Change, Kicks After Six."
3,Wind Of Change,"This is their album containing the famous and wonderful "" Wind Of Change "", I also like the Tease Me Please Me,To Be With You In Heaven and Send Me An Angel but the other songs are not that great.Overall the album is not as necessary laudy,noisy and hard for a metal album."
1,I'M GETTING OLDER...,"I'm getting older. I can't understand how some people liked this CD. It is very bad compared to others Scorpions albums from the 70's and beginning of the 80's.This CD is just horrible. Here in BRazil, the song ""Wind of Changes"" have been used for the soundtrack of soap-operas in TV ! Look the title of the tracks in the album: ""TO be With You in HEaven"", ""Lust or Love"".. etc. Compare it with older songs like ""We'll Burn the Sky"", ""Fly to the Rainbow"", ""Pictured Life"".. what a shame ! Bring Ulrich Roth back!"
5,Final proof,"Hope no more for Anastasia! This book details all the evidence about the death of the Romanov family and finally, using DNA, proves that all those who claimed to be Anastasia were not. Great read from start to finish."
2,Meh!,"This book was a big fat disappointment which added nothing new to the knowledge of the fate of the Romanovs. The bulk of the first half of the book concerns itself more with describing squabbles among the various scientists researching the matter than with providing historical or scientific facts. I had the feeling that the author did not have any real information and mostly just blew smoke. Additionally, at the time of publication, two of the bodies had not yet been recovered, so it could hardly be correct to call the book ""The Final Chapter."" The second half (the entire second half!) of the book dealt with the claim of Anna Anderson. It could have been handled by a few sentences, as in: DNA proved Anna Anderson was NOT Anastasia. Budda Boom, Budda Bing! Crummy, clumsy book, unworthy of an author who has otherwise written so brilliantly on Imperial Russian history."
3,Not as good as his other work,"I loved ""Catherine The Great"" and ""Nicholas And Alexandra"", and had read in the reviews that this book finished the Romanov story. I read it as soon as I finished ""Nicholas And Alexandra"". Unfortunately, it is nowhere as good as the first two books I've read by Mr. Massie. It is much less about the Romanov's, and more about the 20th Century work in determining if the skeletal remains found are, in fact, those of the Romanovs. In addition, it goes into great length about the people who have claimed to be Anastasia. Is this interesting? Well, a little. But, I got tired of the chase after awhile. This is not a bad book. However, it is not in the same league as the others I've read by Mr. Massie."
3,Minimal Subject Matter,"Having read mr. Massie's.Nicholas and Alexander and his book on Peter the Great. He is a wonderful writer who makes history lively and understandable. Thinking we could discuss both the Romanovs and the Russian Revolution, plus I could find out the final judgment on the bodies, I chose this book for my book club.To my surprise, this book is only about the DNA and narrative of how the bones were found and analyzed. Because he is a very good writer, this material is surprisingly readable. Just be aware that is about it."
3,Interesting insight into this family and what lead to there demise but handicapped by the lack of historical letters.,Many letters were destroyed by the family when they were coming under siege. Thus many assumptions were made and the depth of the story line somewhat hampered.
4,This is great,I gave this book four stars. This is very interesting and gives more insight to what really happened. I love reading about history and this brings it to life. If you like history and want to learn about events in the past you need to read this one.
5,Definitive Answers About What Happened to the Romanovs,"In this book, the author totally convinces the reader that the Romanovs were indeed murdered and their bones positively identified through scientific means. The author also proves to the reader that Anna Anderson, who posed as the duchess Anastasia, was an impostor. There is also some interesting information on living Romanov heirs who believe that the monarchy will be reestablished in Russia. I would recommend this book to those interested in Russian history."
4,Good,"The first part was boring with the DNA and blah, blah (maybe because I was 11) but the Anna Anderson part, Imposters and Survivors was cool. It took a lot of work for RKM to interview the real royalty and piece everything together. The pictures were great. But whose missing? I know Alexei (Alexis) is missing (he was burned) but Tatiana, Marie, or Anastasia. Now they're saying Marie is missing...Nicholas and Alexandra was much better, but describing the deaths in the two books was different."
3,For those who are fans of Russian history,Many details may be found in massie Nicholas and Alexandra. Most fascinating are the whereabouts of the remaining family members and their careers today.
3,Romanovs redux,A sad human story made less interesting and moving by a very well (goo well?)researched investigation of every facet of the discovery of the bodies and the authentication of them not to mention chapter and verse on the egomania of those litigators fighting to try and profit from it all. Finally of interest probably to mad still-existing pretenders to the imperial crown.
4,DNA in History,"I pulled this one off the bookshelf and read for a second time after several years. This time I took notes to keep the historical characters and the DNA information straight. I learned a lot about DNA. This is a very scholarly and well researched exploration of the historical aftermath of the massacre of the Romanov family. Sure to intrigue forensic buffs. Imagine the complications of reconstructing an act of murder/assassination (which one was it?) which took place in the context not only of revolution, but of successive governments and overlapping authorities. Add the morphing views of generations over 70 years. Throw in professional jealousy on a global scale, as well as some quirky personalities, all on the cusp of knowledge regarding the forensic use of DNA. A really interesting history which brings the past up to the present."
4,Wrong edition for class but it worked,I bought the wrong edition for my History of Psychology class but the studies were exactly the same for the most part. For the four (ish) that were different I just Googled the ones this edition didn't include. Very interesting read!
5,Interesting,"Interesting text, clear concise and good textbook for any psych class. Great summaries and background information on studies and researchers."
4,Psychology 101 review,"This is a very good book to review some of the most important studies in psychology. Good for intro psyc students, and for those who are interested in human mind and behavior."
5,A good crash course on psychology,"This book is a great crash course into the studies that made psychology famous (infamous?). For psychology students, most of these stories will be familiar, but they are delved into in good detail with the hindsight that only time can give you. A great reference book for those in and not in the field."
3,Bought for class in college,My oldest daughter had to have this text book for a class in college. The book is boring but I guess it has to do with the subject matter.
4,Got an A,My son and I looked for this book even used it was expensive at Barnes & Noble. My son received this book on time to do his project and got an A
4,good,this book came on time. it was in great shape. i would recommend to anyone this company. very good customer service
3,Forty Studies that Changed Psychology: Explorations into the History of Psychological Research (6th Edition,Arrived within a few days of purchase. Great price compared to other found on the internet. thanks for the timely turn around.
5,Don't sell your book,"This is a great book. If you are an undergraduate, don't sell your book. YOu may think you've heard about these studies and you wouldn't refer back to the book, but I wish I hadn't sold mine. They are the landmark studies that I keep wishing I could use for a paper, and will probably be on the GRE. Little Albert afraid of every furry thing, Bandura's learning through observation, and even some Freud, though he didn't really do any studies and it ticked off my prof that he was in there. I'm now re-buying the book because there have been too many times I've wished I've had it since the class was over a semester ago."
1,disappointment,I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS COMPANY BECAUSE I ORDER THIS PRODUCT ON AUG 23 AND TODAY IS SEP 4 MORE THAN 10 DAYS AND THE PRODUCT WASN'T SHIPPED YET. NO E-MAIL OR ANY PRONUNCIATION WAS MADE BY THE COMPANY
4,Good enough!,It is good enough. The paper's quality is not good like the one I saw at school but it's cheaper and it actually doesn't matter if you can keep the book carefully.And it's a good book for studying Psychology.Brand new and delivery fast!!
2,Hard to see!,"The concept of the design is nice, but the hands are very hard to see under the word Quidditch! Not a watch you can quickly glance at to see what time it is. I'm not impressed. The word 'Quidditch' should have been on the faceplate of the watch itself, under the hands, and not on the glass covering; or the hands should be well defined and easier to see."
4,"Catchy, Futuristic, Funky & Smart","Great to see YMO's stuff out on CD - I had this (and a pair of their other releases) on vinyl when I was in middle school, and after many years, it's still great stuff. YMO stood alongside some of the Krautrock groups (especially Kraftwerk and Can) as something way ahead of their time, and Ryuichi Sakamoto has crafted an extremely fascinating solo career over the last 2 decades.In any case, the shimmering electro-pop here was immaculate - catchy, futuristic, funky and smart.Check 'em out.-David Alston"
1,Another STINKEROO!,"You'd really have to be desperate to waste time on this one. One of the worst Alamo films of all time, unless you count THIRTEEN DAYS TO GLORY. (Gaaaggghhh) Historical accuracy is just not there! Decent acting, absent. Believeable plot, dead on arrival.I've heard of B-grade Westerns, but this one doesn't even come close. If you are a glutton for punishment, go for it. Just don't operate heavy machinery after watching this bilge, you'll be too mind numbed."
3,Slightly disappointing,I did like the book overall but some of the assumptions of the book were not well backed up.
2,Not a page flipper,I purchased this book awhile back(over 3 months ago) and had not completed it yet. I have read several other books though on the same subject matter....Hmmm...
5,"Thanks to you, I am Single, Saved, and NOT Having Sex!!!","What I love most about this book is in Chapter 5 where you give powerful, pratical steps to overcome sexual temptations. In my struggle for many years as a single woman, I have searched but never have found such a profund book like this one that is direct, candid and uplifting as this one. For a taboo subject on sex, many never even scractch the surface, but you have really hit the head of the nail! I highly recommend this book, it's a must to anyone who have a struggle or addiction to sex. It will both inspire and educate you and give you the strength and the willpower to uphold the Word of God. It will leave you with the attitude of accomplishment and inner peace. It will truly bring joy to your life, knowing that the joys of sex can be wonderfully explored in the santity of marriage. Don't prolong your suffering, get this book TODAY!"
3,Honest and Kind of In your Face,I've had this book since 2003. And I decided yesterday to pick it up and give it another chance. I was never really a sexually promiscuous person but at the time I was sexually active so not really into what she was saying. The book is very open and honest and if you are struggling with sexual sin then this is the book to read.As SINGLE Christians this is one of the hardest things to deal with. Sexual Sin is running rampant in Christians.It is one of the hardest things to deal with because as long as we live we have to live with the flesh and the flesh is of the natural man.At some points the book came off as being judgmental. I thought for a second she was going to Damn everybody to hell for ever THINKING of another person.The book has some good points but some of the references she has in the book she needed to give the source of where the information came from.Overall a pretty good book if you are struggling with this problem.
3,Not bad...,"I found the title provocative, and her conversational style, okay. There were some definite hard hitting things in the book, and great information for those who don't know or was not sure, in this book it is well defined. There were a few aspects of the book that I did not like, but not enough to give the book a bad review. I would suggest reading it for yourself. There will be some nuggets for you to grab hold to."
2,It's a Fake Eloise,"My daughter and I love Eloise (as written by Kay Thompson). This is a pale comparison which uses some of the same language from the original book but without any of the grace or wit. The authors use the characters, but miss all of the humor and rhythm that make Eloise, Eloise. A great big bleah and it goes into the pile of books that mommy won't read."
4,Very readable,"This book is a great way to get to know the people of Genesis. I think the author sometimes interjects some opinions needlessly, but it isn't overbearing. Very good read."
1,The book full of poison,"I completely agree with the previous two one-star reviews. This is a book of poison. Not a single Bible character has been left un-smeared. God is not an exception. For the first time in my life do I face a situation when I don't know what to do with a book I don't like: I cannot sell it, I cannot even share it with my friends or with anybody, because it is poisonous. I could destroy it. However, the second [part of the book is an English translation of Genesis. Therefore, as a religious person I cannot do it either. A lose-lose situation!"
5,WILLING TO FREE YOURSELF FROM A MYTH?,"WILLING TO FREE YOURSELF FROM A MYTH? READ CAREFULLY THIS BOOK, AND KAREN ARMSTRONG WILL SHOW YOU THAT, IF YOU THINK THE BIBLE IS THE WORD OF GOD, IT IS NO MORE THAN THE WORDS OF MANY MEN THAT THOUGHT AND FELT THEMSELVES AS GODS. AND MANY OTHERS, ALONG THE YEARS, TURNED THOSE TALES INTO SACRED WRITINGS THAT WERE TRANSMITED TO THE WESTERN SOCIETY AS SUCH, FOR HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF YEARS... READ IT, PROOF IT, PROFIT IT. DAVI GONCALVES, Ph.D."
4,A Struggle with God,"The brilliant Armstrong begins her book with a description of the well known ""wrestle with God"". This theme pervades the book and gives the reader some hope, that our own struggles in the search for God are not in vain. She presents through a reexamination of Genesis, that the book is not what it may seem at first reading. Our reading of this first book of the bible is colored by our religious training, and this is a fresh and welcome relook. Definately worth the read. My only criticism is that there is not enough, there could have been more evaluation and footnotes. She closes her book with the first book itself, which transforms before our eyes after reading her thoughts. Highly recommended"
4,O Porto,"Profunda, armoniosa, mistica, provoca sensación océanica,ideal para introspección.Muy buen álbum."
4,HONK! The little musical that could...,"What a funny musical! I was in this play in Michigan, and I didn't think much of title at first. But as soon as the music hit my ears, I knew the crowd would love it. This recording is definitely a record that anyone who saw or is in the play should have. The vocals are amazing, as well as the music. I am pretty sure that this is the cd that people putting on HONK! would have. HONK! is a delightfully funny musical that any playgoer would enjoy."
5,Great production,This is one of the few available recordings of this musical. My girls loved it and learned their songs from it. What more can I say? It's Honk!
2,The Cuteness Runs Thin...,"While this musical starts out strong, I find that it quickly becomes nothing more then another obnoxious musical that uses poor rhymes and flat music to tell the story of the Ugly Duckling. Yet, there is indeed another problem. Whose story is this? Uglys or his mothers? Well, the authors surely didn't make a choice and neither did the director of the production I saw. I also find Act incredibly drawn out and then Act 2 it was as if hte authors realized they needed to wrap up the story. Not to mention the last song (Look at him Reprise) is probably the worst song of them all. (All the splender of a noble swan/ from a duck into a paragon) What kid knows what paragon means? anyone. Overall it was a good try, but falls short. Thought I'd say a good show for a low budget..."
2,You can't judge a CD by its cover either,"I usually enjoy Putumayo compilations very much, but ""Asian Groove"" turned out to be a major disappointment. It is described as a blend of South Asian music, electronica, and funk. The comments I read about it persuaded me to expect a CD in which one could find danceable songs with a traditional Hindi music influence. But most of the tracks come across as adult contemporary world music. One hears more jazz than funk, and most would be pretty difficult to dance to. The Punjabi bhangra music mixed with electronic dance beats have proven very popular and danceable in the UK. Someone looking for South Asian-influenced dance music would be better off with a CD from that musical genre. ""Asian Groove"" makes for pleasant, fairly interesting background music, but alas, not much else."
5,A Doorway to World Music!!,"For those who are unsure about the vitality of world music, give them this CD. It does a fantastic job of showing how danceable, yet musical, this music can be. I have heard a few Putumayo CD's before this one, and most have a few good tracks, but are not worth purchasing. This one is a definite exception. Every track shines, from the intro ""Pheli War,"" which combines Indian and English vocals, to the final ""Aankh Naal"" which will force you onto the dancefloor. Mo' Horizons shows why they are a force to be reckoned with, with the funky ""Remember Tomorrow,"" while Deepak Ram delivers some amazing flute on his ""A Night in Lenasia."" Who needs drugs when you have music this fine to put you into that trance? This CD will certainly cause an addiction, but one of the good kinds. Try it and you'll see what I mean."
2,Pleasant collect for casual listening,"A so so collection of World Music.Repeated listening highlights some annoying cliché tracks and others that are quite enjoyable.While not being a ""must have' album, it provides an OK introduction to a variety of artists, which if you like can explore further."
3,Not the best,This putumayo cd I felt was lacking something that I expected. It was ok but I dont listen to it that much really. Not quite sure what it is however. Preview the clips before buying it.
1,Boring,"Cray sings lyrics, which should be loaded with emotion, but unfortunately are not. For example,"" The forecast calls for pain."" is recited with the conviction a devote catholic would impart to a reading of the Koran. His affect is so bland that I repeatedly forget I had the record on?!? Oh its over ... thank god now I can return it."
3,Disappointed,I was disappointed with the quality of music. There are only a few tracks I care for. The sound quality changes so much from each track and I have a lot of compilation and this is not generally the case. I would not purchase any hi-fidelity house or lounge cd again. The Music Dude
1,What.....................,DO NOT GET THIS CD!! It's a disappointment. At first I thought it was actually NSYNC singing but it was some group called.....the united boys? It's not worth your money. If you wanna listen to NSync....get their CD.
1,NO!!!!!!,"I have no idea who sang this but as soon as I listened to it I wanted to return it!!! It's just...YUCK!!! I mean who ever did this probably did it for good but it doesn't sound good. It's sad to hear a group try to sound like Nsync, I mean come on. NO ONE CAN EVER SOUND LIKE NSYNC!!! But these guys, sheesh. I'm not BSB biggest fan but they sure sing a heck of a lot better than those on this CD. Me and my friend Rae can sound better than those guys. I would advise you NOT to buy this CD. It would be a sad waist of your $mula$."
1,how does this help?,"Absolutley no help for the lazy students, this book is filled with foolish stratigies that only help semi-enthused students make class more enjoyable. The techniques found in the book require at a fair amount of interest in a class. In no way could this book help a student that isnt motivated to work in school. For example, the first section is filled with ways to con a teacher into devoting their time into a mindless/useless class discussion. In what way is this motivating?"
5,THis is GOOD,I am very happy my book was cheap and i got it new i would purchased more books from here
1,Missing pages,The book has many missing pages. I don' think its ethic to sell books like that. The other book that I bougt are ok exept this one
3,Its in pretty good shape,I thought it was on pretty good shape. it wasnt brand new and it did say good shape. it got here pretty quick i just know this book will get my job done.
4,Looks nice on a shelf . . .,"Flimsy but the detail is decent, especially on the leg joint, the range of which impressed me having last owned a Ninja Turtle in the 80s. Some of the clip-in pieces are just flimsy, though. The skullcap (removable to rotate the ""eye"") for instance comes off if you breath on it too hard. Also most of the weapons are attached to right hand pieces so you can't do much with his left hand. I can't see my kid playing with this, and for the price I really had hoped for more.Looks neat, but not much of a toy, basically."
3,No one can ever replace Danny Kaye with this material...,"I had the opportunity to listen to Didi's versions of these wonderful songs and unfortunately it fails to capture the energy, emotion and vision of Danny Kaye's original recordings. I was lucky enough to discover that a friend of mine had a cassette of the Original LP (with all the pops and clicks) and so I decided to remastered the cassette and put it onto a CD. It brings back such incredible memories and sounds really great. Hopefully someone will one day re-release the original classic on CD. No fault to Did. I guess if you haven't experienced the original versions done by Danny Kay... it's OK, but Kaye's shoes are some ""big ones"" to fill. :o ) 3 stars for effort."

1,didn't really review it,i haven't listened to this recording of danny's songs. i am trying to get a copy of danny's recording of these songs. i grew up with it and love it. can anyone tell me if they have found it somewhere?
5,Turns shower time into fun time,My Son loves this stuff. A bottle lasts him about 20 showers or so. It smells good but not fantastic but he loves the foam and it makes shower time fun for him.
3,Saint Etienne - Join Our Club,"JOIN OUR CLUB may seem like just a catchy come-on from Saint Etienne, but membership certainly has its benefits (like fan club-only releases). The single itself gets a peppy mix from Billy Nasty. ""People Get Real"" is a bass-driven call to action, and the B-side, ""Scene 93"" is less a complete song and more an exploration of ambient reverb. Given his evidence, there's certainly no reason not to join."
4,Valhalla Slowly Rising,"This new book by Cussler starts slower than others for a reader of all the Dirk Pitt novels. It seems a bit too familiar thus a little lackluster for my adventure books. As usual half way through the pace picks up and the action starts moving. This story has some twist and turns form his previous novels, one being the way the villian is disposed of and the other being the surprise ending. Its because of this ending that I'm anxious to read the next Dirk Pitt novel."
4,Always a good read anyway,"Clive Cussler was not at his best with this book.. The historic part that he always starts his books with is always very interesting and it is fun to see how it fits in with the story. However, in his last book, Atlantis Found, he had Dirk and Al ready to settle down (marry?) with their lady loves but in this book they have changed their minds. Huh? Come on Mr Cussler let them retire and have a life - bring back Kurt Austin and pal..Have Dirk take over NUMA (The Admiral could retire)...And that last small chapter? Whatever were you thinking?? That was a bit too much for this faithful reader."
4,The price of oil in America,"Cussler continues his streak of creative adventures that entertain. I enjoyed this one because of the Viking subplot and the idea of pre-Columbian visitors to the Americas. Cussler seems to get on another of his soapboxes with the main plot of oil consumption in America. His thoughts will only offend the rich oil companies and make the rest of us nod in agreement. Then out of the blue, Pit gets the surprise of his life ant the end of the book. I look forward to the next installment to see how this thread unfolds."
1,Unbelievable,"The characters are not believable. The main plot line of evil business trying to take over the world helped by evil ex-special forces heavies, has been done to death. Cussler left out the Holy Grail, but managed to sneak in about every other cheesy, implausible plot element. All the credibility and technical sophistication of a Batman comic book."
3,Valhalla Rising,"I have read all of Clive Cussler's books. Valhalla Rising did not exactly match my expectations. Dirk Pitt seems to be getting old and the pace of his adventures slowing down. Yet Clive Cussler remains one of my favorite authors, and I look forward to reading Cussler's next novel."
4,Typical Cussler,"If you like Cussler, you will enjoy this book. No surprises, just good, entertaining reading."
2,got worse,"The book was intriguing at the beginning. I got hooked with the historical prologues and even the beginning events of the story. But starting with the New York plane chase it went downhill rapidly. The whole Cerberus plot to monopolize oil seemed to appear out of nowhere and then ended just as quickly. Dirk Pitt's constant hero acts became less and less plausible as he and NUMA basically take over the jobs of the FBI, police, Coast Guard, Special Forces, and Justice Department. And the dialogue at some points is just horrible. Authors should know by now to write dialogue that is more conversational. Very little of Cussler's dialogue in this book is conversational.Overall I found the book a huge disappointment and found myself skimming entire pages toward the end just to get it overwith. I don't think Cussler is a bad author, I just think he needs to cut the cheesy lines and also come up with a plot that doesn't make Dirt Pitt seem like the second coming of Jesus Christ."
2,Not Cusslers best,"Like many other reviewers, I can honestly say this one has its cheesy moments. The whole Viking thing comes out of nowhere barely making a connection to the story. You're fumbling through looking for a connection that just isn't there. The ""magic"" briefcase had me cringing as well. It felt like Cussler had a long chat with William Shatner the night before writing that in. The ending has a suprise twist that was as predictable as it was cheesy. Not recommended as your first Cussler to read. If you plan to read Trojan Odyssey, however cheesy, the ending is a must read, there's some important character intros."
2,Meh. (from a non-Cussler-reader),"I'd like to give it 2 1/2 stars, actually. It's not as bad as 2, but it sure doesn't rate 3.Not bad, I guess, for an adventure novel. The prose is fairly ham-fisted, though--if you're looking for a well-*written* novel, you won't want to read this one. I didn't much care for the author's cameo (it seemed more like a piece of fantasy-fulfillment than a legitimate plot/character device), but those who read a lot of Cussler might enjoy it.It's an interesting story with some pretty clever ideas driving the plot, but the characters really aren't much more than cardboard cutouts."
2,Cussler has Bottomed Out !!!,"I have been a fan of Cussler's books since first reading ""Raise the Titanic"" in the 60s, but this one was painful to listen to.Some books are not meant to be on audio, and this was one of them. If I had to head about ""sapphire blue eyes"" or ""cornsilk hair"" one more time I thought I would scream...and the descriptions of women's clothing were ridiculous.The episodes in this book seemed to exist in isolation and have little to do with each other beyond the most tenuous connection. The editing was poor and the story itself was contrived and formulaic. The ending was pitiful.Cussler's books always have some kernel of reality in them, something that MIGHT happen if scientific research were to allow it. But the things in this book that were happening were just plain silly.....the oil filling (via some weird transference) an otherwise-empty briefcase once every few hours! AS IF !!!!I think it is time for Dirk Pitt to retire and try to keep some of his former dignity."
1,Disapointed,"I was disapointed by the lack of description of this book. I had expected a pocket size (A Format, possible B Format, what I received was a C Format. Had I known I would have ordered from someone else.I gave it away. Will not order from this seller again."
1,"Okay, I lied - I'd give it a negative five stars","This book reminds me of the movie ""Skyscraper"", starring Anna Nicole Smith ~ bad story, bad characters, bad dialogue, blah blah blah.... bad everything. Simply torturous. I mean, if we ever catch Usama Bin Laden, we should sentence him to read this book!"
1,Preposterous and poorly written,"This book was poorly wriiten, filled with cardboard characters, and unbelievable, (and this from a reader who loves fantasy and science fiction). Three examples:We are lead to believe that a consortium of CEO's of major oil companies collectively think that staging outlandish accidents including crashing an oil tanker into San Francisco and killing over 2000 peopke is an acceptable business plan for expanding profits. Only one member has second thoughts.When adrift in the ocean outside of shipping lanes, who arrives to save our hero? None other than the author in a catamaran. That's the best you can do Clive? Why not have him saved by space aliens?At the end of the book the long lost children that our hero didn't know existed appear at his doorstep after their mother dies. Does this have anything to do with the plot? It may link to prior books, but adds nothing to the plot line of this book other than a gratuitous ending.Overall, an embarassment to the genre."
1,Please Get Rid of Dirk Off,"Cussler has always had some interesting ideas for plots; too bad that the writing is just getting worse and worse. It goes beyond formulaic; it's just plain BAD. Too many parts of this book just made me cringe, and I can't believe that the author spent any more time writing this book than I did reading it. Maybe he just needed some bucks for a new car."
1,Deep-Six this one,"The beginning sequences of ancient norsemen and a 19th century mystery sub seemed interesting, and I was hoping they would tie together later. Unfortunately, the ideas were never really picked up again, and it seemed as if they were thrown in at the end of the book to ""tie"" everything together.Dirk Pitt (the superhero NUMA research engineer) has numerous poorly written escapes from death. He doesn't just get attacked by an old biplane while flying over NYC. He doesn't just get attacked by an old biplane while flying a planeload of children over NYC. He gets attacked by an old biplane while flying a planeload of disabled children over NYC. The story quickly degrades from here, if that is at all possible, into one about an Evil MegaOilCorp out to dominate the USA (and secretly paying off over 100 Congressmen&women/govt agents), as well as numerous ridiculous nautical-themed terrorist attacks.I payed $0.27 for the book at a thrift shop, and can plainly see why. Deep-six this one."
1,Rehashes the formula once too often!,"I've been a long time fan of the series, but this time the standard Dirk Pitt formula grated on me. When the young beautiful heroine was introduced I was like, ""Geez, Pitt is going to boink with her, or at least try to."" I bailed out of the book after that so I don't know if I was right or not, but I don't really care. Time to retire, Dirk!"
4,"Pitt stories are still fun, but...","This was one of the more enjoyable ""newer"" Pitt novels (I feel that starting with Dragon and after the books seem to be missing something...)I also just wanted echo some of the comments I have read in some of the other reviews of Valhalla Rising with respect to the formula of Cussler's books. You won't find anything new here...a meglomanic CEO as the villian, an outrageously evil plan to protect his market share from some kind world saving product (this time a new type of oil), a 30 something well educated love interest for Pitt and the Cussler cameo.Not sure if I like the new twist introduced at the end or not yet. Kind of a stretch...Did anyone notice the conversation about how the Titanic sunk in two pieces? I know the real world is different, but didn't Dirk and boys Raise the Titanic...in one piece?Still love these books though!"
2,Formula Novel Writing,"I have loved Clive Cussler since his first book back in the early 70's. However, his last few have not been up to the quality of his earlier work. I found the scenes in this book to be repititious of other scenes in his previous works. Plus, anyone who has read any of his previous material knows the descriptions of Dirk, Al, et. al. This to me just seemed to be filler to make the book longer.The editing was a bit shoddy also. Pacific Chimera's name was changed from one chapter to another."
2,Long time fan HUGELY DISAPPPOINTED,"Unlike some of my fellow reviewers, I am very disappointed in this latest Dirk Pitt novel. I felt like I was reading exerpts from previous books that had been strung together and re-titled. I have faithfully and happily read every book from the very first one and we need either a major injection of new ideas for the next plot or the series needs to stop. I cannot believe that Clive Cussler himself was not bored while writing this one because I was certainly bored while reading it!"
4,Awsome,Clive Cussler really write's a nice book... I don't usually read this type of book and I've read just about all of his books.. A+
1,"Terrible, I wanted to scream","Valhalla Rising is my first and last Cussler book. I stopped reading about halfway through and have not had any second thoughts. Based on reviews it only gets worse. Writing is cheesy, and predictable, not to mention sexist (e.g. ""She could dive just as good as any man""). And what kind of author writes themselves into their own book?! It was like a cut and paste action movie- from a burning boat, to an airplane chase through NYC, to a trapped submarine. Also, the mundane descriptive details about meaningless things (tell me again how the ropes are aligned on the boat) were just too much. No thanks, it was pure garbage."
1,"Bizarre, to say the least","Ok, you have got to be kidding me. I was plodding along, trying to enjoy the story and the plot, when all of a sudden in the end of chapter 16 (?) Dirk and his friends are rescued by someone named Clive Cussler?!?! No way! I have never read a book of fiction where the author creates a character called himself. Is this typical of best sellers? Did you ever see any of the great writers do this? Hemingway, Steinbeck? I'm going to put this one aside and try Fire Ice, but that's it. I'll probably never read another Cussler novel again. Give me Shaara any day. (And I even had one of Shaara's in my hands at the library, but decided against another Civil War book--too bad. I'm sure I'd still be reading that one.)"
3,Okay...this is different,"This was one of the first Dirk Pitt adventures I'd read, and I came across something I've only seen online in bad fanfiction: self-insertion. The author appears at the helm of a super-yacht to render aid to Dirk and his team towards the middle of the book. It's definitely odd, but the story is well-plotted and I'm growing to like Cussler's stable of characters including Pitt and Kurt Austin."
2,Shipwreck of a beach novel,"I picked this up on a shelf of a backpackers, and since I didn't have to pay for it I am feeling more charitably inclined towards it than many of the 1 star reviewers. It is a very cheesy novel which I found moderately enjoyable. It is pretty much required that you switch off any sense of reality to enjoy it (and this gets pretty damn hard when the author introduces himself into the story. One particular criticism is that he manages to convey no sense of place in the story, which takes you to Wellington New Zealand, the Kermadecs, Tonga, New York and Florida, but doesn't even remotely try and evoke any sense of what those places are like or how they may be any different to Washington. Oh, and he tries to do way too much in the story. The oil plot. The teleporting plot (teleporting!). The Viking plot. The Nemo plot. The threads that link there are tenuous indeed."
1,Now I remember why I stopped reading Clive Cussler,"How many times does Clive Cussler need to remind us of his love for his hero that should have died 10 books ago....""He was a tall man, three inches above six feet, and a lean 185 pounds. His every movement seemed consciously planned. The black hair was wavy, alomst shaggy with a touch of gray beginning to show at the temples. The face was a face that knew the sea above and below. The tanned skin and the craggy features revealed a love of the outdoors. He was obviously someone who spent far more time under sun and sky than under the fluorescent lights of an office.""The stories are interesting, the facts melded with fiction capture my interest, but the never ending cavity creating praise for Pitt and constant cliches will prevent me from picking up a Clive Cussler/Dirk Pitt novel again."
3,Interesting but slow,Interesting book. A lot of interesting information. Well researched. I have not read any other book by this author so I can't compare it.
5,DIRK PITT'S SWEET SIXTEEN,"As a mystery author with my debut novel in its initial release, I eagerly look forward to each new Dirk Pitt novel. Clive Cussler's sixteenth Pitt adventure, VALHALLA RISING, involves the sinking of the world's most celebrated new cruise ship. Dirk rescues the most of the passengers, but the inventor of the ship's revolutionary engines drowns. Our hero saves Dr. Egan's beautiful daughter Kelly, and soon Dirk and Al Giordino are attempting to foil a plot to corner the world's oil supply. By the way, Dirk also finds time to save Kelly from a second brush with death, discover the remains of an early submarine, and prove the Vikings landed on the Hudson. VALHALLA RISING is a fun read, though I used to buy my son the latest Cussler to read on cruise ships. I doubt if I will with this one. I'll let him read VALHALLA RISING on dry land."
4,A Delightful Romp,"Having read most of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt tales, purchasing Valhalla Rising was an act of loyalty, not anticipation. In recent years Cussler's characters were too flat and the plots were too outlandish for enjoyment. Valhalla Rising proved to be a wonderful page-turner and a delightful romp. The author concentrated on the heroe's character by drawing on inner thoughts and more charismatic dialog. Cussler developed two facinating sub-plots that keep the reader's interest long beyond Pitt's inevitable victory over the evil guys. Readers enjoy an unexpected surprise at the ending. One has to toast an author that escapes a tired, yet successful, formula and delivers an interesting and exciting evolution. Well done, Clive. Can't wait for the next edition!"
5,Come on people....,"Jesus Christ....what do you people want? I mean, really....when you walk into the book store and pick up a Cussler book, you know you're not buying Pulitzer Prize stuff....so give them man a break. If you want Shakespeare, buy Shakespeare."
2,Clusser must of lost his orginial story overboard.,"I love reading Clusser novels, but this one was a reach. I understood the imagination and ideas Clusser was orchestrating but the symphony was out of tune. Hopefully, this story doesn't tarnish 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea or the great Dirk Pitt stories of the past. Furthermore, did someone edit this story? I found it a dissappointment to read, between the misspelled words and the timeline of events, at the end of the story, that didn't seem to fit."
1,Valhalla Should Have Stayed Lost,"Picture this hypothetical conversation - ""Cussler, you promised me a book by August, it's July now, where is the draft?"" - ""Was that this August??"" - unfortunately, you get the idea.The latest Cussler throws together the same plot elements which have become overused by Cussler - antique car being chased, rescue of beautiful women, evil megalomaniacs, . The worst is that is that the mystery (as usual) is conveniently solved for Pitt by the troika of Cussler (who happens by at a convenient time), Yeager and Perlmutter. The Cussler appearance in the book used to be just a minor annoyance - you'll wish for those times again. Usually, you read a Cussler book and think ""I could see how that would happen"" - not this time. What's next, interstellar travel for Pitt which proves that aliens did land at Roswell?I have faithfully bought all of Cussler's books - this is the last one that I'll buy without reading first."
3,Pitt to the rescue,"Clive Cussler has once again written a fantastical fictional wonderland of watery adventures. He never fails to give his readers exciting situations that bring nautical lore to modern times. I enjoyed his newest novel, Valhalla Rising, but I found Dirk's incredible rescues a few too numerous in this book. His writing style was choppy, and I found that I was predicting rescues and characters before they happened. This novel is recommended reading for all Cussler fans, but Dirk has possibly lived eight of his nine lives already."
3,What genre is this?,"My first Clive Cussler read, ""Treasure"", was, some years back, an ""on the edge of your seat"" thriller. So, I expected the same from Valhalla Rising. For the first third of the book, it met all expectations...but it went downhill from there. Halfway through the book, I felt like I crossed over into science fiction. At several points, I felt as though the only way that Cussler could make the story to work was to introduce something completely impossible to ""rescue"" the plot. Plus, I grew tired of every female character being georgeous, and every boat being unlike any ever seen before. Still, if you are looking for something entertaining, it works."
3,Disappointing for Clive Cussler,"This is not Clive Cussler's best work. I think I enjoyed reading Night Probe better, now that was a good one. But this one had too many ""weird"" things coming together. Like, Jules Verne, the Vikings, the Cerberus plot to blow up Lower Manhattan, etc, etc....he should have stuck to two intermixed themes as he usually does (like ancient Atlantis plus the Neo Nazis in Atlantis Found). Also, the idea of a matter teleporter and Jules Verne's original submarine is a little silly. The characters were weak, Dirk Pitt didn't really come out as Dirk Pitt in this one and too much time was spent on the peripheral characters. It was a fairly decent read, I just think that Clive Cussler could have done sooo much better when he wrote this one."
2,Nothing new here,"I listened to this book on CD on a road trip to New England. It was good enough to keep me awake and fairly entertained. I've never read Cussler before but I do enjoy the genre. Valhalla Rising follows the action thriller formula too perfectly. There's nothing fresh.Furthermore, Cussler eludes to historic events and fictional tales and how they may tie in with the main storyline. I spent most of the time wondering how he would tie them in. I won't spoil it for you, but there really wasn't much a tie-in at all. That was disappointing. Furthermore after the climax, the book keeps going. I don't know why. I was beginning to think there was going to be more action, but no. Just a long ending.I have heard that Cussler's other books are quite good, so I will suggest not starting with this one."
3,Typical Cussler,"I have read literally ALL of Clive Cussler's novels. This one is exactly like the others -- pure mind candy.If you need a mind candy, Cussler always delivers. I hope he never quits."
5,Chillingly prophetic Dirk Pitt action thriller,"Clive Cussler is back in stride with Valhalla Rising. As is his style, an amazing confluence of historical events and the present merges to create a quick reading and engrossing novel with an almost believeable plot. Cussler shapes his hero Dirk Pitt as sort of a newfangled version of James Bond, a modern problem solving protagonist. He is opposed by Curtis Merlin Zale an industrial megalomaniac who is bent on contolling the worlds oil supplies. To accomplish this he plans an unbelieveably eerie attack on New York Harbor centered on the World Trade Center. As a native New Yorker this was terribly disparaging. Of course the plot is thwarted.Happily unlike many of the Dirk Pitt novels this one ends with an unexpected joyous twist for our hero.Valhalla Rising was a step up from Cussler's previous offering and makes me want to read anything written by Jules Verne."
1,The integrity of a once great series and character.....,"Just to qualify, what is about to be said. I have read all the books, I like the series less and less. The first were alive and fresh, an adventure. The new ones are...""Oh dear. I think someone was on autopilot writing this. 421 copies available from $0.01. Yep. The plot is too fantastical to even draw you in. The characters are wafer thin. An obsession with details, clothes worn, brands of gadget, etc. instead of eh story...In Sweden, we say 'cake on cake' - not one shipwreck, but 2, then a vintage plane fight over Manhattan, then finding lost viking boats, moored next to Cpt. Nemo's submarine. And an ending, to make you want to puke, it is so saccharin. No, no, no. All very disappointing. This is now the Mills & Boon of adventure. Or the Roger Moore of Bond."
5,Valhalla rose to the challenge!,"Another Clive Cussler success! Plenty of action, a little romance, and a lot of adventure! This one would have to rate along side Inca Gold, and Floodtide as my favorite Cussler novels. As per his successful formula, Dirk Pitt again gets himself into trouble by helping to save a damsel in distress, and he gets more than his money's worth, and so do we. I particularly enjoyed the aerial battle scene above New York City. He obviously wrote the novel pre-9/11.My only negative comment, is that you get the feeling he retired his major character(Dirk Pitt/Personna of Cussler himself) with this novel. Too bad, cause a lot of older guys, like myself really warmed up to Dirk, and Al, and loved reading of them getting themselves into, and out of perils. I look forward to reading his next novel Fire Ice, but will miss Dirk, and Al."
4,"Suspensful,Enjoyable, But Unsatisfying Climax","This book is for the most part very suspensful. However it has sleeper chapters mixed in which should either be rewritten or left out. Then, after reading 55 chapters , the reader is now ready to see the evil & monstous culprit, Zales, sentenced to a thousand hideous deaths or dragged 10 miles down the road by his tongue. Instead Clive allows him to escape by committing suicide. Very unsatisfying. Punish him unmercifully. Also after the climax Clive dribbles on for four more chapters about Jules Vernes submarine,& etc. which subjects are only slightly related & boring. However, in general , a great suspensful book.Loved it."
3,NOT Clive Cussler's usual standard,"I happen to love Clive Cussler and probably have read and own mostly every book he has written. I look forward to each new book and have found them all enjoyable and sometimes even special. This one did not live up to his usual standards. It read as if he wrote it in a hurry, and the ending, especially, was a cheap contrivance. Dirk was very shallowly portrayed in this book, contrary to the care that Cussler puts into his characterization in the other Dirk Pitt books. I was very disappointed in this book, and hope that Clive Cussler takes the time and trouble to write a better book on his next outing."
4,the bottom line,"Another grreat book by clive cussler.sets up the storyline and charachters very well,keeps you thinking throughout the whole book. Thanks for another great read."
3,Vahalia Rising,The discs were dirty and scratched. I had to wash almost all the discs & even then some where so bad that cleaning didn't help. The track had to be skipped.
2,Pretty standard Cussler -- but he's reaching,"When I buy the latest Cussler (as I always do), I expect something fun and enjoyable to read, if a bit formulaic. However, this book really started to try my patience. Every Dirk Pitt cliche is overdone in this one. (As for the end, well, Mr. Cussler, are you really planning to drag this out THAT long??) I'll keep reading the Dirk Pitt novels, but I certainly hope that Mr. Cussler injects some new creativity into the series. (And the ending of _Valhalla Rising_ is NOT what I had in mind.)"
4,Dirk Pitt in another solid adventure,"A strong effort by Cussler. The author needs to stop putting himself into his novels, in my opinion. He's a good enough writer to find a way to get Dirk and Al out of jams. This is, however, a real return to the strong story telling that got me started 15 years ago on Dirk Pitt. Great evil characters work their way into the story and I found myself hanging on to the end.Cussler uses a great descriptive style and allows himself a bit of flight of fancy, but brings home a wonderfully chilling finish to his novel again. I like that he doesn't feel the need to go over the top in describing the technology, but doesn't also treat the reader like a techno-dummy.I hope that Clive will keep Pitt going for many novels to come! If you like suspense and plot, this is great stuff. Cussler does it again."
2,Disappointing,"This last book by Cussler - who used to be one of my favorite authors for this kind of books - is unfortunately a mere shadow of Dirk Pitt's earlier adventures. Nothing new, and all too much following the usual formula..."
3,That's Entertainment,"One admits to enjoying Clive Cussler with some trepidation. His plots are, after all, wildly improbable; his main character impossibly heroic; and his inclusion of himself in passing as a minor character, simply maddening. But I never fail to read him! As with Tom Clancy I enjoy the earlier novels more, probably because each author seems to feel the need to top himself each time out. Despite my fussing, I enjoyed this outing. The rescue early on of passengers from a sabotaged cruise ship is fascinating--and stands in implicit contrast to the real life Titanic disaster of an earlier century. And, most intriguing of all, is the plot twist in the last several pages which seemingly leads on to a whole new, and I think promising, way to continue the series. I confess: I'm hooked."
4,Good Cussler-Good Narrator-Audio book,"My Wife and I were happy that there is finally a new narrator for the Audio Book. We have read all of Clive Cussler's books and also listened to a couple on tape. We did not care for the way Michael Pritchard read Cussler's previous works. He read in a monotone and all the characters sounded the same. We think Scott Brink did a respectable job, and we enjoyed this audio book. Over the years we have listened to many narrators of different books. While Scott Brink is not at the top, he is a great improvement over Michael Prichard and I hope he narrates the next book."
4,A Good Book But Not Cussler's Best Work,As with many or my fellow readers I agree that Valhalla Rising is not one of Cusslers's greatest novels. It was still a good read and I was glad I bought it. I did have the honor of meeting Cussler at a book signing and he is a remarkable man who was extremely entertaining. The good news is that a new film based on his book Sahara is being filemd!
3,"Good, not the best Cussler. Ideas are getting old.","I've been reading Cussler since Raise The Titanic. He's gone from fresh and original, to tarnished and long winded. When Cussler copied Hitchcock's walk-ons with little cameos of himself as a character in the books it was cute. The first time. The second time it was lane. Now it's just annoying, especially since it's no longer a cameo, but a minor character. If you read the book, you know the ending. WHY the briefcase? What was the point? It was really lame. Cussler is aging Dirk Pitt, and that's fine. But after he reminisced about his long lost, drowned in the underwater lab, girlfriend, you saw the final few pages coming a mile away. Predictable. Will I keep reading Cussler? Sure - even his bad books are better than many writer's good efforts."
2,Valhalla Over the Top,"This long-time Cussler fan was disappointed by the latest Dirk Pitt adventure. Although populated by the usual techno-wonders, beautiful/unobtainable women and outstanding adventures (both in the air and undersea), Mr. Cussler was sloppy with distracting and unecessary complications -- most notably, the rescued briefcase that mysteriously refills itself with oil -- which took this novel clear over the top. Watch for a clumsy introduction of new characters at the very end, which promise immortality for Dirk Pitt and possible yawns for Mr. Cussler's faithful readers."
2,rewriting cosmology,"No doubting the popularity of Clive and Dirk, judging by some 150 reviews here. I find this page turner enjoyable, if you don't have expectations of anything other than formula writing on a cartoon level.BUT one major, comical, error Clive makes appears in the first pages, where he describes a cavern being hollowed out twenty BILLION years ago.As the latest [2002] Hubble derived estimations of the age of the universe are 12-14 billion years, and the solar system is generally acknowledged to be less than five billion years old, this is rather a howler. Unless Clive knows something we don't."
1,Please save your money.,This really seems like comic book material stretched into a serious waste of time. Dirk saves the world too many times to to have such dull dialogue.The worst element for us was that we unfortunately bought it on cassette. Scott Brick is about the least able reader we have come across in over 100 audiobooks. I hope he has a day job!
1,What happened Clive?,"The early Clive Cussler/Dirk Pitt novels were fun and exciting. I enjoyed them. Valhalla Rising was BORING. Why does Clive Cussler have to become a character in his own book. He must have an ego the size of the Grand Canyon. This was the most disappointing Cussler novel to date. This book could be labelled ""SOS"". Same old stuff. It's as though he put a template over one of the older novels, added some new characters and changed the plot a little. I'm tired of Dirk Pitt. I'm tired of Clive Cussler. The back cover of the book shows Cussler with all the antique cars he owns. Who cares?"
2,Cussler Ageing,"I have to agree with John D. from Charlotte, NC USA. Cussler overplays his cameo role and produces a book of medium wow factor. Superheros need reenergising possibly with the intro of some fallability angle eventually overcome by may be a new character. I have read all of Cusslers books so may be I am tiring of the plot style but I shall probably read any new works but for the moment I hereby declare disatisfaction."
