3,The years are not kind,It is sad to see how Deborah Harry has aged in this film. It is really only for die hard Blondie collectors.
4,Music is great but keep the remote control in hand,"DVD rocks out of the starting blocks with two songs, then bogs down with call-in requests from gushing fans, interspersed with dialogue from the self-important and lame MC. Debbie and others gracious throughout the dopey interludes but pretty obvious by the end they were thinking, ""why did we agree to do this?"". Check out the look on the drummer's face as he takes a call, then throws the mike out of the picture! The good news is whoever set up the DVD must have realized also, so that when you hit the fast forward button, it skips almost to the next song. Music is very good, the interludes excrutiating if you watch them more than once."
1,Don't forget the super glue!,As instable as water so don't forget to get your super glue or expect it's paint job to be very good. Looks like this great miniature and turns out to be a mess. It's not total garbage don't get me wrong. Just flimsy at it's connection points and the paint job is inaccurate.
3,My cd review,"The cd is GreaT the only thing I wasn'T happy abouT is that it wasn'T in stocK and so it took so long to get and all the while I didn't know what was going on, I never got a message it was back ordered.............."
4,Great for an egg!,I use it all the time to make one egg. Once it's seasoned it never sticks. While cooking my egg I put another small cast iron pan upside down on top and my egg cooks perfectly. The egg comes out perfectly round and is great for putting in an English muffin with Canadian bacon and a slice of cheese. Yum!
3,Goofy little pan..,"Pros: Easily concealed, oddly strange, small..Cons: The raised stuff on the bottom makes this an impractical pan for real cooking.On the plus side it is very fun to hide at friends houses until they find it. Thus the pro's for easily concealed."
4,Jake's Angel,"New Mexico 1874, finds wounded Texas Ranger Jake Coulter dragging himself into a small western town. The only medical help is Isabel Bradshaw, a widow with two small boys, that the locals call ""a witch"" because of her healing powers. Jake, a widower, is determined not to let his attraction to Isabel keep him from finding the outlaw he has been tracking and taking back to justice. An enjoyable read!

1,could be better,"I bought this in august. By the third use, I had green water(ice melts). There was wood inside the bottom piece which got wet. I took the bottom piece out and threw it away. After a few more uses, the water started coming out the bottom by the wheels. I liked the handle and would love to keep using this, but it leaks. Maybe I can use it for dry goods only. Oh yeh, it needs a drainage system."
4,Realistic yet good,"I just finished reading this novel, and with the exception of some scenes not related running into each other(not often), I found it an enjoyable read. Sydney loved Anthony through desertion, yet she was rewarded for it in the end. Indira married true to form by marrying an abuser, yet in the end, she did well, and Maxine got with a guy who lied from day one but she didn't realize it due to the fact that she wanted it to work. Each of these ladies have faults and they work through them and still love each other. Enjoyable and realistic."
4,Incredibly entertaining,"This is an amazing live concert. Todd Park Mohr is unbelievable on guitar as well as vocals. Reminds me of another favorite musician, Mark Knopfler. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the video and audio are not in sync. Its off just enough to notice. I think its because the audio recording wasn't that good. Anyway, I highly recommend as a fan of BHTM. Peace"
5,A lot of fun to watch and listen to!,"I rarely if ever listen to live CD's or DVD's, but I've watched Live At The Fillmore multiple times and still enjoy it. These guys are absolutely amazing live. My wife and I catch their shows every chance we get. Every time we get a chance to play their music for friends most become ardent fans as well. I hope these guys are still kicking it when they hit retirement age. We'll still go see and listen to them. :-)"
5,Big Head Todd and the Monsters,"Anyone whom has seen BHTM perform Live knows the show will be a treat. Those that do not, keep your eyes peeled for the next opportunity to attend a performance near you. Visually, Todd Mohr is a performer/entertainer, his voice and especially his mastery of the stratacaster Guitar is awesome, and these are present aurally on this album, with some gritty added soul vocals from Ms. Miller. As Live albums go, the mixing adds some oomph to the overall experience. Well recorded."
4,Wide Backpack,"I searched high and low to figure which High Sierra backpack might work for my first grader. She needs to pack snow pants and boots in addition to all the other school gear, so I wanted a larger but still manageable backpack. Unfortunately, this was just too big. It was quite wide. In fact, I would have kept it for myself, but I found it to be too wide for comfort myself. It does appear to be nice quality and I like the large pockets and the clip on the outside."
3,Great print,"We picked this backpack for middle school because of the great print. Not many great girls prints out there. However, the multiple pockets did not create one big space big enough for the book load, soccer gear, etc. Hard to imagine that there could be too many separators. Also I found that my son's Dakine Lg Campus backpack was taller and could fit a lunch box nicely above books. So we ended up with a Dakine for men for my daughter because the Dakine girls backpacks are also on the small side. Wish we had the great print but function won out over style."
2,"Poor quality and design, great customer service","I've used this bag twice a week for school for the past 8 months, and every single one of the cloth zipper pulls have unraveled/shredded. The more the pulls unravel, the more they are caught in the zippers. So I've had to cut them all of them off. The seams of the backpack are also coming unraveled such that 2-inch-long threads are hanging loose at seams all over the bag. Now I'm on Amazon shopping for a better quality backpack.UPDATE: High Sierra has a 100% satisfaction guarantee for their products. The claim was very easy to file and quickly processed. While they don't offer refunds, they did replace the bag and send a $10 rebate for future purchases. While this new bag does not seem to be of significantly different quality than the old one, HS should be commended for great customer service."
2,Backpack Trouble,"I owned this backpack for approx. 7 months before the zipper lost one of the ""teeth"", had one of the zipper parts come off track, and had this zipper come away from the seem. I was using this backpack for school. Since I am still in high school I had 3-4 textbooks in it at a time carrying it from class to class. This backpack could probably handle the abuse it would get from a middle schooler carrying lighter loads and only to and from school, or a person taking it on a vacation trip packing lightly and only clothing and essentials."
5,great school bag,"My 14 year old daughter needed a strong school bag and also a tall one as some folders are quite big. This bag is perfect. It is strong and allows to put all she needs inside, plus the price is decent."
4,Good quality backpack,"My daughter uses this backpack for school and really likes it. It sits nicely on her back and looks very secure, It has several pockets, including one at the tip-top for an mp3 player with the necessary holes for your headphones to reach your ears, and it also has straps at the bottom for a blanket, flute case, etc...she doesn't use the straps and it's not obvious that they are there. Her only issue was that her large 2"" binders along with books are sometimes a bit snug...but I really can't see her using anything larger."
5,Backpack,Awsome backpack for the money.Granddaughter loved the plaid colors and design.Strapes padded and wide. Large area inside of bag for plenty of books and supplies
5,Bought for 4th grade daughter -,"Lot's of pockets. My daughter likes the straps on the sides that hold in your water bottle. Well made backpack, and looks good, too"
2,Please think it over before placing your order!,"This backpack is not in Zebra, black, as is described in the title. Besides black and white, there is also blue, yellow, green, orange on the edge of the black part, which make the backpack look dirty and messy."
5,High Sierra Loop Backpack,Great backpack. Small zip pockets on top are very useful. Very well built. Very comfortable to wear for long periods of time hiking or walking. No complaints. Would buy again.
4,Love the look. Lots of space.,I'm loving this backpack. It's comfortable on my shoulders and has plenty of space and compartments to fill up for an easy commute to work.
3,Average,"Pros- Tons of pockets and space- Zippers are large and smooth to operate- Nice color (mine is amazon/charcoal)- Comfortable shoulder straps- Light weightCons- I'm not sure the material is very durable. It has a ""papery"" feel and seems cheap. It's quite thin on the bottom and the sides.- The handle is integrated into the shoulder straps. It should have been left separate.- There are too many buckles & straps (for example, on the underside) which one might never use."
2,Material quality is bad,"I bought this bag looking at such good reviews and low price. After it arrived, I really disappointed looking poor material quality .It is very simple backpack ,not sturdy enough to carry 2-3 files and a laptop .So, I returned this item."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"Was excited to get this backpack in red at such a great price. Turned out not be to what I expected. I see that there are pics now that clearly show the back/straps. There weren't any when I bought it. The back felt and looked like the bottom of a tent and I knew the moment I saw it that it would heat up. (A big deal in Arizona where it's 104 in the shade.) Was expecting some breathability, like other High Sierra's I've seen. Guess you get what you pay for. And just to make it an all around pleasant shopping experience (sarcasm), Amazon charged me for the return. Apparently it's a new policy that if you don't like the item, you pay."
1,INACCURATE PICTURE OF BACKPACK,Not as pictured! I wanted the Backpack that is pictured on Amazon but unfortunately it is not an accurate picture of the backpack. I liked the strap around the waist and the velcro closed pocket on the strap that is pictured. What I received was NO WAIST STRAP AND A SMALL MESH POCKET THAT CAN NOT FIT MY CELL PHONE. VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MY PURCHASE BUT NEEDED THE BACKPACK FOR TOMORROWS TRIP.
5,Backpack,Nice for any teenaged girl. I have even borrowed it from my niece to use as my carry-on travel bag. The numerous pockets are very convenient for separating items and documents. I found the cellular phone pocket in the straps is convenient also for travelling as is the water bottle slot at the side and can be used as a laptop bag as well for travelling
2,Great backpack until it isn't,"Enjoyed the pack and found it well-built and designed for my needs. Enjoyed it, that is, for the three months I had it before it began to come apart at the seams. Like some other reviewers, mine came apart near the top by the straps; it wasn't just the seams but the cloth around them. It's repairable, but not easily. You get what you pay for, I guess."
2,not as big as listed,"very happy with the looks of this back pack. I needed one large enough to hold everything my 15 yr old daughter needs to carry to school, however the dimentions listed did not hold true . It was too small"
3,A nice gift to someone in transition,"This is a short, gentle, uplifting and simple book for anyone on the threshold of change, or going through life transitions"
4,Does the job,"My older cat Jetsum had a few issues with breath, which made him a lot less cuddly, so we brought this and spray it in his mouth once a day. It seems to be working slowly but surely. We didn't want to overwhelm him by spraying it more than once in his mouth and only once a day, but he is getting used to it and it works better every day."
5,a kid for two farthings,"we saw this movie 40 years ago and it is still a lovely, light, memorable experience."
4,In Living Color!,"Does anybody actually watch these films before reviewing them? One reviewer, basing comments on childhood memories, says this movie is in black and white. In fact, it's in wonderful color (using an old process that makes every scene look beautifully hand-tinted)! As for the movie, this is a sentimental tale of the very best kind, a story about caring and sharing and childhood innocence made by a first-rate director (Oscar-winner Carol Reed). It's a largely forgotten treasure that richly deserves its new life on DVD."
3,Not ba-a-a-ad for,"Joe (Jonathan Ashmore)is a six-year-old slum boy who believes in the magical power of unicorns. A perverse old man convinces Joe that if he could only come upon the legendary unicorn, he could grant all the wishes of his poor neighbors. Joe finds a unicorn, but it is a single-horned goat - will it have magical powers after all?This movie holds some magic for nostalgic fans and little kids, but the rest might want to save their farthings.Staci Layne Wilson"
4,well written & informative,"The author of THE HINDU VISION, Alistair Shearer, is most knowledgable on the subject. He thoroughly explains the symbolism of the art. He also provides a good background for the Hindu religion in general. This book has many photos as well, from statuary to temple shrines. I didn't give it 5 stars because I would have liked more color illus. of paintings & less photos of statues. It still gives a good variety of Hindu art to view, though. I highly recommend it."
1,terrible product,"I know I shouldn't have expected much from a $10 corkscrew....and my expectations were met. The flimsy plastic cover over the foil cutter broke as I took the product out of it's packaging. Within a week's use, the screw itself was bent, and the metal ""feet"" that rest on the lip of the bottle as you pry the cork were flared and bent, which made the feet slip off the lip. Finally, in week 2, the pivot arm broke out of the handle completely as I was trying to open a bottle. The opener fell apart after a half-dozen bottle. Don't waste your money!"
5,A great snapshot of the debate,"There are six views expressed by six authors: two that see the postmodern turn as a turn into apostasy, two that are neither for or against, and two that see the turn towards postmodernism as the salvation of the church. All are well written, and after reading a number of books on this subject, this seems to capture the true nature of the debate. Don't skip the Introduction, because Myron Penner gives a good overview or ""lay of the land"" including a brief (but good) description of postmodernism. Several of the authors represented have written full length books on the subject--but when you read their book you only get that one view. And the second half of the book is each writer's opportunity to respond to what others wrote in the first part. I especially think chapter three by Kevin J. Vanhoozer is an important attempt to value both perspectives."
2,Same as 5th Edition,Disappointing update. I already had the 5th edition and this was a nominal improvement at best
2,Extremely boring presentation of an interesting life...,This book is very thick and very difficult to read. I do not reccomend this biography because of how confusing it is to read. There are too many dates thrown in here and there and not enough simple facts to keep the reader focused. I have read many biographies but this one must surely rank as the most perplexing! Try another biography of this interesting woman.
2,Difficult to follow,"The subject was interesting to me but the author is not easy to read. Her sentence structure is often convoluted, I found myself having to reread many sentences to grasp the meaning. She also refers to people,dates and places in such a way that it is difficult to keep track of what is going on. Finally, her perspective is very sympathetic to MS, its obvious the author is a feminist."
3,An explanation of key words from the text.,"This only gives the explanation of key words from the text which helps understant the text better, but does not really give an insight into what the text is saying, it is merely a background filler. If you are looking for indepth depiction of what is being said, do not look here."
4,Great first CD! Distinctive and smooth... worth every penny!,"Great CD! Skyline Blvd's first disc has a very distinctive and clean sound... a good selection of tunes, some fast, some easy, all smooth! Sat_Mourn is a particularly great track, hard hitting without beating you up! :) I found myself listening to this disc all the way through *three times* on a recent short trip... usually repetitive tunes bore me to tears, but I kept putting this one back in! Love it! You don't find this kind of quality in the mainstream pre-packaged re-spun [junk] that today's labels put out... they charge twice the price for their ""hits"", and they don't even come close to Skyline Blvd's style or talent. This CD is definitely worth a try, especially at this price!"
5,Great product,"This item was exactly what we wanted to send as a gift.. It is great for multi use. Fast shipment, reasonably priced."
4,Good Product,"I needed a dutch oven for a new recipe that I was trying, but didn't want to pay $100+ for one. I found this one on Amazon and thought I'd try it since the price was right. It worked great and is supposed to last 100 years. I joke with my family that we now have a family heirloom. I recommend this as a basic dutch oven."
2,Disappointed,"Although a good idea, the skillet top on the 5 quart Dutch Oven makes it awkward and a bit unstable when lifting in addition to it being unsafe when hot. The top is not easy to remove and this was all found before it was used. I am somewhat uneasy thinking of how I would remove the top following oven use. It is being returned for a model with a knob type ""handle"" on the lid."
1,Crap?,"So my mom and I used this pot for the first time and it was to carmelize a few onions and garlic with oil, nothing big. Then we washed it like we do with all the other pots, soap and water with a sponge, no scrubbing was necessary as we didn't do anything too big with it. So, the pot has now dried, we want to put it away and what do we see has happened to the pot, a questionable (maybe rust) brown color has coated the inside of the pot. We don't know what the problem is and don't want to use it because we don't know what this brown stuff is. A complete waste of money."
2,"Ok, but sorry I bought it","It cooks OK, but not worth the trouble and upkeep. Other pots that are easier to maintain, cook as well. Sorry I wasted my money."
5,Product was very good - Amazon was not so good.,The Lodge Dutch Oven was very good as I knew it would be.My experience with Amazon was very disappointing. There was an error during the ordering process and I had to submit the order again. I ended up with two Dutch Ovens ordered.Within five minutes of placing the order I tried to cancel one of the orders and Amazon said it was too late. I ended up with two Lodge Dutch Ovens. The error was not my fault but a problem on the Amazon site.
5,Perfect Size,"Exactly as advertised. Great price and shipped free. Arrived early, and packaged well. I wanted a new dutch oven, and liked the fact that this one, has a cover that also serves as a skillet. I love the Lodge cast iron line."
3,Okay,I wasn't crazy about the lid. I never used it. I ended up sending it back and getting the Lodge 5.5 quart with the traditional lid and a separate cast iron frying pan.
5,Dutch oven,Live this Dutch oven. Is exactly as described. Bought it to cook homemade bread in. Recipe called for this pan and is a good choice. I can find anything I need on Amazon!
4,Double Dutch Oven,"I like this set. The skillet cover works very nicely as a skillet and the Dutch Oven does everything it is supposed to. It arrived quickly and in great condition. I like the iron because it cooks well, browns and caramelizes beautifully, and cleans up quickly. It arrives already seasoned and it really is. It just needs to be taken care of properly. I am glad I bought it."
2,Chipped and missing coating in numerous areas.,I received this item a few days ago. After opening the box I noticed the coating on the Pot and Pan was chipped or missing in several areas. Due to the fact it came late Friday I had to wait until Monday to contact Lodge Logic to ask them what to do. The customer service representative I spoke to informed me that the coating being chipped all over doesnt make a difference and it will be fine to use. if that is the case then why is it coated?
5,Lodge Logic,"The price of the product was extremely reasonable, I recieved the product in a timely manner, and I am completely satisfied with my choice in product."
2,Food tastes funny & rust - Wouldn't buy again,"We've used this for 6 months now and wouldn't buy it again. If you cook a soup and liquid condenses on the top, you need to make sure it doesn't sit too long or or it will rust. Then when you open the lid all that rust drips into your stock/soup and leaves a bad taste and discoloration. Also without a knob on top of the lid you need two hands to open it up which makes quick stirs annoying as you have to set the lid down somewhere else. After you wash it you need to wipe on some oil to prevent oxidation but that wasn't too bad, just an extra step when cleaning. We're going to replace it with an enamel coated pot today which is what we had before this one."
4,A nice little oven,"I like this dutch oven! Ours arrived in perfect shape (and with free shipping!). My only advice would be to order a lid with a handle. The skillet cover is a bit hard to manipulate, so I ordered the lid soon after using this pot a couple of times."
5,Great deep fryer,"I bought this item for the sole purpose of deep frying. I used to have a 8"" pot, although deep, it would barely fit two pieces of chicken side-by-side. This dutch oven is perfect, I can fit three pieces of chicken with enough room between them. The heavy lid creates pressure inside the pot, essentially deep fry and pressure cook at the same time, which cooks the meat next to the bone without burning the skin or drying out the chicken."
4,Heavy Cast Iron,I love this pot set. The cover is just great as well.I was a little concerned about being able to open and close the pot but all I have to do is place the cover on with out alining it with the handles on the other skillet cover.Cast Iron also makes the food taste better !
5,Great Product,Can't beat Lodge. Already seasoned-and it works. Another great feature is the lid which can be used as a saute/fry pan.(<:). Fast shipping and good price.
5,A must-have for one-pan dinners,"My wife and I are working parents of two. Recently - and for varied reasons - we decided to 1) cook more from scratch, and 2) abandon non-stick (Teflon) pans. We also dropped red meat. And, I do all the cooking.We were already using stainless for sauce pans and larger pots, but non-stick skillets. So, we needed some cast iron skillets and a Dutch oven.The Dutch oven is by far my favorite. You can throw anything in it (whole chickens, frozen veggies, rice, pasta, casseroles, etc) and it will cook it beautifully.My favorite is a ""whole"", organic chicken from Trader Joe's. In two hours, (350*F) you will have the best chicken you have ever tasted. I use olive oil, some garlic, whatever veggies I can find, and (no salt) seasoning.We have never eaten better, healthier food.And, clean-up is a breeze. I scrub it with stainless wool (NO SOAP) and ten seconds later it is done."
4,Lodge Logic 5-Quart Double Dutch Oven and Casserole with Skillet Cover,"What bothers me that this product keeps rusting. I'm still hoping that at some point rusting should stop. I had cast iron dishes before, and they never rusted."
5,Lodge Products are and excellent gift!,"I have never been disappointed by any Lodge product. The fact that it's made in the U.S.A., which was a priority for my purchases this year, put it high on my gifting list."
4,Upside-Down Dutch Oven.,"Bought this to mimic a steam oven for making sourdough bread in a standard fan oven...Works like a dream...Excellent.Pity that this is not available on the British Amazon site., anyway the postage was worth it!"
5,best ever,BOught this for my husband ...he wanted something that can start on the stove and end up in the oven. This met all the criteria...as an added bonus the top can be flipped over and become a skillet...especially handy when the pot comes out of the oven piping hot...we flip the lid over and saute spinach as a side dish without having to wait for the pan to heat up. ALso good for making stew when browning all the meat....put half in the pot half in the lid when its done browning you just flip the lid over into the pot ....saves time and energy.
5,Love Cast Iron,"I love my cast iron. I even went to one of the Lodge stores and oooed and awwed. I cook in it all the time. You get double for you money on this one. I had purchased several and can mix match lids.If I had to order more I would, but I don't need anything. Lodge is a great product."
4,Great product for the price.,"This would definitely have recieved 5 stars if not for the factory coating most likely made from genetically modified soybean oil. Make sure to un-season by placing in a self-cleaning oven or hot fireplace, then re-season with some high quality organic oils. For seasoning we like to use coconut or grapeseed oil. I bake artisan breads in this, boil soups, saute on the ""lid""... This is a great cast iron piece and I highly recommend it to cast iron novices and experts alike."
5,You need this for your kitchen,"I recently bought this set & have already used it 4 times. Roasted a chicken, made a mountain man breakfast, tomato soup, & asparagus. It's done an amazing job on all of them. Plus it's super easy to clean up."
4,Necessary for Frontier with Ultitrack & bed extender but beware,"The extender kit is needed on the Nissan Frontier with Utilitrack and bed extender. It does not install easily, and it took several hours by my dealer to get the cover on. The problem appears to be with the instructions for the kit. The bed extender central tubes did not slide when the brackets holding them were loosened. They were frozen, and I and the dealer service people couldn't unfreeze them to shorten by 4"" as indicated in the instructions. It could be a new design feature involved. The dealer ultimately called for additional info on the extender. Apparently, there are (at least on new? models) inner tubes that give additional support. The external tubes do not slide. They had to cut the tubes by 2"" on each side. Once this was done, the extender kit works as described."
5,Paperweight,"It was just what I wanted! Real shells that can be rearranged in the sand. I did order another one from a different company and it was okay, but a picture of sea shells. This one is MUCH better and just as I pictured it."
5,Did what I needed done,"I chose Bushwacker bed rail caps because they extended further down the sides of the bed than other brands I looked at. I had a small dent in the bed close to the top rail and these caps covered it up nicely. That saved me a few hundred dollars in body repair and I like that! They went on easily with the double stick tape already applied on the underside and have two spring clips with screws on each cap to insure that they don't come off. My wife and I installed them in about twenty minutes, including the pre-cleaning with alcohol. They look good and I'm very happy with them."
2,JUMPER ENDS UP A ...DUMPER!,"OK, OK, I know this is just another preposterous action sci-fi film, but for such an interesting premise to end up going nowhere, I have to say, don't waste your money and watch this on cable. The film is fast paced, but for a film that clocks in at under an hour and a half, it felt very long. This might have played better as a TV episode of some random sci-fi series.The film does say a lot about our society though as with such an amazing and powerful gift, all these lunkheads could think to do is rob banks and steal cars...etc! It's pure fantasy and that's OK by me, but make it a little more interesting next time. The film may appeal to some, but for anyone who wants a little more out of their sci-fi movies, this one's a dud! Even Lane and Jackson can't save this one!"
2,Waste of time,"I saw this movie last night and the thinness of the plot amazes me. The acting was mediocre at best. Samuel L Jackson is a man on mission that he fails to explain sufficiently. Diane Lane shows up sparingly like this is a cameo.The only good thing I can think about in the whole movie is all the locations that they go around the world ""jumping""."
4,Jumper,"A decent Sci-Fi.It is worth an evening of your time.Suspenseful.I'll give the acting a C+I just wish Hollywood would quit misusing the Lord's Name.There is no need for it,doing so diminishes the quality of a movie.There is one scene of a blatant violent killing ,which I found to be totally unnecessary.I wouldn't recommend it for a family viewing because of this.Very little swearing though.I was disappointed with the ending.Rather an abrupt ending that left no closure with several questions unanswered.Special effects was slightly above average.A good watch but definitely not a favorite Sci-Fi of mine."
1,Special Effects didn't save it,"I have three good word of advice: READ THE BOOKThe book was written in 1992, I first read it in 1994. Since then I have re-read this book several times. The book is rich with story, emotion and the details to breath life into the characters.I really used to hope that someday this story could be turned into a movie. Now I just wish they would re-title this movie because, unfortunatly, it is such a weak distortion of the book.Please don't waste your time with the movie, just read the book."
1,awful,"this is a movie that could have been really good but it wasn't. it was AWFUL. hayden christiansen is good at playing unlikable characters but you would think this is one movie where you would want to root for the anti-hero. the premise is intriguing, the story is weak and full of holes leaving one very dissatisfied at the movie's conclusion"
1,"oh my, what a yawn!",They took a great premise and made a sleeper out of it....I couldn't have been more disappointed. Dopey acting in a teeny bopper snooze flick.
2,All that Potential and Still a Subpar Movie,"***mild spoiler***I wanted to like Jumper, I really did, but something about it just made me shrug and think (that was a very long hr and a half). The action scenes have little bits of eye candy, but the plot's fairly terrible and the dialogue is instantly forgettable. I saw the movie all of one night ago and really the only line I can remember is something near the end where he seeks out his mother.The main characters, David Rice and Mille, are off globe trotting after a brief barroom fight. That I can buy, or at least shrug off, but it seemed that the actor and actress had very little onscreen chemistry.Nothing about the movie really, really annoyed me, which is why I give it a 2 star review, but nothing impressed me either."
4,Family movie night,Purchased the rental HD for family movie night. Great alternative if you find you never make it back to Redbox the very next day.
3,Must for Jamie Bell fans...,I adore Jamie Bell & he is awesome in this movie. The storyline is great fun not the best but not the worst.
5,Fantastic Video and Audio,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.It has been a while since I saw this movie, but here is what I remember. The video quality of this Blu-Ray is outstanding. The audio quality is about the best I have ever heard. Lot's of sound coming from all the speakers, including the sub-woofers."
3,"Fun movie, a little thin","I just saw this movie, coincidentally with a similar, newer one called ""The Speed of Thought"". Liked them both. This movie was bigger and had better effects, but the other movie had a lot more heart and soul, and was more unusual. Oh, and had better acting. Hayden Christensen is kinda lame. Sorry, Hayden. On the other hand, Jamie Bell is great. And I loved that song at the end, ""Blackened Blue Eyes"". Funny how the right song at the end of the movie can make you feel better about the movie..."
3,"Not bad, but very predictable","This isn't a bad movie, but the entire thing was very predictable - you feel like if the trailer were a bit longer, you'd have watched the movie."
3,Middle Of The Road Fun,"I liked the premise of this movie, which features an unpopular teenager with a bad home life whom discovers that he has the special ability to teleport wherever he wants to go. We see how he learns to use this special ability to make a new life for himself. We learn his unique talent brings along unexpected consequences.The overall storyline of this movie is good, but could have used more overall depth to it then the superficial glossing over of certain topics. The special effects are decent enough. I also think the characters should have been developed a bit more along with the storyline to make this film a lot better as a whole."
3,This movie is ok.,"There is allot of people in here that have obviously not see any of Hayden's other movies. Maybe you should do that before leaving senseless comments. True this is not a movie where the acting needs to be ""out of this world"" but he still does a good job. I think that Rachel Bilson although cute as a button cannot act at all. She is weak and not a very strong personality in this movie. I cannot believe that this is the same director for Mr & Mrs Smith and the Bourne Identity. We are talking about two very good movies and this one is just okay! I guess I expected and wanted a little bit more out of what could have been a ""classic""."
3,Suspenseful,"Although I didn't care for this movie, my niece loved it and wanted it as a birthday gift. She likes Hayden Christensen and suspenseful movies, so this was a perfect selection for her. The movie had action and lots of teleportation, but highly believable, it is not."
4,Why did this movie get such bad reviews?,"The movie had great special effects, an interesting enough story and takes you all over the world to fabulous locations. It doesn't explain everything but I think the makers were planning to do that in sequels if there are any. I thought Sam Jackson's character was a bit on the corny side but I had a great time watching this movie. Well worth the rental."
2,"cool idea, terrible script","This says it all; while the main idea is excellent, there is no explanation - only running around on steroids. Cheap, cliche-y narrative tricks, obviously the producer took the path of least resistance.And the main actor gets on my nerves, he looks as whiney as he did in Star Wars."
2,First (and Last) Movie Based on the Hit Books,"After reading Stephen King's thumbs-up review of this film, I thought I would take a chance--even though critics panned it. I really hope that King saw a different cut of the film than the one released in theaters, because ""Jumper"" is a mess. It feels like the set-up for a movie or television series, rather than an actual movie in its own right. It introduces ideas, characters, and its own mythology, and just when things are beginning to take off...it ends. It could be a cool pilot for a tv show, but that's not enough of a reason to recommend it as a feature film."
5,Great movie,"I think I've watched this movie about 25 times. Its a very pleasant movie filled with action and suspense. Something that you can enjoy without feeling frustrated at the end. I like it, I think you will too."
3,It's okay,Although the action and the F/X are very good and I liked most of the perfomances. I found that the story was lacking.
5,Awesome,"Great movie, action packed good story line and lessons to be learned, worth the money and time, no need to think twice"
3,Pretty Fun Movie but not spectacular,"Pretty fun movie.Special Effects - 7 out of 10 (fun - fun - fun)Casting/Acting - 5 out of 10 (the casting and acting was so-so but, still ok)Plot - 3 out of 10 (a little simple but, still fun)Overall, definitely worth seeing. Especially if you're renting."
3,Jumper...the ups and downs.,"Being a huge Star Wars fan, I decided to see Anakin and Mace aka Hayden and Samuel in a new sci fi movie. The terrible reviews this film received prior to it's release didn't dissuade me in the least because everyone has different opinions. I found Jumper to be well made, with excellent visual effects and great worldly locations. The actors looked good and did well with what they were given. It's insane action sequences are followed by some slower 'talky' moments, that move the film along through to it's short end, with what looks like a sequel set-up. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel that touches on some backstory of the 'jumpers' and 'paladins'. If you want to see a boring critics darling, good for you, but, if like me, you like thrilling action, neat stunts and fast paced sci-fi thrillers, this is your ticket."
1,"Great book, terrible movie!","I'll warn you now, if you have read the book & enjoyed it avoid this movie at all costs, it will only make you angry.The only thing Doug Liman (the director), used from the book was the two lead characters names & the ability to teleport. 95 % of everything else is brand new and not for the better, they might as well have ran a disclaimer at the beginning of the movie stating ""this movie is geared for 12 year olds"". It will be hard to read the book again & enjoy it as much as I used to."
2,Poor movie,The idea of this movie is interesting but the story was bored you can easily expect what is going to happen next. I wish some other director films this with different story.
4,"Looks good in HD, decent movie.","Jumper is a fun action movie. I was expecting a little more science/magic explination of the ""jumps"" but the story didn't really develop that portion. As far as a good looking HD experience and some fun action scenes, this movie has them. I gave it a 4/5 because I think the story could have been better."
5,Jumper,What an awesome movie! A great sci-fi that generates energy from the very beginning to the end. Overall this is a enjoyable movie.
2,"Watchable, but deeply flawed","I can see why this got crap reviews when it came out, it was mildly entertaining but was filled with SO many plot holes and unanswered questions. It's like they came up with this really cool concept for a story and couldn't be bothered filling in the gaps. The Jumpers ""jump"" all over the place and NO ONE seems to notice, even though they teleport in the middle of huge crowds. They are always teleporting OTHER random innocent bystanders to other parts of the world with ZERO consequences and we knew NOTHING about Samuel L. Jacksons character in this!......why was he hunting the Jumpers? what's his back story? so many annoying unanswered things!The rest of the cast were HUGELY under developed as well, especially Rachel Bilson, who had more to do in the O.C than she did in this. The only real highlight was that guy from Billy Elliott [forgot his name], and Hayden Christianson looked good in it............everything else was a fast paced, empty mess."
2,"Great concept, weak execution","2.5 starsSuch a good idea, such a lame movie.Starts pretty well and just gets weaker by the minute. Christensen is simply boring (here and everywhere else I've seen him). He thinks looking seriously and quietly at someone is acting. I feel nothing when I watch this clown.Jackson is becoming a reliable sign of a cheesy flick.The effects here are good, but the plot and story are lazy and should be so much more ingenious considering the basic premise. So much to work with and so little accomplished.Not really worth watching."
2,PS3 trouble anyone?,"I recently rented this movie, its funny however I heard so many people talking badly about this movie I just had to see it for myself. I rented it today and put it in my my PS3 60GB first release and made sure the software is up to date and all but it won't play its seen as a data disc with an unreadable format. was curious to see if anyone has ran into this problem as well or if anyone might know of a fix for this. Thank you"
1,Never received the movie I ordered,"I order and paid for the movie, I never got the movie. I did contact the seller, who said he sent out another movie,that I never got either. I then recontacted the seller who said he was going to give me my money back. I'm still waiting for my money back."
5,Entertaining trip to far away places,"Having witnessed human teleportation first hand once while walking around a lake near my house, I therefore liked this movie a lot. Those super powers were cool, and I know that this movie is indeed factually based upon real things since I have experienced them myself. Kudos to the writers/producers for revealing this stuff to the general public at large, man. I couldn't understand half the things spoken by Griffin (Jamie Bell) but the action made up for this small problem. Diane Lane looked kinda old, man. Other than that, it was a great trip man. I was on the edge of my seat inside my man cave while I watched. I thanked God several times during the movie for such a wonderfully done film. Thanks God! (Spoken while pointing both index fingers toward the Heavens!)"
4,Good movie,Good adventure flick for all ages and fun for everyone. The price is good for a Blu rayNow a days
3,Enjoyable Movie,Bought this on a whim because I figured it would look great on Blu-ray. I liked what the director had done in the past (Bourne Identity)and was not disappointed! Not going to say it is the greatest movie ever but it is a great addition to a blu-ray collection
3,"Effects, yes. Acting..... er..... ummm...",Light action movie featuring exotic locations and interesting modes of transportation seeks unsophisticated audience willing to overlook significant flaws such as acting and plot.Kids OK.
3,Jumper,"this movie I looked forward to comming out onto video and I was not disapointed. The director hit a home run they waqs alot of action non stop. good suspence,good actors. It was futuristic, with alot of on your edge moments.I loved David Rice and Samuel L.Jackson."
5,Great purchase,"The movie was great. It was action packed, and surprised me many times. The purchase was easy and it arrived promptly and as advertised."
4,Watch it,"I've become addicted to reading fan reviews before I see any movie. This movie had such bad reviews from fans (averaging to about 3 stars)that I didn't see it until lastnight. PLEASE WATCH THIS. I don't understand why so many people had problems with the movie because I thought it succeeded on every level; the directing was awesome, acting/actors very good, locations were amazing and the script was very well written for an action movie (usually action movies succeed in the visual arena with explosions, special effects etc. but fail in dialogue and character development. This one managed to succeed in both.) People complained because there was either too much character development/ dialogue or as one person put it 'talking points,' or that there wasn't enough of a back story. I think its obvious that the second will continue into the backstory as to the 'whys' and 'whos' of the movie. Please watch it yourself and then post your own review."
5,Jumper Great Movie and Ahead of its time,"This is a Phenominal Movie that will keep you interested, it is action packed great special effects and eaven a little bit of a love story to it. Very Great and is eaven a family film but there is violence so use your discression."
4,Jumper is visually exciting and has a story to tell,"If you have read any of the books, let me assure you that while the story line and character names are similar, the story in the movie is different from the books. The views of the colosseum are stunning and also the setting in Egypt. The story moves quickly, the villains are hard to identify: are they the jumpers that steal and cause mayhem, or is it the paladins that trap and the stab the jumpers to death? Will our jumper who we have come to know escape? If so, how does he do it? What happens to the paladins who are after him? JUMPER will show you some of the answers, but leaves open the possibility of a rematch between some of the jumpers and the paladins who remain."
3,Good action flick,"This could have been a much ""richer"" film with more focus on character development, the morality of what Jumpers can do, how it affects those who know them, and an examination of ""normal"" complications interacting with non-Jumpers. While I understand the insertion of the Paladins as adversaries to generate conflict, I don't think they were necessary to create an interesting story. But...that was not the tale the makers chose to tell.So, given the parameters of a ""cool"" idea and an emphasis on action, this movie accomplished its (fairly) limited goals. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, the characters were reasonably likable (despite the one-dimensionality of Jackson's character...), and it was well made. Not an award-winner, but one that kept my interest."
3,Good plot,"I enjoy sci/fi movies. The plot of this movie was basically good, but there is something missing. I would say its a good one to rent, but save your money for one worth buying."
3,I Had To Give Some Thought to How I Would Review This,"All in all I liked this movie, but something about it has bothered me since I saw it. I just couldn't figure out what. Now I know. There is nearly no story line!!1. All of a sudden this boy became a ""jumper"".2. All of a sudden he encounters another ""jumper"".3. All of a sudden he and this other ""jumper"" are being chased by someone.4. And all of a sudden it's supposedly over....That's pretty much it. Theres no history of where the ""jumpers"" come from or how they evolved. Supposedly this is a thousand years long war, but how or why is it a secret? Where did the Paladins come from? His mother knows what he is and just leaves without telling him how to protect himself? Basically, I can sit and watch this without thinking and give it a 5, but when my intellect steps in and things stop making sense I can only give it a 3."
2,Jump Around,"Jumper could have been so much better, had the film been a bit longer. I felt that, no pun intended, the movie jumped around too much. The premise of teleportation is quite fun, and there are several action sequences in the movie, particularly the one in the Coliseum, that play out nicely. However, I felt with an extra thirty minutes or so, character development could have been built up, and the movie would have flowed better. Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson aren't going to be winning any awards soon, and their characters definitely lacked chemistry. This movie is good, brainless fun, but just feels really rushed and sloppily executed. I'm hoping the sequel will be more polished and put-together. I'd say rent it, don't buy it."
2,RAYDEN CRISTENSEN AND THE GIRL FROM O.C . RUINED IT,"I liked the book , and i do not understand what went wrongh with JUMPER , unlike the book the story is "" empty"" i did not care less about any of the characters * except the british guy * such a waste of potential , rayden cristensen is a terrible actor and coupling with that girl from the O.C. UAU ....... get's even worst . I do not recomend jumper for anyone especially the ones who read the book."
3,"Okay, but one of those view once movies","I didn't go for the plot too much on this show, so it's not a thriller I'd watch time and again. I'd watch it once, but probably not buy it like I did."
4,"Exciting, New Concept","it's a good movie, worth watching at least once.. Will keep you excited, plus it includes well known actors/actresses.Great visual effects, seems realistic, and somehow makes you want to visit the places in the movie."
1,How Did This Ever Get Produced?,Second only to Cloverfield in the list of movies I officially wish I had never wasted my time on. Hayden Christiansen may be this generation's Keanu Reeves. That is not a compliment.
2,I blame George Lucas!,"Watching Hayden Christensen ""act"" in Jumper is like repeatedly stabbing yourself in the eye with a #4 pencil.The film itself was decidedly 2.5 star-ish - nice looking special effects, a story that could have been a lot better than it actually was, and a phoned-in performance by Samuel Jackson that, unfortunately, seems to be the norm for him these days.Nothing, however, can prepare you for the agony that Mr. Christensen's thespian abilities will cause you - I mean, people say that Keanu Reeves is bad, but Keanu is a regular Kenneth Branagh (or Emma Thompson, if you prefer) compared to the atrocity that is Hayden Christensen. He was awful in the Star Wars movies, and yet ... here he is even worse.So, thank you, George Lucas - thank you very much for unleashing this beast upon an unsuspecting world. I mean, wasn't Jar Jar Binks enough?"
3,Stolen Theme,"There are a couple of other reviewers who've made it sound as if this movie, and the book, are creating a new idea here. This is far from the TRUTH!!!The greatest teleportation story ever written was authored by Alfred Bester (still only a book - nowwwww, that would be a movie!!!), and it was called, ""The Stars my Destination"".The first teleportation story ever written was a short story called ""Dangerous Dimension"" by L. Ron Hubbard authored in the 40's. Both ""Dangerous"" and ""Stars"" earn the hallowed mantle of ""CLASSIC"", and I will be terribly disappointed if the both of them don't make it to the Silver Screen sometime in the near future. ""Stars"" could actually be made into a trilogy. It is that good, and I recommend everyone read both books.They are . . . awesomely . . . classic.Ian Shillington N.D."
1,read the book,"I loved the book, hated the movie. When I first read the book I thought this would be a great movie. Finally they made the movie, I saw it opening night and all I could think was, God did they blow it! My date had not read the book so I loaned it to him afterwards and he to said it was a great opportunity lost.The movie plot was almost non-existant, what there was made no sense. The book went deeper into the lonliness of being the only jumper, had more suspense and background. It had Davy actually using his power for a good reason. I could go on but lets just say READ THE BOOK! forget the movie.Spoiler alert(movie only)Question:How did Davys mom go from being a lower middle class housewife to a paladin living in a million dollar mansion?"
3,It was okay,"I read the original Jumper series by Stephen Gould, the second part being Reflex, then Griffins Story. I have to say they butchered the movie. They definitely should not of cast Hayden Christensen, he is such a bad actor. They should of stuck with the younger kid at the start of the movie. David Rice in the book was a lot younger. They added the whole Paladin story which was none existent in the book also. I know movies never stick the the same plot as the book, but i just thought it could of been way better than it was. Don't get me wrong i still enjoyed it as a sci-fi flick.The best thing in the movie for me was when they introduced Griffin, the kid from England. He made the movie for me. He brought some excitement to it. Soon as Hayden Christensen's appearance came in, the movie went boring."
1,Who wrote this?,"What a great idea for a film but the story did not just fall through it fell all the way to China. Watching this movie made you want to go see the dentist as that would be a better story with a good ending.If you have two hours to kill watch the Muppets in Space, it was better Sci-fi then this."
1,formulaic and dull,This one doesn't rate a long review. I only watched it because it was one of the offerings on a long flight to South Africa. Vapid.Ron Braithwaite
1,Not sure what happened on this order,"JUMPER: I ordered this, Amazon has my credit card number. The listing showed it was in stock. I got a confirmation and it still said it was in stock and would be sent. Next thing I know, I got my money back, stating that it was out of stock. This was for a birthday present for my son, and I was disappointed that the listing and confirmation led me to believe I would get it. At least I got my money back OK. It would be be more beneficial if the listing might have said ""could be in stock or not"" and then I would be the one taking my chances. Thanks."
1,I didn't get what I ordered.,I ordered the Jumper Two Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy and I received the regular one disc edition with no digital copy. It would have been nice to know they weren't sending what was pictured or what I ordered.
1,UNWORTHY WATCH!,"I am not going to make a big review on this, but come on. This has to be the worst film I've seen lately, I place this with ""Be Kind Rewind"" a very stupid and unpleasing movie!"
4,Holly cow...,That was great and fast that the CD got here. It just amazes me how efficient all of you are.
4,Liked the movie thought the ending was a bit abrupt,"Enjoyed the movie, but it seemed like just when you were realy getting into it the movie just ended. I would still recommend it the premise of the movie was very good."
1,Sucks,This movie looks good but it was not as exciting as it looks on pre-views. Would not recommend anyone to buy it!
4,I liked it,"The only bad thing I have to say about this movie was the 10 sec boring and monotone ""acting"" of Kristen Stewart at the end of the movie .. Other than that the movie was very good,"
4,pleasantly surprised,"I must say, after reading some reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie. But I liked it. I agree that it could have used a bit more backstory to explain the origin of Jumpers but even without a lengthy explanation the movie was easy to follow. As for actors, I thought Hayden was great. Easy to watch and believable in the part and I think he and Rachel Bilson have a nice, unforced chemistry. Jamie Bell was great too. If they ever do make a sequel, I'll have it on my watch list."
1,Terrible smell,"I'm sure the product is good, but it has a very powerful odor that is way over the top. I deposited mine in the trash after one use."
5,Canon ACK-DCA20 AC Kit,The unit works perfectly and is easy to use. I highly recommend this unit particularly for anyone who transfers images directly from their PowerShot G7 or Digital Rebel XT/STi camera to a computer since it avoids having to drain the camera battery during this time
5,a must have,"if you're using your Powershot in the studio, indoor macro or time-lapse sessions, astro-photography...you'll find this AC adapter indispensable. This is a must have."
2,"RIP Soulja Slim, but still the truth","Soulja Slim is dead, RIP man. But heres somethings about the album, the beat was okay. Recording sounded like my bassment. The man has little flow and he is most of the times off beat. The voice is hoarse and sounds nothing like Juvenile. The guest appearances are great but Soulja Slim was so so. He is REAL, he is GANGSTA, and he is straight from the gutta, but this style barely makes up for his lack of charisma in his voice. BG is holdin it down in this album. Good thing, no 100 underground no limit artists on this album, but no C-Murder either. I have alotta respect for this guy, but this is his last album and i probably won't get to hear anything improved from this guy."
5,The 3rd Ward Magnolia's Finest,"Real recognizes real and this album was nothing else but the truth! I listen to this CD so much that sometimes it seems Slim is talking from the grave! He had a bright future ahead but, it was cut short due to playa hataz & bustaz like Master P, Krazy, & Silkk The Shocker. This album defined the original definition of this Soulja 4 Life Mentality sh#t that Slim was always talking about! Soulja Slim strictly stood for the streets & the streets loved him back for that! He was on a level of his own where couldn't nobody else see him for being the real nigga that he was! Them niggas thought that they killed him but, LEGENDS NEVER DIE! Reace In Peace Soulja Slim."
1,"Hack & Slash, with a Dash of Pentagonese","If page after yawn-inducing page of descriptions of fighting (a sort of videogame in text) thrill you, run out and buy this book. You will be entranced. If you don't find modern phrases suitable to a Pentagon press briefing jarring and out of place in a fantasy novel, the prose will sing to your soul. If characters with all the depth of 20# Laser paper satisfy you, this is *your* book."
2,Not reliable,Delivery and packing were good.This product was disappointing. It is not reliable to use for backing up as I had intended. I have several other flash drives and all of them out perform this.
3,Some songs were hard to follow,"Me and my friends were not familiar with most of the versions (melody wise) of the Christmas songs on this CD, but it served it's purpose and we had fun singing along with it anyway."
5,SUPERB INSTRUCTIONAL DVD ON HOOPS!,"This is definitely as good as it gets in terms of learning the fundamentals and mechanics to this great game that we call basketball. Rick Torbett has definitely put together some of today's finest players in terms of demonstrating different facets of the game from ballhandling, scoring the ball, post play, passing to defense. Without the fundamentals and mechanics to these different parts of the game, you can never and will ever become a true affective basketball player at any level on the court. I've been playing the game for quite a while myself and I managed to cop this set. I highly recommend this dvd for beginners as well as veteran players of the game. Because at times we can manage to get away from the little things on the court. I'd give it 10 stars if I could."
5,Wonderful Collection,"For all Doris Day fans out there, this is a ""must add"" to your collections! By the Light of the Silvery Moon and On Moonlight Bay are great musicals somewhat the same style as Meet Me in St. Louis. I'll See You in My Dreams is a bit more serious, but very excellent. My favorite is probably Romance on the High Seas, which is definitely a comedy!"
4,The Doris Day Collection,"Good collection of Doris Day's movies. Have most of them on VHS,but the DVD collection is much better, picture wise."
4,Doris Day Collector Set 2,"This set includes many of the movies Doris Day made when she was young. There are some great songs such as It's Magic, I'll See You in My Dreams, etc. The plots are typical boy meets girl, but entertaining and fun with Doris Day at her best."
2,The Doris Day Collection Vol. 2,So far the best movie of the collection is Romance on the High Seas. The other two we watched are definitely not Doris Day's best performances. We have 3 more to watch so we'll see. I highly recommend Romance on the High Seas...it's funny and Doris Day is beautiful & adorable wrapped into one.
2,Incomplete-hasn't shown up yet,"5 to 9 business days shipping turning out to be 15, but that's O.K. it was a present for my Mom...When it does show up, I'm sure she'll love it."
1,doris day fan,"Ever since I was a little girl, I have been a Doris Day Fan. I have always enjoyed all of her good musicals. Doris Day always had a smile and put on a happy face. I like what makes me happy. Doris Day always did that for me. I have all of her Musicals. I also have The Betty Grable Musicals, June Haver and Betty Hutton and so on. Anything that is musical I mostly have.Doris"
3,Glad I waited for the paperback!,"I really think Ms. Cooney should have stopped after ""Whatever Happened to Janie?"" because ""The Voice on the Radio"" was bad and ""What Janie Found"" is worse. A previous reviewer was correct when they said that this latest book had too many different points of views. I would have given anything to get into Janie's head and stayed there, but unfortunately that did not happen. Also, it was just so boring and mindless. What was the point? I just think this could have been done so much better even though I would not have minded if it hadn't been done at all."
4,WOW!,"What Janie found is the companion to The Face on the Milk Carton. This was a good book, and it ended up how I hoped it would. In this book Janie already knew she was kidnapped and she found her ""real family"" and now she wants to meet them. How scary! If you want to know what happened and what Janie found then you are going to have to read the book. Make sure you read the first book, The Face on the Milk Carton."
3,Not satisfied,"Janie realizes that Frank had been financially supporting Hannah Javensen (H.J.), his long-lost daughter and Janie's kidnapper. Janie is furious and uses a visit to her brother Stephen Spring as an excuse to see Hannah and confront her. At the end of the book, Janie finds peace with her older brother. She forgives Reeve and falls for him again, and they (supposedly) get back together at the end of the book. However, Janie never finds Hannah."
3,An alright book.,"What Janie Found, a book by Caroline Cooney, is a decent sequel to Face on the Milk Carton. It is a realistic fiction, like the whole Face on the Milk Carton series.What Janie Found is about Janie (of course). Brian is now living with Janie, while his twin is still with the Springs. Stephen went to college in Colorado. Janie's dad is in the hosiptal after a stroke and heart attack. Reeve had broken up with Janie. (old news though,this happened in Voice on th Radio)When Janie's dad was in the hospital, Janie has to work out all of the financial business.She goes through the cabinet and finds a folder labeled ""HJ"". Shocked, she immediately stops. She tries to run away from it, so she hides it. Curiosity remains, nonetheless. And so, the journey begins.I thought this book was ALRIGHT. It was not as good as the others books in the series. This book is best suited for teenage girls."
3,not a good book,"Sorry, I didn't really like this book very much. I have read all the books in the Janie series and they were all great--except this one. The beginning was rather good, but I didn't like that all the suspenses led to nothing. Cooney should have made a MUCH better ending to this book, the conclusion to the series. While I was reading this book, there were many things that I wondered about that I didn't find the answers to in the book. Sorry, I don't recommend this book, only if you want to read the whole series about Janie."
3,What Janie Found,"Just like a lot of other people i was happy to hear that there was another janie coming out, but unfortunately i found that janie did not find out that much, and therefore there was no reason to write this book. Im not saying its a bad book, it just didnt have a reason to be written. I would have been more satisfied if they had did something about hannah instead of leaving her anonymous. If i was janie i know my curiousity of finding out who hannah was would have gotten the best of me - especially if i was in the same town. I suggest that you do read this book if you want to know more about what happened to janie - even though it doesnt tell you much more - and if you have the time. It took me only a few hours to read and i think it was sort of a waste of time. I think mrs cooney is a much better writer than this book shows she is and she could have done a much better job on it. Thats all i have to say Read the book and judge it for yourself"
2,Disappointing,"The day I found out that this book was available, I went out to buy it, because I really loved the other 3 in the series. What a let-down. I felt like the whole book was just a synopsis of the other 3, and I really hate it when authors of a series do that. Finally, at about the last 2 pages, Janie, Reeve, etc. all decide abruptly how they will handle the dilemma-and the book's over. The end. I spent 16 bucks for this book, finished it in an hour, and returned it. It would have been a total waste of money if I hadn't. If you really must see what happens to Janie, wait for a paperback. It's not worth the hardback price."
3,It was okay,"Its just okay, not great. Its nothing compared to the first three books in the series. Janie finds out that her CT father has been supporting Hannah- but only for the past three years, since theyve known that Janie was a kidnapped baby. Janie isnt the only one who finds out, Brian and Reeve also know. In a twisted turn of events the three of them have to decide exactly what to do with this new sickening knowledge."
2,What Janie Found,"I'm not sure why I stuck with this series, other than I remember loving it as a teenager. This is the fourth, and final, book in the ""Face on the Milk Caron"" series. Janie's father (the one who raised her) has suffered a stroke. Janie is going through his business papers when she discovers that he has been paying off her kidnapper. She flies across the country to try and find her. I wasn't completely happy with how the characters have been developed, and overall I was just tired of the series."
3,Good Book!,"I thought this was a really good book, but I also thought that in the end she should've really met Hanna or, if Hanna is really dead, meet whoever is taking her Dad's money. It also should've said what happened between Janie and Reeve, and Janie and all four of her parents. All of the other books in the series were so good, this didn't seem like a good ending to the series. If it had more action, I think people would have liked it more too."
2,What a disappointing ending to a great series!,"I was really excited to read this book, but what a letdown. The book builds up a big confrontation and then completely fizzles out. Janie's conflict with her brother Stephen is resolved far too quickly, and her brother Stephen's girlfriend is obnoxious to a tee. Why he would ever go out with her is beyond me!I hope this isn't *really* the final book in the series because fans are still left hanging."
2,Watered-down tease of a conclusion.,"My interest in this book was high because of the build-up of the 3 other(mostly)fine books, and desire to finally KNOW something of Hannah's fate kept me immersed in the book until the end. Still, lots of frustration here: it's essentially a rehash of the earlier material, with a complete vanishing of some characters & a pointless emphasis on a cartoony, annoying girlfriend who is meant, I believe, to represent the callous outside world. I don't know. I feel disappointed in this pat, over-simplified wrap-up of a fascinating, flawed, believable bunch of decent people. Cooney may have wrung all the ""good stuff"" out of it. In that sense, I'm glad this is the conclusion, as it seems time for a rest."
5,Great Series,Couldn't wait to get the last book of the series. It came very quickly and the book was not disappointing. My whole family enjoyed the series.
5,Janie Johnson has found her peace,"Caroline B. Cooney has done it again. As a huge fan of Ms. Cooney's writing, I bought this book as soon as I could make my way over to a bookstore. As a Janie fan, reading this book, you're updated on her life and it is the conclusion to her drama. All of the Springs and Johnsons have found their own peace in this conclusion. No exception to Caroline B. Cooney's usual writing, this book is excellently detailed and written."
2,Weak end to a decent series,"To go as far as the last two books but then not confront and punish the malefactor Hannah made this book and its predecessor a waste of time to read. Cooney started with a great idea but ran out of steam after ""Whatever Happened to Janie?"" Stick with that book and ""Face on the Milk Carton"" and you won't go wrong."
2,Well...,"I quite enjoyed the book, but it certainly wasn't as good as the first one of the Janie series. It's pretty sweet when she makes up with her boyfriend and finds out the truth. But the ending just isn't powerful enough. It's like one of those books where it holds you in suspense for the first twenty-nine chapters then on chapter thirty the end line is something like, ""And I woke up and it was all a dream"". *sigh* If you really have nothing to read, then go ahead and buy this book."
5,A Great Conclusion,I like how Janie isn't obsesed with destroying Hannah. She just wants the whole problem to be over. The way she ended the money problem brought an end to the pain of her kidnapping.
2,Disappointment plus!,"I loved the first three ""Janie"" books but this onewas a big yawn! Enough psychobabble and interpersonal reactions. Ikept waiting for all the anaylsying to pay off and it never did. The point of this story was all over the place and the characters are so annoying that you want Hannah to show up just to add some spice to the mix. As for Stephen's girlfriend, why would he just suddenly find her so annoying? She annoyed me from the second she was introduced. And then they make up straight away after she insults him and his family! I kept waiting for the action to happen and it never did. I think the story should have ended with book 3. Bummer!"
3,um,"i didn't really care for this book . Although I do like the book that Caroline B. Cooney has writen . She is a good authur , but this is not the best book she has wrote . Out of 'the face on the milk carton ', 'whatever happened 2 janie ',the voice on the radio ',and what janie found', I would have 2 say that 'whatever happened to janie' was the best book . so if u r 2 buy this book make sure to buy the other book in this series ."
3,A Disappointing Conclusion,"Caroline B. Cooney weaves a fantastic tale in her conclusion to Janie's story. But the closure for Janie and her family was not the closure THIS reader wanted. (If you don't want to know what happens, don't read on....)Hannah is never caught or confronted. Hannah is never made to pay for the pain and suffering she caused to the Johnons and Springs. I would have much preferred to see what happened if Janie did meet up with Hannah, rather than having Hannah remain elusive."
5,another great Nicole Wilde book!,I have become a fan of Nicole Wilde and have several of her books on dogs and dog training. This book doesn't disappoint. Nicole gives clear observations on what your dog is feeling and how to approach the problems and help your dog overcome his/her fears and what may cause them.She obviously loves dogs and it shows in her books. I would definitely recommend this book for any dog owner - especially if you adopted from a rescue or shelter to help understand the dog's reactions.
3,Helpful for newbies,"I ordered on a whim. Been in dogs for over 25 years, doing training, etc.. I've had dogs my entire life, people say I was raised by wolves, but if you 'weren't' this is actually pretty helpful. Have some well timed photographs to refer to with good explanations.I think this would be good reference material for animal shelters, and even first time dog owners, who are OFTEN confused by what their dogs 'intent' is when meeting new people and new animals.. There are still so many people who think that a wagging tail means the dog is friendly - no matter what the rest of the dog is telling them."
4,great resource for reading dog body language,"If you want to better understand what your dog is expressing, this book will give you a handy reference guide to reading dog body language. Some of the photos are a bit difficult to see what she is describing, but for the most part, it's very good. While you can learn a lot from this book, be prepared for an awful editing job. They must have been in a rush to get it to print as there are a lot of mistakes. It is a bit pricey and long (at 370 pages!), but if you are really interested in learning more about dogs and how to read them, this is worth adding to your collection. Hopefully they have produced a newer edition that was better edited."
4,"Good book on Dog ""Language""","A good primer on what dogs are saying, doing, or about to do by their body language.The photographs are instructive and illustrate the many signals dogs can send with their bodies, tails, eyes, mouths, and their tongues. One can learn not only how dogs communicate with other dogs, but also (try to) communicate with humans. My one issue with this book is that it has been seriously under-edited. Many photos and much of the text are redundant, For example the chapter ""This is my territory"" is 22 pages long (pgs. 214-236) and could have easily been cut to six or less. That and overly long explanations, and over-use of poor quality photos made the book for me, a bit of a wade. Otherwise, I would have given this book five stars."
3,good but somewhat confusing,"Overall, it had a good layout with lots of pictures. I secretly found myself wishing the author had updated some of the dark, less clear, out-of-focus, or grainy photos with some better ones. Expecially when a dark, grainy picture was blown-up to highlight a certain detail and it just heighted the overall bad aspect of the original photo used. Considering how many times this book has been reprinted there is no excuse for this.That aside it is a good book for people who are not use to working with large groups of dogs nor have the opportunity of watching their dog interact with stranger dogs to understand a bit of what is going on. This book at least gives peole an opportunity to define and give verbiage to a non-verbal form of communication. People panic way to much and blame the wrong dog as the aggressor or mistake that is occuring causing confusion between the owners and the dogs themselves."
4,Canine Body Language: A Photographic Guide,"I found this a fascinating book. I bought a copy on a whim for my dad for Xmas, then thought it looked so interesting that I bought myself a copy days later. It is along the lines of some of Turid Rugaas' work, talking about and showing in photos some of the body language dogs exhibit. I've always found it interesting that I can watch two of my dogs interacting and say ""that's just play"" whereas my parents think they are trying to kill each other, or they might think everything is fine but I saw an ear movement that tells ME there is trouble brewing. This book explains and shows some of the minute details of doggie body language that I am reading. And after reading the book, my dad was able to understand what he should be looking for, and he can actually see the dogs' communication much better. The photo quality in the book is not the best, but along with the engaging text, gets the message across."
3,Crappy Photos for a 'Photographic Guide'...,"I was very disappointed in this book. Since this book is supposed to be a photographic guide, I thought it would have good quality color photos in it. Instead, they are all grainy, blurry, black & white pictures. Some of the text is missing (?????????) on a couple pages, it just stops mid-sentence & does not continue onto the next page or anywhere else on the page. I did give it an 'It's Ok' rating though, because despite the bad photos & horrible editing, the author does explain in fairly good detail what specifically is going on in the dogs' minds when they are displaying certain looks or behaviors. But unless you have experience personally with dogs & can just know what the author is talking about, it would be hard to learn just from viewing the photos in this book. They aren't good enough quality photos for the novice dog owner/trainer to catch some of the more subtle 'looks' in the dogs pictured."
3,A lot of good information,"This book is very heavy on information maybe more so than just an owner would need. I am having a hard time digesting it all and really seeing from the pictures what the author sees. Someone more in the lines of being a trainer, doggy daycare or something like that might get more use out of this. My reason for purchasing was to try to have the tools I needed when encountering other dogs when I walk my dog or are even just out walking myself. Also when my dog is playing with another dog to understand when play is starting to escalate into a fight. Probably would not have ordered if I had known."
5,Canine Body Language,"This book is absolutely wonderful! As a new dog trainer it has helped me tremendously in aiding understanding of the dog and his/her reactions to the world around him.I am able to read a dog more easily and although I knew some of the signs of the ""language"" already, the book was very helpful in discussing and pointing out the far more subtle ones. The huge amount of pictures makes it easier to equate a description of the language to it's real-life counterpart. I think this book is great!"
4,great book to learn about the language of dogs,I really like all the pictures used in this book to demonstrate the concepts being described in the text. While some pictures are blurry you can still get the idea. I think dog owners should learn more about the communication of their dogs.
5,excellent,"excelent choice for this luxury watch, box and details beautiful for halfthe price at least"
5,A different view,"In response to xmaggie mayx, Mary Baxter was allowed to view have and write the accounts that see saw. She's not the only one who has written accounts of heaven. Jesse Duplantis has and excellent book about heaven. His views are similar to Mary's but he gives additional differents views of heaven. I love both accounts and they both say that there are sections of heaven they were not allowed to write about. If you feel that Mary Baxter and other are false prohpets then pray for them. You can't knock someone who's helping to get people saved."
3,Confused,"I read this book after reading her book about Hell.The hell book was a bit unsettling. She describes and calls one area of hell""the fun center"". HUH, also she states that the devil and the demons torment souls in hell.According to Pastor and author Erwin W. Lutzer a quote from his book ""One Minute After You Die""""Be assured of this:Neither the devil or his angels will torment people in hell.Satan and his demons will be among the tormented,they will not be the tormentors"".(Revelation20:10)This is a direct opposition to the word of God...So her revelations are maybe not that divinely inspired.The book is nice and is comforting in some area's, but if she is off scripture I don't know what to really believe.I have all the books and am reading The Spirit Realm one. I guess we all should trust our own relationship with Christ."
5,10 STARS,I LOVE MY BOOK IT WAS DELIVERED BEFORE IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE HERE AND IT WAS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION
1,ORE-EXIT!!!!!!!!,"REVIEWS ?????? ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS I HAVE A FREE SIX MONTHS SUPPLY FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS IT . ME 36 LIKE BIG DADDY SAYS ""I GOES TO WORK"" GOES TO WORK ."
2,meh,"This may work for some, but for me is was only one more pill to take. Meh! It did nothing, but then again, like chicken soup, it couldn't hurt."
3,Won't buy more,"I am in my early 60s, healthy, and dating a mid-30s lady. I don't really have the problem this product addresses but wanted it for increased ""staying power"". I tried 2 others which really worked but one was pulled off the market by the FDA and the other is no longer made. This one doesn't seem to do much for me but at least I have no side effects."
3,Do your research.,"I order from Amazon because a lot of the time, I can get it less expensive than if I go straight to the manufacturer and this goes with a lot of products. Orexis is an okay product because when you get up there in age, you find that supplementation to keep your body ready is more effective & less risky than prescribed meds plsu their not as expensive. But do your research and look for a money back guarantee. More expensive doesn't always mean better. This product is like a multivitamen for that part of the body, it does keep me ready & feeling frisky all the time."
1,Total bummer,"This will cause the opposite effect; I call it ""sudden deflation""; or else total wet noodle."
4,Maybe,"A little hard to tell. Seems to have an effect in the AM, so testostrone is in play a bit. I would try again."
2,didnt work well!,"Orexis Works ok at first couple pills, the it stops to gain the same result. However, I have tried many others out there. I have foundDouble V - Vazogel & Virectin Sex Enhancement COMBO is edible, orgasm-inducing, all-natural, ionized water-based gel for him and her, and 12 pills bottle that works very instantly as well. It is very powerful combination compare just pills itself alone."
1,I cant sleep,I tried once... not a rock hard erection... and I could not sleep. no bueno.. plus i felt as if I was going to have a heart attack.... The site... mens blog health is crap i should've checked amazon first... sending back
1,Not Good,"I am nearly at the end of the second box and have noticed no change at all, should have been suspicious when there were no specifics on the ingredients. I have had success with other products but nothing with Orxis, only use this as a very last resort but I would not recommend it."
1,Pain in the groin,"I ordered a 90-day supply of this product. This is the 4th different product I have tried without success. But this one caused a painful swelling in my groin area after only 3 days. I had no such reaction from the others. After stopping for a week, the pain and swelling went away. Just to rule out coincidence, I took them for 2 days and the painful swelling returned. A painful waste of money.OREXIS 60 CAPS MALE SEXUAL ENHANCEMENT 30 DAY SUPPLY"
2,Review of Orexis,"60 year old male in very good health and good condition but fading libedo. Have taken 2 capsules of Orexis per day for last 30 days with no decernable effect. The possibity of a minor change is the only reason for the 2 instead of a zero or 1 star.No side effects so the possiblity that some of the contents might have a long term value might make this product worthwhile if cost is not a consideration. Otherwise, suspect that off-the-shelf vitamens might be equally good and effective."
4,Works Great for the cost,Orexis works great. Better stamina and erections. The price is right as well. My wife enjoyed the results of the product as well.
3,Orexis is SO SO,"I tried a month's supply of Orexis and had minimal results. I did notice some improvement, but nothing to rave about. I doubt that I will purchase this again. Keep in mind however, that I am 50 years old. This product may work better for someone younger, but I can't answer that."
4,The Best of the Best Songs!,It was a better compilation than expected. It has all the great songs. The real only compilation of all their greatest hits.
4,pleasantly suprised,I have had no problems with these cartridges. They seem to work as well as original epson cartridges.I was expecting to notice a lower print quality (since they are so much cheaper) but was pleasantly suprised when I didn't.The only difference I noticed (from genuine epson cartridges) is that you can detect an alcohol-like odor right after a page is printed; it vanishes quickly as the ink dries on the paper.
4,Insight into another culture,"Not a fan of poetry, I was surprised to find this book quite interesting. It helped me see the world from a different point of view. It is well written and I would suggest it to readers whether they are familiar with Native American culture or want to broaden their horizons."
5,Great fun!,"I loved this little mystery! I am a Texan and a librarian, so I bought it for myself at the Texas Book Festival in Austin. I think we have found a new author for our library, we are ordering a couple of copies-my own copy is a keeper! I can usually guess the ""murderer"" before the end-but this one had me fooled. It is too bad it takes you 5 weeks to order it-this gal is great fun!"
1,High School Musical,"I was dissappointed, thought I was getting complete sound track.I will check out product better next time I am shopping. Thank you"
3,dont say complete in which its not,it says a complete kit but you have go buy the retainers that you need to hook them up to your exhaust which is about 45.00 more out of pocket for total of 230.00 which i can get it cheaper for 205.00 at the super store same day
5,a voice to be shared with the world.,"I was lucky enough to be in the Windy City on a night when Jen Dainton was performing and immediately purchased 5 of her CDs for myself and family members. Folksy, bluesy and jazzy, this girl can do it all. The range of her voice is unbelievable as is the quality and clarity. I do not know which song-- Forgotten, Honest Jane or What It's Like--would be my favorite. Broad subject range from social injustices, child abuse, death of a spouse, all the way to the miracle of birth(Meredith's Song) What a God-given talent this young woman has and a voice that must be shared with the world--unique, soothing and very beautiful!!!!"
2,Very simplistic,"I was not expecting this book to be quite as small and simple as it is. It's physically very small and thin, and has very simple text. It may be good for an early reader, and it may be good for a young toddler who is being read to, but not so good for an almost 4 year old who would like a little more information. (Example: 1st page: ""We are firefighters. We work at the fire station."")"
2,Reinforces sexual and racial stereotypes,"I bought this book for my two-year-old daughter, who is very interested in firefighters and fire trucks. It has great photographs, which I think make the book more interesting than an illustrated book. The text is simple and appropriate for very young children.However, not only are all the firefighters shown are male, which may be representative of reality, but the only two women in the entire book appear on the last page, apparently thanking the firefighters for helping them. This perpetuates the stereotype of big strong men taking care of helpless women, which disappointed me. Also, every single person in this book is white, which definitely is not representative of reality.This book would have been darn near perfect if it reflected some racial and sexual diversity, but as it is, I won't be sharing it with my daughter."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"""Heavy Duty""? I think not!This hose failed the second time we used it. The material is about as thick as celophane. I'd send it back, but the Post Office takes a dim view of sending hazardous materials.Spend the extra money and get a hose that is genuinely ""Heavy Duty""."
5,Washburn and Cherici leave no doubt !!,Washburn and Cherici leave no doubt that Dr. Cook was a fraud. The book carefully lays out its claim in undisputable evidence both through text and pictures.I couldn't put the book down. I will be surprised if this work doesn't nail the lid on the century long controversy.
5,Swept Away,"What I look for is intensity, or better yet conviction. There is a massive sound here, combined with searching ambition. Son's lines are uniquely introspective, with moments that made me want to stop the song and write something down: ""Check the depths of my reaches, man/Where the secrets ran/And all the broken pieces land"". Generally, the songs make you want to stand up straighter, and the lyrics ring with the credibility of a street poet's authority, vulnerable yet commanding: ""Check your jeans, miss/Cause I hit the scene with/Everything you dream with"".I agree with past reviewers that this album is different from all the bland corporate product of the new millenium. Like the better rock albums of the last decade, this album is thoughtful and gets its thunder from distilling personal experiences. It's rocks harder for being honest and you'll know the difference."
1,It's flying off the shelves...,and into the trash. Wil it break Amazon's three-hundred-thousandth best-selling? Only time (and tears) wil tell.
4,T.S.Eliot's poems,"The poems written by T.S.Eliot are extremely enticing poems in the way that they carry various themes which have been used throughout. These themes hold a strong message and I believe that the message that is depicted from Eliot gives us a way to think forward about our own lives. Eliot aims to search for the meaning of life, something we all hope to discover. However, soon after I read these peoms I understood that ""life"" does not have only one definition. People see life in different ways and have different perspectives and the experiences they have, may dismiss what they once thought life was about. Therefore, my message to all my readers, is that do not waste time searching for what cannot be found! Thankyou! Katrina Kang"
4,a good edition of Eliot for the casual reader,"I found this edition by Penguin to be very useful for a casual reading. The notes on the poems, in particular ""the Waste Land,"" are detailed enough to give the reader a perception of Eliot's vast literary knowledge and its effect on his poems. However, the notes are inadequate if your purpose is to deeply understand the background of Eliot's complex and difficult poetry. So if you are looking for deep insights, I would recommend the Norton Critical Edition. For the normal reader, this is satisfying and straightforward."
2,The Waste Land -- Audio CD -- www.bnpublishing.com,"The Waste LandFrom the listing this item appears to be a recording of The Waste Land by T.S. Eliot, read by the poet himself; but it's not, it's a performance by another reader, and therefore it had (to me) no interest; it was not what I wanted or needed. I suggest that the product description should be made clearer, so that other customers do not make the same mistake."
1,To slow,I recommend the type H for usage in cameras instead of type Mas H is the high speed version. A higher speed is more usefullwhen you try to take a couple of pictures in a short time orwhen you review the pictures already taken.
5,Excellent Book,"I was initially put off by the title, thinking that this might be written for junior readers. But once I began reading it I realized that this was far from the truth.The book is very well written, and very informative. It gives a very mature insight into the HK-1 project, as well as Howard Hughes himself.I highly recommend this book to anybody wanting a detailed account of the events pertaining to Howard Hughes and His Flying Boat."
3,"Predictable after all these years, but...","The Brady Bunch was a good show when it was on. However this TVM is so artificial with its corny jokes and unconvincing family (no offense Mr. and Mrs. Brady, but Tom and Jerry were more lifelike than your bunch even on the show!) that it was not funny but cynical, something that it wasn't meant to be. Although there are some commendable antics, this was a waste of time for all the former cast members."
4,A Very Brady Christmas Should Be On DVD!,The Brady Bunch is one of my favorite TV shows and I liked the TV movies especially A Very Brady Christmas which was a cute movie and yes it would have been great if Susan Oleson had played Cindy but the girl who played her though not as good as Susan Oleson was fine and I highly recommend this movie and I really would like for it to be transferred to DVD!
4,The best Corny Movie Ever produced,"This movie has become a Christmas tradition in my family. I have never seen anything so corny in my LIFE...the BEST line of all comes when the kids are at the dinner table taking turns making confessions of their secrets. Marcia's wimpy husband, Wally, has just apologized to the family for some insanely ridiculous wrongdoing, and Marcia turns to him and adoringly says (in a way that only Marcia can)...""Oh, Wally, don't be sorry, just be.. Wally!"".I swear I thought I would fall off my chair laughing when I heard that...Of course, I REALLY DID fall off my chair in spasms of hysterical laughter when Carol stands at the police line singing into the rubble that has trapped Mike, and miraculously he emerges from the ruins...OH...it doesn't get any better than that. I WISH IT WAS ON DVD!"
5,Everyone Needs This,This is by far the most ridiculous Christmas movie I have ever seen in my life. Which is why I love it so much! I can't believe they don't play this on Lifetime a few times over the holidays it's so incredibly campy you'll be in stitches watching it. My whole family gets together every year to goof on this movie and tear it to shreds and it's a great time. If you're a Brady Bunch fan you owe it to yourself to own this movie!
4,"Nice, but.....","It's well made, quieter than most, and gives a good scratch and roll.....BUT it didn't conform to my arch. I think it needs more curve, or one end to be raised like I saw on one of the others. I bought it for my PF and it won't work for that. However, what it does do, it does well so I will get others for gifts for friends who don't have PF."
1,"Cheap, useless","I had ordered this as a Christmas present and ended up returning it. Right away. I took it out of the box and felt how lightweight and cheaply made it was and pretty much packed it right back up. This will not stay still for you to rub your feet on, unless perhaps you nail it to the floor. The rollers are very hard, spiney and improperly molded plastic pieces. Bad, bad, bad."
1,NOt at all what I wanted,"Wow after reading the reviews I really wish I would have received the same results. I usually don't have ticklish feet and this product just makes me remove my feet as soon as I put them on. I have tried wearing socks to feel less of that sensation, it does help but just not for me.I feel the massagers need to be less pointy, they tickle me very much makes me feel anxious."
2,Not terribly effective,"I agree with a another reviewer who refers to the rollers being totally inflexible. The unit is well built, but the rollers need to be made from considerably softer material. The unit does provide some massage, but not nearly as much as I had hoped."
1,The Rock,This thing is hard as a rock. Like walking on pebbles. I received no effect from it whatsoever.
1,Useless.,This item was totally useless to me. Using this contraption to massage my aching feet was about as effective as using a AA battery to bring a dead person back to life. It just doesn't do anything.
1,"Paid for never receive item, no responses","Paid for never receive item, no responses after multiple messages!Don't buy from this store."
1,Spikey/painful,"THE IDEA VERY GOOD, BUT THE SPIKES ON THE ROLLERS WERE VERY HARD, POINTY, AND PAINFUL TO THE FEET. IF THE SPIKES WERE FLAT AND THE RUBBER SOFTER, IT WOULD BE AWESOME! and I would definitely recommend it for my clients.I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO KNOW THAT THE ""BLUE PART"" WERE HARD AND SPIKEY. IT FELT LIKE NEEDLES ON MY FEET. I ALSO ASKED MY ROOMMATE TO TRY IT AND SHE HAD THE SAME REACTION."
3,Alright,This product is just allright. It feels ok but it's not so great that I'm motivated to use it often. It sits under my desk collecting dust.
3,More like a tickler than a foot messager,"I bought this for myself, but it my daughters use it more. They get a lot of laughter and giggling out of this thing. If you are looking for a foot messager, keep looking people."
1,Poorly made,The roller broke after a couple of uses. The rods supporting the rolling wheels are flimsy. Will not recommend this to anyone!
4,Sliding review of the wedge...,"Overall, this appears to be a good aid for reducing the effects of acid reflux.Pluses:The pillow arrived on time, was packaged well (good carrying case), and was easy to understand how to use.Minuses:I tend to slide down the pillow through the night. It would be nice if the pillow-case might have been designed to promote less slippage. And, in general, snuggling is not possible."
3,Not for those that turn a lot.,"I bought this pillow for my recovery time after my hysterectomy, and I had tried it out a few nights before just to get a feel of it. Well, that night I ended up ditching about halfway through my sleep because it just wasn't comfortable enough, and the same goes for all of the nights following my surgery.I'm one that likes to toss and turn a lot, so having such a narrow platform to lay on just made me uneasy.One way in which I put it to use, in which it worked quite well, was to use it in elevating my legs, but that makes for a very expensive leg pillow.Other than that, I'm sure that those whom can lie flat on their backs and sleep will enjoy it."
3,MedSlant Pillow,Received item as described and on time. I am unable to use it for very long because it is uncomfortable to sleep on.
5,"Dude, feel like this saved my life","I was sick for a month & it all came to a head one night when I aspirated stomach acid in my lungs. That in turn caused another month where I had extreme asthma, layrngeal spasms & terrible drainage. After just a few days using this pillow I started to improve & nearly a month later I'm almost 100% back to normal. This was a great great help & I couldn't feel better about the purchase. Now, if they just made a MedSlant that would allow me to lower the angle slowly so I can get back to sleeping flat again. Thanks Guys!"
5,You will sleep better!,"""It took a couple of nights for me to adjust to the wedge pillow. I have had it for about one month and I love mine now. It has helped me sleep much deeper and reduced my problems with snoring, coughing, reflux, and sleep apnea. I bought a second one for my husband--after a couple of nights he still could not get used to it. We gave it to our 33-year-old daughter and she says it has helped her sleep better from the very first night."""
2,wedge pillow,The pillow is very uncomfortable and not at all what I thought it would be.In fact I would like to request a refund.
3,a better nights sleep,i got this for husband he has acid reflux some nights he said it helps others not so much it came with cover didnt read that so ordered one just to let u no if u order one u dont have to order cover comes with one
2,Too short and steep,"This product is OK. My husband does not want the whole bed angled up. I bought this one because it was longer than some others for sale. You do tend to slide down it at night. I'm a side and stomach sleeper and can't get comfy with this laying on my side or my stomach. My hips naturally want to be at the end where the pillow meets the bed and it kind of causes my lower back to hurt.I'm pretty sure this is the best option out there, but I'm looking into getting a custom one made that is longer, so my hips don't bend at the bed-pillow-line and one with a hole so that when I lay on my stomach my head can go into the hole like on a massage table. Otherwise, you head cranes up at a big angle and makes your neck hurt."
1,Okay if you like sleeping on a twin bed,"This pillow is narrow, so in spite of having a king-size bed, I am relegated to sleeping in a tiny space. It is foldable which sounds like a good idea, but the break in the wedge allowing it to fold results in a dip about halfway down the pillow so your chest caves in weirdly. I would return it if I still had the packaging. Many on the market far cheaper; I would try them first."
2,"Too Hard, Caused back aches","This product was disappointing. As someone who has slept on a wedge for2 years for my reflux (I am 47), I am used to the elevated position. I wanted the Medslant pillow because it has its own carrying case and had a dust mite cover (which really is flimsy and I doesn't cover the whole pillow!)Well, the Medslant is so hard and uncomfortable, after 4 nights of trying, I gave up since I could not sleep deeply. It caused an achy back.When I called the company about returning it, the said it was a personalitem and could NOT be exchanged. So, I am out almost $100 for a useless item."
4,Product helps my wife sleep,"My wife suffers from acid reflux and has a hard time falling asleep. This pillow let's her stomach settle down within a half-hour and allows her to fall asleep. She doesn't need it every night, but when she does, it works every time. The folding feature is useful for storing by the bedside."
3,works for reflux..overpriced,"No foam smell is wonderful, but staying on this wedge is almost impossible. Wedge is twin sized on a king sized bed...and either the pillow, or you, are sliding down, or off sideways, but it works for reflux.. if you can stay on it. A wider wedge would be much better, or one for a king sized bed that two people could sleep on, much nicer for your spouse too. (Could help with snoring) Cover is for the top of the wedge only (like a fitted sheet) and way overpriced too."
3,Expensive,"Helps with my reflux but unfortunately does what most wedges do, it causes one to slide down the wedge while sleeping. For this price the surface should be made of Tempurpedic foam which would help with this problem."
3,Holds my Sponge,"I got this to set my sponge on so it would dry out. It does just that, I throw it in the dish washer every once in a while to clean. Serves it's function well for a good price."
1,Beware!,This product looks like it would function fine but I had to return it when I saw that writted on the actual package was a warning about the materials being linked with causing cancer. It's not just worth it to have in my home.
2,So close,"From the picture, it looks like there's enough of a ""bowl"" to collect the water when it drains off the soap. Yes, the prongs (on both sides) will allow the soap to drain but I leave my bars of soap on top of the kitchen and bathroom sinks. No bowl. In fact, there are holes in the bottom of this thing so the water is going to keep draining onto the sink tops solving nothing unless I find some kind of small bowl it will fit into to catch the water (I don't have anything like that.). In that case, I won't need the soap saver. And it's made in CHINA where they sit around the supper table laughing at us for what they did to the Americans today. If they'd just recessed the bottom enough to catch the water and left the holes out . . . Sometimes I get the feeling they're doing all this bad designing/engineering on purpose because it is soooo consistent."
3,"A bit messy, but does the job.","It may just be the brand of soap that I buy (Dove), but it really cakes up on the soap saver which doesn't really allow the bottom of the bar to dry. It creates quite a mess, but still less messy than if the soap were sitting directly on the counter and it cleans fairly easily. Item is flexible but sturdy."
4,Cheap and functional. No dripper tray.,"Well, this product is straightforward. It's not very grippy on the bottom, but it grip onto the soap on top. No dripper tray so water does leak through. For the price, it's a basic soap saver. It saves your soap but not your sink."
5,Perfect!,"I saw this type of device while showering at a friends house and thought it was a good idea. I never really thought to purchase my own until I kept on throwing away half used and mushy bars of soap. Its an amazing cheap and easy device. I recommend it to everyone who hates mushy, wasted soap. Also, I think this device helps keep the shower clean for longer."
4,It works,"This soap holder is not the best looking one out there, but it suits its purpose. Definitely a functional product. I like that I can throw it in the dishwasher when it gets all scuzzy."
1,Terrible Quality,The quality of this cable sucks. If they are going to make a 100FT cable they need to make it with some kind of amplifier. Don't purchase this cable if you want to be able to actually read text. I regret buying this cable.
3,"Good Construction, bad signal","This is a well put together cable, the biggest problem is that is not isolated enough to avoid screen phantoms on high resolutions (over 1680x1050)Will still use it on old systems but had to purchase another one a little more expensive from a retail store nearby."
4,Great for the money plus! an awesome connection!,I used this cord to attach my monitor to my Vizio tV which when both plugged in had amazing reception! I am happy with my purchase but however disappointed its so heavy. 4/5
5,Does the job,"This cable is built with great quality and accurately delivers the vga signal. I considered buying something cheaper, but Tripp Lite's lifetime warranty won me over. It's been over 2 months, and so far, so good."
2,Missing the plug-and-play pin,"A little bit of VGA history: There used to be a missing pin in the array, to make it even harder to plug a cable in backwards; if it didn't have a pin missing there, the lack of a hole in the port would prevent the cable from being inserted.This is that kind of cable.Unfortunately, clever computer manufacturers got better ideas, and that one pin is now used to carry monitor geometry information. This is how Windows knows, without special configuration for an individual monitor, what range of sizes and resolutions your monitor can support. This pin is missing on this cable, however, so you'll have to fend for yourself.If you have a monitor of nonstandard resolution (for example, it's actually an HDTV with a VGA jack), Windows won't be able to give you the matching resolution.Good cable for standard monitors, unusable for monitors of nonstandard resolution."
5,SVGA Cable,"Cable works greatThis cable has male connectors at both ends,so check what you need.You may need a male/female converter as well."
2,Not as Advertised,"I bought this expecting a Tripp Lite Gold Plated SVGA cable. What I got was some other no name brand made in China with silver plated tips and a Tripp Lite sticker attached. This is kind of ironic in that the product ad states, ""Accept no substitutes! To ensure that the Tripp Lite cable you purchase will deliver the superior performance you expect, purchase it directly through Amazon.com. Your cable will be shipped to you in its original Tripp Lite packaging (poly bag with Tripp Lite logo; see photo). This is your assurance that the cable you purchased is a genuine Tripp Lite product. And if you don't see this packaging, it's not a genuine Tripp Lite cable!"" The cable was cheap enough and works OK for what I need so I will keep it. But you need to be careful if you are wanting the actual Tripp List P502-015 SVGA cable because you do not get it! By the way my cable came through MarginMart, Inc. Guess I should have followed the quoted text and bought directly from Amazon."
5,It's a monitor cable innit,"Does what's it supposed to for a great price. Connects a computer to a monitor, TV or any other compatible display device, no problem. And it has gold on it, ooooo."
2,"wasn't right for me, sent back","wasn't right for me, sent back. yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda"
1,USELESS,Useless. Tried to connect an HP laptop to and normal computer LCD and did not work. THIS IS NOT THE CABLE IN THE PICTURE but it is Tripp Lite. Could not return since I did not tried it on time. My bad now Im stuck with $10 in garbage
3,Good product,"This is good product! I use it to connect my computer to Sony LCD 46"". Unfortunately, the picture was no good, I had to used HDMI cable instead of. Anyway, for any purpose, I think this item is good!"
2,"""Nix"" to Penaten Puder!","Penaten Baby Cream is an awsome product! I had used it in Germany 30 years ago on my infant son and was sorry I did not bring a ""truck load"" of it home with me. I tried to get a pharmacist to stock it here in the States but at the time they thought I had an unusual request and were at a loss as to how to make it happen. I was excited to see I could buy it on the internet for my grandchildren. Because I knew how wonderful Penaten Cream was I decided to try other products. Could they be as awsome? One choice was Penaten Puder. It was expensive but no better than regular baby powder we get here in the States. Why pay more? It says it is made in Germany but also has that familiar ""Johnson&Johnson"" logo on the container as well. Unless someone knows something about this product that I don't I would not recommend it over our local products."
3,"On The Day You Were Born, A bit overrated",Friends raved about this book so I got it for a new baby in the family.The words are truly lovely but the pictures are very disappointing. This couldhave been beautifully illustrated.
5,This book filled me with awe and reverence ...,"This book filled me with awe and reverence... for the mircale of birth, yes...but, much more: for all the incredible creation around us, and the incredible creations we ALL are...I've just read this book...and will be reading it often in the future, I'm sure...It's a lovely book for welcoming newborns and for children to help them see their place in the world...BUT...my first copy will be a gift to a friend who will be 69 this week-end! It is a perfect expression of gladness and thanksgiving for the life of anyone you love and care about! I'm sure many relatives and friends will be getting copies from me soon!"
2,Not for Toddlers or Babies,"My 2 year old has never been interested in this book, and he loves to be read to. If I pick it up, he usually pushes it aside and grabs another one. I think the problem is that the pictures are abstract and not really representative of the words. Toddlers and babies like to be able to recognize objects on a page. This book doesn't feature animals they know (dog, cat, lion, fish) but instead shows exotic animals even I'm not familiar with (arctic tern). Also, the people in the book don't have faces, which are interesting to babies and toddlers. If you want a touching story that your baby or toddler will also appreciate, I would recommend ""Love You Forever"" instead."
2,Average,"Based on the reviews, I bought this book for my nephew's first birthday.The concept was great, but the abstract pictures and abstract poetry, I believe, does not resonate with the reader, be it adult or child."
3,"The Little One Enjoys It...Me, Not So Much","My 1 yr old son enjoys having this read to him; however, my tongue doesn't. I find this book miserable to read. Unlike other books which tend to have more rhyme and rhythm, this one just has waaaaaaay too many adjectives and I find myself stumbling over the long sentences. Sometimes I even leave a few words out!You may argue that it's the message that really counts (albiet this book tends to be a little mushy about it), but at the end of day, after having had my patience tried more times than I'd like to think, having to plow through this book is the last thing I want to do.The illustrations are wonderful and my son DOES enjoy the book, and so I give it three stars for that."
2,Not as interesting as expected,"I was a bit disappointed with this book. The poetry is not really appropriate to read to young children- they just wouldn't understand it. And the imagery was a bit abstract. I think this book is really better suited for a coffee table adult read, rather than something to share with your children."
1,On the Day You Were Bored,"I couldn't wait to get thru this book so Icould put it away. It was a huge yawn. Itcontains the myth that a newborn is the centerof the Universe. Within the myth there is afocus on, what else, the newborn.Other cultures have much more elegant andmeaningful myths. There is no doubt that thebirth of a child is very special. However,this cruddy narcissictic tale does littleto illuminate this fact. Notice how non-related the characters are to one another.It reminded me of those Vtech electornictoys that light up a figure randomly.Yuck-o. Does the Collective really wantto give this 4-1/2 Stars?Check out ""Owl Moon""; it is so much deeperand satisfying a tale!"
1,This book is horrible!!!!,"Not for toddlers at all!! This book uses way too many big words, it's hard to read, the words just don't flow easily. I thought this book would be much more entertaining for toddlers but it isn't."
4,From parent to child,"I bought this book for my son as a birthday present, as he and I both like stories with Native American influences. He has read it many times since receiving it, especially when he wants to feel closer to me or to get through a bad day. This book is a wonderful addition to any young child's collection of stories."
5,Simply beautiful,A wonderfully piece of work. Great artwork with beautifully poetic prose.Great gift for new arrivals to this world. Well deserved honors.Liked it so much we bought one for each of our children when they were born and for a few other close family members.
5,Wonderful!,I really enjoyed every minute of this book. The subplots were real and entertaining - not just filler like so many others. The main plot moved along very briskly with lots of murder along the way. The charactors felt like people I knew and having the story based in Denver was a refreshing change.
5,Excellent!,"This is a very good mystery but as a former 20 yr. resident I find it very distracting to the story to read ""public service"" when the story is referring to the utility co. It should be Public Service which is the utility co. of the Denver metro area. The editor has done the author a disservice with this error. Buy the book anyway and know it is not a do-good organization responding to a murder scene!"
1,Poor quality - Avoid this teapot!,"The quality of this teapot is extremely poor. Very thin metal, problematic handles top and bottom - but the real problem is the supposed ""stainless steel"". I used this product for less than two weeks before a ring of rust began to appear on the small upper pot. Don't waste your money on this teapot!"
2,Turkish- not Chinese-yes Samovar,This was a mistake to order. $34.99 for Chinese garbage. Very dissapointed. I was looking for a real Samovar. This oone is rusting after just a few weeks.
4,Good Tea Pot,"This tea pot is light and serves its purpose. It will start to rust on the inside around the spount, and I am unsure on how to prevent that from happening. It does its job."
5,From a longtime gardner,"Wow, what a beautiful book full of detailed fine photographs of roses. I agree with all the reviews, but wanted to mention there are revised editions of this book, 1999, 2001, 2005 that describe zones 1-12 in North America, not just Canada. My copy (1999) doesn't have the problem that some of the below reviewers mentioned about using the temp zones in Canada only. Also, this is such a huge, heavy book, I can't imagine adding any more written information to it. The binding will become compromised. Maybe this doesn't have ALL the information some rose experts need, but it is one of the finest books I've bought on plants, and I've bought a lot in my lifetime."
1,Botanic's Roses The Encyclopedia of Roses,"It is a beautiful book and if that is what you are looking for this is a great book. However, Amazon forgot to mention this is for Canada. Page 21 displays temperate zones for (CANADA ONLY). Again Page 21 ""Zones 9-12 do not occur in Canada""? Many roses in this book are zones 9 and above---what is the temperature of 9 and above????? I live in the USA. ... Its still a beautiful book. Amazon should have made it clear it is a wonderful Canadian Book."
1,Botanica's Roses,"I looked at the reviews and they where excellent. I bought the book and it has wonderful pictures. However, nobody mentioned that it is for Canada. It has a wonderful picture of Canada and its temperature zones . The difficulty is I live in United States of America. The book is for Canada period. Yes, it is a nice book, but it has to relate to USA, and this book does not. Each flower mentions a zone for growing, it mentions zone 9 numerous times. However, the book says on page 21 ""Zones 9-12 do not occur in Canada"" ? I tried to relate zones in my Great Western Book to the temperatures of the Canadian zones. Zone 1 in Botanic is not the zone 1 in Great Western, we are comparing Apples to Oranges. Yes I like this book. If I lived in Canada it would be a must. I am very dissapointed that Amazon did not show page 21, the Canadian Termperate Zones, if they had I would never have bought it."
4,Buy this for the pictures,"One of the biggest problems with buying rose plants from reading a description in the nursery or elsewhere, is guessing exactly what your blooms will look like when they appear. The pictures in this book are lovely. What a pleasure to just browse through the pictures. (We now need a scratch a sniff version of this book, for what is a rose without a fragrance!) My BIG complaint against this book is the many inconsistencies between the main entries and the reference table. For example Tiki is described as ""fragrant"" in the main entry, and in the reference table, the fragrance amoount is given as ""none"". Big John bloom color is described as ""medium red"" in one section, and ""pink blend"" in another.A beautiful and useful book nonetheless. I would still go out and buy it if I didn't already have it."
2,I've had it a year or two now...,"I like this coffee pot. I don't think I could say the same if it weren't for my husband.When I bought it, the coffee spurted up and out of the lid even when the lid was closed. My husband put a bolt or something to redirect the coffee down.Water escaped through the steam valve. My husband put a seal around the edge of the valve.Lastly, it will overflow if you fill the bottom with water. You have to be careful about the water level. Fill it to just below the pressure/steam release.Mostly I use my older pot (not this one) because of the overflow issue. Just pay attention and it won't happen."
1,A Poor Quality Product,"This product looks handsome enough, but looks can be very deceiving! The rim of the spout had some vicious burrs which could have caused a nasty laceration. I worked on it with emery paper to correct that issue. The gasket did not seal, no matter how much torque I applied. Fortunately I had a spare Bialetti brand gasket for a 6 cup stainless pot which fitted perfectly and solved that issue. The funnel of this so-called 10 cup unit has exactly the same capacity as my Bialetti Class 6 cup pot. The resulting brew was decent enough, but weaker than it should have been. Then corrosion spots appeared on the inside of the lower boiler. I finally solved all issues by buying a 10 cup Bialetti Musa. What a difference! I wish I hadn't been such a cheapskate and had just bought the 10 cup Bialetti in the first place! The Villaware Aramatico is now just a pretty decoration in my pantry."
4,A new perspective,"One of the best cover albums I've ever heard. Most of the songs are done in country-rock style, and even the Monkees covers are given a slightly country feel. I wasn't sure if I'd like anybody covering some of my favorite Monkees songs, but I found most of them to be just as good as the originals. The best of these are ""You Told Me"", ""The Girl I Knew Somewhere"" and ""St. Matthew"". As for the covers of Michael's solo songs, ""Joanne"" and ""Texas Morning"" are terrific. Overall, a really great album."
5,Great Music,This is the very enjoyable music for those who loves Dance music. I wish they put some music samples of this group. Highly recommended.
2,JAST WHAT YOU NEED FOR A GOOD PARTY,"This is a very good music, one of the my best collections,I'm a jazzmen, trust me. I also have a full collections of SUPERMAX."
2,EUDORA WELTY DESERVES MUCH BETTER,"This book was a great disappointment. It was often downright boring and a chore to complete...the author has done an injustice to Ms. Welty and her fine work. It is obvious the author was so enraptured by her subject that she missed entirely the intrique human being inside. Again, a great disappointment."
2,You get what you pay for.,"It's worth the extra money to get the higher quality levelers. Stay away from these! The fake screw is just a press-in ""rivet"" that does almost nothing to keep the nylon base and pressed steel cap attached to the post. I ordered 16 of these, and 5 have fallen apart just in the box. I expected lower quality at this price, but the fact that the rivet has a fake screw head is just salt in the poorly fitting wound."
1,Warning! do not say I didn't tell you,"I was encouraged to buy this DVD after reading the available reviews, but what a waste!! I think their songs are great, but what a waste for a DVD, I would rather listen to them on a Cd. The sound is not even 5.1 channel, it is not remastered and the video quality is poor, worse if you watch it on a Digital T.V. (cause the image errors get increased on a digital monitor). If you really love great sound and otsatnding image quality, look for Eagles-Hell Freezes Over, The Music from Monstserrat live, Roy Orbison, or Bee-Gees (one night only) There are better DVDs. Only if you are a fan and no matter what you get you want to own it, buy it.... but don't say I didn't tell you."
2,Poor quality production,"There is a humming sound throughout the entire show. This must be a problem with all the Musikladen videos. Otherwise, the show would have been great."
1,"The Macrobiotic Way"" l","I returned the book ""The Macrobiotic Way"" last month and have not heard anything from the suppler one way or the other.Can you please help me with this?Thanks,Carolee Mattox"
2,Not what it appears,"Having a keen interest in the subject matter this book purportedly covers, that of piloting on the Delaware Bay and River, I was very disappointed to find the discussion of piloting is only a sidebar to the book's main theme. If I was interested in reading about Quakers and their objection to war, or the love triangle that ensues, I would have rated this book much higher. Although fiction, I was expecting this book to cover in much greater detail what it took to become a pilot at the turn of the century and would have found this highly interesting. To the contrary, the reader is left with little more knowledge of this area at the end of the book as he was at the beginning. This is a prime example of the saying, 'You can't tell a book by its cover'."
5,Just Brilliant,"we got the ""Farewell"" digipack today, and we've just finished listening toit.We're shocked by its fresh imposing beauty and extreme originality, thesound quality and variety is amazing, we can't describe our feelings aboutthe intertwining electronic sequences, it's like swimming in an ocean ofcrystal clear frequencies, we're deeply impressed. Everything's so elegantand well balanced, the graphic layout too.This is their best album ever , no doubt about it."
1,Ugh!,"So I see the Clan has joined the ranks of all these horrible Synth-Pop wanna-be Goth bands out there. It's too bad that people in the scene are so into that stuff. It has completely destroyed the Goth scene forever.What ever happened to Gothic Music? When did it turn from something cool to something so lame and predictible. Where's the creativity? All these bands sound alike now. We used to have goth bands with different sounds within the genre, now all the clubs play this synth-pop stuff which has absolutely and utterly no relationship with what Goth started out as.I'm sorry but since I have taste and a sense of history I just can't listen to this drivel.Lame - boring - repetitive - soulless music"
1,Sold out!!,"After all these years i never thought Ronny would sell out just to make a buck.If you are a fan of Xymox's older stuff you won't like this album.It is nothing like their previous work,they went totally synthpop,hence the word sell out.Total disapointment."
4,These guys sound like Creedence!,"The 22-20s are another rock sensation from the UK. Discovered them at a festival called ""Londen Calling"" at the Paradiso in Amsterdam.(where I also saw The Strokes, Kings of Leon, The Darkness, The Bravery, Bloc Party, Kaiser Chiefs before all of these bands scoredit bigtime). I thought they really sounded like Creedence Clearwater Revival, they got that 70s feel just right. Catchy riffs and a Great sounding organ. Standout tracks are ""Devil in me"", ""Just a fool"" and ""the thing that lovers do"". It has some weak moments (friends is kind of a filler track), but its pretty good for a debut, I think this band will grow, so I await their next release."
3,is a name all that counts,"I fail to see what is bluesy about these guys except their name, they sound like any other english band. I gave the album a three and its not bad but its about a mile from anything blues related. get North Mississippi Allstars ""Hill Country Revue"" its what taking blues and making it into somthing modern really is."
3,Good. Room to grow,These guys DO have a handle on the rock. Their ability to bring the rock shouldn't be questioned.
5,Great service!,"We had some issues at first. When I received the book, the cover was correct, but the actual book itself was an entirely different book! So, I went through the return process and a replacement (the correct one this time) was sent to me and I received it 2 days later! Might sound like a bad review, but it really isn't! They replied so quickly and I now have my gift in plenty of time for Christmas!! :)"
5,Don't think this book is out dated!,"It is now 2010. Starting in January of 2011 we will be study this book at our Tuesday morning women's bible study. This will be the fourth time I've led &/or done this study over the years and it doesn't get old. Judith Coachman wrote this book before The Purpose Driven Life (PDL), which was a life changing book for many. However, as I say to others about this book, this is PDL on steroids. If you really want to see what scripture has to say about your significance and your purpose in life this is a well ground, full of rich scripture references and beautiful writing resource for you to discover God's plan for your life. Check it out for yourself."
1,Bury this deep,It is hard to believe that Brigitte Aubert could have sunk from her previous high (in Death from the Woods) to the appalling low of this offering.The self-indulgent opening pages of Death from the Woods provide an ominous warning of what is to come. Seldom do I fail to complete a book - particularly one I have obtained as a hardback - but this one joins the list. Aubert's work deserves to be buried under a deep avalache.
1,A big disappointment,"I can't remember when I've been so disappointed in a book. Ms. Auberg's previous book, Death From the Woods, was unusual, with an intriguing heroine in Elise Andrioli, a blind, mute quadriplegic. It was an excellent, suspenceful and believable mystery--which is more than can be said for this book. Throughout Death From the Snow, rather than helping to solve the mystery, Elise simply goes from one improbable incident to another, without a clue. And the denouement was even more implausible than the rest."
2,If your looking for another Vital Signs you won't find it here.,"To much guitar, drowns out all the other instruments. Survivor was made famous by heavy keyboards and drums, not guitars. I was expecting another Burning Heart, Is this Love, High on you. No songs on this albums have that sound. The vocals by Jamison are top notch, but none of the songs sound like the Survivor I remember. Survivor guitars were only there to complement the keyboards, bass and drums, not drive the whole song. I guess Jim Peterik was the man behind Survivor all along. I give the CD 2 stars for Fire makes Steel, the rest are throw aways. ***Recommended for die hards only*** I highly recommend 'When Seconds Count' for anyone getting started with Survivor."
2,Over-produced and kinda bland with it,"Listening to this album I found too many layers of tracking and it's kind of like latter-day Journey, but without Neil Shorn (spelling?) guitar work to make up for it.It's over-produced and over-mixed, so all the songs sound the same. For me, disappointing."
4,The Ultimate Survivor,"Finally, the ultimate Survivor! As a long time Survivor fan, I have been waiting for this CD for a loooonng time! The reason I see this as the ultimate Survivor is they finally unleashed Frankie Sullivan and allow him to rock again, AND they have Jimi Jamison on vocals. So, this CD is more along the lines of the original, REAL Survivor. [Sorry, K.M. Morris] We are talking more along the lines of Premonition, Eye Of The Tiger, Caught In The Game. Not the uber-pop oriented Vital Signs and When Seconds Count albums.I saw Survivor open up for Kansas in Aug of 1982, and they rocked! I mean rocked! (Eye Of The Tiger was @ #1 on the charts). Frankie Sullivan was most impressive live. It is nice to see him back in his old rocking form again! I attribute this to the absence of Peterik. Just like when Steve Perry left Journey, Neal Schon was allowed to turn it up again. Same scenario here.If you like the older Survivor, more guitar, less keyboards, this is a must have."
3,Fun for awhile,"This production is probably a little long and does not live up to its advertised funny bloopers. It is still a fun DVD for the very young toy train enthusiast and is still enjoyed by them. However, its a little hard for the adult to get through and tends to ""lose"" the focus of the very young enthusiast due to repeated actions throughout the presentation and the length."
5,Another must have!,This is another great for the 'I Love Toy Trains' series. Has really funny out-takes that even my 4 years old son laughs at! Another must have! They really understand what makes kids happy!
4,Oh No! grows on you.,"My kids and their friends all loving watching this dvd. Their ages range from 2 - 12. The first time my oldest son, who is 7, sat through the dvd he was disappointed because he thought it was going to be really funny. After watching it the second time, and many times since then, he has grown to love it and sings the songs randomly in the car with his buddies."
5,Perfection,"This is a wonderful product. In fact, it's my favorite bath soap and I buy it regularly. It has a wonderful fragrance and the soap lasts a long time."
3,Useful not only for historical purposes,"Pothier wrote before ""legal science"" became de rigeur on the Continent. Hence his treatise is of some value to Common Law attorneys studying the contract law in the Civil Law tradition, since his approach is more easily digestible than otherwise would be the case."
3,sounds great.... BUT,"don't get me wrong. i'm not hatin. however, please leave out the diva singers. if i wanted to hear that club-friendly poppish crap i would go to a gay club and listen to whitney houston house remixes while getting stared down by freakishly strange transvestites. i expect the contrary when i want my drum & bass sounds and i tend to agree heavily with the previous reviewer. HOWEVER, the mix between trak 4's ""bizarre"" by illformats and track 5's ""now is the time"" by dj abstract is the BADDEST mix i've ever heard in my life (no joke mofo). jeez.. its like the longest mix between 2 records i've ever heard in my life. so i'm not hatin. its an awesome cd. but i would still recommend resonance over this one. and yes! this is definately drum & bass... don't listen to those tech-step loving naysayers. its just alittle more friendly than all the purist are used too."
2,are you serious?,"This album does not deserve 5 stars. It seriously lacks......DRUM AND BASS. 5 out of 16 tracks actually fit the genre. The other songs are nothing more than pure dark, twisted, hardcore TECHNO. I would never recommend this cd to another American in hopes they might expand their narrow-minded opinions about music. It has no cross-over appeal, unless of course you like the Pop-club progressive house you hear on your local radio stations. Drum and Bass Cd's should come hard or not at all. Drum and Bass, Thump and Kick. You should feel it hit your chest, consequently causing you to move your feet. It should not inspire you to twirl lights in a frenzy. Do not misunderstand me, the cd is not terrible.....it's just not Drum n' Bass. Check Out Bad Company, Adam F, and/or Dillinja/Lemon D if you wanna hear real DnB."
5,Saved our wedding,"This book really helped save our wedding. We were running around like crazy trying to get everything done, however, once we read the book we had a much better understanding of how to plan our wedding. We calmed down, picked up and finished planning based on ideas from the book. It felt like 100 tons was lifted from us as we easily finished our wedding plans and had the time of our life doing it.Since we had a Jewish wedding, this book is much more helpful and better written then the other two books we were using which included information that didn't really give us any jewish traditional ideas while planning."
3,"Some practical help, but look elsewhere for tradition","No doubt some of the discussion of planning finances and choosing helpers could be helpful, and helpful to any bride-to-be of any religion.But please get the Diamant book and/or Lamm's ""The Jewish Way in Love & Marriage"" if you want to know about meanings behind Jewish wedding traditions. For example, in LBR's suggested wedding music playlist, ""Here comes the Bride"" is listed, with ""Traditional"" as the composer, as an option for announcing the bride and groom. This is a Wagner composition, and some rabbis will decline to perform a wedding with music by that extreme hater!No doubt I run in very different social circles than the author, but all that means is different books for different folks. Don't take this book as the final guide to Yiddish or Hebrew terms, but if the other reviews sound like what you need, go for it."
3,"For Inquiring ""New Investigators"" to ""Seasoned Pros""","What this version lacks is poster-sized illustrations...other than that, you'll find it here. While much time is spent on in-depth detail of information and explanation ranging from historical context and relevance, to the present day continuation of many of the ancient beliefs/practices, the inquiring reader won't have to worry about ""treading water"" here due to the well-defined, logical layout of the work. Rather than bounce from here to there and back again, the read and ""look"" is more like an entertaining, well-mapped history book; great lay out, fun, and informative. ;)"
1,did not work,"They sent me first one, and then another, and neither of them worked. In the end, I got a refund. The company had no explanation for the problem."
2,Not so much,"I was willing to pay the price based on the rave reviews, the travel-friendly collapsible design, the flat base (so you can also use it as a bedside lamp while rummaging in the dark) and the spine clip, but the gooseneck was not long enough for the light to cover all of both pages of even a normally small paperback, and the light was not bright enough to compensate - and I generally use these lights in very dark bedroom situations, not in low-light situations like evening train rides where it might do fine. After trying 5 different lights of varying manufacturers, designs and prices, I ended up going with the $12 version of the Mighty Bright LED light. I'd rather have the spine clip than the cover clip, but my 48 year old eyes need the extra brightness that none of the spine clip LED versions seemed to be able to achieve. It's hard to believe this is such rocket science. IF Zelco added an inch to this light and made it brighter, it'd be worth any price they named!"
1,keep looking,The good : It is light & small.The clip works well allowing for easy page turning.The Bad : The goose-neck is too short. Thus the top of the page is well-lighted while the lower half of the page is dark/dim. No amount of manipulation of the goose neck will help.The on/off switch is a plastic covered push toggle. It tkes an average of 3-4 tries to get it to come/stay on. Annoying !Summary : Don't buy it ! There must be better ones out there
5,Best. Book light. Ever.,Ok so it's a book light. But it's awesome. Feel free to do so yourself but I've researched it and it doesn't get better than this.The long lasting (and bright) led light and neck slides back into the body for storage... It includes a case! It's all sleek aluminium looking and it purposely lights both pages when you're reading. Just well designed.Comes in a great package. Love it. I've bought 3 as gifts and then finally 1 for myself.
3,Clever and nifty: if only it were a little brighter it'd be perfect,"I love the design of this light. It's incredibly pleasing to use because it's so slim and nifty. I like the way it packs away in its own little case. You use it by sliding it down the spine of the book. It took me a couple of gos to get the hang of that, but it actually works very well.My one criticism is that I wish the light was a little brighter. Reading a hardback or larger paperback, the light is just a little dim on the edges of the page. I found it tiring to use it for more than about 15-20 minutes. My husband is not disturbed by the light but prefers to sleep facing away from me when I use it, as it's quite bright if he's facing me and inadvertently opens his eyes.It's not the perfect reading light and probably doesn't justify the price - but I love the design so much that I feel quite attached to it regardless."
1,itty bitty doesn't work,I was really excited about getting this book light. My daughter bought this for me as a gift and I was only able to use it a couple of time before it quit working altogether. I have not been able to get it working again. I would not recommend this light and I would suggest you keep looking.
1,"design flawed, production poor","I am moved to write my first Amazon review ever due to my disappointment with this product. This light looks nice, but I agree with other customers who said the gooseneck is way too short and the light too dim. In addition, my light's head was installed so that the bulbs pointed away from the text, and no amount of twisting would get them to stay pointed down.I've tried just about every book light. Will keep looking.Zelco 11214 itty bitty Slim LED Booklight"
1,"fell apart immediately, total junk",tried to install batteries for first use and battery latch and switch fell to pieces in my hand. complete piece of junk. don't waste your money...
4,"Excellent, with a catch...","I've purchased a few of these based on a very thorough review of book lights on slate.com. Have used it happily and prefer it to other, bulkier book lights. I especially like the fact that it is so streamlined - easy to pack to take on a trip. Two downsides: 1) it's true, as another reviewer suggests, that if you're reading a larger hardback book it can be tricky to coax the bendable neck to illuminate the entire page. Not a dealbreaker, though. 2) is a bit more of an issue - when putting the light away recently, I pushed the rectractable neck a bit too snugly into its casing and can't pull it back out. Seems to be a design flaw. Of course, if you want the perfect book light, get a Kindle with the cover that has one built in - awesome!"
3,good potential,"This is a great book light. Lasts a long time on the batteries. I put lithium AA in and it lasted months with some usage most days. Nice and bright - but not to bright to wake up someone sleeping. I'm not giving it 5 stars because the battery door busted and doesn't work at all now. It's a pricey light to have such a huge weakness and die so soon.Pros: Good brightness. Works great on books.Cons: Battery cover on bottom is flimsy, and tricky - completely broke the second time I changed the batteries. Won't attach to e-reader."
1,You'd think it would last longer for that price.,"I shelled out $30 for this thing in the expectation that it would last longer than the $12 versions you can get everywhere. Wrong. The wiring in these things must inherently suck, because after a month or two, the LED's started shorting out and dimming just like the cheap ones."
5,Love Love Love,"I LOVE Dr. Bronners Peppermint Lip Balm. When you apply it, it is so silky smooth and makes your lips tingle. I LOVE the tingle! I keep several of these around so I can have easy access to it no mater where I am. In my car, in my bag, in the dinning room, in the living room. They are stashed every where! Nothing else compares."
1,Do not buy this lip balm!,"Do not waste your money on this lip balm! It came in a pack of 6 - it has the most HORRID smell, and putrid color. It is so disgusting, there is no way I would put it on my lips.It wasn't just me! Since I had 6 of them, I gave them to friends for them to check out - they agree with me - THIS STUFF IS TERRIBLE - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
5,DO buy this!,"Please do not let that other review discourage you from buying this lip balm. I have been using it for a year now, and its great. It always leaves my lips moisturized. The smell is NATURAL, because the ingredients are natural and there is no added scent. That other person who left the review must not use very many natural products. Susie said ""it has the most HORRID smell, and putrid color."" What does the color have to do with anything? The color is natural, too, just like any oil. I don't even know how a color can be ""putrid"". If you are not used to natural products, I would say try the peppermint from the same brand. I like the naked for when I'm at home and at night, and the peppermint for when I'm out. Please just don't be discouraged from buying this brand because of one person's review. See for yourself if you like it! I have been battling dry lips my whole life and this is the only brand I have found that works for ME, 100% of the time."
4,Pray With Fire,"Pray With Fire taught me more about God than any other book I have read besides the Bible. Learning to listen to the Spirit and have Him teach me how to pray has made a world of difference in my prayer life. I used to tell God what He ought to do in my prayers; now I'm trying to discern what it is He is purposing, and when. I would fully recommend this book to anyone who is serious about wanting to learn how to pray and intercede in this season of revival."
5,3rd Wave What?!?!??,"This is what ""3rd Wave Ska"" should have really been about; good music, lyrics you can relate to, and sexy female mankillers. Great independent CD for those who are hip to quality."
4,Best of the Elizabeth MacPherson series,"I've read 4 or 5 of the Elizabeth MacPherson mysteries and this one is my favorite. All are humorous, light mysteries great for the beach or in-flight entertainment. As a fan of all things Scottish, I especially enjoyed the author's version of the scottish games and her presentation of an actual Scot being the most un-Scottish person there. Very amusing!"
4,Easy to use,I found out recently that I have type 2 diabetes. With a meal plan from my nutritionist and this book I am able to make meals that are good tasting and fairly quick to fix. The break down of serving sizes and exchanges has helped me plan meals that are interesting and stay within my exchanges. My only problem is the use of mainly processed foods in many recipes. I would like to find a book using more fresh ingredients.
4,My husband loves everything I've cooked from this book!,"The recipes are for ""normal"" food (as opposed to the kind of cookbooks that offer extreme ingredients that you must move to Manhattan to aquire!). He has loved every single thing I've prepared using recipes in this book. Lots of variety, great nutritional info, and easy preparation. He's a Type I diabetic, and has been for over 40 years. Before I started cooking for him when we married 4 years ago, he had no idea food that's good for him could be GOOD, too! And, this cookbook was one of the first I used to prepare new recipes for him that didn't require modifications to keep his blood glucose in control."
2,It's o.k.,"O.K. but better books out there. I was really wanting a true recipe book, instead it is a combination of diabetic learning and a few recipes."
2,Everything about Elton but......... music,"After having read the entire 500+/- page book I have to appreciate that Mr. Norman is a serious fan of Elton. The book is well researched. If you want to know what color outfit he wore at a particular gig you're probably in luck. If you want to know about Elton and his songwriting/music this is probably not the book for you. So many of Elton classic albums are just brushed off or hardly mentioned. Really. If you're lucky you may get a tracklisting; other albums not even that. While the private lives of musicians can be interesting to a point please don't forget what made them famous in the first place. There is little to no mention of the recordings of several albums (what was the mood, who was there, what inspired the song)."
2,Elton John,Book arrived very fast by the USPS and was in great condition. Tried to read it but it was as dry as dust. Left it in the break room for someone else to choke on!
5,Sir Elton: The Definitive Biography - Phillip Norman,"I've received this book on October 17th, 2011 and now is the 25th.I'm still at page 148 but I'm already amazed by the richness of details about the pernol and the artist lives Mr. Norman took me to learn so far.I'm from Brazil and an Elton fan since 1972. I tell you I thought I knew a lot bout him but I'm getting to know we never know nothing in such deepness until someone researches and publishes on a biography like that.I'm pretty sure this book will get me in awe when I finish it.Praise, Mr. Norman for teaching the writers how to make a real biography."
3,You get what you pay for.,"This thing works, but not well. It does not do a great job of chopping up ingredients (such as nuts and berries). But it mixes okay. I've used better immersion blenders (Braun, for example), but I guess for under ten bucks, you get what you pay for."
5,Delightful,"As a youth services librarian, this is the kind of book I'd classify as the perfect storytime book. Publishers take note: we want larger pictures, with warm, vivid illustrations. It also helps that this book uses repetition, sequencing, concepts like left and right--all great early literacy skills we want to share with our preschoolers. Besides--this is a fun, silly, suspenseful book. Check it out!"
3,Not long wearing....,"Bought these a few years ago and loved them...so did everyone who saw them. They are stylish, comfy and easy to slip on an off. Alas, the sole does not hold up and neither does the heel area. The bottom of the shoe just sort of fell apart while the rest is still quite attractive. Not a good buy!"
3,"Works, but somewhat disappointing","I purchased this flashlight because I have had good luck with Gerber products in the past and I was looking for a small sturdy light to keep in my pocket while hiking. The light is definitely small and sturdy, but suffers from two design flaws: color output and on off mechanism. As with some other white LED flashlights I've used, the light produced by this product has a definite bluish tinge which I find unpleasant. Perhaps a worse problem is the mechanism employed to turn the light on and off - screwing the bottom cap all the way on turns on the light. To turn it off, you have to unscrew the cap a bit and listen to the sound of the spring scraping on the AAA battery inside. This works, but it makes me afraid that the light will accidentally get turned on in my pocket and run the battery down hence defeating the purpose of having the light in the first place. In summary, the light is okay but I probably wouldn't buy it again or recommend it to other people."
3,"100,000 Hrs??","I rely on flashlights for I have lived without electricity for 20 years in my cabin in rural,Haines, Alaska. I own 3 of these convenientlysmall, single AAA battery Gerber LED lights.One of which I carry everyday on a neck lanyard.Two have them have gone belly up in two years.The third sometimes doesn't turn on unless I tapit. The green coating has rubbed off but that isno big deal. I'm just surprised that the ""100,000 hours"" LED's have only lasted a fraction of thattime.The small size and brightness are the strongpoints."
4,Pretty Good,"Had it for awhile now and used it a couple of times, it does the job and makes my knife razor sharp. No complaints about it so far, so I would recommend it with the addition of the DMT Diamon fine to get the best edge."
2,poor condition,"if the seller states that book was in fair condition yes to look at it pages were intact, writing not stainedBut clearly this book was in a flood.when i opened the package to read the book i could barley breath the smell was so bad i could not stand to have it out and around mehad to put it in a plastic bag and tie it uplooked up what i could do to fix smell, spray with Lysol and leave in the sunthanks for the allergy flair upGlenda"
2,"If you were disappointed before, you will be again.","I began to have high, romantic hopes from book 1, The Book of Earth, but they were dashed by this last book. If you are hoping that this book will have a satisfying ending, think again.In her typical style, Marjorie B. Kellogg builds up what the reader believes to be a satisfying conclusion of events, but then dashes our hopes in the last moments. This book is a painful anxiety-creating experience.The author takes the easy way out in ending her most villainous characters. The confrontations between good and evil that the reader comes to expect never happen, leaving the reader (at least in my case) feeling cheated and as though the author gave up in the end. I feel that she chose the easy way out and wasted her time creating dynamic characters, only to dash our hopes of a good read in the end.I wasted my time on this entire series, and I do not recommend this novel to anyone with romantic notions, nor hopes for the futures of the characters!"
5,Great value!,"I play for a small church with no other musicians. With this keyboard I can add drums, bass and strings automatically. It also has intros and endings that work very nicely. Lots of variety and things I haven't even tried yet. I LOVE this little keyboard. Light and easy to carry. I highly recommend it for players that tend to play a lot of accompaniment chords instead of all melody."
5,Absolutely love it (can't wait to learn all the functions),"I'm an experienced guitar player and a beginner on the keyboard. Can't wait to learn the advanced functions on this thing, but it looks beautiful and sounds great. Not quite the build quality required for gigging (which you might find in a $1,000 keyboard) because it's made out of lightweight plastic, but it has a million different options that you can get creative with."
5,Great Heads,I put these on my Tama Superstar set and they did not disappoint. I switched to these from Evans EC2's and wont be going back. They have better sustain and have a better attack than the EC2's.
4,Books,The American Girl boxed set came in the amount of time promised and was in great condition. The price and shipping were both very reasonable. Will definately purchase more in the future
3,2 of the same book!,"I bought this set as a gift for my niece for Christmas. I loved American Girl books when I was little, and she is at the age where I'm sure she will love these books too. I was happy with the price and speed of shipping and everything, except when I got my package and looked closer at the numbers of the books, there were 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4. I checked the title and sure enough two of one of the titles. I don't know if it was a fluke or what, but instead of going through the hassle of returning (and possibly having the same thing happen) I'm going to see if I can find just book six at a book store or something and just replace it in the set. Still frustrating though!"
1,don't need it,"YOU DON'T NEED THIS BOOK. I GOT JIGGLYPUFF, CAPTAIN FALCON, LUIGI, NESS, AND MUSHROOM ISLAND BEFORE I EVER HAD THIS BOOK."
5,"This bunk bed is elegant, solid and compact","I ordered this bunk bed and I am very happy with it. It is solid pink wood, very good smooth finish, compact. My kids just love it. I strongly recommend this to anybody. I like the color and easy to assemble."
5,Voyaging on a small income,"All though this has been written quiet a while ago and therefore dated, I found this enjoyable to read as some of the places mentioned I have visited and must say they have not changed all that much. . . Glasson Dock for one. Badger seamed like a cramped boat but a well love boat. Definitely one that will make you sit up and think."
4,Did Van She rip-off Andre Cymone for KELLY?,"I love the icy, cool electro-pop-rock sound of Van She, but I just went back and heard ANDRE CYMONE's debut LP and heard Cymone's own KELLY'S EYES - which sports the exact same synth line and vocal hook and title as Van Shes' KELLY? Coincidence or thinly veiled rip-off? You decide."
5,Fair Tax the best way to fund government,"The most important thing about the Fair Tax - EVERYONE would know EVERYTIME they paid their income tax. The sneaky way the government is funded now - through witholding taxes - keeps people from knowing how much they pay in income tax. In fact, most people think they don't pay income tax when they get their refund!If there were a national sales tax, then every time someone purchased something, they would see right there on the sales slip, how much they paid to fund the government.The wealthy would pay MORE tax, just as most people want. Why? Because they buy more. And the things they buy cost more.Saving would be encouraged. Much red tape would be eliminated. No one would pay tax on necessities.There is no down side to the Fair Tax."
2,Why did they bother?,"The books are witty and charming. This, in stark contrast, is formulaic schlock. Americans -- and much of the world's consumers -- prefer their entertainment predigested so it doesn't require chewing, so they consume the same nutritionless movieland cliches endlessly.In the land of limitless equality, everything is reduced to equal tastelessness. If you want impart the capacity for discernment to your child, you could start by avoiding this twaddle. The Eloise books are special, while this movie is mere product.Update: I've since discovered that Anchor Bay has two Eloise animated DVDs, ""Me, Eloise,"" and ""Little Miss Christmas,"" which are far more tolerable than this Disney garbage. They are at least a bit more faithful to the spirit of the books."
1,Eloise,"Disappointing story of little rich girlwho lives at the Plaza Hotel. Eloise isthe I Do As I Please girl who never listensto her nanny, her teacher or to hotel rules.Eloise should go to a military school. JulieAndrews as the nanny seems to be half asleepin this production."
1,Why Bother?,"Eloise movies are so the opposite of ""heart-warming"".what kind of sick people want to make movies about little brats that learn life lessons, or stay at the plaza hotel? BORING! Just don't watch it, that was my mistake. at least i didn't buy it, i watched it on tv. But don't even do that. it's a waste of two hours in your life that you'll never get back. these movies are so bad that they don't even deserve 1 star! i feel sorry for you if you think otherwise."
5,remember when you were six?,"One night I was absentmindedly channel surfing and came upon Eloise at Christmastime on ABC. I'd heard of the books growing up, but never read one myself for whatever reason. After watching just two minutes of this movie, I was sucked in for the next two hours. I'm eighteen, done highschool and moving on in life but OH how Eloise fills you up with that childhood inspiration. Where the world is your playground, everything is possible, there is never a dark cloud. The next day I purchased Eloise at the Plaza and rushed home to watch it and, not surprisingly, fell in love. The actress cast as Eloise is irresistably cute and with all honesty, I could watch this movie and this movie alone every night for the rest of my life. Buy it for your children, or watch it on a rainy day."
5,Great movie!,I purchases this DVD for my mother for Mother's Day. It arrived and we were treated again to a funny little girl seemingly 'on her own'. We thoroughly enjoyed her shenanigans and would recommend it to anyone for a good family night film.
5,Enchanting Eloise,"Eloise at the PlazaSix year old Eloise moves from storybook to video in tis enchanting tale. Eloise lives at the Plaza hotel with her Nanny and pets. Like every child, she is full of energy.The premise of the story is that the Plaza is hosting the Debutante Ball with Eloise eagerly waiting for her invitation. Her date, she is sure, is the Prince.Along the way, she meets and befriends Leon, who joins her on her search for the Prince and has a secret of his own. Together they explore New York while the adults prepare for the Prince's stay at the Plaza.This movie will hold you spellbound from beginning to end."
3,Chew Toy,"It was a nice toy but, not really made for Jack Russell's. But, then again not much is. My dogs had it for about a week and then the stuffing was all over my living room. But, at the same time I also got them a Tough Kong Wubba and they shredded the tough canvis and chewed through the rubber kong. So, maybe it is just not made for dogs who like to chew. But, it would be perfect for dogs who just like to play without the chewing!"
1,Why Sam....why.,"My disgust for the cover of this album is beyond belief. Why in the name of God was this made the cd cover? I'm sure they must've had other ideas they sorted through before they reached a final decision. It's baffling to think that they settled on this one. The exact same goes for the title of this album....why. The music here pretty much coincides with the cover and title of the album. I love Quasi, and thoroughly enjoyed albums such as 'Field Studies' and 'featuring: Birds', but this album just falls short. It's just not fun to listen to, and the lyrics aren't what they used to be. For the avid quasi fan this will be the biggest disappointment you will ever have."
1,Whiney college rock,"I liked Quasi better when they kept their noses out of politics.This album, aloof left-wing politics aside, just leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. Sam Coomes and Janet Weiss aren't intellectuals when it comes politics. Next time, if they'd leave their socialist leanings out of the music and add a few catchy hooks instead, they *might* renew my interest in them.Buy ""Field Studies"" or ""featuring 'Birds'"" instead."
1,"Tuneless, listless, vitriolic nonsense","""Bombs fall like rain,"" whines Sam Coomes in the aloof ""White Devil's Dream"". Of course, as Coomes ""eloquently"" puts it, the ""White Devil"" is the eviiil, WHITE, conservative G.W. Bush.We can't have a nasty, racist Republican liberate the opressed people of Iraq from a tin-horn dictator, can we??? So says, Coomes/Weiss.Amazingly enough, Coomes and Weiss never spew this same bilge at Bill Clinton when he lobbed bombs over at Iraq in 1998. They just turned a blind eye. Ah, the hypocrisy and double standards.Quasi should've removed the ""Hot"" from the title of their album.It would've made the title more apt."
5,Exit Grissom,"It is very hard to get used to a character who's made the show over the years. Grissom will never be replaced, anymore than Sean Connery as 007. But, it was good while it lasted. Many thanks Mr. William Petersen for a great performance as Gil Grissom."
5,Great Season!,"Some of these reviews are droll, asking for the show to be cancelled or saying it is nothing with Grissom, well that's just not the case!Peterson's quirky character shall be missed, but Fishburne's somewhat naive yet attentive character is a pleasure to watch. Catherine, Nick, and Greg still remain on the team, each of them doing what they do best and the actors shine as usual. The lab techs are recieving more airtime and Hodges becomes an ever more present character (much to my enjoyment).The storylines are as interesting as ever (there are quite a few dramatic and emotion-heavy storylines as well), always keep you guessing, and a lot suprises!I have to say, if you are a true fan of CSI, meaning you watch for the show and not the popularity, this season is excellent, a definate buy.I have been a CSI fan since the beginning and have no intention to stop watching anytime soon."
4,CSI Season Evaluation,"I liked it because I'm a teacher and I use to show this type of projections as an assessment technique. Since I'm now in an unit called Mystery, I think this series should be very helpful."
4,A great show,"The only problem is the inside of the case the holders for the disc where broken, they weren't damaged. It's just that the holders where broken off the case."
4,CSI Season 9,"I wasn't sure about CSI with Grissom, but them seem to have handled the transition seamlessly. Yet another great season for the original, and the best, CSI."
4,CSI young man with a horn,I really enjoy this show it's fun to watch I like when their then case connects with an old vegas case.
5,Another great one from Mama Silver...,"Alot of people dont like Mama Silver in any way. I do. I also appreciate these books for teens. Bethany, Tillie, Nam, and Sidney get caught up in the hauntings of an Orchard outside of town. Little do they know there is a practicing murderer stalking them and threatening their life."
5,enjoyable songs,wonderful songs! specialy when you take long trips in the car. They make the trip very enjoyable. You can sing along because they come with the words in a cute booklet.
3,Not what I was looking for,"I was disappointed when I received my book. The first time I needed to use it I had to buy a NIC and NOC book in order to understand their NIC and NOC references. This book would be good for a practitioner with a good knowledge of the interventions and the outcomes. If you are a student, as I am save your money now and go ahead and buy the NIC and NOC, and not this book, because I found I could not use it at all."
1,Dangerous for inquisitive finches!,"One of my zebra finches got himself trapped upside-down in this holder after climbing in from the top, trying to get at some leftover millet inside. He wedged himself so far in that he had trouble breathing and couldn't get himself out. I had to cut the holder apart to get him out. Since finches can die if they can't get to food during the day, this is a dangerous holder to leave in a cage unsupervised!Get a smaller one if you have finches. Or better yet, just clip the millet to the side of the cage.Jonathan"
2,Millett Holder,"Very cheap plastic. Too small to hold a large spray. My bird was, however, was not able to chew throught the plastic."
5,What it says!!!,What better review can one give than to say this book delivers what it says. The methods are straight forward and simple and they do help those who can't draw a straight line. Most art books are written for a visual-learning person and a person who learned to draw as a kid--this book isn't! Although I often overanalyze things this books actually got me drawing in a painless way. I may not become a professional artist but I now have an enjoyable new skill.
5,Cool game,"OMG!1!!!1 this was like 1 one of the best racing game i have ever played! I wish more games like this one existed! We need more games like this , and i know everyone will agrey with me when i say this game rocks"
4,A Pleasure,Finally a high quality approachable driving game.Pick up and play with tons of customization options including a solid variety of venues.This is a great game whether you are a casual gamer or a driving game nut it definetely cures the itch at a great price.
3,Good filter but design needs work,"I've had this for a week, and it does it's job well - but one of my Tetras was sucked against the side of the pipe and died."
3,Reliable but have a few flaws.,I have been using these whisper hang on back filters for over ten years because they just work.The flaws are some are noisy right out of the box and some become noisy after a few years .This has always been due to a bad or worn out impeller in my experience. They only cost $10-$15For a new impeller but $15 is what this filter costs new. I don't see why they are more than $5 its a magnet a stainless steel rod a piece of plastic and two rubber ends. Costs pennies to make.My other criticisim is the filter cartridges are too expensive and can be a bit of a mess.Over all it is a good filter the only downfall is the cost to maintain it.
4,STILL LOUD,"I have used these filters for over 25 years. Have tried others...thinking they would be quieter, but, alas, NO, they aren't.I use the 20 Gal. filter on my 10 gallon tank to keep things more clear.Only negatives: it is still a loud motor...even more amplified by the fact that my tank is in a display bookcase, but one gets used to the ambient sound.It is no worse than the motors on a Cats water fountain (since they are the same motor)...and those of you who have live bearing, small fish, such as guppies...will need to use a small hole type of cover over the bottom intake...as it can suck up the newborns, as well as African Frog eggs.All in All...it is a GOOD Filter and only got 4 stars because of noise factor....I wish they could figure out a way to dampen it down some.CAN'T beat the price at AMAZON compared to other outlets !!!"
4,Tetra Whisper 30 Power Filter,Easy set up and reliable power filter. The only thing I don't like about it; little noisy. But overall very pleased with performance.
5,Whisper Power Filter 30,"Easy to review this one... I've used other brands of aquarium filters and this one is the 'BEST'. Quite frankly, it does the job better than any other I've used and is less expensive to operate as well. As an engineer myself, someone actually knew what they were doing when they designed this product."
3,Works good,Ive had this filter for a couple months now.. Its not really whisper quiet though. When I have the television / radio off I can certainly hear it. But its not so loud that I am going to buy a new filter. It works well and you can see from the movement in the water that it has some power behind it.
2,The Whisper doesn't whisper,"Bought this based on mostly positive reviews, hoping that I wasn't going to be one of the unlucky ones to end up with a dud (seemed like that did happen, quite often).I haven't returned it, as it is the only filter I have on my aquarium, but I have been thinking about it ever since we got it. It was noisy right out of the box, it was noisy after their recommended ""pick up and then drop"" tip, it was noisy after 24 hours, and it is noisy now a month later. The entire tube assembly with the impeller is somehow out of balance, leading to an incredibly annoying vibration with occasional grinding noises. I have tried packing it with bits of sponge I found in the house, which helps a bit. But overall, I cannot recommend this filter unless you're the gambling type."
5,filter,"the filter is very effective and efficient for the tank. the tank is always crystal clear and clean, just wonderful."
2,O my gosh I spent One hour and a half trying to get this to work.,"I was happy when I got this in the mail to day and that night I was on my way to setting it up just to found out that it wasn't pumping the water. I went through the troubleshooting tips 5 times and cleaning the magnet etc and still it did not work. So I kept at it and kept at it just to find out that the ""wonder tube"" had a hole in it at the top! I place some tape on it and it suck the water up and began to work as should. but every once in a while the tape loosen up allowing air to get in and causing the water not to be sucked up. GEEESH!!! I'm trying to think if I should just return the whole thing just to get my money back or keep it and just keep putting tape on it. Gosh! I wish Amazon would just send me a replacement part for it."
5,One of the greatest poets in the English language,"His voice still rings beautiful and true after five hundred years. What he has to say concerns our daily lives in this hard, competitive society as much as the intrigues of the Henrician court."
5,The authoritative work,This is the authoritative book on the subject of this the first modern English Poet - more neglected than he ought to be - out of print in Europe - Wyat survived life as a courtier/diplomat in the court of Henry 8th - a king as corrupted by power as its possible to be - a 16th C saddam Hussein - and yet produced these deeeply sensitive poems.
4,A great toy.,This is truly a quality toy. It's loaded with diecast metal content and has lots of moveable parts. Excellent construction and detail.
5,Great Fit,I bought these because of the price and also because I lost one on our last trip. I have secured them with a small cable to ensure I wont lose any more
3,They don't stay in!,These appear to be quality items but when I check them at each fill up I am constantly having to pound them back in. It's only a matter of time before they litter the highway. Think I'll just drill holes and use bolt with wingnut.
5,Beauty & The Beasts,"Jahme relates the great surge in the past 50 years in the study of primates by the great encouragement of noted anthropologist Louis Leakey inspiring Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey and Birute Galdikas and other women to live among chimps, baboons, gorillas, bonobos and orangutans, and study their daily behavior.She describes the women, their personal lives, their discoveries of primate behavior, the utility of those discoveries for the study of man. Jahme is aware that when one tries to tame a wild creature, that creature's behavior can change. It is a well written book with references to other books on similar subjects. Its general conclusion is that our primates are very close to us."
2,sorry to say. .,"if you are a madlib fan then you probably know about kankick also. teamed up with madlib on production with Oh No, and also Wildchild's album. the production was pretty solid then and had some good beats, however this album unfortunately was really lackluster. there is no scratching going on, the whole time during the album i was waiting for a tempo change, but it stayed pretty lackluster like it was missing something for most of the album. sorry kankick fans, this album was a thumbs down."
3,The Book Club Cookbook,"This is a wonderful idea. New to a book club, we will use this for our December read with a pot luck dinner...."
2,Revisionism at its worst,"As this book shows, there is no doubt that Irving is second-to-none in historical research and digging up the most unlikely of evidence that is extremely interesting and relevant.But as the recent libel trial he was involved with points out, he is also a hypocrite, an anti-semite, a Holocaust denial advocate, and an example of how the truth, under the facade of ""revisionism"", can be distorted and manipulated to further a political agenda....Even worse, many of the things he has said, all on the record in print or on tape, about the Jews, immigrants, and especially Holocaust survivors is stomach-turning. Any assertion that this man is not delusional at best, and hateful at worst is to ignore many of the things he has said outside of his books. His books, of which this is arguably the best, are interesting for what they propose--until you get a closer look at the type of man from which they are coming... see for yourself."
4,Irving behind the Lines,"I don't see what all the whining is about. Irving has outflanked the common W.W.II historians by doing just the kind of work they avoid. He has gone back to the surviving source documents and done the grunt work of reconstructing the record. The academic historians should feel embarrassed, rightly so because Irving has located some prime material. Though this volume is heavy with minute detail, and without maps which will slow the reader; it exactly describes the other side of the conflict. This is a good and ground breaking book because it gives the reader another view besides Mr. Churchill's and the lazy historians who followed him.Len Deightons history is similar."
3,Irving in jail for his opinions? Scary.,"I read the book when i heard the author was in Court for his opinions. Yesterday I read that he was convicted for 9 years in jail for his books. That sounds like a III Reich story to me. Irving went too far in some of his aseverations, like when he say that Hitler didnt know about the Holocaust. In my opinion is the task of the historians to put the story straight, not the Court. Now I have my doubts...can they put me in jail for express this?"
3,Good solid review of the war as seen from Hitler's perspective,"The book describes the war through Hitler's perspective - from behind his desk, from the Chancellery and Berchtesgaden, and from Rastenburg and Berlin. We get a great glimpse into how he felt about his generals, Himmler, Goring, and other top Nazis. The book also captures complete irritation with an air war that Goring couldn't handle. Also describe are Hitler's spot-on guesses about who was going to attack and when. This book gives you a good look at Hitler behind the scenes, just as the movie ""Downfall"" did. I found the book to be a very good read. I give it three stars because it wasn't one of those books that is truly a page turner, but it wasn't a bore at all, either. Just a general, steady good read. Definitely worth adding to your library."
4,"Not a ""Complete"" Reprint of the Original Two Volume Set",This 1990 Avon paperback is a recast of Irving's original two volume Viking Press set. It is condensed from 1032 pages to 794 pages. Page size is unchanged but font size is smaller and the alignment of the lines compressed. Missing in the Avon edition are the author's extensive notes (93 pages of interesting but supplemental material) and a five page bibliography of published literature on Hitler.
3,Different opinion,"Irving has a different opinion on this suject,but in my opinioncomes close to the truth.It is a different thing to learnhistory in the politicall correct athmosphere of a school orin a University or if you have gone through history all thelength on you own.Beeing a German (Hun)I have seen both sides ofNazi-Germany.If Hitler had not been so militaristic and intolerable to the Jews ,then Nazism would have been quite aremarkable kind of government.Peter Schuster"
5,Imagination Wookout,The Dropa's fantasy was a wonderful experience. I felt as if my imagination went through a long deserved workout. I could envision each and every character in this exciting story. A must for the young reader.
3,"Great concept, but didn't work for my application",This cable had trouble connecting properly to my equipment.
2,Doesn't grow hair,This doesn't regrow hair at all. But it is a nice shampoo and makes your hair feel thicker.
3,Shampoo ness,This shampoo is part of a treatment plan for professional results you need to purchase as part of a hair growth or restoration treatment plan.
1,Cre-C Shampoo Review,"I hate the Cre-C shampoo. I bought it, not expecting a miracle, but it didn't even come close to helping me a little bit. I guess my expectations were too high or maybe the hype on this product was just too much? Either way, this shampoo sucks. Not only was it a waste of money, but I literally hated the way the shampoo felt in my hair and how my hair felt afterwards. I was better off shampooing with actual poo. I want my money back."
1,too soon to review,"It seems to be working, but I have only used it for about 2 weeks, so it is too soon to say."
4,it works but takes time,"this product will not stop hairloss, however it does regrow hair after using cre c max for about five months+ i have noticed baby hairs growing to stop hairlass i would highly recomend revivogen"
2,nice shampoo but don't see new hair,"This product came quickly, It is easy to use, it has a nice oder to it, BUT I cant see any change in my hair growth at all in over a month of use, but Im still using it every day hopping thing will start to happpen."
2,Don't know if it works.,"I used it for like 2 months. But my hair started to fall off more, not sure if I was stressed or what, but it freaked me out so I stopped using it. My sister had told me my hair looks thicker and asked what I was doing? and if I had hair implants or what.. haha.. at that time all I was using was Ovation, and I figured hey if that works this seems more natural and is probably better. My hair thined out and every day I was loosing a lot of hair I don't know if it was because I stopped using ovation or if it was because of this shampoo. But I'm afraid to use it now, I know some products your hair falls off at first then grows new one but I can't afford to loose my hair if that's the case. I started to use the ovation again and my har hasn't fallen off as much and looks and feels thicker.. I can rub my hair wit my hands and I don't feel the scalp any more. Has any one had a similar experience?"
3,Cost effective,This is a pretty good shampoo for the price. However it does tend to dry out the hair and requires a good conditioner to balance it out.
4,natural,"i was introduced to Mexican hair products during my last trip there, this is good shampoo. kinda expensive, but worth every penny"
3,The Streets of Darkness,"Destiny's Price is a book which focuses on the Gothic-Punk streets of the World of Darkness. Though it was released as a Mage supplement it could be used by any White Wolf game line. This books looks at the darker side of mundane life in the rough world. Instead of discussing mages in the streets, we get information on gangs, organized crime groups, sex industries, street culture, and more. Sample areas and denizens of urban decay were included to help flesh out the streets. Some of the areas and people were very disturbing. It just goes to show that normal people can be just as creepy, if not more so than any supernatural creature. This book was released under the Black Dog label due to its graphic nature. This is a good resource but most of the information could be gathered from libraries, online, or just plain experience."
2,warning - it's a discontinued product,"i own this fridge. the evaporator fan motor just broke. turns out the fridge model was discontinued over 2 years ago, so they don't make parts for it. now i have to buy a new fridge.caveat emptor."
5,Great for kids and adults!,"My 6-year-old daughter recently received the Little Yogis tape as a gift, and she has been hooked ever since! We watch the tape and do the poses together as a workout, and she also watches the tape every night before she goes to bed - she really enjoys all the little songs and mini-video clips in between each pose. When we do the workout together, she really gets into it, instructing me on how to do the poses the right way! She is also learning about the health benefits of doing yoga and staying healthy, and is very inspired by how fun Wai Lana makes it to learn about health."
4,"Good lotion, great price in bulk!","My skin gets really dry in the winter, and this stuff is great. It doesn't smell too feminine, and it keeps your skin moist without a greasy feel."
3,Worthwhile Mistake,"I mistakenly bought this lotion when I was actually looking for ""Hemp Nation"" lotion by Australian Gold. The smell of this lotion is a tad strong, though it doesn't overpower once it is soaked in. It is reminiscent of ""Sweet Pea"" lotion from Victoria's Secret so if you liked that one, you are sure to like this.Overall, the moisture power is pretty good. Many lotions I have tried don't keep me moisturized for very long, but this one has staying power. Another bonus is that it didn't make me itch at all, like most flowery-smelly products do.I will definitely use this until it is gone, but next time I think i will go back to my Hemp Nation. The smell is much more crisp and light and the texture is more lotion-gel than just lotion like this one."
1,STAY AWAY!!!,A piece of crap: poor sound quality and bad song selection. Stick with the legitimate Smile and Good Vibration outtakes. I collect the Beach Boys and would have no problem shelling out $99 for a decent set. I wouldn't by this at half the price.
3,"Great looking, but can get hot","I travel a lot with my dog and I always get complements on this carrier. The quality is excellent and I love the privacy it offers. (Most other carriers have mesh on all sides.) However, because of the materials used and the lack of mesh around all sides, it can get hot if traveling in summer months."
2,3 3/8 inch Bi-Metal Hole Saw by Morse,"I probably should have spent a little more and maybe gotten a better bit. This bit and the provided arbor wobbled. I don't think it was the arbor, I think the bit wasn't up to par. I only had one project for this bit and didn't want to go thru the wait to get another so I slooooowly got my holes drilled (curved 1/8"" domed sheet meatal), but would recommend another supplier.Greg,San Jose, Ca"
5,Great easy out set!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a match to the simular item that some big name tool companys sell at about a third of the price! I believe it's the same kit, have used it on a grade 8 5/8 bolt and drilled it no problem.Great quality, even better price!!!"
5,Insightful and fresh book on a tough topic,"I found this book to be a fresh, insightful exploration of what the Bible actually teaches about women and ministry. Doriani does a good job of approaching the texts honestly and thoughtfully and with an open mind, earnestly seeking what the text says and means without a lot of bias from the preconceptions of one ""camp"" or another. It was wonderful to read a thoughtful, informed book about women in ministry that felt so un-biased and honest."
2,"One-Sided Look at Prejudice, Discrimination, and Ethnoviolen","I had to get this book for a class that I am taking this semester. I figured from the title that this book would offer different viewpoints on education, discrimination, ethnoviolence, and all the other topics that are discussed within the cover pages. I was wrong. For every 4 liberal articles saying that everything is messed up, there is 1 conservative article expressing a different point of view. It is extremely one-sided on it's viewpoint and leaves someone who is for meritocracy (working for what you get in life) feeling like a racist even if they don't have a racist bone in their body. Not a good buy, especially if you want CONTENDING viewpoints on the issue."
4,Delerue's OUR MOTHER'S HOUSE...Superb !,"We have Film Score Monthly to thank for this 2003 CD re-issue. The score for OUR MOTHER'S HOUSE was previously issued on LP legitimately only in Canada twice: 1967 (M.G.M./Quality) and 1978 (M.G.M./Polydor). The new CD presents this mostly quiet, haunting and melodic score with an absence of extraneous pops and ticks (thankfully !), though the LPs had better dynamic range. THE 25TH HOUR,(1967), also included on this release features another excellent (though very different) music score. Turner is to be heartily thanked for allowing these two Delerue efforts to see the light of day again, in spite of some sonic shortcomings. And both OUR MOTHER'S HOUSE and THE 25TH HOUR deserve DVD releases ASAP to help popularize these two intriguing, little-known scores..."
2,A good idea gone bad,"Originally Michelle Forbes was to go from Star Trek Next Generation to the Deep Space Nine show when she quit, Kira Nerys was created. So this book is sort of tongue in cheek. Unfortunately the blending of so many writers convolutes not the plot but the tone of the novel. Though it's not apparent who wrote what to avoid particular criticisms all of these writers, while versed in Star Trek have different styles.So this book fails."
2,"Good, but not great......","I am a BIG fan of Deep Space Nine, so I obviously love to read Deep Space Nine books. But this one, well, wasn't so good. The plot is OK, and the characters are OK, but it just didn't do it for me. The Ro/Kira thing was good, but I didn't think it was right that Ro and Kira took on a whole criminal ring and won. Plus, I didn't think that Sisko would ever let Quark pilot the Defiant, so that was pretty dumb, and why would Sisko leave Deep Space Nine without a crew???? It just doesn't make sense. I'm not a fan of Friedman, and I don't know who the other two people are, but I just hope that the two of you break off relations with Friedman, and write a new Deep Space Nine book."
3,Slightly better than mediocre.,"This book is about par for a Star Trek: Deep Space Nine novel; it's a bit better than mediocre, but not good enough to rate four stars. On the plus side, the combined writing effort was pretty seamless; I didn't notice stylistic changes that tipped me off to when one of the authors stopped and another one took over. Also, Ro Laren was handled well, and if the strained interaction between her and Kira was a bit overdone, it wasn't badly so. On the down side, the moral of the subplot involving Chief O'Brien was just WRONG; the idea that it would have been wrong of him to take time off from work in order to be with his possibly dying daughter is a moral that I am appalled by.In general, though, most of the story was just ""pretty good"", a standard example of the genre that was not overly memorable but an interesting enough read."
3,"By no means a classic, but I have seen and read worse.","Although a devoted follower of the TV series, I do not usually read DS9 novels. I was tempted on this occasion as I was an avid fan of Ro Laren from TNG. Despite certain flaws particularly with characterisation, the book was an enjoyable read. Worth at least the time and money, if nothing more."
3,What is that thing on the cover?,"One of the reasons I read this book was because I wondered if the strange ""thing"" behind DS9(on the cover) was an alien warship and DS9 was being invaded. Now I know that there is no such thing in the entire book, and that was a major disapointment. Overall, the book is enjoyable, it is fast-paced, but the storyline is rushed.Not one of these three authors' best efforts. If you want to read a good book by these three authors (writing together, like in this book), check out Star Trek TOS #59:""The Disinherited"". Also, I'm hoping for a book featuring a ""real"" wrath of the Prophets."
2,I'll read anything with Kai Winn in it,"I must be one of the only trekkies who likes Kai Winn, so I read this book. Boy, what a mistake. The plot was boring and Kai Winn was meek. I guess I'll have to wait for the new DS9 trilogy."
1,A waste of paper (and I'm a Peter David fan),"It's been more than a year since I read this, but these worst bits are still quite fresh in my memory. 1. Appearently, the only way to get around on Bajor is by foot, otherwise Ro and Kira would have at least hailed a taxi, what with all the lives on the line. 2. Sisko and Quark taking the Defiant without a crew makes absolutely no sense. I can only assume that that part was written with the intention of using a runabout and they had to change it to the Defiant so that the ship would be in the novel at all. 3. Dax is reduced to a thinly veiled plot device (of the Greek variety).Naturally, I now have to read reviews of novels Peter David merely co-writes, rather than just being able to buy and enjoy them like the majority of his works."
3,Ro vs. Kira in Deathmatch Bajor.,"An interesting pairing of strong characters leads us through an almost textbook ""find the cure"" and ""save the planet"" novel.Having 3 outhors may ad creativity to the storyline, but it does cause significant changes in the tone of chapters and the vocabulary used."
4,Overlooked gem with some real shine.,"This one was a surprise for me; I found it in a bargain bin somewhere, and rescued it. I've never been more pleased with a CD I hadn't heard before purchasing! Take a listen to some of these tracks, especially ""April's Fool"", the approach the Beatles should have taken to Eastern religion! And they don't stop there. These guys are tight, and they deserve a lot more attention. They've got good hooks, good ideas, and they're a LOT more interesting than most of the ""hot"" bands out today. I prefer them to Oasis and their ilk, and I think they compare favorably to Fastball, and Weezer. I hope you get a chance to hear for yourself!"
3,3 1/2,"I heard of this Texas group from Noel Gallagher who mentioned them in some interview. So out of curiousity i checked them out. When I finally heard them I understood why Noel liked them, Cotton Mather is even more Beatle-ish than Oasis (if you consider Oasis beatle-ish). Now for there music. The lead singer does a near perfect John Lennon impression on alot of the songs. To witness this listen to there other album Kon Tiki on the song ""Home Cameo"" you can barely tell the difference, and i've been listening to Lennon for years, so I kid you not. Alot of the songs are a bit on the corny side, which is why they get a 3 1/2 rating. This is guitar pop/rock with a huge influence of The Beatles. If you like the band Fastball, you will probably like this as well. Dan."
5,A REMEMBRANCE OF PAST DAYS,THIS TV PROGRAM WAS A FAVORITE OF MY OLDEST SON WHEN HE WAS LITTLE BOY. HE ALWAYS KNEW WHEN IT WAS TO COME ON AND SAT RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE TV TO WATCH. I GAVE HIM THIS COPY AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR HIM TO WATCH WITH HIS SON .
2,CST-Computer Service Technician,"The book is outdated, the fastest chip discussed in the manual is a Pentium 200 Mz. It would only be worth the cost if you were working on older computers. The book is full of typos and grammatical errors, averaging 4 per page, I would say. It is not a book for beginners, a good working knowledge of computer hardware is beneficial. I bought this book based on the other review, it now sounds like something the author or publisher would post. I would recommend you look around for something more current with the computer field."
3,Provides useful information,"I bought this book to supplement what I was learning at a computer technician course. While a bit outdated, the information provided in this book was very valuable and provided insights into some aspects of computers that I did not have before. In fact some information contained in this book is difficult to find anywhere else. I would recommend it for the technician who wants to have a thourough and indept understanding of computers."
4,A true value for a low price.,"CST is an excellant tool if you want to know the technical workings of computers, especially older models. To the end user its often too advanced and outdated, to the advanced technician its a treasure chest of knowledge. Like the fading of true technical computer experts, appreciation for this knowledge, unfortunately, is fading as well."
1,"good idea, poor execution","The lube stick is a good idea, with a good shape and size for application and would have reduced normal mess that is associated with wax applications. The wax seems to work okay, but I've not used a great deal of it. But, the tube design leaves a lot to be desired. You push the wax up from the bottom, which is good, only exposing as much as you want. But, the stupid cap is made to go on the INSIDE of the tube, so either you have to push the wax back down into the tube to give clearance to the cap or you have to leave off the cap and allow any airborne contaminants to get on the wax. It's such a simple thing that one has to wonder if the designer ever actually used such products.Lastly, the cost of the product combined with shipping charges doesn't seem like a good value to me. I'll not be buying another one when this one is used up."
3,one collar broke,"really liked the product but after two weeks, the plastic clasp on one of the collars broke so we threw it away; there was no fixing it."
2,Very tight fit,"I went with this design because the other looked like it had battery clips that could snap off. This one is not too impressive either - the only thing that holds the battery in the charger is a tight fit, which is a bit too tight. I'm a pretty strong guy who does a lot of mechanical work with my hands, and I needed to get a pair of channel lock pliers to pull the battery out of the charger after pushing it into place for charging... The marks on the battery are not pretty, but it was not really damaged."
4,Very satisfied,We were very happy with the quality of the product and the efficiency with which it was delivered. It's just what we wanted.
2,"good design, poor execution","I like the design of this barrel, but the construction is poor. It is molded in two halves and the halves are misaligned by 3/16"" of an inch. The seam is also where you attach linking hoses etcetera, thus the misalignment makes attaching a hose more troblesome. Lastly, it comes with a crappy plastic spigot. I am not overly impressed considering the cost."
3,This is it!!!,"Actually the review is 5 stars. For some reason...I can't change it. Anyway...I have been rocking these discs over and over since it came out (Dec. 2003). If you want to get a feeling of what a typical Saturday night is like at Club Space (Miami) then pick this disc up immediatly. Dark, progressive, Deep, Drums...there is no label for this set. Great $hit."
5,"Air Horns, Sirens, and Pounding Bass OH MY!","Definitly my favorite CD that I own right now! It is absolutly amazing! It is impossible to listen to this CD and not dance. You feel like you are right there at Space, you can hear the crowd, you can hear the horns, the sirens and that incredible music you can't remember for the life of you after you leave the club. I recommend this CD to all lovers of Oscar G, Space, Miami, and hard, deep, spine tingling house music....stop reading this review and buy the cd!"
4,Live at Space - Oscar G,"This is a unique 2 disk set. The first is focused on recent vocal plays and is interesting - however, it is fairly traditional in selecting currently popular music. The GEM is Disk #2. It is entirely the opposite of #1 and focus on more synthetic music with strong base and beat."
4,Good notebook for the price,"The lcd screen is the best. The system gets heated up a little bit but I guess I can deal with it. The battery life is around 2.5 hours as mentioned. But this is the lower limit, I am running this with the power savings option. The system does not come with recovery or operating system cd, which is really bad. The sound quality is ok, not great but not bad either. For around $1250 after $250 rebates, I guess this is really a good choice. Its better than the 13.3"" S series notbook, because the S series notebooks gets heated up soo much that you cannot handle them. This FS series is much better than them."
1,Not Reliable!,"This laptop model crashed two times within a year. The first was the hard disk and now the motherboard. I have a friend bought a newer model and the battery life decreases big time with in 2 months of usage.Sony does not provide me with satisfactory service, even it is covered with a guarantee. They wont agree to do the service unless I call the support million times.Nice laptop but not reliable at all and bad maintenance support...Hope Sony will improve its industry, as it used to be..."
3,Bad choice of songs,"All of the songs on this cd are great, but about half of them have been on other disney cds. I can't wait was on the Lizzie McGuire soundtrack, The tide is high was on the Lizzie McGuire movie Soundtrack, All I can do was on the Lizzie McGuire Soundtrack, That's so raven was on the That's so raven soundtrack, Us against the world was on the Lizzie McGuire soundtrack, and You make me feel like a star was on the Lizzie McGuire movie soundtrack. (...)"
4,Stop Repeating,"Disney cds are good but they reuse the same damn songs like 15 times!!! Lindsays Ultimate-Freaky Friday & Mega Movie cd or whatever its called! and Hilary Duff they Used Why Not on 5 cds that I have! They need to get these artist to record new songs for Radio Disney Jams! Get Hotter Artist!!! like put a songs on by Lalaine ""You Wish"" or ""Haunted"" & Lindsay Lohan ""Over"" or ""Rumors"" & Play ""Unspeakable"" & 3LW ""Fall Back"" or ""After This"" & Jesse McCartney ""Shes No You"" N E WAY just get new songs!!!!"
1,I'd Give It 0 Stars If I Could,Who listens to this junk! All these songs are old and annoying. The people who make these should grow up.
3,If you like Radio Disney...,"If you like Radio Disney you'll probably like this CD since these are all Radio Disney faves. Do I like them? No, but they are innocent and fun enough for the kiddies.The only reason I even checked the CD out is because I heard Lalaine's song ""You Wish"" (a popular radio disney tune) was supposed be on this cd, but it's mysteriously been replaced by the A*teens. Oh well, if you're a Lalaine fan you can spend the money buying it on her own cd from her website."
3,The red Erasermate doesn't work well on all types of paper ...,"I take a lot of notes and thought the red erasermate would be perfect as an alternative to highlighting my notes. On one level, yes they worked, but on another they failed. I sometimes use large yellow pads when making lengthy lists. The red erasermate leaves a definite mark behind, often smudging the ink into a pinkish mess. Every erasure leaves some trace of the ink on the yellow paper, but does an excellent job when I'm using white.The eraser is set in on a slant, unlike a pencil which holds it in nicely, but makes it more difficult to use when it wears down. They do clip nicely to a pocket or notebook because the clip has quite a bit of flexibility to it. They are an inexpensive pen, but if you plan on using them on an alternate color paper, you may wish to pass. If you want to use them to correct papers, they would probably be an acceptable choice. All in all, not all that pleased with them."
5,Sweetness Defined!,"First bought this as an album in 73-74 while in Germany as a GI. We all loved it then and now since I've turned- on my friends here in the states they all love it. I know of 2 others that have ordered it through Amazon since I got it on disc a couple months ago through Amazon. This album will bring you up when down, mellow you when needed and thoroughly blow your mind. Full of surprises and fantastic solos. Sweet, sweet, sweet; thank you for making this available Amazon!"
2,Just OK,"In which Charley decides to ride the Dakar, enlists 2 experienced team mates, receives BMW bikes prepped by Touratech, a staff SUV from BMW (then modified by a leading off road builder) and a 40 ton support truck loaded with spares. He also gets 2 mechanics and a team manger plus a couple of camera folks. Back in London he has an office with full support staff. He then proceeds to whine throughout most of the documentary.If you're expecting much racing footage in a documentary about a 9,000 KM off-road rally you'll be disappointed. Some oft-repeated wide shots and brief helmet cams from Charlie's team bikes is about it. As for other competitors, unless they're talking to one of our team they may as well not exist.It's worth watching but probably not worth buying if you get my drift."
3,Well-crafted poems with a lot of stuff for writers to steal,"If you get easily bored with poetry, but desperately love it anyway -- read this. The writing is complex, yet spare. I intend to reread Muske's book to catch what monster catfish I missed the first time. If you want something fun and superficial, try Hal Sirowitz and not this."
2,"Valiant attempt by Avalon Hill, but a flawed one all the same..","This attempt by Avalon Hill to create a Word War I air fighting game is basically flawed, but that does not mean it is not fun in a way.The game is very simple to learn and play, but with enough rules that simulate fairly ok dog fihgts in World War I. What dooms the game is, basically, it's letality. The ""mpossible maneuver"" that the rules allows you to makes that everyone fires at anyone at every turn.Such was the concept wrong, that Avalon Hill tried to correct that by releasing the much more complex (and realistic) ""KNIGHTS OF THE AIR"".RICHTHOFEN'S WAR is not bad. But there's no sense in playing it again and again. AIR FORCE (World War II) is so much superior to it. KNIGHTS OF THE AIR also is (although it is not so easy to explain to first-timpe players)."
1,Can I give it less than 1 star?,This software just does not work. When scanning my drive it gets stuck on 1 sector for more than an hour--program is totally unresponsive--I have to kill it using Windows Task Manager. It never completes the scan. Iolo tech support does not respond to repeated inquiries. Avoid! Waste of money!
3,It Could Have Been So Much More...,"While this program is okay, next time, I will buy differently. It could have been so much more, but is severely hamstrung. When you open it up your only option is to search your ENTIRE drive for ALL deleted files. And, depending on the size of your drive and how much content you have on it, you are going to be there awhile. This, while I only wanted to search for a single picture whose title I knew. Also, a feature to allow you to search for SPECIFIC file types would have been nice too. I don't use this program often because I know when I open it up, to pack a lunch."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this software to recover files from the hard-drive of a laptop that had stopped working. The software showed some .cab files on the hard-drive but nothing else. It was completely useless and a waste of money.Later I downloaded Stellar Phoenix data recovery software and had all the files recovered in less than 15 minutes. It was more expensive ($100), but atleast it worked.Do not waste your money on this product."
2,is this a joke ?,"I wouldnt waste my time or money with this book. Obviously, the author is forcing her Wiccan viewpoint here. She trys to say that we can reduce it all to 1 goddess. Maybe the author should have looked into the origins of the various names of the Freyja and Frigga before making such an outragous claim.The reviewer below me *J. Dougherty ""Kalimir""* wrote that ""This book is the first one ever written soley about the Divine Feminine of the North"". I had to laugh out loud at that ridiculous statement (see below).Instead of this book, I would recommened:1. Roles of the Northern Goddess by Hilda Davidson - Published in 1998or2. Magic of the Norse Goddesses: Mythology-Ritual-Tranceworking by Alice Karlsdóttir (available through Runa-Raven Press)Reyn til Runa"
1,Not for true students of the norse,"I found this book to be disturbing, as a student of norse mythology and a follower of Asatru. The lore was faulty and some of the interpretations ludicrous,as well as giving sexual denomination to asexual concepts. When compared to the texts that are claimed to be used in it's writing, the conclusions become a joke. This book seemed to be a wiccan book, trying to clump all goddesses as one goddess. While I agree that there is much lore missing about the Norse Goddesses, this was a poor attempt at best."
1,Definitely not an Asatru viewpoint,Lynda C. Welch writes her book from a Wiccan perspective. She attempts to bring her reader around to her idea that all of the Asynjur (Aesir and Vanir Goddesses) are really just different perspectives of one Goddess. The Wiccans believe that in the final analysis there is only one God and one Goddess. While there is nothing wrong with having such a belief system it is shameful to try to underhandedly misrepresent your belief system on those seeking knowledge of the Goddesses of their path.As an Asatrur this book is highly offensive for the above reason. The Asynjur found in the Eddas are named and their deeds are written for all who wish to honor them.As a Gydhja (Asatru priestess) I would recommend that any who seek to learn of the deeds of the Goddesses not waste their money on this book.
1,Emotional Drivel,"In the foreward the author states that she was inspired to write this book by the birth of her first child. This should have been a tip-off. I was very intrigued by the concept of this book and deeply disappointed by the shallowness and subjectivity of the content. This book is a classic example of an author thinking with her glands instead of her brain. There is no scholarship here, no research, just a lot of breathy pnuematic opinion stated as fact and dressed up with charts that assign Goddess correspondences in a more-or-less arbitrary manner. It isn't even feminist in the true sense, merely an emotional cathartic spew. It's fine that the author's new status as a mother inspired her to explore the feminine divine. It's too bad she didn't just keep a diary instead of inflicting her unsubstantiated theories on us."
2,Well.....,"As someone who is deeply interested in the Norse Mythos, I dove into this book with lots of enthusiasm, and it left me, well, not deeply impressed I guess.I felt that anything pertaining to actual mythos was pretty good, but I felt the author become badly repetetive towards the end, and also became quite preachy.Particularly near the end she starts criticizing modern civilization for not keeping the ways of the Norse, and then in the same chapter, make amazingly condescending remarks about them.I felt this was an interesting read, but she needs to keep her emotions out of it."
2,I am not convinced,"This book tries to present itself as an academic study into the Goddess in Norse tradition. The cover, typefont and lay out with footnotes all try to ooze 'academic research' but it is not. What it is, is a work that tries to construct a primeordeal Norse Goddess from a tradition that is - perhaps even more than any other western pagan tradition - polytheist and animist.The bibliography contains too many titles by Llewellyn to be taken seriously as an academic research. From an academic research I expect original material, from disciplines like theology, history, archeology, antropology, but not work that derives from popular science.Some lines of thought - like those concerning Ygdrassil - are interesting, but generally I think it's rather too much wishful thinking and constructionwork. The conclusions that the author draws from her data are not as selfevident as she would have them.I am not convinced"
1,Nothing but rudimentary history,"I read this book as part of the assigned reading for Professor's McClellan's class at the University of Virginia on Russia since 1917. The book, like the lectures and Professor McClellan in general, were none too impressive. The book has no new insights and does not even attempt to look at things in any sort of a new light. Instead, it is very traditional and not very good. The writing of the author is not noteworthy nor compelling. Thankfully, though, in the book McClellan does not make the outrageous and unfounded accusation that he makes in the class: that Lenin's last testament was a fraud."
5,Not perfect but extremely enjoyable,"Beethoven's 9th is a perfect vehicle for DVD. You have a large orchestra, a nice size chorus and four soloists. This 9th was performed to celebrate the end of communism for Czechoslovakia. I found the performance extremely enjoyable. The tempos are on the slow side but the music never fails to keep moving. The orchestral playing is not perfect but has plenty of feeling. The soloists are good, if not great. The chorus is superb. The video quality is excellent. I wish there were some extras but they are quite rare in classical music DVDs. This would make a real nice gift."
5,excellent album,Not a bad song on it. Allie Danielle has a voice to be proud of and she shows it off. Hope to hear more from her. Some of Texas country's best.
2,Disappointed....,"This set is pretty disappointing compared to what I expected. And the reason is not so much the story lines (they're mostly pretty good) -- it is the campy, extremely stilted, amateur acting. . . I mean it's consisently bad across every episode we've watched so far. . now I admit I'm only halfway through the episodes (so we're on disk 3). The acting is so bad it is nearly painful - it's like watching people who've never acted standing up with scripts and just reading awkwardly with either no, or too much, expression. . . . I keep expecting their ""acting coach"" to step in and correct them. And keep in mind when reading this review, I wasn't expecting anything spectacular . . I figured this series would be along the lines of the old Friday the 13th TV series as far as quality of acting, script, production etc., which would have been just fine...but this is just . . well...bad. Even for the price."
3,Ghost Stories?,"I haven't watched many of the episodes presented on these DVDs, but most of those that I did watch had little to do with ghosts. I wouldn't recommend these DVDs to those truly interested in the spirit world, but their entertainment value isn't bad."
1,Ghost of old TV series,"I am not sure when I bought this but I am glad the series is dead now and hope it doesn't come back to haunt me. I don't know which is worse: the plot, the narration, the acting or the directing. I'll just be glad when it is dead and buried."
2,Very boring,"These stories are very, very boring. They also do not have any commentaries describing the origins of the story, when or where it happened, or any ideas of who the ghost was before they died. The stories seem like they are completely made up. I don't know if they are, but that's the impression I got when I watched them. They are not scary at all.The acting and directing is also not very good. I have watched Unsolved Mysteries - Ghosts many, many times and I still love them! They are very interesting, creepy and make me really believe that ghosts exist. Watching Ghost Stories makes me yawn."
2,Mildy entertaining.,"Not very interesting, low key stories that will put you to sleep with mindless slow, dull stories."
2,Breaks easily....,This broke so quick..... we got a second one thinking maybe my 4 year old was playing too rough with it.... and the next one broke right away as well.
1,what an elastic girl!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,last week I bought elastic girl and jack jack to my 3 year old daughter from italy as a gift and came back to turkey.it broke that day.she doesn't have an arm anymore and can not replace it.helen can not even hold jack jack and my daughter is very upset......
4,klutz hemp bracelets,"Got it for our nine, almost ten year old daughter for Christmas. She needs help getting started from her 16 year old sister but then she is able to do the patterns by herself. She isn't the type of person that just loves to do crafts, but this is, nevertheless, something she picks to do with some of her free time. She is pleased with how well it looks as finished and she is usu. able to finish a necklace in total time of about an hour and a half or two. It is something you can start and leave and come back to and finish without getting discouraged or overwhelmed for the ave. 10 year old I'd say. Sometimes an older brother or sister will take a turn and do a couple of rounds on the pattern. Pleased with it."
5,This dvd rocks!,"I just loved the DVD. Melissa Etheridge is such am amazing performer that it only does her justice to watch her live. The whole DVD is fun and exciting; it feels like you're really at one of her shows, which as we all know are the best. Plus you get all the extra features like an interview with Melissa and the cameras follow her around New York City! I thought it was so cool cause I got to see what she does to get her self prepared for a big show. The concert footage is incredible, it's like you have the best seat in the house. The whole show rocks!"
4,Wow...,"I was at this show. it was AMAZING and i find it hard to believe people would be dissapointed...*shrug* to each her own, I suppose. I'm very surprised..."
4,Lucky Birthday!,"My best friend Doris and I actually attended the concert that is featured in the Lucky Live DVD & CD for my Birthday in April 2004 - We had an awesome time! At the actual concert Melissa played lots of old songs... I just wish they were on the DVD and CD since the songs from the Lucky album are not my favorite, but I can't complain because my 33rd Birthday will be forever immortalized on disc - now that's LUCKY!"
3,Fun Overview of Jewish Humor -- whatever that is!,"Telushkin--clearly a writing machine--has penned a highly enjoyable overview of Jewish humor, complete with plenty of jokes. He has broken down the humor by category, but truly, this is just a fun romp through a type of humor that has so permeated American culture that many of the jokes have been translated into other formats (with rabbis changing into Priests or Pastors, for example).This ain't anything to knock your socks off, but it's an enjoyable read."
5,Marciano/Ali the computer fight,"I agree that Rocky Marciano was the greatest boxer of all times. My interest however is in a movie made about a fight between him and Ali called ""The Super Fight"" in 1969 which was fin ished just three weeks before his death.Do you have any information?"
4,Much welcome trip back to my Childhood / teen years.,"I quit wrestling around... 2002 I'd say .... but 90's wrestling was the BEST. Even before the Attitude era, Vince McMahon spiced things up with betrayals, Good guys losing, and the one constant who's 'lived' through several eras... The Undertaker(tm). This was seriously great to see highlights the Golden years of wrestling. It is still quite entertaining!"
3,OMG!,"The 2 hour special was honestly very good. It lived up to exactly what it was and that was the best OMG moments. It covers from the 80s all the way to 2010 so it's a good spread, some moments we'd figure would surely make the set along with moments that I didn't think would make it onto the set. (And moments like Lunchtime suicide that should not have been on the list lol)But the 2 discs of extras are all moments and matches that are already on numerous dvds. Not to mention the whole video is done in the ""slightly bootlegged quality"" of video. Not bad, but not the best either."
2,Not Worth Repeated Viewing,"I'm glad I saw this on Netflix so I don't have to worry about adding this to my DVD collection. I enjoy watching a lot of the WWE's documentaries since the majority of them offer glimpses of why I enjoy watching wrestling to non-fans. But while half of the ""OMG!"" moments on here are valid pieces of history that still play well today, the other half would make me cringe while non-fans would look at me and say, ""You really enjoy this?""Now that I've seen this on my own, I don't have to be in the same room with a non-fan while Mae Young gives birth to a rubber hand..."
3,meh,"Glad i saw it on netflix before purchasing it. i love wrestling just as much as the next person but to me some of the moments wern't omg,there were others that i thought of that could have been used. it was alright though."
1,Good Highlights With One MAJOR Problem!!,"First, I've loved pro wrestling since I was 7 years old in 1986. I love WWE documentaries. This, however, isn't one of them!While most of the selected footage is appropriate, the commentary on them IS NOT! They are talking about these incidents like a full blown shoot! The Hebner/Hogan/Andre angle is discussed as though a real conspiracy took place! That's insulting the fan's intelligence. Perhaps they're trying to protect the business again since more kids are fans but who knows. Total bomb!"
3,1998 King of the Ring AGAIN?! Come on WWE!,"This is a pretty good DVD with some rarely seen footage, but I wish WWE would retire the 1998 King of the Ring HIAC match footage. It's on 'Mick Foley's Greatest Hits and Misses', it's on 'A History of the Undertaker', it's on 'Hell in a Cell' DVD and I can understand it being on those DVDs but I have all three of those and now OMG! has it too. I'm not saying it wasn't a shocking and amazing match, it's one of my favorites for the simple fact that Mick continued the match after his fall. But come on, WWE, do you have to find a way to include it on any DVD about shocking things? Or, you could've included it in the documentary because it was shocking, but not include the match in the special because I can't be the only person who now has multiple DVDs with that match on it."
2,not good,well first off its just things that haopoened bugt thats it just from back in the day like usual yhingsd its better of for kids
2,OMG! This is annoying!,"This would have been a very good DVD release if not for the incredibly annoying, hip-hop tinged intonation of ""Oh My God"" in between every single segment! Seriously, it got so annoying that I nearly turned it off. The segments themselves were pretty good and thankfully there was no censorship, but I just had a really hard time getting past what has to be the most annoying theme music of all time being played between every segment."
2,OMG is right,"the 1st disc was Good.. but after that on the next two disc it started to repeat , i thought for sure cause ite wwe it was going to be Awesome.. but I am not a Fan of this DVD."
2,Not so great,"I will not write a very long review since I did not finish watching this program. Basically it is another top 50 WWE events list. I made it through to number 45 before the theme music completely ruined this production. After each event, the them music of about 30+ seconds would start and then another 2 or 3 minute piece of WWE history would start. I think I turned off the program after it showed the Big Show tossing the Undertaker through the WWE ring. Overall, It might have been a good program if the editors had chosen not to over play the theme music throughout the DVD."
1,Did not want blu-ray or american copy,"I did no want blu-ray or a us version of the dvd as i cant watch it at all, now ive opened it i cant return it and i have no dvd and ive lost my money, so a bit upset to be honest"
2,blah,"i bought ""castaways and cutouts"" first and fell in love with the band. so, i decided to buy this album, thinking that it must be good if the other was. i had read these reviews, where most people said the album was amazing and found this was not the case. i was disappointed when i listened to it the first time. the songs were almost boring. they could not keep my attention at all and none of them were catchy or even memorable for that matter. i recommend ""castaways and cutouts"" not this album."
3,no real comment,"Bought this as a gift, so I don't have much to say other than the fact that I got a very nice thank you note out of it so this must be a decent album."
5,differences,"well, to the two reviewers below me:a) it is pretty obvious red right ankle is a reference to nick cave, don't you consider? so that it is similar should come as no surprise given the fact that they admit it themselves.b) the decemberists, yes, they are very similar to Neutral Milk Hotel, but i don't see myself showing off a banner that states the Decemberists created a new genre and NMH didn't..., nobody has said so, so if you are angry because the sounds are alike, it's your problem, not an excuse to dismiss the band. there are very basic differences between both, by the way.i'm sick of the i'm-indier-than-thou, u indier-than-thou person. i'm just pretty tired of some reviewers and of other reviewers who come to complain about those."
4,Solid sophomore,"Expanding Meloy's unique branch of smarty-pants, historical role-playing indie has enough compositional fortitude to make for a great spin, even if the presentation may be off-putting for some hearing a perceivable pomp lingering in vocal delivery."
3,neutral milk hotel,this band sounds absolutely nothing like NMH in any way shape or form. I dont know if it is good or not yet but why so much talk about NMH when there isnt a thing that reminds me of NMH.
2,Just because it's folky and wierd...,"doesn't make it good. I've heard a lot of people compare these guys to Neutral Milk Hotel, and maybe that's why I found everything on this record so thin and boring by comparison to Jeff Magnum's great work. Really, it sounds to me more like a band trying too hard to fit that NMH niche. At first listen, a few of the songs seem right there (hence, I bought the album). But, upon further listenings, I found that those songs were the only ones worth listening to, and when mixed with the other faux-artistic, droney songs on the record, even they lost their lustre. I already returned the disc. Don't waste your time with these guys."
3,Just a comment I needed to make,"I listened to ""Red Right Ankle"" and thought, ""gee, this sounds familiar."" About ten seconds in, I realized that maybe it's because the guitar line is a complete rip off of ""Which Will"" by Nick Drake. In fact, I would think it wasn't half bad if I didn't have Pink Moon to compare it to. But I do, and it renders this laughable in comparison.Of course, I have heard a lot more from these guys than just ""Red Right Ankle,"" and to me they come off as artificial as any group I've ever heard. There's art music that's cool and legit (like the Fiery Furnaces before ""Rehearsing...""), but this stuff is just artsy for the sake of being artsy farsty. No soul, no guts, no heart. That's what I hear, anyway. But apparently people like them, so I digress."
2,yet another from the creative writing school factory,The music is really solid and quite beautiful. But I had to sell it after a few listens because the vocals started to grate on my last nerve. And the lyrics are a little too clever for this band's own good.
4,Eh?,I haven't actually listened to this CD. I just thought the title was decent enough. 4 out of 5!!!
1,You're joking right?,Your not? Oh boy then you could have seriously used an overbearing father who forced sports on to you at a young age. I mean jeez at first I thought you were like making fun of some effeminate drama coach or something? You weren't? Uh O.K. well-(dramatic pause) I guess i'm gonna-I mean if that was really just you messin around tryin to be funny and stuff then its a five really.Oh you were serious huh well-(awkward silence)
4,bold and ambitious,"The songs on this album are very well written, crafted I suppose, and the lyrics are interesting and obscure enough to peak my curiosity. I won't bother comparing this to Band X or Album Y, it is a very solid album from start to finish. I don't know if I'd call it experimental, but for those with more vanilla tastes, I'd suggest trying something else."
5,One of those guys on the cover looks like George Orwell!,"All I have to say is, this is the first pop group that has forced me to consult a dictionary since I started listening to Dylan back in highschool - Conlin Meloy is full of fun, clever, exotic lyrics and strong melodies - and the band sounds great. Piano, organs, guitars, drums, accordian, stand-up bass - all tight and well executed. ""Billy Liar"" alone is worth the price of addmission. Enjoy!"
4,"Colin's from Missoula, not Portland or Australia","I enjoy Her Majesty. The songs and Colin's voice are really different but that's the draw. Also if you get a chance to listen to ""Tarkio"" Colin's old Missoula band, do it, you won't be sorry."
3,Material quality good - assembly terrible,"Purchased this guitar as a cheap rig to teach my kids to play.For the price, I was impressed with the materials quality/hardware of this guitar.The black finish on the body is very cheap though, and has noticable blemishes.However, the assembly was HORRIBLE and would be a major concern to someone who did not know how to set up a guitar.1) All bolts/screws were loose. Including the neck bolts!2) Fret edges were VERY sharp, spent about an hour filing them down.3) Neck totally out of adjustment. I would say this is fine, since they should be shipped this way but I don't think it was intentional.4) Intonation way off, needs a good tuning.My main gripes are because Dean claims to set these guitars up in the US after they come from the manufacturer overseas.I think that's total BS to be honest.But, you get what you pay for and for $85 I got a lot."
3,Pretty good,"This nook looks really cute. We LOVE the storage in the seats. Was fairly easy to put together with two people. However, we have two main problems. The single bench piece isn't very sturdy. You can't have someone heavy sit on it. My husband weighs about 150 lbs and he bends it. The other benches are sturdy though. Also, on the corner piece, the screws didn't exactly line up right with the premade holes so it stripped the hole and now the one part on the top is kind of sticking up. It's not too noticeable unless you're sitting right there."
5,love this table,"I read all of the reviews and was not worried with some of the negative reviews. Some of the other reviews I'd like to address, if you had a heavy duty oak table you can't accurately compare these because this isn't a solid oak table, you get what you pay for, this is a good table for the price you pay. The review about benches not being sturdy not sure why theirs are not, I have someone heavier that sits on them and it does just fine. This table is very sturdy, it is beautiful, it took 2 people to put it together, but it was not hard. My only complaint is on the corner platform and where the back of the bench meet there is a gap of about 1/2 an inchother than that its perfect."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This so called table is TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!! Came in four boxes. Description states that it ""requires some assembly"" REALLY????????????? You would need a masters in engineering to put this table together. Pieces were almost ALL damaged. The material is so CHEAP. This table isn't worth a dime, let alone over $300. On a positive note, AMAZON customer service was EXCELLENT. Arranged to have this junk picked up from my house for return and refund."
5,Great,"was a pain to put together, came in four separate boxes, but the end result was well worth it. very happy with this purchase."
4,Great but be gentle with it,"If you want a top quality piece to last a lifetime, this isn't it, but for a great value you can't beat it. It wasn't too hard to put together, but it did arrive with two pieces that were damaged. Customer service was excellent and got us replacement pieces easily and quickly. We are enjoying it very much with the understanding that we can't beat up on it too much. Every now and again, a screw falls out of the bench, but they included glue to hold them in. All in all, we would buy again."
3,"Cheap, but good solution for a nook","for the price, this is a good nook set. if you are looking for quality, long-lasting construction - don't buy this. but if you want something that will suffice for the short-term, this is probably a pretty good option.to those less handy, beware. the putting this set together is hell.it took 3 of us 2 hours to put this together. the instructions are terrible, so if you do get this set make sure you read them over really carefully before starting. also, the instructions advise not to use power tools to tighten screws - REALLY?! There are nearly 80 screws involved in its construction! doing all the assembly by hand would have taken much longer. we carefully used a household screwdriver and it worked fine - just be careful not to over-tighten.overall, i'm happy with this set. the size is such that my 20 month old toddler can sit on the bench and have the table at a perfect height to eat at."
1,"Used product sold as ""new""","I ordered this product and it arrived in four separate boxes that weighed over 150 pounds. I cleared out an area of my house to assemble it, and when I opened the first box, I discovered that not only was the product damaged, but it had been partially assembled and then disassembled. Amazon sold this product to me as ""new"" and that was absolutely not the case. Buyer beware."
1,NOT STURDY AT ALL,"VERY CHEAP MATERIAL, AT ANY POINT IT MAY BRAKE. VERY DISSAPOINTED I WISH I COULD'VE GOTTEN MY MONEY BACK $300+ DOWN THE DRAIN"
4,for the true fan,"i paid $30 for this cd at a seatlle record shop one day...it was a total gamble as i was waiting and WAITING for a new swervedriver album (after mezcal head and before 99th dream) i have to say...it is a touch mellower than mezcal head but overall quite excellent. some of the sogs drag a bit and some just dont quite come together all the way (like 'i am superman') but songs like 'son of jaguar e' pull up the slack nicely. if nothing else buy the cd for 'the birds' that song is more than worth the $29.95. ""in a moment of weakness, i'm caught with a sickness...and when everyone winds me up i just cant wind down"" true true. if you're a swervedriver fan and have all the other albums and singles, pick this one up, you wont be disappointed"
5,This movie is Awesome!,"I adore this MOVIE! I think you will like it too. You and/or your family have lots of fun browsing through the Special Features, or the ""Upgrades"" I like the way that they put you in the movie when you aren't watching it. Bye..."
2,It was alright,"I don't usually buy cartoon DVD's but the last few that I have seen were funny and really good. I bought Robots because I am a HUGE Robin Williams and Halle Berry fan so I just knew that it was going to be great. But when I watched it, there were only a few funny scenes, and then the rest were just okay. I think that this one was only worth 2 stars because of Robin Williams and Halle Berry's acting. Otherwise, I could've left this one on the shelf and waited till it came on HBO or any of those cable channels."
1,"Robots:Rated ""D"" For Dumb","From the director of Ice Age comes a stupid,nauseating,unoriginal metal fairytaleabout an average robot defeating some random marketing villan and winning theheart of a girl and the respect of his friends.Sound familiar?Beneath it's ""shiny""metal exterior is a dull,pointless movie that even my little sister hated.I won't give away the sickening plot but I do have a few things to say.I mean what is the pointthey're trying to make anyway?Massmarketing is evil?Shine no matter what you're made of?Or maybe there is no point.The director obviously used some cheap moviemaking recipe and made some stupid movie that tries to please kidswith some crude fart jokes and a robot with a big butt.How this movie made it into theaters remains a mystery.Thanks for reading my review.By:AntiCritic"
1,honest,"The beginning is good, where the boy robots gets the girls parts and has to wear them but after that the movie goes downhill. Oh and Halle Berry only has like two lines! I felt ripped off!"
3,No Original Case,"Movie was in great shape for a used product, but I expected the original case to be included in the purchase. I received the movie in an alternative case with none of the original artwork or advertising. I was a little dissapointed as I had ordered this as a replacement for a scratched disk that we owned and would have kept the original case if I had known it wasn't coming. All in all the experience was ok, but I've learned to keep that in mind when ordering used movies (and keep the original case until the replacement movie is received)."
1,Damaged Goods,This item was falling apart when I received it. I asked for a partial refund so I could replace the disc case. The Seller become very hostile and challenged me to open a case. I opened and A-z case and I was refunded the full amount. He then began to call me a liar and talk bad about me and my son. He stated I was going to resale this item. Buyers beware. Your working with a very mean and hostile Seller. He broke the rules under Amazon's policy and put bad reviews under my Seller account to destroy me. Amazon stated he broke the rules. But they just slapped him on the hand. And told him not to do it again. If you want to get a refund good luck. The seller will fight you to the end. His always right never wrong. Very rude seller. My son is sick. I sale for a good cause.
2,"Lame plot, Robin Williams is not funny, poorly written","I was expecting a Pixar quality movie, you know, where adults are entertained as well? They tried - and failed. There can be only so many lame big-butt, fat rear, huge trunk jokes. The first was cute. The second lame. The 20th pathetic. The animation, while good, was not Pixar quality. It seemed flat. Sorry I purchased the DVD. IF you're purchasing it for a brain-dead adult, or a kid under the age of 8, you're all set.Too bad that was not the intended target. Robin williams is not even close to being funny. He's annoying. ""Shut up already"" was all I could think whenever he opened his mouth. We're all tired of the SAME voices he's used in every movie and stand up routine for decades. Sure they were entertaining, in an idiot-savant way, in the 90's. No longer.Every Bot's voice was poorly cast, with the lone exception of Mel Brooks."
3,Cute,"Robots is a really sweet and cute movie. It was actually funny. I for one hated Ice Age, so this movie was a real pleasure. Williams is hilarious, like his normal self. Great voices, a simple story, and an enjoyable movie."
3,"It's No ""Ice Age""","I was really looking forward to this film. ""Ice Age"" is one of my favorite movies. I was ecstatic when my son, almost 4, decided he wanted to watch it everyday for weeks. I sat with him each time it was on. When I first read about ""Robots"" I couldn't wait.I was THOROUGHLY disappointed. I didn't care about the characters, who never really grew or changed.The jokes that I felt in ""Ice Age"" were timeless, were non-existent in this movies. The subtle animation (e.g., guilty downward glances, pauses in steps) to convey emotion was also missing.Even with all the noise and colors, my four-year old son didn't like it.Sadly, I was very disappointed."
3,"Not The Best Movie, But Not The Worst Either","I saw Robots not to long ago, and didn't expect much from it (honestly), and it was actually better than I thought it would be, but not that great. Not nearly as good as Shrek or The Incredibles or those other CG Animated movies."
4,My son loved it,"In such DVDs, what matters the most is my son, as I usually purchase these movies for him. This one was really nice, it really attracted all the family."
5,Robots,My kids love watching this movie and can recite it line for line! Your kids will love watching this too!
5,Love it!!,"My one year old runs up and stands against the tv to dance any time they have a musical number on this cartoon. The music is so lively and fun, not to mention, Robyn Williams is hilarious. A joy to watch, especially for parents wary of having to sit through a cartoon"
2,Hard to take seriously,"The CGI animation is smooth and some of the scenes are funny, but this movie derailed almost immediately from the start. It starts off cute, but this is not a movie for little kids! Aunt Fanny is a ridiculous character with too many butt jokes - I would have actually given the movie another star if not for Aunt Fanny. For a movie that centers entirely on robots without ANY flesh and blood characters, the amount of 'potty jokes' on here is astonishing. There's only a few funny scenes, like the one where Rodney and Fender are trying to get into the Bigweld Ball disguised as a visiting royal and his personal attendant.Madame Gasket seems to me like she would be an outmode because her character design was drastically different from her son's and she was very clunky. Usually, I'm happy to enjoy these children's movies like Toy Story or Wall-E, but I cannot in good faith recommend this movie to anyone."
4,A pretty good movie...,"OK, maybe it's not as good as Finding Nemo, but it is almost as visually striking. One of the most fun things about this movie is the world it creates. It's true, the plot is a bit thin - Rodney Copperbottom comes to Robot City to live out his dream of becoming an inventor and must fight an evil corporation. However, there are enough jokes and pop-culture references to keep things moving along briskly. A lot of the criticism of the film centers on Robin Williams doing his same old thing. Well, I like Robin Williams's routine and I didn't find it boring. I don't think that any little children will find it boring either."
1,No more movies,I ordered two of these movies for my grandson (one for my house and one for his house) for his birthday on Feb 23. Both movies have since messed up when he was watching. This is the same problem we were having with the one we bought in the store but he loves this movie so I order more. Never again. DEFECTIVE production I suppose.
2,A fusion of Jazz and Punk : Junk,"They are selling 'junk' to your kids on the street?The Robin Williams dialog doesn't redeem this heartchilling comedy.People as robots that you can throw away when their parts fail:what message does this send to the children?A movie for children that says they will be ""recycled""when they get old as spare parts:all this bundled as cutsie animation.Yes, they are making war robots for the future,but a world of robot people is probably fantasy.No one in Hollywood seems to have heard of Asimovwhen they make this kind of trash movie?I don't like it even with a happy ending."
2,For Kids Only,"Defintely one for the kids. When you get down to it, they are just a bunch of robots, so who cares if they solve their problems or not. Humor is on kid-level."
2,so generic its not even funny,"ugg...this movie was really run of the mill. i mean, it follows the basic main character has a dream, someone beleivs in them and tells them that they can acheive anything if they beleive in themselves, main character succeeds and everythings happy sorta plot...if your going to do a movie like that, atleast make it somewhat original or above the rest! and its NOT funny! nothing clever about the jokes... just really shallow humor. the reason i gave the movie 2 stars instead of one was because of the graphics..really good graphics..but what does that matter if the movie itself isn't good?"
2,"When Robin Williams is the high point, then that IS sad.","I really wanted to like this one, but about a third of the way through, I knew it was the same old story line, the same old voices (Robin Williams) and lost interest.The picture is beautiful to look at, there is some effort, but when the laughs come from Robin one-liners, then you know what you're in for.My children liked it and laughed, so if you have children aged up to 10, I'm sure they'll enjoy it, but for us parents...not so much."
5,Fun movie!,"Robin Williams is a HIT in this movie! Need I say more? Seriously, though, I didn't have high expectations for it. (I hadn't known he was in it before I watched it either.) My 2 1/2 year old son loves robots lately, so I thought, ""let's try out this new movie."" I rented it and just had to buy it. Great movie! Clever, well-drawn, well-thought-out, great color, great action, funny!!! A delight! We try to keep our DVD collection small and rent a lot - but this was one we need to keep in our collection."
3,Won't play on my xbox,"We use our xbox as our dvd player. I guess because they added an extra feature to the dvd (an xbox game), it won't play the actual dvd on the xbox. Haven't ever had this problem with a dvd. Should be a warning or disclosure."
1,Movie will not play on some TV's,The copy protection on this DVD will not work with most DVD players and TV sets. The movie fades from dark to light and dark etc. etc. No need to buying this movie it will not play thanks to copy protection on the DVD player. Rent it first. I'm returning this movie in the when I get up.
1,what the hell is this crap! by anthony m jones,"I for one am a great fan of family movies but with this one I will make an exception.We've ,im sure at one time or another seen robot movies this is no exception except for the fact its animated and childish. I was not amused by it and you probably will feel the same way. I can see right through its famous line up of movie stars. They've got the voice talents of huge stars like Mel brooks and Robin williams but don't let that leed you away from the fact THAT THE MOVIE SUCKS!!!!!!.The story line is played out and the characters personalites are too. The creators of this also created ICEAGE,which was a good movie but this is just awwwwwwwwwffffffuull.Trust me and at least wait for it to leave theaters to rent it , you'll be happy that you didn't waste any money on this crap-O-rama. I felt confident that creators of iceage would make another hit movie like iceage but this was a total let down.PLEASE MAKE THE NEXT MOVIE YOU MAKE BE A GOOD ONE."
3,ok movie,I wasn't that thrilled w/ it but the kids seemed to like it... The best part was Robin Williams and Amanda Bynes
3,Good for Kids...,"but adults probably need to look elsewhere. There are some good lines, but overall the story comes across as trying too hard in spite of its creative vision of the future. Unless you're enamored of the animation, I'd pass on this one. It gets a ""meh"" from me."
3,"Occassionally Funny, but Trivial","A lighthearted, occassionally funny film that suffers from a simple plotline and an one-joke premise. Robin Williams is OK, but (I can't believe I'm saying this) insufficiently manic. CGI does look great--what better arena for its shiny surfaces than robots?Good for young kids, but anyone over 13 will be bored."
3,I WAS WANTING MORE OUT OF THIS!!!!!!!,"Robots i have to say was a little disappointed with it,because i didn't feel that the actors in it shouldn't have been in it!!!!! I think that this movie is only worth seeing one time,but i wouldn't own this movie at all!!!!!!!"
4,Stands the Test of Time,"Children's movies really deserve to be reviewed twice--the first time by movie critics when they first come out, and then later by parents who have to sit through multiple viewings of the film when it's released on DVD. Some movies--like ""The Incredibles"" and ""Beauty and the Beast""--stand the test of time. Others don't.""Robots"" is a film that received lukewarm reviews from theater critics. Now that I've seen the movie perhaps ten times with my kids, I can happily report that this is one of those films that stands up to repeated viewing. Robin Williams is fresh and funny, the plot is reasonably compelling, and there are always those little touches that keep you smiling. I recommend it for your home library."
4,Good not Great,"I enjoyed this movie with my son. He was entertained throughout, especially by Aunt Fanny. Some of the humor seemed a little adult in nature, though it was way above most children's heads. The computer animation is sharp, though not of the same level as Finding Nemo. The voice acting was good, though Robin Williams seemed a little subdued. It was a good effort and a fine film, just not at the very top with some of the Pixar films."
3,Great Movie,"(This movie's about a robot named Rodney Copperbottom who wants to see a man named Bigweld because he invented a dish-cleaner. But bigweld is replaced with a villian who wants to destroy robots to make new ones. It's up to Rodney, Fender, Piper, and all there friends to stop him!) This movie is great for children and grown ups. I escpecially like the character Aunt Fanny (voiced by Jennifer Coodlige). There's also Amanda Bynes (Piper), Fender (Robin Williams), Bigweld (Mel brooks, and lots more. Go see this movie as soon as you can if it's still in theaters."
4,Very unique,"I really thought this movie was gonna be a cheezy kids movie so I was not expecting much. But I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. There are a lot of metaphors and sexual jokes that younger children won't get, but teens and adults will laugh at. So it balances the humor for all ages. The whole robot world and how they interact and live was really unique, the writers of the movie had very good imaginations. It's a visually stunning film and I think all the right actors were chosen, Jay Leno plays a trash can.. haha. Me and my friend laughed throughout the movie and I will probably purchase the dvd when it is released. Overall a good film for all ages, sure there have been better (Toy Story), but it's worth checking out."
3,Really a 3.5,"Took my son to this movie...who I have to say did not want to see this film, suprisingly her really enjoyed it!!! He wanted to go see the Pacifier....anyway, I found this film to have a decent story line, but in some spots it seemed to drag...honestly. There was a few spots were I actually fell asleep..ZZZZ....It did have some really cute and funny parts in it as well...Robin Williams did an excellent job in the film!!! If I were u...I would rent this one, and not take the extra cash to see it in the theaters....IMHO"
2,So-So,Robots wasn't as good as I thought it would. From the previews it looked pretty good. First off it is too short but for an animated kids film I guess I can understand. The film was cute but it wasn't all that funny. The voice talents are good especially Robin Williams but the overall film to me just wasn't all that good.
1,this is realllllllllllllllly dumb!,"(...)this is bad animation it looks like a 1980 cartoon. dont go see it. look at the poster and zoom in... told ya, it has bad animation"
1,THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!!!!,THIS MOVIE IS HORRIBLE AND IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY! DON'T LISTEN TO EVERYBODY ELSE!!!!!!!! UNLESS THEY SAY IT IS BAD!!!!! AND IT IS NOT FUNNY AT ALL!!!!!!! THE JOKES ARE PATHETIC!!!!!!
2,"SOOO think your smart, eh?","The story for the dumb film is this:Roddney is born and goes on a quest to meet a robot who can make anything. Along the way he fonds a red robot, a green, a yellow (And, so and so.) He must battle a Ceo.The main problem with this film is that its just a dull story.Heck, Compared to ice age, this is scrap."
5,"Liked it, then loved it!","First time I saw Robots I was unimpressed. Then I had kids. We got this for my four year old to watch. He *loves* it, and I have to admit it's grown on me too.And there's a lot to love. The movie holds up very well to repeat viewing. The world has an incredible amount of detail, with lots of subtleties you don't notice the first dozen times. The plot is reasonably good, the voice acting is great, and it's got a nice pick-me-up moral. Even better, it's got some humor which will appeal to the adults without corrupting the children.The plot in a nutshell: Rodney Copperbottom grows up poor, with big dreams of becoming an inventor. Once he's grown up, he goes to the big city to meet his idol, Bigweld, the greatest robot in the world. But, Bigweld has disappeared, and his company is being run by an evil corporate executive! What will Rodney do?If you've got a kid, it's worth buying this movie. This widescreen DVD has excellent quality encoding, and holds up to repeat plays."
5,BEAUTIFUL LOOKING FUNNY MOVIE!,This is such a beatiful looking movie that I don't know if it matters that it is also a very good movie too. The animation is amazing and will have you checking out every little detail. The story is funny and moves along at a good pace. The DVD is an excellent transfer and this is a must have for family viewing.
4,Funny movie,"5 year old son loved it as did I. Great humor, loved the comedy. Going to buy this one for the collection."
5,Real treat for the imagination,"I got into the robot characters through Xtranormal.com, which is a video-making site. Lots of Youtubers like me (brainouty) use it. Pity that Xtranormal then changed its policies, so the videos are now too hard to make. So you just dream about making them, now.So dream via this movie. Its characters are much the same-looking, and the whole movie is first-rate in every respect, from witty script and animation, to voiceovers, to film editing, to plot. It's really too fast and too clever for one viewing, so you'll want to buy it and watch it many times, as I will. A++++ to everyone.Like every animated film and sci-fi book, this one has socio-political meanings we all know, but for some reason the story never gets old. Here, the same theme is wonderfully told. Will cheer your day, even if you watch only five minutes."
3,Was there a story here?,"""Robots"" is the latest computer animated feature film from the creators of Ice Age. Like many films of the same genre, ""Robots"" offers a new artistic style and a large cast of voice talents. However ""Robots"" is more of a sight to see than a movie-going experience to fully enjoy.""Robots"" is a movie with heart, what do you expect for a movie targeted for a family audience. It also had some funny moments, and, as expected, were mostly contributed to Robin's robot character. There were also little details that achieved good laughs... Robot City wouldn't be complete without a robot doing the robot. It can be really funny, but other times it tries a bit hard. What Robots lacked was ironically originality. It was a good attempt, but ultimately ""Robots"" is sadly recycled scrap metal."
3,letdown,"after the excellent ""Ice Age"" from this studio, I was really looking forward to ""Robots"".the 3D is excellent and the story starts off very promising (scene where they ""make a baby"" with parts), but quickly dissipated into...well, something that didn't hold my attention.the first sign this movie was going downhill was that stupid Jack-in-the-Box character that guards the main city gates. The animators must have beeen so desperate for footage that they refused to edit that long winded, unnecessary scene.dissapointing to say the least"
3,A little pedestrian,"I find myself saying what I say about many films these days: I love the visuals, but the story is a bit pedestrian.This highlights what is so great about Pixar movies. (Monsters Inc, The Incredibles, Toy Story.) ""Robots"" is literal and obvious all the time. Take the title: ""Robots"". It is literal. The story mainly consists of ""robot jokes"". Jokes just based on the fact that the characters are robots. Pixar would have made far less obvious jokes. And they would have made the characters much more interesting, not cardboard. Sorry, tin plate.Finally, ""Robots"" signals all its messages in huge, shining letters. When the characters have a ""touching"" moment, their face lights up in close-up, and ""uplifting"" movie music plays. Pixar movies don't hit the audience over the head.Maybe I'll finish the film yet, since the visuals are so wonderful, and it does have the occasional amusing moment. And then maybe I'll rewatch The Incredibles."
1,HO HO OH NO!,"SINCE I PAID FULL PRICE FOR THIS CLUNKER, I MADE MYSELF READ IT. INJECTED WITH A BIT MORE REALISM,COULD HAVE BEEN A CUTE STORY. I LIKED THE PREMISE OF THE TRAVELING SANTA BUS VISITING THE HOMELESS SHELTERS AND GIVING SOME HOLIDAY SPIRIT TO THOSE LESS FORTUNATE, BUT SO MUCH OF THE ""LOVE"" SCENES WERE UNBELIEVABLE IT WAS HARD TO PLOW THRU!"
3,Thick material but watch for shrinking,"I bought two pairs of these sweats. One is fine today, the other experienced shrinkage in one leg of nearly 2 inches!!!! Also, fairly baggy in their cut. The material is very thick though, probably moreso that most comparable products out there."
5,A true achievement.,"This music impresses the sheer heck out of me. Notwithstanding they are a husband/wife team who obviously take great care to perfect their art. If I lost this CD I would cry, then recover and order another two."
2,"No steering, overpriced.","I bought this for an arduino project, the car has no steering capabilities unless you jimmy rig it, which I haven't done yet. While it was fun assembling the whole car, every little part, it would be much more worth your while to buy a cheap remote control car if you're doing anything real with it."
3,Hard Fall hard to put down!,"This is the first Pearson book I have read and found the book hard to put down. Each chapter was a rush. At times a bit ""far fetched"" however exciting enough to keep me reading on. Many twist and turns in the story make for a wild ride and a race to the finish line. Worth the read!!"
2,Not Up To The Author's Standard,The hero detective chases a man who booby traps airplanes and causes crashes. Maybe this is a more true-to-life story than most I've read since the hero's girlfriend is seduced by the villian and the end of the story tells you that the bad guy may well get away with his depredations - BUT - I get enough of that kind of disillusion in real life. I don't need it in my fiction where the good guy is supposed to win and the evil twisted genius is supposed to be punished. Pearson writes real well; he just didn't write a book that I liked.
2,not a good concealed holster,"This holster fits too loosely on your belt, making it less than ideal for concealed carry. With as loosely as it fit i would not be very comfortable carrying my weapon at all. Gun fit nicely in the holster itself, holster just flopped around too much on my side."
3,Healing Your Family Tree,"I didn't care much for the Question & Answer format. It would have been fine if half of the book or less contained the Q&A's. The answers were so extensive that it made the organization of the book hard to follow. The author would have been better served by laying out the foundation of his arguments in the first 3 or 4 chapters. Overall there is a lot of wisdom in this book; however, it is presented in such a way that it may be hard to stomach for the less-than-devout Catholics, or gnostics and mystics of various traditions."
3,Disappointed,Cover was shabby. It has worn pages too. I have purchased used books before and have been satisfied by their condition. But not this book.
2,Dissapointed,These guys did a great cover of communication breakdown on the sucking the 70's disc. Unfortunateley they arent as good as Zeppelin with there own music. Just didnt care for these guys
4,Awesome Book!,"This is an awesome book! It spans a 100 year time frame and does a good job of mixing in relevant pieces of real history. If the main character in this book (Rose Dunmore) is not someone in the authors family than she has an incredibly creative mind. I really enjoyed the spiritual Bible references and the good ole' fashioned down-home common sense that Rosa dished out in abundance. The authentic language was also a nice touch. Bravo, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it for a book club read! -ES"
4,Versatile instrument,"This omnichord has more options than I could have ever imagined. I'm still at the simple stage of playing, though. The only thing I am disappointed about, is that almost invariably, at some point in my playing, it begins to play other notes than what I am pressing, going sharp or flat and wreaking havoc with my practice. It's in a controlled environment, so it is not the humidity or changing temps that can be affecting it. Nor does it matter whether I'm plugged in to AC or DC. It can get ""temperamental."""
4,Magnet is a bit weak,"Nice quality ground clamp, but it needs a 100% contact area for the magnet to pull the contact finger all the way flat. If you attempt to clamp onto a corner, bar or other shape that doesn't give the circle of the magnet full coverage, the magnet will not sit flush. Makes for an electrode that will move around or fall off if the ground wire has even the smallest amount of pull on it."
1,Misleading,"Dont buy album. The album cover is misleading, it's not a funeral for a friend album. It's a promotional album featuring only one funeral song, the rest are from different artists."
2,Corrs,"Forgot how ""dry"" and botingly simulare their music could be, a couple goodsongs, but sound tracks and voice is too much the same."
3,should have waited for borrowed heaven.,This album is really a must have but it could have been better if they had waited for borrowed heaven to be realeased and include its hits into the 'Best Of'. But still a must have for any Corrs fan!!
1,Not enough good material for a 'Best of',"I was dissapointed with this album. I'm not terribly familiar with the band but I got this CD as a present. If I knew the shop where it was bought I'd be tempted to bring it back. As a huge fan of Irish music (especially anything by the Cranberries and U2), it annoys me to see bands like this try to tag along on their coattails."
4,"Review of ""People Smart""","Greetings from downunder: People Smart is a blessing in disguise. As a counsellor (Marriage & relationships) it is great to be able to ""Read"" & ""Treat"" people the way they want to be treated. By applying the ""Platinum Rule"" in everyday situations I have found that it has help me to make friends and keep them. Business wise it also helps in negotiations and reasoning with salespeople etc. This a must read for people in all walks of life. Great book. Harold"
5,Great book for preparing your toddler for flight!,I purchased this book for my son a few years ago to prepare him for his first flight on an airplane. It really helped teach my child what to expect - I highly recommend it!
3,Great Photos... fluffy content,"I absolutely loved the Pinkeys' book, Shades of Black. It really gives children an understanding of the varying physical characteristics among Blacks, lends a positive vocabulary, and gives children someone to identify with.This spin-off just recycles the ideas of Everybody's Beautiful and The World is a Rainbow. There is a poster child for each ethnicity and an association with a color. The children are pictured wearing their color... not by stereotype.This book is cute enough, but it is pretty fluffy."
4,Great salsa dvd.,"This was a great salsa dvd. The music was upbeat for dancing in parties, and night clubs. It was professionally made. Fruko knows the beat of salsa."
5,A must have for all robbie's hardcore fans,"These double DVDs contain almost all his hits LIVE from his first album ""life thru a lens"" to the first single ""Rudebox"" of his latest album ""Rudebox"".The only flaw of the DVDs is the interactive menu, it's kinda not so user friendly, and both DVDs have a different interactive format, in addition no track list on the back cover, and this really sucks.Other than that i think it should be a have must for all Robbie's fans out there....."
1,Depressing,"I'm not sure what makes the other reviewers say good things about this album, making me buy it. This CD is terrible, boring, and depressing. Voice is ok, but the songs are not worth listening to. Check out Karla Bonoff instead."
3,Worthy addendum,"Decent stop gap after Beam's back-porch debut finds the hushed acoustic player slightly refining his muddled aesthetics into songs a tad more compelling, but still presents this laid back brief collection without overstepping Creek's modest goals."
3,Marginal effort from a great perfromer,"Not nearly as melodic, or as interesting an effort as several others from this great performer. Nonetheless, after giving this effort 3 our of 5 star review initially, this is an interesting album that just takes longer to grow on the listener."
1,junk,"I love Creek drank the Cradle but this is pure junk. Jesus the Mexican boy is simply pathetic. Why, why was this released?"
2,"Henry Wallace, Harry Truman, and the Cold War","Walton's book is meant to be a vigorous defense of Henry Wallace and the Far Left during the 40's and 50s. But, intended or not, what Walton inadvertently reveals is that Wallace was a pompous fool. If not a ""fellow traveler,"" then he was one of the ""useful idiots"" on the left that Lenin laughed about. Wallace is revealed as so pro-Soviet as to be blind to the true nature of totalitarian communism, naive to the point of being dangerous and reckless, arrogant and haughty, and driven by passions the author does not want to delve into. The book also reveals, inadvertently, the duplicity of intellectuals on the left and the stars of the entertainment world who, knowingly or not, were essentially working on behalf of Stalin. This is the huge dirty secret the Left continues to lie about, distort, and suppress. Walton's attempt to defend Wallace and the left backfired admirably."
4,Almost Everything,"I love this case and don't want a different one. The removable motherboard tray was even more helpful and easy to use than the other reviews had implied.The one and only complaint i have is that some of the hardware i was transfering in wasnt as high-end as the case makers assumed it would be.There was no way (without modding or purchasing extra hardware) for me to connect an IDE hardrive and a dvd-rom on one cable. I took out my drill and fixed the problem, but i wasnt planning on modding this case for quite a while.With top end hardware this would have been the best case i ever purchased, but because i was transfering a few components my life was made harder than i anticipated briefly.If you have a SATA hd then this is setup perfectly. I worked around it and am exceptionally happy with this case. This is the most happy i have ever been with a computer case."
4,Nice but smaller than older.,"Well, Nice looking case, very very light, is Aluminum. I had this case before and I get a new one, but the dimensions are not the same. The old ULTRA CASE ALUMINUS BLACK HIGH GLOSS CASE had the follow dimensions :10.43 X 20 X 23 but this one are smaller. 10 X 21 X 19...Sad, very SAD....Shipping was very fast."
2,not the fabric I was expecting,"This shower curtain is pretty, but I was disappointed in the fabric. It is really sheer and synthetic looking. I even had to get a thicker, solid white liner to go behind it so that you couldn't see into the shower. The ruffles are pretty, but it's not as nice looking as in the photo."
3,shower curtain,"Shower curtain arrived in timely manner. The ruffles were torn in several places. I was able to repair them , but was disappointed. The curtain is very sheer which we did not want and solved by using a white fabric curtain behind it."
3,On the Fence,"I'm on the fence about keeping this curtain. I love the ruffles which look shabby chic but hate the sheerness of the fabric. I wasn't sure how sheer this would be....so let me tell you, you can see right thru it and all the other reviews about its sheerness are true. I do have a white Martha Stewart liner behind it which works and prevents you from seeing thru it. I will probably keep it for a year or two while I find one that's 100% cotton with the same look. The ruffles on the picture are accurate but the picture does not show its sheerness, so don't be fooled."
1,Looks awful,"This shower curtain looks awful! Its not fabric at all- its very cheap, very sheer garbage. I wish I hadn't bought this and now I'm going to have to spend the $$$ to send it back. Seriously, this thing doesn't look like the picture at all. What it does look like is crap."
3,It's thin and shiny!,"Thinner and shinier than I expected from the photograph, anyways. Not all of the hanger slots were opened all the way, so I had to force some of the hangers through the holes. It made my bathroom look cleaner and more put together, but I'm still a little bit disappointed that it doesn't look like the photo as much as I'd hoped."
4,Very nice,I like this shower curtain. It is girly and feminine. The quality is good and the curtain is pretty. I like it. Would recommend.
5,terrific - I use for people with mid-stage alzheimer's,"This is a terrific video for people who have alzheimer's disease and like to see flowers, watch butterflies. It is videos of hundreds of different flower types in a natural garden setting with butterflies often in the video also. You can choose ""with"" or ""without"" the flower ID info on the screen (turn on only if person is mild cognitive impairment or early stage alzheimer's and they really like to read those IDs, turn off for everyone else with dementia). Then you choose from four different background audio: natural sounds, relaxing guitar music, Vivaldi music, and Classical selections - all are calm and relaxing. This video will run 2 hours if you choose play all, terrific for background or watching by person with alzheimer's who is facscinated with gardens, flower, moving insects.....very nice."
5,Great for kids of all ages!,"I received this DVD as a baby shower gift for my first child. He is now 16 months old, and this is the only DVD he wants to watch. He absolutely adores it! He will sit for the entire length (about 45 minutes) completely captivated. My husband and parents and I all really like it too. It is so relaxing to watch. The music is wonderful, and the colors of the trains and other toys are vibrant and fun. We may need to buy another copy of it since ours is already skipping in places from watching it so much! I highly recommend this DVD for model train aficionados and kids of all ages!"
5,pennywise -from the ashes,from the ashes is pennywise at their best. the drummer is amazing and has the best sound to his drums than any other band. i highly recomend this cd!
5,FREAKING AWSOME,"THIS CD RULES BUY IT, i listen to it non stop, it is just as good as ""about time"" and ""straight ahead"" if not better. to any one who knows and likes punk rock then they should get it because it comebinds everything from fast drumming and chord progressions to individual styles of bass and guitar the lyrics are great and meaningful to everyone so check it out"
2,Not so great,"I've been a huge fan of Pennywise since I was a lot younger. But this is the album that has weened me off them.I don't know what Jim and the boys have done but it all sounds so clean and boring. The only song that comes close to firing me up in the way they used too is Punch Drunk. I think this album, and The Fuse were seriously let down in the mixing process. It just doesn't have that Pennywise edge any more."
5,af**kingmazing,"pennywise, my god...these guys have been around a long time and have completely defined the term ""punk"" as not just a style of clothing, but a way of life....sticking up for yourself and doing good for yourself, reaching your goals...and knowing the truth about our government and not falling into their traps...positive, up-lifting, mind shattering riffs with beautiful words...ha, brings me back to the old days of pennywise-with a little bit of a new edge. unbelievable these guys can still rock it out better than anyone else!!"
4,Good album....Land of the Free part 2?,"This album reminds me of another Land of the Free. Some excellent songs, some good songs and some I could live without. I wish the guitar had more edge to it...It seems a little soft. And too much strumming, not enough palm mutting. Otherwise, a good disc."
2,"Dissapointing, lacks signature Pennywise energy","This CD does NOT deserve the 5 star rating, more like 2 or 2.5. I listened to it the first week i got it and havent touched it since.The best things about Pennywise is their awesome guitar riffs, loud complex drums, and pure energy, unfortunately this CD has none of those. To see what i mean listen to Land of The Free, About Time, or Full Circle, all A+ class records! Like others have said Jim sounds bored, and the guitars are really dull. Also, they made some great rock songs on LOTF but instead of changing and doing new things like they were with Land of The Free, they recreated their old stuff minus the energy and guitar/drum skills with this record.Bottom line: only a couple decent songs, skip this and get About Time, then Land of The Free, then Full Circle, and see why Pennywise truely rocks!"
4,Good CD,"I got this CD because I went to the Tony Hawk's Underground website and they had ""Now I Know"" playing. Then I bought it. It's really cool. A couple flaws, but still cool. ""God Save The USA"" is sorta like a NOFX song cuz NOFX hates the president. Good. ""Something To Change"" is the best song on the CD. I downloaded ""Waiting"" from here also before I bought the CD. That's awesome. The rest of the CD is pretty good. Buy this CD."
5,Truly worth the wait,The latest release from Pennywise had much publicity about it in the weeks and months leading to its release. The claims were true. The album is truly a must buy for all who have ever enjoyed a Pennywise song. True Pennywise fans will definitely not be disappointed with this little gem. It is definitely a must buy!
5,extreme-to the max,By far the best album to come from pennywise yet. I dont know what i would do without it. Pennywise rocks.
5,RISE UP!!,"Following up Land of the Free with this political gem, Pennywise proves that after 15 years, they're still the best. While the messages in their two newest cds is quite different from their earlier music, it's no less serious, and they continue to stay atop the punk rock scene. From the Ashes is a great cd, rivaling even Full Circle. Too bad Jason isn't around to see them now; he'd be proud."
4,STILL GOING STRONG,"Unlike some of my other favorite bands (AFI,rancid) pennywise hasn't sold out their label or their sound .Their message is still stronger than ever and their music is still sounding the same, and it sounds great! Im a big p.w. fan and ill continue to be.....keep on rockin guys."
5,Pennywise is still one of the best,"From The Ashes is one of my favorite albums, it's definately worth buying, even though it isn't that cheap.""From the Ashes"" stays action packed through the whole album, it has a great opener which is followed up by ""God save the USA"" which is also a great song. Soon after that is 'waiting', which I think is the best song on the album, and then the rest of the songs which are really cool also.The album has a couple weak points, I think one of them is ""this is a test"", I think it's a really boring song.I was also disappointed that there weren't as many great guitar solos as there are on 'full circle', so if that's what you're interested in maybe pick up that album first.This album is still worth buying though, you'll enjoy it"
5,My review,"I have been a pennywise fan for about five or six years and own all 9 pennywise albums. This album is no disappointment at all! I must say I'm extremely impressed with this album lyrically and sound wise. Tracks 1-4 are probably my favorite. Best song in my opinion on this album is ""waiting"". I got a chance to see pennywise live for their cd release party and even met the band. Great guys who are very loyal to their fans. So what are you waiting for...pick up a copy of this album!"
5,doesnt disappoint,"another great cd by pennywise, same great lyrics and in your face punk. if you dont have it go and buy it. i just saw these guys live and they rock @ss so get over to one of their shows!"
5,Best PW album in a while,"While live @ key club and Land of the Free? were great albums, From the Ashes is Pennywises best album since full circle. Jims vocals speak volumes and guitar and drums provide a pleasant assault on the ears. Great album with killer dvd"
5,THE BEST ALBUM SINCE FULL CIRCLE,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PENNYWISE ALBUMS IN YEARS.IT IS FULL OF GREAT LYRICS AND MUSIC.THEY ARE ON A NEW LEVEL.
5,GREAT!!!,"The CD definetly is great! Another album with fantastic critical lyrics aginst all things being wrong in the USA, keep it going!"
4,Pennywise Kicks Bum,"Well, they just can't seem to come up with a failure. Every cd has turned out to be gold and this is not an exception. Just buy it I know you will like it."
4,::::::::: PENNYWISE DELIVERS AGAIN :::::::::,"Pennywise is one of only a few bands i will continuously go out the day of the release to get the new album. This time around I was not let down. The album has the usual loudness and quality I've come to expect from pennywise. This album should be played loud, and the recording of this album has a nice crunchy sound that sounds good, but at it's best a high volume. Every song on the album has grown on me, some faster than others, but as always, I feel there is not a single song worth skipping over on this album, from start to finish it is great stuff. As in reviews by others here and elsewhere, pennywise may come back to sounds and messages they have visited in the past, but that's what makes them a steadfast band, one you can hold on to. They talk about things that have meaning to them, and this album touches some new things including the devastation of September 11th. Plus, you get a free DVD with Fletcher puking... I think 4 times."
5,the greatest new cd out there,wow when i first heard this cd i rememer why i started to listen to pennywise..... cause the are the best they pump me upready to go riding. get theis cd its better then u think go and get it
3,12 of 13,"I use these at work and so far they work pretty decent, usually after the first use with each different one the prohold tip gets messed up, but the part that I didn't like was the set was 13 pieces and I only got 12 in the pack. I was missing the .050 one."
5,incredible,this song is so beautiful and artistic. you can really feel the emotion and the description. its poetry. its brilliance. it rarely gets better than this. thank you mars volta. thank you.
2,One of his worst 3 albums,"I don't know witch one I like least, Private Passion, Step By Step or this one. This is not what I would call good Jazz, the rest of his albums are good to great. I myself prefer the more jazz side of Jeff, but these are just my thoughts on his music. Listen before you buy, I should have. This reminds me of Disco more than Jazz, and I never liked Disco."
4,Smooth Electro Funk Madness-here and there,"I will have to deduct one star from the Jeff Lorber FusionBand's ""In The Heat Of The Night"" as it contains a fair amount of filler-mostly in lame stabs at funk-rock towards the end of the album.But the smooth groove of ""Tropical"" the Rockit-likeproto scratch funk of ""Blast Off"" are particular highlights even as the slightly forboding groove of ""Really Scarry"" andthe catchy title song explore more melodic textures.Not bad but not all it couldv'e been."
5,WONDERFUL BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My sister told me to read this book and I liked it so much, I returned the half read book to the library and bought one of my own so I could savour it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (She is right, I live in Washington, and the Olympic National Park is west of Seattle, not east as the text says.)"
5,Off the Clock,"This excellent book is about a real-life adventure that begins shortly after Melissa Walker has a dream about losing a race with time. The disturbing dream convinces Walker to short-circuit a mid-life crisis by taking a sabbatical from the clock. She sets out alone to explore America's wild places at a leisurely pace, which she calls ""wilderness time."" She hikes rugged and sometimes dangerous trails, soaks up spectacular scenery, and sleeps outdoors with mountain lions, grizzly bears, and armed poachers nearby. She meets all kinds of people, some inspiring, some quirky, and some scary, and she survives a variety of hazardous situations. She faces her fears, examines her life, ponders the complexities of the ""man and woman thing,"" and forges an intimate relationship with the environment. Her writing style is straightforward, original, and engaging. The tone of the book is optimistic without offering bumper sticker or pop-psychology solutions to complicated problems."
3,Music Man Mystery,"The primary problem I have with Music Man is its premise that Harold Hill knows nothing about music, though he dances and sings flawlessly throughout the production. Also, verse 2 of 76 Trombones is almost an exact repeat of the excellent first verse."
3,Poorly cast remake trys hard,"There are only two reasons to watch this poorly done remake of Meredith Wilson's The Music Man...Kristen Chenowith and Debra Monk, as Marian and her mother. Their performances raise this drab remake above the total disaster arena. Mathew Broderick is completely wrong for this role. Having seen him onstage in two wonderful performances, I expected him to be very good. Unfortunately, he's barely adequate. Much of the cast is too young for their roles and they aren't good enough actors to overcome this poor casting. Ms. Chenowith, however, is delightful with her wonderful singing and acting performance. Debra Monk matches her every step of the way as her pushy mother. If you want to see The Music Man done well, then get the 1962 version, but skip this one. I gave it 3 stars, only because it looks great when played."
1,Bad to the Bone!,"What were they thinking? This production was just so bad...it had no charm, no magic, and no spark. To me, The Music Man is a truly mesmerizing stage production. The Preston/Jones cast did an amazing job with it back in the 1960's. This clunker stunk from the first minute to the last. I was so disappointed, and I am certain that you will be too. The singing, dancing, everything was flat. Save your money and re-watch the original."
1,Are you Crazy?,"This version of the Music Man would make Meredith Willson turn over in his grave! I have been a BIG fan of MM for many years. I have the original film version and saw the broadway show 4 times. This TV version ought to be burned!! Craig Bierko (who did the broadway version) should have played the part for TV. He is handsome, funny and a hell of a better singer that Matthew B. He is Robert Preston reincarnated! I'm sure, somewhere, there is a video of the Broadway version and Amazon.com would be crazy not to find it."
5,Better than imagined!,"Not only was the price perfect, but the delivery was much faster than I had anticipated."
1,Trouble in this Made-for-tv movie,"As a huge fan of the original ""Music Man"", I eagerly anticipated this movie. But after about half an hour of watching it, I had to change the channel. The main problem was Matthew Broderick as Professor Higgins. I found him to be flat and boring, with none of the pizazz as in the original. Take my advice, and go for the classic."
1,Meredith Wilson is turning over in his grave!,"Chenoweth has a huge voice and she does her part, and reviving ""My White Knight"" from the stage play was a nice addition, but Matthew Broderick as Professor Harold Hill is the worst piece of casting in the history of cinema. The producer and director should go to Meredith Wilson's grave and aplogize. Simply an awful movie."
1,Skip it...!,"Meredith Wilson was a genius...his book and score of The Music Man are incomparable. This boring, badly acted remake does the almost impossible...it makes The Music Man look bad.For sheer joy, and an outstanding, joyful version of The Music Man, see Robert Preston and Shirley Jones in the 1962 film version.Skip this one...by all means."
2,Stick with Robert Preston,"Ugh. Low energy, unflattering tight shots which provide details of Ms. Chenowith's face which I'm comfortable not knowing about, including a huge bubble of saliva at the end of My White Night. The choreography is pedestrian (""walk-ography"") and there is no momentum. The original movie with Robert Preston and Shirley Jones is definitive; I would advise sticking to it. This version only points up the magnificence of Robert Preston in the original."
1,A Nightmare on Main Street,"This movie in no way can be compared with the wonderful 1962 version of the Music Man starring Robert Preston. Poorly paced, poorly written, poorly acted, and a wonderful example of why some movies should never be remade. Mathew Brodderick is non-existent in this role. He has the look of a deer caught in a cars headlights and acts as if he wants to runaway as fast as he can from this production. For anyone to say that these music and dance numbers are superior to the original is the equivalent of saying that Days Inn is better then the Ritz Carlton. No comparison! See the original and bask in its energy and joy because they are clearly lacking in this shameful remake."
1,Stinks,"What a bland performance by Broderick and other cast members. This version of the Music Man is worse than death warmed over - so badly cast that no expensive production values could save it. While the original had massive electricity, this one barely shows a pulse. I can't help but think that all the 5 star reviews are from Disney employees. What a waste of my time and their money. Truly uninspired. Merideth Wilson must be spinning.You could say I was prejudiced because my cousin was in the original Broadway version and also the movie version (as Buddy Hackett's girlfriend), and I've seen the original movie version more times than I'd like to admit. But there's more to it than that. It really is terrible."
1,Hollywood Fails Again.,Hollywood continues to try to re-make already perfect film musicals better. And more often than not they fail. With the Music Man comes another failure. Nothing good to say about this one. Bad bad casting = Matthew Broderick. I've seen actors playing Harold Hill in High School Productions shine compared to the dim portrayal by Broderick. 'Nuf sed.
1,"Hideous, Heinous, Horrible","""The Music Man"" is one of very few classic Broadway musicals that have been made into classic films. Why someone chose to remake it, to miscast virtually every role, is a mystery to me. I see that there are reviewers who like this version of ""The Music Man"", even some who prefer it to the original film. Let me put it simply: These people are idiots. If you are one of these people, then you are an idiot. Please, do yourself a favor and get the wonderful original."
2,The Music Man is a True American Classic - Despite This!,"I will admit that I'm prejudice when it comes to Robert Preston. Preston had a limited range as a singer, but more than made up for it with stage presence, knowledge of the character of Harold Hill, and great moves that dominated every scene (and he was in nearly every scene). I would be hard-pressed to find someone who would fill the man's shoes. Still, Matthew Broderick seems uncomfortable in his OWN shoes. His awkwardness and gangly movement is disconcerting for me, the viewer. I kept waiting for him to fall down! I know they cast Broderick to attract viewers with his familiar name and his reputation as a musical performer in The Producers, but it's like casting Ray Romano to play Don Corleone in The Godfather because he's Italian."
2,Much less than the sum of the parts,"What a disappointment! I needed to buy the movie and debated between the original, which I had seen before, and this, which I had not. Boy, did I make the wrong choice. I'm not a real fan of Shirley Jones, and absolutely adore Kristen Chenowith, so bought this version for that reason alone. Matthew Broderick is absolutely HORRIBLE in this production. Absolutely no charm or energy, with awkward movement and bland, uh, everything. Kristen is, of course, a MAJOR musical theatre talent, but even she can't escape the horrible costumes, direction and cinematography. Victor Garber and Molly Shannon are also wonderful actors, but are horribly miscast, so none of their lines make any sense or have any impact. The Music Man is a bravely unique, brilliant piece of musical theatre. You absolutely must see it. Just do it at your local community theatre or the original movie version. This dreck will ruin it for you."
2,Don't Bother,"It's a good production. . . if you've never seen ""The Music Man"" before. However, I imagine that a lot of people who grew up watching and loving the 1962 version will be disappointed, as I was. The characters' personalities and quirks (for example, Mrs. Paroo's accent, Mayor Shinn's speeches, and of course, Harold Hill) never felt over-the-top enough."
1,Don't Bother. Interferrance on this item is horrible.,I had great hopes in buying this item to run it underneath my carpet.Ran it underneath and got horrible interference.Don't even bother buying one. You'll want to return it.
2,kiddo,"I used Yahoo to see about this book initially. Wow, out of 9 reviews two gave it 5 stars but oddly had the same 4 words ""I liked this book"" and nothing more. The rest were a single star with one 3 star. Lots of misspellings and incorrect grammer, or just plain jibberish (the three star one was just a joke, I take it). I looked here to see if I could get any more than just one person saying they liked this book. I liked getting her past reviews for free on Yahoo earlier in 2007, but now they are hoping for book sales and won't let you look at her opinions for anything that is not recently playing. Because of this I was tempted to buy, but at $30+, I'm waiting to hear a lot more positive feedback before I purchase this item."
4,A good read for those with a taste for true history,"I was first drawn to this book because I had known and worked with Mr. Sam Young, Sr., the 'Sun Country Banker, during the last decade of his life. I found it to be a very interesting biography that did a good job of documenting the life and accomplishments of an exceptional individual. Although I am not sure that any book can capture the true charisma, dynamics and sphere of influence of one of the most remarkable gentleman I have ever known, it does an excellent job of providing personal insite into the man and the community he loved. I highly recommend the book, especially to all Texans and El Pasoans who have a interest in their state and local history and heros."
4,For the Smallville fan,Can't get enough Smallville? These companion guides tell you everything you wanted to know and more. Lots of detail. I'd like to see more interviews though. Especially with Welling.
4,Solid entry in the line,"Titan Books pretty much has the formula down. The Smallville series are short on synopses and long on cast and creator commentary, and so are interesting reading for any fan of the series. The color plates are usually the standard promo shots from the given season, but the review of the season arcs and the in-depth look at every finale make the books certainly worth reading, and the cast interviews are always fun."
5,"Great Range, Great Sound, Great Product","Unit works very well. Inexpensive dual micrphone unit. Handheld mic is a little on the heavy side. Clarity and Range are there. Dual XLR outputs & 1 1/4"" combined output."
1,John Paul Pet JPT05 Rubber Circle Toy,"This product sucks, I bought 1 for my dog to play with and in less than 2 minutes he had chewed it into as far as I'm concerned this product was a waste of money. So don't waste yours."
2,not too good,If your dog/puppy is a big chewer avoid this. My 7 mos old 12 lb puppy broke the spikes off this and easily ate it. It is more of a hard plastic and not like a rubber tire.
4,Castle Waiting is wonderful!,"I have been a fan of Castle Waiting and Linda Medley for years. I was so excited to see this compilation. She is an amazing storyteller with very lovable characters. She has a wonderful wit and sense of humor in her storytelling. Two-thirds of this collection are previously published graphic novels, The Brambley Hedge and The Lucky Road. I was a little disapointed that there was not more ""new"" material in this collection. However the last third is a wonderful story involving Sister Peace a nun with a most unusual order. Sister Peace's story is so fun and a beautiful tribute to friendship and rebellious women that it is worth the price of the whole book just for this story line. I hope others who enjoy this book know that the story continues and you can buy more Castle Waiting from the publisher."
3,Well...,"I thought this looked like such a neat book. The drawings were clean and expressive, the writing was playful and fresh. But I was left wondering...well...what next?!Almost half of the book is devoted to telling Sister Peace's story and so you never hear the histories of most of the other characters, the doctor, for instance. Seriously, what HAPPENED to that guy?I thought, going into it, that this was going to focus on Lady Jain, but even her story is incomplete. Does she ever confront her husband? Do we ever find out if the little boy she was betrothed to grew up to be her husband or her sweetheart?And what about Rackham? He just shows up at the castle one day and is made the new steward, but we never learn what brought him to the castle.Am I missing something? Are their going to be more installments? Please, someone let me know!"
4,Nice Fairytail graphic novel.,"Borrowed a copy from my kids who got it from the library, and set down for an evening read. It's very similar tales to your classic tales Grimm. However it feels like VOL 1, and while the stories within the world are complete, it feels like there are many more to come. Which is a good thing.It's a nice alternative from the heavy dark/violent stuff that seems to be most of the Graphic Novel books these days. The order of the Nuns is a nice variation of the theme on beauty and personal value.In addition the women characters are generally strong and not some bunch of whinnying ninnies. So all in all recommended for early teens."
5,"document, great names and..they do it again!!!!","This is a document, a rarity, collector's item ánd ofcourse a joy for the ear!Historical recordings, livethings. NICE!!"
3,Cute,"My baby granddaughter stayed focused for a long time, so I'd say it is ok. If it could hold her attention for the full length and then have her say ""again"" it would be five stars. :-)"
1,Horrible Quality and Terrible Graphics,"I purchased this DVD as I saw some really great reviews on it and thought it would be a good place to start with my son (10 months) as we will be having a lot of travel over the next few months. I was horribly disappointed the first few seconds into it. The animations are terrible and come off really creepy, and my son wasn't even interested by it. The quality of the DVD is really poor with a lot of glitches. Too bad I can't return it! I will not be purchasing any more Gallping Minds DVD's again."
3,So So,This was an okay smoothie maker. My husband and I make fresh fruit smoothies every morning. This machine didn't last that long. Maybe 8 months or so. Now granted we used it every day. I decided to purchase a different brand that came with a warranty.
1,Wrong Part Of the Map!,"What a shame. I still have no idea what this DVD is like. For the second time I ordered it and received a DVD that only works in regions 3/4/6. Amazon clearly lists the region code as being Region 1 for this DVD and I clearly live in Pennsylvania not Zimbabwe. Why would an American company send an American consumer a product that only works in Mongolia not once BUT TWICE?????????? You got me. Anyway I am sending it back for a refund a second time. I honestly am starting to doubt this DVD even exists in Region 1 format. Amazon can prove me wrong by sending it to me in Region 1 format if they bother reading the reviews their customers post. Until then it gets 1 star. ""1"" as in the region code it is SUPPOSED TO BE in order to work in my Blu-Ray player! DUH!!!!!"
1,Watch Out,"This could have been an outstanding product if it wasn't for the decision to take footage from multiple concerts and put them along one audio track. If you didn't understand that (which is very possible) while watching, say, 'Around the world' you HEAR one show throughout, but the footage was edited so that you could see up to 3 different performances along that audio. Because of this you'll have syncing issues. If you are a musician you will notice it looks awkward then figure out ""Hey what i SEE them playing, isn't what I'm HEARING"". This in my opinion, spoils the continuity of the DVD. I recommend buying slane castle, even though they touched up anthony's voice on it."
2,Oh What A Shame..........,"When I saw this DVD was to be released, I could'nt wait. When it was eventually released, it took me a week to find somewhere with a copy. When I finally got it and started playing it, I was extremeley dissappointed. Went and replaced it, and well still dissappointed.This dvd has on around half of the songs a sync problem, ie actual sound is not in time of mouth movement.I have tried replacements, and on the 2nd copy have tried it 3 different dvd players.....still the same issue.It is such a shame I would have given this dvd 5 stars, now I doubt if I'll even keep it."
5,Very good book for general knowledge of Tibet and Tibetans,"This is a very well written book for those who have general interest on Tibet and Tibetans, given the fact there is barely any other books currently available written by highly qualified experts on Tibetan history and Tibetan people for general audience, this book does go a long way. The previous reviewer's comment is just utterly strange and unfair."
5,IT'S AS IF THEY WERE BACK TOGETHER,"I know, that's John French doing that amazing impersonation of Van Vliet, but you know what? It's amazing. And who better?The Captain himself declined - so, why fuss?The music never sounded clearer or stronger.And they hit a great number of favorites kicking the set off with a blistering Moonlight On Vermont.the only annoying part is having to listen to Matt Groenig do the intro every time I put it in.This is a tremendous live performance and I only wish they had lasted long enough for me to see them."
5,Cute Cute Cute,"I wanted to share my love of childrens stories with my significant other, and I got her this gift. It has a cute story, cute illustrations, and a wonderful message."
5,Loved it!,"I bought this book for my husband for Christmas (we have no kids -- but we do have a Pug!), and we both fell in love with it. Yaccarino has a great storytelling ability, and the illustrations were priceless. A good book for any pug-owner to have, and a great story for kids to read and learn about being who they are."
2,You can only find acceptance among those who are like you?,"As a strong supporter of anti-bias education, I really, really wanted to like this book. I now wish that I had read the two negative reviews because, unfortunately, I share their opinion. The message that I take from this book is that if you are different, you can only find acceptance among those who think and look just like you. So much for diversity! I'm reluctant to share this book with my kids but may give it a try anyway since it could provide them with an opportunity for critical thinking."
3,Becareful what you read,"Alfred is compelled to lie about himself to a the new dog across across the fence. Why? Because he is unlovable, everyone tells him so. The other dog doesn't care what Alfred is, they never see each other, as a friendship is developed as they talk and discover they have a lot in common. then they decide to meet and find they are exactly alike! This story could have been so much better if the other dog was a gorgeous something, or maybe not even a dog at all, and unusual squirrel. My point is that Alfred lies about himself and finds acceptance. . .in someone exactly like himself.I gave it three stars because I saw what the author was trying to do and the illustrations are very engaging. I am just not recommending the story."
2,Yawn.,"A girl's grandfather disappears, so she and some friends go out to the desert to look for him, where they are of course attacked by the Sandsquatch. The characters aren't sympathetic or interesting, and left me feeling pretty bored. This is very low budget, but I guess I can't criticize it for looking like a film school project, however it wasn't too far above those standards. The monster was rather cool looking, and moved in a way that gave it some menace. Overall it was good enough for a boring Tuesday evening or something, but I wouldn't expect much."
2,"Well, it IS a textbook","Not the easiest read in the world. There is a lot of omission of terms and without a professor explaining the gaps, there is a lot of head scrathing involved."
5,I bought this,I found this to bar holder to be something that keeps my basement clutter free. I would purchase another if I had too many Olympic bars around the room. This is a good product when you want thing out of the way.
4,luved it,"heyheyhey, this book is great for fantasy fans, it has all the elements that make up a good story, but i need to read it again befor i get the next one and the children's section of the library is closed! argh!"
4,The nine charms that charmed me,"This book is good but,I woud add a little more fighting ,otherwise it was super!I think it is a good book for anyone who likes magic,knights,kings and queens and harry potter.If you haven't read this book I sugest you read it soon!"
5,A Must Read book,"This is a very interesting book.It's full of fantasy and magic. If you like Harry Potter,you would enjoy this book.Niko, the ChooserAurora, the ProtectorWalker, the BearerThis book is about their adventures in another distant world.I really enjoyed it. I've read the second book.I would recommend this book to those who enjoy reading books of fantasy and magic. Please read it!!"
5,This friggin kills me,"Nothing is funnier than Sealab and that's a fact. And not only is Bizzaro a greeeat episode...it's the best next to stimutax! ""Bu Buda Bu Buda, I layed an egg for you!"" To bad that Captain Murphy is dead, that makes me cry. At least Alex Astrada is still kickin it."
3,Mooncheese is an idiot,Sorry bud if you thought BIZARRO is funny there probably isnt a whole lot you wont laugh at. Bet you think teletubbies are a riot too. Woah dude lay off the cronk. O by the way its erik estrada not alex estrada. your a moron.
5,Great book for a total beginner!,"I'm a musician of 20 years who has finally entered the world of virtual instruments (with some hesitation I must admit) and I must say that the Reason 3 for Windows & Macintosh book really helped me overcome those fears if you will. I'm not much for manuals because most, as most musicians know, speak about the product as if you've already used it and have prior knowledge about it. The Reason 3 book, however, puts everything on an easy to understand level and the pictures do help a lot but would be more helpful if some were in color.In a nutshell, I cracked open the book and fired up my Mac on a Saturday morning and 3-4 hours later I was able to go in, pull up what I wanted and make some nice tracks. I'm still working on the mastering and some other odds and ends but I'm confident that this book will definitely get me through with flying colors! BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!"
3,It does the job but I want more,"If you a looking for a fast guide so that you can produce simple music withou much thinking, try this one. I used it ans it gave me some insights, but I really missed more in-depth explanations of key concepts, and more explanations about the consequences of my tweaks. The tutorials as much more ""do this and then do that"", than ""do this, and this will happen, otherwise, this will happen because of this"", which I prefer.I am now using the Reason Power! books, and it seems much more complete and satisfying for my needs. I like to understand everything I am doing to achieve a certain result, so that I can use this knowledge in order to do different stuff from that same process. Reaso Power! gives me more of that than this VQSG."
4,Affirmatively Speaking,"Most long-time Yes fans thrive on going deep into the band's repertoire. Which is why long-time Yes fans are usually unimpressed with the available compliations. The avant garde nature of the tracks on this release should satisfy long-time Yes fans, for the most part. However better choices could have been made in a few instances. For example, the single edit of America is a farce. The full length version would have been preferable over Heart of the Sunrise or And You and I. Those songs appear in quantity on compliations elsewhere. Owner of a Lonely Heart and Love Will Find A Way are significant exceptions to the very progressive nature of the other tracks. Hold On or City of Love from 90125 and Shoot High Aim Low or Almost Like Love from Big Generator from the Eighties Yes would have been more suitable for this cool compliation. This rocking release doesn't measure up to five stars because of that. Overall though, it does earn four stars."
4,"Good selection, better off with Yesstory","Yes, they picked mainly songs that were popular and stood out on their respective albums. What they didn't do is pick enough of them. To try and fit the ""best of"" Yes onto one CD isn't going to happen, and therefore a LOT of classic tracks are left off this one. You're better off with Yesstory, a 2CD set, or the 4CD box set Yesyears. If you like all you hear there, just buy the whole Yes catalogue. You won't be dissappointed."
3,TOO PRICEY,"An attractive book to have in your collection, but, as a source book it would be wiser to purchase The Necronomicon by Simon. This has more detailed information on a wider area of this science including spells for most of your needs. The Necronomicon Workbook is better suited to the experienced user for easy to read and find information with its large typing for use while there is little light available. Overall, the only pro this book has to offer is a little extra information."
1,I can't believe it!,"Brother Moloch has written an excellent chapter on how to create line and circle sigils, unfortunately he uses this to redesign the 50 seals! If this would not anger a god, I don't know what will. Then, again, if the seals needed to be redone, are they really authentic or just something that Lovecraft dreamed up?"
4,Great album... Not a VNV Rip-off either,"Whoever said that this album was a VNV Nation Rip-off because the name Pride and Fall ALMOST sounds like Praise the Fallen is a complete idiot. Sorry, pal, but that's a poor excuse. Pride and Fall have a very different, darker sound. The music is strong, and although the album may have a few ""filler"" tracks, they're all good, and worth the money."
2,Behind the times,"Nothing really memerable here. Mediocre musicianship at best. The chord progressions are just basic piano no no's and even the programming is pretty bland. Sequences just start and stop out of thin air. The drums are the same heard on albums dateing back to the late 80's and the beats are right off any groove boxes presets. It wouldnt hurt if this band learned something about music theory or took even one or two lessons on any instrument.The lyrics are bland and uninspiring. Though theres some promise here, its just too little to late. This genre is on to the next level and Pride and Fall is nothing you havnt heard before. This is just way to mediocre. And a little liner note, having worked with a few companies I happen to know there was a huge amount of pressure to release a VNV Nation like group for financial reasons. Not to say this is a rip off in anyway, it doesnt even come close."
2,Uhh...,"Is it a coincidence that the name ""Pride and Fall"" sounds similar to the VNV Nation album title ""Praise the Fallen""? This is one of the worst rip-off bands I have heard thus far in the EBM scene. While most bands in this scene at least attempt to be subtle about their influences, this album is a near cover-version attempt at cashing in on the success of labelmates VNV Nation. And even there they fail... the production and mixing is extremely uneven, the vocals, although clearly trying to mimick Ronan Harris are even weaker that that marginal icon's, and the songs are completely forgettable... only ""Construct"" stands out, and by the time the ho-hum chorus kicks in, even that faulters. Further, when one notices that there are only 7 actual full length songs and that the rest are throwaway 'intro' type tracks, the album becomes even less desirable."
1,Pleasant Eye-Candy,"This book is basically pleasant eye-candy with nice pictures. However, the canning methods illustrated are outdated and potentially dangerous. For example, the book suggests creating a vacuum seal on jars by turning over the jars after filling. Since this method does not effectively seal out all potential contaminants, it is not perfectly safe! There are better reference books out there, most notably ""Blue Ribbon Preserves"" by Linda J. Amendt."
1,Eat the Sun,"I thought that I was getting a physical product when I clicked the Purchase Button, but instead got something that I had to download. I didn't have the necessary tools, so got Nothing for $10!!! Even when I asked for help from my son, he said that he, too, didn't have what was needed.There was no way, that I could find to ""return this item"", so am stuck with paying $10 for a lesson that all is not as it seems.I'm sure Eat the Sun is a fine film, but will not be able to attest for sure."
5,vintage heroes,"My 4 year old loves everything super hero, but it's hard to find stuff in that genre of toys/movies that's not totally inappropriate for his age, these cartoons are kid safe, fun to watch (my kids love them anyway) and sometimes funny just because of how outdated and wacky they are."
5,ectactic50,The person I bought this gift for was very happy. He stated it brought back good memories from his childhood. Stated the classics are the best. Best of all the delivery and the condition of the product was excellent.
4,This is great,Classic cartoon that still is entertaining to my seven year old and five year old . Wholesome language is a plus. However be warned that it moves much slower than modern cartoons.
2,Disappointed,REally thought this was a collection of comic books. It ended up being a cartoon DVD. I am keeping it because it was inexpensive.
1,The Charlie Tuna show.....,"Having seen this cartoon recently on Cartoon network, I Laugh at how bad it was. It was typical Saturday mourning stuff with both flat animation and terrible voice acting.I also saw Aquaman appeared on Smallville and the charater design looked really awful in live action form. It was a cartoon being adapted in the wrong visual medium. I really must say that the intelligence level of both DC Comics and it's fans must be very low, for liking this awful stuff , same goes for Warner Brothers."
4,Adventures of Aquaman,"I wrote to Warner and asked them to release the Superman Aquaman Hour in full. So they left the accompanying Superman stories out of both this and their Superman release from earlier this year.Add the fact that they left out the guest star segments originally in the show (Teen Titans, Justice League, Atom, Hawkman, Flash, Green Lantern), and I'm very disappointed. However, all36 Aquaman stories are here to enjoy, and they are among Filmation Studios' best work.Let's keep nagging Warner to plug the gaps"
2,Ouch,"I bought these because they were the highest rated and the best selling at the time. As cool as these are, the little flap that goes between your big toe and your middle toe on the size 10 pair I received hurt. I've worn them around on the beach and around several city blocks thinking the flap would loosen up ... alas, the flap isn't any softer and they still hurt. My wife tried them on as well and agreed."
4,"Comfortable, except the bottle opener","I haven't worn sandals in many, many years, because I would kick them off as I walked, and they didn't offer much padding. If I'd known about quality sandals like Reef's I definitely would've changed my mind. After three days of wearing these I love how snug the band is that holds the sandals to my feet. The strap between toes is very comfortable as well. My only complaint is the bottle opener. This probably isn't an issue for people of normal size, but my weight means I put more pressure on the sandals which pushes the bottle opener up into my foot. I'll still wear these for short periods of time, or around the house, but am going to order a different style of Reefs without the opener. If you're not tubby like I am you will love these sandals."
5,Great item,Shoes are in perfect condition and they were shipped very fast. Fantastic deal and total satisfaction.
4,Excellent Sandals,"They don't last forever (maybe a season) but they are the most comfortable sandals I have ever owned, currently on my third pair."
2,"PHEW They STINK, Literally","I have been wearing these for 4 months now doing all the things you hope to do in a sandal. The comfort is amazing, A+.Their demise is that they stink, literally and it is becoming unbearable. It maybe the leather strap after so many wet/dry cycles that is causing it or the rubber sole soaking in all the foot juice but I have never had a sandal stink like these do. After a lot of reading about how to remove it everyone has their own suggestion with no real cure out there. Some seem like a lot of maintenance for a sandal that is IMO supposed to be pretty much maintenance free.They look cool, they feel cool but unless you work on a farm you won't smell cool in these shoes."
2,"If your foot is even just a bit wide, avoid.","The sandal looks fantastic, but my foot did not even come close to fitting in these. It was like stuffing a sausage through a pinhole. I gave it two stars for the cool bottle opener feature."
3,Comfy and stylish but make my feet stink.,"I shower every morning and these shoes make my feet stink! Even the cheapest local slippers I can buy don't hold odor like these. I shower every morning and by noon, sitting at a desk, I feel like pig pen from the peanuts gang. A noticeable air wafts from these shoes. Doesn't happen with my earth shoes, crocks, or Teva's... Super bummed because these are quite comfy and stylish... So much so that I bought 2 pairs. Any suggestions on how best to treat them or clean them would be appreciated."
5,He want take them off.,"Got these for my son as he is in drum corp camp this summer. I wanted to get him something better then the throwaways as they drill for 12-16 hours a day. He put them on when he got home and wears them everywhere. Appear to be well made and the extra support in the heel looks good. Could care less about the can opener but, its there. Very happy with them they look good and he really likes them."
5,Great sandals!,"I purchased the Fanning sandal as a gift. The recipient assures me the sandals look great, are true to size, and are among the most comfortable and versatile he has worn."
5,Feel So Good,Feel Great. Don't cause a blister between your toes. Hug your foot; and its hard to accidentally throw one when youre running. Colors on the bottom andin the air cushion look great.
4,Reef Sandals,"I gave these a 4 star rating because the leather between your toes really chafes when your feet are wet. I am somewhat of a tenderfoot and I had severe abrasion cuts from these sandals between my toes because the ""joiner"" is leather and not fabric."
5,Love 'em,"Excellent flip flop, extremely satisfied. Wore them all summer, very comfortable. Priced na little higher than other brands but I feel well worth it."
3,"Great support, but chafing between the toes","I was looking for a pair of sandals with great support, and these are right-on. But I guess I'm not used to the chafing between the toes. I quickly decided to ""mod"" them with some strips of adhesive ""mole skin"" padding. But, now they look kind of funky. Still some chafing."
2,Tight fit and the fabric that goes between your toes is not comfortable,"For what these cost I would expect them to be great but the fabric that goes between your toes causes pain and they are also a bit too tight a fit for my regular size that I wear. So, I will be returning these and getting sandals that cause no discomfort between my toes."
4,"fits well, awesome look",This is my second pair of REEF sandals... my first pair lasted nearly 8 years so I had to get another...love the arch in the middle and the way these contour to your feet. You can dress up with these or go causal...
5,Comfortable and long lasting,"I've had these thongs for 16 months, worn them most days and I still love them. The foot bed has worn where my heel contacts the sole (understandably) but only in as much as the textured part is now smooth. However this is the only visible sign of wear. My only concern is that they don't appear to be made in half sizes, however I got a size 11 (would like a 10.5) and these still fit fine. Overall these are very comfortable and I have purchased a spare pair for when these finally wear out."
5,Funniest book I have ever read,"I read this book the first time while waiting on Surgeryand forgot to take my pain medication. Dan Parkinson is the master of the running gag and comedic timing with perfectly balanced use of coincidence to bring together seemingly unrelated events in an incredible plot. A Russian terrorist, an Elephant, a Homing Cow and a cowboy romance with one common root (turnips!) The rest of Parkinson's books are as well written. After this try Calamity Trail."
5,When does the movie come out?,Wow! Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down down even compare. This was action packed...wasted no time with details we ALREADY knew about 911...instead told us the details we WISH we knew about 911! Capn' Slade is a man's kind of man! I'm serioius when does the movie come out?
5,Classic Jam from Da King of Music,"this is the song with some banging Re-Mixes. Feelin On YO BOO-TAY!!! is the Jam. if he used the lyrics that he drops on the T-Pain""In Love with a stripper"" Re-Mix for this now it would blow up even bigger. this was a Cleaver play on words&the Music was on point. He could do some serious Opera to this Jam on the real."
4,Some setup required,The bass came on schedule but it needed to be set up - lowered each string and moved bridge segments back to get intonation right.
5,ncis,It was pretty much a great surprise for my wife. And havent gotten any complaints from her bout it. It was great
2,Buyer beware,"I bought this product from another seller thru Amazon.com. I love the NCIS series, but I was not too happy with the product that I received. The 1st season's disk #6 was defected and it seems I can't get a replacement copy for it. Which is a bummer since the extras are on that disk. It's interesting to see that it has Chinese subtitles with it. I'm not too sure if it was made in China for fans out there. Which got me to think that my DVD machine is having some trouble reading some of the disks."
5,love this group,I have only watched the first two seasons and have enjoyed it very much. Now I am looking forward to the remainder of my order.
2,NCIS,"We were somewhat disappointed by the quality of the dvd's. We were very disappointed that several of the dvd's special features were not on the dvd (even though they were listed). We had one disk that wouldn't play at all. Otherwise, WE LOVE NCIS!"
5,Love it.,"Pure Awesomeness. The packaging is very convenient, the seasons are divided up into 6 boxes, and inside the 6 boxes are 3 sets of dvd cases each. The DVD cases are thin, so they're easy to bring along with you somewhere."
5,Amazing!!!!!,"It's not every now and then that you come across a police procedural drama that increases in popularity as the seasons go by. In its 8th season and NCIS is at its peak. The one man to certainly look for is Leroy Jethro Gibbs aka Mark Harmon.Great performance by all in the cast, though ""ducky"" and ""Tony"" top the league.There was no way iwad going to miss a chance to get these DVDs ; looking forward to the next season."
3,Bad Qua;ity Control-NCIS Seasons 1-6,"In the Season One Set, Disc 6 would not play. In Season Two, Sisc Two would only play Episode one and nothing else. I have now finished the rest of the Seasons due to time constrictions. I am very disappointed in theoverall quality of the Set."
2,Bootlegged item,"I thought I was ordering a new NCIS 1-6 DVD set. What I received, was a bootlegged set. The vendor refunded me $50.00 immediatley, when I complained that I had not received it before Christmas, the item shipped Dec. 6, but I did not get it until Dec. 29, from China. The vendor said the company was from the US, his store may be here, but item was shipped from overseas. Have emailed him that I am not happy, but no response. DVD's work OK, but again deceived as to what I was really ordering. Would not recommend this vendor."
3,Saler Ignores Email,"I have EMAILED Saller about this product, some of the discs are corroded and in more than a week since I still have not recieved a responce. Don't think I'll be doing business wiith them again."
1,Non delivery of purchase!!!!!!!,"i can't review this item, i haven't gotten it and i can't get in touch with the seller to find out why. i have written several requests, and the note i receive back is that that left Amazon. I spent a lot of money for this gift. I have gotten no response from the seller and not much help from Amazon!"
1,NCIS Show rocks but this disc set doesnt,If you are thinking of buying htis disc set then turn around get one from a store it might be more expensive but the ones you buy from a store are not cheap nock offs This disc set sucks. I played them and 60& of them play but the others skip or scratch some discs didnt even play. I made the mistake and I dont want anyone else to I would rather buy one someone burned onto a dvd rom than this it would be cheaper but worth more than this crap.NCIS is one of my favorite shows
5,NCIS,"My Son-in-law had me order this for his Christmas gift to give my daughter... She LOVES NCIS!! I would have to say she is the ultamite NCIS fan.. She loves these DVD's, now she can watch her favorite show 24/7 if she wants.. I would recommend this to anyone who really likes this show."
5,NCIS: Seasons 1-6,"This show is very good. It is serious, yet amusing and very funny with Michael Weatherley. I love his character. Arrived in great condition and very quickly."
2,NCIS Season 1-6,"I believe these discs are copies, not originals. I was on the last disc of the first season when I had a problem with it skipping. This skipping happenned sporadically thru season 2 and again in season 3. I only openned the first 3 seasons. The other three are still in the original packaging. I researched the UPC and found several do not match true items. I would like to return all 6 seasons for a full refund because these are not new items. I would like directions on what must be done to correct this situation. Any help you can give me in this matter will be greatly appreciated. These DVDs were sent to me from a company called Quality DVD shipped on November 25, 2009. I have never had a problem with any items purchased thru Amazon.com and will continue to be a customer."
1,Talk about a rip-off,I have never been so totally ripped off before. The DVD's were supposed to be new. They were junk. Most of them wouldn't play at all. Some crackjed as they were being removed from the case. The case looked new but was an obvious Knock-off. The real NCIS DVD's come in a totally different case. I was really taken.
5,Great Series,"Great Series, great price. This is the only way to see a TV series. There is so much tie in between the episodes that you miss when you watch them a week apart!NCIS: Seasons 1-6"
1,scratched and falling apart,"pretty much all of the discs are scratched in some way, some episodes aren't even able to be watched which is very frustrating, the boxes are falling apart themselves have had to glue some back together. not a satisfying purchase what so ever."
3,Stainless steel and aluminum construction Pan,"After reading all the great reviews of this pan, I ordered it with high hopes. On its first use, the pans inside cooking area turned a chalky white and would not clean off easily. Everytime I use the pan this happens, no matter what I am cooking in it. Even water boiling leaves a stain & pitting! The only thing I have found to clean the stains off is CLR. Also,I know its not a non stick fry pan buy every thing sticks to it, even after using cooking spray!"
4,I wish it were the color it appears in the photo,"Fiesta ware is as always, nice ceramic ware. However I ordered this because it seemed to be a light, buttery yellow. The bowls that came are the color of French's mustard. Just be forewarned. If you want soft yellow, I think you'd want the one called Ivory."
5,Great for cereal or serving side dishes,"A very nice size that I use daily. I love the brilliant colors of the Fiesta bowls. They make the table look so cheerful! I ordered 4 different colors in this bowl. When they arrived,one had broken, Amazon replaced it immediately when I called, and it arrived within a day or two in perfect shape. These bowls are stoneware, so great everday bowls."
5,Love Fiesta!,"The Fiesta 24-ounce bowl is good looking and very versatile. Use it for cereal, soup, generous helpings of ice cream, and as a small serving bowl. The Sunflower color is cheerful and more subdued than other yellows."
4,Nice Bowl - wrong size!,"This is a very nice deep bowl but the wrong size for a serving bowl. (which is what I wanted) The nice thing about this bowl is that it is deep - so if you use it for something with a lot of juice - it will not splatter out very easy. The 3 cup size will work for somethings very well - but limited for anything large....All in all though, it is still a very nice bowl and I am sure I will find more uses for it in the future."
5,Love the mixed colors,I went from plain white dishes to thes vibrant colors and am so pleased with my choices. Everything arrived safely and I saw no flaws at all. I am now looking for unique pieces to go with my colors. Fiestaware makes it fun!
5,Love these bowls!,"I am so happy with my fiesta ware in general but these bowls are my favorite pieces. I love how deep they are. I had shallow bowls before with my old dish set and my kids were always sloshing cereal and soup over the edge. We don't have this problem anymore. I love the colors too, especially shamrock. I ended up getting scarlet, shamrock, sunflower, and cobalt."
3,"Do not stack well, hard to store in cabinet","Let me start by saying I absolutely love Fiestaware, but there bowls are not my favoite. They do not fit inside each other so you can not stack them. If you are ordering a few and are limited on space, these do not work."
5,Fiesta 24 Ounce Gusto Bowl,"Exactly as described. Matches the other Fiesta Turquoise items I have. Great size! Much larger than the standard bowl that comes with the place settings. Large enough for chili, large cans of soup, etc. Great for ice cream too!"
3,don't buy unless you have tons of space,"These are very heavy bowls that do not stack well. I love fiesta, but I began buying them for the practicality of them. They failed in this design. ;("
5,Made is the USA,price was a bit high but worth every penny! Was happy also that their made in the USA. these Fiesta items are hands down the best we have owned in fifteen years of marriage. loved them so much we plan on buying them all. Amazon does a great job shipping them also!
3,Not good quality.,"There was no stamp on the bottom of this showing it was genuine fiestaware. The tell tale tool marks of fiesta gusto bowls (near the top edge) were not there. Great price, arrived quickly, but not comparable to other fiesta gusto bowls I have purchased from the same seller."
2,Elementary My Dear Watson.,"This vidio is for the rank novice who has not been on a sporting clays field. It would serve as a good introduction to someone who is going to shoot sporting clays for the first time (a wife or girlfriend that you wish to accompany you). If you have shot more than a few times and are looking for an instructional video to improve your performance, this is not the one."
5,Two classic scores!,"This cd includes Frank DeVol's score for the Robert Aldrich classic, ""Flight of the Phoenix""; an exciting score for an equally exciting movie. Goldsmith's justifiably famous score for Patton features the original recordings, including the haunting ""echoplexed"" trumpets. Also, the previous reviewer's one-star rating is rather inexplicable considering this is FILM SCORE release. Why would soundbites from the film be included? Bizarre. All-in-all a great package and a limited edition (only 3,000 copies). Get yours while you can - you won't be disappointed!"
4,It is what it is.,"If this is what is available to you, by all means get it. The film score is as intense as it gets. However, if you're a music lover and not a collector, the score is available in the older 2 disc version of the DVD. You have to do a little hunting, but it is used as the background for one of the special features. They even have about a dozen different samples of the echoing trumpets.As for the speeches, alas, I shall have to console myself with the four vinyl copies I've managed to acquire:-)"
1,Seeing Double,"I ordered this book and discovered that it has exactly the same content as Paulsen's ""Zero to 60: A Motorcycle Journey of a Lifetime."" The only thing different is the title. This is deceptive and you don't wan't to order this one if you've read the other -- and visa versa."
3,Author takes to the Open Road,A great book in the genre of the open road as the author takes his Harley from New Mexico to Alaska
2,Sad sad sad,"This book starts out almost nicely subdividing shapeshifting methods in categories, but falls apart when the writer goes on babbling about animals... She thinks Black dogs are ""eviler"" than other dogs, she thinks animals with natural red eyes are not good familiars beacause of the eye color, she puts herbivorous animals in a second class wagon to no where... She thinks a load of stuff on animals that is not absolutly true. I am not arguing on the shapeshfting part that is not totally bad (could be worse), but on some things this writer puts in the book that make you wonder if she actually does know animals as she claims she does and if she does know shapeshifters as she says...If you are not new to this argument and feel like separating the loads of dumb stuff from the usefull stuff it could be good, if you are new to this kind of topic,DONT BUY IT, buy something else or the author could put you on the wrong path and make you think things that are absolutly not true."
1,AWFUL!!!,"This book was so awful. Thank god I bought it used and cheap. The author talks as some elitest preaching down to her worshipers. Some claims she makes are so ridiculous, avoid black cats cause ""they attract unsavory spirits and bad energy"". Im soooo thankful I read this AFTER I read Lupa's book because this book is so discouraging I wouldnt have pursued animal magic at all after reading it. The author seems most concerned with the EXACT definitions to the types of shapeshifters, she spent way too long describing the details of what makes one an integrated, as opposed to non-integrated as opposed to hereditary as opposed to classical, physical bla bla bla . The voice of this book is so immature and insecure, like shes trying to make sure YOU know that she herself is a genuine shapeshifer. It comes across as very unfriendly , the author is one of the popular cool people and YOU ARENT!!!Id say read Lupa's books they are so much more helpful and supportive and full of useable information.Julia"
1,"Great Fantasy, Poor Fact","This book is horrible. It inaccurately portrays the frequency of phenotypes, the purpose of phenotypes, and the actual nature of shifting... She doesn't cite any facts, just the few legends she has not made up. She also portrays weres as confused homosexual teenage cultists. She exaggerates the commonness of Physical shifting..."
3,Interesting but lacking in some areas.,"I bought this book because ever since I can remember I have been fascinated by stories of ""were-creatures"". So, upon seeing this book in the store I bought it. I thought that the historical information was wonderful, and I thought that her descriptions of the different types of shifting were fascinating. however, when it came time to explain how to actually achieve this shift her attitude changed to a ""if you are not a hereditary shifter you're screwed"" tone. This book offered no useful information in this department, even though she stated repeatdly that shifting is possible even for someone who is not a shifter. Overall, I would say that the book is a good but, but it is, in my opinion, lacking in some areas."
1,Not a review,I was just wondering if this is a genuine release or a bootleg. I don't remember this being released anywhere.
2,Terrible - a rare mis-hit,"Aside from 'Vertigo', this CD is pretty bad. The songs have no good hooks, and the themes are not much better."
1,No worthy at all,"This album makes me feel sick. It's quite easy to reply to all fans who don't like this new album (including me) writing things like ""they don't know about music, they don't like U2, they hate U2"" but all that is false. Every fan here loves U2, but many ones think U2 is going down and down. Expressing disagreement with this below average album doesn't mean that one hates the band, is just disagreement with this commercial, poor and recycled music way. This album is nothing but biggest U2 mistake ever."
4,Their hearts are back!,"Yeah, the music isn't that groundbreaking, but there are some great melodies and lyrics and the vibe is up again. I loved the 90s cyncism and glam, and now I'm happy to hear it break and some heart come spilling out. Their is love showing in this album and that takes some guts. In addition, I bet this is going to be a pretty sweet live show.Get it and listen. :)"
1,Can't stand this album!,"As if Zoorapa, Pop, and all That You Can't Leave Behind weren't bad enough, U2 continues their sucking spree with this, How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb. I can't believe this; and people say Metallica sold out, U2 became, literally, marketing tools! Anyone who calls this their best album is either:A, a new fan.B, someone who hasn't heard their best albums: War, Joshua Tree, and Achtung BabyorC, an idiot.U2 is dead. Face it, they can never make a record as good as War, or Joshua tree, or Achtung Baby. I mean, for god's sake, they appear of the ""Now that's what i call music"" crapilation. I hope these guys realize how horrible they became, and then break up. Sad, so sad..."
1,THE BEST U2 ALBUM BUY IT NOW !!!!!,"Please my friends, stop marketing for U2, really. Is shameful.With advices like ""U2 MASTERPIECE"", ""IS U2 BEST"", ""MUST HAVE, I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEW TOUR!!!"" and many other ones it demonstrate the shameful marketing campaign of the people who work for U2. If the album had been excellent would not be necessary to put to tens of people to express words of infinite adoration to this work here, since real fans had been the ones who would have said that. But given that is not the reality, U2 is forced to campaign this shameful way. Horrible."
1,Happiness is a warm gun,"The new album finally has been revealed. For misfortune of all us, the 4 years waiting have been in vain.This new album shows a numb, mainstream, unispired and bored U2, ideal for dumb teens who want more and more CD's of any band. Here doesn't exist musical quality. All opposite, this album is an exaltation of Bono's Rock Star , who almost can't sing, and still thinks he is 25 years old and he can do whatever he wants with his rough voice. The lack of musical risk is seen in all scope, bands clothes , Bono`s hair and sunglasses , the recycled canned music from ATYCLB, the silly and unnecessary production, the excessive marketing campaign, etc. Despite all hype, the only thing U2 have obtained is the opposite effect, that is, more and more fans whom are waking up and stopping to adore unconditionally this sell out band wrongly called ""U2"".Happiness is a warm gun U2..."
1,commercial music designed for the masses,"And it works !!! you can see many fans loving this soup...but...more and more fans are waking up ( at last !! ). Bono promised heaven with this album, and we found hell.now is better to learn how to sing again Bono, really.I'm really upset by this fake album, really.The same songs, the same guitars, the same rough voice, the same production, all is the same !!! where's something new here ?The only worthy song is City Of Blinding Lights, the rest...just forget it."
2,Too religious,"All I have to say is U2 is a fabulous band, and with this new cd Bono has deeply saddened me by singing overtly about Christianity. I understand that his religious and humanitarian related beliefs were always on some sublevel in his music, but thats where they should stay. This new balantness takes down the art to just barely mediocre. If I wanted religious music I would buy it from that horrible ""Christian rock"" section in the music store. I just hope this overtness does not prove to be permanent trend in Bono's otherwise beautiful lyrics."
3,Great for beginners,"This is the first album I started taking them seriously. Vertigo, as commercial as it is, did the trick. U2 for this normally heavy rock fan never had enough mmphh. This album threw it in and then some. Every song isn't perfect. There's the usual reflective Bono for the geriatric. lol (jk) However, more than the first half makes it worth it. :)"
2,"Well, this is a bomb","Dear Friends...U2 has been at the center of my favourite music for over 20 years. I can not bash a band that has been there for me for so long. BUT... This record just sounds so safe, so flat, so thin.....OK, I'm going to say it......boring! The band and I are all older than we used to be. I too am boring I just wish they could have somehow avoided it! Everybody makes mistakes & right now I feel this is the biggest mistake record of their career. See you all in a few years and lets all hope for better next time.best"
1,As complicated as Maroon 5 or Britney Spears,"We hate this half-worked album because it's so ordinary, cheesy, artificial, commercial, lazy, cheap, easy, mainstream, filler, predictable, canned, recycled, dull and totally devoid of groundbreaking ideas.We love complicated U2 albums as Achtung Baby, Zooropa and Pop.When someone asked why Bono's singing of the line 'Tonight thank God's its them instead of you' in the new version of Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas was so lame and weak compared to his original (1984) singing, he said ""I thought that considering all the people dying everywhere in the world, it wasn't time for a roar, but for a whimper, a whimper for the dying"" !He is just as conformist as some fans who run to the nearest music store to buy any new U2 stuff as soon as possible. Stupidity"
1,A Souvenir,They can't leave behind the full weight of their support.This souvenir shows their recent musical ignorance and irrelevance.I cannot even remember 3 songs from such blatant corn.U2's music splits up.
3,"Oldies [kinda] that are ""in"" with kids","Don't let the title that I gave my review discourage you from buying this CD. I only gave this CD three stars for a couple of reasons. First, since U2 is from Ireland, sometimes their lyrics are not understandable. Also, sometimes in the really rock songs, the guitars and stuff are sooooo loud in the background that you can hardly hear the singer. In addition, I don't get the title of the album. When I first saw the album in Borders because a friend recommended it, I thought, since most albums do this, one of the songs or the featured song on the album is called ""How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb."" But when I flipped the CD over to look at the list of songs on the back, I found to my suprise, no song with that name. Some songs have pretty strange names like ""Yahweh."" Overall, I think this album is good and recommend it to people who love good, hard core, rock and roll."
2,"another year, another contractual obligation","It should have been called ""All That You've Heard Before"". One pumped three minute single to start the CD and a bunch of wallpaper to fill it out. While the completist U2 fan will want to add this to their collection, there are too many other great CDs out there for the rest of us to have bought this particular one. Although I haven't heard every last U2 album, this is easily the least of the seven or eight that I've heard. It's assembled all the trademarked sounds and peculiarities that fans have grown to expect but when an album provides all the satisfaction of tap water, sometimes being U2 is not enough."
1,This decade is the worst for music ever!!!,"And could U2 save the day, no, they put out an awful album lack of any passion or selective taste.The biggest dissapointment in the history of U2, they might not have one after this.I can't see how anyone would go to a concert to see these songs played live."
1,An awful bait and switch,The two singles are uncharacteristic of post-War U2 in that they rock most heavily. The rest of the album is typical post-Unforgettable Fire pablum. Awful. Look for mine for sale online at half-dot-com soon!
1,Reviewing just COLLECTOR'S EDITION,"I won't write about the album itself. Rather I'm gonna talk about Collector's edition.Don't expect an actual collector's edition ( if you're a Genesis or Pink Floyd fan then you really know what is a collector's edition ) cause it isn't. The ""book"" is just filled silly drawings. Not even lyrics nor photos nor history... NOTHING !!!. 48 pages of emptyness.The same thing happen with the filler bonus DVD. More and more commercials from a band who is lost and gone away by selling out to the i Tunes. Who need the same songs played twice ? why not more different tunes instead ?Shame on U2."
4,Very good,"Altough this isnt as good as the critics say it is, its still a very nice album with many good songs, and even some classics!The classics: City of blinding lights, Miracle drug, Sometimes you cant make it on your own.Good songs: Vertigo, All because of you, Man and a woman, One step closer.The rest of the album is sadly not that good, but still its a fantastic record from the worlds biggest band."
2,So-So,"A few good nuggets here,""Vertigo"", ""Yahweh"", ""City Of BlindingLights"", but not much else. U2 has lost most of the ""edge"" they used to have circa '79-'87. Gone is the distinctive cry of the Edge's searing and original guitar work. Also gone is the energy and stomp that used to propel so many of their great songs and albums of that period. Save for a few tunes, this cd limps along and doesn't offer much after four long years of waiting. ""All That You Can't Leave Behind"" was better but also fell short. I'm grateful for the magnificent treasure they have given us, from ""Boy"" to ""The Joshua Tree"", but maybe it's time to start releasing EP's instead of LP's."
3,Just a view from a Fly on the wall,"You know, its funny that there are 17 reviews of this album and IT HAS NOT EVEN BEEN RELEACED YET. So many people either saying ""this is U2's masterpiece!"" or ""This album sucks, U2 is dead"" that its starting to make me sick. Is U2 so huge that people have to comment on them even before they can leagaly listen to their work? Everywone seems to be obsessed with U2, either obsessed with loving them or obsessed with hating them. Give the Ireland boy's a break."
1,I can't believe these talentless hacks upset Mariah at the Grammys,"Personaly, I was livid that U2 won five Grammys this year. Mariah Carey was poised to win ALL 8 awards but she walked away with only three. How can U2 win 5 Grammys for an album that wasn't even released in 2005? I'm sorry, but this is robbery. U2 have cheated their way to the top with an album of mediocre songs like ""Vertigo,"" ""Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own,"" and the silly ""A Man and a Woman."" A stupid album for gullible people. U2 did NOT deserve to win anything at the Grammys!"
1,Dismal,"Dismal. Dismal. Dismal.The lyrics and vocals are insipid, with the exceptions of Vertigo and All Because of You."
2,Background Music,"Frankly, I found this CD to play like a collection of B-Side tunes: Enjoyable background music consisting of mildly interesting pop-rock sound. However, nothing stands out to define this as an album, and there was a total absence of the melodic singles (including the overrated ""Vertigo"") for which U2 is so well known.Thankfully, Edge does shine through with some very skilled guitar, saving the CD from outright disaster.Highly anticipated, but disappointing effort from my favorite band."
2,Vertigo is a misleading single for this record.,"While this record isn't terrible, it is pretty bad for U2 standards. All songs here are mid to slow tempo and quite dull; none of the other 10 tracks have the energy that Vertigo has. Slow songs are not a bad thing, just listen to 'All That You Can't...', but the ones here are just plain boring. I miss the adventurous U2 of the early to mid '90s. In my opinion, this record has been grosely overhyped and thus it's kind of disappointing you finally get to listen to it. 'All because of you' sounds like a bad rip off of Bowie's 'Hang On To Yourself', 'A Man and A Woman' will put you to sleep faster than a Tool record. Guess all those 4 star reviews from Rolling Stone and the like really are nothing more than maintainace for a business relation.The stuff on the DVD is mostly worthless, a funny performance of Vertigo by Edge and Bono only, a couple other versions that aren't worth the price of this 'deluxe edition'."
4,They still have it..,"If you are looking for experimental U2 such as `Zooropa' and `Pop',then this album is not for you.But if you are looking for clear, concise,good qualty songwritng in which there is a dearth of nowadays,then this album is for you.It`s not my favorite U2 album(I`m more keen on their early period,particularly `War'),but I still enjoy it enough to listen to it repeatedly.Highlights for me are `Vertigo',probaly one of the more hard rocking U2 songs in a while. `Sometimes you cant make it on your own',City of Blinding Lights, and `Man and a Woman' still prove U2 can make stirring,heartfelt, emotional music. How many bands can you say of that nowadays ?"
3,Better than the last effort,"At it's best, this album is wonderful-Love and Peace or Else is a great bluesy soundscape that must stand as U2's best political song in over a decade. City of Blinding Lights is next and is equally good, proving to be another of U2's best. Unfortunately, these two greats (there are others, but it is these two that feel to be the most sonically diverse) cannot make up for the occasional lapses that bring the album down (the atrocity that is Yahweh), and although it certainly is good to see U2 truly sounding impassioned about something, there just is not passion enough to make this album anything more than above average-I would recommend it, because there are some inspired songs, but it's certainly not consistent enough to be regarded as a classic."
5,Brilliant Album,"The songs are sometimes moving, sometimes heart-wrenching, sometimes magical, but always good. The music is like it's from another planet, the lyrics are poetic and uplifting. Excellent album, as a whole. A great gift. Life-changing.BUY IT!"
1,We Are the Old U2,"Hard to accept it, but U2 are so irrelevant now. They're a rotten band dying awfuly bad by their own marketing propaganda.Many desperate fans have said ""back to Old U2 !!!"", ""back to their roots !!!"", ""classic U2 !!!"", and things like that.But the truth is as follows:U2 was a rebel band fighting against the system.They had a white flag, three chords and the truth.The system had money, fast cars, power, greed and lies.U2 2000 have money, fast cars, power, greed and lies.We have a whitle flag and the truth.IN OTHER WORDS: U2 have become the same system they hated so much, and WE ARE the rebel U2.BACK TO WHICH ROOTS MY FRIENDS ? BACK TO WHAT ?"
1,How To Dismantle a Career,"Start by making a CD like this, and then ........................................................................................................"
3,u2 is not up to speed,"the new album reflect more of the pop-zooropia sound of the late 90it is not an album i would listen to more than once accept for vertigo an excellent u2 song. the last u2 album was a 5 this is a 3 at best, music sounds like background elevator music, with bits of edge guitar thrown in, too many lyric not enough catchy musicbuy all that you cant leave behind instead, u2 best of the last 10 years or so"
2,Rock is Dead,"If U2 is the best that rock has to offer these days, rock must be dead. The band that gave us ""Joshua Tree"" and ""Achtung Baby,"" are surely dead. This album pushes no new boundries and wallows in mediocrity. A band that usually pushes the envelope of musical technique, continually re-inventing itself, into something of interest for its fans, has finally hit rock bottom. Bono and lads, please retire before you start looking like the fat Elvis."
3,Not so good,I'm kind of upset...after all that HYPE? THIS is what they came up with? Every track seems boring and cliche. Totally straight-forward and formulaic. I wish I waited to read these reviews before wasting my money. I'm just glad I got it on sale.
2,Collector's Edition a Mixed Bag,"I let my emotions get the better of me and picked this up at a local Target store. You should know that the CD contained within DOES include the 12th track ""Fast Cars"" not available on the regular US album. That's the good part. The bad part: NO LYRICS to the songs, and the book is really not that interesting at all. Some scribbled notes by the band members, no interesting photographs to speak off, very disappointing. I will let other reviewers get into specifics about the songs, which I think are a notch below ""All That You Can't Leave Behind"" after 2 listens. Stick with the original album for less than ten bucks at Target."
2,Tired Hype,"U2 was, at one time, a force to be reckoned with. They had a sound and a message as well as the ideal that music could change things. On their last two outings, they have borrowed heavily from others as well as themselves. That's ok if you can do something new with it but these guys simply don't anymore. This is more a fulfillment to a contractual obligation than it is music. It's well crafted but ultimately empty and boring. Bono should stop trying to sing and go fulltime into his charitable pursuits."
2,disappointed,"The songs were great on the CD. The packaging leaves a lot to be desired, especially the CD being exposed in the sleeve. The booklet is a one time read and not very interesting. The prints were hard to read and a lot of the contents are gibberish. Overall I am disappointed in the product."
3,IT's GOOD...,"...but not as good as ""All That You Leave Behind"". This sound harks back to ""The Joshua Tree"" in spots. Nothing on this cd grabbed me like ""Elevation"" and ""Walk On"" did from the previous cd. ""Crumbs From Your Table"" is the closest. ""Vertigo"" is the hardest rocking song here. ""Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own"" is another great song. You can't go wrong with U2 though, and even a so-so U2 album is light years better than most of the crap thats out there today. Nice to see a rock album at the top of the charts again."
1,U2 are finished as musicians,"It's about time that people have wised up and see U2 for the joke that they have become. Despite This moronic CD was number 1 in the USA, surely most copies end up in the used bin after people hear how crappy it is. U2 are finished as musicians, no matter hype and all that bulls**t propaganda. They can't write decent songs anymore, period. As a fan pointed out, this garbage is just COPY-PASTE from ATYCLB. Plus Bono can't sing anymore. Shame on U2HTDAAB is the very proof that U2 are so popular that talent is no longer a factor. Straight garbage. I can't believe some people pretend to like this drivel, because 'it's U2 !!'. By the way there is a kid who keeps on writtin five star reviews hereat amazon for the sake of boostin the average I really pity that kid."
4,Retro U2,"Ever since I saw U2 open for J. Geils back in 1979 --a prelude to many great albums following ""Boy"" --I have liked them (I was there to see U2, but did stay for J. Geils!). Their songs have substance and emotion. Yeah, they are commercial--but with each album they have somehow reinvented themselves.. sometimes I have liked the change, other times I was not really all that interested.How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb harkens back to the U2 Unforgettable Fire and Joshua Tree albums... my favorites from U2. And, why not? With the likes of Steve Lillywhite, Daniel Lanois, and Brian Eno in on the production (along with Flood) you could not expect any less. This is the first U2 album I have been enamoured of since Joshua Tree. It is not that I do not own the others, it is just that they did not remain in my CD player long enough. On first listen I expect this album to hang out in my player for months."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!,I am giving it 5 stars. Classic 80's U2. Bono has never sounded better. The songs are all fantastic(I even like Vertigo) I have listened to it nonstop since I got it Tuesday.
1,Unforgivable crap,"This pathetic musical effort is unforgivable. The main reason why I hate it is... Mr Paul Hewson, better known as ""Bono"".The truth is that Bono does not deserve to sing for this former great band anymore. He just plain sounds horrible. He simply cannot sing. Listen to ""Unforgettable Fire"" and then this... His voice is annoying at the least !!!.U2 should quit as soon as possible."
5,The Real U2,"Soulful, joyous, jammin and WOW! These are thoughts that come to mind when I spin this CD. For those that do not like this, you do not get U2. Their music is today and always has been about feeling and human emotion. This is why they are a universally loved band. They get it and can share it better than almost anyone else. Sad for those that don't get it as at the root they are not about perfection or progression or style. U2 is all about the human condition of love, anger, passion, desire, pain, yearning and all of the feelings we as humans go through every day. This is why they continue to thrill: Very few other bands can pull this type of depth off. U2 is and will always be one of the most awesome musical experiences you can have. This is great stuff, don't miss it!"
5,just a note,"This is a great album. Yea, it is. I think the problem is that we are a little bit pampered by all the great stuff they have done before (Joshua Tree, War, Achtung Baby, Zooropa etc.). If HTDAAB was some release of some group we would give it 4 or 5 stars. It is not so common to record such album where all the songs are relevant."
3,How to create a decent album,"First of all, before you buy the album, if you're expecting ten more Vertigo's, or anything similar to an Elevation, don't waste your time. U2 does not ROCK on this CD, with the exception of the opening song, which does NOT reflect what is on the following tracks. I have a feeling that this album will grow on me, as most U2 albums have, but if you're expecting the edgy U2 you heard on Achtung Baby, or the great substance of their incredible 80's songs like Pride, New Years Day, Bad, the entire Joshua Tree album, etc., this album will be different than you thought.However, for those of you U2 fans that loved All That You Can't Leave Behind, think of this as a double album. After listening to it a few times, it seems like U2 didn't skip a beat and picked up right where they left off with their previous album. That is the best analogy I can give."
5,Another Classic U2 Album,Their best studio album behind Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. That should say it all.
1,awful music by awful band,"How can you people seriously say this was a good piece of music?u2 are talentless hacks and this is just another showcase for their inane attempts at music. Please, someone take away this band's right to exist along people with integrity. Every song is bad on this album, just like every song on every one of their others is bad. Bad, Bad, Bad."
4,U2 returns with thoughtful modern rock tunes,"Irish rock vets U2 have released another fine album. This album has influences from multiple stages of U2's career, and highlights include tracks like Miracle Drug, Yahweh, Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own, City of Blinding Lights, and Original of the Species. Bono's voice is a bit worn but his lyrics remain in top form along with Edge's guitar work. Modern rock music often lacks the tuneful artistry found in U2's albums, so this album is likely to be well-received, even though it doesn't have anything that quite matches captivating U2 anthems from the Joshua Tree through Achtung Baby era. This isn't U2's best but it is a solid album that should satisfy many fans and demonstrate why U2 has remained so successful for so many years - they continue to release memorable material and have been able to stay together and productive while other acts have lost their luster."
3,Leaving out the vowels,"I just can't get into this one. I really want to like it, but beyond its commercial releases, I just am not feeling it."
4,U2 still rule!,"U2 proves their staying power with this album. From the deliriously catchy ""Vertigo"" to the glam ""Love and Peace or Else"" to the wonderful ""Crumbs From Your Table"", they live up to the hype and then some. Bono's voice sounds as wonderful as it ever did and The Edge seems to have rediscovered his guitar. My only two quibbles are: (1) I wish more of the songs were like ""Vertigo"" and (2) I didn't really care for the song ""Yahweh"". But that's just me. Anyways, get a copy and enjoy!"
1,Decade of decadence,"I do not support to see a passive U2, inactive, sold, commercial, cynical, lazy, fop, unimaginative, turneb back, paid, putrid, dead, flat, false, missed, liar, quiet, beyatrer, content, etc, etc, etc.This is by far the worst U2 era, being nothing but decade of decadence.Please Bono learn how to sing with your damaged and drunk voice, thanks"
3,"Nothing new, but beautiful anyway","In my opinion, this album continues the style found on ""All that you can't leave behind"". It is classic U2, I like it. It is not what all other U2 albums were: completely new stuff."
3,How To Manufacture A Hit Album,"Initial reviews are wildly overrating this above-average offering, which harks back to U2's early guitar sound but amps up the intelligence quotient of the lyrics. This is so accessible, however, that its long-term wear prospects may be questionable. ""Vertigo"" is a fun first single, but it may be too catchy to last very long before listeners get sick of it. It doesn't hold up as well as its counterpart, ""It's A Beautiful Day,"" from U2's previous CD. Some say this CD sounds like ""The Joshua Tree,"" but I'm not hearing the comparison. This is more energetic and, therefore, may possibly not have very long legs. The guitar playing of the Edge is very good here, to be sure. And Bono actually sounds younger than he did four years ago. ""Bomb"" does flow pretty seamlessly, and it makes for a pleasant listen, just maybe not one you'll still be listening to a year from now."
1,All That U2 Can't Leave Behind,"This is just a mindless album. It is a desperate attempt to try to parody earlier recordings. However, after two tracks it starts to blend into one of the worst U2 songs ever - Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own - that just does not seem to be going anywhere. Periodically there are shameless attempts at pop commercial singles. I have never been more let down from a band then I was by the so-called ""U2"" on this one.How could one explain how shallow and meaningless their music became after All That You Can't Leave Behind ? They gave up on art and opted for being ROCK ICONS, a damnable pity if there ever was one.If I were 80s Bono I would be embarrassed to even be associated with the ( now commercialized ) name U2, who unfairly subjected us to this torture they call a ""U2"" record....takes a second to say goodbye say goodbye oh oh oh"
1,How to dismantle a solid career in under 60 minutes...,"Never thought I'd say this of a U2 album... this is truly a TURD. Embarrasingly simple-minded and boring, uninspired... just dreadful. What happened?Oh, how the mighty fall. They've gone full circle from influencing Coldplay to being influenced BY and sounding like Coldplay. And that just isn't a good thing in my book."
1,the song remains the same,"how to dismantle an atomic bomb is just a contract album coated in stupid mellow, muted tones that aim for the languid atmospherics of, say, Air, but instead achieve a state of lite-rock somnambulism. The whole album is nothing but a remix of all that you can't leave behind. I can't stand that this ""new"" album sounds like a rewrite of its 2000 highly overrated predecessor, which itself was a pulseless way to spend a listening 49 minutes.I don't know which thing is the most unoriginal: the album or the vertigo tour.One thing I'm sure of: They're completely afraid to change and they're not going to really test fans with the kind of fantastic diversion that resulted with Zooropa and POP.U2 are now another dated nostalgia act, very uneven for a rock band that defined order and art in the glory 90s.Sellouts."
2,VERY MELLOW...,"OK, ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND got many mellow moments, but got some U2 gems...This one trully got 1 track VERTIGO...the rest of this atomic bomb is a lot of EXTREMELLY sentimental songs...Edge guitars are good as always, but BONO lyrics are very mellow and all the stuffs turns to be way too soft...Not one of the best by the great U2..."
1,Why did this album get a grammy award?,"It's because the music industries have hit the all-time low since no one can make good music anymore. They have no one to choose, so they ended up choosing U2 as a winner. If that album was produced in 1982, it would have been banned by the music industry and would immediately get thrown out.This U2 album is the worst I've ever heard in my life."
4,U2 doing what they know best: great music.,"I remember one guy saying back in the mid 80's that U2 could become the next Beatles. In time, they really didn't and we came to understand that the Beatles were unique. But what U2 did become is the coooooolest band in the world. OK, the Stones are ""bigger"", but U2 are the coolest (they even have their own ultracool iPod). So what could U2, after more than 20 years, need to prove or experiment? This album is plain, good ol' , fun, kicking rock n' roll at it's best. The album does follow the stablished 1-2 of rock, that is release a great album (All That You Can't...) and then repeat the recepie (for example: Red Hot Chili Peppers-Californication-and then-By The Way). The end result is great. ""Atomic Bomb"" will not change music history, but it's good to know that Rock n' Roll is alive and well. Overall, it's one of U2s best albums, highly recommended."
4,What that guy below me said :),"The reviewer Quiros from Costa Rica below me had very good sum up of this record. Adam & Edge = perfection. Bono struggles here sometimes with his voice but I dont have problems with lyrics. They are not the same band as they were in the Joshua Tree days, so Bono cant talk ""bullet the blue sky"". It seems Bono is stuck in this pop phase. it seems the band wanted to break out into a more harder rock format and it was brought back to a more pop/rock format because of bono's songwriting nowadays. It is still very powerful album, not what I was expecting but good. U2 still have the capabilities to do many good things and making a good album is one of them. Sorry for my English. :)"
1,Not so good.,"A long-time U2 fan. I saw them when I was a student when they were playing the Hammersmith Odeon in London. There are only two good tracks on this album. ""Vertigo"" and ""Sometimes you can`t make it on your own"", although the second is beginning to sound like a repetitive theme. Vertigo is excellent, original sound and production, when I first heard it I loved it, not even knowing it was U2. Great energy. U2 should be embarassed about putting out such a mediocre album. Doesn`t anyone tell them, ""hey.. that is not actually a good enough song to put out"". I was in a band myself, sometimes a song was rubbish, and you just have to let it die. Not all babies are beautiful."
3,...,"My iPod made me buy the U2 album.Wait, no. U2 made me buy my iPod.Apple and Bono sitting in a tree... K.I.S.S.I.N.G..._____________Seriously though, I'm not a big U2 fan (example: my favorite U2 album is POP) but this is a decent collection of songs once you eliminate track one and eleven. I can see how die hard U2 fans might find this one a bit weak. But they've been saying that about every album since Boy. Aicharumba!"
5,"Not their best, but really good","I've been a U2 fan since the days of War and Boy and October and find myself wondering why people come to Amazon and pull out their bloated intellects and big words to tear down a band that has been a source of inspiration and countless hours of musical wonderment to fans for nearly 3 decades!It's a good album, it's not their best, but it is earnest and genuine and a worthwhile purchase."
4,"its The edge , The Edge, The Edge",why 4 stars becasue there are better albums (even U2 has better ones) - why not 3 becasue this is a product of a group which has matured and knows what they are doing. Listen it once - then again and then again - listen to the lyrics and how the music touches the lyric and you will get hooked to it.I admire The Edge without him there would be no U2 but probably he is one of the best living guiterist but now you will listen to the Edge on the piano. He is a genius.This album is more matured and but does not lack experiment - some times Bono should tone it down a little bit - the voice is cracking too much.You will love it - I promise
5,Awesome,"Well, safe to say these guys won't stop reinventing themselves. But this time they went back to their roots and fine tuned them with the result being perhaps their most solid album. Overall, ""Sometimes you Can't Make It On Your Own,"" ""Vertigo,"" and ""All Because of You"" are the best tracks, but all are good. I highly recommend it."
4,An aging but changing band,"U2's latest effort appears to be heading in a new direction. Whether that's good or not, we don't yet know. After their last several releases, they seemed to be floundering without direction. No, ""How to Dismantle . . ."" is NOT the old U2. How many of us are the same way we were in the 70's and 80's? After listening to this album many times, I am beginning to hear something new and different. It still sounds like U2, but there are fresh ideas, new riffs, and a new kind of writing that I hope will continue in future recordings. I'm sure glad they're doing more than touring around the country playing ""Under A Blood Red Sky"" over and over and over."
4,"Hate the Title, Love the Record","It took me awhile to get around to picking this one up. I kept trying to erase the tune Vertigo from my memory banks, but to no avail. I finally succumbed and slapped down my plastic. After the blandness of POP and the clever-cleverness of Everything You Can't Leave Behind, I was expecting a couple singles and a bunch of basic under-produced downers. I was happily surprised. Bono has re-taken control over the better part of the lyrics to great effect. Listen to Larry's wonderful drumming on ""Miracle Drug,"" and Adam's bass on ""City of Blinding Lights""...Smashing! The Edge usually delivers brilliance, but the riffs for ""Yahweh"" are exquisite, and move me more than any playing I've heard for quite some time. Although this album revisits some of the sonic landscapes u2 have taken us to before, they painted those landscapes in the first place, and Im happy to see them again..."
4,Vertigo,"The overall album is solid, but has anyone noticed that the chorus to ""Vertigo"" is virtually identical to the Supremes hit ""You Keep Me Hanging On"" - preview it on Amazon and compare the two songs."
4,Music Lover,"When I listened to this album the first time I didn't have too many expectations. Maybe that's the problem with U2 they're so big that people expect more. No this album is not like the 80's and 90's but if it was everyone would say they do the same thing all the time. What makes bands the best is their ability to continually create new and different music. This is exactly why they are being inducted into the hall of fame. This album is good from start to end, how many are like that these days? Think about it. Punk rock can't do that too often. There's a reason U2 has been around this long. Blink 182, Jimmy Eat World, etc. etc. how long will they really be around? This album is great for sitting back and just chilling. If you are a real music lover and can progress with the times you will like this album."
5,the 5th album of u2 (as if),"It seems to me like being the 5th album of U2.When I am listening to these songs (and I do listen to them over and over again), it seems to me that this is the 5th album in their discography. It seems to me like having been recorded before the Joshua Tree, but as if they (Bono and co.) had to go through all the work from Joshua to ATYCLB to write such songs.I love it. It is not very good, it is great."
4,A GOOD U2 ALBUM.,"U2's latest album is best music and has some of the greatest songs featuring Vertigo, Love and Peace, and City Of Blinding Lights. Buy this great latest album. Bono writes good lyrics."
3,Decent Effort,"U2 has been a big break through with this big commerical album of their singles ""Vertigo"", ""All Because of You"" and ""Sometimes you can't make it on your own"". Yeah i like the singles but after that their is some other goods I like but this isn't their best effort."
1,ALL THAT U2 CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND,"Embarrassing. This album for me actually earned the dubious distinction of being worse than ATYCLB, which was a distinction not easily earned.Listen to Achtung Baby or Pop, then listen to this, and you too will feel the pain of disappointment.U2 play it safe once again, and that's almost completely unrecognizable as one of the most innovative bands in the 90s.The whole albums sounds too mechanized. this is simply a weak carbon-copy of ATYCLB that doesn't manage to notch any major hits and ends up sounding completely unexciting and overly commercial.If you are a casual U2 fan and if you have a brain and you don't run to the nearest music store trying to get every new s*** promoted on MTV or Rolling Stone as ""masterpiece"" you will find this an insulting piece of unmemorable iPod crap."
1,Ladies and Gentlemen: The worst of U2,"This is the worst side of U2, by Far. Cynical, lack of honesty, liar, cheap, recyled, commercial, avaricious... comfortably numbTHEY'VE BECOME COMFORTABLY NUMBOverall this boring soup is for iPod commercials and grammy awards, not for die hard fans like me.They have settle down in the world of the commercialization, supported by easy teens fans.Some fans don't mind about Bono's performance. He can't sing anymore, he doesn't have a half a voice he had in the 80's. And still some fans believe that fake words ""80's U2 is back"", ""They returned to the basic sound"" and blah blah.LOVE IS BLINDNESS... don't you remember ? do you ?They didn't make an album here, they only cloned All That You Can't Leave Behind... is that ""THE BEST U2 ALBUM"" ?... come on, we're not stupid !!I prefer 1000 times to donate money for Africa AIDS rather than buy this nastiness."
1,SORRY I BOUGHT IT.,"I love the song VERTIGO, but that's where it stops. The rest of the album DOES NOT ROCK. More esoteric crapola from the epitome of arrogant eurotrash. Those who have been on the U2 strokewagon, it's way past time to get off. One STAR for Vertigo, and a big THUMBS DOWN on U2."
2,Dinosaurs get old too,"Here a point, people; Artist who are in the cover picture of their albums often suck, and boy, I'm right. U2 can play solid poprokc and they made great music back in the day, but now they have nothing new to offer. Their music is as old as Bono's sunglasses! This album is so corny and boring, that omg! ""Vertigo"", the grunge-influenced powerpop track is kinda sweet but the rest blows!WHO SHOULD BUY THIS: TRUE U2 FANS WHO DON'T THINK THEY EVER GET OLDWHO SHOULDN'T BUY THIS: EVERYONE EXCEPT TRUE U2 FANSsimple as that"
4,What is wrong with you americans?,"I definitely agree that this is not their best album, but what the hell is wrong with you americans. All that 1 stars, all that extreme negatively about this record.Look at the reviews on the english and the german amazon.com, they are significantly more positive. I guess that the record is too complicated for a lot of you americans."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Really not very interesting at all. Socially conscious lyrics sans ooooomph. I really haven't liked much U2 has done since ""Achtung Baby""."
5,U2 Soar with Atomic Bomb,"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb comes in three varieties:1. regular2. deluxe (this edition)3. book & CDThis version gives you the bonus CD, which is pretty good. Interesting little documentary about the album, some videos and a clever performance of Vertigo. As stated in my review of the ""regular"" edition, the Bomb rocks. Definately add it. But perhaps fork out a few bucks more, get the book edition and get ""Fast Cars"" too."
1,Too short and filler DVD,"I'm not going to review the album, I'm only going to review this ""deluxe"" edition. The DVD appeared here is just filler stuff, like the one appeared on Best Of 1990-2000. The short documentary is boring and goes nowhere. The songs presented ""live"" are nothing interesting. Overall, go with standard edition instead."
3,1 song did it all,"I wanted this CD for one reason. For the song Vertigo, and that's about it.I like U2, don't get me wrong. But it's like they put all there work in to the 1st two songs and that was it. Plus sometimes I think Bono needs a slap in the Back of the head. I recomend this CD to people who like the song Vertigo, I guess it's kinda worth it."
1,All That You Can't Leave Behind - Part 2,What has happened to the band that used to try hard to produce something different and exciting? This album is totally devoid of new tune.....of new direction...of new anything. They have become the epitome of corporate rock.
1,One of the greatest bands in history...should hang it up!,"I am 32 years old and have followed U2 since the first time I saw the video for Gloria many years ago. The Unforgettable Fire, The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby basically form the soundtrack to my life. U2 is truly the most important band to me. Having said that...How to Dismantle is by far the most lame effort they have made. I seriously want my money back. This is horrible. I can't believe they are trying to pass this off as any kind of credible effort. I thought that 'All that you can't leave behind' was a very commendable and relevant recording. It showed that they were still a band worth following. Well if their latest recording is the best they have to offer then they need to retire. It's like an all-star athlete who just can't quit so they end their career with several years of mediocrity. 'One Step Closer' is a good tune! That's it!!"
2,Crap,"""Vertigo"" is a decent song, with a hook in it. The rest of the album - I suffered through it once - is dispensible second-rate crap. U2 ceased to be anything original or even vaguely interesting a long time ago.Their synthesis of Patti Smith, Simple Minds, Public Image Ltd, Echo and the Bunneymen, and Bruce Springsteen became codified decades ago and the horrible crap they propogate as music is duller than Lawrence Welk ever managed to be."
1,"Avoid this so-called ""Grammy Worthy"" CD","Can someone explain how a once great band (see their CD's Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby) has the ability to win music awards based solely on their likability by the music industry, rather than the actual music produced? This CD is so painfully awful, I dare anyone, and I mean anyone to listen to it more than one time.To find overlooked Grammy deserving artists CD's from last year, pick up either Black Lab - See The Sun or Collective Soul - Youth. Their music speaks for itself."
1,fans asking save the bomb says it all,"why so many fans don't want to see what's really happening and admit that this album is a failure, no matter whichever copies it will sell ? why they denies in recognizing that U2 has been mistaken ?. The reviews here gives clear and forceful vision about this fake ""bomb"": it's an excrement. Period. The cause that fans asking friends and forum members to ""save The Bomb"" it's a desperate act trying to give a much better image to an album that is a artistic [...]. At least 50% of 5 stars here belongs to that desperate ""save the Bomb"" campaign."
5,Classic U2 CD,"After 25 years, U2 is still hungry. This CD deserves to be placed among the band's best works. Vertigo is a great rocker and a neat opener. There's anumber of classic U2 cuts here such as All Because of You, Sometimes you can't make it on your own, and A man and a woman.Is this u2's best CD? They have made so many good ones that it's going to be a matter of opinion but I would rank this just slightly below Achtung Baby and slightly above their earlier work in the first half of the 1980's. Any way you cut it, this is a fine vintage work."
2,Pass on it if you're not a hard core U2 fan,"My sentiments exactly, after hearing the the rockin' ""Vertigo"" with the ""old school"" U2 sound - outstanding Edge riffs seamlessly complimented by Adam's bass and finally letting Larry what he does best, playing something other than a 1-2 tempo - the rest of the album is very mellow and unfortunately, not in a ""Unforgettable Fire"" sort of way.I did find the music reminding me of earlier U2 and just listening to their unique and layered sound makes this a satisfying album. However, I found the biggest difference was Bono. For someone who seems to have boundless energy and seems to be all over the world promoting his beliefs and political views, his energy is non-existent on this album; or shall I say, subdued.How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is like watching U2 live in concert with Bono singing from a Lazy Boy chair. The music's there, best the vocals aren't."
2,"Bland, uninspiring effort","""All That You Can't Leave Behind"" was a great comeback for U2, and their first consistently good effort since ""Rattle and Hum"". Unfortunately, the comeback didn't last long -- ""How to Dismantle An Atom Bomb"" is stale, formulaic U2-lite, rendered by a band that seemingly has run out of ideas. Even the return of Steve Lillywhite as U2's producer fails to spark any magic. Oh, for the days of ""War"" and ""The Joshua Tree""."
3,Disappointing,"The lyrics suck. Bono should be embarassed.""Tough. You think you've got the stuff.""""Listen to me now. I need to let you know.""Weak, weak, weak. Embarrassing lyrics. I give it three stars because it at least ""sounds like U2"", and that ain't all bad.Also--where's the vocal bravado in the lower ranges of his voice? It's very thin these days."
1,Recycling,"They've lost it. No imagination, no new ideas, just recycling older material. Same lyrical treatment, same production skills. Some of their '90s albums even sound more modern. This proves two things: 1) They've run out of creativity, 2) They're just in it for the money now. Sad."
3,Bland Songs With Forced Emotion,"Critics seem to automatically give a band or artist a very good review simply because of the band and not necesarrily because of the music they make. U2 is one of those bands. Critics have hailed this as an excellent album. How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is nothing of the sort. The songs, while well-written, lack a lot of the natural emotion heard and felt in classic U2 songs. The lyrics are all different, but Bono seems to be saying the same thing on all eleven tracks. He seems to have traded in his soaring powerful vocal delivery heard in more recent songs like Walk On and If God Will Send His Angels for a more tender, almost whiny vocal delivery. Highlights of the album include City of Blinding Lights, All Because of You, and Vertigo. As a whole, I think this album will be forgotten."
2,A major disappointment,"U2's latest effort is a major disappointment, particularly when coming off the heels of All That You Can't Leave Behind. In retrospect, what could the band have done to improve on what they have already released? The tracks here, short of Vertigo, are slow, ill-paced and repititous. Vertigo, the ""iPod"" single, is itself very repititous and meandering, although it does maintaint an upbeat presence missing on the rest of the album. This is an album for only die-hard U2 fans. Don't buy into the hype if you are actually looking for ongoing, listenable music. Try All That You Can't Leave Behind or The Joshua Tree as much better examples of what this band is capable of (even Pop is a better album than this)."
3,a life changing album?,"I enjoyed this album and can't wait for the tour. I can't wait for the album to grow on me. But a life changing album? Anyone who believes that rwill be crushingly disappointed. Don't let yourself be misled into believing this album will change your very existence on the planet- they're just four Irish guys with bad taste in sunglasses who make great music, and have managed to hold it all together over the years."
4,"Not their best, but still a really good CD","How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb was the kind of CD that takes a few listens to really get into it. While a few of the songs are instant classics, at first listen the CD sounded somewhat mediocre, especially in the 2nd half after the suprisingly cool track A Man and A Woman. However, it's really grown on me as I begin to appreciate the nuances of every song.It's not a perfect CD; the last two tracks or so don't do much for me and I feel that even the best moments don't soar as high as the best moments of the classic albums like Acthung Baby or Joshua Tree. But second-tier U2 is better than most of what's out there. The CD is a definite keeper."
2,Definitely not a rock album,"I had high hopes for U2's latest CD especially after hearing the blistering title track, Vertigo. Thinking it was just a preview of things to come, I was surprisingly disappointed. Tracks are mellow, too mellow, and made me want to fast forward to the next song until I reached the end of the CD. This is supposed to be a rock album? Doesn't sound like it to me. By far the best track is the opener, Vertigo, and Miracle Drug kind of grows on you but I can't say the same for the rest of the album. Let's just say that if any other band was releasing this CD, people's reactions would be far more restrained. Also, I felt ripped off that the lyrics weren't included and the special edition is not worth spending the extra money on unless you want to see an outline of all the band members' hands."
2,Looses flavor.,"You know what? I really liked this album at first, through electrolysis, but even the hits loose their flavor after a few listens, a rudimentary synopsis of a general scope of the symbols' meanings. Which means they have exceeded the speed of light 100-fold. It was a nice try, but this is, so to speak, no ""Pop Mart"" not even a ""Rattle & Hum."""
3,Very safe album....only a few good songs,"ATYCLB was much better. There are about 3 songs on this one that stand out. Other than that, a very safe, listener friendly album that doesn't push any boundaries."
2,"Album was fair, but disappointing...","I liked some of the songs, but they sounded a like. Not as much power as I am used to hearing from U2, so I was disappointed when I bought the CD. I gave it to My brother in law, thats how much I disliked it."
2,Nothing succeds like mediocrity,"On this latest U2 recording Onob still sounds like he still hasn't found what he's looking for. Boring rehashed music with trite lyrical themes alot of which seem like Hallmark card versions of something Bob Dylan could do much better. Overrated, Overdramatic, Overproduced Weepy music for Babies!"
1,1 Star Is Too Much,"WARNING!!!!!!: This album lacks everything a album should have, musically and lyrically. I hate this crap. This is a great Christmas gift to someone you really hate and wish they would die, but to be polite just get them this album and consider them doomed.Consider yourself warned"
2,A better title would have been-,"How to dismantle a tired band - tired title concept, tired sound to the band. They know the drill, they have the formula, but lost the spirit. Please people, stop feeding these pan handlers."
4,Comfortable Middle Age,"U2 will probably never quite be on the cutting edge again. But they seemed to have found a perfect groove for their middle age. Much like Bowie has done on his last two albums, U2 is now content with recombining sounds from their previous albums to create quality new songs. While this won't create anything spectacularly new, it's a fine way to keep up a long term career in rock. Most of the music here does evoke earlier songs (maybe too much with ""Miracle Drug"") but there are few misses here (""Yahweh"" comes to mind as a failed song). The rockers here seem to do best, and ""Vertigo"" and ""City of Blinding Lights"" are top shelf U2. U2's adventurousness may be lost forever, but maybe adventurousness is for the younger bands. In their roll as rock statesmen, U2 are doing well."
4,Atomic Bomb,"I enjoyed this album very much. It does not have as many memorable songs as 'All that you can't leave behind', however."
4,These 1-Star Reviews make me laugh,"What a joke. Let me break down these reviewers. They are either people who hate the band and will never like any of their material, people who hate u2 and haven't even heard the album, or are u2 fans who aren't happy with the new direction. If it's the last one, then it's insulting to give it only 1 star. Outrageous!! This is not u2's best album, its very good but does not touch the UNFORGETTABLE FIRE or JOSHUA TREE. Still, it is better than 97% of the other music that's out in the world today. So I'm happy about the new u2 release, everyone relax."
2,U2 or alien shapeshifters?,"I want to know what these imposters have done with the real U2. Have they been kidnapped and replaced by no-talent, mindless shape-shifting alien beings? or have they just lost their touch? Whatever it is, I hope their next album can dismantle this atomic bomb."
2,Atomic Stink Bomb,"Near the end of last year Bono had stated that their next cd was nearly completed but delayed the release a year because something was ""missing"" Well, it still holds true. if you're looking for another Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby you will have to wait another 4 years, because HTDAAB has more in common with Rattle and Hum and Pop. the songs on HTDAAB remind me of ATYCLB re-treads. Bono's lyrics seem somewhat contrived and his vocals lost in the mix. HTDAATB is a compilation of sounds from previous u2 material. nothing new here; what a shame- have been waiting for another classic from these guys since Achtung Baby. Still haven't found what i am looking for......"
1,When I look At U2,"When I look At U2I see dollars, I see commercials, I see lies, I see sold out men, I see drinks, I see fishing, I see mainstream, I see arrogance, I see rented songs and sounds, I see emptyness, I see rubbish, I see forgotten honesty, I see entertainment, I see iPod, I see fake interviews and news, I see discrimination, I see George Bush, I see dissapointment, I see alienation, I see spitting, I see stupidity, I see greed, I see rotten downing era, I see materialism, I see marketing, I see stores, I see Rolling Stone, I see Grammy Awards, I see over-production, I see falsity, I see cockies, I see tricks, I see factory...I see nothing from the U2 I loved... and I was on Rockpalast festival 1983"
2,Disappointing effort,"I am a long-time, big-time U2 fan and I am very disappointed with this CD. Part of the reason may be in that the pre-release hype was that this CD would rock a little harder than the last couple of efforts. It doesn't. When I first heard Vertigo, I thought it was an okay tune, far from U2's best, but I still had hope for the CD. There are some better songs than Vertigo on the CD, but in all the songs are fairly weak. Most of the songs sound like they were rejected from early U2 albums. You can hear hints of earlier works in many of the songs, but they just aren't as good as the earlier works.The biggest problem with the CD is that most of the songs are overproduced. There is some good guitar, bass and drum work going on, but the solid musicianship is drowned out by too much irriating synthesizer effects, hallelujah choruses, and repetitive keyboard work. The end result is that I feel like I am listening to the soundtrack of a Broadway musical."
1,r u serious?,Do people truly listen to this and like it? I thought it was the most wretched CD I have ever heard! Where are the blast beats? Where are the lightning fast guitar solos? Where are the interludes? I think the band members must be on heroin or something. Whoever allowed this mess to get into stores should be killed.
1,only one good song on the whole CD,The only song worth anything on this cd is Vertigo other than that it blows!! This band has seen better days and is releying on their name only to sell cd's and not their abilities. They should of called it a day a long time ago.
2,This is what happens when you play it safe,"I'm very disappointed in this album. The Edge is dull. I'm a huge fan of the band, but outside of Vertigo it's an album of B-grade U2.It's not much of a rocker. I'm sure FM radio will love it, but FM radio programming sucks.They aren't progressing with this album, just maintaining. Best band in the world?...Not if you phone it in like this thing does.I've tried and tried to ""make"" it grow on me, it's not working."
1,"Weak, weak, weak","U2's weakest release. This one ranks below 1997's POP. It's really bad, and that's a shame because ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND was so good. But really, ""Uno, dos, tres . . . catorce?"" You have to cringe when you hear that. Yes, Bono is a great singer. No, Bono can't count to four in Spanish. Give me a break."
3,All That You Can't Leave Behind II,"The thing I like about U2 is that they are always trying something new. Each album was a new direction for them and they weren't afraid to go out on a limb. For this reason I tolerated Bono's massive ego and insipid attempts to save the world but it is all getting a bit much now. As everyone else has said, this album is nothing new, and it isn't. In fact, the last album was nothing new. In my opinion U2 should have cut half of the songs from all that you can't leave behind and cut half of the songs from this album and put them together. Then you would've had one good album. There are great songs on this album but most of them are slow meditative songs like city of blinding light or miracle drug. Where is the rock? Where is the guitar? Also, there is a fine line between talking about spirituality and preaching. Bono is walking that line and it is getting a bit tiresome."
2,Not what they promised.,"This is'nt the album U2 promised so no wonder everyones so dissapointed, not to mention it is a bit dissapoiting.They've got one more chance to make""The old rock n roll U2 updated - sounding album.""and reinstall themselves as the biggest and best band in the world, and not just in popularity - I mean musically.And we better not have to wait 4 years for it!!!Besides they're not as young as they used to be.For U2s last ""good"" album check out ""POP."" and don't buy this, its really a big dissapointment."
1,today`s U2 = music business,The title is stupid.Cover is ridiculous.Music incredible monotone and dull.No passion playing.They just a trying to cash in at any musical cost.That is not acceptable.
1,*sigh*,"Now I am not a U2 fan at all, and I've never listened to their stuff before.However, I heard Vertigo and I LOVED it. So what did I do? I went out and bought the CD with a giftcard I got for christmas.Yeah that was a mistake. Vertigo is a great song, but I hated the rest of them. I was hoping the rest of the CD would be as upbeat and as powerful as Vertigo, but it was all soft slower calmer music, and I didn't like it at all."
1,how to dismantle a great band,"this album should have been called how to dismantle a great band, because that what this album is. U2 ruin and put in a corner their career with this arrogant and safe Rock star album. U2 throw 11 artificial songs, making this album more like a sketch of theirselves. U2 loose their compass with this hype shifting their past direction of innovation to inoffensive, commercial and inert music for the charts."
1,For Love or Money ?...,"After 10 listenings...answer is simple: For Money.I can't believe this. U2, a well known and very respected band, making such a disaster of album for money, only money. And the fans swallow the merchandise, like always. WAKE UP, WAKE UP DEAD FANS. U2 can left all their past behind, can leave all attempt to make music behind, all honesty, all messages, all activism, all passion, but the only thing they can't leave behind is MONEY.Many of these songs are clear signs that U2 are now long in tooth.I feel embarresed while listening to this new U2 album. This album is nauseatingly bad to anyone who knows just a bit about how to write songs and create music.If being a ""U2 fan"" means being a blindly adoring fanboy , I'm not a U2 fan. But actually I'm a die hard U2 fan !!! but I can't stand listening this ""nice"" U2, sorry."
1,WHAT THE HELL IS THIS,"Tell me, WHAT was going through Bono and Co.'s head when they wrote this pile? WAIT! Before you immediately vote ""not hwlpful"", I'm a U2 fan, that's why this album upset me so much. U2 have done the immpossible: They sld out worse thanMetallica (and that's saying something). Anyone who rates this over 1 star should be gicen ""Atchung baby"" ASAP! 'Nuff said."
5,Wow what an album!!!!!,"Lets go track by track1.

1,"All is the same old, same rotten formula","Most of these boring songs (even the decent ones...which are far and few between) take forever to get going. In most of the songs, Bono sounds tired...like he's an aging rockstar who can't quite hit the notes like he used to. A lot of the melodies are mundane and meandering while the lyrics are pointless. A lot of the music isn't distinct either. The Edge seems to be making up the guitar parts as he goes along on some songs and borrowing from bits-and-pieces of old U2 songs some of the others.There's a ton of piano/keyboards on this puppy...too much if you ask me. In fact, a lot of these songs sound more like B-side tracks. Very disappointing!. Where's the song-writing ability here ?Tired music, tired singing. This is the laziest U2 album ever.Time to quit U2, really."
1,Rubbish album.,"The music and songs are really bland.Awful, terrible album.the ""real"" U2 is dead.Last ""actual"" release by U2 - ""POP"""
2,"ok, whatever","I have never liked U2 very much, and this album reaffirms why. The production on this album is just a mess, I am SO glad I didn't buy it. I would say that ""vertigo"" and ""all because of you"" are reasonable efforts, but I would never consider buying them, I just listen to them a bit on the radio. What an overhyped band!! If you want to check them out in a time when they made interesting music, get the Joshua Tree album. That is the only necessary U2 purchase in my book, besides maybe All That You Can't Leave Behind, except I think that album is pretty boring also, but not nearly as boring as this lame cd!"
1,Playing it too safe.,"Well, the members of U2 have finally sold out by playing it safe and stopped being creative with their music in this new album. All the songs are tepid, weak and lack passion from their previous albums such as Joshua Tree and Actung Baby. I even liked their ""Pop"" album because I enjoyed the new direction they were taking with their music with touches of electronica and with a certain type of groove. This has all ended now and maybe it time for the band to retire at the South of France. I'm sorry I have played it twice and already I am bored!"
3,Not up to Snuff,"Perhaps it is due to Bono's unending effort to save the poor in Africa. Perhaps it is Larry and Adam's seemingly increasing disdain for Rock Stardom (at least the part where you have to interact with those who pay your salary or act like you give a crap when performing live). Or perhaps the Edge has just run out of ideas. Apparently they cut the wrong wire when trying to dismantle this bomb of an album. Don't get me wrong, Vertigo, Sometimes You Can't Make it, and All Because of You are better than average songs, but overall this CD is lame, uninteresting and tedious to listen to start to finish. The whole buying into Apple/Ipod thing apparently has U2 thinking about shooting for 2-3 good tracks per CD to be downloaded. The rest is filler worthy of far lesser bands."
4,An underrated album,"U2 returns with their hardest sound in years. Not since the early nineties has U2 been so electric on an album. ""Vertigo,"" ""All because of you"" and ""Love and peace or else"" are great rock songs. And the rest of the album is a terrific mixture of pop and soul. So I was surprised to see these mixed reveiws. While it's not a classic U2 album like All That You Can't Leave Behind it's certainly worth listening to and enjoying."
3,What can we say?,"Its hard to be hard on U2 for anything these days as they have perservered over the years. I have to say that this albumn appears to be a culmination of increasing christian influence on Bono's life in his later years. I think he is coming to terms with his success, and wonders why out of all the people in the world he ended up so well off. I like they albumn but I am having difficulty finding a song on there that truly moves me like ""One"" or ""Kite"". In those songs the lyrics expressed themselves naturally. In these songs, they feel forced on you. Like the emphasis was on the lyrics and message and not on the music. I kind of get the feeling that the rest of the band kind of hung back in the shadows when this was being made, and basically its Bono's and Edges albumn. Listen to it and make up your own mind. I like it, but I pray they haven't jumped the shark."
2,U2 tired&Predictable,"I use to really dig U2 back in the day,but somewhere in the early 90's U2 got into this Over the top type of Music Making which distance themselves from the Good Songwriting they use to present back in the 80's. they have become so contrived&now they are like a Act that just shows up in Name only.this album is Average at best. not a single knock-Out cut."
5,Awesome album,"I think this is a great album. I have listened to it several times and I enjoy it very much. I have read some of the reviews from supposed ""Fans"" that have given this album 1 or 2 stars, I think they are all wrong and obviously not true fans like they say! This is one of U2's best albums."
4,Good album,This is a good u2 album. Don't pay attention to the people writing a whole essay of how U2 are sell outs and that there legacy is over on their review. I agree its not there best but some of these reviews that take shots at bono just cause hes on top are incredibly humorous.
1,More of the same crap,Maybe you 5 star people like wasting your money on such a crap album but how many times are you going to listen to it?. There is nothing on this album that you haven't heard before. Listen to Pop instead.
2,more like 2 1/2 stars,"I've been a U2 fan since the age of 11 (1983) and I really was looking forward to the new album.... There are a few well-written songs on here but overall the album leaves me cold. Overall I think this is the lyrically weakest U2 album ever. In addition, out of all their albums, this one has the strongest vibe of being commercially calculated - it's like the underlying spirit of their music has been sucked out. I have listened to the whole album 3 times so far and sadly my impression hasn't improved. For newcomers to U2 (are there such people?) - more of the songs may be seem fresh, but to me they are just musical retreads of lyrically superior songs on other albums. Borrow this from a friend first (or listen to the songs streamed on the band's website) - and then buy Franz Ferdinand's debut album instead."
4,Not their best but very solid,"I have been seeing this album getting panned and compared to their 80's work. This now 20 years later and they have decided to strip down and do a rock album. This is one of the things that appeals to me. The sound is more raw then it has been in years, their playing is on the top of their game. Sure the writting is not Bono's best and it's not political or sociall concious. I think they were going for a straight rock and roll album. The song does get a little more on the religious side, All Becuase of You and Yahweh, than in the past.With that being the case this is one of their best albums (the only realy really terrible one being Pop). I would recommend this album to any U2 fan. My favorite song on this album is the one that everyone has been panning. Love and Peace or Else great blues riff with interesting textures."
4,Best Album of 2004?,"I don't know about all that, it gets great competition from the likes of Franz Ferdinand ""Self-Titled"", Interpol ""Antics"", and maybe Velvet Revolver ""Contraband"" gets some consideration. But even if ""the bomb"" is or isn't, it still is evidence that U2 have the skills good enough to make great music, which pleases Edge-Clayton-Mullen. It is also enough for U2 to hold on to the title of biggest band on the planet, which pleases Bono."
2,U2 fans... two different camps,"After ""ATYCLB"" and now this new disc I'm convinced there are two different types of U2 fans. There are those who came to U2 from a punk/alternative/experimental camp... the people who still want to hear new bands today like Franz, Interpol, Secret Machines, etc. Then there are those U2 fans who got into them by hearing their songs on Top 40 and Classic Rock radio. People who are generally satisfied with anything spoon fed to them.I can see no other way how it's possible any U2 fan who got into them for their intensity, fire and creativity can honestly care about this music. I don't know what is more depressing, so many fans fawning over milked-over mediocrity or actually hearing the guys in the band talk so strongly of this work (truly, it is WORK listening as well). I never dreamed I'd see REM and U2 turn into today's Rolling Stones."
4,Vertigo - What goes around comes around,This is the album I've been waiting for since Boy and October - a refreshing departure from Zoo TV. It's like going back to church. Weakness: some dead spots and some odd lyrics.
4,Beautiful songs!,"U2 has given us a gift with this album. They have again produced a record that speaks volumes about their life's journey, and offers a glimpse to where they would like to take us in the future. I for one hope to tag along."
4,Initial Review- HTDAAB,"My first reaction to the CD was mixed but the more I listen, the more I find to appreciate and have no doubts that there will be quite a few people with early negative reviews that will have a change of heart soon. ""City of Blinding Lights"" alone was worth every cent I paid for the disk. As a few others have mentioned a U2 album always seems to have a way of growing on you and changing overtime.I bought the Deluxe edition with the DVD, thinking the three tracks on the DVD would be remixes. They're not, just acoustic versions and U2 playing the songs in their studio."
4,Collector's Edition Book Bites,"I love the new U2 album. The DVD is fantastic. But the book bites. It's like the band played with finger paint for a couple hours, then published the mess. Very little material in it other than the sketches and weird paintings. No background historical information like with the Police box set. Save your money and buy the Limited Edition version ""How to Dismantle and Atomic Bomb"" with the DVD and the CD. That version is even cheaper at Target ($15 in the store). To pay $30 and get this lousy book puts a bad taste in my mouth about the whole purchase."
5,Bono and The Other U2 Guys,"I'm tired of the negative reviews. Bono's voice and The Edge's guitar, Larry's drumming and Adam's bass ALWAYS turns me on. ;) They have since the early 80's when I was in Jr HS! The boys have soul. That's something they will never lose."
5,what the?,"People keep commenting on Coldplay, U2 is 20 years ahead of coldplay and they'll have to retire before Coldplay takes over. even the Killers lead singer said they are the best act in the world and so did Chris Martin for that matter. Take it from teh pro's who even say U2 is the world's best band. This is an era of U2 still, but one day Coldplay will have it, but not now. Plus, Coldplay's music sounds almost exactly like U2's music. (Miracle Drug)(Speed of Sound). Very similar at times. Either way u2 is still a great act and I can't believe all of these negative reviews."
1,BAAAAAANG,"They cut the wrong wire on this one. Overall the album stinks. The fallout from this one will affect many but there is hope. While bathing my body in iodine, I realized that I could salvage my purchase by playing the CD backwards. Needless to say it sounded a lot better. On track three (backwards)I am still wondering what ""love the robot"" means."
1,grammy voters are idiots,"How could anyone like this CD? The songs are lame, the band members are pretentious, and the whole thing just stinks. An alleycat in heat sounds better than Bono's ""singing."" A squealing pig sounds better than The Edge's guitar work."
1,U2 in a bad shape,"This album is petty. The band doesn't show any skill here. The album is remarkably commercial. THAT'S SO ANNOYING !!!U2 has no richness here, neither depth. U2 doesn't get through with this HTDAAB."
1,Jesus H Christ,"Wow what can I say about this album except its utter regurgitated rubbish. ""How to dismantle an atomic bomb?"" Jesus Christ can they flippin be a little more original with the album names. Like 50 bands between 2003-2004 release albums that had title names like..""The art of this..."", and ""The science of that"", and ""How to do more crap.."" I mean could u stop the melange of blandness already! Has anyone actually listened to or read the lyrics to Vertigo? Turns out its the most trite piece of crap lyrics I've ever read in my life. Eventhough that's pretty much the only song I've heard off this new album I get this terrible feeling that U2 has pretty much lost all their originality by now. Oh well, some things are too good to be true...U2 is was of em"
1,Don't waste your money,"First off, I have never been a U2 fan. However, when I heard vertigo, I thought I would give this album a try. After putting it into my car cd player though, I almost died in a car accident because the album bored me to sleep. Honestly, this album is downright boring. The lyrics are putrid, and the music sounds like they ripped off their other albums. If you are a fan, stay away from this turd. It may offend you so badly that you will be forced to end your existence."
1,Rattle and Hum? Ho-hum? How about No Hum?,"Once upon a time, you could count on U2 to give you 6 or 7 decent tracks on a new cd or record, 3 of which were brilliant, and 1 that amounted to a timeless gem (for example, ""New Year's Day,"" ""Bad,"" ""One Tree Hill,"" or ""One""). On this new cd, you can count zero gems, nothing brilliant, and 2 decent tracks (""Vertigo,"" and ""Yahweh"" if you can overlook the Jesus reference). A pattern has emerged: ATYCLB and HTDAAB demonstrate the lack of (and need for) propulsive bass lines and strong vocals (which Bono seems to have lost forever). Sadly, the Edge's reemergence on HTDAAB (after having gone missing on ATYCLB) isn't enough to merit repeat listening of the new cd. And so HTDAAB provides little reward for the waiting."
1,How to dismantle a legendary band,"I have a better title for this album , How to dismantle a legendary band, why? because u2 finally did it , they dropped a stinker , I kept wanting to fall asleep during this album, the lyrics were uncharacteristicly flat and meaningless for a U2 production, even that ""pop"" album they did a while back had some compelling singles, this one has no character, it is flat and depthless. there seems to be no other reason for its release other than the compelling desire to fulfill a contractual obligation. I think the other reviewers summed it up with one word, yawwn"
2,Very Disappointing!,"What a letdown! The pre-release reviews and the marketing hype had led me to believe that this release harkened back to when U2 was a rock band and played accordingly. Unfortunately, the now overplayed Vertigo is the only track on this release that lives up to the hype. Much of the release is given over to Bono's sensitive side and his need to embrace humanity (which is a separate subject and worthy of extreme praise). I just wish he would separate his role as rock and roll lead from his other agendas. Maybe Henry Rollins was correct when he said that U2 has become a band old people who forgot how to rock listen to."
2,WHY?,"Why is this band even relovent anymore? I mean if you reach an age where you want to mail it in fine, but don't expect us to buy it."
2,Not my favorite,"Okay, I'm a long time U2 fan. I like their early work _Boy_, _October_ and _War_. I also like some of the middle era work, _Actung Baby_ and _Zooropa_. Heck, every U2 CD has some good stuff. I've got 'em all, and I can't think of any that I don't like something on. On this one, I really like ""Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own"" (though it could use a shorter title.) Trouble is, I don't really like much else on this CD. Vertigo is okay, but not great.Of course your mileage may vary, but this is not one of my favorites."
5,loyalty becomes passion,"hey ekow, listening to the 'bomb'and the more i listen, the morei think this album really isup there - beyond-before-equal towith their best: achting, josh, u.fire, and war. no longer do i haveto rely on loyalty to love thisband. i am genuinely excited, nay,turned ON by u2 again and that'swhat made me fall in love with themin the first place. they make me lovelife and boy am i looking forwardto one of the best events my life hasto offer and guarantee: living and lovingwith you at camp AAG!Lay down, lay down your sweet lovedown on the track, we're gonna breakthe AAG's back!roll on our treasure: togethernesscausing havoc and obscene respectin the same town.let's stay alive for a long long time!i will followpablo kp.s. the 'bomb' is as if achtungand josh mated and gave birth!"
2,Not worth the hype,"I have been a longtime U2 fan, and this album simply fails to deliver. The opening song ""Vertigo"" is catchy, but the rest of the songs sound flat. This is an overall uninspiring album...very disappointing, given the strength of U2's last album ""All that you can't leave behind."" Let's hope their next release is better."
5,How to Dismantle a Atomic Bomb Review,"This is the 1st U2 album I bought and I'm wasb't disappointed. Some brilliant rock songs on this like Vertigo, Miracle Drug, Fast Cars and Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own. All the songs on here are really good. I can't compare it to older U2 albums but compared to other U2 songs and other rock albums this is up there and a must have"
3,"Middling, but worth having","I wanted to love this disc, I really did. I like the U2 as much as the next guy, am quite familiar with their catalog, and thought ATYCLB was a great disc.This one, though, just doesn't have the oomph, the staying power. A year, or whatever it's been, down the line, it doesn't beckon to you to be played.On the other hand, I can't completely diss it either: it does have a handful of excellent tracks, like ""Sometimes you can't make it on your own"", ""Vertigo"" (someone give that guy a Spanish lesson, pronto), and my personal fave of the set, ""City of Blinding Lights"", the kind of haunting, gorgeous, big-chorus anthem Bono and co. excel at...."
4,not as good as old albums,Not as good as past. They still shine more than most groups. I will always buy there albums. Alot of it is the nastalgia factor. However they still make some pretty dang good music.
3,"""It's not U2, it's Duran Duran""","Three and a half stars actually. I'm a fan who will never forget ""The Joshua Tree"" and ""Achtung Baby"". These two albums, especially the first, set the bar...and ""All that you can't leave behind"" and ""...Atomic Bomb..."" will never rise to the level of that bar. It's different music for sure and it's beautiful, but lots of the fans are just haunted by the magic of the ""Joshua"" and ""Achtung"" albums. A friend of mine said about ""Atomic Bomb"": ""It's good music, but it's not U2, it's Duran Duran"". Well, it's not Duran Duran either, but I get his point. Lots of fans listen with ""Joshua"" and ""Achtung"" in the back of their minds. That's what defined U2 for them. And therefore ""Atomic Bomb"", although filled with good music, will never get five stars."
1,Listening to U2 should bring quick but painful death,"makes me want to kill myself its so bad, end of story."
2,The reason Vertigo got so much airplay early is.....,".....because the rest of the album is Norah Jones-style sleepiness. Wow, what a letdown. Vertigo rocks out; then they phone in the rest of the ""songs."" Vertigo is the only tune that is even remotely engaging. Can anyone REALLY tell when the other tunes begin and end? I can't.Oh, PLEASE don't buy the $30+ CD/DVD package. The book that is enclosed is nothing but random drawings that can't be understood and the handwriting can't be read. Now I don't even have a jewel case to store the CD in.Save your money! Borrow a copy from a friend and listen to it first!"
2,Disappointing and devoid of Soul,"I am shocked at how many people have reviewed this latest offering so well. I listened to it once and after being throroughly disappointed, listened to it again hoping it would grow on me ... well it didn't and still hasn't. Tracks 8 and 10 live up to the reviews, but the rest of this CD is IMHO completely without soul. ""Atomic"" is not even in the same ballpark as the Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. Bummer."
2,Er........this is dissapointing.,"I can't beleive this album is such a dissapointment.I never thought U2 would sink so low, how can they settle for this crap.""Vertigo"" is alright and""Sometimes You can make it on your own"" is a pretty good tune - ""All because of you"" is pretty good, but the rest, is this really the U2 album that everyones been waiting so long for?Overall the whole album has the same tone of the song ""Vertigo"" mostly and what makes this album even more outragous is that it was named by the band as ""The best U2 album ever"" well it is'nt.I was actually expecting on this record(as was said by many before it came out)that it sounds like the old U2 updated. So I was expecting a louder edgier guitar sound to it with heaps of ""mega"" tracks, and some straight forward sounding songs as well....................I just am really dissapointed........you should be to.......enough said."
3,a generous three stars,"i hope it will grow on me. so far i only like sometimes you can't make it on your own. i really hated vertigo, but i still had high hopes. u2 is one of my favorite bands and i expect a lot from them. most of these songs sound like they are ripping themselves off, and they are not even doing a good job at it."
3,Hanging on to an Edge,"With what was becoming the norm, the once vibrant group continued to fight off mediocrity mainly through an under-sung guitarist's singular sonics, and an old habit of kicking those anthemic choruses out of the park on occasion when not sleep-walking through the playbook. Give U2 credit for still not faltering in releasing albums worth owning despite their decline in quality."
1,Musically vacant,"This crap is the final stage of their gradual metamorphosis from one of the greatest and most original living bands on earth to sellout men with a deep, gargled, throaty croon that makes them sound like one of those old pros on the Vegas circuit who refuse to quit, merely altering tehir act to accommodate their gradual disintegration.So, another frustratingly inconsistent effort from one of pop's most frustratingly inconsistent artists - former great 80's and 90's band. No change there, then."
3,"Not Terrible, but not great either","This follows the typical U2 formula. 11 songs, about 6 that are upbeat, 4 that are either romantic ballads, reflective, or slower tempo, and one that is a spiritual message. It has been done before MANY times from this band. It's been done again. If you feel you need another album with this sound, pick it up. But if you have their older stuff, there is no real reason to add this one."
1,Mediocre at best,"Bad and getting worse. That's the only way I can describe U2's dwindling career, topped off by this miserable release. How does a band labelled at every turn as complete sell-out's with a dimunitive sound make a comeback in the eyes of the fans?... The answer: They attempt to re-create the once cutting edge sounds of their previous works.This album is so bad that it does not merit a worthwhle review.U2 have sold out, and they will never put anything more out worth listening to, they have betrayed their own fans, and this album shows that they got what they deserve, it's that painful to listen to.Buy any 1980-1997 U2 album instead of this mainstream band, and you will be completely satisfied, and even more so knowing that your money is not going to help already rich corporate rock sellouts."
4,"Great U2 Album, but not there Best","When U2 comes out with a new album, the anticipation and expectations are extremely high. This album did not disappoint.In October 2004, Vertigo was everywhere from ipod commercials to radio play. It was a hard rocking sound that made me so excited for the album to come out.When I bought the cd, I listened to it over, and over, and over. I am one of the biggest U2 fans out there and it takes me repeated listening to approve of their their new album.To sum it up, Original of the Species I believe is the standout track. It's probabaly one of their most beautiful songs ever recorded along with Stay, All I Want is You, and With or Without You.Other great tracks on the album are Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own, Yahweh and City of Blinding Lights. Overall a great album, but not their best. If you want U2's best album where every song just flows, then you must buy 1991's Achtung Baby."
1,doomed!,"What looks like 2004's best buy (and polled the album of the year in Russia, incidentally!) should in all honesty be thumbed down as alternative kich, at best. It sure takes a lot to pack a special edition with illustrated album under a pricy hard cover and a DVD to boot (alas, documentary and stereo). But that's all there is to the ""lot"". Edge ain't no musician and Bono no singer, the way they perform -- and they hardly ever performed better. What with painy vocal and one note chord sweeps. Ever too formal to break new ground, the band goes on riding the crest of non-existant hard core / new wave. And that fervor about society, morality and, gosh, peace! They are the Brezhnevs to the free world of rock. The hit-single tune feels borrowed (and it is!), the layout terrible, the concept phony, the title mouthful, the drawings unimaginative, the goods -- generally undelivered. And even if they were -- who cares about the bomb dismantling know-how, anyway?"
3,They are sadly aging,"I love the band U2 and would be the first to recommend any of their hits. However, I felt a lot was lacking from ""...Atomic Bomb"". The lyrics and the sound are tired and lack the innovation that U2 has been wonderful at. Though some of the songs are good (like ""Vertigo""), many of them sound too generic. If you want some great U2, check out ""War"" and ""The Joshua Tree"". This album proves that they are past their prime, still good artists, just not at the stage they once were."
1,An Absolute Disgrace,"The new millenium U2 is terrible, their worst decade. Bono and his lads had their egos take over and now U2 is washed up commercial money grubbers. This is the crappiest U2 album I've ever heard. [...]"
3,Not a big U2 fan but...,"How can ""single"" from NY say there isn't a good song on this CD? I can't believe U2 would put out such a bad CD, Vertigo is Kick Ass because of the guitar and the positive lyrics. Come on you Beotch! You must have said that because of your X. Also if you really did dislike it with one play that allways means to play it 2 more times then leave it for a couple weeks or longer and come back to it. The best albums ever made are the ones that you get into slowly, that are complicated. The ones that you love right away become boring. ROCK ON!!"
2,"OK, but not great",Two songs on this CD get air play and it's obvious why (their good!). Unfortunately the rest of the CD lacks the same fire. There is little difference between songs and Bono's off key drone makes me wonder what happened to the guy that gave us albums like Joshua Tree...
2,Weaker and Weaker,"I grew up listening to the Beatles and then in the 80's U2 was like the Beatles of the next generation. I loved Boy, War, October, Unforgettable Fire, Under a Blood Red Sky, Joshua Tree, Rattle and Hum, and Actung baby...Then comes the era of weakness. Pop had one or two good song, as did each subsequent album. The only good track is the most commercial one (Vertigo) most of the other tracks sound like throw aways, second stringers, and not something that should be on a U2 album.Don't get me wrong they are still a great band, but its starting to feel like they are running out of things to write and sing about. Maybe Bono needs to worry less about his hair and get really pissed about something like he used to and write some good music with Edge.Buy the Single (Vertigo) skip the album."
1,U2 will die for selling out so bad!,"I can't believe this. U2's albums ""War"", ""Joshua Tree"", and the epic masterpiece ""Achtung Baby"" will forever be classics in my book. That was when U2 was a GOOD band. Then they tried an experiment with Zooropa (though that art began on AB, it was a GOOD experiment) and it was that day when U2 died. Pop was no less better as well, it was even WORSE! All That You Can't Leave Behind was better then those two pieces of crap, but still not up to U2 standards. Now we have their lastest crapterpiece, How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb. They have now become money-hungry, grobbling sellouts. They make Metallica seem loyal to their fans (and trust me, that's saying something)! I will always listen to War, Joshua Tree, and Achtung Baby, as they will stand the test of time. U2 should call it a day, and break up. Sad, so sad..."
1,Don't Buy This,I won't buy anything by U2 anymore. I'm sick and tired of hearing Bono spout off about raising money for the plight of AIDS in Africa. How about the plight of AIDS right here in the USA????!!! Keep money in this country.
1,The biggest bunch of phonies in the history of rock!,"I can't stand U2. I despise them immensely. Boner (oops, I meant Bono) thinks he's so hip and righteous. I can't stand those huge glasses he wears, either. He needs to fire his stylist and quick! As for this CD, it blows. How it went multiplatinum is a mystery. ""Vertigo"" is aptly named because it made me dizzy and sick after listening to it. The album goes downhill from there. Get Madonna's ""Confessions on a Dancefloor"" instead."
1,Dissapointing,"I bought this CD expecting it to be an audio version of a manual as to how to dismantle a nuclear bomb, so we could stop world war. What a dissapointment. It was just a rock album and said nothing about getting rid of nuclear weapons. What a dissapointment."
3,Not Better Than The Real Thing,"There are four GREAT U2 albums: War, Unforgettable Fire, Joshua Tree, and Achtung Baby. Each of these is a distinct creation: recognizeably U2 but sonicly unique.Despite all the glowing reviews in the mainstream media, I don't think their latest release stands with these earlier recordings. It's a good album, with with Bono's trademark passion and the janglely guitar of the Edge, but ultimately it comes off like a lesser imitaion of their earlier work. While there are a couple inspired songs (Yahweh, Love and Peace or Else) there's nothing here of the stature of, say, any of the songs on Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby. How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb sounds like it was created more by formula than real inspiration. (I still love you, U2, and you're still the best!)"
1,Here's a thought..,"... They should have called the album How To Dismantle a Career, because it sucks ass! I can't even be bothered to look at Bono without first wanting to punch him in the face, and break those translucent sunglasses that match his lyrics. Maybe they should all pitch in a get at least one band member a full head of hair and some composition lessons. Seriously, what the hell is wrong with this band? This is worse than All That I Desperately Needed To Throw In The Trash. And to make it worse, they just keep releasing garbage, which subsequently means I have to see his ignorant image posted on more things. I realize this is more than a review. This is the end. I hate you."
1,One hit wonder,"I've appreciated U2's music for years and this album is simply disappointing. The best way for me to describe it is like a one hit wonder. It sounds like the millions of one-hit-wonder bands you hear, that create one great song just to get you to buy the CD and the rest are weak. With albums like this from great artists like U2 its no wonder the record industry has problems with pirates. It's good the CD was less than $10, but in my opinion it's not worth more than $1. U2 fans, be prepared for disappointment."
1,Bought on Sale....Still feel like I got ripped off,"Ran out and got this CD for $10 the first day it was released. Even at that bargin price, I feel that it wasn't worth the drive to the store. I see that it's breaking sales records, but I can't figure why. Being such a long time U2 fan I feel that if they can't do better than this, they should stay out of the studio and just tour on the basis of their old hits."
5,Awesome album....That's all you need to know,"Every person has the right to express his/her opinion....Here goes mine:I think HTDAAB is one of their greatest efforts....Awesome musice, great lyrics, unbelievable vibe, can't wait to hear these songs live (Although they sounded great in the Concert in Brooklyn before the record release)....It's a great listen for the casual U2 fan and for anyone who enjoys good musicThe more you listen to it, the more it grows on you"
1,Time for the truth,"Ok waiting is over, so the truth comes out. No more empty promises, no more ""best album"" words, no more marketing. Now is time for the truth. And the truth is at least 50% of fans don't like this new album, simply as that. First of all, this isn't a ROCK album at all. Only 25% ( 3 songs ) are pure Rock. The rest contains middle-tempo songs or ballads. I think U2 is an old fashioned band, I mean, they live with the smashes they had in the past. U2 is a lazy famous band now, and they know they don't have to work hard for success, and that's clear with this below average album."
3,Much of the album doesn't feel essential,"The lyrics are clear; the music is well-played, but much of the album doesn't feel essential. That's the problem with this album. It's simply another U2 album.How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is a shiny, well-polished album, but it's not an absorbing one - and given this band's long history of compelling music, that's a shame. It's the sound of a band not playing to their strengths, and taking no risks.We can't live without their brilliant statements as Joshua Tree, War, Achtung Baby or Pop, but we can live perfectly well without this one. This album is just useless. It's a minor work by a major group"
1,Manufactured Rock,"I'm in agreement with several posters who said this album is ""All That You Can't Leave Behind"" Part 2. I thought I was alone, in seeing right through that album, as nothing more than a fake, poppy, manufactured sound that was tired and dull. Well, U2 did it again, folks.You can't get much manufactured than this. It almost sounds as if the guys made this album, just to get some songs on radio, and to make some more money. There's no feeling behind any of these songs, and they're getting to be a tired, tired act.Bono is nominated for another Nobel Peace Prize. Impressive. However, I'm not impressed with the fact that it seems he also thinks that he's saving the music industry through U2's music. Fat chance. U2 is washed up, and I hope this is it. They WERE a great band, but when you start putting out forced, heartless albums such as this, time to do something else."
1,Help! Vertigo Sucks!,"U2 are overrated and boring. Why do people like this band so much? Bono sucks. I always hear this song on radios a lot, Vertigo and how it f*cking sucks. I hate that song and its very stupid. U2 SUCKS, BUY GREEN DAY, DIRE STRAITS, OR GUNS N' ROSES INSTED AND STOP LISTENING TO WHAT'S PLAYING ON STUPID RADIOS."
1,"I'm angry, disappointed and upset!!!","I have waited my whole life to finally seize the opportunity to see U2 in concert. That opportunity came and went at 11:00 this morning. Tickets sold out and my lifelong desire will now never come to pass. Because of this, I cannnot give this album a high rating because now I cannot even listen to it because of reminds me of all the trouble [...]."
1,How to dismantle an atomic bomb,"I am a dedicated U2 listener. However, I really do not understand this album. It is fairly slow paced, non-melodic, and boring. I think the first song is the only song worth listening to. If I was to use a standard, the previous album, ATYLB, was simply awesome. Each song was worth listening to over and over again.I am not sure why the other reviewers are ga-ga about this album. It is fairly weak and I really can't stand listening to each song. This is an album where you are skipping through it because few songs are worth listening to.I was disappointed with this purchase."
1,Can someone explain U2 to me,"I love music alot, but I never understand how everyone can love U2. It seems like they make a record, everyone loves it, then they disappear for awhile and repeat the process. While away, all you hear is how great U2 is and how they are one of the greatest rock bands to ever grace earth. I dont understand U2, ill admit they have good songs here and there. Why is Bono considered a music god? His music is not the greatest ive ever heard, and I dont know why it seems the world bows at there feet."
1,The Marketing scam.,"Money Money Money!!!U2 are selling this ""how dismantle an atomic pigeon"" for a fair price, add to their ""U2 Bank"" and you too could win a thing!"
1,Most overrated band of all time,"This is a three song album people. Vertigo, All Because of You, and Crumbs from your Table. The critics just continue to think this band can do no wrong. The rest is Bono whining about something. Bono seems to have writer block on some lyrics, uses ""down on knees"" in a couple songs. Do we still believe he can have the hots for a cocktail server in ""Vertigo"". Lyrics seem childish in spots ""do as I say, and no one gets hurt"" WOW very orginally stuff there. Guitar work is brillant in spots, but overall the guitar riffs are not worthy of remembering after six months of this release. I challenge you all. Will you be playing this cd in a year from now?"
1,How to Dismantle a Loyal Fan Base,"Write boring lyrics.Compose tedious tunes.Sing songs without any passion, feeling or zest.Hey Bono, ya need a good subject to write your next great song? How about the story of a fan who absolutely loved your band's music for years and then one day realized he's being taken for granted and decides to tune off?"
3,Overrated!,"It's hard to watch TV and not hear clips of ""Vertigo"". Unfortunately, that is about as good as it gets for this CD. ""Man and a Woman"" is a nice track too. However, the rest of the CD spans mediocre to just hard to listen to. ""Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own"" falls into the latter category. Listening to the chorus is like being stabbed in the head with a butter knife repeatedly.Stick to Rattle and Hum and Joshua Tree. This is a mere shadow of those classic U2 CDs."
4,Beautiful,"I am a long-time U2 fan. This is a great album with some very beautiful songs, especially Yahweh. Get past Vertigo, the least appealing song on the whole album, and you'll really love listening to it."
5,Amazing,All those pop bands should be ashamed after listen this record. They're so much better. God bless U2
2,Look what they done to my song...,"There might be good music on this disk. But something happened in between what came out of the band and what was shipped. The mix, production and mastering is so incredibly poor, the disk is physically painful to listen to - at any volume.It only got two stars out of sympathy for the musicians, whose hard work has been so thoughtlessly destroyed by people who ought to know better.I'm really bummed. It might have been good album."
3,It starts with a bang but is more like a dud,"I heard Vertigo and I thought ""great U2 is getting heavy again"". Then I got the cd! If you are expecting the rest of the record to sound like Vertigo you are going to seriously be disappointed. Straight after Vertigo the record heads into pretty tepid waters. Not to say it is necessarily bad, ""Miracle Drug"" and ""Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own"" are great songs, but after track three the record goes downhill. The remainder of the record is either mediocre (i.e. ""Crumbs from your table"") or just downright atrocious like ""Original of the Species"". Yeah this record is once again going to sell millions and give them a billion grammy's but the question is should you buy it. I don't think so. There is no point in paying $15 for a cd with three great songs and bunch of filler."
5,I'm With The Guys Who Feel This is A Great C D,"Once again, U2 has managed to produce work that has beautiful rhythm, some great lyrics, and enough heart to make you pause.There wasn't a single song that I felt inclined to ""disable"" on my Media player."
5,Just plain SOLID!!!,"This is the first review on any music CD I've ever written. I've read the critics' ""expert"" reviews and have seen this get under 2* by the Chicago Tribune to 4* by Rolling Stone. I purchased this CD today and can I am absolutely impressed. Is this a revolutionary CD? No it isn't, but it's just plain fantastic music. If you liked the Joshua Tree and - obvioulsly you did - otherwise you wouldn't be reading this review, you will absolutely love this CD. Is it as good as U2's landmark album the Joshua Tree? No, but in my view, it's their best album since that classic. If your a U2 fan, buy this album!!!"
1,Same old same old...,"Ok, its U2 with nothing else to offer. U2 has always had its own distinctive sound without straying much EVER! The redundancy is insipid, lifeless, and makes me want to never hear Bono's voice again. Edge's giutar work is also just the same old stuff. its just so pathetic to see any band wallow in the successes of the past without moving forward and offering anything new to the people. Don't buy this. you've already heard it"
1,ow!,"That guy who says this CD is like nails on a chalk board- he is right about how painfully bad this CD is.Bono-quit being so pretentious about ""good works"" you do and go back to making music like you did when I was young, ie War or Joshua Tree. Back then you were fresh. Now you are just going through the motions. Does anyone remember that old SNL skit with Mike Myers as a Japanese critic reviewing Garth Brooks? That's how it is with U2.PLEASE bring back something new that I will look forward to.signed a former fan"
3,Not the bomb but not a dud,"First off I must say I've been a U2 fan for many years though more for the ""mainstream"" hits than for entire albums. I was very hesitant about this one for the simple fact that the samples of the tracks, other than ""Vertigo"", were not very exciting.I thought they sounded very slow and melancholy and frankly, boring. ""Vertigo"" was catchy from the first listen and to my ears very typically U2.The rest of the album doesn't reach that height but after a few spins, it's not nearly as uninteresting as I initially thought.The slower songs have a beauty all their own, they pull you in.There are some faster tempo numbers with hooks that I didn't expect.I've come to like this album and perhaps to some it's far from the best U2 has ever recorded, but it's still infinitely better than many albums I've heard.Give it a chance and perhaps a second or third and see if you don't find something you like.I'll bet you will. I did."
4,"Not great, but still better than most of the junk out there","Look, I love U2. I've been a long-time fan ('since the late 80s) And I had high hopes for this album - I was looking for something new, something profound, but it just wasn't there. That doesn't mean it's not a good album, it's just not what I've come to expect from U2. It really says something about how truly good the band is when even at their worst, they are as popular as they are.I guess my complaint is that there's no underlying substance or theme to this album. There are a couple of songs that are great musically and have excellent lyrics (in particular, Love and Peace or Else) but overall, it just doesn't move me. There's no angst over losing love, no fury over aparthied, no contemplation of the ephemeral nature of life on earth -- what is this album *about*?Maybe it's just their musings while they're making something better. I hope so."
3,Grown-Up Food for Kids,"I think most of us can think of at least one food we didn't like as a kid that now we can't live without. Stop asking yourself if this is ""Ground-Breaking"" music. Instead, just listen to it, or at least play it in the background for a while. You might develope a taste for it, or not. I like what I've heard so far. (3 listens in) Some of the tracks are starting to stand out and relay some kind of human feeling. Forget the star rating I was required to give, I'm not going to give a star rating just yet. We are all still in the early childhood listening stages of this album. Oh Yeah! I almost forgot.....U2 ROCKS!"
3,"It's alright, I guess","Well, what can I say? It's not U2's best, they are still my favourite band, but this album didn't help at all with that. This is one of those albums that major fans will want to forget in the future.Vertigo is at most a mediocre song, it's fun to listen for the first 2 or so times, but then you notice that Bono can't really say ""four"" in spanish, and that kinda takes the fun away."
3,Not my fav cd but it's ok,"that's the best i could come up with - it's ok. 'all that you can't leave behind' allowed me to forgive them for 'pop'...all i can say is thank god this album didn't come out after 'pop' or i would've given up. i'm a fan of 20 years and count the early years as some of my favorites but you have to give props to a band who's willing to take risks and change...they couldn't grow up, raise families and not experience a little bit of change. the music is fantastic on every song..the lyrics are a bit boring & forced on some of the songs. with that said, htdaab is worth the money and it's not a sell out. it's a good album that may let some diehards down."
3,3 Stars for 3 Songs,"As of this review it is New Year's Day 2005 - Happy New Year's!Having been an early U2 fan, I haven't cared much for the 1990s+ bunging jumping in the abyss version of the band. Though I will credit them with improved sound - Bob Ludwig meets Mutt Lange-styled clarity.Having heard this recording, there are three songs that stand out and are true to form with this group - ""Vertigo"", ""All Because of You"", and ""Yahweh"". They are the full circle to ""October"". I think they could have worked more on the other songs. Yet, while the sound is very good, it is not the same."
2,"Uno, dos, tres, MIERDE!!!!","The world could live without this....but as mediocrity goes, it's solid!!! Going ""back to your roots"" is one thing, but pilfering from them is another. I just really hate that god damn i-pod commercial."
2,Et tu U2! Then fall your die hard fans!!,"The band that was U2You loved them and me tooThey gave us ""War"", and the ""Joshua tree""Downward they go now, falling free2 stars I give for ""Vertigo"" on itBut else this is no good dammit!From a die hard fan comes this reviewThis conclusion reached after a good previewThis thing called ""dismantle""Cannot hold a candleTo the good ol' rock of BonoWho was and will be Numero UnoBut buy not this album my friendWill not be money well spent!Wondering still where their good music wentIn earnest and well meant!PeaceSherin"
1,U2 seems to be a good memory of our youth,"what did have to happen to U2 for they could make a so deficient and lack of honesty album? what happened with those 4 young man from Dublin who reached directly at our hearts and minds, with 3 chords and the truth? all that illusion, all that magic, all that youth, all that energy, and those hymns are had lost, television has been turned off and the white flags have been put out. It gives so much pain, really, because I'm a die hard fan, and I really believed in they were going to release their bestalbum, but that hasn't happened. I don't know how to do now, ifreturn waiting, or better to begin to listen to another more honest and new music. Despite with Pop they sent acid critics towards that supermarketing world a while ago, they have settled down in that world of the commercialization nowadays. I feel so bad, U2."
1,"This is not an album, is just a collection of 11 songs","If you are honest with yourself, don't pretend to be nice with U2 by saying beautiful words for this soup while you actually knows it sucks"
2,"Pretentious title; This should be titled ""Pop""","This is the CD that U2 should have titled ""POP"". This is basically middle of the road, white bread pop. The multitudes love this type of music.This title, ""How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb"" is pretentious and out of place for this album. With a title like that, I really expected U2 to have something to say, similar to albums like ""War"", ""Unforgettable Fire"" or ""Joshua Tree"". With a title like that, I expected to be challenged. Instead, we get sappy love songs, or emotional outcryings from Bono.I applaud groups experimenting, and changing. We don't need another ""Unforgettable Fire"". But, this album does not experiment or push the boundaries. This is just a continuation of ""All That You Can't Leave Behind"". And that CD was just U2 conforming to the general music style of 2001."
2,underwhelmed,"Not one of U2's best efforts. As a matter of fact, i can only think of three tunes on this CD that are memorable. Soon to be gathering dust on a shelf. Buy All That You Can't Leave Behind or Joshua Tree or one of U2's many other good CDs, and take a pass on this one."
3,Not A Classic,"I am a big U2 fan so I usually love everything that they do. However, this album never quite made it for me. It's not a terrible piece of work, they just could have done better. There are some really good songs on this CD but most of it just seems like fluff. I know that they can't always be perfect and deep, but I expected better than this."
1,Skip this packaging,"I'm giving this whole ""Limited Edition"" package a one star rating, not the album alone. I'd like to consider myself a die-hard U2 fan but I honestly felt ripped off when I gave over this much money for nothing. The book included is ... Amazon wouldn't approve of the word I want to use so I'll just say useless. You can live without the DVD, it's nothing special. If you want How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, buy the single (cheaper) CD."
3,"not the best, not the worst","""uneven"" would be the way to describe this album for me. i think this album has some inspired moments on it, as well as some insipid moments, at times even within the same song - re:""Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own"".this album probably won't make a lot of new fans. but if you're not familiar with U2 by this point, then i don't know where you've been living.i'm a pretty big U2 fan, i think ""All That You Leave Behind"" was a really great album. this album was okay, but kinda leaves you wanting a little more."
2,I just wish they sounded more like an atomic bomb,"Dont get me wrong this band is still in good shape, but there's just something missing here. None of the songs really grab my attention, they sound bored. I have to admit my fave U2 albums are achtung, zooropa and Pop, there's the U2 I fell for, so i was probably wrong looking for more of it on their latest albums. Still better than most of this years' releases. 2.5 starsCheers, JM"
1,disappointing after a long wait,"After U2's last stellar effort, I was expecting more from one of the world's last great rock and roll bands. I have and still throughly enjoy the bands previous efforts but was very disappointed after multiple listenings to this album. I am sure Bono, The Edge, Adam and Larry still have a lot to say, but they did not do it on this album. My advice to U2 fans - if you do not have previous U2 album's - spend your money there not on this effort. Hopefully the band's next collection of material will be back to their previous standard."
1,corporations = not good,"U2 has become a corporation and is therefore no good. I just got a new CD player and my friend thought he would get me some CDs I would like. This was included, but I didn't like it. I like music with weird sounds in it and this isn't it. It's just basic, formulaic corporate crap the majors force-feed us. I tried to sell the CD back to a used store but they already had too many copies."
1,"some people pretend to like it just because it's ""U2""","Finally the truth comes out, isn't it Bono ?Please stop pretending this album is fantastic, because it's clear it isn't.Silly instant soup for silly teenagers."
1,Just Bad Music,"Its not that its inappropriate, its that it sucks. Vertigo is not that good, and the rest of the songs on the cd are crap. Buy their older cds if you want their good songs, but if you just want to be ""cool"" buy this cd, but be warned, after about three weeks, it gets annoying. Mine did. I almost bought a u2ipod, but thank goodness i didnt. What a waste that would have been."
3,Not their best and very hype up and overated.,"U2 can do alot better than this, their are good songs on here ""Vertigo"" ""Sometimes You can't make it on your own"" ""Miracle Drug"" ""All Because of You"" ""Yahweh"" but the rest.....er I don't know if you could count the rest as being classic outstanding U2 songs.Their are even a few that are irritating like ""Man and a Woman"" which is just a really stupid stupid song and ""City of Blinding lights"" which sounds alright at the start but has a desiribleyforgettable chorus ""Oh you look so beautiful tonight.....In the city of blinding lights"" now I don't know about you but to me that just sounds stupid and not much of a chorus.As for the album as a whole, its pretty good but far from outstanding, they could of done alot better.""POP"" is their best album - musically its very impressive and just brilliant (particularly the guitars) its a completley new sound of U2 and it sounds great right from the start to the end."
1,All that U2 can't leave behind,"All that u2 can't leave behind: the tours, the adulation ... the money? What other reason is there for making music like this? There is no inspiration here (except for Vertigo, which is a sort of tribute piece to their own earlier music). The band sounds like it's swimming in a vat of liquid Zoloft. Rock music is a young man's game, there is nothing wrong with LEAVING IT BEHIND and preserving one's dignity. As it is, they are like a civil servant putting in his 30 years to maximize his pension, but with all their money they don't even have that excuse."
2,They phoned it in.....,"The fact that there are so many mixed reviews of this album says it all. This is ""supposed"" to be the U2 that returns to it's rock roots. Rather, it's just a another bland over-produced mediocre output that they've become so proficient at making over the last decade plus. Most of the songs sound as if any average band could put them out. This is the great U2??Sure, there are a few songs that will hold you for a little while. But, compared to U2 in their hay-day these songs are merely ""fillers"". Clearly, U2 ran out of ideas and energy a long time ago (See their last 3-4 albums for evidence).It's sad, when you really think about it. They're living off their past and a HUGE marketing budget. That's it. Btw, I really really wanted to like this album. But, like the last few, it just wasn't feasible to do so if you have a frame of reference for what this band ""used to"" be. Sad...."
2,A WEAK ALBUM,"A weak album. Bono's voice is on leave in order to keep smoking.It would have been if HTDAAB were included Fast Cars and Mercy, rather One Step Closer and Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own.U2 dare not try a new experimental music way, that's clear here.I really want they to stop all these safe albums.U2 can sleep for 4 years, re-make some ATYCLB outtakes and release that stuff as ""the best U2 album"" because of deaf and blind fans.This weak album is a deception, indeed. They disgrace their career with these ""albums"" ( talking about ATYCLB and this one ). Now I know why this album is known as ATYCLB II, literally. This crude delivery will pay Bono's drinks and smokes, and some kids will be happy for that..."
3,It's all about the name...,"Yes, this album is average. Yes, it's no big deal. But there's aplus to it: it comes with the name ""U2"" on it. And that's a quality certificate.Bands that last so long have usually some great skill, and U2 has a LOT of skills. This new album is nothing fantastic, but it's like security blanket for U@ fans: it clearly shows the band is still capable of recording grat stuff without selling out."
1,What's wrong with Pop Bono ?,"hey Bono, what's wrong with Pop ?why did you leave all creativity and vanguard after Pop ?what the hell is so wrong with Pop ???It was an excellent and essential record, but now in this new century u2 is a band that lives because of the past, without ideas, nor inspiration, nor innovation, neither surprises, etc. This disc is a nastinessPlease remember fans are not lambs !!!"
3,It grows on you,"I remember when I first heard Achtung Baby...I neither liked it nor disliked it. However, after listening to it a few times, it began to grow on me. Now it is my favorite U2 CD along with The Unforgettable Fire and Joshua Tree. How to Dismantle the Atomic Bomb feels the same. I neither like nor dislike it, but a few songs are really starting to grow on me. Listening to Miracle Drug and City of Blinding lights, I am starting to hear the classic melodies of U2 past. Hopefully the more I listen to it, the more it will really get under my skin. Its starting to...thats a good sign."
2,The whole thing is meh...,"I don't understand how anyone could say that this latest effort by U2 is energetic! I hate to have to say it, but I'm very disappointed. The songs are slow, Bono's voice sounds strained on several tracks, the lyrics are so-so and the music lacking. It's a real letdown to be sure!"
2,I was disappointed,"After the disappointment of ""All That You Can't Leave Behind"" I was hoping U2 might get it back together and release a better album. But HTDAAB is even worse...I just can't believe that the band that released such masterpieces as ""the Joshua Tree"", ""The Unforgettable Fire"" or ""Achtung Baby"" released this.. How very disappointing""City of Blinding Lights"" is probably the only half decent song on the album and that's pushing it.. I guess it would be an average album if it wasn't U2.. But in U2 standards it's very lacking. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because it is U2."
2,Did Celine Dion write the lyrics?,"My first concert ever was U2 during the Unforgettable Fire tour and I've bought all their music. Unfortunatley, ""How to..."" rates as one of their more inconistent efforts. The uptempo numbers-Vertigo, Crumbs, All Because of You, City of Blinding Light--are pretty good. Musically, some of the tracks sound too similar and the slow numbers are just unbearable. Are they out of ideas? Lyrically, this has to be their worst showing. Some of the words literally make me wince.....""her face matched her psychology."" What does that mean? Maybe their next release (which will be in 2010 or so) can raise the bar again."
1,Not very informative...,"Its unfortuante, but this is not the instructional CD that I mistook it for. It contains very little information pertaining to A-bombs."
1,"it juz a ""ok"" album","Although i'm a big fan of U2 but i think this album was not great as well. You should not believe those who give 5-stars or 4-stars reviews because some of the song in this album was so terrible and the lyrics was not meaningful. If you don't like the 1st singles from this album ""vertigo"", you should not buy it because all the song are the same. I think this is juz a ""ok"" album for me."
5,My Generation,"Elvis, The Beatles, The Stones and U2 who are the last of the ""OLD SCHOOL"" traditional style of Rock and Roll artists / bands that have been able to survive / progress into this century. I'll take a moment to say that Rock is not dead. This CD will stand the test of time."
4,Fast Cars -- worth the money?,"The only reason I can think of for buying this CD is the extra song, ""Fast Cars,"" which is not on the American release. It's a great song, too. I'm not that big a fan of the album itself; there are several great songs, but also a few lackluster songs, so it's a bit of a mixed bag. ""Fast Cars"" is a standout, though, AND it's the song from which the album draws its title. I'd suggest buying the AMerican release, and then going to iTunes and buying the less-than-a-dollar ""Fast Cars."" Then you can make your very own version of this import, and have spent considerably less.Great song, though, no doubt about that."
1,Palliative care needed,"Can somebody please stop these 4 pathetic has-beens from making any more noise. It's way over the edge of tolerance (no pun intended). Leave the path for new talent. You guys had your moment, it wasn't all that bad, but please keep your self dignity and avoid becoming the laughing stock of rock just for the sake of some more $ - in spite of all Mr. Vox's conscience itchings."
1,Not The U2 Music You Love,These men have made some great albums. This is not one of them.It has no substance. It is a total waste of time/money.If your money comes hard skip this one.It is so sad. This could have been a great collection.
1,How to dismantle this year's worst CD,It's hard to explain how bad this CD. After the first 2 songs this disc takes a nose dive like no other.How a band with so much talent can turn out such a piece of crap is beyond me. Pull out the Joshua Tree and relive the good old days.
1,Complete disappointment,"The album to me is a commercial friendly flop. The music at one time meant something, now it seems the band is simply out to continue making money and using the U2 name and there songs to benefit charity and other things which is very good. But what happened to the dedication and focus on the music? ""lets just sound like Joshua Tree and just make some generic songs..""I don't know where the band is headed but this album is boring.Not too many good things here. A few tracks are memorable, the opening track gets annoying after a few listens and then the CD gets put on the shelf or in the discount bins.Do yourself a favor and look for U2's other albums. Even U2's POP album has a little more to offer than this."
1,Why Does U2 Get Such Critical Acclaim?,"I don't understand why so many music critics continue to lavish praise on U2. I don't hear anything new or exciting on ""How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb"". It's tired,overdone,boring,bland,and pompous. I don't like one song on it. ""Vertigo"" sounds horrible to me,but it's the best they have to offer. ""Yahweh"" is one of the worst songs they've ever done. All the songs in between just put me to sleep. The best thing about trying to listen to the album is that it cures my insomnia.Bono said he'd know it was time for U2 to hang it up when they did two bad albums in a row. He's lucky ""All That You Can't Leave Behind"" was a decent album or U2'd have to retire now. Actually,""Pop"",""Zooropa"",and ""Bomb"" have all been bad.I'm not going to listen to the hype any more. The critics who call every new U2 album the best one in years are always wrong. They've said it about every album since ""Boy"" and they've been wrong every time."
2,"U2 Was once my life blood , nomore","I believe that u2 was one of the greatest rock bands of our time, not because they were Irish clovers but because they displayed true talent, and Bono's voice is very spirited and will always be however this album sucks. I enjoy old U2, when they first hit the fast paced mainstream universe they were very different and I liked what I heard. Now all I hear is this 'Vertigo' stuff and I think Bono has become like all the other pop stars in this world, money tree people! Maybe the next U2 album will be better than this one, how to dismantle an atomic waste of your money."
2,All That Shmaltz They Can't Leave Behind,"First of all, I'm a fan of U2; have been since I was a teenager: loved War and Unforgettable Fire. Grew up while watching their style evolve: loved Achtung and Zooropa (and elements of Pop). Was bored by All That You Can't Leave Behind. So, I had high expectations that HTDAAB was going to be a great album. Boy was I disappointed. Vertigo was a real tease that this album was going to be earth-shattering and upbeat. While I found the lyrics on HTDAAB to be stronger than in the recent past, I found the music dull and monotonous. I guess I should have seen this coming: they look bored in the video for Vertigo and the iPod commercial would have made a better video!"
1,It happend to U2? Me too,This album is garbage period. I read a review of someone saying that this is U2's best album. is that a joke or what? I would recommend you Skipping this overrated garbage and buy their only 2 good albums. The Joshua Tree and achtung baby.
1,Nowhere near their roots,"11 unconnected pop songs. Simply a filler stuff for the bucks. U2 are playing it safe once again. They are over-the-hill as they aren't ambitious or take creative risks. Bono botched his singing melodies so badly. I don't know how the hell he likes his own voice. Maybe he's deaf.This album is just boring and painful, plain and simple. Not only is this the worst piece of corporate radio fodder garbage album that U2 has put out, but it is now in my top 20 'worst albums I've ever heard.' This album has absolutely nothing to offer.... unless you like to music that sounds like it was made in a church by a bunch of 45 year old half-asleep drunks.on another note, dont bother pretending to like this album just so you can be 'loyal' to the band."
1,Why U2 decide to make yet another album?,"What has happened to this band? A years ago ( until 90's ) they were doubtlessly the best contemporary rock band and then suddenly they've became a sellout corporation. Bono's voice is getting worse all the time, as well songwriting. Songs are miserable and lame, monotonous and annoying. Sterile production makes this album even worse. That production is very one-sided, with every song designed as a simple, catchy, mid-tempo rocker or ballad. Rotten simplistic crap as ATYCLB. As marketable as that previous soup.This is essentially only a dull plodder, forgettable filler. A sea of mediocrity. Here we have U2 making a bunch of songs sound like trademarked U2. Plus, the vocal assault doesn't help take away the impression of U2 becoming dumbed down cartoon caricatures of themselves.Achtung Baby and Pop now seemed a million miles away"
3,Middle of the Road,"This album has been reviewed as both excellent and terrible. It is neither. It is an average, middling album that is only really horrible in the sense that it is the product of a band that should be able to do better. In the same stroke, it is only truly fantastic if you are such a die-hard U2 fan that you don't really care anymore what the music sounds like.Vertigo, the opening track, has power but lacks the poignant message of the really great U2 songs(Sunday Bloody Sunday, etc.). I enjoyed Miracle Drug, but City of Blinding Lights was about enough to make me quit listening. The final track, Yahweh, wasn't bad, but I had expected something more of the closing - something that really left me with the impression of an excellent album.Overall, this album is worth having if you can find it for less than twelve dollars or if you really have to own every U2 album."
2,What is this exactly?,"Like the other 1900 people here, i'm a huge fan going way back to the -nevermind. The last itme we waited four years for an album we got Achtung Baby. The time before that we got The Unforgettable Fire. Both stellar albums. This time though, I think this is my least favorite (after POP) lyric album but one of the best U2 albums musically.Love and Peace certainly gets one's attention. The Edge's guitarand Adams heavy bass make it radically different from everything else on the album. Now that I think about it the guitar is theonly truly interesting part of the entire album. The melodies drone into one another and well, with unconnected imagery and a lack of poetic center it just throws me off. Not their best work,but not the worst either."
1,"Wow, what happened????","I am an avid U2 collector of many years, and this album is a huge dissapointment. It looks like U2 is done pushing the envelope of the mainstream and taking us with them. You will not be inspired, suprised, interested, or moved by this album at all. I sure hope they make a lot of money so that they can come back with one of those less popular and much more interesting albums. They really need to decide if they are going to be a relevant band, or produce more retarded videos like the ""Stuck in the Moment"" one with the same director as Britney Spears. They should be confident enough to keep progressing like bands such as Radiohead. Sorry guys, but this will sound great on one of those poppy radio stations, but will never be worth a crap in my car. Maybe they should decide whether they want musical appreciative fans of mindless followers. Just my humble opinion."
2,Fading but still competent,These lads clearly have seen better days. I believe they still have enough left to justify their existence but unfortunately Achtung Baby is a ghost while listening to this long player. Like Sachin Tendulkar at the crease these musicians still induce awe but could anyone honestly describe them as the band in the world on the basis of this long player?
2,"Average, cookie-cutter, by-the-numbers","U2 hasn't ROCKED since POP. This effort is overproduced, and under-written. Bono's lyrics are getting worse as he continues to spend more time away from the band. The rhythm section here is pedestrian at best, and Edge is just recycling like never before.I'm a HUGE fan, dating back to when I first saw them in January 1981, but this is weak. POP had it all, great drums and bass, lyrics and Edge experimenting and creating rather than recycling. It's a true work of art right up there Joshua Tree and Actung Baby. This is just sub-par."
2,Mediocre U2 album (2.5 stars),"This album was very much a let down. You would come to expect something more fresh and inspiring after a 4 year absense from U2. No surprises here unlike their previous albums. Very straight forward music.Better luck next time U2, but it seems time's running out."
2,Dissapointing ...,"Oh okay , Im U2 fan and a fan of music as well . Its not easy being a fan of todays music industry! U2 no doubt is a fantastic band , and even on this album Adam, The edge and Larry have displayed their legendary talents with the guitar, drums and Bass. However, I have to say that I feel they're pretty much are stuck in a league of their own, which isnt appealing anymore. Music is part rythm, part lyric , part melody and part harmony (& about chord progressions etc) . It would be nice to see them not play it ""safe"" for a change , just like former Savage Gardens Frontman Darren Hayes latest solo Album "" The Tension & the Spark"" that speaks volumes about being musically evolved ( think Eurythmics), a far better musical triumph Ive so thoroughly enjoyed although it will not sell truckloads like U2 . Why ? hmm ... I have to say with regret that U2 as a brand have become larger than the music!"
1,"If U2 is the best band in the world, bring on the Polka!!!","U2 has been my favorite band for about the past 10 years. Achtung Baby is still my favorite album, and I couldn't wait until HTDAAB was released so U2 could dominate the music world once more. Much to my disappointment, U2 should throw in the towel. Every album is released with words such as ""U2 have reinvented themselves and the Edge has rediscovered the guitar."" The guitar is sad, the songs drag on, and Bono's voice and lyrics have fallen from greatness. This album is so boring, it doesn't sound like U2 even care about making music anymore. They just need a lot of overly-dedicated fans to give them too much money and inflate thier already enormous egos."
3,Hardly an explosive album,"""How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb"" is one of those albums that, aside from the popular songs, really doesn't have that much to offer. If the whole album were filled with songs like ""Vertigo"" and ""All Because of You"", it would be a classic. Unfortunately, many of the songs lack the heart and soul as once heard in such albums as ""Achtung Baby"" and ""Zooropa"". Lyrically, it has many more spiritual references, which is good; however, musically, it's really bland."
