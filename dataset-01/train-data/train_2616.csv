5,Best version I've read,"Unlike other translations I've read, this version doesn't seem stilted or precious. It's clear, digestible while preserving poetic grace and style. The introduction is well worth reading before you get to the guts of the book. I keep buying copies because I seem to give this one away a lot."
2,Slighty dissapointed,"While the program is as described, I had a Win. 98 Crossword software that was easier to use. For example, type a list of words and it would auto fill a blank puzzle, and then I could type the clues. I am hoping that it will get easier to do with experience."
1,Hahhah's Hunks is Horrible,"First, you have to believe a diabetic can NEVER eat any sugar. At least, that's the premise of this novel. A little research should have showed Ms. Tucker that this is wrong.Secondly, you have to believe in a hero so stupid that he believes Hannah hands out cards that advertise she is a woman of ill repute who rents out her ""hunks"".Then you have to watch this heroine waver between different personalities, only one of which is entertaining.Save your money."
2,not a good sorce for vitoria vetri,if you are looking for good pics of victoria vetri then buy the may 1968 issue of playboy and not this one their just isnt enought shots of her to make it worth buying in my opinion I have this issue and the may issue and you would much rather have the may issue featuring her as playmate of the year than this issue which only has her in a couple of shots even thought she is the center fold in this issue.
1,Fried my ipod!,"My charger came from Accessory Export, LLC Storefront. It looked slightly different than the one in the picture, but I didn't think anything of it. The second I plugged it into my ipod, the screen went nuts. My ipod is now totally non-functional. After this happened, I checked the output voltage on the unit and it read 12V. I wish I had looked at that before plugging it in. Some ipod chargers run at 9 volts. Apple's charger puts out a whopping 5 volts. But 12 volts is just way too much juice. Needless to say, I am not very happy with Accessory Exports. If you buy this unit, make sure it looks like the one in the picture, and for goodness sake, check the output voltage before hooking it up to your ipod!"
3,50% batting average,"I was looking for a cheepo Ipod USB car adapter...and that just what I found. It is cheap in price, even in construction. But what's the difference? It just works. Label say 12V input, 5V output. It has a red LED on the side that tells you it is plugged. It is made in China.My old 30G Ipod's battery is now loosing its charge faster as it is getting old. Now, I just hook it up on this thing and no worries that it will stop in the middle of my long drive. It plays while charging at the same time.I prefer the USB than the wider iPod cable because, more often the wide cable adapter gets broken by an ipod firmware update; not the USB.Update:I ordered a second one. This one does not work except for the red LED."
1,crappy,"i bought this obviously to charge my phone in the car. and it didn't even work. the light came on, but it wouldn't charge my phone"
2,break quickly,It worked well at the first but then broke quickly after several uses. It is better spend a little more on something more sturdy.
1,They didn't work fir me,These did not work on my I-phone 4. The phone shows the elect symbol in the top corner when plugged in but a caution message comes up saying that this machine does not support this device. The price would be great if they worked I would like to get my money backWhite Universal 12 Volt USB Car Charger for Apple iPod or USB Charging Device
5,"WOW, Media exposes the corruption of Justice","Although the publisher really messed up the format of this book, the document section begins with a bang and finishes with an explosion. The author's comments expose what the documents show, a joining at the hips of the executive and judicial branches of government. The separation of the multitude of issues in the Bryant case makes each issue easy to follow to its conclusion and shows why the TV NEWS CORPS hung their tails when the truth was exposed to the public; a good ole boy system and public prosecution. A great read for justice."
5,Making music is fun!,"I bought this book when I was looking for directions on how to avoid RSI, after a week of struggling with pain on my right arm. To some extent, I got what I was looking for, but to my surprise I got A LOT more. In this book I got new ideas on how to make my practice routine (wich is a everyday thing for me, as a music student and professional musician) into an exciting event on my life. This book is totally worth it!"
2,Not inspiring,"I selected this book bc I thought it would hold good tools to fall back on during piano practice ... it was less than inspiring, somewhat outdated and general. Was disappointed and would not recommend it .."
3,"OK, Not Great","""Fear is energy. If you allow it to flow through you, you transform it into fearlessness."" Do those sentences concerning stage fright mean anything to you? Do you think that they will help you become a better musician? If so, this book gets four stars as far as you are concerned.If you think that those sentences have meaning only if you already know what the author is saying, then this book gets two stars.Not all of the book is made up of the type of touchy-feely advice above. There are more practical tips, and interesting anecdotes.You'll probably get something out of this, especially if you are a practice-a-holic like me, but don't expect it to take your playing to a whole new level."
2,Didn't serve my needs,"It is conceivable that some might find this book inspiring or useful, I was disappointed to find new insights fairly sparse. If you already recognize the importance of becoming spiritually and physically connected to your instrument, then this book will not be very satisfying. It is largely one person's experience (the author's) and the extent to which this might be useful to others is, well, variable. I can only remember two things about the book despite having re-read certain sections several times in search of possibly missed revealations: 1. too much time was devoted to relaxation exercises, and 2. the interesting brief anecdote about Rachmaninoff practicing. The latter item helped me envision what I would view as a more useful book: one that surveys the practicing approaches/methods used by a wide variety of effective musicians. This sort of book would give the reader a wide array of tried and true practicing approaches to experiment with."
3,"OK, but find a teacher...","I had great hopes for this book. There are only a few publications that touch on the topic of recovery from injury for the pianist. This one does. The actuall meat and potatoes of the technique at the piano is not explained well. The author does a great job of physical/mental/spiritual preparation before practice. There IS a lot of good info, but if you are looking for practice techniques at the piano for previous wrist pain or other hand issues you will be disappointed. There is a lack of detail on her specific exercises."
2,"Great contents, bad reading:","Chock full of great stuff, but much too wordy and repetitive. The anecdotes never end. In addition, one or two suggestions are outrageous. Too bad, with so many sound ideas and well needed ergonomic advice!"
2,chicken soup for the musician looking for a short cut,"Barry Green said it first and said it best in the ""Inner Game of Music""."
5,Exceptional,"Awesome work Alan. I have read all of your books and thanks to your knowledge and expertise, my consulting business is now a million dollar business. Gloria Starr"
5,Perfect Companion to Million Dollar Consulting,"This book provides templates, checklists, forms and examples for implementing the ideas, techniques and strategies from the highly successful ""Million Dollar Consulting"". Guranteed to save you loads of time and enable you hit the ground running every time."
5,Exceeded my expectations,"I got this machine as gift and I love it!! I have saved tons of money that would have gone to Starbucks since I started using this.The cord is NOT short - it can be adjusted if you just turn the machine over and unravel the cord. It's actually quite smartly designed so you don't have oodles of cord all over your countertop.I can make a latte in this thing in under 5 minutes. The frothing arm gets ""warmed up"" as the espresso is brewing (I think another reviewer may be doing it wrong if it takes him over 10 minutes). Just turn the dial to 'off' after the desired amount of coffee has dripped in. Then have your frothing pitcher/mug of milk handy and turn the dial to 'steam'. The frothing aid is great and helps to make very creamy froth (skim milk really does make the best froth).Anyways, this thing is awesome I think I would have been happy even if I had spent $50 on it (my husband got it for $25 at Target). Very great deal!!!"
4,Good for a tight budget,"This is a rather good machine considering the price. I'm on my second Mr. Coffee espresso machine in a year, but keep in mind that I make anywhere from one cappucino to three a day. Amazingly enough, it actually produces a decent crema. I honestly didn't expect any. Now, I do realize the espresso is not the best... but I have found it to be great with some good, freshly ground beans... filtered water.... to make cappucinos or lattes. Speaking of which, it froths nicely. Also, I read in another review that you should shop around... and she was right... especially in regards to the price at Walmart. I should note that I have tried what is considered to be mid-priced espresso machines... like Krups.. and found this silly Mr. Coffee to be of better quality and to produce better quality espresso. So I suggest that you either go with this... or look into spending upwards of $1000. All those in between seem to be pure junk."
1,"Short cord, poorly functioning frothing action","Think that size doesn't matter? Then try plugging in this device without the use of an extension cord! It's ridiculously short, which hinders placement considerably. The espresso turned out fine; however, the frothing aid was absolutely nonfunctional. Or so I thought ... a later attempt revealed that the steam may not begin pumping for up to 30 seconds. The time to steam milk is pathetic, up to 3 minutes for fairly warm at best. Total time for a cup with this machine: About ten minutes, including brewing and frothing. Just sad."
1,Works Fine...For a Few Months,Bought one of these last Christmas. Used it about 3-4 times per week at work. Fairly decent cup of espresso considering the price of the machine. After about 4 months it quit working properly and would just sit there and get real hot and give off steam but not brew the espresso. I figure I just had a bad machine so I bought an identical one. It worked about 5-6 months and did exactly as the first one. The quality of the capucinno was fine but the machine is cheap and doesn't last. I'm not buying a 3rd. I would've been better off to buy an expensive one to start with.
2,Steam escapes,I bought this machine new from a major store. I had it 3 months when most of the steam started leaking out of the filter basket area. I now have to add a lot of water for it to make very little espresso. I loved it up to then though. I'll see if I can fix the problem before trashing it.
4,Good Moka Maker,"I bought this at Wal Mart for a little less than $30. I didn't want to buy a stovetop moka pot because they're made of aluminum. Also, my Wife would complain till the end of time that I'm too cheap to buy an electric espresso maker for her. Not that she'll ever end up using it anyway. As far as I understand this unit makes moka via steam pressure, not espresso which uses pump pressure and cooler water. I think this is also called Cafe Cubano. It really doesn't produce crema. For what it does, its fine and I'm glad I went electric instead of stovetop. I tried the steamer, and it works, but I don't drink coffee with milk. All and all its an interesting change of pace from drip coffee. Hopefully I'll get some good years of use out of it. Right now I'm using pre-roasted Nicaraguan coffee that I grind as needed. After that's gone, I'm going back to home roasting, so that's when I'll really get to pursue the perfect cup of coffee."
4,excellent value but user manual could be improved,"We use it for cappucinos. excellent value, great taste.my tips for cappucino: (mistakes in the manual).1) use 1 heaped tablespoon per cup (ignore the manual).2) tamp down the coffee using the flat bottom of a 1/4 cup measure - it fits snugly in. Do NOT use the back of the spoon they provide as it tamps and unevenly causing uneven dripping.3) fill carafe with water to the top of the metal band for 2 cups.4) Don't bother to use the steam spout - simply add milk to your cup and microwave it.5) before you use it, fill the carafe with water and empty it in a cup to measure its volume. When the carafe breaks, you will have a backup."
4,Great but READ THIS:,"This thing makes great espresso BUT...wash it out many times before use. It took over ten vigorous rinsings of the pressure vessel to remove all of the METAL flakes and debris. Most everyone would do so of course but...some folks I know do quick rinse and press on...WRONG. Wash it good and then run it a few times with water only (no coffee)as well, then make coffee. Otherwise, no complaints. Works great and the price is right. Has a better switch (a weak point in all these makers) than our last $180 unit that failed after just a few months. Use filtered water in this maker and quit spending $$ every week at the coffee stand!"
1,Died an early death,"The machine worked well enough in the beginning. It was purchased in July 2007. By early December 2007, it was leaking out of the area where the filter basket is supposed to seal to the machine. With it properly filled, it now only produced about 4 fl.oz of espresso and the rest of the water passed by as steam. Shame really."
4,"Excellent, funny story","In this story, the excellent M. F. K. Fisher, better known for her gastronomical writing, tells the story of two American little girls, Anne and Mary, and their mother as they adapt to living in France. They gradually make the acquaintance of a mongrel dog, who manages to keep tabs on the entire town. Told as a series of vignettes, this semi-autobiographical story is charming and funny, if slightly lacking in continuity. A pleasure to read."
2,Dances with Fools,"Unfortunately, Kevin could never distinguish any truth between his love for a movie and that of his love of himself. The films never were about anything but, you guessed it, Kevin. It is sad...a little less self absorption...a little more talent....who knows...maybe a film that would actually recover some production costs."
4,Good children's book,"It is too bad that this book seems to be out of print. My daughter just loves it. I had checked it out from the library and had to buy my own copy. It goes through the town and talks about everyone who is asleep and then tells the child it is time to be asleep also. All with delightful pictures showing what the people, such as baker, librarian, teacher, zookeeper, do. For a child like mine who fights sleep to the best of her ability this is a great book!"
5,I like this CD alot.,"I just got it last week, but have listened to it almost everyday since. It has a nice mix of straight ahead tunes, beautiful acoustic ballads and some more edgy stuff that really rocks. Definitely worth getting if you like jazz."
4,Bucky Take Note,"Fans of the new jazz will enjoy this CD. The playing by all instrumentalists is vibrant, moving and captivating. The original compositions and rendering by Ben Rodefer remind me of an early Bucky Pizzarelli.I am not a big fan of fusion jazz; but this is not quite that and is exceptional for listening and grooving."
1,Best Unknown Jazz Guitarist Who Should Remain Unknown,"""Best Unknown Jazz Guitarist Who Should Remain Unknown"" - a waste of good sideman on this one."
1,definately not one of her best,"I read and loved Acorna and eagerly picked up the second book in the series and what happened? This grand search for her people fizzles and they just turn up, right on the doorstep of a planet where people know her. What a happy coincedence that out of all the planets in space, they just find the planet where Acorna had been living. I was expecting a nice quest to find her people and what did I get, plot devices and some daft sub-plot about these space faring criminals, I cared so little about their story and that Tirla-lite character, that I skipped vast sections of the book and gave up. Terrible, proof that McCaffrey has truly lost the plot.. Do not read."
3,Nice touch -needs just a little more,"It was so hard to start it. I even set it down for like a mouth, but if you past the first 90 such pages it gets really interesting. It's definetly long enough and that's fine, but the story will be really good and then really boring and then realy good exc.., but I'm still looking forward to Acronas people. One last thing is that it left me with a different feeling. In Acrona it left the ending open. There were so many possibilets. At the end of this one it ended the story-it could stop and never go on again because I know what her future. I loved the cover and the book over all though."
3,Light and fun,"This Acorna story is not as good as the first, but it is entertaining and fun. I would certainly not recommend fans to avoid it (especially younger readers), but I found the subplot to be tedious. The story switches between Acorna's story and a secondary story, chapter by chapter.(I actually didn't read much of the subplot - I found it so dull that I skipped those chapters and rather enjoyed the rest of the story! I'm giving this book 3 stars because I understood the Acorna story while only reading every other chapter.)"
5,Great books!,"I have read these books many times over the years, and will probably read them again in the not too distant future. Sci-fi but with plenty of fantasy thrown in to make it engaging for fantasy buffs like myself."
2,A slightly below average tale,"I will try not to give out spoilers.The characterization of Acornia's Quest improves from the first installment of this series, yet the language and dialogue feels forced. Interactions between characters don't seem to flow normally but lurch from line to line. Spontaneous reactions to certain events feel predetermined and faked. I can feel the weight of the author throughout the story thus, preventing me from truly falling into the spell of the words. This weight can be felt in the odd dialogue turns, the odd reasoning, and in certain resolution scenes at the end of the book."
4,the foresters daughter,It was a good read but it needed more drama. I like the era and how it was written but it just needed a little more infor
1,let down,"I thought this book looked fun and colorful. My daughter doesn't share my opinion. The illustrations are fun but the text is horrible, nearly non-existent. The words are too small and it sits on the shelf. There are a ton of wonderful stories filled with amazing illustrations. Why waste money on this one?"
2,"Great concept, poor design","I like the idea of having a case that can stay on my belt when I need to use the phone. The phone snaps easily in and out is this holster. The problem is that the clip on this product is designed in such a way that it digs into your body constantly when secured to your belt/waist. The only comfortable place to attach it is to my pocket, but this isn't very secure. It isn't a total waste of money, I still clip it to various articles of clothing... just not my belt."
4,A really fun board!,"I,ve been playing darts for a long time, and this is the funnest board I have ever played on. Both steel and plastic tips stick fairly well, and the trash talking is great.There are 2 things of interest though:1. The triple and double rings are oversized. If you are a serious thrower this might not be your board.2. The instruction manual for the games is a bit lacking. This leaves you having to guess at some of the rules."
3,"Fun, cheesy board - not too durable","Great ideas w/ the laster toe line and trash talking but the ""bristle"" is some swirly, spongy mess. After using it alot the past 3 months, the dividers are falling off after getting hit so much because they're so big. The triple and double sections are easy to hit because they're about twice as big as they should be. Fun board but the target sizes aren't comparable to most dartboards."
1,"DETAILS, DETAILS","This would be an okay dartboard except for one minor detail...........the word ATTEMPT is spelled ATTMEPT on the dartboard. I called Regent Sports directly to have them send me a replacement. They assured me there are ""NO words spelled incorrectly"" on their dartboards. Am I the only one who noticed? What about their buyers?"
2,Power Point IS for dummies,I must be smart or something because I already new most of what I was reading. I guess I thought there was more to Powerpoint than there is.
3,Powerpoint Review,"Easy to use, contains some useless info. Worked fine for getting me aquainted with Powerpoint"
3,Powerpoint,This is not a book that you read and review. You look for a particular bit of information at specific times when you work with the system. It is informative and helpful in many cases and in some cases it is not.
5,Beader's heart,This is a great book and has so many patterns that are well drawn out. A compliment to any beader's collection.
2,Boring,"This is a fairly new book but it feels outdated and old, the colors are muted and the jewelry is not inspiring. I didn't find any projects in this book I would like to make and this book is not even pretty to look at. Buy the Easy Beading books instead, they're full of great ideas."
2,Not inspiring,"I've had this book a few years and I've never got any inspiration from this one. It feels outdated, colorless and the projects are boring. There are better books to buy out there."
2,Unfinished,"It seemed to be a series of unfinished stories, with maybe a chapter of each story. I expected it to be more of a coherent novel and I was very much disappointed. I would not recommend this book."
1,Terrible quality + expensive,"I bought this to run some wire for a 5.1 setup in my bedroom.First: when separating the pos/neg I had to use a tool and pull just right or the jacket would rip away from the wire leaving it exposed.Second: the individually stranded wires snap away easily, even if you're using a wire stripper.Third: you can go to Radioshack and by 100 feet of 16 gauge (the Philips is here is 18) for 19.99 that has a thicker jacket and is rated for in wall use. Much sturdier, thicker wires, and with more strands.Fourth: I don't believe that this role of wire is actually 100ft. It didn't even come close to being able to run up through my ceiling in my master bedroom. The Radioshack wire went further and I still have wire left. I'm also getting much crisper and cleaner highs. My sound is much more defined and open.I'm running a Denon 2808Ci with Mirage Nanosat satellite speakers."
4,Not in Baltimore!,"I've become a Laura Lippman fan with the first two Tess Monaghans and several stand alones, but I think she is at her best when the setting is Baltimore (as in the first two in this series). This one (number 4 in the series I inadvertantly read them out of order and now will move on to number 3) has Tess going to Texas to find and help Crow, and that was my only problem with this one. The setting didn't seem as real as the first two Tess books I love the stories and the characters but I missed the setting on this one which is so much a part of them."
2,"Misleading Item, But beautiful","Very simple. It looks just like it is in the picture - that's NOT the problem. The problem is that the song is incomplete. It goes ""You are my sunshine, my only sun shine, you make me happy, when skies are grey... so don't take my sunshine away"" - it's missing ""You never know dear, how much I love you...."" I called up and they say ""It's not a mistake, that's how it's manufactured."" REALLY? If I knew that, I would have NEVER purchased it. I kept it JUST for the cosmetic value."
5,together in Love,"After Roberta Kreider's first book, ""From Wounded Hearts"" this secondbook ""Together in Love"" was eagerly awaited and it does not disappoint.Gay or straight you will find couples stories that will surprise and touch you. Even a heterosexual couple who got back together after a gender change in the husband. Truly love conquers all!"
4,Nice pennant,"This is a nice mini pennant on my wall, it adds decoration. It came with Brownie the elf instead of the Cleveland Browns helmet on it, that doesn't bother me. Its still a nice pennant to put on the wall. Reccomended"
4,A pretty good Pilates workout,"I thought this video was a very doable beginner Pilates workout. My only hesitation in recommending it would be that the two instructors look as though they've had extensive plastic surgery in acquiring their perfect bodies. So, much as we'd all like to look like them as we're doing our exercises, unless we've laid out the cash for the breast implants, liposuction, and tummy tucks, I don't know if we have much of a chance.I gave it 4 stars for Janice's instruction by the way. You can tell she does this for a living and genuinely wants you to succeed. Eloise is (surprise, surprise) a former Playboy model and the wife of billionaire, John Paul Dejoria (of Paul Mitchell hair products), who probably paid for the production of the 4 videos because he or she, plugs in their own little Paul Mitchell ad at the end of the DVD.They do have a nice mansion though, and it is nice seeing how the other 2% of the country lives."
3,I wish I had a better description.,I love this costume on my little boy. I didn't understand the sizing for an extra small I wish they wore more specific. I had to layer this outfit cause Halloween was very cold.
2,Movin'Sit Air Cushion limited use,"My Physical Therapist recommended the Movin'Sit Air Cushion in order to shift my spine into a better position to relieve pressure. I purchased two, one for my office and one for my car. I found it impossible to use one in my car as I am tall 6'1"" and no matter how much little air I put into the cushion it still kept me up too high and unstable for safe driving. In the office I find it to be too narrow/small. I find myself trying to balance myself on it constantly. I stopped using both because of these difficulties. In addition it there is no easy valve to blow up the cushion. There is a small hole with a long plastic stem and basically you have to get a mouthfull of the back of the cushion in order to blow any air into it.I believe it might work better for people of a smaller size."
2,Big disappointment!,"This book, I feel, was not as good as the critics said it was. IIt just did not interest me the way I thoght it would. I did enjoy learning about the history of blacks in Chicago. It was boring to me because of the format in which it was written. The book just did not click with me."
4,dog harness figure 8,i really like this harness. simple to adjust and use & it doesn't slip around like others i've tried. it also isn't tight & rubbing behind the back of the front leags like others i've used.great product!
3,Funny,"NFL Networks puts out some great productions. This one is funny but it seems to have the same scenes as quite a few of their other DVD's they've put out. If you don't already have a large NFL DVD collection, then this one is definitely a good buy. If you've already got some of the other's produced around this time frame, then you may get more of the same thing you've already got. It's still pretty funny to watch though and I'm glad I bought it."
4,Texas history,The book was well written and kept my interest from start to finish. There were facts included that this reader had not known untill reading this book. Very good.
1,Not sure,"Hi,I checked out their website and I own a Fendi purse which I had brought from Saks Fifth Avenue. And ofcurse it is original. I was looking at Fendi bags on their website and saw one exactly like mine. Even in picture the leather looks cheaper than the one I own and the Fendi Logo on top also has Spelled Fendi on mine which this one doesn't. #rd difference I noticed was the serial number. On Original Fendi bags the number is on the inside pocket in a tag not on the engraved leather, And this is how they say their's is. I am not sure if they have the Authentic bags. Please be sure before you spend any big bucks!"
4,"Great Price, Great Camera","At first I was a little put off just because of the cameras price, thinking maybe it was a inexepenisve because it was janky. But Although its a litttle shaky, its a great camera. Worth the 250!"
4,Great for the price,"I got the samsung SCM 51 recently and love it. It's got great features for the price. This does not have a remote (SCM 52 and 53 does), but for the sub 200 price tag I don't think you will find a better camcorder. I wanted to use this for a couple of years till the digital technology comes of age. For starters, its a great camcorder. The picture quality is pretty good and the sound is great. You don't have to scream to be heard. The 22x optical zoom and the 440x digital zoom are outstanding. A great starters camcorder for the price. I would recommend this for anyone buying their first camcorder."
2,Uh HUN,"Hello,peole don't buy this thing BORRING very shakey!!!!!I hated it poor color aand zoom if u want a good CAmera Try jvc products"
1,Poorly designed - Returned it,"Quality is excellent but design is poor.The bag is way too tall and top heavy which makes the bag flop over.The top closure mechanism consists of two heavy steel bars making most of the bag weight at the top.There is nothing to provide rigidity on the sides. Only flimsy canvas.It will never stand up straight unless it is stuffed full of tools.If you stuffed it full enough with tools to keep it from flopping over, you would have to empty it out every time you wanted a tool at or near the bottom.Might be good to carry two bowling balls.Really dumb design. Lots of quality. Zero engineering."
2,Entertaining but overpriced.,This book is all about silly little quotes on shoes with only a few lines on each page. You can finish the whole book in less than 15 minutes. It's not worth the price.
3,for the shoe lovers in your life,"BOOTISM is a silly glossy little something, with quotes, exercises & interviews in eye-catching 4-color graphics. It is a perfect fit to bring chuckles. A good gift for those who dream about shoes while managing to control their addiction ... maybe.Simple & delightful."
5,So Lovely,"Lisa Marie Presley releases her debut album and in true Presley fashion, she carries the crown. Presley dramatically wowed audiences when she performed ""Nobody Noticed It"" on VH1 as a tribute to her father, Elvis. To Whom It May Concern promises a raw and heartfelt expression of who Lisa Marie is, uncensored. Although it is clear that she is still developing as both asongwriter and a singer, her music and lyrics envelops you in Lisa Marie's world and all of her experiences. Her voice, deep and rich resonating when you turn up the speakers, provides a quality of experience, one possessed by someone who has come a long way. A lovely escape to a world unbound by pretentious emotion and enlightened by salvation."
3,A good mix of songs,"Take the producers of the debut albums of Tori Amos and Fiona Apple, blend in the sound of Sheryl Crow and you have the debut album from Lisa Marie Presley.I'm not saying she's copying those artists, but striking a resemblance to their work in this album. She doesn't have the best voice but makes use of it like she should."
3,Little Lisa has grown up,"I loved this CD. She has a little bit of refining to do, but I am sure she will get there. Her songs are all written by her and they are meaningful. I truly enjoyed it."
2,Huh? What are those lyrics again?,"Not a bad voice for a particular kind of song and genre, but honestly now - how many of you out there can actually understand all the lyrics in all the songs? I can't, and that was Part One of my criticism of this debut CD. Part Two: far too similar tones and strains cross songs, making many of them seem like modified clones of others. ""Lights Out"" is the best of the tracks, and, sorry to say, the only one worth listening to more than once. Hopefully, Ms. Presley will improve her sense of variety and tone the angst down a bit - it will wear thin if it follows her album to album. The potential is there, but it requires some serious re-evaluation in terms of lyrics, delivery and subject matter."
1,I'll Pass,"Although I think Lisa Marie has a sultry, smokey voice, somewhat reminiscent of Elvis, I did not like this CD. The songs all sounded alike and you couldn't understand the words. The only words you could make out were cuss words. I think she could be pretty good with a few changes. I'm not sure Elvis would be too proud of this effort. I gave the CD away."
3,Not prepared for the bad language,"I personally was not prepared for the language on this cd. It may have been labeled, but I overlooked it. Lisa Marie is so incedibly talented but beware, there is profanity in many of her songs. It is going to be difficult for me to enjoy this cd without getting offended. I am not sure I will keep it and this upsets me. I wish she could have released a cd without these words but she would probably consider this to be sacrificing her artistic integrity."
1,What has this world come to??,"I love all types of music, was a huge Elvis fan, but cannot figure out for the life of me why anyone would consider Lisa Marie to have even a hint of talent.This girl cannot sing. She moans and growls and slurs her words. Other than the profane language, you cannot understand a word she sings. She made a complete jerk of herself on the Tonight Show. I think even Jay was embarrassed for her. She cannot even hardly carry on a conversation.Bottom Line: Do not waste your money on this cd because it is total garbage."
2,Not a good cd to buy,"We purchased this cd just to see how well she sings and also we have always been a Elvis Presley fan. Her singing is not really bad but her voice sounds the same on ever song, you can't tell the difference from song to song. But what is really bad about this cd is the words she uses some really profane words through out the album and we took it back and got a refund. There is no warning on the cd. We have kids and this is not a cd for kids and definitely not for us. The reason for two stars is because her singing is not terrible."
1,The Kings didn't Rub off on Her,"Being the Daughter or Elvis&Married to Michael Jackson didn't rub off on Lisa Marie as a Artist at least.She is just there trying hard to find Her Musical self.sounding like a Cross Between a 2nd-3rd rate Alanis Moressette,Cher&Sheryl Crow all Rolled into without a Direction.the Vocals are Clumsy at best&the music is a dime a dozen it makes sense why it took so long to get this Album released.I See Lisa Marie with a Career closer to Latoya Jackson than to either Her Father or Michael's."
2,"Oh, here we go..","She wants to be independent, yet she follows in daddy's footsteps. Somehow, that doesn't sound like independence to me. It seems that little Lisa Marie is taking advantage of her father's fame to get a recording contract, because anyone with some talent at recognizing talent knows that she can't sing.When she talks, she sounds like a man, so that's all I'll say about her singing. As far as this album goes musicaly and lyricaly wise, it's a joke. A million dollar endorsed joke. Then again, this is the same woman who married Michael Jackson.That's all that I have to say about this..er..performer."
3,HER AND CHER SHOULD RETIRE TOGETHER!,"Okay, so the 35 year-old's new album is good, and so she's pretty, but the...new CD is a mixed bag. Her new single is good, i'd give it 4.5/5 stars but the whole cd, it isn't that special...there's a few goodies, but all the rest is just the plain usual pop/rock. Nice try, but give it up, you'll never live up to your dad..."
1,"""oh I love dolls""","""oh i love to make love to dolls"" ""i need to talk about michael jackson to sell my record"" ""i'm elvis's daughter so I can automatically sing"" whatever lisa."
3,Not As Good As I Expected...,"I guess I'm the exact opposite than most people. Most critics weren't expecting a lot from Lisa Marie's CD and then they liked it better than expected. I, on the other hand, thought I'd love her debut work and I'm not that impressed. Lights Out has been one of my favorite songs of 2003 but I was still reluctant to buy To Whom It May Concern. Then I saw the video for Sinking In and I absolutely loved the vid and the song. So then I was convinced that I had to have this CD. I've only listened two or three times, which is usually all it takes for me to like a CD, but I can't give it more than three stars as of now. Lights Out and Sinking In are the only songs I really like. Though most of the tracks aren't that impressive, I love her voice. Lisa Marie is a real talent just like her father and that's undeniable, in my opinion."
5,IMPRESSIVE...A PLEASANT SURPRISE...,"Lisa Marie has made a knock-out album. I was reluctant to buy it, I really don't know why...I guess all the hoopla...but, I was drawn to it nonetheless. First time I put in it the cd player I was amazed and delighted. I've been listening to it for a week and it's just getting better. Kudos!!!"
4,Lisa Marie steps out of her father's shadow,"Lisa Marie's smoky vocal delivery makes this album worthwhile. ""S.O.B"" and ""Lights Out"" are standouts, both giving a scathing criticism of both her personal life and family legacy. Lisa Marie has competent songwriting skills, though some of her songs could have been more lyrically diverse. A great step in what may be a promising musical career."
5,I loved it,"I love her voice and the lyrics she wrote were amazing. On this album you'll find songs about her children Riley and Benjamin Keough, her father Elvis, ex-husband Michael Jackson, and ex-husband Danny Keough...to name a few."
4,Not bad at all,"I'd been curious about this CD for a long time, and was impressed by the single ""Lights Out"" when it came out, so I finally decided to give the whole thing a listen. My opinion? It's really not bad at all. Lisa Marie is not a technically superior singer, but I prefer her husky, raspy, evocative voice to Britney's girlishness or X-Tina's oversinging any day. The sound of the record is mostly bluesy, textured modern rock with a slight country tinge. The songwriting is honest, autobiographical, sincere and a little dark. It's clear that, despite her fortune and famous heritage, Lisa Marie's life has not been an easy one. Overall, a pretty good debut. If Lisa Marie grows as a songwriter and performer, she might have a shot at being a great musical artist on her own terms.Highlights: ""S.O.B."", ""Lights Out"", ""Indifferent"""
2,If You Love Good Music then dont believe the hype,"... Hey, the album is so-so. One good song--lights out, and more of the same sounding songs on the rest of the album. Her voice is ok, but is muddy and hidden in the music. The only words you can clearly hear are the cuss words--how old is this woman? Try the Kathleen Edwards cd for great new music in the same style. Skip this one for sure if buying it for your kids. I have never understood the blatant use of profanity in a song for shock value alone--shouldnt your music stand on its own??"
1,YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING!!,"I cannot believe the glowing reviews I'm readinghere. I picked this up on a whim, and haven'tbeen so bored by a CD in many moons. Face it,were it not for the Presley name (and the WackoJacko curiosity factor) this ""artist"" wouldn'thave a record deal. Any unknown singer withLisa's minimal talent wouldn't get past thefirst round of ""American Idol"", let alone getthe media push this woman has received. I knowit must be tough having to live in the shadowof such a legacy as her father's. But come on,Lisa Marie, you must have other ways to keepbusy! BUH-BYE!!"
2,Not Impressed,"This album gave me a migraine, not sure why. Maybe Presley's sound just doesn't do it for me, but I did like the first single ""Lights Out"". The lyrics are strong, she is obviously a talented songwriter, but I'm not a fan of the overproduction and her great voice drowned out through most of the track."
1,SHE CAN'T SING,"THIS CD IS AWFUL. I DON'T KNOW WHY I BOUGHT IT. SHE'S HORRIBLE. BUY KELLY CLARKSON'S CD INSTEAD. AT LEAST KELLY CAN SING. HER DADDY ELVIS MAY BE A GREAT SINGER, BUT LISA MARIE IS HORRIBLE."
1,She is Know Elvis,She should pack it up now and enjoy the monies. This music is not good. Poor taste!
2,less than solid,"The opening song,""Sinking In,"" in which she rails against a lover's expectations, emphasizes his faults in a manner that feels very Morissette-ish. ""Gone"" is a lethargic elegy to romantic betrayal, while ""Indifferent"" is a dreary falling-apart song that seems right out of the British Miserablist school of songwriting. On the album's rough-edged opener, ""S.O.B.,"" Presley projects a snarling toughness, though the cussing here and on several other cuts feels more flavorful than convincing."
4,"Loving this CD, but thank God for the printed lyrics inside","I love her voice but I had to read the lyrics to understand what she was saying on many of the songs. My favorites are ""SOB"", ""Lights Out"", and ""So Lovely"". I wasn't sure I was going to like it the first time I listened to the whole thing but the more I listen to it the more I like it."
1,Where's Lisa Marie's voice ??,"The background music on this CD was so loud, it was as if the producers were hiding her voice. Her voice, when you could hear it, seemed adequate, so I don't know what the producers were afraid of. The first song on the CD ""S.O.B."" was very good, but the rest all sounded the same.I bought Kelly Clarkson's ""Thankful"" CD the same day. What a difference! Her voice is strong & clear and each song is a unique gem. I found myself humming her songs all day, while I couldn't even remember any of Lisa Marie's..."
2,Didnt care for it,I bought this cd after listening to sound bites of it but it just didnt cut it for me .I think she has a great voice but most of the time her vocals are so garbled with the music you cant tell what she's saying .Also im no prude but the profanity distracted from my enjoyment .Maybe her next one will be better .
1,Not worth it if Live performance is what counts,"I just got done suffering through her so-called ""performance"" on the Tonight Show. Not only were her vocals undecipherable but they were also horribly off key. At times I couldn't figure out if she was throwing up or ""singing"". The music could have been written by a four year old and even the swaying of her hips and stance, apparently the only decent attribute she carried over from her father, couldn't save this dreadful experience. Take some lessons, practice the songs, then write new ones and try again. Good luck, get it used, don't blow your money. I'm guessing that she was playing her ""hit"" and if that's the best she has, I don't know what the other reviews were reviewing because all I heard was crap."
2,Get a new producer fast!,"Lisa is drop dead gourgeous! Great cover, but what happened to this CD? She has a really great voice, but you would never be able to tell. She sounds like she is singing background vocals on her own record. This record is just poorly produced, and I sure hope she is smart enough to get a new producer by the time her follow up CD comes out. Her voice is a cross between Gwen Stafani and Melissa Ethridge, and is very sexy and raspy, if only you could hear her vocals. I am very dissapointed! I could not get through one song completely. To bad her dad was not around. He should of produced it!!"
5,Lisa Marie ROCKS!,"I think that Lisa Marie rocks! It takes a lot of valor to move forward with a singing career in the shadow of a daddy like Elvis. Not only do I love Lisa Marie's music, but I love her spirit. She should pay no mind to the small minded!"
5,One of 2003's best!,"I love, love, love ""To Whom It May Concern."" Lisa Marie Presley has a very unique and cool voice, these lyrics are so deep, meaningful and just downright awesome and the whole album is just rockin'. My favorite track is ""S.O.B.""I highly suggest picking up a copy of this album if you're thinking about it!"
2,To Whom It May Concern,I couldn't understand the words in Lisa Marie's songs. The music overpowered 99% of the songs. It's like she was hiding behind the music. The actual music was good but it would be nice to be able to understand the words.
3,Lisa Marie finding her song,"This was a good album. Lisa Marie surely has talent yet you can tell she is still finding herself. Her music is unique and enjoyable yet the profanity was a bit too much and tended to ruin some of her songs. I believe she has the capability to become a great singer. She sure has the voice for it. It would be nice to see her music without the profanity in the future. Her voice is beautiful and the lady has a style that is truly all her own. It is worth the purchase. However, if you have little ones around I would not play it around them."
4,Papa would be Proud,"I just wish she hadn't waited so long to put an album out but who can blame her?This is not some little pre-packaged pop-star. This lady has the goods. She's got it all. Hell, I can't wait till her next album comes out. Lights Out: every time I hear it I start crying. There is only one other singer that has ever made me cry and that's Billie Holliday. Do yourself a favor and pick up this disc. She's as cool as her daddy was!"
4,To whom it may concern...,I really have been enjoying this CD. I got it a few hours ago and have listened to it twice already. The lyrics are great for the dark mood times. It's musically satisfying too. I hope it does well and doesn't get caught up in the comparison game.
4,You will be surprised!,"I can tell you that I didn't know what to expect when I purchased this album. I love the first single, ""Lights out."" I can say that this album is actually pretty good. The bluesy voice is great. The songs are very personal. If you want deep lyrics and a good voice...purchase this album."
2,gloomy,"I enjoyed the first song Lisa Marie did as a video and found her refreshing after all the body shaking others. She seems so real. However this cd is far to gloomy. She seems to ""moan"" through many of the songs and feels like a lot of ""feeling sorry for myself"" kind of stuff. She should celebrate who she is! disappointing"
3,"can I buy a ""clean"" version?","I enjoyed the music. Lisa Marie's lyrics are thoughtful and well sung.However, the explicit vocabulary peppered throughout the lyrics - ""fxxxxxx"" seems to come through clearer than many of the other words - I could do without. I'd prefer a ""clean"" version so the music can be enjoyed by my whole family."
3,Slicky produced but where's the natural setting?,"As i read through all the reviews half of the people think therecord is fantastic,a triumph and so forth. The Opposing half think it's slickly produced music with a bad singer. Now, I agree on both sides - somewhat. The record is VERY well produced ( a little too slick and polished if you ask me)and yes, they often cover her voice up with background vocals and loud music. Now the question is ..can she sing? I truly can't answer that becuz nobody has seen her just with a microphone with in a natural setting ( without the loud and bangin music)...untill then, i give it a thumbs up."
1,Ugh! Who told Lisa she can sing?,Why does everyone always make the assumption that just because someone is the son or daughter of someone famous that it means he or she is talented too? Lisa Marie is a terrible singer. The only reason why she's in the spotlight is because she's rich and the daughter of someone famous. She'll be forgotten in 5 years.
1,THE QUEEN SHE IS NOT,"The Princess of the King of rock and roll doesnt lack vocal talent but song writting is definitly not her stong point. Lisa Marie Presly seems to be a bitter depressing person, the way she sings her songs and the style they are is just boring. I will say she has a cool voice very P!NKish and maybe a one day cher if she impreoves her songs. I sold this cd a month after buying it I wanted to like it but I just couldnt....I knew it wasnt gonna be the best thing but this is really sad.1. S.O.B.(1/10)2. The Road Between(1/10)3. Lights Out(8/10)4. Better Beware(4/10)5. Nobody Noticed It(0/10)6. Sinking In(2/10)7. Important(1/10)8. So Lovely(0/10)9. Indifferent(0/10)10. Gone(1/10)11. To Whom It May Concern(4/10)overall 22/111 19%F"
3,A Promising Start,"The first thing you notice about Lisa Marie Presley's debut effort(beyond the fact that she has a pretty potent set of lungs)is that it's better than anyone ever imagined it could or would be. That's not to say that it's going to change the face of music as we know it, but that's best left up to the U2s and Madonnas of the world. No, what we have here is a highly listenable, occasionally stunning, fusion of pop, rock, country, et al. As with most records, the album's first single is also it's best track, but those who up till now have compared Presley to Sheryl Crow won't see much justification of that beyond 'Lights Out'. The rest of the album is less uptempo, more intropsective, with some of the songs sounding a little too similar to each other to distinguish themselves much. Still, there's alot to like here, and her tendency for self indulgency and profanity aside, this is a promising start for someone who hopefully will be thought of as something other than Elvis' daughter."
5,ADDICTIVE !!! BUT IN A GOOD WAY!!!,"Being a big Elvis fan I have always followed Lisa Marie in the magazines and was so glad to hear she was going to record an album...and I am not disappointed. I can't quit listening to it and the wonderful lyrics. She really does bare her soul to us and makes us realize that just because she has the Presley name doesn't mean that life has been a bowl of cherries. Her voice is just beautiful and I like seeing her on shows being who she is by saying how nervous she is about singing in front of an audience..I like her Tell It Like It Is attitude and that is what you get in the CD from her dad, to her kids and everyone in between...and its not Rap Music..Thank God."
2,"I applaud the effort, but collection falls short","Like most previous reviewers, I bought this out of curiousity. I am a big fan of the King and thought that I should buy this out of respect for Lisa-Marie, who has big shoes to fill and a lot at stake if she fails. 'Light's On' is a good gutsy pop song and deserved a charting and 'So Lovely' is subtly delivered, showing that she can operate on different levels, but the rest left me confused. The voice is just ok and the production (given the calibre of producers on this album) is not good. Her voice is husky and in some places I struggle to hear the lyrics. The remainder of the songs are just mediocre. I'm sorry to all other reviewers who gave this a good rating, but I just don't see it. It is just a mediocre album from a very average singer. I applaud her for the effort. it must have been daunting (hence, the 2 stars)."
2,Yuk,"Like many people, I bought this cd out of couriosity, but at the same time, I was just so sure it was going to be good. I read many reviews, and they all seemed to love Lights Out. I really wish I could say the same(mainly because I hate wasting money on a cd I won't listen to), but I can't. I think this cd is awful. LMP's voice is ok, but her song's don't give her a chance to shine~ if she can. To my disappointment, Lights Out is the best track on the cd. Incidentally, none of the reviews I read mentioned the fact that LMP uses the ""f"" word in several songs."
3,The best music a computer can enhance,"Ok so thats a little harsh, even though the songs are the musical equivalent of a heavily airbrushed Playboy photograph, there is something here.Obviously Lisa Marie is not the only artist that is heavily computer enhanced, its the standard today, with artists like Faith Hill and other country acts seemingly becoming so enhanced that their voices sound metallic and ridiculously distorted.But anyway as far as above average pop fare this music is upbeat in its sadness and easy on the ears.As far as the parallels with her fathers music, well Elvis projected his soul out into his music, and this music is more a reflection of your standard pop music, it seems a little self indulgent at times, but still overall pretty catchy and fun."
2,Not that good to me! Too many bland rock songs!,"I didn't like Lisa Marie Presley's album. I only liked four of the songs. The other seven are a batch of disconnected, cold, bland, forgettable, disjointed rock songs. The writing's so bad; she sounds like she has an attitude problem on many of them. I think she's riding on her famous dad Elvis' name, but this album doesn't tell me too much about her. Otherwise, just pass on this one!"
4,A pleasant surprise,I was very skeptical at first since it took so long for Lisa Marie to release an album. But I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised. I love the sultry sound of her voice and the emotional way she sings. I like it! Give this album a listen before you write her off as just trying to cash in on her fathers name or her tabloid publicity.
4,QUITE A DEBUT!,"Having been so many years in the making, it is wonderful that LMP's debut release is finally here! It is well worth the wait! She possesses strong chops that sort of combine Sheryl Crow with Wynonna with Bonnie Raitt....she can be gritty on S.O.B. and then turn to a personal statement on SO LOVELY or tell the story of her history on the stellar debut rocker single LIGHTS OUT....the album is as good or better than most releases like it by other artists! Run out and buy this cd and give her the winning debut she deserves! Nice to have you in the ""building"" Lisa Marie! *Note- There is a hidden track after song 11*"
5,The Girl's Got It!,"Fabulous CD...Lisa Marie has got those Elvis genes...and she should wear it proudly....All of the songs are worth listening to, lots of emotion and heart. Good music! You Go Girl!!"
3,"Bold Lyrics, Blah Musicianship","I applaud this work for its bold lyrics and gritty realism. However, the songs begin to sound the same musically with repeat spins. I love the ""Lights Out"" song, but after that, it begins to sound like the same song over and over again because her tonality and range are so narrow. Having heard LMP perform live on the talk show circuit, you can see that she has a lot of help in the studio with pitch, etc. BUT, that said, I love that she finally put out a CD, and I think she will get better with time as she gets more sure of herself as a musician. You can definitely hear the Elvis genes in there peaking out around the edges."
5,"Elvis' daugther is not Elvis, but a rocker in her own right","Her diction is a lot harder to understand than her father's, but she is one groovy chick who does not mince words when she writes her own lyrics. My favorite female vocalist these days. Sultry, deep, emotional, tears at your heartstrings. Hard."
2,Poor design,More uncomfortable than my straps. Kept slipping sideways. Maybe someone else has better luck positioning them and keeping them there.
3,"Playboy really has trouble with the ""girl-girl"" thing!","If Hugh Hefner & Company want to make an erotic, sexy, girl-girl video, then I'm all for it! Unfortunately, ""Girlfriends"" isn't it. It's like they've got the women, the locales, and some top-quality production values, but no imagination! This could have been a really hot tape, but instead it's actually kind of bland, almost as if the director's heart just wasn't in it. Or maybe there was a writer's strike that week. Who knows?"
3,"Nice light read, mostly Self Help not Hiking","This is more of a self help book than a travel book. The author relates his self help philosophy to the hike he took through the App. trail. He makes no pretense that his thoughts are any deeper than they are and he has a good sense of humor. He seems like a genuinely happy go lucky type of guy and in that resgard, I'm not sure if he knows how to help people who don't have that same kind of make up. I would have liked more info on the hike itself. However the title definitely hints that it is a self help book. It was a nice light read."
4,Bought book for my husband,My husband is a hiking enthusiasts. I ordered this book for him and he loves it.
2,Too much philosophical vs AT,"Easy reading but a bit too much philosophical self-help rather then AT hiking.Probably 70% self help/ 30% hiking-ATExpected the reverse % on the focus. If I wanted a self help book I would have bought one.Easy reading, good humor."
1,Misleading!,"I purchased the Kindle version of this book while planning for an AT hike. I had expected a trail journal or personal saga. Instead I got a self-help book. Tapon gleaned 7 life lessons from his journey and expounds upon them. By way of example, he refers to two hikers his girlfriend, Lisa, met who ran out of money and had to get off the trail before reaching the end. His take is they blew their budget by spending too much time getting off the trail, staying in hotels and eating in restaurants. This encounter turns into a chapter on budgeting, living below your means and setting goals. If I had wanted a book on budgeting, living below my means and setting goals, I would have purchased one! I wanted a book on hiking the AT and was disappointed."
2,Misleading,"This was supposed to be about going, but really it's nothing more than a thinly veiled self help book with a heavy emphasis on money management. Even if you're having troubles with your finances, there much better help out there. I was looking for a book that actually had some ties to the AT and helpful hiker advice; not a book on savings accounts and resisting an upgrade to a flay screen TV."
1,Why do I care about his life opinions?,"I wanted to read another book about the AT. The author appears to love reading his own thoughts about ""life"". I could have watched this on Oprah. I ordered this because of the high ratings. I now realize friends and family must be a large part of the ratings. I am partially at fault. I should have read the the title more closely. I just assumed ""life lessons"" were more specific to hiking the trail. This book is, at least for someone interested in specific ideas and information about hiking the AT, worthless in that area. If you like self-help informational books then this is the ticket."
1,HYOH - blah-blah-lah,"I've read quite a few books on hiking the PCT and the AT but this is one book I found very easy to put down and then after a few chapters decided not to pick up again. I think it's amazing that someone can hike a long trail but some shouldn't write about it. The author spends way too much time being preachy about life than writing about the actual hike - which is where my interest is. Maybe it gets better, but there are too many other books out there to bother wasting time on this one. If you want to read a good hiking book, read Cheryl Strayed."
2,Very slow read,I found this book too laborious for my tastes. He has some good ideas but takes too many pages to express them. This read too much like an accounting or math book for me. I want to be entertained when I read an outdoors or backpacking book.
2,Too Touchy-Feely for me,"I read this book as part of my research on the AT. This book, however, was mostly about being a good human and doing what you can to be happy with the least amount of worldly things as possible. Although these lesson might be of some value to many people, it is by no beans a guide for the trail. To sum up what the author was saying: hiking the AT gives you a lot of time to think about what is really important and what type of life you want to lead."
2,Famous Overtures,"Did not like the way these musical pieces were ""interpretted"".Did not like the tempo and in one piece one of the instruments played a portion which I would say they played a flat instead of a natural note. This is based on hearing the same pieces played by someone else, it's just my opinion."
2,quality,this used to be a very good company at one time. i don't know what happened with there products.
2,Not their best.,"I should start by saying I am a fan of god is an astronaut. However, this was a very boring album. Every song blurred into the next. None of the tracks were particularly bad, but at the same time none were great. If you are interested in God is an Astronaut, or post-rock in general, I highly recommend the album Far From Refuge. There are songs on that album that will take you places you couldn't reach otherwise (in particular ""Beyond the Dieing Light""). Or you could go for the best and just pick up Mogwai :E"
5,Paderewski's rendition of Hungarian Rhapsody's perfect,"I've listened to Hungarian Rhapsody rendered by 3 different artists, and Paderewski's rendition's by far the best. In fact, his version compared to, say, Misha Dichter's in ""The #1 Piano Album"" is so much superior that I could not bear to listen to Misha's version. While Misha obviously paid plenty attention to technical details, Paderewski effortlessly captured the true beauty of the piece - and conveyed it with near perfection. If you love Liszt or Hungarian Rhapsody or Paderewski, buy this album. Or if you just love classical music at its best, get it too!"
5,You won't be disappointed,"This was the first CD I ever owned of the group after hearing them live at a men's conference. I own every single CD they've done. You won't be disappointed. Also, try to see them live. I've never been to a concert where the artists more effectively brought me into worship then these men."
4,Has the track I wanted,I bought this for the track 'Ask Aaron' - perfect. But I don't think much of the rest of the album. 4* as it's what I wanted.
2,"Doesn't do the job, but good quality","So, it was a toss up between the wooden and stainless reamer, and I opted for durability....personally I like the pulp, and therefore believe the reamer should be designed with sharp ribs to effectively scrape out all the good stuff. This reamer is not like this, and went back to Amazon. The s.s.finish was durable-looking, but obviously I did not put it through the test off time. I'm back to using a fork, which proves to be the most effective for me at this time."
3,Holy Basil softgels,"I believe supplements work. I take a number of other supplements regularly, and try to maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle, and was looking forward to trying out this Holy Basil. Unfortunately, after taking them as directed on the package for 30 days, I noticed no effects -good or bad- at all. Sometimes that happens. I have yet to find something that works the same for everybody, and they seem to work well for others here, but I can only comment on my own experience. For what it's worth, as I mentioned above I also did not experience any negative effects either, such as bad taste or indigestion from the capsules and found them easy to swallow. Herbal supplements can sometimes be hit and miss, and though these didn't work for me, I am hesitant to rate this product at anything less than neutral, because I do believe they do work for others."
5,Great Product,I love this product... it helps my mental well being... I have a very stressful job and this helps knock the edge off... I take 2 a day... I am never with out it... I have been taking it for a couple years now...
2,Poorly packaged,"One of the Holy Basil bottle is broken with lots of glass pieces in the box. The whole shipment is not properly packaged. Since there are so many little glass pieces, I have to throw the whole bottle away which is about $30 wasted."
4,New Chapter Holy Basil,"Holy Basil is claimed to be a natural remedy for its anti-inflammatory effects and antioxidant properties, but most well-known for its success in relieving stress. All of these effects are appealing to me and I trust New Chapter products to be pure and well prepared. This is one of those supplements that would take long and involved studies to prove, but is probably worth trying."
2,"Nice, but no real boost","I have not noticed any type of boost from taking this product. It does not leave any unpleasant aftertaste or gastric upset, but I didn't have any noticeable mood improvement from taking it consistently."
3,Not sure I can tell a difference...,"After taking this product for a week, I'm not sure I can tell what, if anything it is doing for me. Hence, my neutral review."
3,Didn't notice a difference,Never really noticed a difference in my stress levels or increased feelings of relaxation. Tried doubling the dose near the end and still noticed no effects.
5,Two words: Holy basil!,"I'd been suffering from stress-induced anxiety and had been considering treatment with an anti-depressant as a last resort...but I was not looking forward to the inevitable and uncomfortable adjustment period, especially over the holidays. My longtime acupuncturist had me try one of these capsules at my appointment last week -- I allowed the capsule to break in my mouth, and felt the subtle calming, uplifting effects almost immediately. This is not to say that it will work for everyone with anxiety or depression disorders...but it's definitely helping me through a difficult time. I cannot vouch for other manufacturers of this item; I do know New Chapter to be a reputable company offering high-quality products."
1,Holy congestion,"Caused excess sinus congestion and discharge. Also, drowziness during the day. Did not work for me at all. I gave it a fair try, too."
4,As Advertised,"These really do have a calming effect. I'm not sure about the health benefits that are claimed, but they do effect mood. As some others have written, there is an aftertaste. No problems with stomache upset, though."
5,Another Wonderful Hero by Gayle Wilson!,This was one of Gayle's most romantic and tormented hero's. I fell in love! No wonder Gayle is an award winning author! She is able to create characters that will remain with you long after you have finished her story! A recommended read if you love Gayle Wilson!
2,Not What I Had Hoped For,"I was hoping for a recording full of Gypsy drama and flair. Unfortunately, I did not find it in this recording. It seemed like the musicians were just going through the motions. Also, the sound quality was lacking. It was recorded at a low volume with an almost muddy sound quality. I would have prefered a more crisp sound. I would suggest looking into the other recordings that Amazon has to offer. There are quite a few other versions here that are more enjoyable."
1,sides will warp,"My husband bought one of these, and within a month the sides warped, creating a gap between the stainless steel and the particleboard inside. Unsightly, and nothing we can do to repair it. The particleboard will eventually rot I'm sure. Otherwise it's just like an ice chest on legs--convenient not to have to bend over to get a drink, but you have to fill it with ice, 20-40 pounds."
3,The Horror of it,The book was exactly as described by the seller. No problem there.I was a bit disappointed that I had already seen many of the photosbefore elsewhere. I expected more new material.
3,The Dullness of Things,"As much as I tried, I just couldn't enjoy The Center of Things. It's not badly written, and the characters are quirky and moderately interesting, but the plot ranged from dull to absurd. Despite being often bored, I read this novel until the end, trying to understand why it got so many great reviews and the New York Times selected it as a ""notable book"" of the year. It's not because the author is John McPhee's daughter, is it?"
4,Fun Story With Some Original Characters,"I really enjoyed reading this book! It may deserve five stars for originality and presentation. The heroin is vulnerable, funny, thoughtful, and vivid. The other characters, although all personality extremes, are entirely believable and equally vivid. The story is interesting and captivating - plenty of twists and turns. It would have been nice had it been longer, as it was one of those books that seems to end all too quickly. I will certainly be looking forward to Ms. McPhee's next work."
2,Not as much information as would have liked,"I bought this book along with The Complete Book of Food Counts by Corinne T. Netzer. This book (The Calorie Counter) only lists Calories (yes I know that's what the title says!) - I thought that they would list carbs, protein, etc. in addition to calories."
2,Too much label info,This calorie counter is full of calories for items that come with labels. i.e. it will have pages and pages of store-bought soups or salad dressings and then will have little or no information on something that doesn't come with a label (i.e. fruit servings) so you have to extrapolate form what they've listed. don't waste your money on something like this. you can read the label yourself.
1,Poor Quality,"The quality of the item was poor; it was poorly made and I had to return it. The leather seams were glued, coming up at the edges, it was disappointing. I returned the item to the seller after they provided the return address and an RMA number; 5 weeks later I am still awaiting my CREDIT to my account."
3,"typically decent delbert, with one exception","Delbert McClinton's version of Otis Redding's ""I've Got Dreams to Remember"" established him as one of the most authentically soulful white R&B singers around.Here he gives us ""I Want to Love You"" -- a heartfelt, tastefully-arranged number that is as good as R&B gets.The rest of the album is typical Delbert. And that's fine with me."
5,He's with us,"Delbert is one of the few that will do a show without a setlist or will alter it as he reacts to his audience. Not long ago I attended a festival that he headlined. I gave him a t-shirt with my logo on it and asked him to sign an LP for me..""I'm With You""..before he performed. Much to my delight,Delbert took the stage wearing the t-shirt and did 5 songs off the album he signed. All a coincidence?...I don't think so. It gave the title song new meaning and solidified the fan-performer bond. The music is timeless and hearing it on this album or live..it will sound the same. Try it and you'll see it's true."
5,the truth,When you play any of Delberts' albums you just hate for it to end. They always waiting for more. Waiting patiently for the next one.
5,my new found obsession is delbert!,bought his newest release a few weeks ago based on listening to opening song and 2 others. sort of a rockabillie like george throughgood and stevie ray vaughn. bought this cd with 2 others - love them! great bar music to drink or dance to. a southern influence with a bit of blues thrown in. recommend the never been rocked enough cd and the newest release.
1,Pfeh,"A booze-drenched (probably bourbon), tobacco-choked whine, replete with hackneyed ""y'alls"". No interest in listening to an old coot's self-indulgent and mundane life complaints. Not only pfeh, but also pfui."
1,Doesn't Work on my Wine Bottles,"Looked similar to a good stopper I had from years back but the resemblance ended there. Does not seal and simply slips out, very easily. My 20 Year old Zyliss works much better."
5,Very Cerebral!!!,An excellent book for HR Practitioners to take HR to the next level in their organizations. Line Managers must read this to help clearly define and execute workforce stategy as an off shoot to firm strategy and make HR accountable to help realize it. This book is very insightful and can be used as required reading for middle and senior managers in organizations. Take your time to read it and assimilate the concepts because these tools are very powerful.
5,Buy It,"Of all of the books about HR metrics, this is by far the best. Perhaps it is because the underlying philosophy matches my own (always a good way to start), but the book makes sense. Easily understandable and the application apparent."
2,"Love Richard, but not this video","For me, the best part of the video was the strip of fabric that came with the video, which I now use for yoga. The routine didn't stretch me out enough or relax me. And he does far too many windmills (gave me bursitis!). It's been a while since I've done the routine, but I seem to remember that he didn't hold the stretches long enough either. I suppose it's better than no stretching at all."
1,The Book is basically a 50000 word essay on common sense.,"It is long winding, never ending, thesis, which is totally non-practical in the real world...get out of being an academic and do some real work."
3,"Bad sound, bad Airplane, bad Grace, good Jorma and Jack","This is the worst live Airplane performance: the audio suck like hell: there is a whistle all over the recording, that'll make you ring your ears for hours and hours.Grace doesn't sing very well, she messes up every thing, David Freiberg is out of tune, the drums are out of beat.The only good left are the blues combo Jorma-Jack, that kept on rocking all times.Anyway it's an historic piece of music history: the end of the greatest psychedelic band in the world; but if you want a great live Jefferson live recording, check out ""Bless it's pointed little head"" of the first period, or ""Thirty seconds over winterland"", of the latest period."
3,Not their best live,"I am a huge fan of the Airplane, but they were more in their element in the studio. There has lately been released a number of recordings of concerts from different venues. Some of them are quite good. This was recorded at a point of transition and they had a new drummer. The performances are decent, but it's not the best sound design to carry the volume. Things get a little distorted. I guess the Grateful Dead set a live standard that is hard to match."
3,"Historic, yes; Great? Not So Much......","This is an interesting release. It documents the last Jeff Air show at Winterland in'72. There are good songs and bad ( the Papa John blues number is particularly grating) ones, but most of the band is in fine form. The biggest flaw is the pedestrian drumming of Johnny Barbata. He must have had a good drug connection or something, because his playing drags the Kaukonen/Casady axis back at every turn. Spencer Dryden (R.I.P.) was a phenomenal player who knew how to swing and if you compare this recording with ""Bless It's Pointed Little Head"" or the more recent ""Live At The Fillmore East"", his absence is huge!!! And the less said about David Freiberg, the better. Still, if you dig the Airplane, this is a very enjoyable set from one of the best 60's bands ever."
4,Last Flight Indeed,"This show is definately for the true die-hard fan of Jefferson Airplane. When the band is cooking, this show is very hot. Unfortunately Grace Slick is not in any other form here other than bad. I have several bootleg shows from Jefferson Starship from this era and Grace is often much better than she is here. The last night of the tour, a bit too much partying before the show? It definately shows in her performance.While the drumming from Johnny Barbata is rather heavy handed, it is definately sevicable for the band. Paul, Jack, Jorma and Papa John hold this show together and really make it worthwhile to listen to. I guess it's worthwhile to have for the ""Historic Show"" that it is, but there's a lot better live material out there of this band."
1,If it so good than why is it not available?,"I cant review this item...because it is not available for review. I have read the books by two of his wives...but his book is unavailble. I dont hate it, but I cant read it...it is no longer in print...typical."
2,Not worth the money.,"What I was looking for was a way to NOT scare someone off if I really liked them, and while this book was a bit witty, it is not substantial material. I would have enjoyed looking through it at my local library, or bookstore, but it is not worth having on my shelf. Just my opinion.(34, divorced, 3 kids- just started dating again)"
1,Hmmmm,The other reviews sound like they were all written by the same person or couple of people. It almost looks like someone was trying to stack the deck here. The book is a rehash of every other dating book you've already been bored by.
1,Get a life,"I saw these girls on Fashion Emergency a while ago. They went to college in Florida. Sounds like they recruited all of their sorority and college buddies to write reviews for them. Anyway, if you have to read a book on how to date or how not to date then you've got a bigger problem...Why can't people be themselves? That is why no one can find their right mate. They don't even know who they are themselves, how do they expect the person they date to know either? I know this book was written in good humor and I am all for a laugh but not a step by step guide to life. I can figure that out on my own."
5,A hilarious book - not just for those who are dating!,"When I read this book, I laughed outloud! Anyone who has ever dated will relate to this - both women and men alike. The authors have a very original and clever approach, and a sense of humor that is very refreshing! They touch on various aspects of dating, and find the humor in all of them. The characters in this book will remind you of either yourself or a friend, I guarantee it."
5,My jaw ached from laughing (even after my fifth read).,"A must for every guy and girl- the guys will relate all too well and the girls will laugh at their own psychotic tendencies- the stick figures and photos are hysterical- this book is sure to be the most popular one on any coffee table and you're guaranteed to laugh just as hard each time you pick it up! Buy this book now- pure comedy, trust me."
4,Go Go Girls!,"Black humor just got better! You go girls, please keep us all laughing (especially at ourselves)."
3,entertaining a fresh new light,"We have all read the books on how to keep a man....This book is written in a hilarious new light on the subject of ""dating"" in the '90's. There needs to be more refreshing humor like this on the market today. We take ourselves toooo seriously. Thank you for your candor."
5,Still some of my favorite!,These books are fantastic! I got them when i was about 9 and I still love them ten years later!!
3,I did the same thing but oppistie,"Hey guys with the mac version,I did the same thing as you but I am a mac user and accidentally ordered the windows version. When I realized it was to late to return it. Now I'm stuck with a program I can't use. If either of you still have your mac version maybe we can exchange. Let me know. Just post another comment and we can go from there."
1,message number 2,As I said in my last communication ...I am awaiting the correct version to come from the manufacturer. I was shipped the Mac version and needed the Vista version. I called the phone number on the packaging and it was the Manufacturer and I followed their instructions but have not gotten the correct version (book or disc).
2,BE CAREFUL - THIS IS A MAC PRODUCT,"The description does not say that this is a Macintosh product. The company actually does have a windows product that is available from their website.I haven't even used it yet because I have to return the Mac version and exchange it for the windows version, but the 2 stars is for AMAZON's poor description."
2,Okay - But Not As Pictured,"I was excited to find the case identical to the one I have been using for several years - with the dual belt clip (spring clip and snapping loop) and magnetic flap (no snaps or other hardware). After having read previous reviews about customers who didn't receive the product as advertised, I contacted the seller and specifically told them NOT to fill the order unless it was EXACTLY as pictured on their advertisement.After having received two cases with magnetic snaps on the flap (which is less secure and causes the flap to stick out from the case), I am sending them back. The seller has agreed to provide return shipping label and I am awaiting that now."
1,It's different from what you can see on the picture,Completely unsatisfied. The belt clip is different from what is shown on the picture. I am really disappointed.
4,History of a phrenological dynasty,"This well-researched volume describes the Fowler family, certainly the most well-known and colourful ""phrenological dynasty"" of the 19th century. Besides their obvious interest in Phrenology, the Fowlers were also active in the reform movement, advocating sex education (a highly controversial subject in those days), women's rights (protesting against the then fashionable tight-laced corsets), and architecture (with the idea of octagon buildings). The author clearly explains the important role played by Phrenology in the definition of 19th century American culture, and by the Fowlers in particular."
5,Now my favourite gym shorts,"First time I was wearing a seamless shorts. Felt good. I like how they make my legs look, and I'm overweight. That sure is motivation to go work out!"
5,Shenadoah is a classic,"Jimmy Stewart has many great films, but Shenandoah is one of his best. The struggle of the Stewart character to keep his family out of the Civil War is deeply moving. It is only when the North captures Stewart's youngest son that he is forced to take action.The Far Country and Bend of the River are also good movies, but I would buy this again just for Shenandoah."
5,"Great support stockings, fit well, hold up well","For use with varicose veins. I used the manufacturer's measurements to size the hose. They fit well, are durable, and have held up well. Would buy again."
1,No Rings Included,"Just to let buyers know that even though the rings are pictured on the cover of the video, They DO NOT come with the video."
2,disappointed,"I really didn't need the video, I needed the toning bands. Since my original came with them I assumed they would come with this one too. When the package came it was only the video and not the bands. It surprised me because it was supposed to be new. Had I known it would just be the video I wouldn't have bothered ordering it. The company that sold the video very graciously gave me a credit for the video and told me not to return it which was very nice of them."
4,"Good romance, despite hairy hero","I liked this story a lot and would have given it five stars if not for the really obvious villain and incredibly hairy hero. This is one of those instances where the writer should have left more to the imagination. Egan was a great and romantic lead, but I was completely turned off by descriptions of Glenda(ugly name) entwining her fingers in the hero's abundant chest hair and how his legs were well covered with thick black hair. Yuck!Still, I like the chemistry and history between Glenda and Egan. I do find it hard to believe, however, that a woman could live in close proximity to a man for eight years and not be aware of the fact that he was in love with her. I imagine her husband would have noticed it as well. Still, I enjoyed the story and plan to read more books by Ms. James."
3,Not What I expected...,"After reading another review, I was expecting this book to be horrible. However, it wasn't bad, although it's definitely not something I would usually read.Another review made a point of saying that the hero forced himself on the heroine several times. This is NOT true. I'm saying right now that nothing of the kind happens in the book. I was looking out especially for it, as I despise stories with rape in them.All in all, it was an easily predictable and not too mentally taxing read. I found neither the hero nor heroine altogether likable - or intelligent - but I'm sure I'm being too hard on it. If you like this subgenre, then you may enjoy this book."
2,Couldn't make myself finish it.,"Yet again, another totally irritating heroine that I wished the hero would have dropped in a well. She loves to ""flash fury"" and say anything because she just can't help it and of course cannot own up to it later. She shreds him emotionally then poof takes off her clothes and wonders why he isn't going to give in easily. I just couldn't bear it anymore. At first just skimmed over sections, then finally said enough, I don't have to waste my time on this tripe. Very sorry I bought this book & it's going in the for sale bag."
4,His Wicked Promise,"Egan MacBain had married Glenda MacKay because he thought he loved her. Though Glenda had been recently widowed, her heart belonged to her deceased husband Niall. She had looked to Egan for protection though he was prepared to offer her much more. This novel has some very sensual moments and strong conflict, but there are times where Egan comes off as boorish. Glenda isn't doing much to stand up to him or fight back when his behavior is demanding. She could have been a much stronger heroine, and Egan could have learned some tenderness here."
2,Disappointing,"I loved ""His Wicked Ways"" and I was really looking forward to Glenda's story, but this was a huge disappointment. Glenda was annoying...she was always rebuffing Egan who has loved her for years. She wants him but then feels this unreasonable guilt b/c her dead husband. I couldn't even finish the book b/c I hated Glenda so much and felt sorry for Egan. Glenda was, by far, the worst heroine ever!"
4,Timer trippers,"Easy to use but a little sloppy to handle. You want to make sure that the power is off before you install these little guys as dropping one into the mechanism can get a little hairy trying to fish it out. They work well and are easy to adjust but watch the packaging as parts are easily missed when opening. I like the color differentiation also, makes the usage a little easier to organize, less confusion."
3,hard to mess this up,Did exactly what they were supposed to do. Shipped quickly and replaced the set I had lost. I eventually managed to find another set in a store which I bought in case I eventually lose these.
1,Inaccurate description,Description states 2 ON and 2 OFF trippers but I received 2 OFF trippers and 2 different ON trippers used for two different timers. One of the ON trippers is used for the T100 timer and the other ON tripper is used for T101 timer.
2,Too small,"I had a house with a pool 25 years ago, with an Intermatic timer. I found the trippers very hard to adjust through the year, since the screw heads are so small and the screws need to be fairly tight. Now I am in another house with a pool, and the same model timer, and the same trippers - they have not changed in all that time. You need to use pliers to adjust the trip settings, and before long the screw heads are worn, which makes the pliers slip. I'm amazed that there seem to be no trippers available with larger (wider) screw heads."
3,Helpful but not insightful,"I was looking for something that would give me a more practical approach to obdience training and what to expect. The book is helpful, but the story approach wasn't what I was looking for in an obedience guide. I would have preferred more details being in the obedience ring rather than the tale of the author and his dog through their preparation for obedience competition."
1,Pretentious and predictable,A rather superficial and amateurish attempt at commentary on a profound and classical text.
2,Poor Vince couldn't get anything right!,"First he mucked up all those nominations. Then he went and killed himself in a park with two identical cannons, confusing those nutty Park Police--and me. I couldn't tell after reading _Strange Death...._ if the Park Police got the position of the body re: cannons wrong in their report or if they actually moved the body because they were *about* to get it wrong in their report. I guess I could've gone back and figured out what the author was claiming, but who wants to wade back through that stuff. I'll read _Washington Tragedy_ by Dan Moldea instead."
1,A Bunch of Hogwash,"Unsubstantiated claims that have all been later refuted. A partisan attempt to make a tragic and sad incident into political fodder. This author will sink to the lowest levels to make a buck. Read ""Anatomy of a Scandal"" and if you still believe Christopher Ruddy then I have a pyramid scheme you might be interested in where you can make tons of money for doing practically nothing! Oh, and I got a kick out of the review that mentions that everyone from ""Rush Limbaugh to Jerry Falwell"" believes Ruddy - gee what a broad spectrum of people! Must cover at least... gee... I don't know... three people?"
1,The Strange Death of the Truth,"This book is nothing more than a compilation of hypothetical ""what ifs."" The author posits no evidence and does nothing more than simply spew forth his opinion that the Clintons are evil and therefore must be up to foul play. Treat this book like the hogwash that it is."
5,"An OUTSTANDING read, I highly recommend it.","I can add little more to what those before me have said, except that I would recommend this to anyone who has any question in their minds about how honest this present regime is in their dealings with the public. By reading this book I understand they can even screw up a coverup, even better than Dick Nixon, except he didn't have anybody killed. I wonder how long it will be before those of us who order books like this over the internet are kept track of on the 'Big Computer?' Buy it, read it and pass it along."
1,this book is horrible!,"This book is truly horrible. Merzel spends most of the book making the following points:1. you must never criticize your teacher 2. if the teacher commits actions that seems ""immoral"" they are just to bring you to enlightenment 3. you have to give up home and family to practice zenFunny to think that Merzel and Joko Beck are both Dharma heirs of Maezumi Roshi, since they are exact opposites. Don't buy this book! Read Joko instead.This book sets back Zen in America to the dark ages..."
4,I Never Thought Rock Climbing Could Be Interesting!,This is a breathtaking movie when the climbers are hanging off mountains. It also has really funny moments. I enjoyed it and learned a lot but most of all it was fun.
4,"Episodes 5, 6, and 7 are great!","These three episodes may not contain non-stop fighting, but there is still a lot going on in each of them. Still, there is plenty of combat in each episode.The main theme in each of these episodes revolves around Gohan. In the beginning he is afraid of his own shadow. He encounters a few challenges, and as he overcomes each he becomes more and more bold. Not all of the situations come out in his favor, but even these are necessary for his 'training'.Overall, I would say Volume 2 is pretty cool."
1,Yuk,"If this was uncut and has a subtitle version, it will be worth getting, but it doesn't. Just a poorly dubbed and massively cutted version of a great anime series. Very Disappointing"
3,Not bad for the price,"Although some people may be disappointed in the hard plastic, for the price, you're not going to find anything better."
3,Excellent reference if you have Sony DVW 700 or DVW 790 cam,"This is for professionals who are seaking to transition from film to digital cinematography. A very large part of this book would be most helpful if you have a Sony DVW 700 or DVW 790 digicam, since the menu items for each of these cameras are covered in depth.Clearly Mr. Wheeler knows his stuff, having been in professional film making for many years.You must have a pretty good technical foundation to understand this book. For example, you should know the difference between a gaffer and a grip!If you're looking to take videos of the school christmas program this is NOT the book you're looking for."
2,Too expensive for a litle book.,"What a crazy price for a puny little book. I'll keep it for possible future use, even though it is only about one-half of an inch thick. I will say, however, that the distributor got the book(s) to me very quickly in the standard shipping mode."
5,Beautiful book,"I bought this book used on eBay. When I saw the cover, I knew I had to have it. First of all, there are plenty of how-to photos in color, explaining how to paper piece. It can be difficult to learn how to paper piece, but once you learn, it's like riding a bike ... you don't forget. But it does take time to figure it out. There are 36 quilt blocks, one per page. I love the author's use of color for her blocks. It really makes it look like stained glass. There are more pieces to piece because every black line is another addition. I'm anxious to put together a block or maybe a small wallhanging with four blocks."
4,Simple how-to-dos,"Well worth money spent, this booklet highlights simply some basic techniques how to bead basic bracelets. I got insprired to try some new methods with success. The instructions are detailed and the basic methods are also described in the beginning, not only as part of a special piece of jewellery.Models go easily to variate, thus, the booklet will be a good reference for future projects, too."
4,Nice and Easy,A good book for beginning bead weavers. Any of the designs are quite wearable and instructions are easy to follow. This book is from Bead&Button Magazines and a good value.
5,excellent,i enjoyed this book very much. it's filled with lots of great projects and the directions are clear.
3,"Okay, but not great","This is a very thin volume, so I suppose I shouldn't be too terribly critical, especially given its low price. Nonetheless, after purchasing and using so many of the projects in the companion volumne ""Easy Beaded Chains"" I admit I was somewhat disappointed with this one. Still and all it's not a waste of time or money--it's just a personal preference sort of thing."
5,The presentations skills workshop,"I have taught presentation skills for 25 years and have read many books on the topic. This one is an exceptional, hands-on guide for trainers that follows a powerful model. I rank this among the top 2 or 3 such books I have ever used. Excellent guide. Highly recommended to anyone teaching or coaching presenters or public speakers."
5,A wonderful resource!,"This book is perfect! Now I feel incredibly confident about preparing and delivering a training class on presentations. Dr. Bienvenu left nothing out. It's succinct, focused, and complete."
1,Amazed at the reviews received,"I am amazed that reviewers have awarded 5 stars to this book. Personally I found it quite mundane, plus not organised. Why, for example should the worksheet for evaluation appear two times - on pages 124-125 and again 175-176? To fill pages? For me, finding any useful stuff was a pain and also futile. If anyone is interested in getting help on teaching Presentation Skills get yourself 2 McGraw Hill Titles - 1) Presentation Skills Training, 30 High involvement Training Designs by Wendy Denham & Elizabeth Sansom and 2) Presentation Skills - The McGraw-Hill one Day Workshop by Phil Lowe."
2,Too Basic -- Will work only for the inexperienced,"If you are going to be teaching a workshop on this subject for any but the most inexperienced group, look elsewhere. Although well-intentioned, this material will work only for a novice audience, one which has never given too much thought to presentations or meeting management. The ""communications skill model"" -- around which this book is based -- is self-evident and signals that the reader will be directing his or her workshop to an unsophisticated audience. Actually, I am not even sure this stuff will work for ANY audience. It is just too simplistic. You likely already know what is being presented here -- and that to my mind is not good news."
3,Good but somewhat disorganized,"This is a good (not great) basic resource if you are a trainer that trains others to make presentations. However, as a personal training tool, it's limited. There is some interesting info. at the end concerning the differences in learning between genders.My biggest complaint with this book is it's organization. It took me several ""thumb throughs"" to understand how it was organized (no, I'm not slow!)."
3,New Chapter Headache Take Care,"I have headaches daily. If my headache is not real bad, this product does work. I also take a prescription medicine to attack nthe migraines."
2,Oh well.,"So, its been about 3 weeks since I got this product & I have to admit, there has been no change in me at all. I continue to go when I have to go, stop when I stop & there is no extra boost of anything. The product is not a cure all & does not feel like a vitamin. In fact, I don't feel anything at all. Perhaps this is a placebo or something. Nevertheless, the ingredients can be found in most health food stores or places like GNC. They promise wonders but really don't deliver. NOt to mention, this product is not reviewed by the FDA and is not designed to treat, diagnose or cure any diseases such as issues with the prostate. Snake oil? Perhaps.Update- It is now 11/1/09 & there has not been any change whatsoever. I don't have more energy, my schedule is still the same, nothing has changed or improved. I guess the only plus is that I am not worse off after using this product for the alotted time."
3,"Well, it didn't hurt me...","Having completed one 30-day supply of this dietary supplement, I appear to be none the worse nor none the better for it. To continue with another supply would require blind faith in the untested and unproven efficacy of this product. Taking these daily with a glass of trust and a big grain of salt, the only noticeable result was an increased ambivalence regarding the product's effectiveness. One cynically wonders whether its mix of ingredients was concocted by marketers, not physicians, and was engineered to meet demographic need rather than to extend scientific finding."
2,Did not work for me,"I use one full bottle and I could not tell one bit of a diffrence. I have also tryed other prostate ""cures"". None have worked. I will go to Dr and get a perscription."
4,PSA numbers low.,I have been using Prostate 5XL in combination with other daily vitamins for about two years. My PSA numbers have been very low and holding. Must be helping.
3,Not sure!,"After many months, I really don't see any appreciable difference. I am going to decrease and then cease my use before I make a final decision on whether it has been helping."
3,"Noticeable benefit, but no rave review.","So far, so good. Noticeable benefit within 2 weeks. I can say that it is helping, just no rave reviews coming from me. Maybe 35% to 40% improvement. I take two per day religiously (morning and night) and have for about 2 months.I also think it is helping with my forearm tendinitis. The mixture seems to decrease other body inflammation? I am doing other things for my forearms so I cannot give full credit to these pills for that.If I keep feeling better and better over time (in the prostate), my rating will likely improve.I recommend that you give these pills a shot if you have had prostate pain or urine flow issues. I am somewhat pleased and notice some benefit."
3,"Good ingredients, but too expensive","These pills contain a lot of things that are beneficial in theory, but one should be skeptical of supplements, especially at this price. Quite simply, these pills are priced like a miracle drug, and they're not."
5,helpful,"well, since I am a girl, I gave these to my hubby who is just starting to have a little prostate problem, waking up at night etc. He was fully checked by his doctor and the doc said it's just normal aging.I ask himt to try these and after taking the whole bottle, he said he actually feels like it helped him.He isn't waking up at night every single night. It's not completely gone but he said it is better.Also, he said they are very very easy to take. He does not like big pills and he also has some stomach issues and he said these did not repeat on him. Those were little problems he had with other brands.He actually asked me to buy these for him and I am currently trying to find them in a store. I think I will just order them from Amazon. You can't beat the customer service here either.Now, I don't know if this has anything to do with the softgels but my husband also said he finds himself with a little more energy."
5,Product that works,"This is a super product that actually works, for a very reasonable price.The product does what it claims.Manufacturer has been very trustworthy, using the finest quality ingredients. You will be able to tell a difference!"
2,May Ease Certain Prostate-Related Urination Problems in Older Men,"A month of consuming these gel-caps has produced a modest but not dramatic difference. For whose who want to relieve the problem without resorting to prescription drugs, this may be a cost-effective and adequate solution."
5,Works Great!,This is the 2nd bottle I purchased...I noticed a big difference within just a few days. No getting up 3 or 4 times a day or having to pull over to a fast food place to use the restroom. A good price too...a few dollars cheaper than another online vendor.
1,Complete Waste of Money,"I'm 57 and for the past couple of years have noticed the common problems related to an aging prostate. They aren't severe, but rather subtle and typical, so I thought I would try something like Prostate 5LX. After all, just check out these outstanding reviews! Aside from now being out some coin, I can't tell any differnce in any area whatsoever. Maybe I'm just getting old and nothing will make me 30 again but this stuff didn't make any differnce whatsoever."
1,No difference,"Hoping for some relief from frequent bathroom trips. Didn't want to take pills from my doctor. Saw the favorable reviews and thought I would try something more ""Natural"". No difference what so ever, total waste of money."
1,not happy,"please don't pay attention to the images attached when ordering this product. this is not for the main grille on your vehicle. this is for the little lower grill across the bottom.ordered this for a gift for my husband. Fast shipping - thank you Amazon but when it arrived it is for the lower grille, not the main grille as pictured."
5,Just Lovely,"It works exactly how it's supposed to, I've had no issues whatsoever. Not to mention 1GB is a pretty good deal to get with two converters. I'm quite pleased with it."
3,good book!,i really enjoy this book! its in good condition and it didnt take too long for shipping.thank you!
1,poor packaging guarantees damage during shipping,"Poor packaging at the Tensen Factory guarantees that the table will be damaged during shipping. We returned our first table because the edge of the table's top looked like someone had taken a hammer to it in several places. When we requested through Amazon that they improve the packaging and ship a replacement, they merely added two bands around the outside of the box, and the same type of damage occurred to the second table. With a little bit of padding around the table during the initial packing, this problem could be avoided.The table would be beautiful if undamaged."
4,Pain-Free for the Shakespeare-Averse,"I'm homeschooling an 8th grader; this series makes Shakespeare accessible and even entertaining for my student. We read the ""No Fear"" translation together, read/compare the more important speeches in the original language, and then watch the same scene from a cinematic version. I highly recommend this for ""a little touch of Harry in the night"" that is painless and fun."
3,Easy to understand,No Fear is good for those new to Shakespeare. I normally prefer Folger's Shakespeare but this edition was less expensive to I thougth I'd give it a go. It was good but I still prefer Folger's for everyday reading.
4,"More of the same, and I mean that in a good way","Eisler continues to push the pace in this series, although it lags a little with the introduction of two characters to the storyline that play critical roles in the books to come. Both characters are likeable enough though the big-lug-affable-loud-gregarious American sniper seems a little ham-fisted at times. No one talks like that all the time, but these books are meant to entertain. The author apparently takes pains to be accurate in terms of geography and the vibe of the locale, so as a reader I can forgive a little stereotype when he tries to expand the character's universe a little.The bottom line is if you liked the first two books you will eat this one up and look for number 4."
4,"nice thriller, very reminicent of James Bond","I picked this book up on a whim, not having read anything from the author before. Some ways in I realized that this was not the first in the series, so there is a lot of ""history"" behind it I was not aware of, but I was able to make sense of it and enjoy it just the same.I've read all of the James Bond books (from Fleming, Benson, and Gardner) and this book reminds me a lot of those. That is not a criticism though, in fact, I consider this to be a great find for me. I am looking forward to the rest of Barry Eisler's John Rain books for sure."
3,Contract Killer to Superhero,"In 'Rain Storm', John Rain completes his transformation from amoral hitman to reluctant hero. Pressed into action, his victims are all certifiably BAD and in the final sequence he, albeit unknowingly, saves the Planet (or, at least, Israel). We don't even have to worry about collateral damage; civilians are reassuringly absent and only those who stick out their necks get them broken or throttled.#3 provides a change of scenery, but whereas the travel guides which #s 1 & 2 doubled as were clearly labours of love, the setting descriptions this time sometimes feel just a little bit laboured.However, whilst now a more conventional thriller, Rain still makes for an entertaining read, and I look forward to my next long haul flight so I can make full use of #4."
4,Another Fine John Rain Adventure,"The series continues to keep its momentum--""Rain Storm"" felt like a natural continuation of the first two books, not like John Rain was being dragged back for more adventures. The change in location from Tokyo to Macau helped keep the story fresh, as did the introduction of sexy Delilah. Although, naming a character Delilah was strange. Nobody would name their daughter after a famed seductress and betrayer.John Rain provides fast action and adrenaline for the reader through a mostly likeable assasin character, and I hope future books by Eisler will be of the same quality. I would recommend this series--starting with ""Rain Fall""--as an enjoyable break from slightly less exciting every day life."
3,more RAIN,"i was not impressed with this installation of Rain it was too much of his last books, what was new was not exciting. it seems like we went backwards and covered same information"
3,Travel guide?,This was a good story however the pace was slow because of what I considered a lot of unnecessary descriptive detail. At times it sounded like a travel guide.
4,A fun escapist novel,"A friend loaned me this book and I read it in a flash while I was on vacation. Loaded with action, plus good plot twists, and of course a romance, this is a great book to take you away from all the day to day problems. Now I am planning on reading all the others in this series. I am always looking for another good series of books and now I have found one."
3,Pretty good,"I am not certain. This is the first I have read of his novels and I just could not really get into it. I found it interesting but that was about it. i did give it a fairly good rating as it was but I guess I am more into the Patterson, Sanford, W.E.B. Griffin type of story. I love the sniper background to any book and this had it. I guess I would try one more."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I have never read a book by Barry Eisler before Rain Storm. I was pleasantly surprised. The writing was notably better than most in the genre. The main character was interesting and multi-dimensional. Usually, I skip over fight scene verbiage because I can't make heads or tails of it. Eisler's action scenes were lucid and generally helped to move the story along. I plan to read more of Eisler's books in the future."
1,Not worth it,"Glad I didnt actually buy this book, was able to find it in a local library.. This book continues the theme of the majority of raw food books out there, backed up with little data or proof of what they claim. Instead you are advised to ""eat what your body craves"" or some other useless advice. Most of the raw foodists I have been around look very gaunt and unhealthily thin like they would blow away in the wind, always claiming its detox, its detox! ""I will gain more weight when the detox is over.."", what a bunch of nonsense.. ***This author also published a magazine ""Just Eat an Apple"" which you can still in fact subscribe to today, what the website doesnt tell you is that the magazine folded up about 2 months ago, but he will still gladly take your $$. Be warned.."
2,Have to separate the wheat from the chaff,"This is another personal opinion type book. The lack of scientific support for blanket statement is pervasive. For example, the author categorized people into two camps; those who thrive on low-fat, carbohydrate base diet and those are better off with more fat and less carbohydrates. While there is a grain of truth in this depending on how active a person is at any moment or in what season of the year(i.e. summer is hot so fat consumption is not useful), general statements can be misleading and certainly not useful.There are no secrets in ""The Raw Secrets: ...."" The information is publicly available in numerous web sites, in more positive perspectives."
5,Helpful advice for the raw fooder looking to improve diet,"I found the advice and information in this book very helpful in terms of improving the quality of my raw diet. There are certain pitfalls that new raw fooders tend to get trapped in, which slow down their road to health. Patenaude's clear, concise recommendations on how to improve the diet as well as how to avoid making common mistakes has helped me to make smarter food choices.Although I found that this book is more for an advanced raw fooder, the appendix contains a chart for transitional foods and replacements. There are also many testimonials from raw fooders who changed the way they ate, experiencing tremendous health and healing.I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to refine and improve their diet."
5,Delivers what it promises!,"If you are struggling with a raw vegan diet, or are just getting started and want to save yourself a world of problems, this book is a wonderful asset. After 6 months as a raw foodist, I had not experienced ""Paradise Health"" and was wondering why my progress had stagnated. This book pointed out the pitfalls I had fallen into, and reminded me to go back to basic health (natural hygeine) principles and use my own intuition. Concise, practical, and inspirational, this book was truly a godsend. Just a word of advice - the book assumes that you already know most of the rationale behind raw food diets, etc., so if you are new to raw veganism I would supplement your reading list with less targeted material. Thank you Frederic for your insights, and for the courage and integrity to point out the lessons that you have learned since you first started writing on the subject."
5,one of my favorite,"one of my favorite books about health, nutrition and rawfood diet. In my opinion, if you are serious about health, you should read at least one natural hygiene book. This book adoped a natural hygiene approach to explain how to achieve viberate health.It will answer many of the questions you have if you have doubts about rawfood. If you are a starter of the rawfood diet, it will help put you on the right track and clear your confusion of what is the right way of doing raw. I wish I have read this book when I first started. Now it is one of the very few books I would recommend to friends who want to get the most out of a rawfood diet."
5,"Rational, reasonable, and probably right","Frederic Patenaude has a patent understanding of the principles of Natural Hygiene, and perhaps more importantly, is able to convey these ideas in an understandable manner. Having read many of the author's previous pieces, I see this book as indicative of Mr. Patenaude's deepening understanding of human nutrition and sense of self as a writer. Beyond the lucidity of Mr. Patenaude's arguments, the book stands apart from many other books on raw foods because of its coherent editorial structure and logical progression of ideas."
5,not only for dieting,"bhThis book is a way of looking at all aspects of life, not only diet. As a matter of fact it has no menus or recipes in it. I rarely read books twice, but this one is worthy of a second read. A small book with big life-lessons."
5,I LOVE this book!,"Though alot of these ideas may not be new, they are very well constructed and sometimes it felt like I was hearing these simple profound revelations for the first time. I also appreciated the extensive research and felt I could totally trust his wise insights. I know if I am able to implement all of his suggestions, I WILL change my life for the better!"
5,Highly Recommend,This book is life-changing and extremely empowering. It brings you back to the core of who you really are. It awakens your consciousness and reconnects your mind and soul with your body so that true and complete healing happens.
5,Amazing Book,What a fantastic book! It gave me a whole new perspective on my relationship with food. I'm learning about developing new eating habits for health and wellness. Bravo!
5,Rock Your World,"If you've been dieting and reading articles about dieting and body image for as long as I have, you will most likely find this book refreshing and enlightening. It emphasizes points about weight and food that are rarely addressed and he does a good job of explaining how to implement his ideas. Buy it!!"
5,Required reading,"Common sense, practical, life changing , this book should be required reading for every breathing soul. It's like I found the missing handbook for the care and use of humans!"
2,save your money,"After reading all the pages it comes down to one thing, EAT SLOWLY, Chew More ! Would not recommend as there is nothing to be gained"
2,"It works great, But.......","I bought the OMRON 670IT Blood Pressure with the idea of taking my blood pressure in the morning and evening then downloading the data and printing it for my doctor to see.However, the software only works on Microsoft XP and 2000. I have an Apple Computer and a Dell with VISTA.So the ""Data Management Software"" doesn't work for me. I regret spending money for something that I can't use."
2,Wrist PB monitors still not accurate,Omron HEM-670IT blood pressure monitor. My older Omron cuff type monitor needed the cuff replaced due to age. I was told by several people that the newer wrist type monitors had come a long way and were very accurate so I ordered the Hem-670IT. It is very convenient to use VS cuff type but after a week of use we found that the readings were consistently too low by 5 to ten points especially on the systolic reading. Needless to say I sent it back and ordered the Microlife BP3MCI-PC which is the cuff type and highly rated by Consumer Reports for it's accuracy.
2,Had to return for refund,"Worked for ten days although the readings seemed consistantly low, then would not pump up with any pressure and showed E error message. Changed batteries and still not working. Seems defective - Returned for refund."
1,Omron HEM-670IT Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor with APS (Advanced Positioning Sensor) and Advanced Omron Health Management Softwar,I am happy for those of you that this unit works for. I mainly chose this one because of the software. I was not able to ever get the readings downloaded and spent numerous hours with Omron technical support. I made 4 different calls back to Omron's technical people after gathering their requested information from both Dell and Microsoft. The software still wouldn't work and they said 'sorry' return it! So that is what I am doing.
2,HEM 670IT BP Monitor,"Sad to say this does not appear to have been a good purchase - It wirks fine, I bought it to allow me to measure my BP at work. I own an Omron 790 and wanted to use the same software to keep records.So why a poor purchase - well, My BP is typically 150/100 My Omnron 790 measures it at that and has done for a year, My Dr measures it at that and has dsone for 18 months. The 760 seems to think my BP is anywhere between 118/76 and 130/ 95. It VERY rarely gets anywhere near the truth!I'd love to think the 760 is right, but the evidence is stacked against it - so, for an out of the box product that is supposedly calibrated this gets a HUGE thumbs down"
5,bp cuff,This product is very easy to use. I like it much better than arm automatic blood pressure cuffs.
4,nice machine-but a lot of technical data not needed for every day use,"I have been a SICU Rn for several years before I retired in 1999. This new wrist BP machine works very well but I do not use the multiple settings needed to average the vital sign readings. After disabling the sensor before the reading starts, I liked the rapid BP reading after one activation of the on button. I use the machine every day for myself and my husband. I do think the covering for the wrist section will break down rapidly as it is very thin material on the underside and rubs against the skin with every use. You might want to use a stronger covering at this pressure point. However, I still say this is a great machine and easy to use."
4,"Very nice product, except..........","This wrist monitor works well and is pretty accurate. One problem - I can't get the advanced positioning sensor (APS) to work. You are supposed to place the unit on your wrist, then hold it near your heart and it is supposed to pick up your heart rate and ensure an accurate BP reading. I can't make it happen. My friend, who is an RN, can't make it happen either. We can't get it in the right position for the APS to work. If the unit is set so that it does not use the APS, it works fine. So if you don't want the APS, your money would be better spent on a unit without it."
3,Omron HEN -670IT,"Nice product, Only major issue was product in not compatible wirh Windows 7. I could not install the OMRON Health Management software."
3,Reads very low,"The Omron wrist blood pressure monitor is very easy to use. I like the fact that you just put it around your wrist and push one button. The pressure on your wrist is nothing compared to an arm monitor. Much much less. So if you find normal arm monitors uncomfortable, this one will be great for you. Cons: The reading is usually low by a few numbers. My normal is 122/70. With the wrist it reads 113/65. I have tested it against an arm and the doctor's office. Still a good product."
3,Needs many batteries,I love the ease and convience of this b/p machine. The only draw back is that it runs through batteries every 3-4 days. I am wondering if it is defective or normal.
4,Software Problem,"I really like the product but I'm having a problem with the software program on my laptop. When I try to see the graph screen I receive the following error message ""The procdedure entry point ?GetDIMSValue@@QAEHXZ could not be located in the dynamic link library dlbtutil.dll"". I called customer support and they offered no solution. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and get the same message. They suggest I call Microsoft but as everyone knows they will only provide help for money. This software works on my desktop. It gives acceptable accuratre reading. I would buy the product again."
2,Does everything it says it does!! WARNING but not on Windows 7,"I bought my monitor from Amazon in June 2008. To ensure it was providing the correct readings, I took it with me to doctor's office. Readings were on the money. My doctor loves the printouts I take him every six months. Two and a half years of use and no problems. It doesn't miss a beat (no pun intended!)!MARCH 2011 WARNING: The Management Software for HEM-670IT is NOT compatible with WINDOWS 7. Just purchased a new computer and could NOT load the software. A search @ MicroSoft indicated driver was not available. NOTE: there is a newer model that is compatible. MY PROBLEM?? - My monitor is still working GREAT!!"
1,"Doesn't work. Get the arm cuff model, that does work!!","I received Inconsistant readings so I Asked about the wrist models at the local pharmacy. They told me they were not accurate, so I sent mine back to Amazon and bought an arm cuff automatic model. This style is Very accurate(for me) and I am very pleased with it."
4,GOOD ITEM.,ITEM DOES WHAT IT STATED!IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE INSTRUCTIONS.IT COULD BE MORE USER FRENDLY.
1,Dose not work!,Omron HEM-670IT Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor with APS (Advanced Positioning Sensor) and Advanced Omron Health Management SoftwareDoes not match to readings taken by three nurses at different Doctor's office. Ranged anywhere from 20 to 30 points low. Product is useless to me.
1,I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED...,"I returned a Walgreen's wrist blood pressure monitor for $59.99 because it was not easy to see the readout and not even close to being accurate. I bought the ASIN:B000Y86CMS Omron HEM-670IT Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor with APS (Advanced Positioning Sensor) and Advanced Omron Health Management Software)for nearly $30 more, thinking the price would indicate quality. It did not!! This wrist cuff doesn't work any better than the cheapest ones. I knew it would not be as accurate as an upper arm cuff, but being off by 70+ points is not acceptable."
2,Mac not supported,"I already have a much simpler version of the Omron monitor, I really wanted this one for some of the advanced diagnostic and recording features. However, the software is Windows only! This is not made clear in the product description, except for one mention of PC ... when selling anything with software the production description needs to spell out the computer requirements ... a big miss. That being said, the functionality of the monitor is good, but I paid extra to get the software and diagnostic features, which I can't use on my Mac. Very disappointed."
5,"So far, So good","I work at a desk all day and didn't want a full arm BP cuff. The unit is easy to put on and needs only 1 button to work. It has built in alarms to remind me to take my BP, which I like.With the software, it is easy to track my BP and print out a report for my Dr.Aside from being easy to use, convenient and accurate, it arrived overnight!! I bought mine from Heart Rate Monitors USA and only paid for standard shipping.So Far, I am very happy."
1,Worst ever,I must say i did a lot of research before buying this and thought it would be good i have 2 other but they are for your arm this one has not had right reading on me or my wife since we got it what a pice of junk.
4,"Easy to use, does what what we want.","We purchased this monitor to be able to quickly and conveniently monitor blood pressure. It is very easy to use, appears to be accurate, and just does the job.The positioning sensor makes sure you have the unit in the proper position for the reading.I didn't rate this a 5 only because there was nothing really outstanding about the product. It does the job, plain and simple."
5,Very Accurate BP Monitor!,"This monitor is very accurate,and for the past month has been within 5 points of my doctors mercury blood pressure monitor. The only drawback: it cannot store independent data for two persons,which may be ideal for couples. The hand positioning sensor is also a great addition that improves the accuracy of the readings.I would highly recommend this monitor to anyone."
3,manual doesn't explain everything,"Ademonstration video would be a big help.One picture is worth a thousand words.Once you get the hang of it, it works quite well."
5,Wonderful!,This Omron wrist blood pressure monitor is just perfect. It is easy to use and easy to read the numbers. The one drawback is the display itself. The background color for the black print could be a bit brighter or lighter to make it more easily readable. It works like a charm and is so much easier than the other regular models. I do not mind having to monitor my BP now.
5,Doctors were amazed at printed Data I brought from my last appointment,"Small, transports well in provided case. Doctors check the calibration to the office unit they had. If you take just a little time setup work great. Easy to use and the Accucheck function is a fine choice."
2,Not very accurate sadly,"This little product had great potential, but the readings were not accurate to my actual bp. Had to return it."
1,WRIST BLOOD CUFF,"I was very disappointed, it did not give accurate results. We tried it on several people with known HBP and the results were way off (LOW). Gave it another chance at the md's and again reading was way off. Wrapped it up and sent it back."
4,Omron Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor with APS,"Calibrated with my doctor's office, this wrist monitor is extremely accurate. I love that it has a desktop interface to monitor and house your history and pressure readings.The travel case and price is also a nice feature."
2,Valuable Health Aid,"I learned much about how to better control my blood pressure without medication.I would recommend it to anyone, gladly."
2,Not happy with the readings.,"This wrist unit does not give accurate readings. I wanted something easy and quick to monitor my blood pressure but found this unit only would work while I was laying down, and the readings where significantly lower than my actual blood pressure. as compared to the doctors reading. It read much lower."
3,These are OK,"I probably did something wrong, but my cupcakes runneth over, so they didn't come out as pumpkins. I cut the top off and flipped them over so they would sit flat. I ended up with baby pumpkins. They also did not cook well either. Again, it could have been me. Not sure, but I probably won't use them again. It was difficult using 8 different molds. I am going to buy a pan that has all the molds in a single pan."
1,"Beautiful Songs and Great Artistry, Terrible SOUNDING Boxset","This is by far one of the most terribly ""re-mastered"" reissue sets I've ever heard. A great talent such as Nina Simone deserves far better treatment. Thin on low end and shrill (even distorted!) in the midrange, this box set is wretched sounding considering the technology and fine mastering houses that are available out there. Unfortunately, there are a glut of bad ones out there, so my advice is to stick with the big labels who have the capital to do justice to the material."
1,Charly should be ashamed of this,"I'm no sound queen but the fidelity of this compliation is atrocious: vinyl crackle, cymbal rides that sound like tape hiss, compression problems, fuzzy at low volume, distorted at high volume, etc., etc. I've listened to lots of music on lots of formats and there are some fidelity issues on here I can't even identify. Not only would I avoid this release, I would avoid ALL of the Charly black box three CD compilations. Moreover, the liner notes are worthless, with no reference to source, year, musicians, etc."
2,"Too long, too wordy, not worth the effort","Not sure why the author who does make some good points, couldn't find a way to express those without trying to sound important. The writing style got between his message (which was interesting) and his delivery. I finished it, got some value, but in comparison to other authors, this was a letdown."
2,Boring,"I haven't finished the book yet, but so far it is boring and full of semantics and long video game descriptions. I would not recommend it."
2,not fun.,"assigned this book for class and not having a good time reading it. have no interest in the subject whatsoever, book is over-repetitive and redundant. get to the point! i agree that learning should be active though, but this book could be a lot shorter."
2,I bought it for my class,"This is one of many required books for my class on Applied Simulation.I did not like the book. I thought the author was a ""windbag"".If you must buy it get a used version.A better book to read is definitely Jared Diamond's "" Guns, Germs and Steel"" Excellent!and""Hamlet on the Holodeck: The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace""by Janet H. Murray"
4,Correct,"I received the book in time, it was slightly damaged on the corners. But it's not a big deal :)"
3,Ambitious attempt,"The book is well worth a read but for researchers/academics within games and learning it lacks references to important research. Still the book has interesting discussions and draw on educational theory that is well used.The book seemed a bit weak to me in the sense that a lot of the principles apply to all areas of human life, and is not as such a special property of computer games. Also it shines through that the author likes certain game genres (adventure, RPG, action)."
2,"Facts in spots are wrong, brings up credibility issue","I bought this book with high hopes, being a teacher, and an avid video game player. When I got the book, I immediately turned to the chapter which talked about Everquest (having played Everquest since its beginning until late last year). Imagine my surprise when I found an extreme amount of errors in how he describes things that happen in the game. For example, he says that when a player dies, the corpse drops to the ground spilling all the objects it was carrying and the player comes back in a weaker form with worse armor. This never happened even in the early stages of Everquest. Besides, the publication date is 2003 regardless.That was one such example of many I can cite from that chapter, but that brings up credibility issues for me in reading any further in the book. If that chapter's facts are wrong, then how do I know that other facts in other chapters are correct?"
4,Satisfied customer,"The dress was very pretty and met my expectations. It fitted well. However, it would have been ideal if there was a matching pants."
3,looks nice but doesn't seem to be the same quality as others,"We ordered 3 different dresses for my niece. This one seemed to be made a little more cheaply than others, even in the same price range. We ended up keeping this one:Exquisite All Satin & Lace Christening Baptism Gown -[...]"
2,"Beautiful, but not entirely practical","This dress was very beautiful, however if I could do it again I would have bought a nice cotton dress. The material was scratchy, and my baby was very slippery when she wore this. I was very worried when the minister took her from me that he might not be as careful as I was and drop her, because she was so slippery. Luckily there were no mishaps, but I changed her out of this dress as soon as the baptism was over."
1,"trying to be clever, and isn't","I wish I would have looked at this book in an actual store instead of pre-ordering it on Amazon. It's pretty bad. I'm wondering too if it isn't a reprint of a book from the 70's. If someone gave me frosted sugar cubes, I'd have to rethink the friendship. Particularly hard to stomach, though, is the corny humor. But then, why am I buying a book for Dummies in the first place? Maybe that's why I didn't like it, I'm not an idiot."
2,Rack Sack,Not pleased with this product. Very well made but much too narrow. Have to order and use their small bags. Our original Rack Sack could hold grocery store bags. This is a poor design that cannot be retrofitted
3,"Evaluation of ""Rack Sack"" purchased at Amazon.com","The RackSack item purchased does the job we needed it to do, but it replaces one of the same name that we had for years that was twice as large. I recall no dimensions listed on Amazon, and there were no other models to purchase. So now we have to empty the contents to the outdoor trash barrel twice as often -- a distinct inconvenience."
5,Glad to find this,We have purchased a summer (smaller) home and it doesnot have a garbage disposal. I need something handle near the sink to separate the paper from the garbage. This fits the bill.
3,Annoying,"I returned this item because there were no instructions and the pieces wouldn't stay together. It was also not the size I ordered, though it (the one I THOUGHT I was ordering) was advertised as a ""kitchen"" system. The best I could tell, it wouldn't have fit on the door of the cabinet under my sink anyway - the lid looked cumbersome and too big - too much trouble to have to open if you have a handful of trash while cooking, etc."
2,Quincy Jones-50 Years in Music,"Not what I expected. Never seen Quincy Jones perform before and that is why I bought the DVD. But I was not very happy with the music dished out.His voice at times was inaudible. The picture and sound quality was good but not the type of music I Like. This is my personal opinion. For people who like strictly Jazz, this DVD would be good."
2,My anticipation to the more!,My anticipation to the more what DVD that acquired but hopes in future to acquire more from your products
3,"Too short,,,,,,!!","I bought this tape and was disapointed cause it's just too short, why release it , i don't get it,They did have some rare footage of the Manson family, the girls with shaven heads and with short hair smiling and smirking to the cameras, there is a small video clips from an old interview with Van Houten from when she was a free woman (during her second trial) and Tex's parole hearing, b&w; crime csene fotos and Sandra Good making threats ""Los Angeles will burn to the ground""Each show is 15 minutes, don't waste your time."
4,Very Inspirational. A very good read.,Very inspirational. A very good read. Provides a great foundation for positive thinking and transitioning for the better.
1,Non-shipper - beware of this seller,"Difficult to review the book because I paid for it (not much, admittedly), but I never received it. Amazon blamed the seller. Seller blamed the PO; said these things take time, y'know. Heh heh. Two months. No book. Caveat Emptor."
1,Mr. Collins writes falsehoods....,"Here's what crazy, CNN, MSNBC, and FOX do not do the news. They just yell all the time. The only losers are the American People, who just want news, not cheap entertainment that is barely far ahead of the Roman Gladiator Games."
4,News Junkies won't be able to out it down.,"I am not an avid reader. I read books here and there. But never, never, have I bought a book and read it ALL in one day. I received this book today from Amazon at around 6pm. By 12:30 that night I read the last page. What a fantastic story. While Roger Ailes is the main focus of this boo, the author has a difficult time staying on track. He'll bring up a interesting story and then seem to go on a tangent before wrapping it up nicely at the end. While the cover of the book toutes this as how Fox beat CNN, it's more of how CNN lost it's crown. Interesting stories include Paula Zahn's exit and Greta Van Sustren's arrival. Over all quite a read for any cable news junkie. I admit I am a loyal Fox Fan, but it's still quite a take on the corporate news world's cutthroat business."
4,A breezy book about the cable TV media wars,"This is the story of how Roger Ailes outsmarted lots of folks to take Fox News to the top of the cable TV news business. It is also the story of how MSNBC never has been able to gain traction as a result of poor leadership and many mistakes (such as spending millions to set up a Dononhue show that was doomed to fail from the start). This book also tells the story of how Rick Kaplan badly damaged both ABC (Food Lion Special) and CNN (Valley of Death Special). The sad news of late is Kaplan is now president of MSNBC--like Peter Arnett he keeps showing up like a bad penny. I gave the book four stars because too many issues are covered superficially, because the author is too critical of Tom Johnson (a thoroughly decent person and a fine print and TV journalist) and because he fails to give proper credit to three individuals who were largely responsible for CNN's excellent coverage of the Gulf War of 1991, Ed Turner, Bob Furnad and Judy Milestone."
4,"Dishonost Name, But An Interesting Read","In ""Crazy Like A FOX"" author Scott Collins apparently was capitalizing on the popularity of the Fox New Channel to sell a book about the collapse of the network newscasts, along with the rise and fall of CNN and MSNBC.Along the way, Collins throws in some tidbits about FOX News' techniques in overpowering these news giants. But like most liberal writers, he fails to grasp the real reason for FOX's popularity: The majority of American citizens, regardless of party affiliation, are conservative and have an innate sense of fairness. These values have bled over into their news-watching habits after the FNC simply offered them an alternative.With all that said however, I rated this book a 4-star. Mr. Collins guides the reader, in a logical and well-paced narrative, through the back alleys of the cable news business, the powerful characters involved, and the steps and missteps of the players on this world stage. Well worth your reading time."
5,Interesting,"This book was interesting. It brought up many behind-the-scenes things that you rarely see or read about. Best of all, it was done without a lot of flair or exaggeration (too many books lately are swinging for the fences with how they can make things larger than life). The author remains fairly objective and writes in a style that is informative and easy to read. Put it on your list."
2,A little disappointing,"I was really hoping for more out of this vac. My 12-year old Hoover had finally died and looked at everything on Amazon to find a nice, mid-priced vacuum.On the plus side, the motor is more than adequate to pick up dirt and the bagless feature is a big plus. The HEPA filters are positioned for easy access with a reminder for how often they should be changed. All good stuff.On the downside... The carpet height adjustment dial is nearly useless -- it's a little piece of plastic that's supposed to push up on the vacuum head to give it more lift, but it doesn't really work. Fortunately for me, it handles my carpets at the ""default"" setting.Another disappointment is that there's no way to turn off the rotating brush. This is a giant pain when I go from carpet to tile. And, the floor brush (sold separately) doesn't work nearly as well -- it tends to push the dirt rather than picking it up."
1,Flimsy...squishes the pet.,I opened this item and packed it back up within 30 seconds. It's very hard to get your pet in it. I have a 4 pound dog and collapses on him. It doesn't stay in the form of a bag that you can put something in. It just closes in on itself. No thankyou!
5,Love That Forest,The Sounds of Nature: Pine ForestI love the forest & this cd is lovely. When I can't make it to the woods I can put on this cd & enjoy the fresh ambience of nature. It's great!
1,pretty sweet,"The Minotaur is a pretty sweet awsome action figure, it's really realistic. it has a weapon slashing action and removable shoulder pads. I like it."
1,Won't Run on Win XP,"I had problems getting this to run on my Win XP machine. Contacted support they said ""Please note, version 8.1 is over 10 years old and has trouble running on XP (it will not run on Vista)"". They then offered me a 10$ discount toward the purchase of the $49.95 Version 10 available on their website."
2,Not a good first line tool,"I read some of the reviews before purchasing this $5 program. I understand that you get what you pay for, but none of the reviews prepared me for what I would receive. The application seems to assume you already know the correct spelling of the words. On lesson 1, you're taught hello, goodbye, etc. What you are not given is the correct spelling while in the lesson. Compare this to the $400 Rosetta Stone application, and you see that it is necessary for a newbie to the language to be able to see what it is they're repeating. I have both Rosetta Stone and this application. I'll stick with RS as it is far more intuitive while still acknowledging that level one users need to be able to read and write as well as speak the language. I would use this program to refresh my memory, maybe on words that I'm already familiar with."
3,"Takes to long/Thought headset was included, but wasnt",You took longer then the anticipated time and i thought a head set was included.
2,A stretch. . . (pardon the pun),"I've enjoyed all of Gail Sher's books on writing for their clarity and truth, but her lastest is just a bit too much. It almost seems as though she has said all that she can possibly say about the way to approach writing so now she writes a book about Yoga and writing. Ugh. Just seems so gimmicky, not real, a bit ""out there"" for the sake of sounding like a wise guru and possibly just an excuse to write another book. There are so many other books an aspiring writer can read in order to enlighten themselves on how to make words ""come alive."" This , definitely isn't one of them."
5,Battat Take Apart Airplane,"First gift opened by our three year old and we could have gone without any others! He absolutely loves it. The put together aspect becomes obvious after a couple of tries, the ""power screwdriver"" is the favorite part. To me this is like a 3D puzzle and it has kept our little guy busy for most of the past three days. I highly recommend this toy."
5,Josh's favorite toy!,"Re: Battat Take Apart Airplans -- Our almost three-year-old grandson got this for St. Nicholas and he loves it. He has always enjoyed watching his ""opa"" work on items in our homes and always tries to help. (Yes, Opa lets him help...Josh holds the screwdriver or the flashlight.) This toy is right up his alley and he is learning the different drill bits. Very useful for the future! You cannot start kids like Josh too early. It is in their blood!"
4,"Great toy, drill replaced","Based on the reviews, we got this toy knowing the drill may be a problem. We got the airplane and the crane and one of the drills didn't work. Once we got in touch with someone at Battat, they sent a new one and our 3-year-old daughters love playing with the toys."
5,Love it!,"We started with the Battat airplane and then added the crane to our collection. The working drill with all the screws and bolts and washers makes my son feel just like daddy. The chunky size makes everything easy to maneuver. Nice and colorful. Just hard enough to put together to be fun and challenging, but easy enough that it doesn't take too long and is very satisfying when done. Excellent purchase for the money."
5,Great product! I'm buying others!,"This was by far the best gift that we purchased for our son Christmas 1 1/2 ago. He was only 2 1/2 when he got it so it was a little hard for him to hold the pieces while he drilled, so we helped him put it together and he loved doing it. Now, we have two boys (2 & 4)that play with it and they both love it! The airplane is very sturdy. They only problem I found is that if you tighten the screws too much, they sometimes get stuck. I have to get them loosened before they screwdriver takes them out, but it only happens once in a while. Even with that we've been very pleased! I highly recommend it! I am just about to purchase the truck and car. I have no doubt that my sons will love them."
4,Must spend extra $25 to get another drill motor that works ...,"I agree with other reviewers. The included drill motor (circa 2011) is a lesson in frustration for my child, when trying to take the toy apart.The drill motor does not have enough power, even using normal alkaline batteries, which have a higher voltage than rechargeable batteries. Beware of using rechargeable batteries, because their slightly lower voltage will lower the power output of the already very weak drill.Expect to spend about $25 more to buy the drill motor found in another toy, which works with this toy. See other reviewers for details.For a more powerful, compatible drill motor, see:Educational Insights Design and Drill Activity Center"
2,The one bolt keeps falling off,"In the words of our 3.5 year old son, ""Something's wrong with it"". The bolt that holds onto the grapple doesn't tolerate manipulation very well and keeps falling out. We have the battat airplane and that is awesome. This one, a disappointment."
5,What a unique toy!,"Purchased this for our son's second birthday last month. Fell in love with the concept of being able to deconstruct a vehicle bolt by bolt using a toy drill. There are so many construction sets and building blocks available on the market, but I have yet to see a toy like this. It's essentially a 3-D puzzle that truly challenges the child's mind. And when you're done putting it back together, you can play with it like regular toy airplane. The only downside is the fact that the drill is a bit weak. Though I've noticed that it works just fine after having to hand-loosen the bolts for the very first time. Only use the drill that's included to loosen and tighten the bolts and there should never be an issue. I plan on purchasing the crane very soon!"
2,Toy is not worth buying,"My son received this as a gift for Christmas. The battery powered drill works sometimes but when it is working it is not very powerful. It couldn't even unscrew anything on the toy. So I had to loosen every one of them, and by that time my son got bored as well as I was. A very frustating toy, but the concept is good. It just couldn't deliver."
5,3 year old loves it,I got this item as a gift for my 3 year old nephew. It is a little tricky for him to build the whole thing himself but he loves the toy. he is figuring it out quickly.I would defiantly recommend this item for any little one who is good at figuring things out or likes to build stuff.
2,"not as good as it looks,","This toy is not bad, but it is not as good as it looks in the pictures. the quality is ok, but it is not much fun; at least for my baby,,,,"
4,Well-built toy,Good value. Toy was durable & easy to work with. 8 yr. old played more w/ it than 4 yr old
3,"Fun, but not functional","I got this for my 3 year old son and he does enjoy playing with it. However, the drill isn't strong enough to unscrew the parts. It puts them in fine, but you have to use your hand to loosen each screw before you can use the drill to fully unscrew it."
3,"Great idea, needs better drill","My son and his cousin both received this for Christmas. They both loved it, except for some reason the drill can put the screws in yet lacks the power to take them out without hand loostening. They both ended up using the drill from the ""design and drill"" that my son also has - it's much more durable and powerful enough to remove and insert the screws."
2,Disappointed,"I bought the Airplane and Crane July 2012. The drill was as others had said. We tried 2 sets of batteries. We have to push start the drill. Meaning turn it on, squeeze the trigger and use finger to get the bit going. Once it is started, it will stay started but don't let go of the trigger. I found the instructions complicated. I expected something more kid friendly. The crane box was completely missing instructions so we haven't put it together yet. It is a great idea. Unfortunately with the drill drama my son kept saying ""This is taking too long. I don't want to do it anymore. Can you take it back?"" He is 4 so factor that in."
2,Disappointed!,So disapointed in this toy. Drill lacks the power to tighten or un-tighten screws - even with help (finger tightening and loosening) the driver still could not perform. Drill bits fell off the end of the driver as we tried to activate the drill. Grandson very sad. Mechanically adept son and husband thought the toy was a good idea and would teach great skills IF IT WORKED! RETURNED THE TOY.
2,not without help,"What a great idea - theoretically. My boy 3.5 of age really likes the electric screwdriver. But it screws the screws in so tight without effort, that the reverse gear doesn't actually unscrew them without help by an adult. Also it is not one screw per part. You need to help the child to figure out that the top wing needs the wheels inserted at the bottom at the same time to actually make it work. I love the concept, but it isn't something that translates to fun play. Maybe the other car/crane is different in assembly, but the plane certainly isn't our favourite toy. Puzzles or lego seem to work better for 'problem solving/logical thinking' learning. Shame, because it is a really cute toy:("
2,"Great Toy, But...","My three year old just received this toy for Christmas 2011. It is a beautiful toy, and very well made. My problem is with the design of this toy. It is touted as a take apart toy, but it is nearly impossible for little hands to put it back together. I could barely figure it out myself. See that screw on the blue wing nearest the propeller? That screw goes through that wing, through the body of the plane, and must be attached to the stacked wing and wheel assembly. That's coordination of five separate pieces (the screw, 2 wings, the plane body, and the wheels! A bit ridiculous to expect of a toddler. I gave it to my seven year old and he did it with difficulty. It's a great idea, and very well made, but the design just falls short. Looking for a gift to frustrate a toddler? Buy this one."
4,The drill is what the boys REALLY loved.,"The accompanying drill that comes with this airplane is what my boys (2 and 5) really enjoyed. My older son loved to screw/unscrew the airplane parts, while my younger lad liked to try and drill his own teeth out with the drill. I think all of the slobber is what caused the drill to stop working eventually. It might just need to dry out? As far as my opinion goes, it's a nice toy. Interesting and fun and pretty well made. B-"
1,Definitiely no power in this drill!,"We were just wrapping this for Christmas, removing all the protective wrapping so my son can play with it as soon as he opens it. We put the batteries (not included)in the drill and tried it out. The drill worked fine until we tried to actually use it on a screw. It didn't have enough power in either direction. We tried another set of batteries with the same results. Very disappointing, but at least we found out before our son on Christmas morning!"
2,Cheap and overpriced,We put it together once before the pieces started breaking..... the drill died 3 months after purchase. so i was dissapointed.
5,"Great purchase, my son loves it!","We first saw this toy at an Aviation Muesum, my son couldn't put it down. I'm so glad I found it at Amazon!"
2,Would not recommend,Not worth the money. My grandson was bored after putting the plane together once and taking it apart. The plane should be no more than $20.
5,Great toy for age 2,"My grandson -age 2, loves screwdrivers and helping Daddy and Grandpa. This toy was a nice challenge and allows him to safely play with a screwdriver and build his own toy."
3,Better options available.,We received this toy after seeing a neighbors CAT Take-apart toy and let me say our friend's toy is of much better quality. The shiny plastic that they chose to make this toy of means that the all the screws come loose on their own. I have to tighten them if we want them to stay and then my son can't undo it on his own. The CAT toy is made of a matte plastic so the screws stay on even when not tightened all the way making it a truly fun (not frustrating) toy to play with.This toy is great in theory but I recommend spending the extra few bucks and buy the CAT take-apart toys. I plan on donating this toy and upgrading to the CAT this Christmas.
1,Don't misplace the parts,"My son loves this toy, but he misplaced one of the nuts and bolts. I contacted the company and they do not sell replacement parts. This toy was supposed to supply years of fun but is now worthless. I would not recommend it due to the Battat's poor customer service."
5,Battat Take Apart Airplane,"We gave this to one of our grandchildren as part of his Christmas gifts. He loves it and we enjoyed playing with it, and helping him to see how to do it."
5,Three year old grandson loves this airplane!,"Our grandson received this for his third birthday, and initially needed a little help. We visited a month later and he is able to take it apart and mostly put it together by himself. There is a possibility of losing some parts, but they are fairly large, so will probably not be lost forever."
5,Be careful not to lose any parts,"This is a great toy! My 3-year-old son loves it, and can put it together himself, with very little adult help. The only problem is that it comes with no extra parts, so if you lose one of the small screws, you can't put the crane together. Another reviewer said that she had lost a small part and called the company, who sent her a replacement free of charge. I just tried the same, but was told that they moved their manufacturing plant to China, and now have no replacement parts. So, if you lose a small part, you can no longer build the crane, unless you want to buy a second toy to use as replacement parts."
3,Not as good as it looks,"4 yr old got this for his birthday. IT seemed like a neat idea. But the quality is a bit cheap. It ain't going to break or anything, but it's cheap shiny plastic and doesn't hold together really well.INcluded drill is kind of cheesy. Doesn't screw things together tight enough.Also can't rearrange anything. It would be a better toy if you could build another design or two or change it around.Also a bit tedious to put together the thing. The way some of the parts go together is a bit clumsy especially for a 4 yr old. The body has to clip on a strange way to the cab. The crane has some quirks to how it goes together.And again doesn't seem like it stays together really well to be used as a toy.Great idea. So-so execution."
2,Screw driver arrived broken,My 3 year old son just opened this toy for Hanukah. He is really excited but the screw driver that came with it does not work. This takes way from all the fun of putting it together.
1,Worst doesn't work,This is the worst product. I read bad reviews but still wanted to try it. The screw driver works only one way.
3,Driver problems - too weak and/or bad gears,"My son got this for Christmas. It's a great idea, but the power driver is troublesome. It is too weak (not enough torque) and often needs adjustment to get it driving again (bad gears?). Perhaps we got one with a bad driver. If it had a good power driver, then I'd say this toy is worth 4 or 5 stars... but with the problematic driver, I'm giving it 3 stars."
4,Strong Interest & Weak Power Tool,"Child a bit under three years old. Instant and lasting interest in plane. Power tool weak on extracting bolts. Biplane well constructed, durable, and parts fit well together. Recommended toy. Enjoy playing with it myself and I was born when Roosevelt was President. (FDR not TR!)"
5,Bought it for a friend,"My son had this toy a year ago. Our neighbor friend would come over and the first thing he went to play with was this take apart plane. Then, we gave it to him for his birthday when he turned three. This is a sturdy toy. It is interactive. It is a great learning toy for hand manipulation. It has nice colors and I would recommend."
5,Good development toy,"We gave this to a 3 year old boy. It was the most interesting toy at the party. All the kids at the party wanted to play with this. They assembled and disassembled several times. It is good for building finger dexterity, sequencing, and general mechanical know how. This is a great unique toy."
4,Great toy but So Many Loseable Pieces!,"We love this toy. The concept is great. The drill really ""works"" and has a couple bits that fit the various nuts and bolts that hold the crane together. It's easy for little hands to work. But it is very easy to lose the pieces. It doesn't sound like a lot when you read the box but 34 pieces is A LOT for this kind of toy and EVERY ONE is important. That's the downside. Within about half an hour of getting this home we somehow lost a couple bolts and it wasn't like we were in a frenzy. We were very organized in our play but I do have a 4 year old and a 2 year old so you can only be so organized. It hasn't fit together perfectly since. We have been able to fudge it, and it's still very fun, but it's not the same and very frustrating to not be able to complete it. (I think more for me than them, like I said we've been able to fudge it.) I wish it came with extra bolts. You know, like how real mechanics always have spare parts. ;-)"
4,Good gift for Older Child with Fine Motor Deficits,"My 10 year old boy isn't a ""builder""; no legos, etc. He has cognitive delays as well as mild Cerebral Palsy. But this toy was just the right level of difficulty for him to succeed and feel good. It's not 'baby-ish'. But it would be nice for a typical small child. Children can play with it after putting it together, and can take it apart again."
5,Toddler following big brother's passion,Our toddler idolizes his 11 year old brother from a passion for the garbage man to mimicing airplane sounds. This plane is a great 'puzzle' toy for the younger one to use while brother plays with his die-cast set. Both were enthralled with the operational drill. Fantastic.
4,Battat Airplane,I wasn't sure what to expect after reading some of the reviews. I was pleasantly surprised.I bought them for my grandchildren ages three and four. They enjoyed them very much. They could handle the screwdriver and all the parts with very little assistance. I would buy them again.
3,Poor quality,"My kid loves it, but it is also very frustrating for him. First of all, one of the drill bits broke. I called Battat, and apparently there is no way to get a replacement. Second, the nuts don't stay on tightly, so I have to keep tightening them for my son to keep the truck from falling apart. I'm still giving it 3 stars because my kid loves it despite these drawbacks, but if I could go back, I would buy a different brand."
4,almost perfect,"I saw this on a mommy blog & decided to purchase it for my 4 1/2 year old son for Christmas. It is an excellent toy. Even my 2 1/2 year old daughter loves it. The drill & little drill bits are a perfect size for their hands, & they now know the correct names for the bits & bolts. We've had hours of play with it already.The only downside to this toy is that it comes with exactly enough nuts & bolts to put the truck together, but of course my kids have lost one of the nuts. The truck is still fun, but we can no longer attach the crane part of the truck. I wish it came with a few extra pieces for the inevitable time when your kids lose some of the pieces. I'm going to see if I can get extra pieces from Battat directly. Also, it would be nice if the box was big enough to fit the truck when it's put together.Overall, one of the best toys my kids have. They love it & I do too."
3,Battat Take Apart Airplane,I have twin 4 year olds and they liked it at first and it was exciting. Played w/ the first couple of days but now that they know how to put together they have put to side and have not played w/ for a couple of weeks. Good for teaching them skills such as taking apart and putting back together but like I said once they learn how it's not that exciting.
2,Power brush is useless,"I owned the predecessor to this model, which was exactly the same except it did not have the ""power brush"". It was excellent for hardwood and vinyl floors where no brush is needed. Unfortunately, after five years of weekly use, the wheels broke. So I purchased this model as a replacement, because the original model was no longer available.The ""power brush"" is useless. It gets clogged with hair and fibers then blocks the sucking when being used on hard surfaces. It is not very effective on any carpet. It's a prime example of a stick vac trying to play with the uprights.Anyone interested in a stick vac should buy a stick vac, and anyone needing an upright should buy an upright. Don't confuse the two!I wish Bissell would market a unit more like my original one."
1,Don't Spend the Money!!,"This book provides only a brief overview of the Manson case, which is where the book went wrong to begin with, as the Manson case is too complex to be adequately covered in 90 pages. Definitely not worth the price! Readers would be better served to devote their time to longer, more in depth reads on this subject. Avid Manson enthusiasts will only be angered by this book as the large font and small number of pages suggest that this topic is not worth more detail."
4,Introspective,"What starts out as a coming-of-age young adult novel turns into a life-changing love story that leaves the reader with more questions than it answers. Michelle Tea writes an excellent book that uncovers a wide-range of female characters and psychologies that explore a world seemingly against them.Tea also examines the effects of class differences, yet veils her more serious themes with an entertaining plot and fast-moving story. Just when the story seems to become predictable, a new twist takes the characters in new directions.Rose of No Man's Land takes a simple casts of people and explores their unique perspectives, forming a novel that turns itself into an introspective, yet entertaining, reading experience."
4,the right stuff,I love Herb Ritts. Also Richard Avedon is on the top of my list. I bought both for my birthday and have no regrets. This is top notich photography and both are beautifully produced.
5,Pure Art,"Herb Ritts has a very special gift when it comes to photography! Every photograph ranging from supermodels to movie stars to rock stars are elegent, sexy, and beautiful! Herb Ritts really knows what elegence is, and there is no doubt that he is THE fashion/celebrity photographer of the century. I'm so impressed by his work in both photography and music video! A must have!"
5,Nice ring with great service,"This product is nice, the ring is beautifully finished with no so bling bling look, I was looking for something which is elegant yet have some gold touch in it and browsed almost 1000 rings before I settled on this one, what even more nice was , that this seller sent me shipment overnight fedex as I requesetd to have this ring asap, and they sure did, they replied my emails promptly and very curteous,highly recommend them for purchase."
1,Don't bother...,"I bought these for our garage and a front entry. All they've done is ATTRACT insects so far. Should have taken a picture, but we had a small web above our's (actually attached to the product) with about a dozen baby spiders running around. I've noticed we have as many spiders and 'rolly pollies' as ever. Now, whether it works for the mice (and I was hoping bats), I still do not know, but it definitely does NOT repel insects of any kind."
3,"Commentary, not a breviary","Hi, This book is not a breviary or book of liturgy. It contains commentary on the divine office, instructions on praying the divine office and other essays. It actually does not have the liturgy in it. You can piece together the psalms and canticles from the commentary, but there's no hymns or other parts of the Hour. You need a book of liturgy to use this book. I'm not sure how good the commentaries are, I haven't read them yet. They may be quite good, but you still need another book to pray the Divine Office."
1,Not what I expected,"Needed the ""Litury of the Hours"" to use with my ""Idiots"" book (on how to pray the hours)... thought this was it but it wasn't a good match."
5,"Polydactyl kitties in a polydactyl paradise or ""purradise""","This book showed a nice variety of polydactyl kitties in a polydactyl cat paradise or ""purradise."" It has also the stories of the cats from their ""purrspective."" Was thinking the Hemingway House should have actually UPDATED this book every couple of years to show some of the newer cats who went on to succeed some of the other kitties who had since passed away or died, hopefully in most cases from OLD AGE."
2,an almost non-existent plot ruins everything,"What more can I say? Some people like this kind of plotless novels but I personally don't. No more of this, please! A redeeming factor is the amusing characters in the story though I wouldn't recommend you read it just for that. Read it only if you are familiar with this author's writing style."
3,Not too enjoyable...,"There isn't really any plot in this book. It juz drags on and on and makes u want to sleep. It mainly evolves around a Briton, Cockie Milton and her love life or should i say love lives. It speaks about Ben and Eva, her roommates' love lives too. Pretty boring i would say, unless you find Annalisa's provacative character intriguing."
5,Best Sunblock Moisturizer,"I've used this product almost every day for two years, and I just love it. 10 minutes after putting it on, you don't even realize its there because it's light and nongreasy. I don't have sensitive skin, but I will only use this sunblock on my face, since it never makes me feel sticky and gross."
1,Smelled like sunscreen on me,"I bought this product because I need fragrance free/odorless due to allergies and asthma. After applying the first time, I had to wash my face immediately. Smelled just like sunscreen and made my eyes itch. I returned it to the store for a refund. I do not recommend if you are looking for ODORLESS sunscreen."
2,Very white!,"This did the job of moisturizing, but it left a white wash across my face no matter how hard I tried to blend it into my skin. I looked like a ghost! :( Tried to make the most of it by using it as body sunscreen for the beach, but it became runny white streaks when I got wet. Do NOT buy if you are even slightly tanned!"
4,Like it very much,I was Hesitating because wasn't sure how I'm going to like it. I have a hard time with moisturizer due to sensitive and acne prone oily skin. It did not turn out too bad. I think I can make it work since I needoisturizer and SPF or retinol use daily at nite. It's good product. If u r trying out products this will be the one to try before going high brands
1,Dried out my skin,"I had been using Eucerin Skin Renewal Lotion for about 3 years whenit suddenly became unavailable. I tried this lotion and started having flaky, dry skin immediately."
5,Pearl in the shell,"The infamous attack on Pearl Harbor like the Titanic disaster are infamouse little incidents in history that fascinate me.I came across a copy of this book while going through a used bookstore that had recently opened. More of a scouting mission than any actuall interest in finding books. And I am glad I did go thre. I found this book. It is well illustrated and nicely written, makes a good addition to any library for this interested in this event.I am actually amazed I didn't buy this book when it first came out as I have numerous books on the subject."
3,Our Call to Arms in 1941.,"What do you expect from a Life book. Great pictures and that is what this book delivers. Unlike other books dealing with Pearl Harbor, this Life book examines the conditions in both the U.S. and Japan, then goes in detail about the attack, and then shows some of the personal glimpses of some of the participants sixty years later. This book excels in both its photos and personal portrayals of people.There are some flaws in this book. An experienced person can pick them out quite easily. For instance, it talks about the battleship Shaw blowing up, well the Shaw was a destroyer. It also details the invasion of Belgium and Netherlands, and states the invasion of France was later, both invasions occurred at the same time. There were other mistakes, so hopefully this does not confuse the beginning historian.This book was a OK read, and the pictures are great."
2,Almost does the job,Bought this to replace a dead Radio Shack switch which was a 4 input 2 output device with learning IR (uses any remote control). I correctly figured that the auto-sensing inputs would be a fine replacement over the learning remote feature of my previous switch. It's nice that this device doesn't introduce yet another remote control into my house like other products in this price range. S-Video out only displayed black-and-white on my HDTV for some reason. Composite video worked fine.
4,A good one,"I bought this on an impulse after seeing their video for ""Ha Ha Ha Song"" on AZN, and I'm glad I did. It's good, it's fun, and it looks great in your CD case. The singer's got a great voice, and the music is good. There's a variety of songs here, from kind of happy Asian pop-rock have your friends saying ""What the hell are you listening to?"" sort of songs (Ha Ha Ha Song), so some fairly dark, heavy ones (I saw him), to what I can only assume to be quiet ballads where the girl just sings, using the said great voice (171771).Admittedly, I have absolutely no idea what any of the songs are about, save ""Silicon Belly"", which is pretty obvious as the chorus is in English, but the rest...nothing. But it's fun, and I'm glad I bought it."
4,Promising debut of a fun female sleuth,"Five stars for atmosphere -- I've never been to Baltimore but Lippman provides a terrific sense of the place in this her debut novel. Tess Monaghan is a native of the city and gives many wonderful insights as she unravels the mystery of who killed a prominent attorney.Four stars for characters -- Tess is a delight. She has much of the humor of Davidson's Goldy, Evanovich's Stephanie Plum or Grafton's Kinsey Milhone. I look forward to getting to know her better in further episodes. The supporting cast is very interesting also, particularly Tess' aunt Kitty who runs a feminist cum childrens bookstore.Three stars for plot-- this one takes a while to get rolling. The final 100 pages are very promising. It took me awhile to sort everything out. A very good first effort."
4,A very enjoyable start of a series,"Since I loved WHAT THE DEAD KNOW from this author, I decided to try her Tess series. This was a really good start. It has interesting characters and the premise was interesting. I look forward to reading more of the Tess books and getting to know more about the different characters."
4,Really liked it...,"I have to admit, I have had a copy of Baltimore Blues for years, I kept trying to get into it and couldn't. Well, once again I picked it up and couldn't put it down. It is a well written mystery, I love Tess, hope she stays independent and keeps her unique characteristics. I am now reading the 3rd in the series and haven't found it a problem with reading out of order. Although you really should read the 1st one at least. I intend to read all of the Tess series a new favorite for me."
1,"I love Laura Lippman, but...","This was her worst book ever. It was a giant pile of BORINGNESS. I like Laura's stand alone books, but I will never again read a Tess Monaghan novel."
2,A bad beginning for a bad series; thoroughly messed up heroine,"I didn't like the irrelevant bits about marijuana, her messed up relationship with Jonathon or her stupidity when it came to Rock, but the mystery was interesting.Note:Charm City: A Tess Monaghan Novelwas absolutely horrendous; therefore, knowing Lippman doesn't improve I wouldn't pick this one up either. What I had hoped was just a rough start to a good series turned out to be a bad beginning for a bad series, so don't waste your time with this one either."
3,A Good Initial Start,"This is the first in a series featuring Tess Monaghan from Baltimore. I enjoyed the story line, however, became bored @ times with too many characters. The plot seemed disjointed at times. However, I will read additional books by Ms. Lippman!"
1,A Letdown for Rowers,"I read about one novel per decade. I picked up this one, having heard that it has characters who are rowers. (I myself row.) I was astonished, however, to encounter on page 10 a passage in which two rowers are in singles and one reaches out to touch the other. This is simply impossible to do! In fact, because of the way the oars and riggers stick out, it is impossible for two boats, side by side, to be more than eight feet from each other, and even then, there would be danger of capsizing one or both boats in subsequently separating them. Conclusion: the author, who has made her main character a rower, knows next to nothing about rowing! She has thus violated the cardinal rule of Creative Writing 101: write what you know about. I stopped reading.This won't, I realize, be an issue for non-rowers, but rowers who seek a novel about rowing would be well advised to look elsewhere!"
4,an excellent first mystery novel,"This book is well written - the characterizations are original, the description of Baltimore is interesting but not overdone, and the ""whodunit"" ending is suprising but believable. I agree with the reader who said it took the plot a bit of time to really get rolling, but considering this is both a first novel and the first in the series, this slight flaw is easily excusable. I've already started on book 2, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Tess to fans of Kinsey Milhone and Stephanie Plum."
4,An introduction,"This is a great introduction to what promises to be a great series. Tess Monahan is an ex-reporter who was dumped from her job when the newspaper she was working for went under and she was made redundant. For two years she has struggled to make ends meet by working part time at her aunts' book shop, scratching at the irritation of her boredom by rowing, her exercise of choice. Her rowing buddy, Rock, asks her to follow his girl friend Ava, who is behaving strangely, and to find out whether or not she is seeing someone else. Ava has several meetings with notorious lawyer, Michael Abramowich and when the lawyer is murdered, the blame falls immediately on Rock. Tess now begins to raelise her true vocation and future livelihood is that of being an investigator for a legal firm, and embarks on an involved course of action to clear Rocks' name. There's plenty of action and many twists and turns in this novel and, of course, I can't wait to get the next in the series."
4,GREAT FIRST EFFORT,"I am new to the Tess Monaghan series and the first book is BALTIMORE BLUES. I enjoyed it very much. Tess Monaghan an out of work newpaper woman is dragged in to investigate a friends arrest. In effect she becomes a private eye. I enjoyed the story, the great humor in the book and what I hope will be reoccuring characters in the books to come. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
4,"Ex-Baltimore reporter,Tess Monaghan, solves strange murder","Baltimore lives in the capable hands of this author. Another in her fine series about a budding P.I. with a host of well-limned, quirky, friends and family, and ex racing greyhound, Esskay. Hired to shadow the fiancee of a friend, Tess decides to manipulate the outcome and thereby meddles where more experienced wouldn't tread. Pandemonium and murder result. Fun, interesting and well worth the price."
5,Dee Dee,Excellent grill. Love it. Rotisserie works splendidly. Worth every penny! Grill starter still works after 6 years as long as u cover the grill while not I'm use
5,Great debut from one of the best new singers,"David Kersh has gotta be one of the best singers to come out in a while. He's got it all on this, his first album. The songs are great and his voice is nothing short of awesome! This is one of my favorite driving albums! I'd suggest you pick up the debut from one of country's hottest up and comers to see what I'm talkin' about!"
2,Weird,Ok so so this story was really weird and I love it was crazy I mean with that chicken in all !?
3,OKAY,iT WAS A LITTLE SKIMPY BUT IT WAS COLORFUL AND A SATISFACTORY BOOK FOR BEGINNERS. WOULD PROBABLY LOOK A BIT MORE FOR SOMETHING ELSE NEXT TIME
5,Fantastic first book for my preschooler to read herself,"This is the first book (ever) that my 4.5 year old read. She had been showing interest in reading, knows her letters and letter sounds so I got this book. Voila! Twenty minutes later with much prompting and encouragement she sounded out all the words in this book. My only objection is to the word ""one"" which is tricky for a first timer."
5,Young Children can memorize it,Just before my son's 4th birthday I read Big Egg to him and he memorized it and read it back to me. It will always be a special book in our family.
4,Another polished and intriguing story,"P.J. Tracy (the pseudonymous identity of a mother-daughter writing team) wrote one of the best debut mysteries of 2003, the Gumshoe Award-winning Monkeewrench. Now she has written a sequel, Live Bait, and it is another polished and intriguing story.Like John Sandford, the superb crime writer whose work hers most resembles, Tracy uses the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul as the setting for her stories. That frigid Midwestern location makes a perfect backdrop for her suspenseful and witty stories of cops and killers.Several elderly people in the city have been the victims of violent attacks, and the pressure on the police to solve the crimes is intense.Live Bait has a complex and interesting plot, and the lead characters are nicely done. Unfortunately the secondary characters who were used to such great effect in Monkeewrench hardly appear in this one, but that is only a minor detraction.Reviewed by David Montgomery, Chicago Sun-Times"
4,"Solid, entertaining - Read series in order","WARNING: If you plan on reading other books in the series, do not make the same mistake I did -- read them in order. This one contains ""spoilers"" for Monkey Wrench.The characters are entertaining, and help get the reader wrapped in the story quickly. I found myself trying to get a few pages her and there, every chance I got. The spoilers are too bad -- other series writers are more careful not to do that, and looking back, it was not necessary to the plot."
2,Sophomore slump!!!,"I read their first book, Monkeewrench, and liked it enough to buy this one. Not a strong effort at all,where do I begin...Well its not a good sign if the detectives do absolutely nothing to solve the main mystery, instead we get them running around town complaining about the lack of AC in their car; the heavy lifting is done by one of the software geeks. Bad guys? Transparently obvious. For the 'Wrench crew, instead of characterization, we read what everybody wears. The detectives get fleshed out a little better but not much. Action scenes? Not really. The plot? A recycled one that we all have read/seen about 1,000 times by now. My question is when do we stop using Nazis as the bad guys in our books/movies? 2010? 2020? Its been done!"
2,"""Live Bait and Switch""?(2 and a half stars)","Book 2 in the 'Monkeewrench' series is, ultimately, disappointing, especially if you're looking for more of Grace and company. Their brief apperances in the book only serve to clue in the otherwise-lost Maagozzi and Rolseth.""Live Bait"" suffers from a very unoriginal premise, and, once again, too many characters. At times, it feels like it was written as a standalone story, then the authors decided to squeeze in the characters from 'Monkeewrench' to try to strengthen it. Unfortunately, even they can't make this book more memorable. The best parts, once again, are Grace's scenes with Magozzi. There's also a promising hint of things to come in book 3, ""Dead Run"". With any luck, focusing on Grace and the team, and getting out of Minneapolis for a little while, will give this series the 'reboot' it needs!"
3,Eventually an Engrossing Mystery,"Live Bait, like Monkeewrench, took me about 5 chapters to get drawn into the story. To me, someone killing off the elderly is just sick & you'd have to be pretty off your rocker to do it. Case not very interesting and case closed. Another psycho killer. Let's move on. But I persisted in reading and it did hook me. There is more to the story than a psycho killer killing elderly for no reason. And it involves more elderly people and their families and Nazis, of all things. Because of the Nazi angle, the story was disturbing. And it touches on some deeper questions of what makes right and redemption and forgiveness. There isn't much more light shed on main characters - the Monkeewrench crew, Leo Magozzi or Gino Rolseth - but the writers give you a lot of background about the other main characters that are introduced.It was an exciting mystery with a surprising conclusion, but not an excellent, 5-star mystery."
4,Doesn't Quite Live Up To The Promise Of The First,"I was a big fan of Monkeewrench, & as soon as I read it, I rushed out to get this one. I like it, but it's no Monkeewrench. The storyline's not bad, but it kind of lacks luster. There is a fair share of sudden twists and turns, and the action moves at a quick pace. Having said that, the characters are what prevented Monkeewrench from becoming run-of-the-mill in mystery territory. The likeable characters of Gino & Magozzi are back, and so is the Monkeewrench crew. Unfortunately, the members of the Monkeewrench group that kept the first book lively only pop up occasionally this time, and the novel suffers for it. Still, the duo of P.J. Tracy have a knack for dialogue, and their books are fast-paced reads. Live Bait doesn't live up to its expectations, but it's a fun way to kill an afternoon."
4,More Murder & Mayhem in Minneapolis,"Just in time for opening of Fishing Season in Minnesota came this new book from the mothers of Monkeewrench, the mother/daughter team of P.J. and Tracy Lambert (pseudonym P.J. Tracy - get it?) So if fishing is slow, one can read this snappy (no Piking here) story of post Holocaust horrors. It's a taut, well-characterized tale, somewhat reminiscent of Ed McBain's 87th Precinct police procedurals - with all their side stories. The reader even rides along Up North, out of Minneapolis, back to Brainerd for those of you who haven't had the pleasure since the movie *Fargo,* but since then they took the Paul Bunyan Statue and his nostalgic amusement park paradise and put up a parking lot :-( Reviewed by TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer."
5,Fun series,Enjoyable. Got hooked after the first of the series monkeewrench. Looking forward to additional books to this series. Enjoy the books
4,i like these monkeewrench folk,"this is a fun storyline. for a murder mystery, that is. this mother and daughter team make a pretty fun writing duo. there's a fast paced intensity that keeps you turning pages to see what happens next. the characters are engaging and you find yourself truly connected to the outcome of the mystery they are embroiled in."
1,Just kill me please!,"This was the worst movie I've seen since ""Boy Eats Booger"" on America's Funniest Videos.. The acting, effects, and all production values were strictly high-school media class. When I used to play with my friends and shot one with my pointed finger, I got better acting. I suffered through almost 10 minutes of this film and deleted it. The audio sounded like the little mic on your pocket-cam.I could have bought a small latte with that 1.99 and had much more enjoyment."
4,Gorgeous moments,"I have only heard the Summer Tale portion, which is where the 4-star rating comes in rather than a 5-star. I heard it for the first time ever last week. I was drawn in by the haunting beauty of the duet by what must be english horns. And continued to be in awe of the gorgeous moments interspersed in this piece. Parts are typical 20th century-sounding stuff that I normally don't like, but then Suk drops in these absolutely gorgeous and melodious themes that are riveting and compelling. A big YES to this piece! Try it, you'll like it!"
5,Truform 20-30 Thigh High Open- Toe with beaded Top,These hose are wonderful! They are so comfortable and they really help with tired and aching legs! The price of these are so reasonable compared to other places who want $75.00 or more!! Thank you for offering a great product!!
4,Perhaps irreverent...,"I made a hollow book hiding place for a flask out of this book, and gave it to my Dad, and AutoCAD administrator, for Christmas. It was a big hit. Highly recommend it. One caution: I thought I was ordering a hardback, and they sent me a paperback, so just be careful."
5,Highly entertaining,"Nofziger is not the hilarious donnybrook that Ed Rollins' book covering the same eras is, but it's more circumspect, more low-key, and less emotional. But it's emotional enough, and it's occasionally very funny too. Especially valuable is the inside information on Reagan's unsuccessful 1976 run. Like Rollins, Nofziger believes that Reagan's executive style of management (i.e. knowing his place) was a great strength, but his remoteness and inattention to detail also led to the appointment of the people (Baker in particular) who undermined his conservative philosophy and shunted his key advisers (e.g. Meese). This directly led to the ineffective second term and the Bush years. Thus the ""revolution"" was largely DOA. Nofziger is one of the good guys in politics. Honest and not self-aggrandizing. If only there were more of him in Washington. He maintains a site out at lynnofziger.com."
4,Very nice new game,"Wow im impressed with the level of detail these guys at bobgoat included in what is, as far as I can tell, their first published game. The setting is really dead on, it leave a hell of a lot of freedom for an experienced GM but includes enough to set up a new game without too much stress. The real kicker is the obvious effort theyve put into creating an effective and simple rules system. In the world of d20s huge influence its nice to see a game system that just makes the whole thing easy."
2,Surrender Cinema's getting too tame,"Although the production values are up to Surrender's usual glossy standards, the sex scenes are so stylized (and so unrealistic) that they are totally uninvolving. Also, they're simply not as hot as in earlier Surrender films like ""Femalien"" and ""Virtual Encounters"", especially the girl-girl scene. In this film, it's more of an exotic dance than anything else.A final note -- the star, Shauna O'Brien, has unfortunately gone the implant route. Her natural body was a knockout (see the original ""Friend of the Family""), but now she looks preposterous. Too bad!"
3,Surrender Cinema meets Zorro!,"Surrender Cinema. Talk about a flash in the pan! They came out of nowhere, made some incredibly hot soft-core films and then vanished, after only a few short years. ""Zorrita"" was one of their last films. You can probably figure out the plot: beautiful young woman decides to put on the mask (and take off her clothes at numerous times) of Zorrita, to fight the forces of evil in old-time California. I thought it was fun of Surrender Cinema to take a jab at the superheroine genre. I wish they had done more. SPOILERS: Not much fighting or sword-play. Plenty of nudity and simulated-sex. You won't find it on DVD unless get someone to make a copy from VHS. But the VHS copes are very cheap. Almost as much a rental!"
4,Good product,"A good product, but taking 3 full tables (large) every day is not the most convenient. I would highly suggest the Every Man's One Daily alternative--one pill a day and you are done!"
2,I wanted to like these,"I really wanted to like these vitamins. I think they are probably very high quality but my body just didn't like them. They gave me headaches and made my hands shaky. Your mileage may vary. Wish I had bought a smaller bottle to try first, I got the 120 count!"
4,A Real Good Vitamin For Men,"This vitamin is really good. No after taste -- no stomach problems after taking it, and a real good foundation vitamin for a man."
2,Not the best-especially for the price,"I always purchase my vitamins through Amazon and have tried a wide variety. Compared to other brands of vitamins, New Chapter Every Man Multivitamin definitely lacks in potency and substance. These vitamins don't give me any energy whatsoever. If you are the type of person who doesn't want to take ""horse sized"" vitamins, then I guess this is the vitamin for you. They are smaller vitamins compared to other brands. (You take two of these vitamins daily). For the price, I can purchase 2 bottles of the Rainbow-Light vitamins I use now. Comparing the ingredients in the New Chapter Every Man Multivitamin to my Rainbow-Light Organic men's vitamin, the New Chapter comes up short in many aspects. (I have to take 4 of my Rainbow-Light Organic men's a day, so some people may not want to deal with that). Look at other brands. Just because a product is more expensive than another doesn't mean it's a better product. This definitely applies to vitamins."
1,"warning, these guys just sold out to proctor and gamble, April 4, 2012","just a sharing of information. I have been taking these pills for a little while and really liked them. Then I found out they were recently sold to P&G;, which is an awful company with a terrible track record of buying companies and changing their products with cheaper ingredients. This no longer is a safe supplement, imo.Just another example of the corporate elite trying to control of food sources and health."
2,Too strong.,Turns out that the problem wasn't the old struts it was the supper stiff hatch glass hinges. I oiled the hinges and replaced the old struts for like new function. The strut to glass attachment is the weak link and cannot survive the extra forces generated by overcoming stiff hinges or too stiff struts.
2,Cheap Plastic Cracks After A Few Years' Use,"I used these stands for about 3-4 years without any problems. Then after years of use, the plastic on the base slowly started cracking, thus pretty much making these stands useless. I can't find any place to buy a replacement bracket at the bottom, so I'll need to purchase brand new stands, but not from Proline.If you're only looking to use them for 3 years, buy them; otherwise, they will not last longer than that!"
5,HEART -ACHING ROMANTICISM,"Thibaudet is rapidly becoming my favorite in the crop of current 'star' pianists. His recordings of Ravel and Debussy and Liszt are tops in the field and now this CD of Chopin piano solo music has been released and it is just as fine. This sampling of Etudes, Mazurkas and Nocturnes, etc. are all played so perfectly: this is heart-aching Romanticism at its peak. Decca has also been generous: the recording is actually more than 78 minutes long. The 4 bonus tracks played on Chopin's own piano prove to be more than just a clever gimmick. It is really interesting for an amateur like myself to compare the composer's piano with the pianist's. Thibaudet is quoted in the fine essay that comes along with the CD: ""...the beautiful thing is that his (Chopin's) spirit is alive and in his music."" Yes...especially in this lovely album. Very Highly Recommended."
1,Does no fit,This product does not fit my Audi A4 1.8 quattro as stated. The holes line up on the valve cover but the electrical connections do not match. Returned.
1,One star is too good for this book.,"Unlike Joan Robie would have you believe, Eastman and Laird didn't create characters designed to turn your children into violent criminals. Instead, they created a wonderful spoof of the comic book genre that went from a cult hit amongst adults in it's B&W comic book format to a worldwide phenomenom among children. Unfortunately the author spent too much time with her blinders on to see either the humor or the positive teachings within the Turtles universe (and martial arts in general). The world could use a lot more of Mike, Raph, Leo and Don and lot less books like this one."
3,"If this book ""killed"" your childhood and ruined your memories, you need mental help ASAP","I grew up on Leo, Raph, Don, and Mikey too, and it is true that the women who wrote this ""Exposed!"" book is a kook, but you have to admit that what she writes is hilarious. Similarly to the dumbasses who call Harry Potter ""satanic"" (including the new Pope who used to be a former Nazi), Joan Hake Robie uses a similar religious ideology to spoil kids' fun. If your childhood memories of the Turtles can be so easily shattered, it just goes to show that those ""cherished"" memories of yours probably weren't so special to begin with. And if she's ""killing"" your childhood, as a previous reviewer said, then you need to start seeing a psychiatrist, because it's not normal for someone's childhood to be ""killed"" by a few wacked-out evangelist interpretations of the Ninja Turtles. At this rate, you guys are gonna end up Julie like Joan Hake Robie-- an embittered and senile old tart who looks at the world WAY too seriously."
1,Go Home and Stay There Joan,This author needs to be stopped. And we should pray for all of those that have such weak will sand minds as to believe joan's insanity. She could be one of the false profit$.
1,Why does this have titanium dioxide??,"I used to be able to find Alba sunscreen WITHOUT Titanium Dioxide. Now the ""new and improved"" stuff has it in it. Very disappointed. I want natural products that don't contain dangerous ingredients. Will be looking for a new product to buy."
2,Can't stand the smell,Don't get this product if you have scent allergies or scent sensitivity. The smell is overpowering. The product does go on smoothly and there are no white streaks.
3,bad earring backs,"The earrings themselves are quite pretty, but the backs are VERY loose (one fell off on my morning walk to work without me even touching it!). I have already lost both backs, so I am going to have to buy replacements in order to actually be able to wear these anymore."
5,"Great pin for 2.5"" receiver","This worked great on a F250 2011 Ford pick up with a 2.5"" receiver. Much sturdier and more solid compared to the Master Lock version."
2,I Gave This Book To My Library,"I only keep those books I really like. I'm not a literary critic, but I do read at least 2 books a week, so I'm fairly ""well read"" (whatever that means)."
5,Not a typical suspense novel,"I immediately sought this book out after reading The Rosary Girls. Both are top-notch thrillers that present characters that go beyond the usual one dimensional thriller cliches. Kevin Byrne remains one of my favorite contemporary fictional detectives, and not just because I envy his ability to beat criminals with impunity. His relationships with his daughter and partner are some of the highlights of the story and don't take away from the mystery, unlike so many other novels that get sidetracked by characterization. The plot is easily summed up as the hunt for a serial killer who draws inspiration from cinematic death sequences, but would quickly become boring if this was all that was at stake. The characters are expertly written, as is the setting. It is hard to believe the author isn't from Philadelphia. I highly recommend this book."
3,"Decent Thriller, But Nothing Special","As thrillers go, this was a decent one. The book held my interest, and i was eager to read the solution to the mystery. The two lead characters had good backstories, and they were likable enough to allow me to care what happened to them. the author creates an almost airtight case for one person being the murderer, then the book takes a left turn and it someone completely different. It was a little jarring, but I like the fact that the mystery was complex and not easily solved.The only reason I'm giving it three stars instead of more is that there wasn't a whole lot in this book to differentiate it from other thrillers in the genre. I suspect that not long after I have finished reading it, I will forget most of the details of the plot. It's a good book, a solid thriller, but nothing that stands out as being particularly new or original."
4,Well-Crafted Police Procedural,"Montanari is an excellent thriller writer, almost the equal of Connelly, Crais, Lescroart and the like. His ability to hook the reader with constant suspense is scary. His detailed knowledge of the Philadelphia police and the city they serve is head-spinning. And this book -- the second Montanari book I've read -- is a real grabber. My only complaints are (a)there are too many characters in the book and you constantly have to be reminded who's who, and (2) the plot was a little too complicated. Also, I was disappointed when I found out who the bad guy was, because -- I don't want to spoil the ending -- the way the bad guy was portrayed didn't seem fair to the reader. You'll see what I mean. Anyhow, all in all, a wonderful read from a writer whose future books I'll look forward to with gusto."
3,Revisions Needed,"While this is the 'stand alone' book on cloud physics it could use an update. Some of the answers to problems in the back are incorrect and the problems are very difficult/hard to process based on information given in the text. Variables are defined once in-text with no other reference unless they change and no nomenclature section is given. While the content is good this makes it hard to follow, but this could be easily remedied!"
1,You get what you pay for.,"I bought one set for me and another for my brother-in-law and both sets broke within a week. I only paid $5.56 for each, but I don't even want a replacement. These are cheaply made and if you use them more than once, they will break. The plastic case was the only thing that I still have. A piece of junk."
4,A needed accessory,I don't care much for the shell case. But it does provide protection.What's great is the car charger. Very Useful! And the travel charger I keep at the office. It works fine too. All this for a lot less than what Verizon wanted to charge me. A whole lot less.
2,Slow and Disappointing,"I was so excited to read this book which had been given a solid ""A"" from Entertainment Weekly and accolades from other reviewers that I went right out and paid full price for it from my local book store.I began it with much anticipation, but slowly found it to be less than enthralling. Nevertheless, I gave it a chance. Some chapters I found to be somewhat suspenseful, only to find Simmons return to another viewpoint that dragged on with too many details and no suspense whatsoever. I do not mind multi-character narration. In fact some of my favorite books ever are thick books with a similar narration.After much disappointment and frustration, I finally gave it up after getting about one-third of the way through. After getting back on Amazon to read what other reviewers said, I understand that the end was a frustration for many, so I'm glad I didn't persevere with it."
5,Outstanding and ingenious,"I bought this with some trepidation and based on the mostly positive reviews and reading the authors SF novel ""Hyperion"". The trepidation derived from the introduction of a supernatural monster - quite unnecessary, I thought. I was completely wrong. This extra element elevates the tragic history of the Franklin expedition into a thrilling and even more pathos-filled story. Add in the elements of ""backstory"" that the author judiciously introduces and this becomes a phenomenal and as far as I can tell accurate picture of the desperate life of polar explorers. This novel will join ""Arctic Dreams"" (Barry Lopez) and ""The Worst Journey in the World"" (Cherry-Garrard) as inspiring evocations of hostile environments.Fabulous book. Read it."
5,Jump on the sledge.,"A tremendous epic, beautifully written - combination of horror, historical novel and eskimo fantasy. Even at 700 plus pages it's relentlessly gripping."
5,Amazing Storytelling!,Terror is the first Dan Simmons book I have read. It was an awesome adventure and led me to study more of the facts behind the search for an arctic passage. I highly recommend this book. And I will be reading more of Mr. Simmons works. Thanks Dan for a fantastic trip
2,The Book Was Too Long!,"This is a long book, I really don't want to down it because of all the work it took to research each person accurately and I think the author did a fabulous job. But after awhile, I totally got that it was cold, they were trapped, they were afraid of what was killing the sailors out on the ice, but he could have done it in 1/2 the time. Great character development. There were no survivors of the Franklin Expedition and what's crazy is, if they had gone right instead of left at the island they were to be trapped in the ice for years, they would have found the northwest passage and been alive heros instead of dead ones. Ultimately the search parties were able to map this frozen landscape which lead to the success of finding the way through 60 years later."
4,I am Cold.,"This is a big book, and i only say that because i am afraid of big books. Usually you would think ""wow thats a big book, must mean that the author has something to say, a story to tell"" and sometimes these big books, are a whole lot of *nothing*, you read and you read and you read some mo, and you are left asleep on the couch with drool for a bookmark. This book, is big for all the right reasons. Dan Simmons did some research, and you can tell that he even researched his research. Simmons was so descriptive that i found myself looking around for rats, checking my self for scurvy, and asking my husband to turn up the heat because i was freaking cold! I love historical novels, biographies of explorers, monster books and medical stories, this book satisfied all those cravings and then some. The only reason i am giving it 4 not 5 is because at some points...the flashbacks, and the flashbacks flashing back got confusing. This book will not dissapoint you!"
4,Terror in the North,"Intriguing take on the failed Sir James Ross voyage to the Arctic in order to find fabled North-West passage. This is the story about harrowing time spent by British Navy marines and sailors, and its officers in the far North. The terror of wintering in frozen waters of the Polar See and the presence of some Supernatural monster is combined quite well and helps the plot to be captivating. However, at the end of the book, there are some boring sections, where Eskimo's mythology is mixed with real tragedy of dying and staying alive in the Arctic. And although, the presence of the Supernatural didn't bother me during most of the book, the explanation of its existence made me perturbed. I wished also for more stories about some characters that disappeared from the book by the end without clear explanation of their fate. The book is interesting for the most part but looses its zest at the end."
2,yawn,"I have been a big fan of Simmons since reading the Hyperion series. But, this was boring. 700+ pages of boring. It started out with promise, but just went nowhere and wasn't scarry. If I am skipping several pages at a time, there is a problem. Stephen King (another author I like) must have given him the ""elephantitus"" disease of stretching out books way past their due."
3,680 Pages of Good 70 of Bad,"Amazing how a book that is so good and building a nice tale can spiral into an abyss of dull in the final chapters. Do yourself a favor and add a ""The End"" after the final paragraph of page 682 and pretend the rest of the story doesn't exist. Your Inua will thank you. The final 70 pages felt very rushed and detached from the remainder of the book."
2,Like Watching Ice Melt,"All the books I read come well recommended by one source or another. That's why it's so disappointing when a book that I've been looking forward to reading sucks. This book is too long, by about 300 pages, and as slow in it's plotting as ice melting. Simmons tries to combine a failed Arctic adventure with a horror story and while the atmospherics work real well with the crew stranded for years on end, snow, cold, depravation, etc., its up to the reader to plow through all their deaths, their drudgery leading to their deaths, their drudgery trying to fight off their deaths, their drudgery surviving death, and the only payoff at the end is a very weak reveal--that thing trying to kill them is some Eskimo spirit creation that couldn't be killed by any natural means anyway."
2,Over-rated,"I am a huge fan of polar adventure stories, but this one is too long, repetitious, and misogynistic. I haven't read any horror stories before, but if this is a prime example, it must be a boring genre. White snow monster eats sailor, eats another sailor, dismembers another sailor, ad (literally) nauseum. The novel is more disturbing for how it portrays women: unknowable, sexualized (there is one sex scene with Crozier and a society woman which is almost laughable in its unrealistic male fantasy depiction), and only worthy if their tongues are cut out."
3,Left be a bit cold,"While ""The Terror"" is a compelling read, and clearly well researched and well written... I did not find myself emotionally attached to any of the charactors. I think I was expecting something more along the lines of Howard Hawkes, ""The Thing"". It's not a supernatural thriller; more along the lines of Jack London man vs the elements. I did read this huge volume in a couple of days, so it is highy readable. Just didn't come away fully satisfied."
3,page turner,Dan Simmons has a true gift in developing his charters. The novel had good bones and deserved to be left with the horrors that were inherent. The monster on the ice and the explanation of this ficticious/superstious being wasn't nessary. I enjoyed the book as a whole but I do not know if I would read another novel by Dan Simmons
2,too much foul language and too long,"When I reviewed this I forgot to mention that the F word is used liberally throughout. Was that word even used as a cuss word at the time of the story. If you don't like foul language in your reading, skip this book."
4,Great read--a few flaws,"I loved the book, but I would like to raise the issue of fanciful geography. The author described temperatures that were unrealistically low, like -100F in April. It is very doubtful that it ever got that cold in January, much less April. Another little glitch: the description of endlessly long arctic nights in March. The days and nights in late March are the same length in the arctic as they are on the equator. That's why March 21st (and September 21st) is called the Equinox."
2,"Too long, too bleak","I love books about the arctic and antarctic. I love adventure stories. I couldn't make it through the Terror. Somewhat compelling early, the fate of the crew, almost hopeless, goes to completely hopeless at about page 500. Very long odds are cut to zero in a way that made me uninterested in reading further to discover how the crew actually met their demise. I walked out of the cafe and dropped the book in the nearest rubbish bin, unwilling even to subject anyone else to the Terror."
2,Poor,"This book starts out promisingly. The writing is fantastic and you keep waiting for the book to erupt. However, it never does. There is one exciting action scene and just when you think the book has gotten good, it fizzles out with 300 pages to go. The monster turns out to be ridiculous and the books turns into a vodoo style romance. Also, the actions of the crew make no sense. They don't send messages, they don't catch food, they just die. Skip this book. Instead, read The Keep by F. Paul Wilson, a great horror novel framed by World War II."
3,Decent airplane book but nothing special,"Loads of detail describing the experience of being stuck in Arctic ice for 2 years, which is interesting but simply overwhelms the character development, cultural contrasts, and plot motion. The author needed a critical editor to bring some balance.SPOILER: And there's an ice monster too, which of course eats the arrogant, technology-dependent Europeans but is actually a god, which is of course appreciated by the nature-tuned, psychic natives. The ending was rather silly and predictable from around the middle of the novel.Good wordsmithing though. Decent airplane book."
3,"Good story, could've been shorter","Rarely am I so relieved to reach the end of a book. This book just went on & on & on.Of itself, I think the story is fascinating, and it takes a great deal of imagination to tell a story when little to no first-person documentation exists. But I feel like so much could've been left out or condensed."
2,"On ""The Terror""","Like a number of others, I am trying to wade through this ponderous piece. How any author can make an action adventure tedious is beyond belief. But Simmons manages. I agree that this novel is about 600 pages too long. It's clear that the author gets paid by the word."
3,Terror - Slow read,"I found the novel difficult to get through. While the story is interesting, it is slow paced and does not hold the attention of the reader."
2,Boring,I found it to be boring. Sorry. I thought I was getting a horror novel mostly about a monster but a lot of the book was about the crew members. So many characters I had a hard time keeping straight who was who.
5,Shivers!,"Wrap yourself up in your blanket, prop up your pillow and hold on tight! What a book! I haven't read anything by Simmons in a while, the last book was ""A winters haunting"" which was a bit of a disappointment. But he sure made up for it in this novel. There's just about something for everyone. Adventure, history, survival, horror, you name it. Based on a true story about the artic expedition makes it even more readable. It's long, but well worth it. Hurry to the bookstore before the ice thaws!"
2,400 Pages of Arctic Excitement Packed into 800 pages,"Yes, you read my title right. This novel should have been about 400 pages long. There's a lot that needed to be chopped. The story is compelling, the research is interesting, the monster is scary, and the characters are great. But the story is too drawn out. Simmons needs to fire his editor (if he has one at all), get a better one, or if he has a good one...start listening to him. That's the only thing wrong with this novel. Its too long and drawn out. If he had chopped it and picked up the pace it would have been a great novel."
4,Would be great if it was cut down in size,"Simmons has written some brilliant books - consequently I am a fan. He also has written about his early experiences in writing novels, especially about his traumatic experiences with early editors. While I will always side with the author, a part of me thinks novels like this would be even more incredible if it was shorter. So forgive me if my reviews are shorter than most others but this is just to say that this is another great Simmons book, that Simmons fans will enjoy. For others wanting to start a Simmons book, I recommend Song of Kali."
3,Just okay,"I think Dan Simmons is a talented author and I do enjoy historical novels, but this book seems to have lost something along the way. I was hoping for more horror and more excitement. ""The Terror"" detailed the expedition across the Artic and how these men were stuck in the ice. The first 300 pages showed promise but then it teetered off. I didn't mind that each chapter was from a different person's point of view, but I didn't feel for the characters to really care about them. I lost interest until the last 100 pages when it became intriguing again. Nine hundred pages plus, was a lot to read but not riveting enough to recommend."
2,There's no Terror here,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. It started out slow and never recovered. Moreover almost from the start it presented a premise of ""unknown terror"" which completely negated any interest the book might have had as a possible reconstruction of what really happened to these ill fated sailors. This book pales in comparison to ""One Day the Ice will Reveal all Its Dead""."
2,WAY too prolix,There is a story here but it is buried under mountains of unprocessed prose. Whatever happened to editors who know how to rein in the rambling self-indulgences of a verbally undisciplined writer?
1,"Not ""The Terror"" but ""The Torture""","The monster wasn't scary or even really identified. The plot was way too long. The book was not in the least bit interesting from a historical aspect and it was far from being ""terrifying"". This book was a huge disappointment. The reader experiences more torture in getting through this book than the characters experience in its pages."
1,Truly terrible,"There are no words that I can use to describe how bad this book really is. Not only does it take forever to pick up, when something actually is happening, it is the complete opposite of what you want, or expect. And not in a good way. It's honestly one of the worst books I've read, and I read a lot. Just don't even try it."
1,A disappointment,"Not what I was expecting at all; I plowed on through to the end, hoping it would get better. If you're into history and exceedingly (to an excruciating degree!) detailed description of daily activities, you might like this one. Very little of the monster; lots of description of how this expedition fell apart due to human failings. Was sort of as if watching the movie ""Master and Commander""--which I liked, incidentally--but they stretched it out to be about 6 hours long."
1,In Serious Need of Editing,"I cannot help but wonder how long this book would have been had Mr. Simmons chosen to restrict himself to retelling the same thing to only every other chapter, or every third chapter, or perhaps only once? As a reader I did not feel I needed to be beaten over the head with constant reminders of just how bad things were for these men. Once was enough, thank you very much. The story moves at such a snail's pace one cannot help but identify with the tedium and agony these men went though. At least my suffering ended when they abandoned ship - I abandoned the book."
1,A 100 page novel crammed into 700 pages,"This book is about two ships that are stranded in the ice for over three years. If you think that would be boring your right and so is this book. The monster doesn't appear for two hundred pages and when it does it is only a white shadow, wow how scary and exciting. I only finished this because I was hopping it would get interesting but unfortunately no such luck. The cover has Steven King giving the author praise, I doubt Steven King read this book.Don't waste your time or money on this."
3,Promising but slow in the first half of the novel.,"This was a well researched historical based novel that started slowly but about half way thru I couldn't put the kindle down. I was amazed to learn the characters were fact based and the events had some degree of probability, Well written by a talented author."
5,More Shackelton than King,Don't be put off by the supernatural subplot within Simmons' novel. The Terror is more Shackelton than King and more Pressfield than Koontz. Excellent easy read with suspense that keeps you turning the pages with anticipation or anguish at the despair unfolding before you.
5,Not your Daddy's Maritime Tail,"Dan Simmons has once again provided his readers with fiction of the highest caliber. I had this book pre-ordered for nearly a year and I was certainly not disappointed. Also, I was appalled at the NYT for calling this a ""779 page book about men stuck in ice."" That is as absurd as saying that ""Moby Dick is an 850 page book about a guy trying to kill a big whale.""I think the cultural elite grow weary of Simmons' propensity to be didactic. He is a former teacher and he can't help himself, I believe. However, it is refreshing for me to be taught while entertained...whether it be literature or in this case, history.I must say that I have never been a great fan of swash-buckling high seas adventure stories. This work shatters that mold completely."
2,"Too cold, too long, too harsh","I've enjoyed many of Simmons's novels. But I had difficulty finishing this book. It seemed an exercise in suffering. Too often I read passages that seemed cut and pasted about the crew, the harsh weather, the bitter cold, the threats.... It became an exercise in futility.There is also a weird sense of the Noble Savage in the role of a female eskimo that is seen as a dangerous, eroticized object and witch. Even more disturbing is some homophobic elements - I'm not saying the author is homophobic, but there are passages in the book where the good gay men are sexless and intellectual and the bad gay men are randy beasts. Thats a very odd view and it troubled me greatly."
5,Highly recommened,"This was the first Dan Simmons book I'd read and it was quite a treat. Amazingly well written with a terrifying and compelling story. Very bleak and depressing for much of it though, so not for the faint of heart. One of the best novels I've ever read."
2,"2/3 one story, 1/3 another","I'll keep it simple since others have made the point much better than I.At about 2/3 of the way through the book, it slips away from the crew and to the mysticism exclusively. Having poured oneself into the crew and the ship, the become little more than toss-a-ways for where the story goes from there. Of no importance.From Gothic Sea-Going horror to some sort of environmental supernatural. Interesting stuff, but there really needed to be some consistant resolve to the first 2/3 rather than just dismissing it."
2,Sadistic on many levels,"This book starts out as a good historical novel but soon drags the reader over one pressure ridge after another of disturbing monotony. When something finally happens the author seems to spend an indecent amount of ink describing in gruesome detail the various modes of violent death he inflicts on his doomed characters - while stretching the credibility factor to the breaking point.I guess when writing a story with an ending everyone knows, it's understandable that the writer might be compelled to take some liberties and add some flourishes. This writer has chosen to devise a menagerie of sadistic and cruel ways for these poor sods to die, with long, pointless chapters in between. That pretty much sums up the novel.The mysterious creature adds nothing to the narrative and is explained away in the final pages as the manifestation of some sort of Eskimo spiritual dribble.Franklin's failed expedition becomes the best metaphor I can think of for this novel."
2,Long and Tedious,"I love the premise of this novel. An imagining of what could have happened to a real expedition. I settled in for an interesting read that combined fact and fiction.I loved the details, at first. The author obviously spent a great deal of time and effort researching for this novel and I will say it was quite refreshing to see that. But then the details became repetitive and I grew frustrated with the flip-flopping between characters and times. It IS possible for a novel to be too verbose. Exceedingly long and (more often than not) overwhelmingly tedious. Yes, I could feel the cold and at times this novel was entertaining. But then it would get bogged down in the massive amounts of details. Repetitive details. Oh, wait, I mentioned the repetitive details already. Well, you get my meaning.Not a keeper for me."
2,HOW cold WAS it?,"I thought I was on to something here.Great detail, feeling, depth.The men are lost and wretched.Doom is all around.What will they do?Then ... it all turned to mystical bleep.I found the the ending disappointing and empty.A cheap trick.Beware.For real."
2,The page-to-content ratio is too high here,"""The Terror"" is the kernel of a good story wrapped in an extraneous 500 pages. Dan Simmons has already proved himself capable of relatively concise, enjoyable horror with ""Song of Kali,"" so I am especially disappointed by The Terror.A few of the issues I have with The Terror:-Simmons repeats himself to an astonishing degree.-Clumsy references to Shakespeare, especially Hamlet-The 'thing on the ice' is not remotely scary, and serves no metaphorical purpose-Ridiculous amount of silly details about non-essential characters that are supposed to pass for 'character development' but really end up annoying the reader-It's far too long!-The platitudinous, ridiculous ending.If you want good Simmons horror, re-read Song of Kali."
5,One of the best novels of the past several years,"I agree with the mostly glowing reviews found here. Dan Simmons's ""The Terror"" is simply fantastic. Well rounded characters, an amazing sense of place, and a plot that is gripping to its core. Over the course of the novel, the reader truly begins to feel that they know each of the men and one woman on board the ships Terror and Erebus. It makes what ultimately befalls them that much more affecting. Warning: some scenes are quite gruesome, and this is hardly a lighthearted read. Still, at well over 700 pages, there is nary a wasted word.I've read a few of the classic Hyperion novels; this is even better. Those works, combined with The Terror, make Dan Simmons one of today's ""must read"" authors."
2,Too long:,"Too long, too repetitious, too detailed, too many characters.After page 600 or so, I had to force myself to keep reading; and eventually I started skipping ahead. I got to page 840 with still 100 more pages to go, and I finally gave up."
5,Audio version is superb,"Just would like to add that the unabridged version read by John Lee is extremely well done, one of the best readings I have listened to."
2,Very Good - Then Very Bad,"I really don't think this book needs another review, but I thought I would add in my two cents. Frankly, I did not find the book ponderous or overly lengthy. It is a good page turner and a good read, as long as you understand it is historically unreal. What dropped this from perhaps a 4-star read down to 2-stars is the fact that about 3/4 of the way through the book it simply becomes ridiculous, almost silly. I could not understand what the author was doing. He had a compelling survival-in-the-arctic story running, and then blows it with some absurd hoodoo-voodoo romance silly monster nonsense. It was almost like he decided in mid-stream to change the type of novel he was writing. Truly bizarre and very unsatisfying."
2,A Disappointment,"I read the reviews and thought this would be a great read. However, upon seeing it in the library at 700 pages I had my doubts. My fears were confirmed. The Terror is a dud. If you like overly long stories with minimal action and suspense (a'la Stephen King) you might like this. Take a doomed Actic expedition throw in a mysterious creature , a malarial, clairvoyant captain and over the 700 pages you to will feel trapped in the ice. I've never read Simmons' work and am not impressed.Good idea, poor execution. Flashbacks that are meaningless and go on and on. Just don't bother."
1,could this book be any longer?,"This is the ffirst time ive read Mr. Simmons.Oh boy, so not impressed. I wanted to stop reading after about 100 pages.But because im a cheap s.o.b. and i paid for the friggin' thing, damnit! i will finish it, oh yes, i will finish it.Thankfully I contracted pnemonia so i ahd alot of spare time. Is he a man's writer? not to stereotype or anything. I really couldnt get my head around his plot..I looked it up online, and apparently, it is a true story.Artic expedition frozen in the ice wating for a thaw and something is stalking them and killing them off one by one. What could it possibly be?hmmmm...lets throw in some eskimo folklore and pages upon pages upon pages of a story that could have been 300 pages less.left a ver bad taste in my mouth and am not anticipating anything this particular author has to offer."
1,Save Your Money!,A shaggy dog story full of saw dust. A story line as padded as the bras at my prom. Characters created just to be eaten. Unbelivable twists. I really wish I had just given the money to a bum. I put it up unfinished. Great cover and blurbs though!
4,Enjoy a good read,"After reading ""Summer of Night"" I became a Dan Simmons fan and ""The Terror"" is a excellent addition to anyone's Simmons library. Not just for the ""thing on the ice"" but the tale of men trying to survive under near impossible conditions."
1,Uggh...,"Is it too much to ask for a book on writing to be well written?Writing the Short Flim was tedious. Reading the book was like trying to run underwater. The writers talked and talked and talked yet managed to say little if anything at all. The end result if feeling as if your brain had been smashed out of your skull with a hollow, plastic baseball bat.There were some helpful insights, however they are few and far between. In fact, it came down to one useful bit of information per 20 pages. 20 pages of tedious, headache inducing rambling for one sentence of useful information.There are many other writing books that are much more helpful: Syn and Syntax. Story by Robert McKee. Writing for Emotional Impact by Karl Iglesias. Writing Short Scripts by William H. Phillips. And David Mamet's Three Uses of the Knife."
4,An excellent precis of Lindsay's life and work,"This small book is ideal for anyone who has read A Voyage to Arcturus, and who is intrigued and haunted, but confused. Wolfe explains many of Lindsay's motives (as far as anyone can know them), and gives concise summaries of Lindsay's other books. Personally, I have read Arcturus, The Haunted Woman, Sphinx, and The Violet Apple, and Lindsay's vision continues to mesmerise me, despite the clumsiness of his writing."
3,Some good insights,"As an avid reader of cross-cultural books, this one has some good nuggets that will help me and my team to figure out why Americans at work are sometimes not as straightforward as I first thought. There's another book on the subject that's better at the in-depth study and explanation of Americans in the workplace called ""Working with Americans"" (Denslow and Stewart-Allen) which I think is more helpful."
5,Excellent introduction to US Business Practices,"I found this book profoundly useful when moving from the UK to the US. While it cannot stop the kinds of cross-cultural frustration that everyone feels in a new environment, it provides excellent insights into the ways of thought in America. As a result, it will help you be less out of step with your American colleagues and you will have fewer moments of complete mutual incomprehension. Use the ideas in the book to rephrase your comments and suggestions to fit with US cultural drivers and you will find your them responding with unexpected enthusiasm. Remember, you are always ""fine"" or ""good"", your work is interesting and rewarding and, if you are not completely happy to be there, you are certainly ""psyched"" to dig in to the day's work. One of Storti's other books ""The Art of Crossing Cultures"" is also useful but is less US focussed."
1,Poor service,I ordered this book and another book called International Management Behavior. They were not delivered. I have not yet been refunded my money for International Management Behavior even though I never got that book.
2,Too much noise even at low volumes,"Very average quality speaker system. Too much noise even at low volumes. Even with highest recording quality files, the volume is horribly noisy."
1,Horrible Sound Quality,"I bought one and I couldn't put up with the static coming from the speakers. There was even static when I paused the ipod. I returned that one and got a second one hoping that the first was just defective. The second one that I received had the same awful sound quality, and the remote hardly worked! Maybe they were both defective, but I've decided to try a different company that doesn't put out as many defective units."
4,Freddy Fish,"This is a very fun game for young kids, however, it was not specified anywhere that for a mac, we needed a much earlier version of OS. I had to purchase this off ebay, it is no longer being sold. What a hassle!!!!"
4,Good,Good ingredients without the magnesium stearate. It just didn't make a noticeable change in the way I felt. I'm relying on raw foods to do that now.
5,Wish thevRail System Was Still Operating,"Very useful information. I liked it for researching historical fiction. When you read bout the era of the rail system, you realize they used the rail like we use the sky's today. There were business travelers and those who traveled for pleasure. The railroad is under rated for developing the West.Woodcutter's Revival."
1,Needs to Check His Facts,"Tom Baker has displayed very sloppy research for this book. He takes libelous, sensationalized news articles written by reporters who never interviewed those involved in cases and uses them as the basis of fact in his book. I am constantly amazed that in this day of almost instant communication, reporters and authors cannot go to the source but rely on second-hand, and often poorly researched, information.I can't finish a book with blatant libelous statements - how many other false statements are made? His use of peer-reviewed journals and studies as resources does not negate his use of biased shock journalism. Of course Mr. Baker is well aware that the victims of libel have even fewer rights than the victims of medical malpractice."
5,Great for bread!,"Using gluten in bread allows your bread to rise well, even if low or no gluten products are added -- like amaranth flour, teff, spelt, rye flour, cornmeal, etc. It even helps sourdough rise well. We have really interesting bread now, with lovely texture -- nothing leaden anymore."
5,A very useful addition to bread.,"I originally bought this to help my wheat bread rise better. It does this very well, of course, and supplies even more nutritional value to the bread.I started making cinnamon bread, and give it as a treat to pets because they love it, especially the chickens. Normally, I use white flour, which of course is nutritionally poor. I add four tablespoons of this, and it not only improves the texture and flavor, but it adds nutritional value to the cinnamon bread, so I don't feel bad about giving it as a treat."
5,Highest percentage of protein!,"This is the best vital wheat gluten for Seitan, has the highest percentage of protein and best of all, the lowest price per pound compared to all brands on amazon. To check percent of protein, go to the link listed below.[...]"
5,The Price is Right!,"I was buying Arrowhead Mills VWG at Whole Foods, and the price was ridiculous. The price is much better on this so I can keep cookin'!"
4,Just What I Needed...,My once part-time hobby has turned into a part-time business. The amount of people who need Headshots in Los Angeles out-weighs the number of Photographers..supply and demand. The Tamron lens is just what I needed to meed the demand.
3,Difficulty taking sharp photos,"I knew this lens did not have stablization when purchased, but even in best conditions I had difficulty getting clear, sharp shots.The problem might be with my own skills or perhaps possibly a defective lens, but I didn't want to work so hard every time I wanted a decent picture.I returned this lens and purchased the Canon EF-S 55 - 250mm lens. This lens is much better suited for me (although more costly and still not the best lens for extremely sharp telephoto shots but fairly easy to acheive clear shake-free pictures).I gave the Tamron lens 3 stars because more skilled users no doubt will get better results than I."
5,Nice lens even if twice as much $$,"I finally went digital with a Canon XSi after many years with film SLR's. In the old days I used a fixed 300mm lens f4.5-f22 manual focus and all. Well, this new Tamron AF 75-300mm f/4.0-5.6 is better in many ways. I get very good sharp images, it's light and a joy to hold, auto focus is good but I use manual focus most of the time; it's what I'm used to. With good holding technique I can get away with 4.0@1/60th and with a mono pod or walking stick I can go to 1/30th. Sunset Electronics shipped very fast and offer great customer service if required."
3,Be Careful About the Macro Claim- Shame on Amazon,"I puchased this for my Canon Rebel XSI. Obviously, you purhcase this lense for the telephoto capability, but it also claims to serve as a ""macro"" as well. Well, after my Sigma true macro lense failed to work with the XSI (as I had been falsely promised it would work), I tried use the Tamron in its place. Well. Don't. Some of the Tamron lenses do have a Macro ""switch"". This one does NOT. Instead, you have to rely on the right combination of focal length and zoom settings, and you must be at least a meter away from the subject. I'm disappointed they even try to pass this off as Macro photography.So it's a good zoom lense, but if you are interested because you think you are also getting a macro, jokes on you. The 572 D apparently has the switch, but this is the 672 D.Sham on Amazon for not explaining this in a little more detail."
5,Superb!,"This is one instance you can forget the axiom about ""getting what you pay for."" Despite what may be a relatively low price, it's an absolutely superb lens: fast, responsive, with a nice ""feel"" to the barrel. It usually quickly finds the focus point, and I've yet to experience (in one month of use) the so-called focus ""searching"" that others allude to. Buy this lens; you absolutely cannot go wrong."
5,Great Lens!,"I purchased the Tamron AF 75-300mm Lens after reading through all the reviews from other customers. I have a Canon EOS 20D and this was the perfect fit. I'm not a professional photographer (yet!), but this has been a great purchase. The auto focus is fairly quick and the zoom is just about right. I'll post some pictures I've been taking with this lens from the past 2 weeks. Very nice for the price."
4,beautiful. simple.,"For the intermediate photographer, this is a wonderful lens. Great response. Not too heavy. For the price, I don't think you could do much better!Gregory GodseyBoynton Beach Florida"
3,"A Great Lens, But Will it Last?","I'm an amateur photographer, when i first got the lens i was very happy with it, i mean it was great, long distance, minimal chromatic abberation, but then a month after purchase, it was in my backpack, i asked my friend to pass the bag to me, and it dropped about half a foot, and now the zooming bearing no longer worksI mean don't get me wrong it's very good, if you beleive that you can take good care of it i would greatly suggest it as an entry level telephoto for the amateur photographer to experiment with.I'm sure there are better Lenses, but if you're going to pay much more money.Pros: Cheap, Effective, Very good outdoors, Very Sharp at f/8.0, can't be beat for the priceCons: Bad indoors, no Image Stabilization so it's not very stable under a shutter speed of 1/30, not very good shock resistantUltimately i would suggest this lens. Get it, it's cheap, if you want to spend 500 dollars though, get the 70-300mm Canon IS USM lens, it's better, but 5 times the price."
3,ok for the price,i bought this lens only because i needed a zoom lens. and because it was under 200 dollars. you do get what you pay for. the lack of an auto focus is some what an inconvenience when you need to focus quickly. the product says it is for canon cameras. i am using it on a nikon d3000. so it can work for either. all in in all its not a bad lens for the price. just be ready to sacrifice a little bit of sharpness and you will be satisfied
5,Mariner,"This my favorite of Tony O'Connor's CD. It makes one feel as if they are sitting right next to the sea, enjoying peace and tranquility!"
3,A Little Disappointed,MarinerI ordered this cd as a gift for someone. When I received it had a very large crack in it. I will not be giving it as a gift with a damaged case. Willtry to find the same product elsewhere.
1,A waste of money,"I bought this antenna to use in a rural area on a panasonic radio that comes only with a small wire antenna. My old boom box (which died) had a 30"" telescoping antenna and pulled in several dozen stations. The Terk pulled in one on the new Panasonic. Thinking that the problem might be with the radio, I plugged in the wire antenna. The reception improved to a handful of stations. Next, I tried rabbit ears left over from the pre digital TV era. Once again, I was able to pull in several dozen stations. It's pretty bad when a simple wire antenna outperforms the Terk. Don't waste your money on this item. I could have returned it to Amazon, but the shipping costs would have been more than the refund."
3,"Gave it a shot, it's not that great","I was a bit hesitant with this antenna after reading the reviews but it was so cheap I decided to give it a shot anyway. I also bought a standard dipole wire antenna and honestly the dipole gives me better reception. The Terk antenna was ok when I was holding it but it was incredibly temperamental and the slightest bit of movement or rotation would throw the signal off. I got this antenna, the dipole, and a 300 to 75 ohm adapter all for less than $20 so by all means give this one a shot if you want, maybe you'll have better results :P"
2,Its better than nothing,"I made a bipolar FM antenna for my receiver worth $2.5 and wanted to compare this product for betterment of signal. Also I bought FM transmitter for my iPOD (that works perfect in my car) and wanted to listen through the receiver wireless at home. But its very disappointing that this product couldn't deliver any better signal (static less) from the existing free to air FM channels. Even in case of iPOD FM transmitted signal (may be 2-3 feet apart from the antenna) couldn't get picked up staticless. If I position my dipole antenna carefully, it serves the purpose. Its so surprising that this product is worse than my handmade dipole antenna. I've to look for something else. So I guess this antenna is better than nothing."
2,No better than a wire antenna,"This antenna works, but no better than the ""in the box"" wire FM antenna that came with my receiver. On the third floor of my house I was barely receiving my favorite FM station and so bought this antenna to improve reception. It did not improve reception, even after trying multiple elevated positions."
4,Cool FM Antenna,"This product replaces your old ""T"" type antenna. I was not able to find significant improvement in difficult reception areas with my analog FM. I was more pleased with the effect on my HD FM radio signal. I does look nicer and is much less sensitive to placement. Overall I have enjoyed this purchase and would repeat the purchase. (I have 5 of these, one for each of my various units around the house and at work.)"
2,Not impressed,"After moving to a new apartment, my radio reception was really poor, so I purchased the Terk FM+ indoor antenna. While installing it, I found two things: 1) my existing (basic wire) antenna was dramatically improved by wiggling/adjusting where it connects to the stereo; 2) this Terk antenna created regular bursts of static which I found intolerable. So, I'm not using it and do not recommend it."
2,Buyer beware,"My first complaint is that the ""instructions"" that came with the product are useless and the diagram of parts doesn't match what's in the box. My unit has a single wire FM antenna that I had hoped to improve upon but the Terk antenna comes with a live and ground wire connection. My unit does not have a 75 Ohm coaxial cable connection so the little red thing with the two wires sticking out (unlabeled) is useless and the connection attached directly to the antenna unit doesn't seem to fit any of my unit's connections. Would be helpful if Terk had specified the connections needed to connect the antenna. This will just go into the trash."
1,worse than a wire,"I used this antenna with the transformer. Regardless of the positioning and orientation, the reception was poorer than with the wire that came with the receiver."
3,Placement,"This device was very inexpensive, so I wasn't expecting much. But it brought in my favorite jazz station which I had lost to static. It is very sensitive and it took awhile to get it in the right place to pick up the signal I was looking for. And so far so good."
1,FM Antenna,I bought this thinking that it would improve my FM reception inside the house. I have a Pioneer amp/tuner that only gets a couple stations. I put this on the system and found no improvement from the small wire antenna that came with my amp. Don't waste your money!
3,The antenna wasn`t that great...,I guess I expected more out of this antenna. I plug it in there wasn`t much differance in sound. I had to end up moving my radio near a window and hang the Terk up behind the curtain. There was some improvement. The good thing was I bought this used so I am satisfied. Jeff
2,Doesn't Do Much of Anything....At Least It Doesn't Take Up Too Much Space,"I figured this item would help me get better reception but I can't really say, there is much of a difference. I would recommend you not buy this product."
1,no improvement,This antenna was intended to replace (and hopefully improve) the reception provided by the single wire antenna furnished with my receiver. It performed miserably. The single wire does a better job.
4,"Effective, small FM antenna","Now I have two of these, placed high on the walls of two separate rooms. Placement is important, because building materials and massive objects between the antenna and the source of the FM signal can disrupt the quality of reception. I've found this small, easily hung antenna much superior to the old-fashioned T wires. Well worth the price. Located in Ann Arbor, MI, it receives Detroit WRCJ-FM clearly, but not the Windsor, Canada station. My car system receives both stations."
2,Useless in my case & product design flaw,"I gained absolutely no reception benefit in attaching this antenna to any of my systems. The first is a JVC receiver for living room, the other a Harmon/Kardon & Marantz in a home theater space.There was no discernable difference between this product and the otherwise useless wire antenna. I wanted better reception of a station located about 50 miles away, but even the stronger signal commercial stations failed to benefit.The design flaw is due to the unit's power wire emerging from the bottom of this antenna. This makes it impossible to set the antenna upright since the wire sticks out enough that it tilts over. They need either a taller base stand to accommodate for the wire, or design a space to tuck it in.While I'm sure many found this product beneficial, in my case it's 1.5 stars based on inconsistent function, exaggerated claims, and misfit design. Returned with pleasure."
3,Mixed Review,I purchased two of these antennas. I hooked one up at work and the reception improved quite a bit. I am able to lock in stations that were not coming in before and not getting any more stations fading in and out.The other one I hook up in my garage at home and did not get any improvment at all.5 stars for the one at work and 1 star for the one in the garage.
2,"Works, But Not Much Better Than $2 dipole",I was using a cheap dipole FM antenna that came with my receiver ($2-$4 typically). I was hoping this one would help with reception to get a solid stereo signal on some of the weaker stations. Bottom line is no help even after an hour of moving position and rotating it. Only advantage is that it smaller than a dipole and not as unsightly. This one is going back.
1,TERRIBLE,I EXPECTED THIS THING TO BOOST MY FM SIGNAL SO I COULD RECEIVED SOME STATIONS...BUT IT'S WORTHLESS...IT DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO HELP THE RECEPTION...SO I THREW IT RIGHT IN THE TRASH!!
1,Didn't work that well,The wire antenna that comes with the stereo worked better than this product. No need to spend the extra money.
4,Good value!,This product is a good value. It has helped to improve the weaker stations on my receiver. I'm sure there could be better antennaes out there but you'll spend more money for them.
1,Worked better with out this Antenna,Dont waste your money on this item. I had better reception before i connected it. There must be a better solution out there
3,Didn't work for my old JVC executive component system,"Over the years, I lost the FM wire antenna that came with the JVC unit, so I purchased this Terk on Amazon. Unfortunately, the antenna provided no noticeable improvement over having no antenna.I'm a big fan of my Terk HDTV antenna, so I want to blame my old JVC system for the lack of improvement."
3,Nothing to write home about,"I bought this to replace the wire antenna that came with my receiver. So far I have not been impressed with the reception. With some tweaking, my wire antenna would receive the same stations just as clear, if not more so. However, I was tired of tweaking that antenna, so now I am settling with this."
1,Piece of GARBAGE!,"I bought this antenna to replace the one that came with my radio. Upon plugging it in, I noticed that the radio reception was even WORSE than the simple string antenna that came with my radio.I think this device is a piece of crap!"
1,does not worth its price,"Hi,I just recieved this item, got it to try to improve reception of HD radio - well, it is much worse than a regular iron antenna I had. No matter how I tried to position this new on ein the room reception was close to none.Do not throw away its packaging as I did - now I cannot return it back.Do not recommend."
1,Don't waste your money,This was my second and last Terk antenna. Works no better than the one that came with the tuner I purchased it for. Not going to send it back because it was cheap enough to just tss in the trash. Going to try an RCA antenna and hope it works better.
1,Junk -- and not worth returning; zero stars,"Reading the reviews of this Terk antenna is a bizarre experience. People have dramatically improved their reception and love this product, or people's reception hasn't changed, and they hate it.I'm unfortunately in the latter category. Worse, even: the Terk actually gives me *worse* FM reception than the standard single-wire that came with my Tivoli, and that's true no matter where I put it and no matter which local stations I listen to here in NYC. Bizarre. Oh well. Not worth the trip to the post office and the return postage. I threw it out. No lesson learned here, because there's no lesson to *be* learned. Just hope for the best."
2,won't buy two of them,just got this (2 days early!) but works not even as good as the two wires I had been using. Looks goodbut I am very dissapointed in use. I have to move it for each station I listen to. Admittedly the stationsaren't strong but the two feet of speaker wire I was using performed better.
2,Not So Sure,"It helps, but not nearly as much as I'd hoped. The wire just gets inserted into the back of my receiver and I'm not convinced the ""connection"" is good enough to get the reception I want. My car gets a bunch more stations than I can receive on my stereo in the house so this is a bit of a disappointment."
1,it's not what I though,"I was very excited wainting for this antenna. But, believe me, once I installed it, I realized that the wire that comes with the equipment works much much better than this. I dont recommend this. The deliver wasn't in timely manner, but for the price and free shipment is ok. Hard to track!"
4,Its Works But You need To know,Connected this antenna to my ONKYO and was now able to pull in stationsmuch clearer. What you need to know is it does not do magic if the station your getting now are off in the distance this is NOT going to help.If the stations you trying to listen to are more then 30 miles away this antenna is not going to help you very much.
3,"Compact, but not as good as a dipole","This unit doesn't work quite as well for me as an ordinary dipole antenna. But if you have limited space and can't hang a dipole on your wall, you might find it useful. It's very small- much smaller than I pictured it- and is pretty stable sitting on the shelf."
4,Decent antenna,"If you already have antenna, this may not be product for you. If you have just piece of wire as FM antenna that usually comes with receiver, then you should get this one. It's nice little multidirectional antenna. I think it works the same or better than T type antenna. So if you need FM antenna and you live in the city, this is the one to buy. You may consider active FM antenna if you need to amplify FM signals. In my case Terk FM+ worked just great."
4,Finally a clear signal,"We ordered this in an attempt to receive our favorite Jazz station without the static that we had been living with the past few months. Immediately after unhooking the T wire antenna and hooking this one up, we got just what we hoped for --a clear, non static broadcast signal. The only problem w/ the antenna, as others have noted, is it's very small base which means that it can fall over easily. That was handled by putting a push pin in the wall and hanging the antenna to it. Good product at a very fair price."
2,WASTE OF MONEY,THIS DID NOT WORK AT ALL.NO MATTER WHERE I PUT THIS IT DID NOT BRING IN RADIO STATIONS ANY BETTER.COLLECTING DUST IN BASEMENT.
5,From static to clarity,"Terk Technology FM+ Indoor FM AntennaAt such a bargain price, I figured I couldn't lose. The hook-up to my receiver/tuner was easier than expected and the quality of sound went from lots of static (we live in the woods on a lake in Maine) to a beautiful, clear signal. I was delighted!"
4,It works!!!!!,I'm very pleased with this indoor atenna. I'm able to listen to all the stations with no interference. I also like the fact that it doesn't take a lot of space and it looks nice. I recommend it!!!
3,"good for local stations, directional capabilities not so great","I bought this FM Radio antenna (Broadcast band) for a stereo receiver I own, it works great for local stations in its omni-directional configuration, but when placed horizontally as the instructions specify (for a directional antenna) it is not all that great for pulling in long distance stations, for long distance stations you would be better off using a set of Rabbit-Ears."
1,No better than a piece of wire.,"I read the reviews and should have listened. I thought it had to be better than the flimsy wire that came with my receiver but NOPE! I have a Kenwood receiver and moved recently where I was getting a little static on some of the channels I listen to. Bought this thinking it would get rid of the static. It does not get any better reception at all! I can put a piece of speaker wire in the back and get just as good of a signal as this. I even tried running a piece of coax up into the attic and hooking this up but it gets just as good reception with just the coax as it does when I plug this into the end. Not worth my time to send it back, just leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
1,"Looks nice, does nothing","Let me preface my remarks by saying that I already had a Sony reciever with a Radio Shack antenna that works perfectly. Then I bought a Sony home theater system and this Terk to go with it instead of the thin white wire that came with the HTIB. The Terk is a no-brainer to install; however, it didn't do anything for the FM radio of the HTIB. When I called Audiovox (manufacturer) tech support, they told me to add another 75 feet of coax cable for it to work. I returned it and bought another Radio Shack antenna. The RS antenna doesn't look as nice, but, it WORKS!"
3,Good but not perfect,"I live in a first floor apartment and my FM radios are in rooms that face north onto a courtyard. Radio signals come in from the south (I'm in the Bronx; signals of the stations I want to listen to come from Manhattan) so my reception was atrocious. If I waved my FM antenna around, I could maybe pick up a bit of a signal, but I couldn't sit back and listen to music or have the radio going as I did my housework or ate dinner or any of that nice stuff. I now have a good signal -- not static free, but the sound is pleasant and clear. The one annoying issue is that the coaxial connection does not fit tightly onto the coaxial FM input on my tuner, so the connection is a bit dicey, but at least I can enjoy my radio again."
3,comparable to old-school antenna - but nicer look to it,don't expect a huge increase in power - but the price is good enough and the looks of it are way better than most classic antennas.
1,Worse than a cheap single wire antennna!,I bought this item to hopefully improve reception over the single wire antenna that came with my new Sony receiver. It actually made reception much WORSE. Stations that came in clearly are now filled with interference. Absolute garbage. Amazon should stop carrying this item.
3,Basic Antenna,"It's a basic antenna. It's a small step up from the piece of wire antenna that my receiver came with. It's not bad for the price though. However if you're looking for a huge improvement, I suggest you look for another antenna."
1,Don't throw away your old antenna!,"This is the biggest piece of garbage, bought two because for some odd reason I actually believed the GOOD reviews on here.Both radios this was hooked up to actually lost signal power with this connected, when i took off this antenna to reconnect the factory antenna,,,i actually had better reception with no antenna than when i had the TERK antenna connected, what a horrible product!"
3,Antenna,We're still not completely satisfied with this item. Not sure it is strong enough to get a clear signal for a FM stereo.
3,TRECK FM ANTENA,I want to listen to N.P.R. when Im home more often. I had a T antena that didnt get me there.This antena is in a windo & better than the T but still does not give me the recption I would like for the station that is 25 miles away.
3,FM Stereo indoor antenna,"If you enjoy listening to a radio that is not connected to an outdoor antenna, this inexpensive device may be able to enhance the listening experience. Do not expect miracles, however. If a station is marginal, it will remain marginal, but listenable. For users who live in apartment buildings, this may be the best answer."
2,Save your money - keep the wire.,"PROS: It works. Looks nice.CONS: Negligible improvement over the wire than came with the system. Takes up more space than the wire.I live in NW New Jersey (Dover) but a hill blocks my reception to NYC. An FM scan with the wire stops on 4 stations. I got the Terk FM Antenna hoping for more, but I was disappointed - a scan stopped on 5 stations. Granted that's one more than the wire, but the station I listen to most comes in better with the wire."
1,don't waste money,"Once again, read the reviews and they said this was a ""great"" antenna"" compared to others avalible...I dissagree! I tried this in several locations at my cabin, but if I was not holding it, it was lousy reception. I ended up putting back up a piece of speaker wire connected to my reciever...don't waste your money on this one."
1,Doesn't work,Simple: No (as in zero) appreciable signal improvement when connected. Save a few bucks and get a tried and true dipole antenna.
1,not worth it,"this thing is no better than the single wire that came with the unit. Can not recommend buying it. Still not sure what the right solution is, but this didn't remove the static I was getting."
3,Just O.K....,"Pros: sylish appearance, no big wires tacked to the wall.Good reception.Comes with adapter that turns out I needed.Cons: The wire that comes out of the bottom does so in a weird way that makes it difficult to sit on a shelf without twisting."
4,pretty good,this is a simple antena and it has definetly improved the reception on my sterio. For the money I am satisfied.
5,Great book!,"This book tells everything you want to know about the show, the characters, and the people behind them. I am still enjoying finding out things I didn't know."
2,Not what I expected,"This book by Sue Waters, must be an early work, the artistry in her woodburning of things like a stone fence are very amature looking. I guess I expected this book to be as well done as Pyrography Workbook also by Sue Walters. I would not recommend Woodburning Rural Scenes, save your money and purchase the Pyrography workbook instead."
1,A SHAM!!,"Those of you who were fooled by the name - well, I'm right there with you!This piece of crap is written by Sue WATERS, not Sue WALTERS.Don't You be fooled, don't bother with this worthless crap!"
2,Not as good,"This book was published in 1994. Her later books are very good. In this book her example of wood and stone fencing were amateur looking. She was supposed to have an example of how to do glass, She had one window witch didn't look real at all. There are some nice patterns but you have to have them copied smaller or larger.There is a bench in one scene that was not proportional.It would help a brand new newbie but that's it.I feel this book should be pulled in Lew of it age."
4,Good Enough,"This was a decent 'Dawsons Creek' novel. I like the fact that both Jack and Andie were included, that is a major plus. In some of these books based on TV shows the charectors in the books act different to how they do on the show, but for the most part that was not the case for this book, the charecters acted very much like themselfs. The reason I give it four stars as opposed to five is that each main charector had his or her own story line until around the last fourty pages. Sure they were intertwined a little, but I would have liked to have seen them together throughout the book. All in all it was a good read."
2,No copy and paste,"Was very disappointed in the writing assistant due to the inability to copy words and phrases from the assistant to Microsoft Word therefore not having to type everything. This is a major problem. I would have recommended it to everyone I know learning Spanish if it had this feature. As is it's more of a hindrance than a help.Also since there is supposed to be some 80,0000 words in the dictionary if would seem prudent to be able to enter a word a letter at a time and have the search engine bring up the words that progrssively start with those letters, thereby saving a lot of time and reducing frustration. This is normal programming practice in most lists.I wrote the company verifying the problem, and I couldn't even copy and paste their e-mail address.This could be a really great asset if it was designed and programmed using standard conventions. I hope it will be republished."
1,300% inflation,This product sold for around $20 in the fall of 2007. Now it is priced at $80? That is 300% inflation in less than one year! There is no way this CD is worth $80. The publisher is attempting to rip off students in a major way. I will not recommend this product for my class again until it returns to a fair price ($20).
5,Changed my Life!,"Stuck it into an outlet then stuck a fork into the other end... Definitely put a little more pep in my step.Considering buying multiple to give away as X-mas gifts. (I'm sentimental that way)*Also, can cut off the female end, expose the raw cables so one doesn't always need the fork to get to the electrical goodness.Highly recommend!"
5,Fantastic viewing,Great T.V. Has wonderful picture quality. Great sound.Would definately recommend to any new buyer
4,Interesting story. I likes the characters.,I look forward to reading more in this series. The characters were like able. Not so silly as some current female detective series.
4,TESS MONAGHAN ** BOOK FIVE,"Laura Lippman's fifth Tess Monaghan book is not my favorite but still very good. Tess Monaghan is so real. You get the mystery and her life, day to day just that makes her real. Lippman does a gret job taking a charactor and giving that charactor real feelings, every day feelings. Love it. In THE SUGAR HOUSE, Tess Monaghan, newspaper report turned PI is investigating the death of an inmate and the mystery goes well beyond a simple prison death. Good Story. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, novel and series."
2,Dissapointed,I was Interested in purchasing this DVD after watching a small portion of the A-1 Skyraider episode on youtube. Since there really is slim to none in the way of DVDs covering the A-1 I figured I would give it a shot.After watching a few episodes I realized that the format was typical and very lackluster and almost annoying at times with the camera effects flashing back and forth. The host Paul Moga seems very fake and scripted when talking with the other cast.A lot of the footage is recycled and becomes very annoying when you keep watching the same footage over and over. The production value of this film is pretty bad.I would have given it 3 stars if it were not for some very damning historical inaccuracies where the host is appears to be oblivious to what he is talking about.I would recommend this to someone under the age of 16
1,Jerry Wallace Greatest Hits - I Don't Think So,"This CD is not only mastered at the wrong speed, THESE ARE RE-RECORDINGS. Can't ANY record company do anything right anymore. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME BUYING THIS CD, IT IS JUNK!!"
1,Unmitigated disaster - NO stars,"Junk like this should not be allowed to be sold. Jerry Wallace, a pop/country singer with more than a dozen pop charted singles to his credit, should not have his material subjugated to this treatment. Most of the tracks on this CD have been mastered at the wrong speed making Wallace sound like a juvenile soprano. Unfortunately, there are no other compilations of Wallace's hits available but even so, forget this. There is a Collectables Wallace CD available but it contains only a few major hits with mostly album filler. Wallace's hits, at this time, are not to be found on any high-quality CD."
1,Too fast for me too!,I agree with them on that this was engineered wrong and his voice is too high. I have an LP with some of the same songs and my analog to digital beats this hands down! I have been trying to find a great collection of Jerry's music but none are out there and this is not much more than trash. When I want to collect someone's music I prefer it original studio unless I'm buying a live recording. Don't bother on this CD. If you knew how he sounded this will make you cringe!
3,Informative.,"This was a close look at corporate London/New York greed within my world of antiques dealing, and it was nice to see comeupance for some amorality, but I'm not sure how much anybody or anything has really changed in the auction world. The stakes are just too high, so probably now the crooks are just more careful."
4,Christopher Mason,"I'm not particularly an art lover and don't go to auctions, but I developed a liking for the author as he introduced the tv series 'Behind Closed Doors', much like the old Alfred Hitchcock tv shows. So when I saw this book, I was drawn to it for that reason. I enjoyed what I learned about the art world."
3,"Interesting, if a bit gossipy","I'll be the first to admit that I read very few non-fiction books... I'm definitely more of a fiction person. But this book was very hard to put down - I really enjoyed the story and thought the writing flowed and drew the reader in. I found the story and the ending very interesting. Though I wasn't always a fan of Mason's somewhat gossipy style, I found the insight into the two auction houses and into the scandal fascinating. I was also surprised to discover how the US judicial system worked - apparently punishing only two of the four players was sufficient. The two that had to ""pay for their crimes"" by going to jail and going under house arrest and doing community service were from the US; the two that received amnesty (or simply escaped the trial by staying in England) were English. It really demonstrated the difference between the strict price-fixing/collusion laws of the US and of England. All in all, a good book..."
5,Dragonball Z : How To Draw 2,This is a great book if you like Dragon Ball Z. You can learn how to draw them. Easy steps to go by.
3,kids love it,"They seem to enjoy drawing from the book. I bought it for them so, I have no issues with it."
1,What is this ...?,"I got books from this series, disappointed to say the least. I have spent a lot of my time teaching my children drawing, and to interest them I got these books... shocked to see the instruction. Who in the world teaches drawing like that. Waste of my money and my children's time (practicing bad techniques)"
4,a book that captures the texture of village life in Iran,"I lived in Iran for 2 years. This book captures the graciousness, the cruelty, the harshness and beauty of the country, its culture and people."
2,Marvelous descriptions but little character development,"Ms Rabinyan can certainly write fresh phrases,and I imagined her sitting at her desk with a dictionary of Iranian/Jewish folklore joyfully churning out page after page of weird and colorful practices. Unfortunately, it overwhelmed the characters, they seemed flat and uninteresting. There was just too much craziness going on. I do appreciate magical realism, but this was way over the top.In the future, I might like to take a look at her poetry."
2,persian brides...not a true depiction of Iranian culture,"The book contains material which I hope the reader does not take to be true about the culture the author tries to depict. It is true that there exist many prejudices and superstitions in the country were the events of the novel occur, yet, as an Iranian woman I must inform you that much of the ways in which the characters deal with the situations are fictional and born out out of the imaination of the author. They are, in no way, a true representation of Iranian culture, Iranian jewish culture, or even that of the villages. I did like, however, the humor of the novel."
1,Blah blah blah,"This book was OK.. I didn't finish it. I got about halfway through. It doesn't have much of a plot and any plot it does have, does not move anywhere.I lost track of characters names and after a while it just became uninteresting.Its disappointing because the culture and the people is something I wanted to read about, but unfortunately this book does not present a plot! So that pretty much rules it out."
5,A Homespun Handbook for Everyday Cooks,"From the creative artwork adorning each recipe to the understandable, easy-to-follow cooking directions, I enjoyed this cookbook from cover to cover. I found that I could make most of the dishes with a minimum of fuss and what's more, they taste great! I would definitely recommend this for the beginning cook as well as those of us who are more accomplished. It was a pleasure to read just for the sake of reading and it also makes a great gift."
4,Alpine Series Is Interesting,"After reading the complete Mrs. Pollifax series by Dorothy Gilman, I decided to give Mary Daheim and her Emma Lord mysteries a try. I have read Alpine Decoy and Alpine Escape so far, and I loved both of them. The books are hard to put down, mainly because of the suspense. The only downfall is how long it takes to get to the real ""meat"" of the story. If you like murder mysteries on the lighter side, this is a good series of books to go with."
3,Not happy with AMAZON,"I would love to own this DVD, (Within Temptation-Mother Earth Live) but my DVD Player will only play a disc recorded with the NTCS format. So what's my problem with AMAZON? If you look at the product description, it clearly states that this DVD was recorded with the NTCS format. ""NOT SO"" It was recorded with the PAL format. I ordered this DVD twice, one new and one used, both were recorded with the PAL format. Ended up wasting time going to and from the post office."
5,Well worth it!,"This is an amazing music DVD for any collection. When you purchase one of Within Temptation Live DVDs, you not only get disc but the heart and soul of the band. They put hours of footage and spectacular performances on all their dvds. It's almost like they want you to get every penny worth and don't disappoint. You'll get behind the scences footage, music videos, live concerts, and hours of W.T. loaded on the disc. This band plans dvds after all their major concerts of every album so far and they spend months preparing the dvds. Trust me, they don't disappoint."
2,total disappointment,"I don't know how anyone can say this is classic Real Life. They changed their sound with this album. No more atmospheric synthpop. They sacrificed that for the techno dance club sound of the late 80's early 90's. God tonight is ok, nothing special. The strongest track, Lifetime, is the only one reminiscent of the earlier albums. By the way, does anyone know how I can find Heartland on CD, please write to me at jliosatos@go.com"
5,Whimsical and elegant,"I love these serving pieces. The design is subtle, but actually very practical. The serving fork and spoon are large enough to handle big food items and the knife handles pies and cakes easily. Not your grandmother's silver."
3,This book was ok.,This book gives you many drills to improve your basic skills but most of the drills take more than one person and they didn't really work for me.
4,A Frog Prince,"This beautifully illustrated book tells the ""real"" story of the Princess and the Frog and was a joy to read to my granddaughter"
1,The bad reviews are true,"Well, you get what you pay for.After reading the reviews and seeing how this is supposed to be mounted I made extra sure to get an industrial strength double sided tape and mounted the unit.It lasted 3 rides, then I hit a bump and the unit flew of my bike, after it hit my spokes.Do not purchase this product."
5,Just Great,For the price is amazing !!! Work excelent. About the moutain system shoud be better. But in overall work fantastic.
3,cadence receiver finicky,Not easy to use. It gets locked in the wrong menu and has to auto shutoff before working properly. Cadence receiver moves about. The rubber bands are not enough to hold it in place.
1,Flimsy Speed Transmitter Mount = DOA,"The mounting system for the speed pickup is incredibly badly designed--it's just an o-ring that wraps around the fork. Not very secure for a part that needs to be 20mm or less from fast-moving spokes. So the first bump I hit, the speed transmitter slips into the spokes, which killed it and wrecked the spokes on a $300 wheel. The computer worked great for a whopping .3 miles. Give this one a miss."
1,Invest in something better - this doesn't last!,"I was looking for a wireless computer with cadence, an easy to read display and easy to use while riding. This did pretty well at first. I got ""blank outs"" on speed and distance every few miles, but they didn't last more than a minute or so. The computer then ""guesses"" at the distance missed and your distance suddenly increases. This adds up over time to an inaccurate reading on a long ride. I was slightly irritated with this quality, but lived with it. Now 7 months after I got it, it's got a mind of it's own. It works perfectly for a while, and then can't find the speed or distance (but can do cadence!) So on a 20 mile ride I'll come home with it reading 4.8 miles. (Yes, I've replaced the batteries, no change.) The odometer reads 35,182 (that happened after I passed the 1,000 mile mark). It's so irritating and frustrating now, that I just use it as a clock and will be looking for a longer lasting replacement. You get what you pay for. Invest wisely."
1,"ALWAYS GOT ""FOREVER BLUE"" OR ""HEART SHAPED WORLD""","I love Chris Isaak. He is the crooner of our time, however this is the same old been there, done that scenario.Just a very weak version of his ""Forever Blue"" and ""Heart Shaped World"" albums.Just skip this if you have his previous efforts, or if you don't STILL BUY HIS PREVIOUS EFFORTS.The melodies, the lyrics, the production are so much fresher, crisper, and full of musical life than this disaster which shows no new life in the world of Chris Isaak.Chris dear if you are listening it is time for a NEW EFFORT AT A NEW SOUND.Thank got I have his other 2 CDs this one is going back to the USED department at Amazon, and I am turning it in for something else.This is a definite miss."
2,Learn from History or you're doomed to relive it,"I've waited for new material from Chris Isaak since 98 and what a disappointment this disk is. There is nothing new here, just take cuts from his previous disks and change the words and you've got ""Always Got Tonight"". Not sure why it took him so long to produce this disk but with four years to create something new and the variety of music he plays on his Showtime series he shouldn't be reliving past glories. Been there, heard it already."
2,"Come back, Mr. Isaak","...I have been a very long time Mr. Isaak lover, but I really miss him. I keep playing this album over and over and can never make it through without skipping through tracks. Perhaps it is time for his show to get cancelled and him to get dumped by his lover - then it's time for some good ol' low(er)-fi 'Forever Blue' kinda sound. I decided to make a compilation CD of about half of this album mixed with about half of his last album, 'Speak of the Devil'. That way, I will have a much better Chris Isaak album. Although sadly, it will still not be the best of his work. Mr. Isaak - go back to the 'Blue Hotel', think about 'Graduation Day', play a 'Wicked Game,' look for 'Western Stars', go 'Round 'n' Round', be a' King Of The Highway', have some more 'San Francisco Days', and be 'Forever Blue'."
4,Give Mr. Issak his dues,"Chris Isaak may very well be the last of the lost-love, love-found, melancholy singer/songwriters who remains cool. An exceptional vocalist, and his ""Roy Orbison meets Dick Dale in a smokie lounge"" persona is absolutely contagious. Always Got Tonight is my 8th album from Issak, and amazingly, this man has not released a disappointing collection yet. His songs of love gone bad, or a new love going good, are never sappy nor silly. When he chooses to rock out, he does so with flair and grit and genuine abandon. A gifted artist, in every sense of the word, this man has been persistant in doing things his way, and that is greatly appreciated by his fans. When one buys a Chris Issak album, they're gonna get a ""Chris Isaak"" album, not whatever the current trendy music fresh from the assemby line may be. I applaud his consistancy, his talent, and his attitude. Thanks for a great body of music (including this album) that has provided years of enjoyment."
4,The Sleek TV Isaak Makes More Music to Cry With,"This album is a departure for Chris...in more ways than one. He opted for a new producer, a few more instruments, and a shiny new blue jacket...to accompany his shiny new sound. After all, he's a tv star now!!Yet despite his best efforts to try and be cool (""Cool Love"") funky (""Notice the Ring"") and slick (""Always Got Tonight""), Isaak is still at his finest when he is blue. No one does woe-is-me like him, as is evident in the heart wrenching ""Life Will Go On"" and the hopeful first single ""Let Me Down Easy"".The sounds are more lush, the style slightly varied, and the packaging is a little fancier, but deep down, he is still the King of the Broken Heart."
1,His worst album.,I like Chris Isaak - and I have all his albums - but I can't listen to this one. It's just that bad. All the other albums have really strong songs - but these tunes are weak and lifeless...
5,poliwog,"Totally enjoyable! Asymmetrical.Makes me wish I could sing & play guitar(thank god for cars & solitary running!).Even the sad songs make me smile - what's that about?My first full album, but definitely not the last."
3,Familiar?,"I love Chris Isaak and I love the minor chords he makes such great use of. However, on this record things seem a little familiar. Some of the melodies and chord progressions all seem to appear ""as is"" on other records. Personally speaking, I really liked ""Speak of the Devil"". He seemed to let go a bit on that record, got a bit creative etc. None the less, ""Always Got Tonight"" is a good CD ... above average in many ways."
5,H-E-L-L-O-O-O-O-O !,"I've been reading all these other reviewers complaining that they've heard these songs before, or that this is vintage Chris, or it's boring, or whatever. Did you not know that this album was made in response to his fans' begging for his early stuff? I, myself, love to hear a band (especially one as stellar as this) that has been together as this long, play their early favorites that are really tight now. Then you get them in the studio, and something special happens. As great as seeing it on stage, I'm partial to studio work, I must confess. I really enjoy this CD, and it's on ""repeat play"" with me."
5,Chris is Back!,"""Speak of the Devil"" was the departure for Chris. This new album is definitely in line with ""Forever Blue,"" ""San Francisco Days,"" and ""Heart-Shaped World""--and that's a good thing! There is lots to enjoy here--""Let Me Down Easy"" is quite charming; ""Notice the Ring"" and ""Always Got Tonight"" are witty and edgy. Mostly, there are songs about heartbreak--and would you want anything else from a Chris Isaak record? If you are a Chris Isaak fan, you will like this album; if you are new to his music, this is a good introduction."
4,"Chris Isaak, as expected...","Chris Isaak has a winning formula: A cross between Neo-Rockabilly and California Surfer Rock with a sensual voice and a pretty face. His fans, of which are many, love the catchy riffs and sensual ballads. He personifies Elvis and so many other earlier Rockabilly perfomers to a T. Except Chris Issak's wittiness in songwriting and unique rock is so addictive, day in-day out!'Always got Tonight' follows his well-traveled path. 'Let me down Easy','Always got Tonight', 'Notice the Ring' (Excellent song!), and ""American Boy' (The opening song for his 'Chris Issak Show' on HBO) all will ring inside your head after the CD's done.Chris Issak's ability to comfortably sell a genre of music some would say is dead is testament to his unique and catchy music. 'Always got Tonight' is an good entry-level CD into Issak's unique Rockabilly-Surfer music and a welcome to his loyal fans. This one is a buy!"
2,Chicks can be dudes too,"I read this book for a lass I was taking. I'd say read it if you want a bunch of short life storys of how ""normal"" women made big money. I am a guy and had a hard time relating so my feeling is that most guys will because the book dosn't sympathize for them. Oh well, you can't always win. Better luck next time. Read Fast Food Nation, it will change your life."
4,How Jane Won,"I liked this book very much because it talked about how these really great women over came obsticles in there lives,and how they did it. some of these storys are really touching becuase it is kinda unbelivebe how these people went through so much but still came out on top,and not all of these people's success comes from high paying jobs most of these people's success comes from there passion for what there doing.This is a inspiring book with inspiring storys."
5,Wonderful Book !,Provides a great insite into the gay community by sharing the struggles of heros in the community. Brings meaning to the word PRIDE !
2,Simon's Quest,"To put it simply, I liked this book. Sure the characters were shallow and underdeveloped, and the plot was ludicrous, but this is a kid's book. I had alway wanted to read the Worlds of Power series when I was younger (you know, when they were first released) and I was always a fan of the Castlevania games. Being a Castlevania fanboy certainly helps, but it's not required, as I imagine most other ""hardcore"" fans would probably hate this book. It can be humourous (something Castlevania usually lacks) and when I wasn't rolling my eyes about something exceedingly silly I had a good time reading it. And isn't that the point of reading a book? To have a good time?"
5,Brings Back Memories,"I purchased this for the novelty of the product. I read this when I was in the 4th grade and loved it. I am a big fan of the Castlevania series, especially Castlevania II: Simon's Quest. Although this book isn't a DIRECT port from the game into written format, it is still a decent alternative and an enjoyable read for the youth."
2,Strap Broke !!!! for $50 bucks they should last longer!!!,Toe strap broke after just two summers of wear!!!! Bought Sperry for the brand quality reputation very disappointed..I guess this seems to be a current problem for this product though.
2,broke strap,"I really liked these when my daughter gave them to me for Christmas...great fit and comfortable. I work in the Bahamas so they get worn a few hours every day after work. The toe strap up front snapped in 6 months and even though I wear them alot, I usually get a year to year and a half out of other brands. They are probably fine if you don't use them much, but I'm going to replace them with something of higher quality."
5,There is no better Flip Flop,I got my first pair of these about 5 years ago as a gift from my sister. I put them on and knew that this was the one. I am always in a pair of flip flops i hate shoes. I have never had a pair and have never bought a pair that fit as good as these do. My first pair broke about a year ago. So they lasted a good 4 years and i am very active in my flip flops so to me 4 years was about 3 years more than any other pair of flip flops has ever lasted me. I just cant say enough good things about these. when i see someone else in them i always make the a comment to them about how great they are and have never herd anything bad about them back. I was so glad to see they are still made and sold. So i just ordered a new pair and cant wait till they come in. I live in Okinawa Japan and its Flip flop season every day of the year here. If you buy these you will not be disappointed unless you live in the north pole and cant wear them!
3,Small - order big,"These seem like nice sandals, and I think they would be comfortable if they fit. I ordered my normal shoe size, but they are much too small to wear. I recommend ordering a bigger size."
4,quality slipping,i wear my sperrys daily during the summer and these have always treated me well. this is my 4th pair and they havent held up like previous pairs
5,Sperry Sandals,These are a great product. They wear well and are made from quality materials. I buy a new pair every year because I wear them so often
4,Sperry Top-Sider,Great product. They fit well and very comfortable. I will be buying addition pairs to make sure I have them in the future
5,Sandal that walks like a shoe.,"Dog just chewed up pair I've had for nearly two years. Still were in great condition, just starting to get a little ripe (smelly). About to buy two pairs just in case they stop making the Santa Cruz. Highly recomend. Also, the Sperry website sells them at a lower price."
5,SECOND PAIR,"Starting year 3 on the best flip flops I've ever owned. Bought a brand new Bichon puppy. At four months, he discovered shoes. I am purchasing a new pair today. Seriously, I have Pikolinos @ $170.00 that are not as comfortable as these. BUy all colors. Keep em away from pups!!!"
5,Awesome,"I have used them everday since I bought them and they have been great. Ex. I went to Busch Gardens Williamsburg, VA and walk around with them the whole day from 10-6 and then some after that and my feet NEVER hurt and I didn't get any blister the next day. I already bought a second pair"
4,Long lasting,"These STS thongs are my third pair over the last 5 years. Are used around the house, beach and fishing. This pair fits tight but comfortable and construction quality is similar to my previous two pairs."
3,Mixed feeling on purchase,"Good quality product but,When first putting these on I thought that the right hand side one feels tighter than the left hand side one dose, so I measured both my feet circumference to find that the right hand side was less in circumference than the left, so I think Sperry need to watch their quality control a little better than that.Other wise I would very happy with the Purchase"
3,Not made as well.,"My husband has been wearing these for years, then they changed them. Now they don't last as long, the strap between the toes keep breaking..."
2,Gift for my brother,"For years I have been buying the Sperry sandals for my brother! He wears them 24-7! Finally convinced him to get a replacement but was disappointed that I could not get the ""original"". This pair, although well made, are not flat but are shaped so that his heel must fit in a concave which for him is very uncomfortable. Wish they would bring back the original."
4,Pretty decent for the price,"Pretty easy to assemble, but some pieces were bent because the packaging was lacking. But I was able to bend everything back into place and it's resaonably stable and works well."
3,Murder at Five Finger Light,"A good entertaining story, as always rich in detail about both Alaskan locales and daily life. Missed hearing about ""Tank"" in this one but still worth the time to read. I'll pick up anything by Sue Henry and always know it is money well spent."
4,Murder at Five Finger Light: A Jessie Arnold Mystery,"Sue Henry captivates the reader from page one to the end of the book. Hercharacters are vivid and engaging. One gets a feel for Alaska, Jessie's lifestyle and her rekindled love affair. I recommend this book. Barbara Likens"
3,Good but...,"Sue Henry is one of my favorite mystery authors. The Jessie Arnold series is well worth reading from the first to the last. But, the truth is that I find this is Henry's least well written book.The plot is promising: Jessie Arnold is invited,along with several others, to visit/work on a remote old lighthouse that friends are renovating. En route, a young woman fleeing an abusive ex attaches herself. Shortly after arriving on the island, the dead body of a stranger is found....and the complications mount.In previous novels, the Alaskan landscape and history are an important, integral, and appealing part of the books. Here, unfortunately, they are awkwardly treated and become laborious.There are too sentences with so many dependant clauses you must read them 3 times to be sure what she's trying to say.Definitely read the book if you are already a Sue Henry addict. But, if you haven't read her before, don't start with this one."
3,A minor production from a usually good writer,"Over the years, I've waited anxiously for Henry novels: I enjoy the setting, the suspense, the characters. But ""Murder at Five Finger Light"" was a real let-down. It was very formulaic (put your characters in an isolated spot and let human dynamics work) and the characters were poorly defined (frankly, I didn't care WHO did it, because nobody was particularly distinguishable from anybody else). The setting was fun (I always like Alaska and whales and eagles) but not worth the predictable and flat ending. My advice to Sue Henry readers: don't ask for this for Christmas. It's a waste of a good gift."
3,Sue Henry is great!,I really love Sue Henry's novels. This one is not one of my favorites but still a good book.
4,Dependable Sue Henry delivers again,"Sue Henry usually likes to do a little bit of travelogue in her writings. Sometimes this can be taken to an extreme, at the expense of plot or characterization (or, in ""The Refuge"", both). However, usually, especially when staying within the confines of Alaska, she's quite good at mixing the two. ""Murder at Five Finger Light"" is such a book.It's also a good example of Christie's ""locked room"" mystery (in this case, ""locked room"" = ""isolated island""). When done right, these can be quite intriguing, and this one IS done right. Although, I should note that it took a significant percentage of the book to set up the mystery. (Exact percentage withheld to avoid spoiler.)An enjoyable ""read"" (although I listened to it read to me on audio during my commute to/from work.)"
3,Not one of her best!,"This was one of the first of the Sue Henry books I read, having tripped on it by accident and bought it because it was in Alaska. I wasn't terribly impressed at the time. For some reason, I found the setting too confining and the characters somewhat mundane. With that said, however, I'm glad it didn't stop me from trying again. Not the top of her form but not a total loser either."
5,Truly awsome,Very nice CD!! Awsome synth. sounds and good late 80's dance beat. Same style as Sandra.
1,Not as listed,"Received only ONE cut-off wheel, not a package of 10 as listed. Sent the cut-off wheel back under ""Not as described""."
4,Tamron Autofocus 75-300mm f/4-5.6 LD with Hood for Pentax SLR Cameras,"This lens works smoothly with my manual focus Pentax K1000. I just need to keep off the A (automatic) focus stop.I noticed a slight amount of distortion at the edges of one picture taken at the 300 mm position, but, generally, everything looks fine.I bought the lens for a trip to Alaska and I was very satisfied with the operation of the lens."
5,There is a PC Angel and her name is Lisa Pavelka,"I love this book!!! I am hooked on polymer clay but have been struggling with it for about a year and a half now. I got this book today. Ive seen Lisa Pavelka on the Carol Duvall show and when I heard she was coming out with a book I couldnt wait! Im so anxious to go home and try all of these techniques for myself. The book is clear and the projects are so easy to follow. I think the garden sticks are such a cute idea and I cant wait to try the heart pendant. Finally, a book that has both advance and beginner techniques. I feel like in the past, I would outgrow my books. Now I can learn some techniques, put the book away and come back to it when I need some inspiration. Thanks Lisa Pavelka for coming out with such an interesting and ""clayer"" friendly book!"
1,Very disappointing,"Sorry, but I have to disagree with the other reviewers. I bought this book on the basis of their reviews, but I really wish I hadn't. There's just not very much in this book. The ""tips"" that the other reviewers rave about are few and far between, and don't really give much useful information. The projects are cute and whimsical, but if that's not your style (and it's not mine), then you won't find much in this book for you. I'm going to sell my copy."
5,A Polymer Clay Masterpiece!,"This book is a cross over for those of us who are not polymer clay artists. I love rubberstamping and scrapbooking. This book is compilation of the different mediums. I used to be skeptical of polymer clay but thanks to this book, I am converted. I followed the directions carefully. I found that each project I made came out fabulous. Lisa has managed to fill the gap between the different mediums and create projects that would appeal to cross over of artisans and crafters around the world. Kudos' to the Author...I hope you write more"
5,Outstanding!,"That's the only words that I can think of to describe this book. I've been using polymer clay now for almost a year and this book I feel will help me achieve my goals at becoming better. The step by steps are detailed, very clear and easy to understand. The photos are exquisite and the projects are magnificient! This is a must have for anyone using polymer clay, or even just thinking about it."
5,Extra Great,"Beautiful book!! Excellent photography....gorgeous/fun projects....detailed/clear/precise ""lessons""!! Highly recommend it to anyone just finding polymer clay!"
2,A Polymer Clay Non-Extravaganza,"I was excited to order this new book on polymer clay, but that enthusiasm waned upon glancing at the projects once the book was received. For the most part the projects were juvenille and some actually looked dough-ey upon completion. This was not the quality or level of sophistication I was looking for in a polymer clay book."
2,not as good as her earlier books,I love this author but i didn't like this book very much. I was so looking forward to it that I bought it 4 months before it came out. I have always enjoyed the humor and wonderful writting style of Lynsay Sands but this book lacked that humor and style. I did find it somewhat funny in a few random scenes. And i will admit that the love scenes are hot but the plot didn't thrill me. The characters were boring to me and the situations that the heroine gets herself into may me think she was an incredibly stupid woman not one who was supposed to be making it on her own. I'm sorry that this wasn't a better book but I'll still read Lynsay Sands books in the future.
2,Heroine is TSTL,"That's right, the heroine of this book is Too Stupid to Live. Maggie is supposed to be 25 years old and running a large London household - so why is she SO DUMB? While the book has humourous moments that I appreciated, historical accuracy went right out the window on this one. I'm not that big of a Lynsay Sands fan that I could overlook so many inconsistencies."
4,A mistake that led to love,"Lord Gerald Wentworth had been Lord James's best friend before dying saving his life. James had promised to protect Gerald's beautiful and virtuous sister, Margaret, but when he found her in a house of ill repute, he was sure she was Lady X, London's most enigmatic wanton. He had to find a way to reform her and save her from scandal, and, at the same time, keep his hands off her luscious curves and himself from falling in love with the temptress."
4,"Sloooow start, but stonger ending... 3.5","This book started out so slow for me. I kept waiting for it to get interesting (per all the 5 star reviews)and, eventually, it did and was a pretty good story. I think the editing was just very bad. I enjoyed the attraction between the hero and heroine and their escapades in the library. This was an average read for me, enjoyable but not knock your socks off good. It could have been so much better but there were entirely too many musings over the same thought. When a book does that, it really makes you want to skim through those long, boring, repetitive thoughts. When the story was ""active"" and moving, it was so much better and it was much more that way as the story progressed."
2,Not enough Kurgan,I thought this would be a better background into the Kurgan character and it was only a few sentences. Totally sucked. Better off just watching the movie.
2,Get the Director's Cut DVD - forget the book,"Since the current weapon of Connor MacLeod is a katana, you would think that the authors might have used the word once in the book. The second time I saw ""Samurai sword"" I knew I should have just watched the movie again.The authors not only botched some of the most poignant moments of the story, but I wasn't impressed with the description of the final battle between MacLeod and the Kurgan.I think the Director's Cut version of the original Highlander movie is one of the best written movies I've seen. Maybe that's why this novel fell so far short of my expectations.If you can get a copy of the script to Highlander, you'll get a much better feel for the themes to the movie - avoid this book!Oh well, at least I learned how to spell pendejo."
3,A must for any real Highlander fan.,"The book seems to be a scene by scene text of the original Highlander movie. There are some additional scenes that finally make the ones in the movie 'click'. After reading the additions, I kept saying to myself ""Now I know who that person is."" The style won't win over the Pulitzer commitee, but to me it was worth the few bucks. If you're a fan of the movie and the series, you've got to have it."
1,"Out of box failure, the base unit does not work","I bought this set online and J&R.; After spending hours hanging the speakers on the wall and modifying the prewired speakers cables in the house, I found out the there is no sign of life on the subwoofer. It does not power up at all. Unforturnately there is no LED to indicate that the unit got power. I called Bose tech support and they indicated that the unit is defective. He suggested me contact J&R; to get a replacement. Called J&R; and they said I had to wait for two days to get a return shipping label, wait for a few days to get the unit returned, and if I am lucky, I can get a replacement unit in a few more days. Since there is a chance for the unit to be out of stock, I may have to wait even longer.Also the unit came with speaker cables with special connectors for the speakers to connect to the base unit before connecting to the AV receiver. If you prewired your house, be prepared to modify the cable connectors."
4,Most of The Best!,"This is a general collection of her 80's Country comeback hits including the #1 hits There's No Stopping Your Heart, Meet Me In Montanna(with Dan Seals) and You're Still New To(with Paul Davis). It also includes a remake, with the original musicians, of her first #1 Country hit from 1973 Paper Roses. She was only 13 then and it's interesting to hear her try to capture that innocence with a more mature voice. There are also 2 new songs added, the double hit single Like A Hurricane and Think With Your Heart. I Only Wanted You was another top 10 hit for her and is one of her best. The CD closes with the awesome song about love and loyalty called I'll Be Faithfull To You. Give it a listen to get familiar with her Best."
4,More Marie needed,"I give Marie Osmand and every country-pop song on this CD five stars. However, I give the CD itself only four stars because it does not have some other classic Marie songs which should have been included here. Let's face it - they can put more than 10 songs on a CD and they should have on this one. Among the songs missing are Marie's wonderful interpretation of Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy, the great Paul Davis tune Cry Just A Little and the 1989 hit Steppin' Stone. Shame on them for missing these songs and others."
4,the best means the best,this album covers all of maries long career and every track down memory lane is a gem a must for osmond fans.if you are not a fan you will be after listening to the best of marie osmond.
5,Marie Osmand,I'm not a big fan but there was a song on this album I liked. I was surprised at how good some of the other pieces were as well.
1,Paper Roses - not the original,"I was very disappointed that the version of ""Paper Roses"" included on this CD is an updated and new recorded version from 1990. It is not the original 1973 classic Marie recorded when she was twelve.Interestingly, this new version is produced by Sonny James, the original producer of the original single, that also features many of the original studio musicians. So all is not lost. Still, I prefer the original hit version and am disappointed there was no indication that this CD included an updated ""Paper Roses."""
1,Not a good read at all,"Like I said. This poorly received book is written poorly, sold poorly and wouldn't interest you at all."
1,VCR drive died after one year,"This box was pretty nice on arrival, although the picture on tape playback was not as good as on my ten-year-old Sony VCR. However, the tape unit has given out after one year. I've tried cleaning it and manually adjusting the tracking, to no avail. (It's the recording that fails; playback of old tapes works OK.)I've heard that all the major labels now buy their VCR drive units from cheapo makers in Taiwan, as part of an aggressive campaign to move everone to DVD. This is unfortunate. My advice: if you have an old VCR, keep it. You may use a DVR for recording, but you may need something to play those ancient VHS tapes, and the new units just won't do it. In other words, these VCR/DVD machines are a stopgap measure."
2,THIRD STRAIGHT REVIEWER TO HAVE A PROBLEM...........,"I'm the third straight reviewer to have a problem with this unit. Mine lasted about 9 months too - then the DVD player conked out! Now I get only a deep, very dark, almost b&w picture, which no amount of tweaking will restore. A lousy 90 day labor warranty too. Spend more $$$ for a quality unit."
2,Durability is questionable,"This combo unit performed as advertised for about 9 months. Unfortunately the video output for the DVD player just died. I can hear my DVDs, but not see them through either standard or S-Video output.So I'm back on Amazon looking for the next unit. Not going to go the combo route this time. I'm hoping the durability will be better with a 'dedicated' DVD player."
3,The Dog Show:125 years of Westminster,"The book seems interesting,but I am disappointed, since I expected the picture, history, some comments, name and breed of each and every single one of the best in show, year by year.Ana Elisei, MDanaelisei@comcast.net"
2,Not Good,"Don't waste your money on this one. It is not interesting at all. Very dull drawings. My eight month is not into this one at all. She likes to chew it and that is all. Buy something else...I definitely recommend ""Squishy Turtle and Friends"" cloth book--provides hours of entertainment for my little one."
2,great concept poor execution,"My seven-month-old daughter didn't really care for this book because it didn't have much substance--too simple and ugly fabric colors. She likes the ""Going to Sleep"" book or ""Dancing with Degas"" or ""Touch and Feel Animal Farm"" better."
2,Try 1001 Steps,"This book might better be titled: ""How To Be Healthy, In General"". There isn't much here specifically addressing mental health. Null goes off on all sort of unrelated tangents. There are extensive lists of what vitamins and nutrients to take, based on various studies. The lists are mind boggling and very repetitive. Null does not attempt to make this information cohesive or narrowed down to the 7 steps promised in the title. There are many typos in this book as well. I do not recommend it."
1,7 Steps to overcoming depression depressed me.,"It is a non-service to treat real concerns lightly.This book reads like a collection of inept contributions - without substance. Worse, it trivializes serious matters in a very offensive way - ie: p145: with reference to a woman at Auschwitz - ""In a small brave voice, she said, Good Morning, Sir""...she was spared because of one life-affirming Good Morning. Yes, positive energy does yield positive solutions.""How ignorant and how insulting! I am sending this book back to the publisher."
3,Some good info but not current enough for the cost.,"This is a collection of articles that was nerver intended to be a book. I would not read that well even if it was still 1982. Most of the information is aimed towards mail order which ofcourse is pretty much dead thanks to the internet. At $10 or $15 bucks its worth while, but for the $80 I paid, I should have taken my wife out to dinner."
4,"Hegel, Derrida and Aristotle","Malabou's book would be a worthwhile book for many Hegel scholars to read. Drawing its philosophical inspiration from Derrida, the book investigates ways in which Hegel's philosophy articulates an openness to the future. Malabou particularly explores Hegel's use of the notion of ""plasticity"" to explore the notion of something the form of which is not settled in advance. The book is divided into 3 sections, on Man, God and Philosophy. The comparisons of Hegel with Aristotle in the first of these sections is helpful for bringing out ways in which Hegel's metaphysics is not governed by a notion of ""presence."" The book bears the marks of being a dissertation, and the interpretive claims are perhaps not quite as novel as they are purported to be, but the analysis overall is both textually and philosophically insightful. I recommend it to serious students of Hegel."
5,Fun Learning,"This was recommended by a friend who bought it for his kids. We LOVE playing the allowance game and recommend it for you & your kids. They won't even know they're learning to add and subtract. This has been perfect for 1st, 2nd and 3rd grade."
4,Pleasing Introduction to World Music,"Schnabel's book has beautiful graphics and is well presented in an easy-to-read format. It is a good introduction to the major figures of world music and fills us in a little on their lives and cultural contexts. My other favorite world music book is ""The Brazilian Sound"" (Temple University Press, 1998), which I also purchased through amazon.com."
4,"Great introduction to ""World Music""","The real pleasure in this book is not so much the artist synopses, which are brief, but in the diversity of artists described.For instance, I've been a Jobim listener for years, and found his section a little lacking, but... I had never heard of Oumou Sangare, and what a joy it was when I went out and bought one of her albums.Thanks for opening my ears!"
5,Good audio...Easy to use,This is a reasonably priced product that meets our needs for our team meetings in a warehouse environment. It's easy to set-up and use and the portable mic allows our leaders and associates to easily be heard during the meetings.
1,Dislike,"When I bought this book I thought it to be humorous, but it was quit boring. Even though I was impressed by the fact that the tales were written into a poetic form, their content was radically modified. I also doubts that some of the are Grimm tales.For me it had been a waste of time."
1,WHAT?,"Never read anything more boring, supposed to be fairy tales made gay? Nothing gay about it but it was grim, never made it past 1/3 of the book, thought i'd give it a chance but it did make me sleepy, better than taking a sleeping pill which is why I gave it one star."
1,Boring,"Was totally boring, didnt like it at all. it really just made me not want to read anything for awhile after."
1,Baahh.,sorry. This book stinlss_Sorry but this book stinked. And.l have no more to say on. The subject. Thank. You.
1,Awful,This was so uninteresting that I can't even think of anything to say about it. Now they want at least 2o words!
3,Ok this is cute...,"I won't say that this the most fantastic written book but it is quite fun to enjoy. It's a book of poems based on some Grimm tales, the twist is they all have some type of happy ending, thus made gay(meaning happy). I would suggest people to read this but don't expect it to be über great, just fun."
3,Not helpful,"This book is well written, to be sure, but it isn't what I expected when purchased. Though not what I looked for, the rhymes were funny and enjoyable."
3,Fun,Not amazing but fun. Would have been epic wen it was just released but today it is lacking compared to other FPS. still fun and the price was def. right for this game.
3,Interesting Premise,At full price this game fails but from the clearance bin it's worth a try. It's a Doom type shooter with off the wall visuals. Things start off with a bang with several interesting moments & backdrops but quickly become dated & repetitive. I got about 8 hours of play in before I became bored with it; will probably pop it back in someday to give it another go.
3,What kills my suspension of disbelief..,"The hero, gramps and Jen are Cherokee right? Why was the Ancestorial Dream World barren rock like found in parts of Arizona? OK, the tribe ended up in Oklahoma after the Trail of Tears, but their ancestors started in the South Carolina. Even when they were settled in Ok. the land did not become barren until the Dust bowl of 1930's!I am very much reading too much into this, but WTF!"
3,didn't do it at all for me...,"i like shooters as much as the next guy, but this one was super-hyped and really didn't live up to it in my estimation. i rented this one and was very glad i did. i gave it about 4-6 hours then just lost interest and returned it. other than running on the ceilings it didn't really open any new doors and seemed a mostly average shooter."
3,Prey-falls a little short,"I thought Prey was a good game compared to most. It wasn't excellent or totally awesome or mind blowing. 90% of my judgement is based on overall experience of previous games. What kind of games do I like alot? I would give four or five stars to games like Doom 3, Resident Evil 4, Devil May Cry Series of games, Onimusha Warlords...Prey falls about 1 star shy. Graphics I give it a 4, story line I give it a 2, Detail in game play would get a 4, guns would get a 2 and enemies would get a 3. It definitely was a fun game to play, it was scarey at times, it wasn't an easy game but, it wasn't hard either. I would say the game creators worked hard at making a good game and that is what they did, a ""good"" job not a mindblowing job."
3,prey? prey? prey?,"had no idea why i bought this game in 2011, maybe it was a moment of confusion or something, lets see if this game`s any good, spend a whole 23 bucks plus shipping on this game. Could have bought gta 4 or saints row series you know"
4,Something to do,The game itself has pretty good graphics and isnt bad for something to do. it does kinda feel like your really doing the same stuff over and over but its not miserable. its worth beating once at least
4,Underestimated; really fun.,I was skeptical about this game when I first started playing it because I didn't know what to expect but as the game went along I really started enjoying myself and noticing what a sharp shooter I was!! I think that the futuristic part of the game puts a lot of people off and all the topsy curvies confuse people but after a while you'll get used to it and start looking forward to it.
3,prey,"Game was alright. I have been trying all the highly rated 360 games. I guess how quick I beat one is the best measure, that is, do I walk away and leave it or play well into the night. It was okay, not Halo, Gears, or Call of Duty. But they all have their drawbacks."
4,Great game...could have been better,"This is a great game, but could have been so much more. The story is epic, the characters are pretty good, the enemies are fantastic, but its missing something. It could have used some human guns, other than the wrench. But overall, I would reccomend it!"
3,Very short game,"Although Prey does include very innovative elements to the game, elsewhere discussed in these reviews, I did find the game to be rather short and not terribly challenging. It's an entertaining game, but I would strongly recommend renting this title versus buying it. The first time I reached the last chapter of the game I thought I had about 50% more gameplay to go (at least). Disappointing considering how much fun the game can be."
3,Nothing new. I knew I should have bought Quake 4,"Except for fighting upside down this game is the same ol same ol.Even though your upside down you dont have any maneuverability because your on a narrow walkway.The whole upside down thing was a good idea but they could have made it so much better. It's a good game playing the first time but definatly not one of those replayable game simply b'cos of the puzzles. Alot of time you want replay a game to satisfy that itchy trigger finger, this game would not do it. It's a good game and all short but good.I would say it's not worth $60, maybe your paying for the graphics. Hopefully they make the next part more action packed with some HUMAN WEPONS."
2,pile of crap,i had rly high expectations for this game and quite frankly the only good part about it was the graphics the plot was dumb as crap and it got so repetitive that it wasnt any fun to play not to mention the online sucked
3,Only If You Like First Person Shooter Games,"The graphics are fantastic, the weapons are varied but easy to use, and the game can be fun for a while but eventually and ultimately it's another FPS game with a few twists here and there but overall the game will most likely appeal to FPS players only. Those looking for more interactive games with character development etc. will quickly grow bored I'm afraid. Rent it before you buy it."
3,just bought it and returning it now,"Quake 4 much better then this, i have seen enough, games that can be released on Xbox 1 should not be released on 360"
3,Just OK.... Nothing to write home about,Let me start by saying that this game is not 'bad'.Its just nothing special... The graphics are good and so are the physics but it is not that long and is very easy to beat. The multiplayer is not very good at all so its mainly the story mode. I really liked the indirect puzzles but I think they should've had more boss battles. There are only a few and they aren't that spectacular. I would rent it first and if you really like it then buy it when it gets cheaper...
3,Not bad for a Halo knock off.,"Rented Prey after all the hype was built up. Shot through 17 chapters of the story in one night. For a rental it wasn't bad. It just screamed I'm a Halo knock off, but my main character is a native american. The coolest thing to me was the possibilities of shooting someone off the ceiling in multiplayer."
3,Meh,"Well, with the level of typical FPS games in 2010 I suppose it's an unfair comparison to look back on a 2006 game and judge it harshly. But, such is my perspective on it. This game is BIG, a fair length of singleplayer game play. But... the Native American theme fails to engage. I'm not sure what the point of it really was. It was kind of an arbitrary ""different for the sake of being different"" type of feature. The weird alien weapons are nothing more than uninspired sci-fi versions of sniper rifle, shotgun, machine gun, rocket launcher. Lots of big alien space ship environments. It's not a BAD game, it's just not an all-time great. It might be worth renting or spending $10 on, but it's probably not one you're going to want to replay. I know I don't. :-/"
3,"Just Okay, Fun For a Budget Game, One Unique Aspect, Otherwise Very Average","At a budget price, this game was a fun shooter for a run through. It has a unique portal element and world re-orienting aspect. You can walk up walls and ceilings on special tracks as the world changes what is up, down, left, and right which is unique. The portals can help you jump to various places and is unique. But overall it is a very average game. I had fun playing it, but have nothing to rave about it or say against it. I never found it boring, but also didn't find it super exciting.There are better games at the same budget price. But if you want a break for an average shooter, this will do."
4,Prey - A new take on an existing gaming style,Prey gives you some new ways to see the environment. The storyline could use a little less angst on the part of Tommy but the environment and action are great. I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of FPS.
4,A game for working adult gamers!,"I for one loved this game most of all because I was actually able to complete it even with the very little time I get to game with, so I ended up with a wholly satisfying experience.The game itself could be a bit more difficult, and I found it's not really about the FPS action, rather than figuring out puzzles and where to go next. Having said that, none of the puzzles took longer than five minutes to figure out, so there's no need for a game guide.My only real criticism is the voice acting of the bad guys. It's way overdone and they sound like some kind of amature actor doing Shakespeare in the Park or something.The dialog for the main character contains a lot of expletives, but you know, I think I'd be swearing a lot too if I was in his situation."
2,DO NOT GET THIS TOY!!!!!!,"I was begging my dad so bad for this toy finnally he got it for me. When I wanted the thing to walk it went about a inch per hour. When I looked in the manual to see why. It said that you have to use it on smooth surfaces, I had used it on carpet. Then when I used it on my hardwood floor it was slipping! Then I tried it on concreat (I think I spelt concreat wrong) and I had the same problem as i did with the carpet. DON'T GET THIS TOY!!!"
1,Roboraptor,The Roboraptor has problems walking on all surfaces. It does not recognize objects and does not avoid them as advertized. It definately is not what I expected for the money. In fact I canceled my order for RoboPet.
5,RoboRaptor ROCKS!,"this thing is so cool! it can play with you and it has feelings too! it can hunt, bite, act as a guard and it can be angry too. when i went to see it the day i bought it, it bit me on the finger and wouldn't let go. it yelled at it and it kept quiet. when i bought mine home, i put it near my door and when my friend open the door, the roboraptor gave a roar. this toy is great. i think people should buy it"
1,This toy will soon be extinct,"As already stated, the description makes you want to get this toy. The possibility that it will hunt you and will run around the house is unrealistic. In fact, I experienced similar problems as the other posters, it can't even walk on most of my floors. Basically, it just sits there moving its legs without being able to move forward and makes noises. It has appeal at the store, but it will quickly become a nice decoration for the shelf. For this amount of money, buy your kid a bike or game cube!"
3,Wasn't worth the money. Wouldn't recommend for kids >13,"This toy walked around the house, turned his head, wagged his tail but other than that, was a real bore and isn't worth $99. This product is worth about $30 and at $99 was a waste of my money.It still works, hasn't broken, so it's durable, but what's the purpose of this dinosaur? it's so boring and my 8 year old only plays with this as an action figure with other dinosaurs. Not for young kids. It's very boring."
4,"Pretty cool, but needs a little work","Pros:-Lots of moods which means lots of different reactions to his sensors-Awesome sounds and roars-Looks really cool-He seems almost lifelike!Cons:-Has difficulty walking, but giving him a push helps-Arms dont move-He can be a little loud-Most ""sensors"" are just buttonsOverall, pretty neat, but not perfect."
2,Raptors are extinct ... Don't try to resurrect them,"Not much of a toy for the money. It works as advertised, but that isn't much. Roboraptor at best waddles on tile floors, but cannot move on thicker carpeting. His turns are ungainly. After a few minutes the ""fun"" starts to wear thin. Not something a child (or adult) could play with over and over again. Reviewers say that it is a lot of technology for the money, but it still isn't much. If you want a remote control toy stick with a car or other vehicle. Roboraptor just doesn't do enough and doesn't give you your money's worth. This will not be THE toy to buy for Christmas 2005. If you must buy it, get it locally and save yourself the shipping expense from Amazon, you will return it after a short time; and it is a bear to repack."
5,cant wait,well i am getting the roboraptor and i cant wait i well make robosaipen fight him the raptor well win so i havent gottn this toy but my bro tryed it and he said it was asome so i think if my bro thinks it is so i will too so i review this item a 9star so well i think u shoude get it: )
2,"Very Good, NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This toy look very boring. I haven't tried it yet, butI listen to other peoples response. It sounds like all it does is walk, roar, and guard."
4,Read.,"Its true that raptor performs worse than robopet, but guess what?It's easier to hack roboraptor. If you like hacking, get this.Otherwise, get robopet. it's hard to hack it"
1,"I actualy think WOWEE wrote these ""kid reviews"" too!","How could a kid know that Robo Raptor is easier to hack than robo pet?!? This just sickens me!!! The sensores don't work that well, it bangs in to walls, and costs too much. (it might cost less now, but back last christmas: 150$. Ya, wow.) I returned mine last christmas, and got 200 bucks :) insted of that piece of...you know what I mean. (My mom would have never gave me 200$ on christmas, so I got lucky.) But my point is...DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!"
4,BUY THIS TOY NOW,this is the best toy ever.i love the hunting mode.you must buy this toy or be forever haunted by ROBORAPTER!!!!!!!
2,"OK, I tried in a discovery store.","But it still stunk! I thought it had KNEE LIKE THINGS! But, wowwee screwed up. It DOES NOT WALK!!! But I have yet to try it with Robosapien V2, which I am waiting for. Anyway, the remote is USELESS! I couldnt figure it out (the robosapiens was easeir, and it had more buttons!)"
1,robo ripoff,"It took longer to put the batteries in than it did for my son to decide this toy was no fun. He was sooooo hopeful after seeing the commercials, but all it really does is waddle super slowly and make an annoying noise. I gave it five stars for durability because it will last forever - untouched! Save your money, you're better off buying a dinosaur hand puppet and using your imagination!"
2,packaging great..toy junk,"This toy does not do many of the things that are promised. Mostly it waddles, slowly, into walls and continues to stand there banging into the wall. Maybe it's sensor are not working. We put it in demo mode and it just does the same thing over and over. NOT worth the money...going back tomorrow."
1,Yikes,"This is my second review of this product - the first one didn't make it through.I can't for the life of me figure out how this product has such a good rating. I was able to get it to walk in place for about a minute and then fall over. Luckily, I tried this out before rapping it as a gift (I returned it)."
5,Everyone in my family loves it!,"Everyone in my family loves it, my sister, me and even my parents think he is very fun. For his advanced technology, his multiple modes and moods, his laser tag and his touch sensors, this robotic toy made me happier than ever!You gotta buy it!!!"
4,"I love it , but not worth the money.","I like the Roboraptor, but it really is not worth the money. I love dinosaurs and dragons. Thats the only reason I want it. But the Roboraptor is cute. It also has way to many batteries needed and the batteries it needs almost cost as much as the Roboraptor. In all I love the Roboraptor but it is too much money and takes to many batteries. (It should come with batteries.)"
4,It's a blast!,My nephew got this toy for Christmas and I had a blast with it! I can see this toy losing it's entertainment value quickly. It walks and growls and stuff but that is about it. It is really entertaining for scaring the cats!
3,Fun but had Big Flaws,"The day I got my Roboraptor I was exited and couldn't wait to open it. I enjoyed the first three days until I discovered that it had trouble walking on carpet. We tried other surfacesbut they did no good. The toy was fun and the way he moved was cool, but too many problems were making it hard to enjoy. I believe that it is worth less than [...] dollars."
5,I love my roboraptor!,"I just got my roboraptor for christmas, and I love it! I am a girl, by the way, not a boy, as most people think I would be. Anyway, my roboraptor is my best friend! He walks on my carpet and stuff, and he hugs my fingers in playful mood! Parents, buy this toy for your kids! They'll adore it! I love mine, and if you buy good batteries, they can last for hours on end! You'll love this toy!I do!"
1,geri-raptor,"i was sooo excited to buy this for my 8 year old. it was the BIG gift that gets opened last because it's the 'best' one. we all anxiously put in the eleven hundred batteries it requires to operate, and turned it on....then, we watched it feebly, agonizingly, sloooooowly 'scoot' across the floor, get stuck in every corner of the room, and fall over sideways. thought 'that was just a fluke, right""? and tried again. same thing. used it for about 20 minutes, and haven't touched it since. my son asked today if we can return it and my husband and i were all but jumping for joy at the thought of getting our $119 back, so we could get him something else. the worst thing about it, honestly, was it was simply embarrassing watching it try to get from one side of the room to the other. like, we felt truly humiliated for the poor creature! If you have tons of $$$ to blow, it looks really cool on a shelf. just don't turn it on. ever."
2,Boring !,We bought this for my 9 yr old son for Christmas. At first it was fun..but the novelty soon wore off. It walks very slowly and is almost impossible for it to turn. The tail is controlled left and right by 2 separate buttons. It is hard to get it going and then its no big deal as the tail moves in jerks.It is very expensive and looks cooler than it actually is. Don't waste your money on this one.
4,It is a toy you have to play with it!,"Great fun for those who still find interacting with a toy fun. It will not entertain you but if you know how, remember how to, PLAY,then you are in for hours of fun."
1,Great as a Standing Toy,Our daughter wanted this toy more than anything the first year it came out. It won't walk on ceramic tile. It won't walk on standard carpet. It won't walk on low area rugs. My husband finally moved a huge plankboard into the living room and we got it to walk. We have half a finished basement and took it down there to try out. It will walk down there; it is very low commercial carpet with no or barely any pad underneath. That is where it has been ever since. I think she has played with it maybe two or three times.
1,The overpriced paperweight,"A few years ago, I wrote a review on Roboraptor (see the rewiew 'fun but had big flaws.') I enjoyed it then, despite the walking problems. Now, three years later, I would like to rewrite that review. DO NOT BUY THE ROBORAPTOR. You are setting yourself up for a huge disappointment! If you watch the commercial for this product, you will notice how attention is drawn to the 'touch sensors.' These are not sensors, they are buttons. This is a major letdown. Second, this toy does not walk at all. It will waddle around without moving anywhere, and mine actually fell over once.I have not played with this toy for 2 years, and it stays in my closet, collecting dust. Whenever I am about to purchase an expensive item, my family always reminds me to consider the 'roboraptor incident.' I spent $100 on this, and though it costs slightly less now, it is still ridiculously overpriced.AGAIN, DO NOT BUY THIS $80 PAPERWIEGHT."
2,Does not perform,"My son received this toy for xmas. It was a lot of fun for about 5 minutes then he realized that the dino could not walk as expected. The life-like gestures are entertaining, but not very long for a active 7 year old. It is a very pricey toy that uses a lot of batteries and does very little. Can I get my money back?"
2,For the $$ this toy is not that fun,"Our 8 yearold wanted this toy so badly for Christmas. He was willing to give up getting anything else just to have this toy. Our son has maybe played with this toy a total of 3 times since he got it. Even on our hardwood floors the robot does not move quickly or very well for that matter. It does a few tricks and can roam on its own. Our son read the entire manual, did all the tricks, and the poor roboraptor is in the closet collecting dust. I would not reccoment this toy to anyone b/c of the price and lack of entertainment value."
2,Robo Rip off,"We had so much fun with another robo toy, the Raptor seems right up our alley. However he had, as others have said here (and I wish I read before buying) difficulty walking on carpet and just sort of scooted around the kitchen floor. While it seemed like it could have been lots of fun, it was just a dissapointment......pitiful."
2,What A Waste!,We were so excited to be able to get this for our boys this year and the disappointment is heartbreaking. It does not walk on carpet at all and on hardwood floors it mainly stands in one placing growling and shuffling it's feet. Totally got discarded within minutes when no one could make it move then when it did move on the patio on indoor outdoor carpet it does not turn it shuffles directly into things and just continues banging it's head on them until you pick it up and move it. My kids were far more excited about the $15 and $20 toys. Way over priced and over hyped. I will be returning this.
4,for all the whiners out there,"I don't know why most of the reviews are saying the roboraptor is a disappointment. Did they expect it to run fast, or chase things? It's a toy raptor, I mean come on! As for what it can do it's one of the best toys ever, definitely worth the price. So for all the whiners out there, remember these three words, IT'S A TOY!"
2,Roboraptor - very disappointing!,"Wish I would have read these reviews before purchasing. From the television commercial, I expected this robot to be ""smart"" and be able to do many things on his own, but he let me down. I thought ""wow, that's really cool - even for a non-kid!"". But it seems only children would be amused by this... maybe. It doesn't walk well on carpet OR hard surfaces. The ""laser"" target thing is a joke. The so called ""sensors"" are actually buttons. The robot is very slow and noisy. I've only played with mine twice. I've read the entire instruction manual and it seems I've made him do all he is capable of - which isn't much. It says when left in demo mode he will explore his environment - yeah, for about 1 minute, or until he hits something. Three good things I can say.. he appears to be pretty well made, the movements are pretty life-like (not that I have seen a raptor in real life!) and he just looks cool sitting on the shelf. (...)"
1,"pretty much worthless..,","All of the ""modes"" do essentially the same thing.It can't walk on carpet, it can't walk on hard wood, it can barely walk on linoleum.The ""left"" control turns right and the ""right"" control turns left.Don't even consider buying one"
4,Entertaining,This Raptor walks and behaves in very interesting manner. It has great personality which makes it added fun. We love it!
2,Not worth the money!,"My husbands parents got this for our son this chirstmas and he had wanted this toy soooo bad. My mother-in-law was able to get it for around $60 because she had some gift cards etc. This toy was not even worth that and the actual cost is way more. It barely walks much less trying to get the dumb thing to run. It supposedly has the speeds: walk, gait & run. It also supposedly has ""sensors"" that keep it from bumping into things. This thing is junk, it wobles and looks like its about to fall over any minute. It will not walk on ANY carpet (I have a very short tight weave burber and it won't walk on that) and my in-laws have hard-wood floors and it doens't walk good on that either. When standing still it does have some neat movements with its head and tail that are realistic but other than that its junk! It doesn't gaurd, or move on its own or any of the things its supposed to. Save Your Money!!!"
2,ROBORAPTOR-FLOP!,"I was not happy with the price of it to begin with, then we had a heck of a time figuring the thing out. The directions are way over a 6 year olds head. The overall outcome was not good."
3,English requirement,"As you like it, as you order it, as you receive it, as you study and write papers about it, it's ok"
2,Sad rant,"I read through this depressing, repetitive memoir I suppose looking for 1) a happy ending or 2) the secret of his ""success"" with women.It's not his writing that makes the book repetitive; he actually returns to the scene of his musical crimes over and over. In the struggling music scene, his connections come through for him, repeatedly.There are funny parts in the book, but overall as he says it's a downward spiral of trying to become a great drummer and a decent guy. Quite sobering.The secret to his constant success with women? He's in the band, and has good looks and charm. Then too, there are a lot of lonely women out there. Amazingly, he does have some morals, but not many. Hook up with a lonely newlywed? No problem.Maybe he loves his seduction skill, but dislikes women?No amount of humorous writing can take the bitter sourness out of this scary and dark tale. On next to I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell.I added one star for his immensely talented brother."
4,More laughs! More sympathy. More please!,"Grant Jarrett indulged in sex, lived a helter-skelter life as a struggling musician, and constantly searched for the missing pieces in his life. He had a pessimistic view of himself, of his relationships with women, and of most people that he met. Having read another frank memoir, Locked Passion of a Free Spirit, of a woman's sexual encounters, soul-searching, and despair, I could not help but wonder what would have become of this 'victim' (as Jarrett refers to his lovers in a joking way) had Jarrett and her paths crossed during that time. Even though Jarrett was quite the lover-boy, I did not despise him. In fact, I found myself laughing aloud at his humorous, cynical remarks and candid revelations, but I also felt empathy for his embattled emotions. Definitely read this book--male and female!"
5,Kudos to Grant Jarrett,"I guess most of what I have to say has been said by other reviewers, but I'd like to add my voice to the choir. Jarrett is hilarious and his book is truly unique. I was most impressed by his ability to express his despair without whining or blaming. In fact he never stops making you laugh, and yet his unhappiness is always there, a silent undercurrent throughout the twenty years he chronicles. According to Mr. jarrett he was never a great musician, but his writing skills are outstanding and his wit is keen."
3,Narcissistic OCD Man-Glam,"Whew! By the tale's end, the moral is pretty clear. And what a wild, awful ride it was.This archetypal dandy has to rank as a world-class obsessive-compulsive: three hours to wash, shave and dress, with two changes a day! These ritualistic ablutions would certainly have intrigued Proust and other celebrated male valetudinarians.A life of shopping, primping and whoring ended up exactly where one might expect -- a telescoping tragedy of ostracism, poverty, institutionalization and grotesque, siphyllitic insanity.Kelly's publishers should have relented and offered significantly more visual material. Snuff boxes and family pictures are great. What would have been better, though, would have been to document visually Brummell's distinctive (if terribly costly) contribution to civilization: the suit.Either that, or spare us the endless, excruciating details of his ignominious end!"
3,Great Cap! but larger than my size!,"Well , its a great hat ...sizing is a problem when it comes to these fitted hats ...some are right ...this one was big ...but got it altered and enjoy wearing it !"
3,NOT for ages 4-8,"Graphics are gorgeous, and the writing is clever and fun. I am giving it 3 stars only because it is rated for ages 4 to 8. The book is more appropriate for ages 1 to 4 unless the child has never been exposed to the alphabet, and it is hard to imagine that anyone reading this review has a 4 to 8 year old who hasn't already had significant introduction to the alphabet. I gave the book to my friend who has a one year old and a 4 year old. The 4 year old was as bored with it as my 5 year old, but the one year old was fascinated by the graphics."
3,I thought it would be better based on reviews :(,"I bought this book for my four year old daughter being it received high reviews on Amazon. I was a little disappointed. About mid story, my daughter was bored with the whole concept and pretty much wanted to go on to reading another book. The illustrations are beautiful and detailed but I think it would be better for ages kindegarten and up rather than preschool or younger. Sorry..."
5,"Very talented singer, I would recommend downloading 3 songs from her album","I absolutely love 3 songs from this album: (1) Good Intentions (2) Lieing in Bed (3) Horses Run. Very good songs. They are a little on the slow side though, but they are sung very well and the tune is gorgeous. I recommend them!"
4,One of the great live recordings,"As mentioned in other reviews, the sound is not the best and they probably had more even performances. But I don't think that's the real point of the recording, or the spirit anyway. I think it's more accurate to say it captures the essence of the band instead of merely a performance.The haphazard recording and playing just adds to the charm. I don't want polished and seemless from these guys, I want a high octane frat party. And this recording captures that in all its glory.I never got to see the band live, Country Dick may well have been dead before I even discovered them and I see no indication they ever came this far east. But if you ""get it"", this is their ultimate recording. It's one of my favorites. When you get tired of polished corporate offerings, give this a try.It is truly alternative, the way it was meant to be."
5,These guys made me love concerts again,"The last time I saw the BFr's was approximately 2 weeks before the big man's death. The show was at Slims in San Francisco. This album has the essence of Beat Farmers all over it...Loud,Plowed and Live. I love it! Can anyone tell me how to get a copy of Viking Lullabye?"
4,A Live CD that does Justice to a the BFers,"The Beat Farmers(BFers) where an incredible live band; this CD does an impressive job of perserving a Beat Farmers show. Their shows where incredibly fun. My only complant is that there could be more of Country Dick's non-song coments such as the County Dick Autographed Condom. All in all, this CD is a good archive of one of the most fun live acts in the last 20 years."
3,Poor performance and recording of an excellent band,"The recording promises much, but fails to deliver. The Beat Farmers are hailed by many (including me) as the best bar band of all time. Unfortunately, the quality of the performances on this album does not live up to the studio performances on their earlier recordings. Likewise, the quality of the recording itself does not seem to measure up. Better options for aspiring Beat Farmers fans are their first two studio albums: Tales of the New West and the almost-as-good Van Go. A hard-to-find import, Glad 'n Greasy, is also excellent."
2,Disappointing,"I love the Beat Farmers. On my headstone, I will have it carved that I saw Country Dick and the boys in concert just a week before he died. They are the best bar band ever. Ever. But this album disappointed me greatly. Uneven recording quality. Rushed tempo. Lackluster quality performance. Get Tales of the New West instead. You'll be much happier with your purchase."
2,BEWARE: Tamron Lenses are NOT compatible with Nikon D40/D40x SLRs,"I ordered this lens from Beachcamera to go with the D40x SLR kit that I was also buying. The lens is nice, zooms smoothly, the optics are crisp, and it does fit onto my new Nikon, but there is NO Auto Focus compatility to the D40x. Beware that the not all lenses labeled ""AF"" are not all AutoFocus with all cameras in the brand line. Only lenses labeled ""AF-S"" and ""AF-I"" are compatible with the D40 and D40x Nikons, and as far as I can tell Tamron doesn't make any of these AF types to mount to a Nikon. Now I have to suffer the S&H and beachcamera's 10% re-stocking fees...don't make the same mistake I made!"
3,Good conventional zoom,"I bought this lens with my Nikon D80 and used it a great deal of the time. Partnered with a warming filter, this lens took nice pictures. It was a workhorse for me until I started doing outside shots at football games. This its slow AF became an issue and I upgraded to the Tamrom AF 70-300 Di model. I also took some close up shots with this lens, but I had to get quite a ways back. This is a good starter zoom, but will show its shortcomings pretty soon."
3,Good lens,This tamron lens is good....for its price. Though I did not know that my camera(D3100) has no built in motor so I use this with manual focus. My fault.I recommend this lens. It would be great if Tamron can come out withsimilar affordable lens with 70mm-500mm.
4,samuel,It. Is very. Good easy to use. Also very clear but very dear to get from usa at. 31pounds. But I got it very quick
1,keeps tarnishing,Necklace and chain were super shiny at first but after 1st month the chain began to tarnish. Cleaned it w/ silver polish and black kept coming off. Would look just o.k. and then 2 days later it would turn black and leave marks on my neck. Don't think the chain is sterling silver after all.I am happy with the pendant but not the chain.
4,Beautiful,My boyfriend gave this ring to me on valentines day and it is beautiful! The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wear a size 6 1/2 ring and he got me a 7 and it is a little snug. Besides that it is stunning! The center stone is a bit on the larger side (which I love). The color is really pretty too although when I am in my house it is a bright pink but when I go outside and it hits the sunlight or I am in a bigger room with more light it is a gorgeous light pink color which I think is prettier! Over all I love this ring and would definitely recommend it to a friend. I would just tell them to get one size bigger than what they think they would wear!
5,For the Man Who has Everything,For the man who has everything comes the Weed Wacker. Oh yes! Now you can own your very own Weed Wacker. You know what they say about people who live in glass houses! Well the same goes for people who live in grass houses. This Narrow cylindar version is a keeper.
1,Save your money!,"As a fan of noir I picked this book up as well as ""Prelude to a Scream""(not read yet) and all I can say is that I'm glad I bought ""Ticket"" used. The work is just...boring. The ending is lousy and I don't have any feelings for the characters in the work. My reaction when I reached the ends was ""so what?"" I hope ""Prelude"" is a better read."
3,Not quite all that it boasts in the title ...,"It was a wonderful book full of great images ... I would say that the title should be revised to read ""florals of the 40's (and other terrific florals of the 20's and 30's)"" as that is what a majority of the book is. Based on the cover and title I would have expected that more than a 1/3rd of the book should have been dedicated to the 50's."
5,You Look Fabulouuuusss,As a graphic artist this is one of those books I really prize. It as good pictures - as a graphic artist I don't read much - so this review if more about the illustrations. And the illustrations are perfect. I will probably be on my shelf in my studio till I die because of the wonderful selection of fabrics. I do like the way the book is laid out too. This book would be very handy for anyone trying to do a vintage look in any type of house.
2,Goof for beginners who want a very SLOW lesson,"I thought this would be better than it was. I am a beginner and know that First timers should not start not with the fast shimmy of the hips we all picture when we think of belly dancing but this was beyond slow. one of her choreographed dances has her moving ONLY her arms for the first 4 minutes, no hips whatsoever. She also seems kind of like an awkward teacher. she knows what shes doing but its like shes reading off a TelePrompTer the whole time. The dvd is not bad at all its just not what you probably think when belly dance comes to mind. its just reeeeeeeeeally slow moving."
1,Eh..,It could have been a LOT better.. It's not at all what I expected. Less talky more worky an everything she did was too lazy.
1,Waste of time,I guess I am in the minority but I thought this was a total waste of time. The instructor could not dance.
2,Really just for absolute beginners.. not inspiring.,"I know im intermediate belly dancer but wanted something at home to keep me inspired for practicing.I bought this DVD, one from AZIZA and one from Saidi.This one was the most uninspiring. maybe good for someone who has never done ANY bellydancing before.. but even so Saidi instruction was clearer, movements more beautiful, shown in all angles.. perfect."
3,damaged CD,"The material on the CD is great , a little confusing bc shes covered up below the waist(should have worn smaller pants). But the real problem is that it took a month to practice to get to the end , the last 2 sections are completed damaged and pause everytime they are played.Too late to return it.Be Careful to check the CD immediatley when you buy it from this company."
2,not for me,"I bought this video because I thought it would be a fun exercise. Wrong. It's a very slow moving lesson on how to belly dance. It moved way too slow for me. I have already given the dvd away because I knew I would never watch it again. I only paid $8 for it, so I don't feel too bad. I just wish it would have moved faster and I could have gotten some good exercise."
1,I can't see it,The CD could not be seen on any DVD player. Presents an error message and does not allow reading from disk.
5,Great for beginners.,I am a beginner to belly dancing. Leila provided very detailed instruction to the moves and easy ways to complete them. I really enjoyed learning from this DVD and practicing it.
3,It's just okay,I played it once but I couldn't finish watching the entire dvd. It's kind of slow and boring. I was looking for something more energetic and sexy but this one is just so so.
2,Too Slow.,"Don't get me wrong, I am certainly no pro at belly dance, but i feel like this was wayyy to slow and boring. I like my dances to be exciting and enthusiastic."
2,Poor Quality,"I dont know much about bellydancing but I know that the lighting on the dvd was not good on my eyes, and the instructions given wasnt as clear. I looked at other videos after this one and I think the whole set up was not good. maybe the price should have been less."
3,OK,There is a lot of down time with the introductions (which has no activity) and slow to get into an actual workout. I will need to have more time to memorize the moves.
5,Wonderful,"If you have ever wanted to try Belly Dance, this is a perfect selection. I had been considering to do it for awhile and after some looking, settled on this one two months ago or so. Since then I have been learning and having fun.She is really good at showing you how to do things with examples that are easy to understand. The presentation works well as she shows things from all sides when describing what to do, such as how much movement is needed. Very warm personality that is realy enjoying showing me how to Belly Dance."
3,"It`s okay, but not what I was looking for","It`s okay, but not what I was looking for, I wanted something more dynamic, more movement, here I found myself just listening to instructions instead of moving along."
4,Wonderful Course,I liked this product. Easy tutorial to learn the moves and it really works your core and arms. Love the music. It sets a calm and ambient setting. Wonderful if you want to learn belly dancing.
5,Gift for girlfriend. Love it.,Very easy to follow instructions and entertaining. Never boring. I am enjoying the results of girlfriend's interest.Many different dances and good progression from no experience and upward.
1,"don't waste your money with this dvd, it's useless.","I think I can teach the woman on the video a few things, she sucks. This purchase was such a waste of money. You will not learn anything, you are better of looking up youtube videos because you will learn a lot more."
1,didn't like it,"I've taken a bellydance class before (6-8 wks) and I was so disappointed. Nothing made me say ""ooohh I want to learn to do that"" so I am very disappointed & I don't like to waste money. This was a waste. I feel every dance teacher should be fit and her tummy was a huge distraction."
2,Mary,"Any person would like it if they never seen a really belly dance girl. My sister inlaw belly dances and the really work at the hips, and sheak it!! This girl is barely moving her hips! If you see real belly dancers it different then this women! I dont like her style."
1,I can't see the DVD,"I am very sad because I can't see the DVD, I don't know what happend because I put the DVD in my computer, in my home thether and nothing... I lost my money!!"
2,for the slow beginner,"This is very slow, and good for the very beginning student. But it is a bit boring. I find that it didn't hold my interest.So, I haven't used it much."
1,Don't Buy It!,"I watched this video last night and I was extremely disappointed. It's so low budget it isn't funny. For starters, after every segment you're routed back to the menu and have to choose where to go next, which is really aggravating! Also, the instructor talks WAY TOO MUCH, over-explaining things like she's talking to an audience of 4yr olds. I was so bored and uninspired, that I stopped watching in the middle of the 2nd segment. And finally-- a petty critique, I admit-- the instructor has a big hole in the underarm of her top, which really irked me for some reason. It's like the producers and the instructor didn't even try to create a credible video. This only cost me $6.99 + $3 shipping, but it was a complete waste of every cent. I'm donating mine to Goodwill."
4,Great Instructions,"I am not a bit disappointed in this CD by Leila. I have always wanted to learn how to belly dance and Leila's instructions make it easy to learn. I also have realized, it's easier than it looks. Great exercise."
4,Great for a beginner like me!,"I've enjoyed a little bit of belly dancing in my zumba class, but wanted more basic instruction. You don't always know what you'll get when you order something like this, but I have to say I am very pleased & enjoying this dvd. Leila is a lovely woman with a pleasing voice & manner about her...she makes a woman feel good about her body, no matter what size, in fact, she explains that having that little extra can be beneficial in belly dancing. The main thing I like is how she explains the moves, she really knows how to explain in a way that simplifies & sticks with the student.I loved the music so much that I have just bought two of her belly dance music cd's and look forward to practicing to these as well. Thanks to Leila for a great dvd!"
4,Belly Dance for Beginners,Belly dancing isn't easy but this one helps youslowly get the hang of it. You do move a lot ofmuscles and body parts. You can really feel itand it is fun.
3,Its ok,This a good video but its kinda boring. I thought it would be a little more exciting. But she is a good teacher and she makes it easy for you to get.
3,Belly Dance For Beginners,The instruction was easy to follow after a few times but I found the instructors voice annoying and made it hard to concentrate.
3,Belly Dance,I probably will give this one awayIt's too slow for me and the woman talks too much. Just show how to do it and be quiet
5,Great teacher,"This instructor is one of the best I've found on DVD. I took a few classes at our community center and have since bought a few dvds to learn at home. Her teaching style is easy to follow and very casual. She starts slow and breaks it all down, then goes a little quicker. She also demonstrates the move on both sides. When you have mastered all the various elements you can follow her in a couple dances or make up your own."
5,fun workout!,I love this DVD! The workout is fun and intense. Leila explains everything in extreme detail in the tutorials so you won't get lost. I definitely recommend it! I'm starting to feel like a pro!
5,Belly Dance For Beginners,"Egyptian style Belly Dance is a form of dance I had not tried before, but was interested in. I have heard of Leila before and thought this was a good opportunity to get some instruction from her since she is so highly regarded as a teacher and she lives up to her reputation here.Everything is presented clearly step-by-step then at the end of each series of movements you put them together. Worked very well for me and her interviews and introductions in each section provide some good tidbits. The section describing the background of Egpytian Belly Dance was interesting to hear.If you are interested in Egyptian Belly Dance, or even learning some form of Belly Dance in general, this should be something to get."
5,Great Workout/Moneysaver!!!,"Why pay for bellydance classes when you can rack up on dvds? This is a wonderful and fun way to shead the pounds. She is very skilled but doesn't go above your head. These moves increases your awareness of your body. I moved muscles I didn't know I had,lol!! This is a great investment."
4,Awesome easy belly dancing instruction.,This is an easy to learn belly dancing DVD. It goes slow and and it is great for beginners. Each section is explained with step-by-step instructions for easy learning and practice. Very soothing exercise.
4,Good for starters,"It is a very good video for belly dance beginners. I liked very much the step by step lessons, makes much more easier to learn intro belly dance. Good buy!"
2,English majors beware!,"Pospesel likes to mess with your head. He uses horrible, gramatically disastorous sentences that he wants the reader to distill into logic proofs. If you find this sort of thing fun, well, have at it! But I'm an English major and I want to get out a red pen and start correcting the run-ons, redundancies, and obfuscations. This book is the reason I withdrew from the class!"
5,The Britney Game,I am a not huge Britney fan this is really a nice game after you dance you collect a video from the video vault which you can move a 360 degree camera which you can zoom in and out this is like Bust a groove. Well I say I give it a Five. Even other people who are not britney fans will like this game so get it................
4,A solid upgrade,"A solid upgrade from my Delta 011-090 Drill PressThe table adjustment crank could be smoother, it tends to jump a little, but is a vast improvement over there not being a crankThe table leveling could be better, I used a digital angle gauge to adjust to zero tighter then the Delta procedure called for.The manual is clearer then many recent Delta manuals (like the 31-255X)The laser centering is nice, but certainly not a requirement, it's a little gimmicky."
4,Regular Guy,The assembly instructions were clear and easy to use. The drill press is excellent with plenty of power and table area. The laser is a gimick; and could use a focus adjustment to sharpen the lines. Be prepared to build a stabilizing base out of plywood if you don't anchor it to the floor. Definitely worth the money...:)
2,Made in China?!?! WTH?!?!,"Fortunately, I received this as a Christmas gift but was extremely disappointed at the Delta 'quality'. One simple example is the table casting which, is substandard, to say the least!! One side has a large casting blemish. I had to use a rat tail file to round finish rounding the slot ends and a bastard file on the edges to keep from getting cut. This is allegedly a 'DELTA'... a Company in Tennessee, right?!?! Wrong... this damn thing was manufactured in China and it truly shows. I realize many products are manufactured in China but fine woodworking machinery should not be one of them. Buy it if you want but for my money, I will look elsewhere... even if it means spending more."
2,Wish I hadnt bought it,"I have lots of Delta tools and this is by far the worst one. The crosshair laser is pointless. The pulleys and motor were out of alignment from day one. The belts are too fat and even though the pulleys are now aligned (1 hour job) they shred black stuff constantly. Huge chuck is poorly machined. Very stiff. Drill key fits poorly, is not sized correctly and only works in 2 of the 3 chuck holes. Changing speeds is a pain in the butt. Top cover rattles. The toothed strip that runs down the side of the stand bent like a paper clip when someone didnt loosen the lock enough and tried to lower the table. The drill stop gauge is sloppy, hard to use, and looks as though it will break if you tweak the tin thumb screw too much. Directions were in basic Engrish. 2 outlets are needed, one for the light and one for the motor. C'mon this is Chinese junk not the Delta that I used to trust. Not rugged, not a quality machine, No bargain after all."
4,16.5 - INCH DRILL PRESS,"For it's price, this is a good heavy duty drill press with features only found on much more expensive equipment. Assembly was fairly easy except that I had to use my tap and die set to clean out several threaded holes and the machine screws to assemble the table and related components. Casting on the table is poor with edges rough enough to cut me and metal under grooves in table with voids. I'm very surprised that Delta does not have better quality control on this."
4,"Pain to assemble, but works!","Well, the work platform weighs about 40 lbs., and I think the drill head about 100 lbs., but once it is finally assembled, it works just fine.Looks like an Alien in my garage. Altered the belts, and started drilling holes in wood.The laser isn't really working out. Not sure how accurate it is supposed to be.You can adjust it by hand around center, but better to use another method to hit your spot."
1,This book is badly written & is a disgrace to other novels.,I think this book is the worst I have ever read. It lacks creativity and good writing skills. This book is for people who much prefer to read books with horrifying plots.
5,Zen Wall Charger,Very helpful on those long trips or when taking a flight. Just plug into a wall outlet and no need to pull out the laptop.
5,Should be included,"Creative used to include an AC charger with the Zen, right out of the box. For some reason (to save money), they stopped. That's a shame, because the difference in speed this charger has over plugging the player into the USB port really is astounding. It takes two hours or less to get from a dead battery to a fully charged one with this charger, and, as someone else mentioned, it's a dedicated charger, meaning the adapter is attached, and you don't need to worry about the USB adapter. That's a small touch, but it's nice for those who are prone to lose things.There's not much more than can be said about this, since it's just a charger. I will say, however, that I ordered it the day after I got my Creative Zen, and I've been more than satisfied. Creative really should continue including one with the Zen."
2,Yeah but... No But... It's great BUT only if travelling WITHIN the United States,"Delivery was swift, and there was no need to contact SF's customer service.However, the `Zen Travel Adaptor' was not what I expected. It clearly states on the package that it's a travel adaptor ""suitable for world travellers""; which is not the case especially when there's only the US AC plug. There are no other plugs for any other countries. I understand that I can purchase an adaptor but that was the whole point of purchasing this item.I'm chalking this up to as an honest misunderstanding, seeing that I didn't notice the other reviews until after I purchased and received the adaptor. I spend a lot of time in and out of Europe and need a versatile charger as the AC plugs vary from country to country. When travelling outside of America, if you already have a universal adaptor to attach to the Zen Travel Adaptor, it will work fine."
4,"Works Great, Dirt Cheap","Works great. I had purchased a previous charger that supposedly fit and it never did. But I marked it off on the ""you get what you pay for"" list. This, on the other hand, is cheap AND works, fits my 30GB Creative Vision M perfectly."
4,"Good, except for annoying noise.","It works even better than the USB charger. It charges faster and you can listen to the Zen while it's charging. However, when I listen to it while charging, I hear a high pitched buzz that is somewhat soft but still audible.On a final note, the picture isn't what I got. The charger in the picture is much bigger and bulkier than mine..."
4,What a bargain!,I recently bought this travel wall charger and I am very satisfied with my purchase. I have not had any problems with it and the price was a steal. I hightly recommend this product.
4,Zen Vision M charger does what it should,"This charger works great with my Zen Vision M. Have not had a problem. Something that would make this better would be to have some type of case to keep it in to protect the connector, but for now I am using the box it came in."
5,Excellent product-- a must-have.,"If you have a Vision:M, then you need this charger! I'ts so much easier and faster than using the USB, and you can listen to music while it charges! there is a slight buzzing noise if you listen while you charge, but other than that, it's wonderful. I bought 2, and they both work perfectly."
5,Great charger!,"Product arrived very quickly without any problems. It's a great charger too! It charges my Zen fully in about an hour from being discharged. Another great thing is you can just plug it into your Zen without needing the adapter which can be an inconvenience especially while traveling. If you're looking for a charger for your Zen, this is definitely it!"
1,Does not work,"Only paid a little over $6,00 for it so didn't think it was worth the money to send it back for replacement."
4,Works for the Zen Vision W as well.,"I've not had it long enough to fully rate it, but it seems to work fine. I have a Zen Vision W. Though not listed in the product descriptions, it does work fine for that player. For $5-$6 (almost all of it's the shipping and handling), it's hard to beat."
4,Zen Vision:M Travel Charger,A very simple charger.Cheaply construced but a very low cost option and very practical when on the road and have no access to your computer.
1,didn't fit,"didn't fit my vision:m. it was slightly too large. the product manufacturer was fosmon. waiting to hear back from the seller (sf planet). the price was good (79 cents), but not worth it if it doesn't work. so beware - this might not work for you. i would have given it zero stars but i had to give it at least one.i will update the review as the saga unfolds."
4,A day late,"I ordered this on a Sunday hoping to receive it by the following Saturday for my trip to Colorado. It ending up coming the Monday after I had left which is still good, however, not convenient for me. The product seems to work well and doesn't take long to charge my Zen. I am happy with this purchase."
5,Does the job,It does the job. Charges my MP3 player from the wall so I don't have to tie up my computer.
4,Bit of a tight fit,I was a bit worried that I got the wrong adapter because it was a very tight fit... but the item works great. You can charge while using your Zen. Charges way faster than the USB cable. Creative should ship with this charger in the box I would pay the extra 15 dollars well worth it. I rated the item a four just because I am a little worried about the tight fit. Happy holidays
1,"Used item, not new.",Seller posted this item as NEW. But it is not NEW. It was not factory sealed. It didn't had any manuals. Dont buy this item thinking it is NEW.
1,watch out for this seller,"Emailed seller 2 times no reply, still have not received product.would not recommened to buy from."
5,A lire aux petits enfants comme aux grands,"Utilisé dans certaines maternelles comme livre de thème, ce livre ne peut que ravir les enfants qui aiment les animaux.Illustrateur : Frédéric Stehr a su donner à Calinours une attitude bonhomme, douce et cline qui va bien avec son nom.

5,"There's no other cd like this, because there's no other Curtis V. Magnificent!","Curtis V. is an original, man. Nobody puts words together in the spoken word like he does, and nobody as smooth. And with Ron Smith, former guitarist for Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, they both bring a sound unheard of. A cool collaboration. This cd deserved more attention when it was released . . . I suppose it's not too late, that's where I come in."
3,Personal Story,"This book tells the story of MacNeil's childhood and his lifelong fascination with words. MacNeil's parents came of age in the late 1920s in Halifax, Nova Scotia. They started married life together just as the Depression hit. MacNeil's father commanded ships for the Canadian equivalent of the Coast Guard. During much of MacNeil's childhood, he was away at sea, and young Robert MacNeil was expected to follow in his footsteps when he graduated high school. However, Robert was drawn more towards books and literature, having developed an ear for literary expression at his mother's knee, as he listened to her read stories like Peter Pan and Treasure Island. It was his ear and love of enunciation that led him to a career in theater, radio, and eventually television broadcasting. In this book, MacNeil shares with us many of the influences on his early life and career, and enumerates some of the many books that he enjoyed experiencing as a child."
5,"""Pixie Dust""","This malodge (Chicago spelling) of spices (MOS) is unique in the culinary world for ""being arrived at PRIOR to the dish that it was birthed for: Fried Rice! But whatever, it IS quite great. I wouldn't go to the trouble of preparing the meal without a packet of this ""pixie-dust"", to sprinkle thereon."
4,Good follow up to Unwritten but...,The second album is never as good but in the case of NB there's a good reason. Natasha's first album was never out of my CD player or my Itunes playlist. NB is growing on me - slowly. But whereas her first album was very 'her' this one seems to have the heavy hand of the record label all over it. I like the songs and her distinctiveness is still there but why release different versions of the same album in the US and Europe. Record company profits! I recommend buying NB - the import - and downloading the songs from Pocketful of Sunshine off Itunes. Hopefully the label will leave her alone for album number three.
3,"This is odd. It's a combo of not 1, but 2 albums!","Hold it! This is obvious. How can Natasha do this to us? This album, if I can explain this long story short, is awkward and so off track. I mean, look at this: Tricky Angel? I think They're Thinking? That, in my case, is not like Unwritten and Pocketful of Sunshine, which are the real gems. This kinda looks like a cd I never will pick up."
4,A long lens,"First off this is in no way a compact lens, its big and its heavy, but it does produce very sharp and detailed images under the right conditions.I am using this with my Sony A200 and it performs well on a tripod, but for handheld success it better be a very bright sunny day or a very high ISO setting because this lens is very difficult to control at extreme telephoto lengths. My Sony begins flashing the warning sign in the viewfinder at 200mm, but to the cameras credit the steady shot performs well. That being said I would suggest that this lens be used with a tripod.Bottom line, for the cost this is a very nice lens. It is louder than the Sony or Minolta's, and it does hunt a bit at extreme telephoto (partially I beleive due to camera shake induced by it's weight) but all things considered the build quality seems, to me at least, to exceed the Sony kit lens."
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,I use this with both the A55 and A300 and love it! Recently used it at my brother's high school graduation and was able to get some great shots of him even from the stands. For this price you can't beat this lens! Highly recommended!
5,Surprisingly good,Tamron has been around a long time now and have learned to make some great lenses. I swear this lens is sharper than the kit lens on my A77. I just cannot believe it is so cheap!
3,Product is Good and I like the price.,This Product is good and I paid comparitively less price for this. So I am Happy to have this product with me. Lens quality is equally good when I compare this to high price lens.
4,Does the Job!,"I was worried this would not fit my Sony A290 DSLR and I'd be forced to buy an adapter, tec. etc., but it fits, it works and I'm satisfied. Although I have used it sparingly so far, I'll update my review after I get a chance to use it to it's full potential."
4,Great lens!,Great lens for the money! Quick snapshot and good quality photos! Used for sports pictures and it worked great! Would recommend!!!
5,tamron 300mm lens,The tamaron 75-300 lens more than met my expectations. The pictures that I took were of very good quality. I am very happy with this lens and also with the seller.
3,For the curious,Or twisted. Details what some guy did to someone else. But does a poor job of explaining the phenomenon. I want to understand.
3,mediocre chick flick,"While I don't want to minimize the subject matter, this movie is definitely engineered to be a heartwarming, feel good movie. Of course, I knew that before I watched it but I don't mind these types of movies if they do a good job. This one was slow in many places with a predictable ending and some predictable plot elements. the acting was done pretty well, but not great. I wouldn't recommend this to a guy, but this works for your average chick."
1,What is it?,"Look, they don't tell you what it is or what it does, no stats, performance ratings or whatever, and the thing costs over a mil? Were I expecting someone to hand me well over a million dollars, I sure as shootin' would give a picture, description and stats on it. But that's jes me, a regular ol' consumer down here in the lil' ol' South."
1,Unnecessary for radiant panel,"All info on Radiant panel ordered did not say it comes with a self stand. This Panel Stand was advertised as an accessory to the panel I ordered. Was not needed, am not using. Too expensive to return. Buyer beware."
5,Best Batteries around!,"I have been in the Wedding Video Industry for over 23 years now. We only have bought Bescor batteries & lights for my studio. They are simply the best for design, power & lasting.We have turned many other studios on to these guys as you won't be sorry for purchasing their products!!"
2,Warning: Miscommunication between Amazon and Seller,I just bought this item but the seller sent me the MM9 battery WITHOUT any charger!
3,ONCE UPON A PIRATE SHIP,THIS BOOK LEFT AN ENORMOUS IMPRESSION ON ME AFTER 18 OR SO YEARS I STILL REMEMBER IT WISH I COULD FIND A COPY OF ITTHX FOR THE GREAT BOOK
3,Washing kit,"All in all a lovely kit with everything necessary for a gentleman's grooming when he travels. I was just sorry it, like just about everything else in this country, was made in China. It was not ""cheap"" and I had hoped it was made in the USA. Shopping on the internet often prevents one from knowing the country of origin of purchases so in future I will either ask or simply not buy."
3,Inconclusive,Normally I would have given this book 4 stars BUT too many scenes could be called repetitive - characters never really did much AND there should have been a sequel or a better ending.
1,"Beware the ""rear break / footing"" system of the Walklite Walker 6300.","I received my first ""Walklite Walker 6300"" in April 2012. It was purchased through Medicare. I called the Company that my physical therapist used. The name on the label.As of the middle of September 2012 my rear plastic walker footing / rear breaking system wore out to the rear two metal legs until the rear legs were slowly wearing away.Unfortunately I cannot receive another walker for another 4 1/2 years through Medicare.called the Company that my P.T.used. They informed me of the above information. However they would ""repair"" my rear legs for a total of 209.96. I have the breakdown but it's too long to go into.I looked at another company online, unfortunately it was not Amazon. I paid a total of $167.46 for another walker exactly the same. Amazon's price was a lot less.Unfortunately there are predatory companies out there looking to prey on seniors.This was a lesson I learned.GO TO AMAZON FIRST TO RECEIVE THE BEST PRICE.WaltCT"
5,The Best Pilot for a Series that Fox-TV ignored!!!,"Multi-layered and complex, this film blurs the lines between real and reality. The ending is unexpected, and opens the door to a very interesting concept. Too bad FOX-TV has no faith whatsoever in the American TV audience. This would have been an awesome series!"
2,Horrible!,"Now, first off, I love BSG, have all the discs. I picked up Virtuality when I went to buy The Plan. they were having a deal where if you bought The Plan you could get Virtuality for only $5.00! So, since Moore was involved in it, I figured its probably pretty good. Boy was I disappointed.This movie is one of the WORST I have ever seen! It takes forever before one even gets faintly interested in it. Im sorry, but it is a total waste. Thank God I only wasted $5.00 on this junk. It is an extremely boring movie. I tried to see the good in it, but its a waste of time. Its like a cross between Big Brother & Survivor in space! The plot is silly, and SPX are no better than 20 years ago.Dont waste your time in this movie.This movie is one I will literally throw in the trash! I dont see how anyone can give this movie more than 2 stars at best!I guarantee it will put you to sleep within a half hour!"
3,It's an okay movie,"I bought this movie to see a particular actor (Jose Pablo Cantillo) since I like watching him on screen. :-) Crew members on a space mission can escape to a virtual world of their making to help deal with the stress of being in space. It's an interesting idea that could have been explored in a deeper way to make it more terrifying. I read at one point that this was a pilot for a TV series that never went past the pilot. Again, a remake with the intent of being a movie, rather than a series, could be really good."
4,great guide to a importer of mexican pottery,"as an importer of mexican pottery I have been to most of the places depicted. The book is great,. factual, I need a copy to find new areas to import from for my mexician pottery business. however the book does need to be updated as it does not refelct the expansion of new styles and new locations of pottery in mexico."
5,"Practical, easy-to-read,lots of great tools, tips and guides","Volunteers: How to Get Them, How to Keep Them, by Helen Little, is a creative and practical book, full of innovative information, tips and tools on how to recruit, manage, train, evaluate motivate, and inspire volunteers. Ms. Little outlines the twelve basic needs of volunteers and shows step-by-step you how to meet those needs, ultimately helping you build and retain a successful ""volunteer management team.""Anyone who has been involved volunteer management soon learns that volunteers work most successfully when the job is clearly defined and when volunteers clearly understand their roles and responsibilities. This book has lots of useful and infinitely usable examples, templates, and guidelines to help you you ""hit the ground running,"" and successfully accomplish the goals and objectives of your program and/or organization. A ""must read"" (and an easy read) for anyone involved in the care and feeding of volunteers."
2,False advertising,"As a new Outreach Coordinator for a small non profit, I am looking specifically for information on how to recruit volunteers. The title suggests this book is the one, and other reviewers found it helpful. But, I'll just say, it is not about recruiting, it is about managing volunteers. After a very short Chapter 1 discussing the ""myth"" of the volunteer shortage, the author tells us ""the remainder of the book is dedicated to helping"" us recognize and meet the needs of my volunteers. Humm, a very misleading title! I wish I had found it in the library, then I'd have known it was not the book I needed without paying for it."
2,"You don't need this book, I promise","Unless you've never been a volunteer, never worked with a volunteer, and/or never heard of the word ""volunteer"", you do not need this book. First, this should cost about $5, as it is essentially an overgrown pamphlet. It contains great insights like ""get name tags!"" and ""seat people with vision trouble near the front"". Really?!?I have no idea why the other reviews were so high. Maybe those of us in non-profits are too nice... I don't know... but I guarantee that no one with previous experience in volunteer management found this book worth the purchase price."
4,B. Fleischmann - The Humbucking Coil,"Shoegazing has never been far from electronica's heart, and on THE HUMBUCKING COIL, B. Fleischmann brings the two even closer together. ""Broken Monitors"" has the hazy atmosphere that has brought Ulrich Schnauss so much notoriety recently, but with a bit more of the rock elements. Fleischmann doesn't experiment with noise as much as he did on WELCOME TOURIST (which is a bittersweet relief)--the instrumentals now bear a strong resemblance to Schnauss' work, though not enough to be a rip-off. Instead, they share the same mood and sense of drift, while keeping a strong melodic sense. Even the slightly awkward vocals on ""Gain"" and ""From To"" aren't enough to sink the dreamy feeling. ""Aldebarian Waltz"" closes things on an slowly-growing, epic note. Quite nice overall."
3,cool rhythm and drone,"If you like American Analog Set, Tortoise, and the more accessible Stereolab stuff, you'll like this album. On those songs with vocals, he's a bit squeaky. All in all a great cool/calm party background or for long drives, very steady and strong driving beat sound, but without the frenetic lagniappe that many keyboard artists can't help but insert."
3,My Review,"The item was delivered on time and in good condition. My only complaint is that the book was labeled as an ""Advanced Reading Copy"" and I was not told this until I recieved the book and saw the front cover. It was not a huge deal, but my professor preferred that it would've been a regular copy. (Advanved Reading Copies means that it is the copy of the book before it was published so certain things haven't been removed or changed since it was not published to the public, which made it difficult due to the class requirements.)"
3,"She Knows She Can, Be What She Wants To Be","This book takes place in a southern city where people are very segragated. Life is everything but easy for 13-year-old Maggie Pugh. Her neighbors, the Boggs' are disgusting people who only care about themselves. Maggie's parents dont help either, her mother beats her. Maggie trys to get a job to help out her family and one day, she runs into her neighbor, Virgil Boggs. She has had bad experiences with him before but this time was by far the worst! He does something terrible to her but to find out you have to read the book. This book isn't the best but if you are looking for a fun but serious book to read this is it!*Laryssa, Emily and Meagan*"
3,Some Strong Cuts From The 70's,"There isn't much of the recordings that Mr. Goulet made in the 70's on disc. This album was released orginally in 1976 as ""After All Is Said And Done"", and is really a compilation of songs arranged by 3 conductors. The best, and no surprize is ""Green Years"" arranged and produced by the one and only Don Costa. It sounds great and it's the best recording Mr.G made in the 70's. It holds up well on the cuts arranged by Al Capps, with a C&W flair, which Mr. G pulls off very well. The 3 cuts arranged by Jack Elliott are out of sync with the rest of the album. However, I would recommend purchasing this cd, especially at this reasonable price."
4,Great sensible cook book.,The book was requested by my wife who had used other books from the Church Ladies. The recipes are really good and fairly easy. Highly recommend.
5,The Church Ladies,Great book at a great price. Quick to ship everything is good. I will continue to use them as much as I can . Thanks you all
3,Hard hitting album,I used to have this album on cassette back in the 90s and listen to it over and over. I bought the CD recently which showed up in decent shape and imported it into iTunes. The music is just as good as I remember it without the one wierd spot where my tape had gotten stretched.
4,As good as I remembered,"I never thought I would see a remastered version of this release. I'm not a Hoodoo Guru diehard , but this was one of my favorite cd's in college. ""Come Anytime"" is the eptiome of what was right with college radio in the 80's. Catchy chorus with jangly guitars. ""Baby Can Dance"" was my favorite. Any song that refers to thinking about a girl ""every day and night"" is something you can relate to in your early 20s. Hell, you can relate to that at any age. The remastered sound is great and meshes in well with other more recent releases on my ipod."
1,Junk,"Purchased this for a family member who uses a walker. One of the clips that attach to the walker broke off the first time it was used spilling the tray's contents all over the floor. It wasn't overloaded, only a cereal bowl and teacup. Don't waste your money."
4,File safe,"The safe arrived at my door on time and in great condition, it works fine as far as I know (we haven't had a fire, so I'm assuming that this thing is fine). There aren't even any scuff marks from shipping on the exterior."
5,Great file cabinet,"Nice cabinet, good sliding action. As the other reviews have said, you need to get the rails from Sentry for legal folder sizes, but they're good about that. The width is snug for standard folders so I wound up using the rails for standard size files, leaving some extra space in the back for things besides files. Note that this isn't really a safe, the lock is not secure."
5,Sentry Safe - Great and holds a lot!,"This is a great place to save your important papers and negatives, and whatever you hold dear - probably those things you wouldn't have put in a regular safe like our old one, which was getting really crowded and took great effort to get closed. I had a bit of a problem getting the key to work as there was condensation on the lock, but once it warmed up after delivery, the key worked fine. I put a bit of carbon spray (for my bike) in the lock and that will help too.The bottom key has a locking mechanism that secures the top drawer. This was a big question for me. The outside is a plastic-like composite that the customer service folks told me will melt and seal the drawers in case of fire. The walls are concrete, thus the weight. It's VERY heavy, so be sure you have the means to get it to where it will be placed. It slides well on carpeting, but getting it up stairs is very challenging!I recommend this safe - the customer service folks were very helpful."
2,Not as Advertised,"When it says that this filing cabinet accommodates legal folders, what it actually means is, after you receive the item, you can fill out a form requesting ""free rail modifiers"" which will take an additional 4 to 6 weeks to arrive. I think this should have been disclosed up front."
1,Don't waste the money,"The rope was great, the wheels won't spin. I had to put over 60lbs. on the pulley just to get it to lower. This item is now in my junk drawer in the garage, a true disappointment."
4,Primary documents that can really illustrate history,"Voices of Power is a very helpful book to see the actual words of those who have led countries in times of strife and success. Divided into sections on authoritarian, totalitarian, democratic and presidential leaders, this book offers small and long documents that support history's judgements.In some cases, interviews are excerpted, and in others, speeches. Churchill, Meir, Khruschev, Trotsky, Stalin- they are all here with two dozen other counterparts. i really recommend this book to history buffs and teachers- I don't think I can use it enough!"
5,Worked fine for installing pedals,"Used this grease to install new bike pedals and it worked just fine. As my previous pedals were not that old and difficult to remove, I would suggest using grease before putting new ones on."
3,Great for the purpose,"I bought this as a gag gift for my brother in law. Every Christmas we buy each other ""as seen on tv"" gifts. Its kind of a contest to see who buys the best one. I think i have this year!"
5,Relieve the pain of being forced to use Windows!,"As a life-long, well since 1984 Macintosh person, I DETEST that every now and then I'm forced to used Windows for certain applications, and once that horrible machine is opened, sometimes it's useful to use the version of Office on there. Plus, when I went back to Rutgers to finish my BA in journalism, they only used Windows. The pain of resorting to such nonsense was GREATLY relieved by this book, which made it a lot easier to get through unlearning everything I already knew and all the shortcuts I used on Mac and having to deal with such an unintuitive operating system. I would hate to have had to struggle through Windows without this book, and the spiral-bound version made it so much more convenient to keep around. When I close up my Windows machine and get back to a real computer, my Mac G5 dual processor, the book folds up nicely underneath. Kudos to Flisser, Richardson, & the Nerdy Books team!"
3,Expected just a bit more from Simon,"After reading Simon's other book, ""The Shamanic Way of the Bee"", I probably had too much expectations, because the bee-book was so utterly fantastic.So it had to disappoint a bit. And it does, because it contains a lot of true stories about people going into Darkness Visible retreats, which is fine by itself, but this tends to leave me feel hungry for more insight.Maybe because the Darkness Visible way is all about experiencing it yourself and then writing about that is far away from that, so the book medium might not be the best choice here.Nevertheless, the topic attracts you somehow to go for a Darkness Visible retreat yourself."
2,Darkness Meditation Book,"I think the darkness meditation has value. ""Darkness"" in this case has nothing to do with evil. It's more about relaxing all of our 50,000 thoughts and emotions a day to open up to deeper levels of consciousness. I read sometimes 100 pages a day. I did not care for this book, though it does have some value."
3,Essential Paradox,"Essential Paradox:This is not an audiobook.Consequently I can not simultaneously both READ and DO this book.If obligated to make a choice, I would certainly pick the doing of it.No written word can substitute for the gentleness of the human voice.Thank you, Simon. Thank you, Naomi. Thank you, Spirit of the Horse.Thank you, Mother of Darkness."
4,Much needed humor for today,"This is a good book ... although I do get rather tired of ""politics"" myself. Love the guy's humor and candor and the way he could talk with anybody."
5,Timeless classic,"For those who followed CANO in the 80's and listened to this album then in those special times in Quebec and Ontario, this album is a masterpiece. Amongst other impressions of this musical treasure, I can suggest that Bay Ste-Marie serves you a fantastic mix of deep blues and folk music and the sadness of Pluie estivale shakes your soul.Cheers!"
2,Not very satisfying,"This is the first Samantha James novel I've ever read and I was led to it by the favorable reviews of her other works. Unfortunately, this does not appear to be one of her better books. There's nothing horribly wrong with it but it was just an average read.Prose style: The language is overly flowery and James writes this book as if she's being paid by the adjective.The Heroine: The heroine is a bit of a ninny. She knows that not only her own life but the life of her young brother depend upon her keeping her identity a secret and yet she can't even lie about her name to a man made delerious by fever.The Hero: He posesses all the stock romance hero characteristics---good looking, tall, arrogant but tender, passionate to the point of near-madness etc. ----but he never really comes to life.The Plot: A very good premise but the action of this novel is too dependant on the main characters doing totally inexplicable things just to move the story along."
1,Count me as a NO,"Wow, I was amazed to see favorable ratings from two other buyers of this product. I purchased this product based on previous favorable experience with SoftWorks. This particular product from them; for me, fully missed the mark. The corkscrew is flimsy and lightweight (kinda loosey goosey). The actual screw is too short and does not go far enough into the cork. Subsequently, it does not pull the cork all the way out, so, you must pull the cork out halfway then really screw the thing in and pull again to make it work. Take it from me. I open a bottle of wine every other night so I know what I am talking about. hiccup! hiccup! I logged on tonight to find a replacement and was surprised in the irony to see this one for sale. In my opinion save your money and time do not purchase this sorry excuse for a corkscrew. Seriously, I am only making the effort to write this to save you from making the incorrect purchase."
2,Felt more durable than it was - better options out there,"When I bought this about 8 years ago, I figured it would last a very long time. It looked and felt sturdy. A few weeks ago, the screw detached and lodged itself in the cork without any means of retrieval! I eventually got it out but was surprised and disappointed this simple would fail that spectacularly. I purchased the Le Creuset Activ-Ball corkscrew as a replacement. I was surprised at how substantially easier it is to use - no need to pull at all - twist only. It also ejects the cork the same way. Durability seems good so far but only time will tell."
4,Great imaginative toy,"These are really great and my kids love them, the only drawback is my four year old has a difficult time taking the pieces apart once she is done-- the wood pieces fit very snuggly and she has broken a few which creates some dangerous weapons.Probably better for 5 and up unless your kid has really good fine motor skills. This is still a favorite toy now that she knows to ask for help taking apart."
1,Great educational toy if it was durable . . .,"Unfortunately, the product is made poorly. Sticks break easily, don't fit firmly into ""spool"" pieces, etc. Too bad. Remember this toy fondly from my own childhood (and it was very durable!)"
1,I kept looking for a reason this was published,"Someone other than the author, editor and publisher must like this book although I don't understand why. This allegory is as subtle an elephant-sized brick.Pelican pushes/is pushed to be the best - the highest, farthest, fastest etc. Pelican gains position of power and teaches the young to push/be pushed. Pelican has son die trying to be the best. Pelican has a change of heart; starts teaching the young to enjoy life. Pelican and buddy found new colony on new island. There is the manditory eco-politico-... comments about soft-shelled eggs and tainted fish.I hereby solemnly swear I will give the book to the library in case someone would actually enjoy it and will never read it again."
5,Good Stuff,I appreciate the size of the package. I especially appreciate the cleaness of the product. It has been well cleaned and is not full of extra things. The taste is good.
2,Disapointed..,"I have read all of the five star reviews and am wondering why my product is bitter? I could not eat the no bake goodies I made with it,"
5,Great buy,I purchased this product from Amazon online and I am so glad I did. I put flaxseed meal in my green smoothie each morning. I am very pleased with this product and will continue to order more as needed.I do recommend it.
2,Should not be on the market,poor picture and sound qualities; 'Naughty' would have been fun; 'Pillow' was boring. poor picture and sound qualities; 'Naughty' would have been fun; 'Pillow' was boring.
3,Bad series,"The Tenchi in Tokyo series is no where near as good as the OAV or Universe series. The animation isn't as good, and Tenchi is a complete jerk to the girls. He betrays them and this series is nowhere near as funny as the others. The addition of Sakuya is interesting, but not enough to make up for Tenchi's rudeness to the girls. Washu dosen't get a big enough part, either. I am glad that Kiyone is in this series, but she seems meaner to Mihoshi than she was in the Universe series. In short, the Tenchi in Tokyo series is a complete letdown when you have seen the other two series."
4,You can call it Tenchi's World Version 3.4,"I loved the OVA series, Mihoshi Special, the movies and the 1st TV series and now this is what I call CORE!!!!! Now you must remeber that each series gives a different way Tenchi meets the ladies of his unbalanced life(I love the OVA version more because each episode intro them separately except Kiyone's intro in the Mihoshi Special). This series does lets Tenchi grow alittle more and adding Sakuya to the cast really makes things more interesting. All the old elements are there(Ayeka and Ryoko fighting for Tenchi's love) so no Tenchi fan will lose interest. The real plus is a different villian and goal to the series that is a departure from the OVA and 1st TV series. I can't wait to see what happen next!!!"
3,Did the good animators die?,"I have noticed one thing about the Tenchi in Tokyo series. The animation borders on the same level as Pokemon and Sailor Moon(And probably some of the other animes). Sure I do think the scene involving the Jurain Stone thingy and Ryoko was pretty awesome (Although short-lived) but everything else in this series lacks goodness. The characters seem jerky, most of the enemies aren't that evil looking, and the environment always seems to be in a hazy dream-like atmosphere. Well if I do buy it the only reason would be the scene mentioned above. Bye now. Heh-heh. It says I'm only one years old."
5,A hard one to beat,"Mr Murphy has excelled himself this time. Mrs Gonad bought me this book for Christmas as some kind of warning. I was bored and so started to read. I just couldn't put this book down.I was fascinated with idea number 32, slide a pen refill in it and use as a designer writing implement. Well! I guess that is one way to put lead in your pencil.I didn't fully understand his ideas about rolling pins and was frankly revolted at his idea of using it to stir cups of tea. However, the idea of laying it at the foot of the front door to exclude draughts is both novel and energy efficient.I look forward to the coming ""100 more uses for the severed penis"". Great work Dan."
5,Must know how to use. Works great if you understand root killer.,"Root killers kill roots, they don't remove them from the line. If you expect this product to ""BURN OFF"" the roots and have nothing remaining, you will be sadly mistaken. It kills the roots. Period. If your lines are clogged with roots, you have to kill them, AND clear the line with a mechanical snake or sewer-rooter. Yes, this is a professional product and must be used with care. If you clear the line and then use it regularly, it WILL keep roots from blocking your line again.The bad reviews are likely from people who don't understand it or didn't use it correctly."
1,Be Careful !!!!!!!,"I don't know if this worked or not. I followed the instructions but the flow of my drains and the commode does not seem to have improved.The most important part of this review you should leave with is: Read the container's warnings VERY carefully BEFORE you open it. This stuff is very SERIOUS !!!!!!!! You should have protective clothing, a serious breathing apparatus and goggles. You CANNOT breath it, you CANNOT get it in your eyes !!!!!!!!!!!!!Personally: I feel this stuff is too serious to try this inexpensive fix that may yield margonal results as it did for me. Next time? I'll call a plumber and let then do whatever while I'm inside not risking my future quality of life."
5,Loads of Aliens!,"I would definitely recommend buying this as your second book after the core rulebook. Basically, it's just pack from front to back with a few hundred alien species. All stats are given, so every alien type is available for player or GM characters. Some have complained that there are no creatures in this book, but the Star Wars series has never been about dungeon crawling. If you need creatures, the famous ones are in the core book, and if you want new ones, there's a good creature creation section there too. This book, on the other hand, gets to the meat of Star Wars encounters--facing down aliens of all races and types. You'll definitely want to pick this up to populate your campaigns. Before long, you'll be able to recreate your very own alien cantina. Perhaps my only complaint is that the artwork was done by several artists, and some of the artwork isn't as good as it could be. Hopefully in a future edition, some of the sketchy artwork will be replaced."
5,One of the Best Star Wars Guides Out There,"As a long time, hardcore Star Wars reader, this is one of the most useful Star Wars reference guides I've ever owned. While it does not have every Star Wars alien from the Expanded Universe (which is over a thousand now), it has quite a few. In fact some of the aliens included can't be found in other guides. Plus every alien in the book gets a very nice illustration and a ton of useful information. Each alien has info on their species' history, average height, age span, species characteristics, homeworld, language, even typical names.It's worth noting that this book was intended for the Wizards of the Coast roleplaying game. However, most of the information in the book goes well beyond gaming stats, making it one of the few RPG Sourcebooks that's worth having whether you're a gamer or not. If you're thinking about getting a guide for Star Wars aliens, this is the one to get."
3,Fun for the whole family:),This game is a lot of fun but only last so long. I rate this average but then again I get board of racing games rather quickly.
3,passion equals sordid!,"i quite enjoyed reading this book, unlike the reader from California, i thought the character, yaara, experienced passion at its fullest,ugliest most sordid form!! i dont see her as a female stalker, but as someone who is on the road to self discovery and unknowingly utilizes this relationship as a means of understanding herself. although the author doesnt dwelve into her past one can sense that yaara has finally been awakened to life!"
4,Young Woman - Old Man,"Ya'arah Korman, in her mid twenties, falls for Arieh Even, a school buddy of her father's. Ya'arah is married to Joni, a pleasant, soft man whom she calls ""beaver"". Aryes, however, has lived in Paris for many years, is completely used up and bored stiff. But he takes Ya'arah to his chest and elsewhere, nut is bored nevertheless. How can this go on? Is Ya'arah truly in love? Or is she only longing for something new and experienced? In the end she loses Joni and rids herself of Arye. A finish that does not make very much sense.The author presents us with a modern philosophy and that may not be to everyone's taste. But the pictures she forms are worth reading. In one passage she compares an old, dying woman with somebody who shrank in the laundry. Interesting are also her comparison to the old testament, quoting Absalom and the story of the carpenter who loses his wife.Interesting and worth reading."
1,Disappointing,"I began reading this book in excitement of its rave reviews, but found it aggravating and disappointing. Often I found myself searching for a period on a page or an end to the chaos in the lives of its characters. I felt no connection with its characters, especially the main character Yaara. She is a psychological disaster, and I felt she never grew or learned from her mistakes. There was no character development. It starts with a character walking in darkness and ends that way as well."
1,where is it?,I ordered this on 9/26/06. It was stated that delivery would be 12/31/06. That delivery notice was updated to be 1/4/07-1/5/07. On 1/4/07 I received this email asking how I like my item. Today is 1/21/07 and I still don't have it. How would I rate this items?? Possibly a 5 if you would please send it!
2,Not worth the purchase,"I purchased this game and took it over to a friend's house. A bunch of us got together to play. The number of rules had my friends falling asleep and made for very slow gameplay. If you buy this game, definitely look up the FAQ the maker's website. It answers a few questions that definitely will come up during your first game and the enclosed rules do not answer (we played under a few false assumptions). It would be more fun with the better explained rules but the rules are way too complicated and annoying to make for a very good game. The guns only hold up to 4 bullets (some only have 2 bullets). You don't roll dice to see if you kill zombies but instead pull combat cards (your gun is likely to jam). Overall, the rules just don't make a lot of sense and the gameplay is slow."
3,Rocky Balboa's Wife Goes Bonkers!,Standard thriller in which Don Corleone's only daughter goes cuckoo and engages in some serious stalking. Talia Shire's fan can add a star.....
4,landlady,a good movie with a great storyline. it is a must see film full of drama and suspense. what a good buy.
5,Made my wife cry,Enough said; just what I bought it for. Just what the doctor order for her joy and happiness into her world.:-)
3,Good cd.,"Debby Boone has a great voice and it was really good to hear some of these old songs again. The main reason that I bought this cd was for the song ""You light up my life"". No one sings that song like Debby. The rest of the cd is very good too though."
4,The best of Debby Boone,"I was very happy to see this release of Debby Boone's material. It is a great compilation of her songs from the late 70's and early 80's. You Light Up My Life is a beautiful song and no other celebrity can sing it the way Debby does. I enjoyed her country hits as well: ""Are You On The Road to Lovin' Me Again"" and ""Perfect Fool"" were at the top of the charts and are fun songs. There is so much more material that could have been placed on this album like ""Take It Like A Woman""; ""Savin' It Up"" and ""Meet Me on the Dance Floor"". There was a variety of types of music she sang that showed her versatility. Many will enjoy this album, but it is a shame that many other of her songs could not have been included. Curb records has recently released a compilation of her inspirational songs which is done very well too. If you purchased both of these CD's you will be satisfied. I'd love to see some new material from her. She is a great talent and never received the recognition she deserved."
2,Buyer Beware,"I purchased this King James Version leather bound bible and at first was impressed by the leather binding and overall quality. However, with relatively little use and in little time, the binding completely came apart. I tried to use black tape to reinforce the binding but eventually (and I mean only a couple years after purchase), the covers came completely off of the book. I have seen one other review on here regarding the binding, and I think a leather bible with a purchase price of well over $100 should be of better quality binding."
2,One page not trimmed,Very pour quality control. One page had to be trimmed as the corner extended out from the other pages. I expected more because of the price I paid.
2,Not like the older ones,I had a Cambridge Bible years ago and it was a great Bible. This Bible is a bit on the smallish side and the binding wasn't right on it. I returned it. I bought another Bible from Local Church Bible Publishers and it's a great Bible. They're a Baptist group that makes Bibles at cost. Their Bibles make the Cambridge Bible look like a toy. If you're looking for a good bible check them out. This Bible is over priced.
4,Reveals that Angels were not Mrs. White's true source,"Mr. Rea was a Seventh-day Adventist pastor who was totally devoted to the writings of Ellen G. White. In his devotion he decided to read books that Mrs. White was known to own and read. What he found in these other books was the same sequence of thought, wording, and word for word quotes that Mrs. White claimed as her own.After further investigation, Mr Rea found incontrivertable proof of extensive plagerism by Mrs. White. Through numerous side by side comparisons, Mr. Rea shows proof positive that instead of being a phophet, Mrs. Whate was a plagerist.This book is a must read for any one considering joining the Seventh-day Adventist church or for any SDA who s open-minded enough to accept the truth about their church and its founder."
4,Shocking but TRUE!,"Walter Rea may have a chip on his shoulder as he writes this book but the information he recorded it true and a hard pill to swallow for Seventh-Day Adventists. I really didn't read this book until I had already left the SDA church. I read it after one of my relatives claimed that their prophet Ellen White had predicted the Sept 11 tradegy, which is not true. So I set off to write a 19 page paper on the top of Ellen White's prophetic claims and I leaned heavily on Walter Rea's book as well as my past experiences in the church. If you want to read it go to: http://customer.wcta.net/sly/egw.htmIf you contact me at the above email (slyhome@wcta.net) make sure you include the phrase ""From the Midwest"" in the subject line or body so that it will get past my anti-spam program."
5,It's About Time!,"As a former SDA, I'm glad to see people exposing this insidious cult for what it is. In addition to the falsities of Ellen White, there are many rotten aspects to this church that are hidden under their veneer of piety quite similar to the pedophile scandals of the Catholic Church. Unfortunately, due to the Amazon terms in their Conditions of Use, I cannot go into the grisly details. However, I am writing a book which certainly will. Those dumb enough to support this church, know that your tithe money ends up in the White estate trust to fatten the wallets of her offspring. Mr. Rea has performed a community service by exposing this church and I applaud him."
2,"It isn't that she copied, but that she copied so much!","It's not the fact that she copied material from other people that is getting her into trouble,rather that she copied so much. Walter Rae fails to tell us how much is allowed before we must reject the material. If even the smallest amount is not permissiable, then we would have to be rid of the Gospel of Luke, along with Matthew and Mark. How much is too much brother Walter?"
1,What a Whopper!,"This is one book (of very few) that I'd definitely recommend to be burned on a cold winter night. The work is sloppily done, the conclusions exceed the bounds of the ""evidence"" and in many cases the evidence is distorted (as to why I can't tell) in a variety of ways (for example, occasionally you'll find that sentances from her alleged source(s) are clipped so as to make them either begin or end with the same word as can be found in EGW's books, etc.)(...)"
1,Book Written in the spirit of vengence,"Unfortunately the writer of this book is not writing for the good of people. He is not even writing this book to find the truth. It seems that he wrote this book, just because he was unwilling to accept what Ellen White wrote. Incidently, if you use the authors definition of plagarism, he himself is a plagarist because he extensively quotes Ellen White's materials in his book, to prove his point."
2,Not Quite,"Being a huge Trey fan, I'm sorry to report that this CD is highly disappointing. I would describe this music as ""pleasant"", at best. After two listens, I'm fully bored.""Seis"" deserves some credit since it's neat to hear orchestral versions of Trey/Phish songs (All Things Reconsidered; Guyute). Inlaw Josie Wales is nice, but can be found on Phish's far-superior ""Farmhouse"".Additionally, the 29-minute length (!) makes this CD a rip-off at full price.If you're just dying to hear Trey in this orchestral format, I'd recommend borrowing ""Seis"" from the library."
4,"Good, but short",I love the concept and its a great album to listen too. The only problem is it is impeccably short and as such is not really worth the price.
5,Thank you Renaissance!,"Duke was the singer/keyboard player on 707's debut album back in 1980. Sadly he was gone by the time ""The Second Album"" was released in 1981. If, like me, you think that was their best work you are gonna love this!These songs are pure Duke McFadden if you like the first album this is a goldmine over 71 minutes with 18 songs of great music including 3 707 demos featuring a smoking version of ""I Could Be Good For You"". Duke really shines on the title track and other stand outs ""I've Got Tonight"", ""Bring It On Back"", ""She Moves Me"" and ""Holding On""...not a dud in the bunch. Hats off to Renaissance Records for getting this and other 707 releases on CD."
5,Connected All the Dots,"How is it possible that the full story about Iraq has never been presented as it finally has been in this extraordinary book. Clearly, Mr. Black has conducted exhaustive research within the oil company archives and governmental records, revealing the real reason we have been in Iraq for 90 years--and that is: oil. The Red Line Agreement printed on the inside front cover is reason enough to purchase this compelling book, which I admit, I could not put down. Banking on Baghdad connected all the dots for me, and the picture was not pretty."
4,fascinating but a 'hard read',"I found the information to be extremely worthwhile, although i found EB's writing style to be dry... not in the 'droll' sense, in the 'boring' sense... still in all, I do recommend the book, very much!"
4,Fun for word lovers,"I bought this book to help study for one of the categories in a local spelling bee (the category was words from Reader's Digest's ""It Pays to Enrich your WordPower""). I love word and always enjoy reading this section of the Reader's Digest so having years and years worth of these lists is fun!"
1,A bunch of radio static...,"And is just as interesting as a bunch of radio static. If you want high-grade Black/death metal, get ""World funeral"" by Marduk or ""Storm of the light's bane"" by Dissection."
2,its a shame.....,"there is a posibility that this could be a solid album....however, this has possiby the worst recording quality of any alum i have ever heard(yes, worse than carcass' ""reek""), which completely ruins any redeeming quality of the music. however, check out their later stuff, high-grade black metal with slick recording."
1,Don't take my opinion as gospel...,"This book may not be as bad as I think. In all likelihood it's not. Grant Morrison is an extremely talented writer and Frank Quitely is a gifted artist. It just doesn't feel like the X-men to me. I loved Quitely's art on The Authority, but seeing it applied to X-men I've known and loved for years makes them seem, well, uglier somehow. And Grant Morrison's hinting at marital troubles between Scott Summers and Jean just seems to fly in the face of so many years of character building.Like I said, don't take my opinion as gospel. That would be about the greatest disservice you could do to yourself. I truly believe that the comicbook (as Stan Lee spells it) is a viable art form and this book is an accurate representation of true artists at work. I just miss the Jim Lee days."
3,Classic Comic Story Telling Today...,"The word I thought of in reading Quitely and Morrison's version of the X-men was ""dense."" As in ""the work exhibited some density"": every frame and every sentence played an important role in the development of the story. There wasn't much, if any, creative waste, if i can phrase it that way. Another word I thought of was ""beautiful"": Quitely's lines and Morrison's words stand separately and work together both, forming a very clean, excitingly fluid story reminiscent of some of John Byrne's or Neal Adams's best work. Unfortunately, the duo's cooperation isn't seen throughout this book: fill-in artists serve on several pages. Regardless, Quitely's and Morrison's work make this worth noting if not buying.Thank you.Roland"
1,what do we stand for,"This Mark Green better review his sources. My people came here in 1635, the rest of my family on mom side was here to greet them (indian) Samual B huntington was a forefather of mine and head ;of the Continental before george washington became president. Mark Green I am afraid is so liberal it must hard for him to smile. I am warning friends and family NOT to putchase this book. Katherine I would give it a zero but your form won't jtake itGoold, Mancelona, Mi. 49659"
1,Not as described,"I agree with Robert these are not heavy duty, The wire is only a little heavier than 8 and less than 6. Everyone but Robert bragged how good they are, I thought Robert was wrong. Turns out he is the only one that knows his stuff. Now I have cheap cables for boosting lawnmowers and such."
1,Heavy Duty Booster Cables,These are not heavy duty. They are not 4 gauge as advertized. Maybe 8 awg but definately not 4.
1,Not 4 Gauge - False Advertisment,"This is not a #4 wire. I thought it looked pretty thin so I measured the diameter with calipers, and found it to be just under 0.13"". This more closely corresponds to #8 which has a diameter of 0.1285. It seems to have decent enough clamps but this is nothing more than undersized wire with very thick insulation.I'm returning mine. This really hacks me off. This is the second time recently that I have bought something from Amazon that was very different from the description."
5,16' Booster cables,I bought these cables for my son for Christmas. Before I presented the gift I had an occasion to use the cables. Two of our cars were parked in the garage and I inadvertantly left the trunk ajar on one car causing the battery to go dead. The battery is in the trunk of the stalled car but I was able to use the 16' cables to reach from under the hood of one car to the trunk of the other. These cables saved a lot of hassle that day!!!
5,"Good quality product, relatively low price.","Good product, Found it here for very cheap. Has a carry case. Works as described. If you have a Full Size car or an SUV this is a must to have."
5,"Dazed, But Confused No Longer!","What a fabulous biography of the world's greatest band! From the way they all got started, to the incredible overlap with other rockers' careers, to the meanings and history of the songs, to the unbelievable drinking, drugging, and debauchery, and all the other behind-the-scenes goings-on; this book was a great way to spend a few hours! For any LZ or rock music fan, this is a must read!"
5,Hammer Of The Gods is a must read for any Led Zeppelin Fan,I have this book and its one that I can read again and again.Some of it seems far fetched but you have to remember the times were alot different back then as well. Being up in my age I can recall the time period of the high flying Zeppelin and reading about them in the magazines that this book mentions.If you get any book about Mr. Page and company this would have to be it.
3,Stairway To Heaven?,"As any good rock and roll fan who also like adores the leisurely activity of reading, you almost have to read ""Hammer Of The Gods"", The Led Zeppelin Saga. How else would you learn the interesting facts about this legendary band? The debauchery, the booze, the tragedy, the success....I'm sure there are potentially better Zeppelin books out there, but why not start or end with this one?"
3,Don't expect too much from this fun read,"This book is extremely well researched and contains an incredible amount of detail about the band and its members.Its weakness, and it's a big one, is that the author gives the reader little sense of perspective or narrative comment. It reads like this: ""This happened. Then this happened. And then this happened, then this...""While it would be a mistake to try and tell readers what to think, this account goes so far in the opposite direction that despite all of the wild and often abusive exploits of these musicians, it reads in the bland way newspaper stories often do. So much more could have been done with the material and while the author occasionally dabbles in the style of Tom Wolfe, not much is holding the narrative together except the paper the words are printed on.Oddly, the very end of the book contains some wondeful writing that surprisingly appears only there."
4,Entertaining,"I enjoyed this book. I liked reading the back story on many of Led Zeppelin's classic tunes such as Stairway to Heaven, Trampled Underfoot, When the Levee breaks, the immigrant song, and the list goes on.Even though the author never spoke to actual band members you don't feel like the book is all hearsay. I learned a lot about the band in this book. To be honest my impression of Bonzo changed a lot in my mind. Sounds like a real A hole when he was drunk. Each band member was a highly interesting character in their own right.This book ties the band and the music scene of their time together well. Listening to the Box set after reading this book adds more meaning and spin to them."
3,Book,"""Hammer of the Gods"" is very informative as to the organizing and musical abilities of the group members. It gets a little bogged down describing the tours and damage done by various members of the entourage. I think more emphasis could have been made on the creative influences, although these are mentioned in some detail. An interesting read."
4,"Great Band, Great Book","This book, is a must for any zeppelin fan. The book contains a ton of information. From the Yardbirds right up to the end. Some people are skeptable about this book due to the fact that the information could be jolted. I feel while at times the stories sound so true and detailed. While other stories are just mentioned. Richard Cole, the band's stage manager, gives buckets of quotes. I feel the book is great because, you hear all these rumors and stories about zeppelin, but this book gives it straight. It openly admits that LZ's III (three), was not well liked by critics; then quotes Jimmy Page's disappointment.All in all, i suggest this book, to one and all. Whether a huge Zeppelin fan, or just a music fan in general."
3,I read this in one day.,"It's okay, very interesting and very, very readable. It dies down quite a bit after John Bonham dies. Aww... You might be ""Zepped"" out after reading this though. Well, back to my plate spinning."
1,Seller Rip-Off,My wife bought this book on my account for my birthday knowing I am a massive Led Zeppelin fan. This is a 7.99 paperback book(and cheaper elsewhere) sold at 24.99. They've even got the cheek to charge delivery.I am not happyI haven't even started the book yet
2,Not fair....,"I believe that the author was not fair to the Band. Some of the things that were written made the Greatest Band of All Time sound like a bunch of idiot's, when it is obvious by there success that they were and still are serious businessmen, Yeah they had some good times on the road, I think all rock stars do crazy things, But the author only focuses on second hand gossip. How Tacky!"
3,Biased biography,"This is a great book for Led Zeppelin fans because it was clearly written by a fan. The author seems to be constantly telling us how great Zeppelin was. They certainly were a great band, and the book has a lot of interesting facts and tales of the band on the road, but there is barely a mention of Page's heroin addiction or the fact that these guys were not exactly prolific songwriters. Their albums typically had less than ten songs on them, and many were [too similar to]old blues songs. Yet, the author wants to tell us that this band was so incredibly important musically. I'd argue Zeppelin was important culturally since they were the start of the suburban American heavy metal experience for kids growing up. Anyway, the book is a fun read, but don't take the author's declarations about Zeppelin's greatness too seriously, after all it's only rock n' roll and they were only a rock n' roll band."
3,Tabloid in paperback form,"I read it. I'm not proud, but I did. I figured I couldn't possibly be a true Led Zepp fan if I didn't read this book. I bought the paperback, which doesn't include any bio on the author, but I assume he's british. He explains in detail what most Americans take for granted, and takes for granted the reader knows stuff I guess only the British do. He also praises Led Zepp for being Rock 'n Roll pioneers, but berates bands who have the audacity to be influenced by them. (calling Rush ""the dreaded Canadian group""?) Still, I read the whole thing. The author wanted us to know the entire set list of every show. Pretty tiresome. This book was like a bloody car accident. You just have to look. Even when you know you should move on. I still love Led Zeppelin, in spite of the book. I guess that means I'm a true Zepp fan after all!"
3,"Led Zeppelin, not quite a lead balloon.","The story of Led Zeppelin, and the bands rise to fame, fortune and tragedy is a story I had wanted to know. I got the impression that this interpretation was leaving something out.But for some reason, the picture of Plant looking out from the balcony of the Riot House in the middle of the book keeps coming back to me.I guess having a balcony is symbolic of success, but also reaffirms how near a downfall can always lurk."
3,"Great book, but bad, bad paper quality and printing.","This is a classic book in the rock memoir genre. So, if you like reading about the Rock N' Roll lifestyle and adventures, you should buy this without any doubt.Now, the problem here is the quality of the product. This is the cheapest of the cheapest paper, and the printing is just as bad. Of course, you can read the whole thing, every word is readable. The publisher did a better job with the cover and the black and white pictures inside, but it feels amazingly cheap anyway.If you can get a more decent edition of this book, then stay away from this one. But if you can't seem to find anything else, then, well, what the hell."
2,"Not Enriching, But Good Inside Story","So everyone who told me to read this for years was right: this is ""the"" epic and definitive account of their birth and wanton tales of wandering in the 70s. Thanks to Aram for seconding the recommendation, and lending me it so I could read it at last. I liked the personal warmth between the band members, or at least most of them. I also love getting a sense of just what drove such incredible innovation and energy. It's inspiring to me and makes me want to jam. Get my very own Bonzo set of classic hard rock drums. While it's not especially enriching, it sure was fun vicarious living. Grade: C+."
3,Interesting,"Hammer of the Gods was interesting. I loved reading it...couldnt put it down, being an outrageous fan, but keeping in mind that most of it was probably fabricated. Only God knows how this book was published because the band claims to not have known the author that well, but it really plays up the ""aura"" of Zeppelin rather than the actual everyday activities that filled up the other 75% of their decade. Without a doubt their reign was full of events inconveivable to the common person, but that seems to be all that was focused on in the book...maybe that's why it was so damn good, however, I take away two stars for the amount of glitter the book contained."
2,"I don't have a ""Whole Lotta Love"" for this book","I'll make this short and sweet and try not to ""Ramble On"". Ok, I'm sorry, I'll stop doing that.I haven't made it all the way through the book, and yet I'm compelled to write a review on it. It's that painful or I'm just that disappointed. I'm just shy of the halfway mark and I'm almost tempted not to finish it. The book tends to jump forward in time and then back haphazardly, meanwhile, the piecing together of the history, story, and facts are poorly done. It's hard to determine what is truth and what is exaggerated regarding the bands legendary shenanigans. The book lacks proper structure and there seems to have been a greater interest in getting as much information (I use this term loosely) in the book rather than telling a story. Do yourself a favor, pass on this mediocrity and find another source for your Led Zeppelin fix, as this book will just leave you feeling ""Dazed and Confused"". I'm sorry...I couldn't help myself."
5,Get the Led Out NOW!!!,"This book is the best info that I've found on Zeppelin to date. This is my favorite all time Reading material by them so far. Come on, you know you wanna get the Led out, so what are you waiting for? HAMMER OF THE GODS RULES... JOEDRUMS"
4,Led Zeppelin at thier best and worst on the road.,"Led Zeppelin on the road. At times rude and crude, this is a look at a band on the road from the inside. From the early days of struggle to the heady days of the Zep as rock Gods. Perhaps the single most influential band of its time Led Zeppelin not only broke new ground in recording techniques, record sales, and concert attendance but brought new meaning to the concept of ""a loss of innocence"". Hammer of the Gods is an interesting insight into the strengths, weaknesses, and vices of a legendary rock icon"
1,Bad advertising,"You know you made a bad purchase the minute you press play and see the word ""foreign"" misspelled. This collection of 80's commercials are hardly considered among the best of their era. By today's international standards they stink. Most look like the same cheesy, repetitive advertising you see everyday on TV. Why pay for these when you can watch the same annoying stuff for free is my dilemma."
5,Where is my Toshiro?,"I fell in love with this book several years ago (6 or so) after borrowing it from a small library in my town that has since shut down. Then I couldn't find the book anywhere! Thanks to sites like this and people selling out of print books used, I was able to get it again--and read it 2 more times (in addition to the first two times when I had had it)!You will fall in love with this sweet, gentle, yet amazingly masculine, virile male. He is so human in quality that you could just imaging him existing somewhere in the world---I'm hoping he does. This book is a MUST READ!"
4,Yellow Alert,"Star Trek had those TV episodes that made you think after the Captain or his First Officer would end the show with a thought provoking analysis of their latest encounter. Then there were the episodes that were not as cerebral to mix things up a bit. Twilight's End is kind of a mix of the two. This book has the dramatic story of an alien planet in peril mixed with a proposed remedy only a sci-fi story could get away with. The story has all the elements of a typical Star Trek romp with its alien encounters, tense filled segments and the obligatory attack scenes. Somewhere along the way is an environmental story tucked in to round out the melee.This is a fun read and another escape into that Final Frontier !"
1,Analyze That,"The flip side of this disc was not responding. It ""froze"" towards the end. I cleaned the disc several times, also cleaned the DVD player. All to no avail. Very frustrating.E-mailed the seller. Did NOT receive a reponse!!! Very disappointed! J.P. Davis"
5,If you know your mob flicks,"As an avid viewer of the gangster genre, I went into this one with high hopes...and wasn't disappointed. This film paints mobsters in the same sympathetic light that the original Godfather does (not the other ones, of course). DeNiro reenacts his famous heavy-handed mobster role with a whole new perspective in this very entertaining comedy. His off the wall character of a mob boss who breaks into tears at random intervals is priceless. Crystal works as the perfect dichotomy as the nervous psychologist who winds up over his head before he knows what has hit him. This film, although nothing past a simple comedy, is terrifically written and has more than it's fair share of laughs. Watch it. Have fun."
3,This and that,"Analyze This is funny, creative and entertaining. I couldn't wait to see it again. Analyze That is contrived, stilted and boring. I could hardly make it through one sitting."
4,Analyze These,"I think more blu-rays should come in the cheaper double feature format. ""Analyze This"" is the best thing Billy Crystal has done -- he plays a jaded, milquetoast analyst living in his father's shadow, suddenly thrown into the world of the mob, while trying to start a new life with a new wife. ""Analyze That"" continues when mobster-patient De Niro is released from prison in Crystal's FBI-imposed custody. What? A lot more talky than the faster, tenser, and funnier predecessor -- and no Chazz Palminteri. But it's not without its moments, namely De Niro's dream image of Crystal as a snorting Sigmund Freud, and outtakes during the closing credits."
2,Better of the 2 bt still a 2.5 star at best for language,"This was an amusing movie, but the language is 100% gutter. Rounded down from 2.5 stars to 2 stars for language. I Acutally liked Analyze That a little better than Analyze This. but now that I've seen them once, I see no need to see them again."
5,One MOVIE is very much good ! ...TWO are splendids,BILLY CRYSTAL as much as ROBERT DE NIRO Forms a good team and in the fiction same at rhe reality : They are FRIENDS !

5,This movie is awesome,Love them. They are extremely funny. I have watched them over 50 times throughout the years. Eventually I just bought them.
5,Great Fast Service & Happy Teenager,"I bought my son a new computer last month since we were redoing his room. Unfortunately it did not have a network card for our wireless home network. I went to B*&t B@y; they were out; none in inventory. told him and he said ""No, I don't need a network card, just a USB."" I went to Amazon, found one quickly, and 2 days later he was on line doing homework (yeah, right!). That store still doesn't have any stock in (its on the barge....) But, thanks Amazon!! Great work!"
3,Gets work done - Be patient please.....,Internal network card broke down on my out of warranty laptop so after reading lots of review i decided to buy this dongle...have used it for more than 2 week by now...I would say it is way too big and equally slow...it blocks at least two USB ports(if they are next to each other - up down or side by side)...gets the work done though but is damn slow...you really need to have good amount of patience....
1,What a joy to get a refund for this disaster,"Does nothing. It might as well be a rock. I spent 2 hours on hold for tech support which was no help at all.If you can ever get through to them, they can only tell you where to find the driver on the web. Since it's the same driver that comes in the box, that accomplishes nothing.What a pleasure to send this thing back. Never again D-Link!"
2,Serves its purpose,"This adapter gets very warm, very fast. When it over heats, my computer freezes and has to be restarted. Because of this, I cannot keep the adapter plugged in. It works ok for me since the computer I use it on is an old pc that only gets used about once a week. If you need something for a computer that is used often, get something else."
1,Died after a year,The title says it all. The device kept disconnecting from the wireless network and had to be reset. Then D-Link stopped updating their drivers. Probably not going to go with D-Link in the future.
2,"Buyers beware, ask questions","D-link does in fact make great quality products....The Sellers DO NOT give half the information needed to make a stable purchase.I was able to load a driver for this wireless adapter, BUT, D-link no longer has support or drivers for this OUTDATED product !! You will find out the hard way when you get support from the Internet, dozens of sites say It's free and you wind up having to register for a sharp price to actually load the item you're finding a driver for ! If you don't do your homework before you make a purchase, don't buy it !! I also bought a New Webcam from a DIFFERENT seller and didn't know you had to have a VERY Fast up to date Computer to work it and it was a FUZZY experience ! You're on the Internet reading this, do your homework before making a purchase ! Notice the Product I purchased didn't even have the Model number on it Shame on me and shame on the Seller for offering half good TRASH !"
5,Great wireless adapter,"This was the easiest thing to use ever. Literally just plugged into the USB port on computer, it auto-installed itself, picked up the wireless signals around, found mine, put in password and up and running!About 1 minute from open box to surging web. Fantastic little device."
2,Short life,Died after 4-5 months. Now light does not even turn on when connected to the computer. Reception was never strong.
5,Economical connectivity for 64-bit OS,"I used to buy only Linksys products, until I installed 64 bit Edition of Vista... At the date of purchase, Lynksys did not have Vista 64 bit drivers much less Linux compatibility....So I give this inexpensive D Link a try..COMPLETE SATISFACTION FOR ME:Also I wanted to have and adapter that could work out of the box for Linux and it does the job. D Link has many products Linux compatible.My selection of Oses: Vista Ultimate 64 bit, Ubuntu 64 bit (OUT OF THE BOX); XP Professional 32 Bit"
1,This is very bad experience,"When I received the USB Adapter, I was instructed to go online to download the software for free. Instead, I was told during the process that this is a trial version and have to buy it after 30 days. I tried another P C, same result.I called the phone number from a piece of paper which comes with the adapter, but that is not working number. I dialed an another one found from Amazon 3 times and heard nothing back from the seller!Once they received the Adapter from me, the seller started to contact me by E mail offered me free shipping with a software disc. But I am not appreciated the service and asked my credit company to dispute the purchase.Apparently, I have to pay the shipping fees!"
5,Great amazon service...,"Ordered through amazon, item not delivered for 1 week after estimated delivery, e-mailed amazon customer service and within 48 hours got notice that they shipped a second item which arrived quickly. Item works well, good range and definately better than the internal wireless network card."
1,Simply does not work,"I bought this product for my fathers old laptop (with windows xp) since it didnt come with a wireless modem. I followed the instructions that came with the adapter, I downloaded the drivers it needed, but when the installation told me to plug in the adapter, the adapter wasn't recognized, i thought it was the old computer, so i tried it in my newer laptop with w7 but the same thing happened, finally i tried it with a desktop (with windows vista), and once again the adapter wasn't recognized.I spent about 3 to 4 hours trying to make it work.I will be returning this product asap and ask for my money back, i don't want a replacement because i wouldn't buy this thing again."
1,"D-link, in my experience, is a horrible brand","Long story short, I've owned a few D-Link products.. and all of them were low quality. I should have bought a different wireless adapter instead of this one.My main gripe is that it drops connection intermittently (probably up to 10 times per hour lately it seems)."
2,"it can be used, but the longevity is too short, only one month...","Yes, it can be used, but the longevity is too short, only for one month...where can I repair it? thx"
4,Reasonable wireless USB adapter option,"Just installed this product today. About 20-30 minutes after opening the box, I'm connected to the Internet. A couple of notes about the install:-The buttons on the autorun installation menu didn't work for me. I had to navigate to my CD drive and find the setup file to start the installation-The drivers are bundled up with a (useless?) D-Link connection manager and there is no easy way to install (or uninstall) one without the other...On the plus side, I get a pretty good signal 25ft away through a wall, so it does the job it's supposed to."
4,Good Adapter,"The adapter was easy to install and worked well, but was limited to a PC upstairs directly over my Belkin N1 router. It would not function on the opposite side of the house approximately 40 feet distance from the present location. I am satisfied with the results."
