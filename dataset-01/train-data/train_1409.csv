2,Stick to the print version!,"This book sounds like a fun, light read, but the narration in the abridged Audio version kills it! The author recites the book herself, but her voice is very flat and frankly, boring. She makes little differentiations between characters in her voice, and her attempts at acting make listening to the book confusing, since you are never sure who is the current first person in the narrative. The book itself is not bad though, this is just not a great recording."
3,A cute summer book,"It's been fun to read, but it's not what I thought it was about. My family hunts and fishes and so serveral friends gave me this book as joke thinking it was about hunting and fishing. There was a girl's guide to smoking cigars, that was really about the title. So just don't make the same mistake we did. It's about hunting for men, not animals."
4,Hilarious and poignant,"Single women everywhere, Unite! If you are tired of all the ""rules"" you need to follow in order to get a man then you have to read this book! Melissa Bank makes the rules and breaks them again with her book. She is witty, bright and not the most beautiful fish in the sea, and yet she can end up with the man of her dreams just by dare I say it, ""being herself""! The dialogue is smooth and funny, and there are some touching moments as well,like the chapter about her father. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to women especially, but men may enjoy it too if they want to get an insight on ""the rules"" as well."
2,More hype than substance,"I too read many of the rave reviews & was disappointed because I expected much more than what I got. I don't think Banks gave us a unique perspective on relationships or women in love. In fact, I didn't like her protaganist. I too disliked the predictable ending."
2,The ending completely killed it.,"I was very excited to read this book, seeing how it's been on the bestsellers' list for so many weeks. The opening was captivating and entertaining. However, midway through, the book began to drag on and it finally (mercifully) crawled to an end. I HATED Faith and Bonnie's ideals, and I felt that Banks should have taken another approach to the closing. What could have been a stellar book turned out to be another overated flop."
4,a breath of clean air,"I read the NY Times article about Melissa Banks and GGTF&H and afterwards bought the book. Its not The Second Sex, but it isn't meant to be! Its funny, reflective and contemporary. My background is entirely different from Janes so I found her innocence refreshing. She had a certain self confidence inspite of her self consciousness. It read quickly (one evening) and was well worth that small amount of my time!"
2,AM I MISSING SOMETHING?,"I was VERY disappointed in this book. The first story was brilliant and funny, but the rest of the book barely held my interest. I have been very into short stories this summer, but after having just read three books by Alice Munro, this just didn't measure up. Melissa Banks is probably a gifted writer, but I honestly don't see what all the fuss over this book is about. Slim pickings this year."
4,Very amusing,"I found GGHF to be an amusing and crisply narrated group of stories. The characters were adroitly drawn, the humor fresh. What's even more amusing, however, are the mean-spirited customer reviews -- especially the recent reader who said that anyone who likes this book enjoys soap operas and is illiterate. The arrogance of such a remark is stunning; I can only imagine the kind of bitter, pretentious and hugely insecure person who would be driven to this kind of blanket judgement. A graduate of Yale, I thoroughly enjoyed this book -- I am certain I am not the only smart woman who liked it. Clearly there are some people who need a good long rest, and to stop looking at Amazon as a way to spew venom. Of course, it IS a compliment to the author that anyone could be psychotically fixated on ""bringing the curve down."" -- she must have struck a nerve. Simply hilarious."
5,My favorite book!,This book is my favorite book ever - I have read it countless times and each time it is a new experience. I hope Melissa Bank writes another book soon!
1,Pointless Ramblings,"This book is very disappointing...it rambles on with no point. Bridget Jones, the book's comparison, is much, much better. Bank also offended me personally referring to her slurred words as ""being stupid with a no running water, Appalachian accent"". How can an author be respected that would lower themself to think so stereotypically? I'm very sorry I wasted my precious time reading this book. It is not even worthy of one star!"
5,THE BEST BOOK EVER,"I have read this book a total of a million times, and I find something new about it everytime, it is funny, and sad, and beautiful, and true (and if you read it you will understand why) Girls' Guide is a masterpiece, and I suggest anyone to read it!"
3,Girl's guide to airport delays,"I read this book on a looong three connections flight to the majestic Rockies. It was better than airplane food but not The Book of the summer. I don't mind stories that jump around in time, but space? How did our in-the-1st-person narrator become a different in-the-1st-person? Still, I will keep an eye out for Ms. Bank's next tome, as she does possess a wry wit."
3,Not at all like Bridget Jones!!!!,"This book is a great beach read...basically brainless entertainment. It is as challenging as watching a film. On its own, I probably would have enjoyed the book but after all the comparison to Bridget Jones's Diary, I was really hoping for the wit and humor of a New York Bridget. Unfortunately, that wasn't what The Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing was all about. Actually, it didn't even feel very New York to me. The zany stressed out single city lifestyle really didn't seem at all evident. Entertaining but a disappointment!"
5,A Can't Miss--The Best Book of the Year,"If you loved Bridget Jones's Diary, you will also love this book. Written in a style so easy to read, you will become this girl as you flip the pages. In this novel, the reader experiences some of life's tragic moments with the main character, Jane, as well as some of her best moments. This book is so much fun. I hated to be done reading it, and I honestly couldn't put it down until the very end. Buy this book now! It is the best book of the year, no doubt, and the best book since Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones's Diary."
4,"Well written, but not really representative","Although I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel and found the style of writing to be quite appealing, I do not believe that the relationships throughout are truly representative of modern strife in search of an acceptable husband. Although I am sure I don't represent all 20-30 something unmarried women, I find it difficult to comprehend some of the scenarios with Jane's dating patterns. For example, I would think most of us would avoid seeing a boozer older than our fathers. Perhaps that is just me. All in all, however, the story was captivating, and I really enjoyed the last section of the book where Jane turns to a how-to book for dating advice."
2,It wasn't bad....but it wasn't ......,This was Okay - but that's about it. Nothing to compelling or exciting about it. Read it if you have nothing else in the house.
5,Mistakes seldom rocket to the top,"I quite enjoyed THE GIRLS GUIDE TO HUNTING AND FISHING. The stories were compelling and often shocking -- I especially liked Archie -- her making him a sympathetic character is proof of her gifts. The naysayers in this quaint n' cruel forum seem hysterical in their breakneck attempts to downgrade a major success. One may not cotton to Jane, but GGHF is indeed well written (how could anyone debate this?). I found it humorous, original, and striking; not like Bridget Jones in the least. I laughed at loud at many places, not the least of which was the Mister Mother%$#$^ line and the Aunt Rita line (""Men think with their &*%^$s""). Those who frothily disagree with Ms. Bank's triumph can make it right when they have their own books on the NYTimes bestseller list. I am sure that will be happening at any moment."
2,The Girls Guide,This book was not what I thought it was going to be. It talked analytically and figuratively. I did not find a point to the book until the very END. One chapter seemed like it didn't even fit.
1,"A real ""must not read"" of the summer.","I rarely read fiction but bought this book because it was half off. After reading it over the weekend, I couldn't even really tell you what it was about. Pointless and non-engaging. This is not what being an unmarried gen-xer in your late 20s is about. I was blinded by the reviewer's hype in two women's magazines I subscribe to and only blame myself for this purchasing mistake. I'll stick to non-fiction."
1,Not Another Book on Dating in the 90s!!!,"I wanted to like this book. However, I found it disappointing. There were no fresh ideas. The story jumped around and therefore, was hard to follow. Furthermore, the characters were like cardboard. Want a better book on dating? Try ""Come Together"" by Josie Lloyd and Emlyn Rees."
2,"Hook, line, and a stinker","I'm a guy who thought Bridget Jones was cute but this book is this year's piece of fluff. Aren't there better writers out there who deserved to be published?? This book is tiny to begin with and has more than a few blank pages and what's in between is weak and unispiring. Poor little rich girls are boring to read. 130lbs. and counting, no cigs, five cookies, read another over hyped book!"
1,cheap knock-off of Bridget Jones' Diary,"unoriginal drivel that tries so hard to match the fresh voice and wit of Helen Fielding's wonderful Bridget Jones' Diary ....and fails miserably. Whereas BJD was funny and quirky, this novel was dull with a few funny antedotes here and there, but not enough to save this book. Too bad Bank tried to mimic Fielding in most of the book, and only shows a glimpse of her own literary voice... maybe next time she will be braver."
1,"Amusing, but unoriginal","I liked this book the first time I read it -- when it was called Bridget Jones's Diary. The plots of both books are strikingly similar, and Hunting & Fishing doesn't do anything new. Do we really need yet another book that tells us about the awful woes of being single and in one's late twenties? I think not."
4,intelligent and readable,I read it practially in one sitting. sharp stories with which any woman can relate.
5,Easy reading at its best,"The voice of the main character, her wit, sarcasm and insecurity ring true in this bestseller. I highly recommend this to any woman who likes a catchy smart-alek type novel. Also very endearing. I suggest this to all my friends!"
5,wonderful book!!,I wasn't sure if I was going to like this book when I started it. I was so wrong. The way the author writes each chapter keeps it interesting.
4,Wonderful summer reading,"I will be brief and to the point--its a wonderful, easy summer read that women will understand. Anyone who has read, and been hurt by, ""The Rules"" will laugh at the last story. You will not find any life-altering truths in the book, but it will make you smile. And in the middle of August at the beach, that is what I wanted."
3,Not what I expected...,"I think there is definitely too much publicity surrounding this book... I have to admit that one of the key factors of me buying this book were the excellent reviews it got.. Honestly, I didn't like it. I kept waiting for it to start. I didn't think it was funny either... It was actually sad... It's just another ""lonely woman in New York searching for true love"" book."
3,Woman to woman....you covered everything....congratulations!,Congratulations on your debut! It's fantastic. I read the novel in two days and really enjoyed it. Especially the way how Jane grew to becoming an adult. With especially her brother and Archie surrounding her that wasn't so easy. Not really thé role models! The finishing touch was the last chapter. Robert! That's the way women nowadays consider men. We have great expectations about the way they're gonna act in a life time relationship. When it comes to it they don't really know how to act on commitment. That's also the fact in Yolanda Joe's He Say She Say and Jane Green's Mr. Maybe. Ms Banks keep up the good work!
5,The mocking of the rules,"I read through the other reviews of this book and while I agree this is not a masterpiece, I don't think its intended to be. Its a light hearted beach read meant for summer, not a book to have dissertations based upon. Enjoy it for what it is, especially the final section where Jane gets seemingly schizophrenic over the Rules- very, very funny."
4,A quick light-hearted read.,After reading more serious works this summer I was in the mood for something light and fast. TGGTHF was the answer - finished it in under 24 hours and turned the last page feeling good and upbeat. Having read many of the poor reviews here I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. It's a just-for-fun book and worth the time.
3,"An enjoyable read, I just didn't relate","As a single woman in New York City, also working in publishing, like the narrator of the story, I was very interested in this book I heard so much about. It's a nice story, and there are elements to which I could relate. I also like the ""hunting and fishing"" analogies throughout the book. I liked the book, I just expected something more emotionally and intellectually insightful and that it quite wasn't."
4,A good read,"Two of my friends told me that this book was hilarious, but I never laughed once. I thought it was touching and poignant, but I missed the humor. It was an easy read. I really do not have much in common with the characters in this story. They are all from the Northeast and those Ivy League colleges. I'm also quite a bit older than Jane and her friends. I thought they all slept around too much. I would like to think that Jane finally met her Prince Charming, but I noticed that her older brother had another new girlfriend when the story ended. I had the feeling they would never settle down and get married."
4,"thoroughly enjoyable, even through the second read","Melissa Bank uses language and imagery to contemporary perfection. The collection of stories has a light, accessible summer-read quality that kept me as engaged now, listening to the audiobook, as it did when I read the book 10 years ago.If you love intelligent writing, playful use of wit and sarcasm, and insightful explorations of the contemporary human experiences of love, work and family, I suggest you try this book. The narration of the audiobook was also very good.Enjoy!"
2,Mixed reaction,"The author is clearly talented at creating character and story, no moreso than with her heroine Jane and her literary lover Archie, which to no surprise became the subject of a movie. Archie really was the most realized character, and I loved their relationship. I also like her relationship with her family. But the final part totally lost me - I felt like, ""What book am I reading, here?"" Actually I also felt that with the first departure into a short on presumably Jane and her future family. Who was the dad? What? Totally disembodied from the rest of the book - as was the final segment, which was the titled part. But definitely a talented writer who I'd gladly read again."
3,Great One-Liners,"Funny, charming, lightweight and full of clever one-liners - a bit Carrie Bradshaw-ish. I'd read another book by this author just for the fun of it."
3,Feel Good Happy Ending,"Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing is the story of Jane Rosenal's lessons learned and quest for true love.The book is broken down into short stories all tied together. In the first, we meet 14 year old Janie who learns lessons in love from watching her older brother Henry and the girlfriend he brings home for the family to meet. The stories that follow are Jane's search for happiness, the perfect job and the perfect man. In the last story Jane follows the ""Rules"" she learns from the guide and almost runs off the man of her dreams. After throwing the ""Rules"" out of the window she finally achieves her goal and lands Mr. Perfect.Girls' Guide is a feel good story with many funny lines and a happy ending."
4,an easy read... but,"this book wasn't all that it was hyped up to be. i was looking forward to a laugh, a giggle, some tears but the whole time i seemed to be waiting for that great moment. it didn't come. However i really liked the main character and the way the book was written. it's style i should say. it had it's little moments. i just felt a little let down by all the reviews."
4,Some very good stories,"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I would have just bought this book to read ""The Worst Thing a Suburban Girl Could Imagine"". This was a very good book, but I did have a few problems with it. One, I did not understand why the story of Nina was put into the book. I have been reading it over and over to see if that story had any relevance in Jane's life. The last story which was the title story did not do justice for the character of Jane. Jane became Bridgete Jones. I love both Bridgete and Jane, but I did not like Jane becoming Bridgete. Know what I mean? At the end of the book, Jane was a totally different person."
1,Disappointed in S.F.,"What are we missing? Scratching the surface, but never had any depth. Who is coming of age in THIS America? In this book club of 30 - somethings we found very little to relate to. Jane never found, or even looked for, herself. We looked for her""self"" as well. It's amazing what a good title, a Fargo-esque cover, and glowing big name reviews can do. Jane was very passive and accepting of what came to her. She may have been fishing but it was in a very shallow fishing hole. Melissa Banks offered us no real insight into who Jane was, how she felt, or what she wanted. The only time there was a hope of a connection with Jane was in the first chapter. Whatever happened to teenage Jane?"
3,"Entertaining, but not a keeper.","This book is a light entertaining read (I finished it in one afternoon). Jane's adventures and misadventures in love are stories that ring true with me. The best parts were 14-year-old Jane's observations about her brother's first serious relationship, and the hilarious Faith and Bonnie advice near the end of the book (obviously based on the authors of ""The Rules."")However, there was too much time spent on Archie--the alcoholic, boring lover who's almost 30 years older than Jane, and not enough time on the boyfriend who was with her during her fight against breast cancer. Surely someone who's with you at such a life-altering time deserves more press! The chapter about the neighbors was also completely unnecessary.This is a fun book to read, but pick it up at the library or a second hand store--don't pay full price."
3,A good story with too many cute endings,I loved reading this book. I think this book is a good start for a promising author. We should all look for her in the future.
4,A well-rounded read,"While I was expecting this book to be much more lighthearted and funny, I was not disappointed in its presentation. I felt there was a deeper understanding and empathy since this woman could be any one of us. I also enjoyed how, unlike many books today, this was not centered on her desire to find HIM. It showed her career, health and family. And most important, 'So you have him, but do you want to keep him?'"
1,Unimaginative,"There are many new, skillfully-written books of short stories by women this summer. But I'm surprised Bank's flat style is commanding so much attention. I found the characters thin and the language unimaginative. Do yourself a favor and read Stacey Richter's ""My Date with Satan"" and Julia Slavin's ""The Woman who Cut Off Her Leg at the Maidstone Club."" They are the real works of art that stand apart from the contrived, overhyped ""genre"" of ""girl fiction."""
2,An obvious first attempt,"This book is an obvious first attempt from a writer of magazine columns. The characters lack any depth what-so-ever, which makes you happy it's a fast read. If you're looking for something you don't have to think about from a fairly sarcastic first person perspective, you'll love this book."
4,Very witty and moving book by young author,"This book was so much BETTER than Bridget Jones, I cannot even believe the reviews on this page! I returned Bridget Jones to the store after four pages...YUCK, drivel...maybe if you are in EXACTLY the same situation as she is, but many of us are NOT and still read, and for those of you who can manage enough imagination to want to read about a life different than your own, GIRLS' GUIDE is far superior. Some of the less smooth aspects of the book keep me unsure if it's really a 3 star rating rather than a 4 star rating (Anna Karenina is a 5 star rating, but there's so much grade inflation on these writeups that I didn't want the book to look like a loser.)It's a quick, relatively light read, with a little more weight than I expected when I picked it up, and I thought it offered a fresh perspective on the relationships between and among friends, lovers, siblings, and parents."
3,What would Mimi think,"All I could think of is what would Jane's boss, Mimi, think of the editor of this book. I think she would say, as do I, what were you doing when you were supposed to be reading the chapter about Nina and her son Barney? I kept trying to figure out what they were even doing in this book and who they were. This book is perfect without this chapter, what a waste of time this chapter was. I think if she was going to write about these people she should have tied them in better. Maybe a chapter was edited out....! This book could easily have been 5 stars. Possibly the hard cover edition is different. Was it a misprint?"
2,Not what its hyped to be,"I was very dissappointed in this book. The protagonist is a whiney person, who really can't figure out what she wants in life. There is a chapter in the middle that doesn't even relate to the rest of the book. To call this a novel, is a farce, it is a series of vignettes that do not flow all that well. The dialogue is weak.The best part of the book is the last chapter. This could have been a decent short story. None of the rest of the chapters even related to the title."
4,funny girls need love too.,"read this before bridget jones' diary or tama janowitz's a certain age and definitley before ""the rules."" actually, don't read the rules. bank is an amazing writer and is funny and sarcastic she is pretty spot on about some things. but the best thing is that she encourages funny girls to be funny and not subdue it just so boys will like them."
2,Great Disappointment,"I was quite disappointed in this book. I was very anxious to start reading this book after I had heard wonderful things about it. As Bank wrote on and on about Jane's life, I felt like it was a chore to continute reading though. I never felt connected with Jane throughout her perilous love and career lives. I found all of the stories on brother's girlfriends and neighbor's personal lives unimportant and unrealistic. The plot did not flow smoothly either. I felt huge gaps from one section to the next. If Bank's perrogative was to reflect love and understanding, I don't think this book was quite right. I commend her on her creativeness, no one I know could come up with some of Jane's experiences, but am not very pleased with this novel."
1,You-go-girl drivel.,"This is an astoundingly simple-minded piece of trash. This ""book"" is a compilation of short sentences, short paragraphs and lots of adolescent one-liners. This would be a good effort for a high school sophomore. I'm not surprised that it was somehow published or even that it has become a best-seller, but this drivel was given feature reviews by the New York Times and the New Yorker. Is this what we've come to? Save your money, buy a romance novel and pencil-in your own one-liners."
2,Lukewarm Lorrie Moore - truly hoped it would be better.,"If you liked this book, please refer to Lorrie Moore's Self Help. Moore's take on love is so much more refreshing and original. What truly frustrated me about this first novel is how little work meant to the narrator. It's as if she had little in her life except worrying about her boyfriend. At least Bridget Jones had a funny job with interesting office mates. I found the men in this novel particularly indistinguishable. In the end, I didn't care for Jane, and her grating one liners. I truly hoped it would have been a much more ambitious and sophisticated novel."
2,huh?!,"I wanted to like this book. i really really did. But I was so confused by the switching around of the narrator's life (one minute she's 14, the next she's a grandmother, the next she's in her 30s...) that I simply couldn't erase the confused ""but...wait..."" from my mind as I read it, which is a rather distracting way to read a book."
2,"Clever, witty, soporific fluff.","If Elaine Benes, of ""Seinfield,"" in one of her dreamy moony moods wrote a book, this would be it. The one liners come fast and often, and you keep thinking, ""Ah, there's an end to that conversation, or that reverie,"" but it goes on and on, until you find yourself falling asleep (laughing all the way). As Melissa is, to the bank. What fools these publishers be!"
2,A Book You Could Keep or Throw Back,"(I'd give it 2 and 1/2 stars to be exact) The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing consists of 7 chapters- each that reads like its own short story- that follows one woman's relationships throughout her life. However, given that as the link, two of the stories don't really fit with the others. It's a very quick and easy book to read. It is also one of those oddities that entertain you okay while you are reading it, but once you put it down (and there are lots of good stopping points) you do not have an overwhelming desire to pick it up again."
3,Okay...not what I was expecting.,"It was interesting and reading it did not feel like a waste of time, but I have certainly read better. Bank's humor was not my sense of humor...I did not feel like I really gained anything from reading this novel."
3,Decent Book...if you get it cheap buy it!,"Well this is my first Steig book review coming from one of his biggest fans. Lets be honest, if you are thinking about purchasing his its probably because you love William Steig's work. You should know first off that this book is NOT in color. The book jacket on the front is but that is all that is in color. For me, that knocked it down a star. Basically this book is a series of poems by Jeanne Steig about Old Testament stories. Many of them are very catchy and most of them rhyme, but this is really just a book for fun. You will see similarities to William Steig's writing...sometimes there are large vocabulary words. All in all its an ok book but not the best really unless you are a collector of W. Steig's work like I am. I can't think of any other reason to buy the book unless you are a fan of his work."
1,ID Not Science,"I'm sorry to break it to you guys, but anyone who thinks that this book is a sucessful exercise in expressing the intelligent design theory in scientific terms has been woefully mislead. Dembski uses scientific terms to ATTEMPT to explain the creationist point of view, but intelligent design is simply NOT SCIENCE. This is not a matter for discussion, any more than one could discuss using mathematics to define religion. The two fields simply do not work together. If you don't believe me, then you haven't read enough about science to really understand what it is.In terms of philosphy and science, ID has been shown to be fallacious, and since Dembski clearly has a religious agenda (i.e. Christian agenda), he should not be allowed to call ID any kind of science, and you people should certaintly not believe him when he says that it is."
4,"Good, but difficult for general public to digest easily","Dembski has put his obvious intelligence to good use in explaining, in scientific terms, the theory of intelligent design. Two caveats: One, while this book fills an important niche by approaching the subject from a purely scientific point of view, the presentation makes it difficult for non-scientists to digest. Be prepared to re-read paragraphs that you don't comprehend fully at first. Two, Dembski frequently uses examples from Christianity in illustrating his points. As a non-Christian who nevertheless believes in God, I would have preferred less belief system-specific examples. Though, if you can accept that he is using convenient elements from the most common religion in the English-speaking world, and not prosletyzing, this shouldn't be much of a problem."
3,Intellegent Design-Cursory Review,"Dr. Dembsky states that the actual theory is fairly technical, and he does not actually attempt more than a conceptual presentation. For me the level of presentation was not adequate, and I found the book disappointing. This is an emotional subject, but I found the extensive amount of text devoted to criticism of his opponents to seriously degrade the quality of the book."
1,Laughable,"The title alone should win this guy some kind of award for humor. ""The Bridge Between Science and Religion""....really?This is on par with stating that the bombing of Pearl Harbor improved our relations with Japan."
1,Dishonest,"The author begins with biblical semiology (i.e., prophesy) and a defense of miracles (which already disqualifies the text as scientific), as well as a tendentious and loaded reappraisal of ""naturalism"". And it goes bad from there. Apparently, our philosopher hasn't heard of ""begging the question"", which is, BTW, a logical FALLACY.The book is purely and simply propaganda. I was hoping for something that would allow me to at least respect the position. I am, however, even more scared to death of these folks."
5,empirical evidence,"It is difficult to deny empirical evidence and first hand observation, the primary tools of scientific discovery."
4,A Valid Viewpoint,"Dembski presents a valid argument here for intelligent design theory. Though not foolproof, he lays out many different evidences for consideration of his idea, as well as for the Christian faith. Some of which are now standard arguments for design theorists. His views are not unintelligent, as some other reviewers have said. They express something which I believe is an interesting take on the coming about of existence. Though I'm not absolutely sold on his argument, the book made for a thoughtful read that I'm sure any open-minded reader would find engaging."
2,Many careers with just general info,"Although Mr. Ackerman lists many federal law enforcementcareers, the information is all basic. If you are looking for indepth information on specific careers this is not the book foryou. ..."
5,AMAZING,"What an amazing book. There is just volumes of tips, info and jobs that I didn't even know were out there. With this book, I know that I will have the knowledge that's needed to land a federal job.If you want to be in a federal position, this is THE BOOK for you. I carry it around everyone...can't put it down."
1,Basic Information Only,"As an listing of available jobs this book is great. But for specific information, it really stinks. Basically this book is a listing of jobs and descriptions of those jobs. Each position is given a little under a page and gives a general description of the job only. This book does not go into specific strategies as how to get these jobs (other than know someone, stand out, have previous experience, etc.) You could literally go onto the web and search for these jobs and have more information. ...My recommendation is to go to your library or bookstore and flip through it rather than buy it."
2,tons of jobs i didn't even know about!,"the good: ackerman does a great job of summarizing all of the federal law enforcement jobs out there. there were a lot of jobs i didn't even know about before reading. the not so good: i bought the book with the hope of getting a lot of useful hints for passing the written tests and personal interviews, but found it didn't provide as much information as i had thought (still got a job though!). buy the book if you want lists and descriptions of nearly every fed law enforcement job out there. don't buy it for the ""sure fire tactics for getting hired."""
1,Outdated inormation,"This edition is too old to be useful. Get the 2006 edition by Ackerman, also sold by Amazon.The new edition is excellent and has all the huge changes in Federal Law Enforcement since 9/11 and the formation of Homeland Security. New agency names, new organizational structure, new priorities, all that is in the new edition and not in this one."
3,"Not perfectly accurate, but it is still a good resourse",Some positions mentioned in the book are not quite up to date. Some requirements are not listed for a handful of positions. Comes close to matching the information on the agencies' website.
2,Same old POP,"The problem with most pop singers is they try to imitate one another, in the end everyone sounds the same. Why not do something original ?"
1,Disappointing.,The quality of the blanket was very disappointing - very light and full of static. I amnow using it in the car for my dog.
3,Corsa exhaust,"Installed on 2010 ZR1. Well made, no drone. Noise level goses up inside car. Not bad enough to go back to stock exhaust. Very nice tone, and good bark when you get on it. Nicer sound than stock. One thing Corsa doesn't tell you or show it the audio sound clips is the popping sounds when you let up off the gas when you shift. None of the retailers seem to want to tell you either. This system also fits the ZO6 which doesn't seem to have the popping and backrapping problem that the supercharged ZR1 has. Not sure I would change it out again. Expensive change out just for just different exhaust note."
3,Worth trying it,With 9 cell batter one should expect at least 6-8 hours battery life but it just gives me max 3 1/2 hours battery life.
1,READ THE BOOK INSTEAD,"I read the book and looked forward to sharing the video with my husband. His comment was ""I am sure the book was much better"". I told him it was. Don't waste your time. Read the book instead - it is really good!"
5,Rage of Angels,"Jaclyn Smith was the girlfriend of a well-known personality who was married with one child. They were very much in-love with each other. Jaclyn was trying to avoid him although she loves him very much, because of the guys status (married). The guy loves her very much too, that he sneaks out from his wife to meet her. The last meeting was arranged by the well-known personality guy and jaclyn was picked up by his men to meet him.Years later, the guy was with his family and he saw Jaclyn walking with a boy (without knowing was his son).Note :I have been looking for this movie for a long time for my collection. I saw this movie in Dubai, United Arab Emirates last 18 years ago."
4,Good introduction to Fibonacci Numbers for younger readers,"This book is well-crafted and interesting. It should hold the interest of all beginners in this topic.It is not without its faults, however. As discussed in my book Fractals in Music, the analysis of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony as based on Fibonacci numbers is not correct."
5,Great Stools,I had some stools from target that were about $30 each and these are MUCH better. They are very sturdy (I'm 220 pounds). I notice a warning on the bottom saying its only been tested for up to 250 pounds. They look great. I polished the seats with furniture polish and they look great. But now I slip off of them like an egg in a non stick pan! :)
5,"""September Gurls"" Rocks My World !!!","This is a great CD! These songs are wonderful choices and are done in that pure Bangles ""love of the music"" style! I wish there was more of the same type songs on here but, hey, that quibble aside I wouldn't add the ""Flame"" and ""Egyptian"" songs, as they don't fit the feel here. This is the type of music that brought them together in the first place! This September boy's got it bad for ""September Gurls""."
1,LIKE CHICKEN SOUP WITHOUT THE CHICKEN,"This bland, tired, tepid collection is like chicken soup without the chicken. A vital element is missing."
1,SCREWED TWICE,Ordered this item- received item with 2 knives missing and the scissors were an off brand.Called and they said they would ship another order-received order- 2 KNIVES ARE MISSING AGAIN !!! and the scissors are an OFF BRAND !!!! It was SHRINK WRAPPED LIKE THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE !!! I am so angry !!!!! I just want my money back !!!!
5,Great Knives,Fantastic knife set. Bought one for my sister one for me. Turned into nice christmas presents. I would recommend for more advanced kitchen cooksre
2,item under review,I was interested in this item. I read one or two reviews about the knifes not fitting the block or not coming with the correct amount of knives.I think the problem is the wrong block is being used.[...]the knives are good but sent with wrong block if im correct.
3,Better deal to purchase separately,"What is good:Chef's knifeBread knifeParing knifewhich you can buy all three for about $50.00You also get a boning knife which you may or may not use a lot. You get a slicing knife that looks like a cake icer, but one side is sharp, you'd be better off getting the granton edge slicer or a serrated one. Other than that you are getting a block (buy the Kapoosh Universal knife block for $30 - rated highest by Cooks Illustrated), kitchens scissors and a sharpening steel which all can be gotten for dirt cheap. You only have two open spaces on the knife block, so you can't expand much either.Go to Cooks Illustrated and look on Amazon to see the best individual knifes and you will have exactly the knives you want for a cheaper price."
5,Wedding gift for daughter,"I have used this brand for going on 45 years, and when it came time to pick out something for my daughters wedding, I immediately thought of these knives. PS I carried them all the way to New Zealand where my daughter lives. She was thrilled."
2,Picture is very misleading,I ordered this knife set after reading several reviews on other sites about how this knife set is great for someone on a budget and looking to go above Victorinox's 3 piece set for $50. When I got the set though I was very disappointed to see that there are only 5 actual knives in the set and that the picture is misleading in how many knives you get. I have returned this set in favor of getting 2 3 piece sets which will save me $50 and give me one more actual knive.
5,Victorinox 8-Piece Knife Block Set - through Amazon.com,"My wife has always wanted a good knife set. She is amazed at the high quality & sharpness of the set. If she's happy, I'm happy, so this is a 5 star report.Sincerely,Mr Happy :-]"
5,Best Knives,"These are the BEST knives and quite possibly the ONLY knives I'll ever use again!Sharp, they hold a great edge, sharpen easily and will cut paper thin slices from the softest of tomatoes. The bread knives work great on any bread... I can't say enough about these knives other than if you don't have a set yet, get on it!"
5,Dangerously sharp!,"I bought this along with Victorinox's Santoku knife as a gift to my beloved boyfriend. He loves to cook and is just so frustrated with dull knives in the kitchen. We are no professionals when it comes to reviewing knives...but let me tell you this...He used the chef's knife and splitted the durable plastic wrapper of the santoku knife in half with one clean cut!! Did I mention that it was effortless?! If it can cut through hard plastic, it can cut through anything. Since then, I have been very nervous everytime he uses these knives. Overall, we are very satisfied. We thought Victorinox could include a few steak knives to this set so we don't have to buy separate ones and keep them in the drawer. Great price for a great set of knives."
4,"Very nice set, biggest knife is the tiniest bit flimsy","I do love this knife set, especially for the price. The knife block looks awesome, everything works as expected, and it's a joy to cook with. I slice through meat, veggies, and everything else without problem, and very neatly. My one issue is that the biggest knife seems a little bit flimsy. I don't know if my cutting block is the issue (plastic, not wood), which may well be, but it doesn't seem to have the thickness I expect. Maybe I'm just used to dull knives, though. In all, I recommend the set, especially for the price. I'm sure you already know how highly rated this set is by knife appraisers."
3,Great knives - wrong kitchen shears,"The knives were as advertised - online and on the box. The kitchen shears, however, were advertised on the box to be made in Germany, while the shears themselves had ""Made in France"" clearly printed on them and were not of a good quality. The shear's blades were cheaply done and the overall quality was low. I did not want to return the whole set just for the shears. A little disappointed that Victorinox had such low quality control on the set."
5,Just what the cook ordered,"Great set of knives. I did a lot of research on affordable knife sets and this was one of the most recommended. I was a little hesitant to pick up decent knives that where not forged, but this set has been great. The price (especially on Amazon) is unbeatable for the quality. I can't comment on longevity, but with proper care they seem quite durable. If you are tired of using a lot of force while cutting due to dull knives, I can't recommend these enough."
5,Amazing,"These knifes are great - they save me 10-15 minutes every time I make a salad or cook anything.Before ordering I read other reviews - one point I want to make is that this set has exactly the knifes I need.The chef's knife, BTW, was voted as the best by Cooks Illustrated. The bread knife is very useful obviously, so is the paring knife. The slicer is extraordinary - makes paper-thin slices of tomato, onion, smoked fish, etc..And the boning knife is great for meat and chicken trimming. Go for it! You won't be disappointed."
5,all sceptics of satanic abuse must read this book!!!,This is a outstanding book that exposes what some of us have known all along.there are satanic cults and yes there is such a thing as satanic child abuse and childern sex rings.and worst of all those taking part in the activities of this sick world can at times be leaders with power placed there by these occultists to block being caught.A great read.
5,Awesome,"Nothing but good things to say. First off - the delivery by the seller and amazon was unbeatable. I never have to worry about late arrivals with amazon - they are always early. Secondly I would like to say that this book has changed my life - I will never look at things the same way as I did before reading it. Obviously this is more of a review on the book as opposed to the product's condition or the delivery process, but it only makes me happier about the entire ordeal. Awesome."
4,What did you expect was the real problem?,"Stuck at the airport in Sweden for almost an entire week waiting for my flight back to the US, I am reminded of this book as I see the only regular daily flight out is to tailand, the line filled with the seediest characters.Politicians are actors and the T.V. is their stage. Corporations protect thier members interests and I don't mean money.Honestly, one only has to visit down-town China town to realize cannabalism, orgies and human sacrifice are the norm."
4,"Another very fine, but disturbing book about the problems with 'the two party system'...","Fact: The US of A was actually founded witha three party, not two party sytem! The De-mocratic/Republicans were once one party!Fact: According to our Constitution, Weare a Constitutional Republic, not a so-called'Demo(n)cracy! Former Congressman and AttorneyJohn W. DeCamp was a guest of the very fineRadio Free America show of Tom Valentine manytimes in the 1990's. He details how kidnappedand runaway boys are used as sex slaves andsacrificed in satanic rituals for REPUBLICANSen(s) and Congressman at parties and killedfor 'Snuff Films', as in Snuffed out, as inDead. Drug Running, et, al, happens under ournoses, but the Phony ""War on Drugs"" [""Show noMercy"" -George Herbert Walker Bush (The Elder)].Waht a bunch of 'Bushlip'! Read this, Mr and MrsAmerica!"
5,Had to read entire book in one sitting,"If people on the East and West Coasts think Nebraska is still in the 1950s, this book will definitely serve as a wake up call."
2,Someone is sick...,"Someone claiming to be researching ""what happened to her"" as a child came into a forum and started spouting a bunch of nonsense about unrelated things and Jewish Satanism (oxymoron much) that sounded like a bunch of clap-trap conspiriacy theory. She said her story could be found in this book. Someone cries for attention, someone wants to stir up trouble, and someone is trying to sell a book. It's sad that people want attention that badly."
1,Not worth anyone's time,"This was an unfortunate waste of time. Not only is the tone of the book rather unbalanced, I suspect the writer is also a bit ""off"". Facts are distorted, rumors are held as truths, and so on. Nebraska as the center of satanic cults? One very kooky book. Only for the gullible."
1,Heavy Reading for L:ightweight Intellects,"John DeCamp knows his audience -- ignorant, paranoid, gullible,insecure, and feeble-minded -- and this book plays right to them. DeCamp's halucinations have been thoroughly discredited by virtually everyone who has heard them; a grand jury, federal and state investigators, and just ordinary citizens with the enough sense to come in out of the rain. Reading this book, I got dizzy from all the absurdity. Keeping up with the labyrinthine plots, sub-plots, names, places and acts was all but impossible. It brought to mind that TV series ""Picket Fences."" But at least the writers admitted that show was a comedy. DeCamp's vivid, highly descriptive, almost worshipful descritions of acts allegedly carried out against children was so creepy that it makes you wonder about what kind of sickness is rattling around in the author's head. Instead of spending nine bucks for this craziness, donate it instead to a mental health charity. You'll feel better about yourself."
4,"In the summertime, my family suffers from bug ...","In the summertime, my family suffers from bug bites. Aveeno has really helped with our itching. It dries quickly compared to the cortisone gels I've used and it doesn't rub off and get all over our clothes."
1,not effective for me,The packaging and delivery time were excellent. But it was not effective for my rashes. Other Aveeno product like skin relief ones has been a great product for their own purpose though and I have been using them for a few years.
3,Didn't work,This didn't work for my pregnancy hives. Now I have two and a half bottles of product just sitting there. This is the same product as the little tubes that they sell at target for bug bites. I wish I realized that before I decided to buy these 3 so I wouldn't have wasted my money. Oh well. I'm sure this is a good product for some if you need it in mass quantity. Try those little tubes at the store first though!
3,This product wasn't my favorite for controlling itches. ...,"This product wasn't my favorite for controlling itches. While it stopped the itching, the consistency of the product left a chalky appearance on my skin and didn't rub in very well. I probably wouldn't recommend this to friends or family, and probably wouldn't purchase again unless its consistency was changed. It's too much like calamine lotion."
5,"Aveeno Anti-Itch Concentrated Lotion, 4 Ounce","I love Aveeno Anti-Itch Concentrated Lotion!I'm super allergic person. So I need somethingthat's non-allergic. This one seems to work.I love it,Takako Masuda"
4,"So, so","I personally don't like smell and color of calamine, it works equally well. I like the cap so it will never pump out"
5,I tested this product during a great time ...,"I tested this product during a great time -- summer rash season! It felt good on my skin, without any overpowering odors. It also made my skin feel smooth and less prone to itching. My son, who has sensitive skin, also used it with no problems or allergic reactions, and found a lot of relief from his various skin """"itchies."""" I'll be buying more as soon as this bottle is gone. I really feel it did what it said it would do. We're very pleased with this product and will recommend it to others."
4,Itch gone?,I had a allergic reaction to a new detergent and i bought this to use on my rashes. it helps stop the itches but if you mess with the rash no amount of lotion is gonna help. This stuff is pretty sticky too so try not to use it on your whole limb.
3,This product worked well for me. It moisturized ...,This product worked well for me. It moisturized as well as controlled my itches. The one thing I didn't like about the lotion was the odor. It's too strong and smell too medicinal.
4,The Secret of the Forgotten City,"Nancy Drew is a young detective. Nancy usually helps her father, Carson Drew, with his cases. Nancy's mystery all starts when she heard rumors that long ago there was a treasure hidden in a city that is now buried under the Nevada Desert. Nancy and her friends, Bess, George, Ned, Burt, and Dave, plan to join a dig sponsored by two colleges to hunt for the gold. Before Nancy starts, she receives an ancient tablet with petroglyphs carved on it. But with the clue from the tablet, a thief also wants the treasure and brings threat and danger to Nancy and her friends.One stressful adventure after another overwhelmed Nancy and her friends in 102-degree temperature as they follow Nancy's guesses above and below ground. They are assisted by a Indian woman and a young geology student. In the end Nancy and Ned almost lose their lives, just after Nancy has discovered the precious hidden treasure of gold under the Nevada Desert."
5,Why you would like this book,"I had an assignment in my English class to read this book. Well, at first I was just like, oh great another boring book to read, but that changed. As I began to read I instantly became attached. When it was time to stop reading for the day I just wanted to keep on reading. Carolyn Keene wrote this book well. This page turning book grasps your interest within just a few chapters. I would highly recommend this book! Read it well!:).....oh im 14 y/o....."
3,Not a top-rate ND story,"I liked this book, but the story was kind of dull. Nancy and her friends are trying to solve a mystery built on a legend and they find an abandoned city. This story is not as good as most of the early hardback Nancy Drew books."
2,overrated,I got a copy of this book for $2 used and that was the right price. It went on and on for pages about one little detail and didnt tell me anything I wanted to know. Save your money for some other book. Other books are better and talk about more than putting silver leaf on ashes. Puh! No cones just charcoal. No herbs just stuff that no american can find.Like the others said this book is short and thats it only saving grace. find another book unless you live in japan.
5,You Don't Have to Love Comics,"I couldn't disagree more with the reviewer who dismissed this clever, funny, and insightful work as boring and unworthy. OK, it's NOT great literature and there are certainly more scholarly books out there to read if you want to work on enhancing your creativity, but let's not be snobbish about this: the book is a fast, fun read the first time through and delivers even more rewards when you go back to it. Madden is a talented cartoonist, and his purposeful imitations of the styles of other famous cartoonists is used to great effect in some of the exercises.Did this loosen me up and make me more creative? Am I now ready to write the great American novel? Well, not yet. But it has gotten me thinking about new approaches to plotting and characterization, and I think that's the whole point. Thanks, Matt!"
2,Disappointing,"While I must admit there is SOME creativity, a bit of cleverness, and a few useful ideas in this book, it truly felt more like ""exercises in trivial changes which do nothing for the story."" Madden fills much of the book with very trite modifications to his original story ""template"". For every page that seems clever, there is at least one other that feels like a complete cop-out.As a story teller, I would be much more interested in seeing the actual story structure approached from various angles. Truly the possibilities are endless, even if the graphic style remained constant. So I would say the title of the book is a bit misleading. It should be something like ""99 Ways to draw a comic with no meaningful consequence to the story"". This really is about graphic style, not story."
2,Boring and annoying,"The same one page action, told 99 times in 99 different ways (aka an exercise in style the Queneau way).When ""99 ways..."" got out, I was curious enough to buy it (and obviously read it). Also, I liked the idea at the base, and I usually love ""style exercises"". But. Matt Madden fails completely at this divertissement. After a few pages, the exercise becomes rhetorical, and it lacks the imagination and creativity it would need. Yes, there are many ideas, but almost all of them are carried out in a rather mechanical (and possibly dull) way. And even the few good ones look highly undeveloped. In the end it was not only boring to read, but worst: it was annoying.I would indeed recommend this book to people learning to make comics, but only to them. Though, given all the good reviews ""99 ways..."" got, maybe it's just me."
4,informative and extensive look on historical fashion!,"An informative and extensive look on historical fashion, this book is quite useful for Artists, historians, and fashion designers! Covers historical eras I seldom hear about!"
4,Bueno para consultar,"Es un libro de mucha ayuda para consultar sobre los diseños de los diferentes períodos de la historia, lo mejor es que no sólo tiene dibujos de la vestimenta de hombres y mujeres , sino que incluye además la de los niños en varias época, lo que es muy educativo."
1,bad idea,"I had to return this because it kept falling over, plus the soap dish part was too teensy for a regular bar of soap. It didn't work to hold shampoo as I'd hoped."
4,Excellent live cd,"This ia an excellent live cd but it isn't totally perfect so I'm not going to give it 5 stars but an excellent performance, however.I hadn't bought a saga recording since behaviour. I didn't even know they were still around until I got on the internet. Some of these songs I've never heard before such as the cross, welcome to the zoo, the security of illusion, heaven can wait, and five others. They are well done here and I'm currently looking for other saga cd's on the basis of hearing these tunes. The two video's are really good especially as far as the way they sound both from material from heads or tales. Times up is an accoustical version here. I f you like saga you'll like this cd."
4,Very good live cd,"This is very good live cd with some great live performances such as how long, the perfectionist, humble stance, welcome to the zoo( better than the studio version by far), the cross, the accoustic version of security of illusion, and framed. Some weak perfomances are scracthing the surface, on the loose , and wind him up. Well worth buying"
5,Too much praise too late...,"Hate. Sludge. Shriek. Repeat. The South OWNS. Alternative Tentacles has done sludge-riff loving freaks a great service by compiling out of print material by this legendary band...anyone familiar with the works of EYEHATEGOD, GRIEF or ""Through Silver in Blood"" by NEUROSIS should not be without this. After scaring the hell out of anyone within earshot throughout the early 90's, Buzzov-en combusted and joined the ranks of bands seen by few, yet years later revered by many (myself included). My first taste of these guys was 11 years ago when Roadrunner records released SORE-it made my head bang and my skin crawl-this collection also achieves this, added with a sense of loss for what I never got to see. On a side note, allow me to add that I hate myself for leaving a show before Grief took the stage...oh, to be young and foolish...don't make the same mistakes, get this NOW, and check out WEEDEATER when they come to town. The riff has spoken, praise the riff."
5,By far the best book on Truk,"I would recommend this book to all divers and war history buffs interested in the wrecks of Truk. Especially for divers who are planning a trip to Truk. This is the perfect dive planning text for learning about the wrecks before the dives so divers can maximize their bottom time experience. Each wreck has its own chapter with maps and a guide to the highlights of the wreck. There are also photos of the wrecks before they sank and a history of each ship. After a trip to Truk, it is the perfect souvenir -- better than any details in log books! Lots of GREAT underwater wreck photography in color, too.Mike Zinsley, author of the Rapture of the Deep"
5,Outstanding Work for Divers and Historians,"I can't say enough good things about this book. It is an exemplary work that meets the needs of several audiences. With 250+ color and black&white photos (the majority being color), and 173 maps and illustrations, it has all the ""eye-candy"" anyone would ever want, and is handsome enough for display. Yet it is also incredibly detailed in its historical treatment, and provides the serious WWII historian with a wealth of useful, well-organized information on the battles around Truk. Anyone who is even moderately interested in Truk should own a copy--it is worth every single penny you'll spend on it. ""A+"" rating.."
5,How did i miss this guy !!,"Detroit boy and familiar with the local music scene here for a long time ( Old Miami, Blind Pig, Bakers, etc)and i never heard of this guy, how the HELL did i miss this guy. Big blues fan and my brother actually plays the harp in a local band, the back door blues band, have seen Buddy a few times and he is my fave, along with Robert Johnson, however Eddie Kirkland is now included, GET THIS CD !!. The first CD is more Delta traditional blues, it's a reissue of Front and center, and the second CD (reissue of deval and other blues demons)is a more electric R&B sound and it is my choice of the set.Highlights include Disc 1Goin' Back to Mississippi (Git work on this one is some of the heaviest i have ever heard)Detroit Rock IslandGoing to the River, See Can I Look AcrossDisc 2Hard to Raise a Family Today ( great lyrics, awesome song )Pity on Me ( great, great classic blues joint, great rhythm git)Mink Hollow Slide ( rippin slide work, makes you wish you could play like this )"
3,Wallace Sterling Hammered Frame 8 x 10,"This frame was a gift and I would have appreciated knowing before I placed the order that the inside silver was not attached and had a floating edge. For the cost of the frame, this was a big let down. I would have preferred to pay more to receive a traditionally formed frame with an anchored inside edge."
3,I'm Under Their Spell,"The recipe here is familiar...Take a heavy dose of Ozzy-era Sabbath...drop a hint of newer doom/stoner/sludge (Kyuss, Sleep)...stir and let bake...and what you get is a batch of Witch. And it tastes delicious. Not everything has to sound new and revolutionary and Witch certainly doesn't. Considering Sabbath, there have been bands who have done things the best, and why not follow the pattern of what works, but take it your own way.That's what you get here. Witch is definetly one of those bands who will get labelled a Sabbath rip-off, but for those who don't mind that comparison, this is another great stoner rock album. ""Seer"" and ""Changing"" are the two standout tracks on a rather short album, but that's not taking anything away from the rest of the tracks, which are all pretty solid. Not the best of this genre, but an enjoyable listen nonetheless."
4,good cd but not awesome !,Witch is a good band w/ J mascis on drums !from Dinosaur Jr fame ! SST records legend.like usual - J and crew are best to be seen live!pretty good metal CD !
1,I don't think so!,"Black Sabbath?......I don't think so. If you want to hear a band that is good at copying Black Sabbath guitar listen to the Melvins. The unique thing about Sabbath was they had everything,good vocals, great guitar, good bass and good drumming.This band does not have 3 out of 4 of these qualities. The guitar is just ok. Definetly no originality.You have to be high to understand the vocals. Sounds like he's singing in another room. Not cool."
5,A great addition to the yard,"This product offers a great value, was very easy to set-up and is a wonderful addition to anyone's yard. I had seen identical offerings on-line for twice the price and was hesitant to purchase the fountain figuring it would be a less expensive knock-off. In was indeed very wrong as it is the identical fountain that is offered at other retailers.The fountain was delivered in a matter of days from the time I placed my order and was very well packed. Set-up took about an hour after installing and leveling the base. I used a 18"" square concrete slab that I purchased at the local Lowes as a base. If you live in the colder weather states it is wise to keep the packing to store the fountain inside in the winter months."
3,Had to return,"The first surprise I had is that the fountain is delivered by a carrier service. The carrier services only works during the week and offered me two 4-hour windows to chose from - both of with conflict with a standard M-F workshift. I had to take a 1/2 day off of work to be at the house for delivery.The fountain was very well packaged and appeared easy to put together. After following the directions and placing the large bowl on the base pedistal you need to feed the power cord for the pump through a pipe. Apparently the original pipe was replaced (which isn't a big deal) but when they replaced it, they did so with a smaller diameter pipe. The new pipe is too small for the power cord plug to fit through. I am now in the process of packing it back up for return."
2,kinda,Setting up the foutain was easy. While setting it up you can see details where they have done patch work on cracks. I have made sure the ground was level. But the two top bowls are not level do to the mold or what ever they used to make it. I had put littel wedges under the middle bowl so the water will come down on both sides. Now only a month down the line and a few rains later you can see alot more cracks the rain had washed of the dust from them trying to conceal them. Beside that it's a good price.
2,Southern Patio 3 Tier Pinapple Fountain,Received Southern Patio Tier with hairline cracks. Tried to call customer service and was on hold for a very long time. When I was able to speak to a representative I was told that they did not see my purchase on record and the part of the fountain I wanted replaced I could not. I was advised that I should call the store that I purchased the fountain from. The only choice was to return the whole fountain. Returning the fountain I would have to pay additional cost. I purchased a sealer to cover the cracks and kept the fountain. Not pleased with this transaction and how everything was handled and will not use the web site again.
4,from fundamentals to politics,"This is a great find for anyone interested in the more theoretical underpinnings of graphic design and typography. From Foucault to Derrida, the authors sample a number of approaches towards the ""why"" behind the design of printed materials. Graphic designers will find great introductory resources on topics such as deconstructivism and the intellectual archaeology of design, whereas more politically minded souls will enjoy essays on race and sexuality in graphic design and advertising. A nicely done, eclectic reader."
5,"Outstanding, Beautiful Music!","This is one of the most beautiful albums that I've listened to. It's piano with orchestra, perfect for reading, relaxing, studying, or meditating, or just enjoying. The music is uplifting, complex, and despite my many repeated playings, it just doesn't seem to get stale. The recording quality is excellent with outstanding clarity and fidelity. The songs are complex and they evolve or develope, it's difficult to judge by a short example how enjoyable this music is. Highly recommended"
5,"Beautiful, relaxing CD!",This is well worth it if you enjoy piano music. Very happy with this purchase. I will be purchasing many more from this artist in the future.
2,easy-listening,"It's likely that I saw the label ""minimalist"" applied to Mr Einaudi & that's what led me to this CD. He is, from what I read, a successful & prolific composer & pianist but this is the first time I've heard him. This doesn't sound minimalist to me, nor does it belong in the classical genre. It could be categorized as ""easy-listening"" music: relaxing (to those who like this sort of thing) but shallow & with nothing interesting or inventive going on musically. It's well-done so I could readily recommend it to folks who like Yanni & Kenny G."
2,What does it do?,"Loaded fine. Tried to use it, but it never worked. Canon help desk, didn't help. I thought it was to allow reading bar codes printed on documents being scanned and then use the data to create a file name. It didn't work and Canon kept saying I should have some third party software. Then what do I need this software for?"
5,"Great Music, Great Price","This collection samples Clooney's work between 1951 and 1960; while hardly definitive, the performances include two duets with Bing Crosby as well as orchestras conducted by Pérez Prado, Nelson Riddle, and Billy May. One of Clooney's best-known tracks (""Mambo Italiano"") is missing, but you do get two songs in the same vein: ""Come On-A My House"" (co-written by Ross Bagdasarian aka David Seville of Chipmunks fame!) and ""Botch-A-Me"". Plus the latin arrangement of ""Mack the Knife"" makes even this old chestnut worth hearing again. The music and sound quality are both consistently good, making this compilation a great place to start and well worth the money."
5,One of my favorite bags.,"Has room for everything you might need. I carry my XTI, and 40D body, along with a set of Kenko extension tubes, 500D close up filter, batteries, 580ex II, filters/cleaning kit, 17-85 IS, 60mm macro, and the 75-300 III. I also carry a wind breaker and granola bars for hiking. It also comes with an exrtra battery for your 40D,30D or 20D, and a cheap Canon UV filter that is good for scraping off your boots after walking in the mud."
1,if you are over 40 skip it... so gen X,"This is a very shallow book by the new generation of writers that find fault with everything done in the twenty years before they were born,Its very shallow, big type and very preachy.If you are interested in gardening, try Giaas garden, a much more serious study of permiculture.In this rambling book, the aurthor boasts of not making over 8 k a year, but inherited the money to buy her farm!I liked camping living until I was thirty, now I am 45 and really like my freezer and new stove.( yes, I have my own three hens and belong to a CSA)I know a number of the original flower/farm people, and as they got older they liked having a few more comforts.So this is one of the new gen X books, shallow to a fault. Nothing but sound bites.the aurthor sems all hyped about third world living, but I am not sure she has ever been to a third world and seen how hard that style of life is,,it is easy to glamorius the distant!!!"

5,T-maxx engine,"Excelente producto el mismo se encontraba en excelente calidad y me llegó al tiempo que yo esperaba y completo,recomiendo mucho al vendedor, Gracias!Excellent product came at the time that it was waiting and complete,I recommend the seller, Thanks."
5,Excellent product from someone who makes her own lotions!,"I recently had a severe outbreak of psorisis. I used this lotion and the oilated oatmeal bath daily.It was very comforting to my outraged skin. I highly recommend Aveeno Oatmeal Products.If I see a friend with problems and I don't have time to go make them something, I hurry to the drugstore to pick up one of their products with oatmeal in it. It's perfect for itchy skin with the right balance of oils."
4,"Very good, except for the odour","The lotion is just perfect, but despite being odourless it does seem to have a certain chemical like odour which doesn't smell to good. But it does a great job at moisturizing the skin."
2,Do you shave your head?,"I do, and while I'm not sure if the label indicates that this is not a product for your face and scalp... it should! It felt great going on and for a few hours. But by late morning and for the whole rest of the day I felt like I was covered in grease. You know that feeling you get after eating really greasy fried food? That's the one! It was hard to even wash off. Instead of this I highly recommend the Dessert Essence Jojoba Oil instead (ASIN:B0000C0XL8). You only need a tiny little bit and it works wonders just after shaving my head and face."
1,"Appears safe, but we really do not know for sure","I was reading the label on this lotion the other day. I have been using this off and on for about a month or so. I never noticed before that it has a warning label on the back of the bottle. It says that this contains dimethicone and should after 7 days of use, you should see your doctor.I looked up dimethicone online. I saw that various websites have warnings that vary widely. They say anything from discontinue use after 7 days because it causes skin irritation to avoid completely, because it causes cancer. Maybe it does and maybe it does not. I am not willing to take that chance. I am throwing mine out and not buying it again."
5,Tons of Fun while Skill Building,My child is 6 and a very good swimmer / diver. We purchased these to help him practice his underwater skills and stamina and have fun while doing it. He loves the challenge of finding the bombs throughout the pool. He also enjoys the magnetic tag finding game with his friends. The water guns are just plain fun. This toy was a great purchase!
3,Wild Planet Outdoor Antics Pool Action Park,"We took this to Florida for our winter vacation. The kids did not pick up on the gloves. One grandaughter tried to pick up things at bottom of the pool, but could not get magnet to work. Maybe she had gloves on wrong. Will try them again this summer."
2,"Cheaply made, Kids seem to like em ok","A cheapo set of pool toys for a not so cheap price.I leave these down by the pool for the apartment kids to play with. They seem to like em. I bought them for my girlfriend and I.We like the dive balls, but the magnetic gloves barely fit most of the children, don't even think they'll fit your banana hands. The other toys aren't that great either, you could find cheaper entertainment by buying what you like at your local pool store. There are two squeeze bulbs to shoot water (lame), Tiny gloves with a magnet built in, and filter clogging fish magnets (lame), and some dead weight balls with neoprene streamers... the balls are worth it, but for $30, look elsewhere to enjoy your day at the pool.Not the best bang for the buck, was hoping for more fun from $30."
4,Great item!,"I bought this for my brother to replace his broken shower radio. I love that this has a CD player plus radio plus fog free mirror. The only thing I wish it had is a little shelf for soap or razor or whatever. His broken one had that and it was nice. His kids are jealous of his new radio / CD player and his 13 year old daughter tried to talk him into installing it in their bathroom. No go, but now I have an idea for her for Christmas :)"
1,Product in photo is not the same product that I received.,Received scissors more then 2 weeks after I ordered them. The scissors are not the same quality as the ones this company advertised. I already had a pair like the ones I ordered so it was easy to see that the ones I ordered and the one I received were not the same type. Not happy with this company and would like a refund. I will be happy to return for a full refund and free return shipping. We'll see how professional their customer service department is.
2,very difficult for small hands,"i bought a 1.99 pair of scissors at the super market and they are much better than these, and you can use them in the right or left hand. not worth it."
3,"Good scissors, for right-handed children.","I have multiple pairs of these scissors in my house. I like them, they last for years unlike the cheaper scissors. My right-handed child has no problem. They keep their edge, he can cut paper and foam with them.These are useless for the left-handed child. I thought my daughter could sue these, they say they are ambidextrous on the package, but as many have said, this is an impossibility with scissors. She would cut jagged lines in everything. This lead to her getting very frustrated. You can't find left-handed scissors in any local Brick-and-mortar stores it seems. Don't buy these for your left -handers. Fiskars makes a great pair of left handed scissors that is sold here on Amazon, that have all the benefits of these scissors."
1,Not Left Handed,"I thought I had found the perfect little scissors for my left-handed 4-year old granddaughter. Good size, nice grip, colorful, blunt. But no! Not true left hand scissors. I am angry enough to return these."
1,Surprisingly dissappointing,"As a former school teacher, I remember these scissors being one of the top choices for little kids. I'd also used them plenty, myself (though they're not ideal for big hands, of course) I didn't think twice about ordering them for my daughter's first pair of scissors. I was surprised to find them very hard to open and close- too much friction. That's just not workable for tiny hands relatively new to cutting."
1,cheap,These are cheap scissors and are likely to fall apart in a few weeks. I do not recommend this product.
2,Are these NEW???,"These scissors come in NO original packaging, I am wondering if they are even new?? Can't pick the color either so I see why they are cheap. Next time I would order elsewhere so I knew they were new and so I would get to choose the color. I have to say the shipping was not very fast either. This review is for the vendor (The Natural Health Shoppe) rather than the scissors."
4,"Simple, easy to use",I admit one can't really review a simple product like a scissors. I got this Fiskars for our toddler who likes to play-and-cut paper. It is simple and safe.Online delivery: great and timely.
5,Excellent scissors for children,"If you have kids and they like to do art projects, these scissors' fit the bill. The handle is easy for small hands to hold and the tip is nice and rounded. I can't imagine it made much safer."
1,No longer quality product,"I bought a pair of these scissors last year and they are great; its performance and fit-and-finish reflect the kind of quality you expect from Fiskars, even at such a low price point. I ordered two more pairs as extras and noticed that the handles look different than the pair I already have. I read the packaging and realized that these are now made in China (the first pair I got were made in the US) and unfortunately, quality has been severely affected. One pair wouldn't open/close with reasonable effort (young kids would struggle) and both pairs had sloppy flashing on the handles, making them scratchy. I am so disappointed. They have been returned and I will try and find these locally; hopefully the original ones are still available."
2,"Took a chance on ""assorted colors"" :(","Bummer! My son's school supply list specifically requested Fiskar scissors so I ordered these. Although I realized they came in ""assorted colors"", I ordered them in the hopes that they would arrive in a gender neutral color. Unfortunately, they came in a flaming hot pink and that just won't fly for my little guy. I ended up giving them to a neighbor girl so she could have them for school. It's really too bad that the customer cannot order the color of their choice. For that reason, I am giving 2 stars. On a side note, I believe Fiskar scissors are very well made and durable."
4,My kids love it,Pro:Well designed. The rubber handles are comfortable. My kids said they look like rubber candies.Con: Not sharp enough. Have to press it hard.
4,Just right for 3-year old,"The little 3-year old is learning to cut things out, and these scissors are just right for her. She's proud to have her 'own' scissors, tho I don't let her keep them in her toys, she has to use them when I'm with her."
2,DULL,DullThe book Muhammad Ali: Champion is a boring biography of Muhammad Ali. This book tells about what Ali has been through and mainly about his boxing career.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. If you've heard of Ali and want to know more about him this would not be the book to get. Once you start reading this book it's kind of interesting but as you get to the middle it gets slow. I didn't this book because as I was reading it I lost my interest.
1,never buy from these people,"It was over 2 weeks before I received my order and when it arrived, pieces were missing. I called and they sent replacement parts. The car holder for my palm that I bought broke the first time that I used it and the case that I purchased does not fit. What a waste of money. I will classify this as a lesson learned."
2,ok bundle,Most of the items in this bundle do not fit with the Palm I have. they are too small or don't work. Not sure why any items wouldn't be custom to the items I am needing it for.
2,WHAT WHAT WHAT?,"HAVE I GONE DELIRIOUS OR IT'S JUST THE LABLE COMPANY? WHATEVA HAPPENED TO HITS LIKE ""CARAVAN OF LIFE? WE KNOW THAT IT'S LOVE?... BUT THIS COMPILATION HAS SOME CLASSICS ON THOW. FOR 13.95 I THINK IT'S QUITE WORTH THE DEAL."
5,Wrapped in Plastic,To make sure this book was in great shape it was wrapped in plastic. It was shipped promtly and it was all I expected.
3,This book examines some of the minutia that makes or breaks a&c furniture,Not a coffee table book. A close look at a few of the details that enhance a&c furniture construction. Food for thought.
2,More stressful than fun. Not for little kids.,"The animation was beautiful as always and the story wasn't bad. However there was conflict between the characters and there was a lot of stress and a lot of scariness. If you have an older child who loves Scooby it might be fun for them as a ""scary movie."" Our 4 yo is not easily scared and he handled the movie fine but he didn't enjoy it and as parents we hated the disturbing images for him. Of course he wanted to keep watching and as he didn't seem traumatized we let him but paused the movie periodically to help ""pop"" him out of the movie's stressful world and make sure he was doing ok.Even if the movie isn't scary to the child, the point of Scooby Doo is that it's fun and silly and that kids love ""The Gang."" This movie is low on all of that substance so that is why the two stars. It just isn't fun for them."
1,Scooby Doo! How could you!,"I bought this DVD for my son who is 4 years old. He has been having the ""monsters in the closet"" problem lately. I figured that I could present him with the Scooby Doo I grew up with, which taught us that monsters & ghosts weren't real. They were just bad guys in masks. Much to my surprise, the new episodes are all about the supernatural. In the new episodes, monsters and ghosts do exist. The new episodes are also more frightening than the original episodes. I am sorely disappointed."
1,Real Monsters? Duh.,"By using ""real"" monsters, this movie completely misunderstands the legacy of Scooby Doo that made it such a classic. It is a sad but unsurprising commentary on the anti-rational times we live in that so many reviewers here applauded that decision. Mulder beats Sculley every time--it's so much easier not to look for real answers to unexplained phenomena. My three-year-old loves Scooby Doo but won't be watching this farce."
5,Awesome movie! My son loved it....,"The gang was great and as was the story line. My 3 year old enjoyed it as much as I did as he is in the ""RAARRRR"" stages and he loves this. It surprised me when I found out that they were real monsters and was wary about my son watching it, but it being a cartoon and all, i am sure it won't have any long term effects on him. He wasn't scared in the least. He was ""Wow, Monster! RARRR!""I cannot believe some of the ratings some people gave this. I can understand where they are coming from, but come on, this is just a cartoon. Let the kids know that this is not real and that it is a little scary, if they scare easily. Also if you are uncomfortable to show it to them at night, do it during the day. Otherwise do not buy it and read the reviews on it."
5,Great Movie!,"I've always adored "" Scooby Doo"" since i was 8 and this movie was a excellent comeback for him, i saw this on Cartoon Network and thought it was great.It's the story of Scooby, Shaggy and friends who take a vacation in a southern made Island to investagate a strange going on, now they discovered that the Island is cursed by dark forces including the undead, will they make it out alive or end up as bait for the darkness?Very entertaining and thrilling Scooby flick inspired by the old 40's voodoo flicks and Lucio Fulci Italian horror flicks, this is a must see for fans of Scooby or Zombie lovers.Similar movies recommended: Lucio Fulci's Zombie, City of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Cat People, An American Werewolf in London, Day of the Dead, Lucio Fulci's The Beyond, Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, Return of the Living Dead, Let Sleeping Corpses Lie and Creepshow."
5,Wonderful,My four year old and I watch it every Saturday and Sunday. I absolutely love it (so does he).It's the Scooby Gang -- a little older but with the same good intentions.The music is the best part for me.Very well put together for something that was a take off from the original.
3,"Too scary for my two year old, but entertaining for me","They deal with real monsters for a change and Scooby spends too much time eating instead of scooping around. The monsters were too real for my young one. I enjoyed the movie, but will hide it from my child for at least two years."
1,Was not what was delivered to me,"I ordered Scooby Doo on Zombie Island, my favorite movie from when I was a child, I was so excited to receive it in the mail but when I got it and opened the package the movie was not any kind of Scooby Doo movie, instead it was Wyatt Earp. Completely different to what I ordered. I have yet to return this item, but I was disappointed in the product because I bought from Movie Mars due to all of the good reviews that I read about them. I guess be careful of what you order. Could have been an honest mistake."
4,Fun,Had fun and found it true to what a Scooby-Doo mystery should be. All the family enjoyed watching this movie.
3,"Good movie, not for little children","I watched Scooby as a kid and my daugther, who is 4, loves the gang now. So I purchased this movie and thought it would be great for a Friday evening. This is not like any other Scooby movie, the monsters are real and there is considerable violence (deaths that occur on screen or are implied). It had several very scary parts that are typical in horror movies. On the other hand, usually I am bored by my daughter's TV shows, the plot was engaging and I was even a little frightened, I give it 3 stars but it should be 1 star as a young child's movie, and 4 to 5 star for a pre-teen and adult."
2,Disappointing Movie,"I loved Scooby Doo as a youngster and still enjoy watching it sometimes with the kids, but was really disappointed with this movie I bought them. It starts out good, but the ending is poor. In fact my younger one (3yrs) who watches the old scooby doo's is afraid of it. Even my older two (10 & 7 yrs) don't care the way they talked about cat gods and killing of people in a swamp. I would recommend you consider a different Scooby Doo movie for the youngsters."
4,My daughter loves it...,Like most Scooby movies my daughter was glued to this one. I myself didn't pay that much attention to it but if my daughter was able to sit still as long as she did then I know it's a good one for the little ones. My daughter has many movies & Scooby is one of the only ones that will hold her attention for very long. Recommended for the little ones for sure.
5,The Best of Scooby Doo,the gang is back and now they are fighting real monsters. It has a freaky ending and is a very speical moment in the gang's life.
1,*** a note to parents:this isn't one for young children!!!!!!!!!!!*******,"my boys and i are big fans of scooby-doo and have many of the movies and shows,and this is one that we had to turn off and then we had a sleepless night as it scared them so bad!!!now in all fairness older kids and adults may like it but this one has monsters that are REAL,ONE MORE TIME THE MONSTERS ARE REAL!!! that wouldn't be so bad,but the art is very real looking also and the tone is very grimin this one so before you buy,rent this and watch before you let your kids see this one!!! this is the only time i have not done so and it will be the last time i don't watch one before the kids do!!!!ONE MORE TIME: PLEASE WATCH THIS BEFORE YOU SHOW IT TO SMALLER KIDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Probably the worst Scooby Doo ever,"As a decades-long Scooby watcher, I was surprised that I just hated this one. I don't keep up with who writes or directs these various episodes and movies, but this one seemed completely out of the same league as all the others. None of that great subtle humor that I am used to in the others, and downright too scary for little kids, not to mention just plain stupid. But, if you are tired of the other Scoobs and want one where the danger actually turns out real, then this might be for you."
1,Please make it PG-13,This is definitely Scary. For young children this movie is way too scary and my kids don't freak to easily.I can see how others like it. But becareful how you intriduce it to your child.
1,Scooby Doo on Zombie Island : Not for kids,"Great, now they've ruined another great show. The point in the classics was to find out who the fake monsters were. If your raising your kids with Jewish or Christian values don't get this one. Lots of occultic stuff here."
1,There should be a zero star option!,"This was the WORST!!! Come on, REAL ZOMBIES!?! YUCK! I never would have let my children watch this BUT we were at a birthday party and I couldn't turn it off. This is NOT for young children!!!"
4,thought it was fun....not so different from original,Although I did notice that Thelma seemed to of lost weight and Daphne seems more educated and liberated...Shaggy and Scooby haven't changed a bit....Fred even seemed a bit more manly....according to my daughter Katelyn. My Son Alex loves the music....
5,Best Scooby Do Of All,Excellent story and animation. This is the best of the Scooby Do cartoons. I purchased the video and I have watched it many times. I enjoy it as much as the kids do.
2,"Not quite the same ole Scooby Doo, and very scary!","My 2+ year old daughter LOVES Scooby Doo (as do I; we have enjoyed several of the ""Classics"" also purchased from Amazon). However, we BOTH found *this* Scooby to be very scary ... PLUS the voices of most characters are *new*.. Shaggy just isn't the same without Casey Kasem at the helm. I say stick to the old Classics."
2,Way too scary for younger kids,"This Scooby Doo video is much too scary for kids under 10 or so: the zombies are truly frightening, a la Night of the Living Dead, and both they and the cat monsters in the story turn out to be _real_ -- very different from most Scooby Doo stories where the monster turns out to be a regular human in disguise. There's a scene where Fred tries to pull a zombie's ""mask"" off and ends up pulling off the creature's head -- in a kids' video?? What were the video makers thinking?!We made the mistake of letting our 6-year-old Scooby Doo fan watch this without screening it ourselves first (we figured ""It's Scooby Doo, it'll be fine"") and we were very sorry -- it gave him nightmares. So we advise other parents of young children -- see this one yourself before you decide whether your kids can watch it; it's not the Scooby Doo you remember from your own childhood."
3,Warning: Parents Beware!,"This is NOT for kids! One of the great things about Scooby Doo is that it shows kids that the ghosts and goblins are just crooks in masks. Zombie Island is a HUGE disappointment. I was lucky to see this before my 6 year old did (and now he won't). It is great for adults, however. It has all of the usual mystery and classic animation you expect but the ending is not typical. There should have been a warning on the package. I will be more careful in the future."
2,Parents... be warned!,"If you are a parent of a child under five, or a parent seeking to avoid disturbing content and images for your older children... this is not the Scooby Doo you saw as kids! Certainly, it's animated, but animated can absolutely be intense and scary. As a kid, I felt a sense of relief (everything was right with the world again) when the ""monsters"" were unmasked. They were just ""bad guys"" after all, usually out for some monetary gain. In this updated version, the monsters are ""real"", some intent on draining the blood from innocent victims as part of a ritualistic sacrifice. At the end, the spirits of very scary zombies are ""released,"" no longer forced to roam the island. Not what I had in mind for my child's entertainment. I turned off the movie three-fourths of the way through, and regret not having done so earlier. Stick with the classic version... why anyone would knowingly present their child with such storylines and images is beyond me."
1,Not for small children!!!,"Unlike the original classic Scooby Doo, this video/movie has no place in a young child's view. My 4 year old is still having nightmares from it -- my own fault, I trusted Scooby Doo to have remained family friendly, and it wasn't. The scenes of people turning into zombies, cat creatures, and werewolves are too much for a young child's imagination. In this story, the ghosts are *real* and when the masks don't come off at the end, there is no happy resolution that lets a 4 year old sleep well at night. Disappointing to have to pre-screen SD from now on."
3,Monsters are real,"This one could be scary for kids 6 and under. The monsters (ghosts, zombies, demons) turn out to be real (Daphne wishes early on that she wants to catch a real ghost for once, instead of someone in a costume), so... The story isn't half bad (young kids won't follow the lore), and there is a lot of action. Overall, my son (age 4) thinks this one is great because of all the ""really scary ghosts."" I'd recommend it for Scooby fans who don't scare easily and want the thrill of a real monster."
2,Far Fetched,"Just like in the 70s and 80s, the producers of Scooby Doo made a movie completely out of Mystery Inc.'s catagory. Though called the most realistic of the fictional Scooby movies, it doesn't make up for the poor voice and mediocre animation. The highlight of this film is the music, though. The soundtrack combines rock and classic scores together. Another good thing is the interesting twist at the end of the movie. But sadly, the good things of this movie cannot help this poor quality film enough to make it good."
2,Where's the mask?,"This movie is not at all what I was expecting from Scooby Doo. My son and I love Scooby and watch everything from the television shows to all of his movies. This one is different because the zombies and cat monsters are real--no masks with bad guys under them! Great, that's all I need. I have a hard enough time convincing my son that monsters aren't real. In the other Scooby Doo shows, this is reinforced, but not in this one. I was disappointed that the box didn't have a warning to keep me from buying such a horrible show. I would NOT recommend."
1,ALERT!!!!!!!! this isn't for young children!!!!,this is not a movie for kids! it has real monsters (i know the box tells you that but the art of the film is very grapic and the story is very much ment for adults) so be sure you watch this movie before you show it to kids.now as for the movie it's self it really isn't very good and isn't part of the scooby-doo series as far as i see it!!! just plain not good!!!!!!!!
3,Okay movie for adults - not appropriate for children.,"Decent plotline for adults, but once again the Scooby Fanchise has created an adult-themed movie and marketed towards children. Too scary for my children. I started screening the Scooby Doo movies after the ""Scooby Doo and the Witch's Ghost"" debacle and this one is another that won't make it to family movie night."
3,A little scarier than the others - not as good for little kids,This is another Scooby Doo movie in the new more modern animation style. It's a good movie but it's a little too scary for little kids. My kids favorites are Loch Ness Monster and the Mummy one.
5,Wow.,"I saw ""Zombie Island"" on cartoon network and wowthat has to be the best Scooby doo movie i'v ever seenit was scary so i recomond it for kids 6 and up"
1,DO NOT ALLOW YOUNG CHILDREN TO WATCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have not seen this movie since I was four, but I had nightmares for months after watching it. Also TO THIS DAY I cannot see the cover of the box without shuddering and remembering how freaked out I was by it. I would not allow any child under the age of 7-8 to watch this movie."
1,Not for young children........alligators eat innocent people.........,"in a flashback sequence. The cat people are truly frightening, and I will NOT let my children see this one. They were disappointed when we had to stop the DVD. I'm glad I didn't waste any money buying it. I can see it being thrilling for tweens and up - it's a low-key horror movie for that age - but it's not the Scooby Doo that I remember and want my children to enjoy."
2,"Useful, but disappointing","The back cover of this book states correctly, ""Compared to preaching, books on teaching appear only rarely. Good ones, designed especially for those who teach the Bible to adults, can scarcely be found.""Given the pedigree of the authors, I had high expectations when I purchased this book. I especially thought that I had found a book that approached education from a *distinctively* Christian perspective. I was disappointed.The first chapter or so was more like what I expected, discribing the need for effective Bible teaching. But the rest of the book contains what are basically the same perspectives and techniques as any other book on education. It was not *distinctively* Christian pedagogically speaking, but rather the same old educational theory applied to teaching the Bible.Perhaps my expectations for this book were too high. Perhaps the book I'm looking for is not yet written. Any suggestions would be welcomed."
3,Alright but needs to be updated,"The book has a great summary of the movement since the stonewall incident, unfortunately I purchased it to donate to a school library and its out of date. They need to update the material to include what has happened in this century. The marrige battle in Hawaii and Alaska are missing, as well as the victories in Vermont, Massachusets, and California. It's well written, just out of date."
3,A basic introduction,"This book, aimed at a younger audience, contains a dense body of information about the beginnings of the Gay Rights movement, from 1969 to 2000. It's highly informative, if a bit dry. It's also extremely neutral in its treatment of both pro-gay and anti-gay politics and beliefs, although the book overall is more gay friendly than anything. A good, basic introduction."
5,Buy This One,This book is a must have if you are interested in reading a true account of life in the Coast Guard.
1,Not a Coast Guard story!,This is NOT a Coast Guard Story! It is an ignorant thugs story - a jerk that relied on his fists and arrogance - not surprised he was deep sixed!
5,fantastic,"Of various genres, this has got to be the best CD I have ever purchased. The lyrics are beautiful and the harmonies are fantastic."
5,I fell in love with this album,"I've been to Mexico several times but only this time I found out about Sin Bandera. Especially the song ""Entra en mi vida"" didn't get out of my mind so that I bought this Album afterwards through amazon.com, Now I'm able to enchant all my friends with an astonishing album of 12 great songs and each time I listen to this music I like it even more."
4,Another satisfying book about Chung Kuo,"David Wingrove's series continues to keep me coming back for more. The characters are well developed, the intrigues are captivating and the possibilities are scary... Can't wait until the next volume arrives at my door."
1,"garbage, filthy, broken","I ordered a gently used book in like new condition. What I got was a filthy de-commissioned library book with a binding so broken the book was in pieces. The seller asked me to seal the package back up and send it back as rejected, which got me a lovely lecture at the post office about the miss-use of the USPS. I ended up paying to return the book. I'm not sure I will ever buy another used book through Amazon. So Sad."
3,"Hello, who's this?","This is a fairly typical Wesley Willis CD. Most of the songs were written during a personal appearance he made in Iowa. There are several songs about people he met during the trip. There are also several songs about concerts he attended, and several songs about licking the private parts of animals. It's not really one of his best CDs. His voice is often distorted, and the backing tracks are more boring than usual. But Wesley's fans will still probably enjoy it."
5,Excelente!,"This is not a complete set by any means but as the title says, it is essential in order to grasp the enduring career of Tito Puente if you are not familiar with his music or are just starting out. Its two discs cover a career by giving a sampling of his work from all periods, and of course featuring the popular favorites which may have drawn people to start to listen in the first place. I highly recommend this set for the individual who has no Tito Puente but would like a small collection of some of his best works. The sound quality is great and the songs are superb. Just TRY not to dance when you play these discs!"
4,Framed Art Poster,The framed art has good quality however I would have preferred glass instead of plexi glass. They did not provide this option when the order was placed.
4,Educational,"Lacey has a flowing style that is easy to read. Her take on things, in my opinioin is spot on."
4,Excellent Historical Study of The Boston Harbor Islands,"Most Bostonians can view several of the harbor islands as they look eastward. However, to visit the islands requires a pass on one of the water shuttles that leave daily from Long Wharf. Anyone visiting these island must find a copy of this book. (Now out of Print). An easy, short read on the 300 yrs of legends and facts built on these islands."
2,Icky Sticky Tablets,These L-Carnitine tabs get sticky and the supplements will corrode with moisture when put into a multi-day pill pack. For me this was a no-go because I have to take these three times a day and use a pack. Look for capsule form to avoid this. Other then that they do the job just not as flexible.
2,Tablets not the same as capsules,"This is the first time I have used L-carnitine in tablet form. I discovered they really absorb water from the air. I travel a lot and put my vitamins in a daily pill caddy. After a few days these Swanson L-carnitine tablets got sticky while other vitamins are fine. They should have warned people about this, cheaper yes, but unless you plan to always keep them tightly sealed in the jar they were shipped in, do not order this form. I would hesitate to order from Swanson again after this."
1,Too big,These tablets are too big to swallow for me. They are much larger than a 500mg pill should be.
2,"""She's a squirter!"" - Male 24 CO, USA",This is the best shave gel I've ever tried. Why put it in an aerosol can?????! Take out the isopentane and the isobutane and put in a tube!!! It would be the exact same thing.This shave gel works to an excellent lather. I use a DE razor and brush. It works better than any other creams or gels I have tried. The only one I haven't tried yet is Taylor of Old Bond Street which is currently on the way. A tiny bit goes a long way which is why the overpressurized can infuriates people including myself. I say you don't need the can period! Break from the norm...or should I say go back to the traditional ways! Less is better sometimes!Update:11/15/11This shave cream while it does provide a nice shave leaves my cheeks burning red! I don't know what ingredient it is but something doesn't work well with it...
1,not for allergy patients,"all ingredients are not listed on amazon. i had to return it because of some allergy type ingredients, such as paraben, a known carcinogen."
5,Great shave gel,I suffer from sensitive skin so I needed a shaving product that could handle my sensitivity. Aveeno is the best over the counter product I used thus far for my face without really irritating it.
5,Best Shaving Cream,This is the best shaving cream I've ever used and it'svery hard to locate in my area. I would suggest to anybodyto try it !!!
4,Helps stop ingrown hairs and razor cuts...,"Aveeno shave gel is a great product to stop ingrown hairs and limit cuts created by shaving. I suggest this product for men because it helped stop a lot of the skin problems that shaving caused. It also helps limit the skin problems created by using multiblade razors, such as the Mach III and Schick Quattro.The smell is faint, but it isn't the greatest and the product is expensive. You can try Aveeno's better smelling alternative shave cream called Positively Smooth. Also, other companies are creating similar formula gels that are *much* cheaper. Try the one by Edge and you will see a *large* similarity."
1,I should've listened,"I should've listened to a previous reviewer who said the gel squirts out really fast and hard. I thought I was smart enough to handle this cheap and highly rated product. Unfortunately after a few days of using it in the shower, it ricocheted off my hand and squirted directly into my eye. It felt like a bee stung my eye and I was screaming and in pain for about at least one hour. I don't know who the idiot was that designed this product but they need to be FIRED! Obviously he or she never used this product on a daily basis.Note: I bought this item thru Amazon from a company called ""Best closeouts"" it's possible this could be a discontinued product and Aveeno has fixed this problem. If that's true then shame on ""Best closeouts"" for selling me a known problem."
1,"Great gel, terrible dispenser","I've been using this gel for five years. Fantastic gel, the best out there. Recently, Aveeno has started messing with the aerosol dispenser. First batch I got, the pressure was so low I had to turn the can upside down to get anything out. Next can, the pressure was so high it exploded all over the bathroom. I can't believe that any company could put such poorly tested garbage in customer's hands. I bet some VP at J&J decided this would be a great way to increase profit. I hope Aveeno get their act together and go back to selling a good product again."
5,Wondeful Gel!,"Love this gel, it feels great on my face, takes care of my skin and I get a great shave!"
4,"When I use a gel, this is the one","I prefer shaving with a tube cream, but I keep some gel on hand. Aveeno is the only gel I will use, and have used, for years. It was touch-and-go there for a while when Aveeno re-worked the can, and I was overjoyed to see it back on the shelves. The gel is very soothing on my skin, and it gives me a great shave. I understand the frustration of those who find this version to have too much pressure. Frankly, though, I never noticed."
1,Defective Design!,"I didn't really feel to need to write a review until I used this product a couple of times and I don't have many positive things to say about it.There are several things that I notice with Aveeno's shave gel:1. I just find that it is very annoying that the shave gel squirts out too quickly. Emphasis on TOO QUICKLY! If you aren't *extra careful, if will ricochet off your hands into the mirror or anywhere else in the bathroom. (Happened to me numerous times). Product will definitely run out in no time.2. It says ""no fragrance added"" but there is a very distinct smell that emanates and it smells bad in my opinion. Maybe some fragrance is needed.I was actually a bit surprised to find so many people pleased with this product, but to each their own. I think R&D; needs to go back and work on the squeeze mechanism."
5,the best,"I've been shaving my legs for too long! This is THE BEST product I have ever used. I think Aveeno recently discontinued it, and if that's true I'm so disappointed. If it shows up at discount stores, I'm stocking up."
2,Would be five stars IF...,"Love the PRODUCT. I know it was off the shelves for a while, due to problems with the pump. Saw it was available again, and started using it again, since the CVS version, while good, wasn't quite the same. The first two cans were fine, but this morning, I used a new can for the first time, went to put some gel on my hand, and was promptly blinded when the stuff went everywhere, including my eye. I could not see for about 5 minutes (pretty scary when you're all alone in the house, my husband is away on business), and the pain was horrible. Even now, a good three hours since it happened, my eye stings a little.Aveeno needs to take this product off the shelves again, and keep it off the shelves unless and until this problem is resolved.It shouldn't be all that difficult - the CVS store brand doesn't seem to have this issue!!"
2,"great product, bad bottle","i love this stuff, but it is under too much pressure so it shoots out in a high power streams that gets everywhere."
3,Not quite what I expected.,"I placed an order for a book which was just labeled as Mush. I was expecting Mush, a Dog from Space and got this book instead. Mush's Jazz Adventure, while entertaining, is not quite as funny as Mush, a Dog from Space. Also, the publisher printed the illustrations nearly all the way to the edges of the paper and the text almost as far out. While I am all for conserving resources, the tight binding makes it a bit difficult to see everything that is on the page.There is nothing wrong with the writing here, and Jill Pinkwater's illustrations are inviting as well. The book just wasn't what I expected it to be when I placed my order."
3,Not what I expected. . .,"I thought when I ordered this book that I would be getting Mush, a Dog from Space (I believe that, then, the title just appeared as ""Mush""). What I actually got was Mush's Jazz Adventure. Mush's Jazz Adventure, while entertaining, is not quite as funny as Mush, a Dog from Space.

3,"Very Cool, but...","Bought it for my 7 year old son. I think the age recommendation is 12 and over. It's a bit intimidating for the smaller kids. I can't keep the neighbors away from it. My kid hardly gets to ride it. The downside is the battery. It doesn't last very long. The more times you charge it, the shorter it lasts. I tried finding a new battery on line. Good Luck! They're all gone. That kinda tells you something, huh? For the person asking what the ""24"" meant. I think it means 24 volts, which is what the scooter runs on."
3,Razor e300 Electric Scooter,"We bought two Razor e300 scooters for the two older grandchildren for their birthdays in Aug 2011. They were OK at the time. When the third grandchild's birthday came up about 3 months later, we did better research and bought him an eZip 450 by Currie. I would rank the eZip as 100% better than the Razor. Much better design, more rugged, more reliable, better battery run time, battery condition indicator on handlebars. I would never buy a Razor again unless it was less than half the price of the eZip."
1,SHIPS IN ORIGINAL PACKAGE,Buyer beware!!! This ships in it's original package. Christmas came a month early in our house.
5,Great Scooter,I bought this for my 12 year old daughter. She loves it. I thought the price was great. I would recommend this scooter.
5,My Son LOVES It!,"I was a little worried about the power and battery life after reading some of the poor reviews; however, I purchased the scooter because there were so many good reviews. I gave it to my son for his birthday (he really wanted a Sony PSP), and he loves the scooter. We have moderate size hills in our area, and the scooter has no problem climbing them at a fair pace. The battery lasted longer than I expected. It's a quality built scooter--very sturdy. It is easy to assemble and they provide the tools to assemble. The only thing is that the rear-wheel tire inflator extender is difficult to find. You have to pry the end of the right (throttle side) hand grip.It has met my expectations, and when I asked my son if he wanted me to return the scooter and purchase a PSP, he smiled and said: ""I didn't know about the scooter; I want the scooter!"" NOW, I'll probably have to purchase another scooter for my daughter."
3,fun but doesn't last long,"I purchased this item for my 12 year old for Christmas. It was a lot of fun. Easy to put together (he did it himself). However, it only lasted until the end of July. It would sometimes charge...sometimes not. It didn't act like a short, however he was caught several times having to drag it home. We contaced Amazon and they replaced it, but said they would only do so this once. I hope the new one last a bit longer. For the price they should last for a few years at least!"
2,Chain tensioner broke in after 1 month of light use,"For the first month the e300 was great, then one day it stopped moving and starting making a grinding noise. I took it apart and found the chain tensioner was broken. When I went online to try to order a new one I found that everywhere I looked was sold out of that specific part - while every other part was readily available. Obviously Razor has a defective part that needs a redesign."
2,"fun, while it lasted","broke down, wasnt really powerful, spend your money on something else, it cant really get up hills, and goes not that fast"
5,Awesome Scooter,"I absolutely love this scooter. It really rides fast. It is super sturdy. It isn't one of those little flimsy scooters. The deck is huge compared to most other brands. My five year old has the same brand just a smaller model. I put training wheels on it so he won't tip over and we ride all over the place. It rides for about an hour before you need to charge it, sometimes a little less, sometimes a little more."
2,Run Time and Customer Service,"After following ALL instructions accompanying the product we still experienced run times of two thirds less than reflected in accompanying literature. Attempts to contact Razor via email was about as frustrating as I've seen anywhere. The scooter is well constructed but battery life is very problematic. This may be a ""fluke"" with this particular battery but the customer service response is ""weak"" and pretty much leaves you hanging refering you to automated problem resolution suggestions that are basically the same as those that appear in the accompanying literature. I will attempt further contact with Razor via the web and phone."
2,dead battery,"The scooter is great fun but the battery dies withing minutes, it was advertised as lasting for at least 45 minutes."
4,Fun,"We bought it in May 2006 and have used it almost daily since then. The scooter is fun and easy to ride. The only negatives are that the circuit breaker will trip while climbing steep hills (of course, that's what a breaker is for), and the batteries will no longer hold a charge. I expected the batteries to last longer than 6 months."
4,Well built scooter,We bought this for our 8 year old son. It was a big hit and has held up to the last months beating. The battery starts off strong and holds its charge for a reasonable amount of time. The instructions claim 40 minutes on a full charge. It seems pretty accurate. I definitely think that getting the 300 gives you the best battery/power combination. The box says ages 12 and up but I think it is perfect for our 8 year old. Not too powerful but enough power that it is not laboring to get going while he rides it. I weigh 190 pounds and this scooter does a good job of pulling me around. I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a motorized scooter. Good quality...
2,Warranty?,"Product was fine for about a month. Perfect operation and perfect charging conditions were present. Then one day it's power was so weak I thought it didn't charge properly. After trying different chargers and outlets, we determined it's internal. Now I'm definitely concerned about my refund or warranty since the box is long gone."
3,Scooter doesn't scoot too long,"The kids LOVE their scoooters but being kids, they want to go full throttle. I don't have to worry about them staying on them all day because you can only ride them 30-45 minutes before the need a THREE hour recharge!"
4,Scooter = Happiness,"My husband and I purchased this scooter for our grandson's 8th birthday. After he had opened his many presents, we wheeled the scooter into his view. He got big tears in his eyes and said he was so happy he wanted to cry!!"
4,Razor E300 Electric Scooter was just as expected - very good!,"The Razor scooter was a Christmas present that was extremely easy to put together, it was very well packed and shipping was immediate and problem free. The scooter performed as expected, so my daughter is having lots of fun. The whole process of finding, ordering, shipping was all very easy and fast! An overall pleasant shopping experience."
2,ok : /,"Scooter is fun but has tons of problems so doesn't work more then half the time. i have had to but 2 pairs of batteries, and two rear tires both of which are not very cheap. And,, requires a lot of maintenence . The chain pops a lot. If you really want it, be prepared to put work and money into it. Only suggest it for younger kids with a parent that knows mechanics!"
4,Great Scooter for the money...,I bought this for myself - I'm an average size guy and weigh about 210 lbs. Where I work I have to park about a half mile from my office. So I ride the scooter on days that the weather is decent. It is runnig great and pulling my large manly body along just fine. I'm sure it would do great for teenagers just looking to have some fun. I have noticed that you really have to watch vehicles because they will make left turns while your getting ready to cross in the cross walk or even some will pull right into the cross walk. A couple of times I just about crashed into a car not expecting them to continue into the cross walk. They just don't see you as they do a pedestrian. Happy trails....
1,Razor E Electric Scooter Review,"I bought two of the these for my kids. I followed all battery charging instructions, but both of them are unable to be recharged after less than six months with minimal riding time. I called the customer support at Razor, they are aware of the problem but are not in the business of giving away free batteries after the 90 day warranty period. Now I know why it's only 90 days. I'm sure they make more off of battery sales than scooters. It's a fun toy when it works, but be prepared to spend an additional fifty dollars or more per year on replacment batteries."
4,"good scooter, needs some maintenance","Don't get me wrong, the scooter is awesome. The only problem was that the battery needed to be replaced as soon as the scooter came because it had gotten damaged during delivery. Razor sent a replacement battery for free, guess what, we had to re-wire it ourselves!!! It was hard work, but we got the job done. To this day the scooter works fine, i just wish razor had been a bit more of assistance. I rate this 4 stars"
2,Razor 300,"We are having problems with the scooter, and we cannot even take it back. We have to repair it ourselves. We only had it for 60 days. Razor sent us the parts, because it was still under warrenty but we have to try to repair it. It still is not repaired."
1,Bad Design,"This is a nice scooter, unfortunately it has a design flaw. If you get a flat rear tire (remember kids are riding this thing) the tube cannot be repaired because you cannot remove the tire from the rim. I would not recommend this scooter, until they repair the flaw and provide same for existing owners. My opinion is DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
1,don't buy this,"This never worked and Razor was very unhelpful, in fact refused to do anything about it. Steer clear! Waste of money!"
1,Very unhappy.,I am actually sending this item back for a refund. It does not stay charged longer than 5 minutes max. For the money I paid I am very unhappy.
3,ok scooter,"For a first time scooter, it's great. My advice is try to take special, special care of it. My on/off switch broke because I think I turned it off and on too much. So here's a good tip for buyers, don't do that because it wastes a lot of battery power. So, I'm sort of mad about my E-300 but hey, it was good before that happened!"
2,Inclines,"[...]. This unit may be a great purchase for neighborhoods with flat terrain, but we have an incline not a HILL, just an incline and the unit would shut off automatically. Then we would have to hit the reset button to turn the unit back on. I know the unit has the reset button for a very good reason but this unit does not provide enough power for terrain with inclines. We purchased another unit and it is working wonderful. We have not tested it on a hill yet, but it definitely works on our inclines.Thank you"
4,300 razor,This was a gift for my grandsons. I am told they really like it and ride it all the time. It was easy to put together and use.
4,great fun,I bought this for my 9 yo. He loves it. The tires are big enough to ride on grass and the scooter is fast enough to keep the older kids happy.
2,Fun has'nt started yet....,"I got the e300 yesterday and am all excited about it. I have two issues, though:1) The item was rusted ! The place on the base where you insert the handle was rusted. Not sure if there is any saftey issue with this.2) The valve extender to inflate the rear tire is missing. I opened the right side handle sleeve and peeked in but couldnt find any.I cant inflate and the equipment cant be used till that time.I have emailed the seller and waiting for response. I will be updating this review (and rating) on what happens next - amazon's response, seller's response, my overall customer experience and, of course, the product itself - when I can get to ride it."
1,You get what you pay for !,"I bought 2 of these for my kids, 7 & 10 Y/O... The packages arrived all torn up and missing cardboard in many areas, those areas had been package taped to keep in the product. Both scooters were scratched due to the missing protective cardboard... I saved around $40 each... NOT WORTH IT... These are advertised as ""NEW"". They may have never been purchased but they are certainly not new! Poor Christmas presents at that rate.Also note, Chain is shipped to tight, loosen the chain for best performance. I am around 185lbs and these scooters pulled me around on a flat surface and a full battery. Battery life is terrible, around 30 mins for my 7 Y/O that weighs approx 50lbs wet.Many people have thought this would be too fast for a 7y/o... by far it was not! Overall I would say KEEP LOOKING!"
1,Electric Scooter,"This is the second Razor electric product I have bought. The fist was the go cart, it is never used due to faulty batteries. The electric scooter was in use two days, and the ball bearings fell out of the wheels.So it hasn't been used for quite some time."
3,Razor E300,"The Scooter is great on hard pack or pavement, it doesn't get along well on hills and gravel. The hills deaden the battery very fast! Our driveway has a small incline, and after about 2 trips up the driveway, the battery becomes weak."
2,Won't keep a charge!,"My 11 year old son bought this a couple of weeks ago on Amazon and it ran well for the first day. Since then, we haven't been able to get it to work. We were on the phone with tech support and they said it was the battery charger, so they sent us a new charger which we had to wait over a week for and it STILL doesn't work. We called again and now they want us to charge it with the power on. It still doesn't work... They said they will send a new battery, but we'll have to wait again over a week. Very disappointing purchase! My son has been saving for a while to get this and he can't even ride it!"
4,If you enjoy chant...,You will love this. More for meditation or relaxation. This is not the CD for your holiday party bur it is nice for quiet moments.
5,One of the best war novels written,"The first time I read this book it was for a school assignment. Now I must have read it about a hundred times. It is an anti-war novel. Always in school, at least in American, we are always taught that the Germans are the ""bad guys"" and they are the ones to blame. However, this book is from a German soldier's point of view. The more I read the more I began to sympathize and the more I realized that they were in the exact same boat as our doughboys. It touches on points based on politics and humanities. This book does have a lot of action in it and it is not for the squirmish. The illustrated edition is particularly interesting because of the photographs of the soldiers. (It really got me in the mood.) Thank you for reading my review. :-)"
5,Best book I've ever read,"I read this when I was 15 in sophomore english class... I then bought the book myself and read it at least once or twice a year. The message is heart breaking, true, and clear. The style of writing is beautiful. This was the only book I actually read in my sophomore class... for the rest I just skimmed. I was planning on skimming, but The first chapter caught my eye. Definitely worth the price, such a beautiful book."
1,Belt Clip fails,"Good: The metal protection is nice and the Palm is a snug fit.Bad: The screw attaching the belt clip to the Palm case fell out within 1 hour of using the product, and the palm fell to the floor. This product is horrible if you plan to clip it to your belt and expect it to stay attached."
5,Great movie!!!,"I saw this on TV a couple months ago and really liked it!! One night I was looking for movies under $5 and came across this and went ahead and ordered it!!! It's amazing and recommended it for anyone that likes action,crime,drama movies and Vin Diesel is a BEAST in the role he plays!! No one else could play that role!!! :) Oh and it looks really good on my Blu - Ray Player even through it's not a Blu - Ray it still looks amazing!! :)"
5,A Man Apart,This movie is by far the best that Vin has ever been in. His character makes you agree with his way of thinking. Great movie.
1,Egads,"Wow...this is just tripe. I love the wannabe hefty drama/emotional movie title ""A Man Apart"". This is just another gang bangin' shoot 'em up.I thought Pitch Black was very good, and I liked the Riddick character. But as soon as I saw the previews for Fast & the Furious, XXX and A Man Apart I knew Vin had fallen into the once promising actor pit. This movie just sucks.Oh yeah, to the guy who wants Vin to admit he's black, guess what? Vin has stated several times that he's of mixed background, it's easy to see(how many african americans have german names?). Get off of it already."
2,disappointment!,"I liked Vin Diesel despite Riddick and thought that he can be a good action star. Unfortunately, this movie at the very least didn't demonstrate his acting abilities (unless you consider looking tough as an acting skill). Grunted, the movie doesn't help. It is badly written, badly directed. Overall, mediocre B-movie."
2,Yet another weak action flick,"I went into this one thinking it was gonna be good. What was I thinking?! The previews made the movie out to be an interesting action/drama, and it looked as though Vin Diesal was going to show some range in his acting. Well, I went to it, and I was wrong! It's just another cliche riddled action flick, with too many shoot em up scenes and abosolutly NO character development whatsoever. I have to admit, Vin Diesal did try in this one. There are scenes in this movie where he is really believable. It's just the old revenge plot that we have seen over and over again, in dozens and dozens of cop movies. Every action movie that is released these days lacks any originality whatsoever.Diesal basically plays a man who is trying to find his wife's killer and bring him down. He has to turn in his badge after he goes nuts on the wrong guy, and he takes matters into his own hands. Thats it. I lost interest in it about half way through.SKIP IT, or wait for the video atleast."
2,Another Vin Diseal Bomb,"This movie steals so liberally from so many movies It felt Like I'd already seen it a dozen times. Although it's a bit better than the rest of the dreck (phone booth!?, Basic!?) that's out right now, I'd skip it unless you think Vin's a real hottie."
1,Very Sad,"I am a huge Vin Deisel fan I own all of his movies, but this one will not be joining my collection. It is a movie that has the best parts in the middle of the movie and kinda drags after that. The plot is kinda incoherrent and jumpy. This is one to rent not buy."
1,Incredibly lame,"Director F. Gary Gray (The Italian Job) is at the helm of this ludicrous mess which features overmuscled wanna be action hero Vin Diesel as a DEA Agent out for revenge. A Man Apart is pretty much a vehicle for Diesel and nothing more, it is allegedly supposed to demonstrate Diesel's acting range by trying to feature a large emotional scope, but the whole thing is a mess. Everything just seems so cliche and generic, action scenes and scenes where Diesel is trying to be ""emotional"" just have a ""I've seen this before, and I've seen this done better"" feel to it; and in the end, A Man Apart is pretty much another excuse for Diesel to flex his muscles and blow stuff up. I liked this guy better when he talked with an Austrian accent."
3,"Okay, let's be honest","I haven't seen this movie yet, but... doesn't it sound a little bit like a remake of ""Death Wish""...Hm... a ""Death Wish"" for the 2000s, and Insted of Charles Bronson, we get Vin Diesel. Can't be that bad."
4,Give It a Chance,"A Man Apart is one of those movies that I originally based my opinion from every other critic other than myself. The one thing that inspired me to watch this flick was nothing more than my fiance's complete obsession with Mr. Diesel. I hate to admit I was wrong. Yes, as usual Diesels deliveries are not on the mark but overall I found the pace of this one to be very satisfying. I appreciated the near realistic shootouts (but movieland please learn to re-load movie weapons at appropriate times), the need of revenge (yes, I like the woman I'm to marry) and the slow yet not boring pace to get to the end. Diesel does his best when either speaking monotone or not at all, and yes he will convince you he's hurt, mad and [angry]. A Man Apart is not a bad movie. Again, Diesel lacks a completly convincing role, but the movie is a good time."
4,A Man Coming Apart,"Better than I expected, based on the mixed reviews I've read. Vin & Larenz were good, I was surprised they made such a believable & natural pair! & the story did have a couple of surprises (for me). Watch Diesel's expressive face convey the way Vetter is often on the verge of exploding from pain & anger, Vin does this even when he's not the focus of the action.Vetter is a man overwhelmed by his wife's murder, & no one put him in check before he went completely haywire, even though they saw signs of trouble. I would like to have seen the guy referred for some therapy or at least have a real good cry, but that wouldn't make for much of an action movie.There were certainly holes in the story, & the 'happily married man phase' was a bit overdone. Diesel acted so smitten & the wife so sweet she had 'DEATH' written across her forehead! But it's all make believe anyway, and still worth seeing and listening to (good music). So Vin, where's the soundtrack?"
3,Vin call your agent,I love Vin Diesel but I wish I'd skipped this movie. The first bad sign was the fact that this thing has actually been in the can on the shelf for about a year before being released. This usually indicates that it's a problem movie. The second really bad thing involves the death of the wife. That scene was extremely ugly and should've been shortened. You're supposed to cheer Vin on as he goes on his quest for revenge but the film is just such a sloppy mess that you probably won't care what happens. Rent XXX and watch that again instead.
2,Where is Steven Segal?,"This movie was supposed to be the vehicle to show off the versatility of Vin Diesel's acting talents. It failed on that objective. Vin Diesel has proven that he is solely an action movie hero. If he attempts to stray from that formula, it will not be a convincing acting performance. The movie had entertaining portions to it, but overall I would say that the movie did not do it for me. When I see a movie I would like to feel something. I want to become attached to the characters and see them either struggle or succeed. This movie spent way to much time have shots of Vin Diesel staring into space for an action movie and too much action for a movie trying to tackle an emotional man's attempt to deal with his wife's death. This movie was the typical action movie star film and could have starred any of the sterotypical action movie stars."
2,Canadian Blu-Ray has incorrect aspect ratio...,"The Canadian blu-ray version of this film is presented open matte to fill a 16:9 television screen instead of the proper 2:35 to 1 scope ratio of the theatrical prints. This means you get more information at the top and bottom of the screen than originally intended. Your best bet is to seek out the Dutch all-region blu-ray that presents the film in the correct theatrical scope format.The film itself is a pretty standard cop flick, somewhat better than a cruddy cable-TV cop show, but not by much. Diesel should have searched longer for a better script, particularly if was going to have a mundane director like F. Gary Gray at the helm. The cop revenge bit has been done to death, and this one is weaker than usual. It's not up to what any number of other action stars have produced in the past."
3,In spite of a sloppy script.........,"Vin does a wonderful job acting. Even though he barely sheds a tear,he facial expressions alone convey the anguish he goes through after his wife's death.Larenz Tate and the rest of the supporting cast do a great job also.The real problem lies in the script;it was obviously written in haste and without any real clarity.Any actor who can work w/ such writing deserves plenty of credit.But those of you who walked away completely disappointed,PLEASE dont judge Vin Diesel's acting skills by this movie alone!"
4,"Great movie...with a nice, surprising twist!","I recommend this movie...it was very enjoyable...even aside from all the drooling I did just looking at Vin on the screen...that man just rocks my world! haha...but really....Great story, nice + unexpected twist. Enjoy!"
4,Great Movie a Must see,"This movie is great and a must see. Vin shows his true acting abilities and that he can be more than a tough guy that drives a car. Great movie I would recommend it to anyone who loves action, and it also has a great story about love intertwined with it."
2,overblown&drawn out,"alot of action&semi suspense going on but this film is in need of a good edting.this film seems like 4-5 films tied in as one&not any of the good stuff. I Respect F.Gary Gray but His Films on a whole outside of ""Friday"" have been long on Action but short on Substance to hold weight all the way through. this is another example of some good ideas that get burried quickly&a film that has some aight moments but is way overblown."
5,GREAT ACTION FLICK!,"I thoroughly enjoyed the story and action of the movie.I still can't understand why there is such use of the ""f"" word - it sounds so much like an adolescent rebellion and un-educated persons who don't know how to use english.And face it guys - bare bodies aren't all that exciting -- gee!Attitude, presence, chrisma is what comes across to make a great character. Vin Diesel comes across well as does his partner.Generally all around good action - gross language [in spots] great villians - great photography - well put together. Wouldn't change it, except............"
4,an impressive three piece band,"I saw pit er pat when they opened for tortoise in madison and i really enjoyed it. They consist of a female lead singer and keybordist, a bassist, and a drummer. their powerfully bouncy drum beats, poppy keyboard melodies, and droning bjork-esque vocals were enough to keep me interested and wanting more once their set was over. This band definitely has potential but it felt like something was missing (probably the lack of guitar, although it was refreshing to see a band that didnt focus solely on guitar). anywho, check out the song ""too many"", the song seems to represent the band better than any other."
5,"just like the title says, it's a greatest hits album",this is a nice recording to have if you want his major hits. It includes all the ones that he's best known for. A great basic album to have if you're a Chayanne fan.
2,Tin Pan Alley Blues Collection,"Where did they get this title? I don't think it is representing the ""Tin Pan Alley"" genre, very well anyway. If you want to hear a better sampling, listen to Albert King or Stevie Ray Vaughn's version of ""Tin Pan Alley"" (Couldn't Stand the Weather #7). I grew up around the blues in Memphis, Tn., and I'm tolerant of many personal styles. The 4 samples I listened to didn't do much for me. You be the judge! Thanx,"
2,Includes Eso Beso (That Kiss!),"Anka has a nice voice but he hasn't recorded anything good for over 45 years. (He also has the distinction of writing lyrics for two of the most abominably wretched songs ever recorded: (You're) Having My Baby and My Way.) His RCA re-recordings of earlier ABC-Paramount hits like Diana and Put Your Head On My shoulder are also not as good as the originals. I got this CD for Eso Beso (That Kiss!), which I couldn't find anywhere else at a reasonable price. Not a great song, but fun."
5,great c.d.,"I haven't ever listened to this c.d. before. I don't own it either. I am also not planning on buying it. Jodan knight is pretty good though. I would have to say I am a fan. I rated this c.d. a 5, even though I've never heard it before. It could be a good c.d. It sounds like a pretty good c.d. to me. I'd say it defienately deserves five stars. This is a high quality five star c.d. By the way, don't grow a mullet."
5,Sex - Violence - Bad Language - Vodoo - and God????,"The Preacher Series is by far the coolest group of graphic novels I have ever read. This book isn't the best of the series, but it is awesome all on it's own. The story of Cassidy finding another like himself makes the book alone. The tale of him schooling another vampire makes the book, and of course, sets up later action. Still though, who would believe Arseface could make it as a singer? Another Sanjaya..... And what ever happened to the cool forewords by the cool people? I know there are some interesting semi-celebs out there who read Preacher. The whole series is awesome - Check it out"
2,Don't believe the hype...,"...the Preacher series is graphic literature's most over-rated example. Is it good? Somewhat. But you get the impression that the creative team is making it up as they go along, and, at this stage of the game, that's not a compliment. With this volume and the Preacher off-shoot Ancient History especially, the creative team of Ennis and Dillon have lost direction and are simply keeping it going with all the blood and guts and their attempts at gross-outs - which with this volume consistently miss their mark and are at this point redundant - only because, as far as I can tell, that's what they're paid to do. Don't get me wrong. Earlier volumes of this series are good - particularly ""Until the End of the World"" - and the later edition ""War In the Sun"" is also recommended, but Ennis and Dillon should take a cue from the likes of Gaiman, Miller, and Moore and stay focused on the story they're supposed to be telling and then, once that's finished - end the series."
3,Well...,"Good art (as always) but mediocre plotting (note: ""plotting"", not ""writing"". The writing is excellent) make this the least essential of the Preacher books. It's entertaining enough, I suppose, but feels soulless. Happily, you're not buying an issue a month, so you should wince your way through this storyline as quick as you can and then rush out and pick up the excellent 'War In The Sun'. Continue your enjoyment from there, and forget 'Dixie Fried' ever happened."
2,A Low Point in the Series,"I'm finding The Preacher to be wildly uneven. A great start, then it's gone downhill, with just enough perks along the way to keep me interested. Dixie Fried was the worst of the bunch. Aside from the entertaining first story about Cassidy meeting another of his kind, the bulk of it was just boring, contrived and frustrating. Ennis sort of ruins Cassidy in this one, and there's very little action at all. At this point I'm halfway through the series and will likely keep going, but my advice is to skip this one altogether, and find a synopsis online. Definitely not worth the money."
3,A mixed experience,"It starts off fine with cassidy at his best behaviour, battling that sonnuvabitch sheriff. After you go past the first vampire episode you realise that sadly this is the paperback that was destined to backfire, there`s something lacking, something not quite right. After a while i get the feeling that this part of the series has been done much on routine and sadly it affects the ominous feeling of pending doom that`s always present. I`ve noticed that the main characters are getting more brutal and ruthless issue by issue, sure what can you expect with Jesses upbringing and Cassidys condition but what about tulip? Her descent into righteous cruelty doesn`t seem logical it`s more like the writer changed her too fast and i don`t like it. The end of the paperback on the other hand was something else, when jesse realises what`s going on and who set it all up, it sends god damn shivers down the spines of any preacherfan. I`m ready for the next issue."
5,Great for mild pain relief,I was having a problem with a sore shoulder when I remembered that I had enjoyed a sample of this product and decided to buy the larger container. I love it. It smells wonderful and offers some relief from mild muscle pain/discomfort. I believe that the menthol in it makes your skin feel a little cold and tingly. Lather offers really great quality products and I was happy with this one.
2,Not Worth It,"""Then & Now"" is expected to show old and new photos of interesting places. But most locations are not interesting, like backyard pools, living room sofas, and taxi cab drivers. Most of the Before and After photos are not of the same location. It is a small book, with very little to offer. The captions are poorly written, with silly questions and comments, instead of useful information."
3,Coud be better,"Maybe it's because I am a native and resident of the valley. But the book does not appeal to me that much. Some of the then and now photos are unnecessary. Some are interesting. Overall, it could have been improved by showing photos of ""significant"" sites."
1,Horrid Menu! Terrible Editing! Not for beginners,"Be aware that this DVD begins with FIVE chapters all called ""Power Up: The Best of Rodney Yee"". Those chapters (which eat up a significant portion of the 80 minute DVD) contain Gaiam ads, Rodney Yee doing advanced yoga poses with NO instruction on what the poses are, how to breathe or position the body during the pose, what the names of the poses are, etc. Only approximately 14 minutes of the 80 minute DVD are usable for the beginner (Reflection and Surrender chapters). Mr. Yee seems to be an excellent teacher. It just seems that whoever produced this video edited it very poorly. The video should be marked ""Advanced"" somewhere on the DVD jacket. If you're a beginner, like I am, try Rodney Yee's Meditation & Yoga DVD. I thought that because Mr. Yee has been on Oprah and because this DVD was produced by Gaiam (who normally has great products) it would be a good DVD. I was wrong. Don't make the mistake I made: read the DVD reviews before you buy!"
1,Not one of Rodney/s best,I have several Rodney Yee videos (6) and I have enjoyed them all from his power yoga for beginners series to to yoga burn. But this one misses the mark. There is not real flow just a set of posture grouped together. Missing is that trademark Rodney Yee dynamic flow. Nothing about this felt helpful. This one won't join my regular rotation of Yee videos in my practice
2,"Not fluid, Terrible menu, No logical chapter placing","I like the poses, I like the hold length of a majority of the poses (some of the more difficult arm balancing poses could be held much longer, to give less than intermediates time to try, and advance yogis more time to hold the pose). The flow is terrible, every single section is broken up with a section of Rodney blabbing about the set of poses he is about to show you, and you cannot simply skip past it, you have to carefully ""fast forward"" because the dvd is not split into smaller skip-able chapters or sections. I like smooth fluid practice, and this frankly does not cut it. As always, Rodney is amazing, and his DVD menu sucks."
2,not his best for sure,"to hard to hear with the back ground sounds you have to watch it and then follow along, just not what i want to do"
5,Excellent Yoga Workout,"I recommend the Yoga Journal's Energy Balance Yoga over the full body workout dvd. You get the same stances and more. Furthermore, names of the poses are given with the Energy Balance Yoga dvd far more often than with this one. Once you practice each position you could do them without looking at the dvd, but the total body workout moves you into a position and forgets to tell you the name of the position.However there are some instructions regarding use of props within the total body workout that is not in the Energy Balance dvd.If you enjoy a great workout and simple for most anyone to do at least 90% of the poses, then this workout is really beneficial."
2,NOT FOR BEGINNERS,"I have been doing yoga for 18 months so when this video said it was beginner/intermediate, I figured I fit into that category... he doesn't tell you how to do the poses. Plus it left me feeling really frustrated with my lack of flexibility with the yogis on the video. It really wasn't a good experience. I invested in props to help me through but he goes so fast that you can't keep up. Start somewhere else first- I doubt that most average people will ever approach the level on this tape!"
5,One of the best Yoga videos I have seen.,This Yoga video has a great flow of movements and different segements geared for centering ones mind and body. I highly reccomend it for people who have some experience with Yoga movements and positions.
3,"Good, but fast paced","I have been practicing Yoga for several years now both at home and in a class setting. I feel that this video is good, but it is too fast paced. What I like about Yoga are the gentle movements and postures that, when held for a period of time, stretch and tone all muscle groups. I feel that by moving quickly through the postures, my muscles do not stretch as much and therefore I feel disappointed at the end of the workout. In fact, I sometimes skip portions of the video and combine it with another video I own or create my own workout."
2,Not for beginners,"This is more like watching a yoga performance. No help for beginners with directions for assuming the poses or possible modifications. If you know yoga well enough to use this tape, you probably don't need it. Natural and cosmic. Fades to sunset beaches. Susan Deason's tapes Yoga Remedies for Balance and Yoga Conditioning for Weigh Loss were much better for me. I would not recommend this tape."
2,Not recommended if you're new to yoga,"I found that this video had no explanation of what each position meant, how to control your breathing, which body part each position targeted and so on. If you've had some experience in yoga, this may not be a bad product but if you're new to yoga, I would NOT use this tape."
5,The best yet,"I think evan Rodney Yee said, in an interview, that this was the best tape he has made thus far. Although that interview was given back in 1999, or so. I think this is his best video, of the ones I have seen. I did this every day for 6 months, the middle three workouts, and got in great shape. this is just a great healthy way to get in shape. If you have never done Yoga before, you might want to do the Patrica Walden ""Yoga for Beginners"" for one or two weeks, and then go to the ""Yoga for Energy"" tape."
4,Energy,"This is definitely not for the yoga neophyte. And you should definitely view the tape at least twice before beginning practice. However, I must say that this tape was all that it promised to be and much more.Rodney Yee guides you through five seesions designed to give you more energy and help you get more in tune with the elements. I like that there isn't a whole lot of talking in the tape and you can focus on your poses and breathing. As someone who was looking to round out my yoga practice, I found the tape to be challenging without being frustrating and to actually deliver on the promise of renewed energy.I would suggest this tape for anyone who is ready to move beyond basic poses."
4,"Pretty great, but needs a longer warm up section","I really enjoyed this video. I appreciated its format of little chatter, and the asanas chosen are terrific. My only gripe is the warm up section is a little short, and doesn't quite get your muscles as loose as they perhaps should be. Overall, a wonderfull video."
3,"I wouldn't call it Yoga for ""Energy""","I was expecting this tape to be more of a Power Yoga tape. This tape is basically stretching and poses, and in my opinion he doesn't hold the poses long enough. I hardly got my heart rate going; it is not an intermed or advanced tape whatsoever. I've been doing power yoga occasionally for a few years now, and consider myself beginner/intermediate, and this tape was way too easy (and boring) for me. I do think it's relaxing, and the scenery is nice, and I like the cues and little talk. However, direction and guidance are necessary for people who are not familiar with the poses (which could be risky), so this tape may not be best for brand new beginners. And it is only 40 min's, if that."
5,Best outside of a class!,"This video as well as the others that comprise the beginners practice series is the best outside of a classroom. As Patricia Walden states in Yoga practice for Flexability, these tapes are supplemental to your weekly Yoga Practice! These tapes are very well done and really teach you the fundamentals of Yoga. And YES the third segement ""Creativity"" I believe, does seem to move quickly, BUT of ALL the segements, this one teaches the breath/body movements. I.E. one exhalation to get into the pose, then Inhale, exhale fully while moving into the next pose. THIS IS what YOGA IS. If you don't link the breath with the movements then it's gymnastics!"
4,Buy this book.,"If you only buy one real estate book in your life, make sure it is this one. Clear, concise, easy to follow. You cannot lose money buying this.This is not just a rich dad/poor dad book. This one works."
5,Very good Quality,I'm not a mechanic...LOL..but the prevoius brake bands my toyota highlander used to have did not weight anything..and my front wheels always had brake dust all over. I purchased this product and when I looked at it seemed to be the best quality and each pad weighted more than the 4 older pieces. I recomend this 100 porcent.
2,Buy A Different Edition,"Flatland is an excellent book: clever, insightful, and a joy to read. But this ""dry bones"" version is not the one to get. I bought this because I thought crediting the author as ""A Square"" was a cute idea, and while I still enjoyed the book, the main problem is that this one has TONS of typos. I forgave a few at first, but then I almost couldn't believe my eyes as I was running into at least one typo per page, throughout surprisingly long sections.That was the only problem I had with this book, but for me, it was a big problem, and greatly detracted from my reading experience. If it doesn't sound like something that will bother you, by all means pick up this copy - you'll enjoy it. If you're like me, though, and you want the books you read to have survived a spell-check (at least!), then I highly recommend buying a more professionally produced edition."
3,"Beautiful gothic music, but nothing special","German act Flowing Tears tried this time a heavier approach to the gothic feel of their music. Stefanie's beautiful voice is a bit more low tone, and guitars are also a bit more distorted.I think FT have the talent, but they must make the next step to becoming a great gothic band.Anyway, 'Serpentine' will pleased gothic rock/metal fans who doesn't expect a masterpiece in every album or band they listen.Three stars."
2,High hopes dashed by lackluster effort,I am of the opinion that Flowing Tears put out one of the best albums in the last five years with Jade. I eagerly awaited this follow up. When I heard it though I could not help but be disappointed. It starts out o.k. but never really seems to build any momentum or go anywhere. Where Jade was consistently interesting Serpentine is downright boring. I guess all the fresh ideas have just ran out. I also thought lyrics were a strong point on Jade and an exceptionally weak point on Serpentine. Starfish Ride along with others are just plain horrendous. I will buy their next album but with far lower hopes.
3,disappointingly generic,"Flowing Tears' previous album Jade was a compelling album full of somber melodies highlighted by Stefanie Duchene's plaintive vocals. While not exactly goth or doom metal, it was still a welcome departure from the usual run of female-fronted rock bands. Serpentine, however, leans more toward the generic and is not as memorable; few of the songs stick in the mind as the ones on Jade. There is not much to say about it except that it is too ordinary. Let's hope their next effort puts them back on track."
5,Father of The 7-string guitar,"I've been a pro jazz guitarist for more yrs. than I'd care to admit, but, & I've tried, but the 7-string guitar was so difficult that I sold it. What can I say that hasn't already been said about this man. He was the master of this instrument.Basically, what he's doing is accompanying himself using the low A as the bass string. Some use B; depends on the player.The only comparison that comes to mind is someone like Jimmy Smith, famous jazz organist, who plays solo using the pedals on the Hammond.I originally got this as an Lp (mono) many yrs. ago & now have it on CD (still mono). Van Eps is like an old friend & I'm glad he made those 3 CDs with Howard Alden before he died. Alden plays 6 & 7 string guitar.His playing is smooth, mellow & technically flawless. My favorites on this album are ""Let's Do It'"" ""Yesterdays"" & ""Have You Met Miss Jones.""Your jazz collection would be terribly incomplete without this recording."
2,Don't be fooled,"Don't be fooled. This is advertised as solo guitar, but it is not. The guitar music is great, but the strings, etc. ruin the whole experience!"
3,LFC,"Lucy's Fur Coat rocks -- that's the bottom line. Jaundice, released in 1994, was insane with tracks that kept you comin back for more. But then LFC kind of faded away from the scene. Until now. But after 4 years of putting together new songs and whatnot, I was kind of dissapointed with Air Crash. First of all, it only has 9 musical tracks; second of all, its only 30 minutes long. I thought with four years on their hands they could come up with something more than what they put out. Sure the songs on the album are good, but I was kind of expecting more than what they delivered. So there's the reason why its 3 stars."
3,Solid mix of text and photos,"Mick Wall, writer of the Iron Maiden official biography ""RUN TO THE HILLS"", wrote this book back in 1985, and it is totally out of print by now... It's a good book, not even near the best rock biography ever written, but it does the job. It has very good photos and it gives a good general frame of Ozzy's career up to that point. In this age of Internet, all the information contained here could be obtained without buying the book."
3,Decent Book,Its A Decent Book For The Time Frame But I Wish There Was An Expanded Version To Incumpass The Next 20 Years Which He Has Done Alot More
3,Thin and Small,"I bought this for my daughter and she didn't like it at all because of thin material and it's small. If she doesn't use it, what's good about it?"
1,NOT TURBIE TWIST!!!,This item should not come out if looking for wonderful Turbie Twists!! This is too small and material is thin and does not work if person has actual hair. I was very disappointed and can not give these now to my friends like planned. I will never recommend this product to anyone. I have had Turbie Twist for years and real ones are amazing!
3,Thin material but adequate,This towel isn't exactly thick and lush but I have thin shoulder length hair so it can suck up enough water to work for me. If I had more hair I think I would be disappointed.
1,Just awful,"I'd had a Turbie Twist for many years, and figured it was time to replace it, so I purchased several of these (the April Brand) from the Dollar Tree, thinking they were the same thing. Boy was I mistaken.This item is NOT a Turbie Twist. The April Brand is very thin & cheaply made. It has a harsh feel compared to the real Turbie Twist. It isn't soft and comfortable at all. If you have alot of hair, forget trying to use this knock off brand as well, as it won't hold your hair at all! Plus, the connecting lope breaks within a few months of use. Every single one I got broke. It was a major disappointment.This item is not to be mistaken for the wonderful Turbie Twist! http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00139XON2/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i02They are well worth the extra price, as the quality is exceptional.The terry cloth is thick like a egyptian cotton bath towel, and the connection loop is solid."
3,hair towel,"I have purchased other brands before and I was a little dissappointed with this one. It is a little smaller in size and the material is thinner than my other ones. It still works well, just not great."
4,Towel Hair Wrap,You get exactly what you pay for. Thin microfiber towel. But does the job and worth the price. Light pink is cute.
4,Excellent Beginning Resource,"I have been purchasing the entire HowDunnit Series from Writer's Digest. I have been for the mostpart, impressed with how in depth each book is. This a good synposis of the series in one volume. My disappointment came mainly from the section on Autopsies. I wanted there to be more from the book it was exerpted from. Also, I would love to see the book ""Police Procedural"" come back into print. I would recommend it to anyone who is writing fiction about cops, detectives and forensic professionals."
5,Great gift,"Got this as a gift for a friend from Texas. Not for heavy duty everyday use, but great for parties (i.e.: cheese board) or the bar in your house. It looks really cute."
3,too pricey,"I first saw this board offer and thought it a unique item. After purchasing, I happen to see the exact same item at a local vendor for half what I paid for it! Needless to say, I was not happy, which is why I gave it 3 stars. That said, the quality of the board is very nice and is a good replica of the state of Texas."
4,"desperately seeking ""Shoot the Moon"" (stunning!)","Judie's work is incredible, the music is intelligent, thoughtful, artistic & a total pleasure to listen to.I'm frustrated that her past work is ne impossible to get hold of! Shoot the Moon, Road Noise - both absolutely brilliant albums/track listings - where are they?regarding this album, it includes an adequate portfolio, but of course, the live versions of: ""Hunter"" is ommitted, the haunting ""For You"" surpasses itself live, as does ""'Til Dawn""I was pleased to see ""Southern Smiles & ""These are the Laws"" - but it is like a taster that leaves you craving to hear ""new friends again""/""Bring the Rain"" + her other great tracks,My vision is that one day Judie will release a ""true"" compilation album including all these, plus those fantastic tracks on ""shoot the moon""."
1,Not even close to YMOYL,"Should be subtitled, ""How Two Seattle Yuppies Retired Early on 3.5K a Month"". This book contains some helpful info, but I was hoping to see someone with a negative net worth pay off their debts and become FI. What I got was the story of a couple of yuppies saying, ""Whoa, were worth a bundle and if we refuse to pay for our kids' college we can retire early"". Not too impressive to me. I would not read this book if I were looking for material on voluntary simplicity. Why does Vicki Robin endorse this book?"
1,Reward for yuppie-dom,"This couple's contention that they are living simply is a joke. It's easy to choose voluntary simplicity when you can live off the interest of your investments. I also understand that one of their tenets is to borrow whenever possible, including borrowing a friend's van to transport a group of other VS types to a gathering. During the trip, the van broke down. Did Mr. Heitmiller offer to pay for the repairs? Oh, heck no, it wasn't his fault because the van was due to break down. Guess the friend won't be able to adopt the VS lifestyle because he will have to work to pay for the repairs. Mooching off your friends doesn't qualify as VS, does it? People who are living the VS lifestyle because their economic situation forces them to do so are in a better position to write a book about how it's done. People with a million bucks in the bank have a rather comfy cushion."
3,Works but could be better,"As a teacher I have used this book for classroom instruction. I highly recommend the Routledge Colloquial Series for learning practical use of any language, though this book has fallen below the standard of most other books in the series. A large number of the texts are difficult for students to relate to. (Inflation, government announcements, etc. that have little practical use for a student who wants to learn to communicate in everyday life) The order of some of the lessons is hard to follow (learning present perfect and present perfect continuous before learning past tense for example) and in many instances precious little detail is given about grammatical structure. I recommend Routledge Colloquial Spanish by Untza Otaola Alday over this book. Spanish spoken in Spain is close enough that there shouldn't be any significant issue, and Untza's book is much better structured and easier to relate to.Colloquial Spanish (Colloquial Series (Multimedia))"
3,Helpful only if combined with the book,"Being able to listen to spoken Latin American Spanish, with a translation available (from the book) should be helpful for our upcoming trip."
1,Don't order this product,"I ordered this product on June 28th and it took 3 months for it to arrive!!! I think that alone disqualifies anyone from ever wanting it, but also, it glides through SPanish as though the individual is already fully conversant in Spanish, ie, has had at least 4+ years in school. I don't believe it's very useful, especially for the cost [$25.99] and wait!"
4,My cat seems to like them,"When Pepito was diagnosed with kidney failure, I started researching options to help him any way I could. I came upon these supplements and decided to give them a shot since they are pretty cheap. He seemed to feel a lot better as soon as he started taking them: more energy, better mood, etc. His kidney values have been good too. He wont eat them on their own though, I have to encase them in a pill pocket. They're pretty big so I started by breaking them in half and putting each half in a pill pocket. They are a little hard and he has bad teeth, that would probably be his only complaint, haha."
3,renal essence,My cats dont like these. They need to be split with a pill cutter and hidden inside a pill pocket.
4,KYB SHOCKS,"I bought these shocks to replace a leaking shock on my 2003 GMC Sonoma . So I decided to replace all 4 with KYB. I did not notice a big difference from to old GM shocks to the new KYB ones. I have bought this brand before when I had a 2000 S10 with a ZQ8 suspension, and loved the ride. But the new ones are a little to soft for me. That is why I gave it a 4 out of 5. The shocks are a good deal for the money."
1,BO-RING,"I bought this text as required for a course, but as it was intended as a supplementary text and not the main text, I didn't get a chance to read it then. I finally read the whole thing recently, and BOOOOOOOOOOOO. I found nothing illuminating, was bored by the text ... so many things that would be excusable in other books. But this is a book about ELA. If you can't entice people who love teaching ELA with a book about teaching ELA, then something's really wrong with you."
5,Fashionably organized,I recently remodeled mi kitchen with all stainless steel appliances and wanted by inner cabinets to match with the modern vibe of the kitchen so I bought this organizer to replace my old white wire ones.It is easy to install and spacious enough to fashionably organize all the pots and pans in my kitchen.It looks great and it's very sturdy.Will be proud to show my friends my new kitchen including my inner cabinets.
5,Excellent Sourcebook to the Robotech RPG that allows you to play during The Invid Invasion timeline,"The Invid Invasion Sourcebook allows players to experience Invid infested Earth with 7 new character classes, (One being a repeat) and over a dozen new skills included. REF and Invid mecha are presented in their entirety, (albiet ships and some noticeable mistakes) as well as some additional weapons and vehicles. Out of the 4 timelines, this book has the most background information incluing all NPC stats and extensive detail on the Invid. Fans of Robotech or the RPG can't go wrong buying this book."
3,Robotech RPGs are a mixed bag,"On the one hand, they have some nostalgia value to meOn the other, nostalgia fades quicklyIf you like RPGs from Palladium Books and I still do, despite a divergence of tastes since I started playing games in the 80's, then by all means, grab this up. Will it be useful? To me, it was more for the completing of a set of these game books than any desire to play but I expect that's more a disenchantment with this style of story than anything inherently wrong with the game.The game is simple and contains easy to follow instructions for play so getting started is not too complicated. I would recommend re-familiarizing yourself with the show if possible as well, to reconnect the creative juices and make sure you hit the right notes in storyline construction. But, yeah, there is some real fun you can have here, so if you want a fight against remorseless foes in a post-apocalyptic setting where giant robots are the weapons of choice, then go for it."
3,A long -winded read,"I recently was given the book to read and I too could not put it down. It does need editing, is irritating to a degree because of the childlike references to bodyparts, ect. I think that there is a great story in there somewhere. I enjoy a book that laughs at itself, and this one is howling."
4,Early Settlers and Indian fighters of southwest Texas,Good history of early Texas. Easy to read and good insights to life at that time. Well worth the purchase price.
3,I think I bought the wrong movie...,"I was looking for the movie Forgiveness with Arnold Vosloo and I thought that's what I had purchased. The description of the one with Mr. Vosloo is identical to this in description and packaging, however he was never in it. I watched the entire thing even the bonus features, scenes ,etc just in case I missed it but I hadn't. This documentary is very well done about the powere, negative and positive, of forgiveness but since it wasn't what I was looking for I wasn't thrilled watching it."
3,"Good intro (Tarski's World!), limited to standard models.","This is an excellent introduction to first order predicate logic. The book is most valuable because of the supplementary Tarski's World program which helps the reader to visualize and practise logic. The only drawback is that without much comment the authors use an *interpreted* language, i.e. the intended meaning of, for example, ""left of"" is represented in the models, in other words, only standard models are considered. This also leads to ad hoc distinctions between, e.g., ""tautology"" and ""logical validity"". However, in school or university, this disadvantage can be repaired by giving the complementary view in the lectures.The book has been used in our curriculum (major Language and AI, Tilburg University) over a number of years and with considerable success. For the novice, I even prefer it over our own Dutch text book (van Eijck & Thijsse - Logica voor Alfa's en Informatici, Academic Serice, 1989)."
1,Rubbish! Absolute and Total Rubbish! Riddled with factuals errors on every page.,"As a Dutchman I have to say that, in my entire and long life, I have never - ever - read a single book that was so factually inaccurate with blatant errors and misinterpretations on virtually every single page!Has a Dutch person ever read this piece of manure before it went to press? Obviously the authors - both non-Dutch (why? they couldn't find a local [out of 14 million people?] to write this?) have absolutely no idea what nonsense they are ejaculating on page and after page. This is self-evident from the notes about the authors on pages 220 and 221: ""Hunt Janin (an American) `visits the Netherlands frequently' while Ria van Eil has obviously spent way too much time abroad to have kept an accurate finger on the pulse).This ""guide"" is absolutely rubbish and I grieve for the trees that had to die for this pathetic attempt. I can only shudder at the credibility level of the other volumes."
3,Great Transformer,My only complaint for this toy is that is was a great deal smaller than I thought. But it is easy to transform which is good for my nephew who this was for and is pretty durable for little hands.
2,Not really intermediate,"Could have been better. Now that i am definitely in need of advanced, leave alone intermediate, it was a disappointment. It gave only a couple of very basic inverted poses and that is all. I wish for a more advanced program with advanced versions of all poses and inverted poses."
3,OK,"The content on this DVD is only slightly better than a beginners DVD. The inverted poses were challenging, but there were no other poses performed that were unique to an ""intermediate"" program."
4,"Good, not great","I really like Rodney Yee's stuff. I find him to go easy on the woo-woo stuff, and good with instruction. This DVD has a ok sun salutation sequence and a good inversions section and not much else. I would have liked to see more, but its a decent addition to my collection of his teaching. Hard to go really wrong with Rodney Yee"
3,Rodney Yee Intermediate Yoga,"This is an instructional dvd, it has about twenty min of flow and then Rodney shows you how to do head stands and other intermediate poses. If you are looking for an intructional dvd then this is for you and as always Rodney is a fantastic instructor. However I purchased this thinking I was going to challenge myself and get into the harder stuff. I was not able to use it and gave it away after one viewing."
3,Beginner to intermediate...,"I just love Rodney Yee... he is probably one of the best yoga teachers out there. I've also been lucky enough to practice with him in person! However, I have to tell ya, this dvd is not much different than his power yoga dvd... The major difference being the inversions. As a yoga teacher myself, If I were to teach an intermediate level class I would do more inversions. Either way, this is an excellent dvd to use for any level, but if you're looking to be challenged and you have over 3 years experience you might want more...TAMARA'S YOGA FUSION"
4,Anything free is top notch,"Got this leveler free with some pliers. Nothing fancy, basic leveling. It makes things straight, and that is what's important!!!"
3,"""It's OK""","Torpedo levels have limited useage. This is quality made, but you can pick up a 2.99 special at any auto part store that will match both in quality and service.If you don't have one and need a tool that you will use on rare occassions in your box, this is a good price. Otherwise, there are many other offers in Amazon to spend your money on."
4,Too Short,"It's fine for simple uses around home, but it is awefully short for serious constructional purposes."
4,Is What It Is,Needed a smaller level to hang blinds in the house.Product worked well. Magnet on back side helped out.Dropped the product on hard surface a couple times with no breakage.Good buy
5,First class BBC spy action /adventure set in Iceland,"Ex-secret agent Alan Stewart is blackmailed by his former boss Slade to deliver a mysterious package. It seems a simple messenger boy's job, but on a lonely road in Iceland, things take a dramatic turn, and he finds himself and his Icelandic girlfriend being pursued by his KGB enemy Kenniken across the wild, volcanic landscape. BBC Scotland TV production released in 1979 with Stuart Wilson, George Sewell and Vladek Sheybal. Although slightly '70's dated, this is still a first class adventure yarn."
5,"Cold, ruthless and totally enjoyable!","Being a 1970's production by the BBC the plain fact that they really went to Iceland shows the commitment they made to this splendid thriller. A totally unique (in its day) tight and engrossing chase through the barren ""out-back"" of this unfamiliar island, makes for a great evening's entertainment. If you can't get a hold of this video then read the book instead and find out why Desmond Bagley is one of the un-sung heros of this hard-to-get-right genre."
2,insane,"This is not a good library of piano music. The reason is, there is too much repetition. I'm not saying the series is bad. The series is wonderful. But this collection as a whole is a bad libary. For the same money you could collect together (with more effort) an incredible libary of piano music. There are so many wonderful cd's out there, this is just a waste of money. If you can actually afford to spend 2 grand on piano music, then either (1) spend the time and do some research to get a good library of piano music, which will probably include some selections from this collection, or (2) hire someone to do that for you. Personally I would be embarrassed to own this whole collection, since that shows I have put little thought into my purchases of piano music."
4,A True American Patriot,"St. Clair uses brillant style in this text that defends his character. After reading this work, it is quite clear that the defeat of St. Clair's army at the hands of Little Turtle was not the old general's fault, but blame should be directed at the government for corruption.This is a great book for anyone interested in early American history, or US - Native American warfare."
4,awesome single player,"This is totally an awesome game. You are leader of an elite squad of counter-terrorists, and you must save the world. The single player in this game is absoultly great, the levels are well thought-out, and the gameplay itself is dope. And the graphics, the graphics are incredibly done by Ubisoft. The whole game is just cool, it's fun to pretend you are Ding Chavez hunting down terrorists (especially on the alcatraz level, which reminded me alot of the move ""The Rock""). It is probably the second best (Halo being number 1) 1st-person-shooter 1st player game i've ever played. There is but one problem. The multi-player. I was expecting more of a Ghost Recon type deal, but that it is not. TI is far too fast-paced, laggy and there are way too many tacky explosions, but all in all, it is a great title from the Tom Clancy series, can't wait for Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow."
4,Pretty good game,"This game was actually pretty good, its right up there with Ghost Recon. The only thing i hated about this game(and why it wont get 5 stars) is that there was no split screen co op mode like in Halo or Ghost Recon. Still a very good game but u may want to rent it first."
4,Beautiful tactical shooter,"A lot like Ubi's other tactical shooter franchise (Ghost Recon) except for whatever reason, they employ native voice actors throughout this franchise's history (they also sound French or German in this one)...goofy. ""Roger...Open UND clear"" Playable on the 360. If you have Vegas, give it a try, it ain't bad."
3,Not for me... a 45 year old gamers review.,"I purchased this game for my new xbox... and as a 45 year old man, this game is way too hard to play. I am looking to relax and need something simple. Too many commands. I am sure the game is great but it was just too complicated for me to enjoy."
4,zulu go!,"This is an exellent game! it is insanely hard but that makes it more realistic (if you dont want to get killed you can enter a code on each level to put you in ""god"" mode). the graphics are some of the best i've seen and the weapons are AWESOME! its also really nice to be able to make somebody else (on your team) open a door for you and clear the room! if you like combat games and or tom clancy you MUST have this game."
4,Great Game,"This game has fun 1 player missions, but it is just awesome on Xbox Live. Playing through the missions with a team of your pals is a blast. There is also team survivor, sharpshooter, and other multiplayer options. Best FPS since Halo. Only thing missing is a split-screen option. I'd really rate it 4.5 stars, Halo was a 5."
4,=A MUST GET!=,This game is a blast. You wont be dissapointed. I have all the other games of Tom Clancys for the PC. I got an Xbox for Christmas and Rainbow Six 3 was the first game I went out and bought. The first day I played it for 10+ hours. If you like ANY of the other Tom Clancy games this is a must have for you collection. It is also tons of fun to play on the internet.
2,Splinter Cell is better,"i'll make it short. i just played splinter cell before i played Rainbow Six 3. This game just has basic shoot the bad guy stratagy. too basic. splinter cell goes in much deeper, using wall bombs, spying, real effects, hiding in the dark ALOT more!"
2,I wish the voice commands worked properly.,Gameplay is good but the voice commands only fuction about 80% of the time; very annoying. I had to give up on the voice commands and use the buttons.
3,Misleading Packaging,"Great game, but the package says multiplayer. It does not specify you MUST have X-box live for multiplayer only. I love to play with my husband and don't want to have X-box live for gameplay. I enjoy Halo's split screen multiplayer action. This game is excellent as far as play and graphics."
4,Very cool game,this is a very good game i recommend this game to anyone who likes good first person shooters and this IS a good one but rent it before u buy it it has a good storyline and ALOT of weapons to choose from i mean im only on the third level and it is pretty challenging but its an awsome game if ur smart u will buy this game
1,"Roger, moving now!!","man, these people are slow. they say ""roger, mooning now"" even if they walk a couple of steps. there are too many stupid mexicans going around saying ""POLICIA. POLICIA"" they all even look the same, except wearing different clothes. the only best part about this game is when I am in GOD mode.Don't buy this game!! Buy HALO 2 or HALO!!!!!!!!"
1,BUYER BEWARE--BP MEDICAL SUPPLIES DOES NOT HONOR THIS LISTING!,"BP MEDICAL SUPPLIES will not honor their listing!The item description I purchased was for 2 sets of 12-PACK bars, what I received were 2 INDIVIDUAL bars. I was shorted 22 bars of soap. Repeated attempts to resolve this matter were met with ""sorry, technical error, Amazon's fault, your order was for 2 individual bars"". When presented with the facts and screenshots proving I ordered two 12-PACK sets equalling 24 bars, the company stopped communication. Fraudlent listing and horrible company. NEVER will I order from this company again. You will NOT get a refund from this company or the remainder of your order. BUYER BEWARE!BTW--Aveeno fragrance free soap is fine, unscented, and a blessing if you have perfume-driven migraines, just find a reputable supplier. Don't buy it from BP MEDICAL SUPPLY."
3,Very good exfoliate,"I was tired of applying lotion every time I got out of the shower to combat my dry skin. So, I decided to buy a moisturizing soap so I can cut back on how often I have to apply lotion.The smell of this soap isn't that pleasant. It says ""Fragrance Free"", but it reminds me of the smell of my multivitamins. However, the smell doesn't linger. Actually, you can't even really smell it while showering. Just if you actually smell the bar.The texture is gritty if you apply the bar directly to the skin. It's not too abrasive, just the right amount. So, I now use this instead of a body scrub! Works very well.I haven't noticed my skin to be any softer. At all. I still have to use lotion every time I get out of the shower. I'll keep using it and update this review if circumstances change. But, as of now, I'll have to say this failed at moisturizing my skin."
5,Great Soap!,This is a great soap for people with irritated skin. I got it for someone who has psoriasis and washes his hands alot during the day. All the other soaps made his hands red and irritated. This soap seems to be very soothing. Great product!
3,"It is okay, but not for me",This is a good product but not for me I have a very sensitive face and it doesn't help my face is red a lot of the time not from the product just because I am a diabetic and my face is so dry. I have to use a not soap product.
5,contemporary accessibility of an ancient practice,"This book is amazing! It has completely turned my life around for the better. I've lost a ton of weight, my love life has taken off and my day-to-day interactions with people and friends have improved. Master Jay makes it so accessible and fun, almost easy to follow your Tao and everything really will fall into place. And his web site, Zenzone3.com, has weekly activities to aid in self-awareness and self-love but without the outrageous ego trap. I've read this book three times already and I always find something I missed before. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is searching for something but they cannot name it. Buy the book!"
1,Mostly Useless Generic Information,"If you are interested in a medical claims processing business this is NOT the book to buy. It only contains a generic ""How to open a new business"" guide full of generalities. It has virtually NO USEFUL information about medical claims processing. The author seems to have published a whole series of these books and they only differ from one another in their title and the references to the TYPE of business without any real info. It is a scam to avoid."
4,Silly fun,"This is a pretty silly film, but it has a huge cast of some of the greats in small but interesting little parts. It is mostly Shirley, but when you throw in Dean Martin, Dick Van Dyke, Robert Mitchum, Paul Newman and Gene Kelly doing their marvelous piece of the story it makes for an enjoyable couple of hours.Try it, you'll like it"
4,Fun movie...,"What a great throw-back... The fashions are fabulous, the editing is great, it is an awesome movie that is risque, but family-friendly. If you want a good laugh, get this movie! (BTW, my twice-divorced mother-in-law thought that it was a riot!!!!)"
5,Classic!,The cast of A-list actors is amazing!! I have loved this movie since discovering it on late night TV in my teens.
5,"Fun, Funny Movie","This movie is full of big name stars, poking fun at the industry in a very fun way. It is a great story that is great to watch over and over. It is also a great gift for people who love all the movies and actors or the 50's."
5,Every Time,Every time i find this movie on tv i find it 5 minutes to ending. I am so happy it is finally being released on video. I saw this movie probably when i was in about 5th grade and i fell in love with it and still am at the age of 17. The movie is hilariously funny with shirley mclaine not wanting to marry this rich snob because she thinks hes full of himself. Instead she falls in love with a poor man who happens to get rich and keels over. She marries again and again and each time the same thing happens. It is a great classic movie and i am so excited it is finally out. If you are willing to check this movie out i suggest it very much so.
5,Shirely MacLaine at her best!,Is there a Shirley MacLaine movie not to like?! Lots of stars lots of fun! Easy to watch!
5,The wait is over!!!,"OMG I cannot believe they are actually releasing this on dvd!! OMG!!! I love this movie!!! It's hilarious with all the married lives played out and ending all the same way, full of stars and gret to look out. The case is pink and even bubble-gum flavored!"
5,Really fun film.,This CLASSIC film is one I'm glad I got a copy of.With all the great stars in it...I'll be watchingthis over and over. A Fun and funny film.
4,Shirley MacLaine is so DANG cute!,"This was another movie purchased for Paul Newman Night. What a wonderful treat! The nod to several different movie genre was PERFECT!Since my focus for the movies I'm reviewing is Paul Newman I will start there. Mr. Newman plays Larry Flint (how weird is that?), an American in Paris (I am smiling as I write that because that is another all time favorites of mine) He is a struggling artist. But aren't we all?The French movies from the 50s and 60s with the bohemian lifestyle is the theme here and Shirley MacLaine is big-haired and turtle necked when she has clothes on. Paul Newman is bearded and scruffy. They roll in the sheets and bathe together in a funny scene. I am surprised that one of them doesn't pass out. They are kissing the whole time. I won't tell about the whole movie since its been covered pretty well here.Paul Newman is funny and full of himself and his art.I wish he was my neighbor."
4,What A Way To Spend An Evening,"Corny, kooky, silly, over-the-top, and just plain old fun, What A Way To Go showcases an early in her career Shirley MacLaine as a young woman who becomes a multi-millionairess as a result of the early demises of her many wealthy husbands. Of note are the wonderfully outrageous costumes designed by Edith Head, and the fantasy numbers imagined by MacLaine. Best are the old Hollywood musical number with Gene Kelly, in which we are reminded that MacLaine was quite the hoofer in her day, and with Robert Mitchum, in which MacLaine parades an amazing line of gowns. With as many wigs. A great way to spend of couple of hours."
4,It's a classic period piece,"I remember seeing this when I was very young, and loving it then.I searched for it for years and finally found it here on Amazon.It did not disappoint. Of course, I understood much more of the movie as an adult, so it was doubly enjoyable; a star cast.. you cannot go wrong.Even my college-aged nephew watched it with me and enjoyed it."
5,versatile and rugged,"these scooters have many uses and the children love them.For non-child use, they are outstanding for large plants!"
5,Best of the best,"This CD is a must for all MH fans. Only the 1st track (A Straight Line) is available on the ""Michael Hutchence"" album. So this is a collector's item. All three tracks are excellent, musically, lyrically and vocally... Go for it!!!"
2,Old Bugs Character,I'm pretty sure I'm reviewing the right tape here. It's 30 minutes long and is from Kids Klassics. There's no image shown on the previous web page but everything else matches up with the tape I have.These cartoons feature the old version of bugs bunny from the 1940s.I gave it 2 stars since I don't like this incarnation of Bugs.I don't know exactly when they transformed Bugs into the more familiar version which to me was his best incarnation. Probably in the 1950s sometime.They took some of these great stories like Falling Hare and created new versions I think with the newer Bugs.Jeff Marzano
1,WOW!,"I received my books, I ordered some that were used and in the description it said all books were there. What i did not know was that 7 of the books were Christmas books. Well i requested to return it and to find out i'm going to have to pay to ship it back so now i'm stuck with 7 christmas books and only 5 of the books i wanted for my daughter. It would cost about as much as i paid for the books to ship them back so it's not worth it. THANKS A LOT! If i could i would have given this 0 stars I would, I would have bought it brand new if it were on here for a reasonable price."
2,Littlest Angel Review,"Nothing like the original, it's been dumbed down and the drawings are too 21st century. Not my thing at all - I was looking for the book o my childhood!"
5,This should be a classic in every child's library,This is a beautifully written story with equally wonderful illustrations. It would seem a little advanced for a toddler however both my 3 and 6 year old love this story. It will tug on your heart strings...
2,A Ruined Classic,"I love ""The Littlest Angel"" by Charles Tazewell illustrated by Katherine Evans. It is precious and fun, but, having read this version, encourage people to look for the original. For those of you who don't like big words, this is a good version because they have changed the original text and omitted many of the quaint words our society has almost lost from our collective vocabulary."
5,A Christmas Tradition,"Our family also has a longstanding Christmas tradition of reading this book on Christmas Eve before bedtime. I usually get so choked up midway through that someone else has to finish reading it. Even now that the kids are in high school/college, they still like to keep up the tradition. I'm sure they will continue it when they have families of their own. My mother read this book to me all the time when I was growing up and this is the version that I have and love the best. It has the best illustrations in my opinion."
2,"The most verbose, convoluted ""childrens"" book ever","The language used in the book is nearly incomprehensible to most adults, much less children. It feels like the author is trying to show off a grand vocabulary more than trying to tell a story. His choices of words are astoundingly complicated and often ill-suited to the story. Its just not a good kids story. Heck, its not even that good of a story in general. And the language is unjustifiably verbose and convoluted."
2,Newer is not always better,"My mother passed on our childhood copy of this book, and it is one of my favorite books to give for gifts to children. Alas, the larger version with illustrations by Leone is much more magical. Find it if you can."
2,Disappointing,"I know this is a hard book to find and I am grateful to find a decent copy. However, The book was described as like new - collectible. I received a clearly used book, with some bent pages, a broken binding and some small tears in the cover. It isn't horrible, but it certainly isn't like new."
2,Theological garbage,"I grabbed this book off the library shelf on a whim based on the title. I sat down to read it with my five year old only to be disturbed by the theology. Heaven is perfect. There will be no irritation, sadness, disobedience, punishment. These are all depicted in the story. Angels are beings created by god to be just that, angels. They are not dead children.I enjoyed the larger adult words. I thunk it's important to expose children to such language. And admittedly the ending is sweet and touching. If only it weren't so incorrect it could be a great story."
5,Great book.,"This is a great read, but be forewarned that it is about a recently deceased child. I loved this book as a child and as an adult, I love it even more. It has a great Christmas message. We recently had a death in our extended family of a young child and this book was very comforting to me and her parents. From reading other reviews, I can see that this is not always the case for others. I hope you are able to read and enjoy this."
5,What an awesome story!,"I had this book as a child and loved it and now as an adult, I get even more from it reading it to my child. However, I must admit that that $10 word thing is a little over a three-year-old's head, but being a writer, I just rewrite it as I go along so he can understand the story too. The ending is just wonderful - how God chooses the Littlest Angel's gift over all the other angel's gifts to be presented to the Christ Child. Then, God turns it into the Star of Bethelehem! Pretty awesome and gives you goosebumps every single time. The jist of the story is to offer whatever you have to the Christ Child, no matter how poor it may seem or out of place to others, give of yourself. It's the same story as The Little Drummer Boy - he gave what he had, his gift of music. Great book for the holidays but be sure you read it first yourself before reading it to a younger child."
1,"Saddest book, NOT for children","A 4 year old in Heaven crying for his Mama? Other angels that scorn him for being what he is, a messy little boy? Horrible. My mama heart broke reading about that poor little one all alone. My copy went in the trash. I am glad that the Heaven I believe in is not like this."
3,Disappointed,"I READ THE 1980 version of the book every day to my daughter. I cannot find the original book I bought for her. I ordered the latest version, and am so disappointed. The illustrations are horrible. This is my daughter's all time favorite childrens books, and I wanted to buy her one for her child someday. She still can remember the little boy on the cloud after all these years. I only wish they could come out with a version like the book from the 1980's. I wish I could find her original. This version is so adult like and the illustrations are not conforting at all. This story is a true treasure!!!"
3,littlest angel,The prose was the same that I remembered from my chilhood but the illustrations were different and therefore of course a disappointment.
2,Disappointed with size,"I was disappointed in the size of the book. There was no indication that the book was smaller than what is in the stores. Dimensions for the book would have been very helpful. Also, there was no dust jacket, also not noted in the details of the book. I had to go to our local store and buy a copy that would be appropriate for a Christmas gift."
5,wonderful christmas book,"Our family has been reading this story on christmas eve for many years as a family tradition. Even though this is a work of fiction, it is beautiful and brings tears to my eyes every time I read it. My oldest son is away for Christmas this year. This story is his favorite. I ordered it for him so he could still carry on the tradition for Christmas this year. It was in perfect condition and sent quickly. This story is a true gem and will become a tradition for your family too!"
2,Artwork ruins a beautiful classic,"I loved this book as a child, and I was excited to find it still in print so that I can share it with my children. The story is an enjoyable classic; however, the illustrations are bizarre and unappealing. Some pictures that show just the little boy's face are sweet. Unfortunately, heaven is rendered in a dark, cold, abstract way that is reminiscent of outer space. Save your money--skip this copy in favor of one of the classic versions."
4,Littlest Angel,I bought this classic as a Christmas gift. It looks beautiful and is sure to be treasured.
4,FileMaker Pro 6,Excellent book and well written. As reference book it is one of the best. For a beginner you may need a more detailed one but this one go to the right information.
4,A place to learn about meditation and yourself.,"In this tape Rodney Yee Takes you through an easy to follow set of poses That Quiets the mind and body. This video will help you to acheive the inner stillness we all look for.Rodney Yee is by far my favorite of the Living Arts Instructors. He has great ability,clear instruction, a soothing voice,and kind eyes.All his videos seem to move right along so it will keep your interest. The only problem with this tape is that it should have ended with a few min. of music so you can stay in the stillness if you like. Instead it Goes right into a commercial for the Yoga Journal Series. Otherwise this tape gives you the foundation to begin a meditation practice. However You will want a book to go beyond the tape."
3,Just The Very Basics,"This video was nice, relaxing, and a little helpful. If I didn't have any prvious experince with meditation I would have not known how to continue beyond the instruction given in the video. It's a good tape to add to a collection and program that you already have in place, but not to stand alone."
3,It's a bit short.,"I don't like how short these are and how they skip from one to the other without you touching anything. I'd just be getting into a relaxed state, and then have to reach over and stop the video from progressing. Not a big fan. The scenery in the videos is pretty nice, though."
3,Meditation with lots of talking,"I was looking for a product that would be a good introduction to yoga, and stress-relief/meditation are always a bonus. This is a good guide to meditation, except that he keeps talking. It would probably work well if you use the techniques to your own music or with the mute button. This product did not do a lot for me, physically. I am fairly active and was looking for a way to do some stretching and refreshing yoga. This is not the right DVD. Good if you want to meditate, but don't buy it if you are looking for physical rather than mental refreshment."
4,boots,"The s-mx boots were great. It's my first pair of boots. I plan on using for track days. I have been wearing on the street. The bottoms have a solid feel on the pegs. They have great support. The weight is ok. The inside strings give a great snug fit. Visit youtube to see different models. The zipper takes some getting use to. I wear size 11 US. I ordered a 47 which equates to 12 US. Before ordering, check multiple places. I did not like the time it took to receive the order."
3,Redundant Rant,"I am reading books that offer alternatives to AA because AA and 12-step based therapy didn't work for me, for many of the reasons the author talks about in this book. However, I'm finding that the entire book is a long, redundant rant about AA and the ""recovery industry"", without offering much sound advice for someone looking for alternatives. Even the sections that talk about other ways to overcome addiction repeatedly fall back on ""what's wrong with AA"" to make a point. After a while you get the feeling that being anti-AA is the heart and soul of this book, not helping addicts. That's a fine subject for a book, but this one doesn't deliver on the other half of its title -- offering an ""empowering alternative."""
2,wading through the anti 12 step,"I was looking for an alternative to 12 step for my counseling clients and it seems that at least half the book was about what was wrong with 12 step and it was hard to get to the actual treatment. I learned more about 12 step than I really cared to just trying to wade through it to get the alternative. I do agree that 12 step is not for everyone and I know many people who want to drink more if they have to attend aa meetings, partly because that is all they talk about (drinking)"
5,"The Road to Independence, was long and difficult.","For the first time in the History of man, men devised a form of government that allowed men to govern themselves. This Great Experiment was unique in design and inception. It was not something that happened over night. It was a long and difficult struggle to convince the people that they no longer need ""royalty"" or Emperors to tell them how to live, that man can and should be able to live free and prosper. No other nation in history has done more for the World than these United States of America. Learn the truth behind the struggle."
5,Excellent,A great way to teach my three young sons the history of this great nation!! They loved the animation and I loved that they were learning something. This is a movie they can definitely watch over and over again. A++ Highly Recommended.
4,Not what I expected,This was very informative for myself and entertaining for my 3 year old daughter. Not a bad history movie. I really wished more of the founding fathers were covered.
5,A Must See,"Mike Church has once again hit the nail right on the head, I wish more people would see this film, and his others. It would solve a great deal of our problems."
5,Great Movie,"Best Fathers day gift I've ever recieved. When the movie ended I was disappointed,I didn't want it to end. My 8 and 10 year old daughters watched it together and they asked so many questions I missed some things. Have watched it 3 times now and will watch it again this weekend. Thank you Mr. Church an educational masterpiece."
4,"Great Story, Great Acting/Voiceover, Laughable Animation","Church does an excellent portrayal of the events leading up to the Declaration of Independence in his work Road to Independence. The acting, voices and voiceovers are great and I think this could easily be made into CDs. On the downside, the animation is downright laughable and I think many people will have a hard time watching the movie because of it. If you can see beyond the animation, it is really a wonderfully, historically accurate film."
3,"Good content, but...","I would give the content 5 stars and the animation 1 star. The animation is so bad it's distracting. At our little viewing party of seven, the animation drew more laughs than not, especially from the teenagers. At $30 it is expensive for a DVD and I do expect to be entertained a bit for my dollar, but, it is educational and gives the straight story of our founding."
2,Impossible but entertaining,"I found this book to be very entertaining and couldn't put it down, but it is very far from a good piece of literature. I found it very unbelievable that a man like Colin would put up with as much as he did. At some point you just think he's just as dimwitted as the rest of them, which caused me to stop really caring about any of the characters."
4,Compelling,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, at times staying up way into the night. I liked the interesting format of the story, shifting between Colin's directorial eye and the plot itself. The only problem I had is that at times it was a little too unbelievable. First that Colin would be so willing to to put up with the trials of being with Gina and second that Gina would be willing to put up with the trials of being in America.Overall, it was a compelling story, and a refreshing change of pace. Read a few pages into the first chapter, and you won't want to stop."
4,"""A fork In The Road""",Well written entertaining novel ( especially to those of Irish extraction).High on the list of books you won't want to put down until the last page is read.Explodes some of the myths of the old Irish culture and adds a glimpse of a slice of a modern day sub-culture.
4,Very entertaining,"Thoroughly enjoyable novel! The characters are very well developed even if the situations they find themselves in stretch the boundaries of reality - but isn't that why we read novels.As an Irish woman, I can say that the language and slang used are very true to form. I could hear the Irish Traveller accents clearly in my head. Those of you who thought the bad language was overboard have obviously never spent any time in inner city Dublin. This is genuinely how many talk.It is nice to see an American writing about Ireland without the pathos and Oirishness we so often see!"
4,Irish love story,"This novel begins as a light, amusing love story but picks up momentum in the latter half of the novel when reality sets in. The young Irish gypsy is wonderfully written and the language, though coarse, is colorful and quite typical of the expressions and accents of my Irish friends. The author has done considerable research into the Irish traveller community and provides us with real insights into this impoverished, marginalized people. I cared deeply for both characters in the end, tearing through the last 100 pages to learn their fate."
3,They are ok...,A whole box is way to much and they lasted longer than my low carb diet. I only ate half a bar a day because sometimes I felt weird after eating it. Maybe a side effect to the sweetener. So be careful.
1,WARNING AMAZOM.COM IS A FRAUD,"WARNING: DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON. They are frauds. They allow third party vendors to sell under their title, when that third party vendor does NOT have the product. On January 18,2008 when I inquired as to the when an item was to be sent by a third party vendor ""Gizmosforlife"", I was told by the Amazon rep. that Gizmos had informed Amazon that the item was out of stock, and had canceled my order; this was done without my being informed by Gizmos or Amazon.Yet on January 19, 2008 Amazon still listed the same item, by the same vendor which indicated it was in stock. An obvious fraud, since several days previously Gizmos had informed Amazon they were out of stock.Clearly to advertise products known to be out of stock are attempts to keep the public from looking elsewhere. This is a warning to let you lnow not to be taken in."
1,Disgusted!,"Bought two of these. One for work, one for home use. Barely used the one for home, it lasted 4 months, one month out of warranty. I had better luck with the other, it last 8 months until one day I plugged it in the usb port, light turn red and nothing.I guess I could use them for Christmas tree ornaments.NOT Recommend!"
4,Big Block Performance and Size,"Outstanding value considering HDD capacity and USB 2.0 technology. This device may cover adjacent USB ports on your PC. No reliability/durability info yet. Bought 2 for the office, and both are working great. Had purchased a 512 Mb JetFlash brand USB drive for $190 only a few months ago, though dimensions are smaller."
1,Obviously planned obsolescence,"After the drive stopped being detected by any computer I was looking on the internet to see if there was some kind of fix for my device. I found these reviews and even though I don't usually put my opinion out there I felt compelled to register my exeperience as additional validation. Anybody telling you this product is worth buying is selling them. Anybody telling you that it's crap is telling the truth.Oh yeah-don't try calling their tech department. After being on hold on voice mail for 15 minutes you will finally get a recording telling that they have unusually high call volume and ask you to leave your name and number so they can get back to you. And then you get their voice mail box, which will tell you that it's full and you need to call another number. That ought to tell you something about the way Digitalway's business is run: Caveat Emptor."
3,great while it worked,"I use this to back up important data between offices. It was great when it worked, except that as another reviewer said you can not get it into the UBS ports. I had to buy extension cables for each computer I used it on.Now it is dead. Quite boring. I guess it can be expected all electronics will evenusally give up, but you should not have to back up your back up devise. Sorry, wont buy again. There are smaller flash medias avaiable, I will try those."
1,Worked for 8 months,"I got mine on the clearance rack of Best Buy for only 70 dollars, so I feel a little better that I was not taken for the full price. I used it to take files between my home computer and work computer. One day, while at home, the little bugger had problems where the computer didn't even know it was there. I plugged in another flash drive in the same usb port to determine that it was not the port - worked fine. Took it to work - could not get it to open. Got stuck on hold for over 45 minutes before I gave up. Just going to chuck it and get something smaller that I don't have to have a cable to use."
1,Three months and a cloud of dust,"My Digitalway HS100 was great for 3 months, then went belly up! Beware."
4,Great hard bop and a fun listen,"""Jazz shakes off the dust of every-day life.""-Art BlakeyBlakey's Jazz Messengers are heard on this double live set from NYC's Birdland in 1960, recorded by the master Ruby Van Gelder. With a stellar line up including Lee Morgan and Wayne Shorter, the music cooks. And with new remastering by Van Gelder, any questions I had about sound quality were immediately answered.Blakey is the solid foundation of course, expertly guiding these jams through a mosaic of timbres and textures. The introductions by Pee Wee Marquette are fun to listen to and place the listener right in the jazz club atmosphere. I spent days listening to both discs on shuffle-play, so unfortunately I cannot comment on any specific track-I was never sure which one I was listening to! I just know that the music is great and the live setting is fun and I enjoyed everything I heard."
4,Blakey is the best,I have the Japanese import 24 bit remaster by Gelder and I discarded disc 1 but kept disc 2.I also have the other Jazz Corner double disc which I discarded disc 2 but kept disc 1.By combining the remaining two discs I have a custom set of performances from both gigs. I rule.
2,1001 adventure,"The books starts very lively and promises a lot but unfortunately, after the n-th adventure one already knows what is going to happen to the hero in the next 100 pages. There is no development of the character and the attempts at humor are rather ponderous. After page 150, I started skipping and finally went to the end of it - it was exactly what I expected. Could not finish it - definitely not what I expected."
3,Unsure,"I was quite ambivalent about this book. At first I decided to judge it by its cover, but upon reading it was tempted to instead judge it by its merits. Either way, the score was pretty much the same - so by the end I was still undecided. Not a dull book, exactly - but then, its not exactly anything."
4,Pretty Good,A catcher is an important part in baseball. The glove is the most important piece of the catcher and it requires a good glove much like this one. It has a lot of padding and is very comfotable.
2,Lint!?,This rather expensive product leaves white lint wherever it's used. Go over a black tablet computer with one and you'll never do it again. Heartily NOT recommended.
1,Bah,"This things instead of cleaning, leaves a lost of lint everywhere, I had 2 packages of this stuff, Im willing to throw'em to the garbage!!"
1,It's really not very good,"This book is really not as good as the 4 or 5 positive reviews would have you believe. It is overly simplistic and provides no information that any MBA couldn't have thought up in 5 minutes.There are two major sections to Beatty's book. 1: How businesses think ""today"" (really, 1996) and 2: Basics (and I mean basic) on the executive job search. The first part is pretty useless because as an MBA, you should have your own thoughts and opinions on today's businesses. This book provides nothing worth spending money for. The second part is okay if you know nothing about executive job searching but is much better served by John Lucht's ""Rites of Passage"".For real insights on Executive career movement, John Lucht's ""Rites of Passage"" is a must read. In the last week, I have read both books (I'm currently leaving a Big 3 consultancy) and Lucht's book was infinitely more valuable.Good luck."
5,Everything need to know in one book,Really impressed by research but most importantly it was right. Fundamentally changed how I approach my career and work - and it has benefited me greatly.A must have. How great it is to have the facts from the people in the know.
4,It immediately discredits itself,"In the first chapter or it may even be in the Preface, it says all the books available, if they are more than 5 years old, they are outdated. Its copywright is 1996, since then we have seen the New Economy Boom and now we are in the midst of a New Economy Crash(maybe). Right now, jobs are not as easy to come by, anyway.I would have to say that so far its content is readily applicable, still. Although, we are not quite halfway through it."
1,You Won't Learn Anything Useful ...,"... from this ridiculous travelogue. The photography is mediocre, there's scarcely any narrative quality to the pictures, the music isn't correlated to the scenes in any interesting manner and no effort has gone into selecting music by Sicilian composers or with Sicilian allusions. The editing is sloppy. The whole thing is a joke, and since I made the error of ordering it, the joke is on me."
2,Do not seek to change the Course,"I understand why Course students read these kind of books: ACIM can be quite confusing. Jesus, in his Course, advises students NOT to change the Course, but the ego will have its way, thus a mountain of these types of books in the marketplace. If you are a confused ACIM student, go buy Kenneth Wapnick's books and tapes. You will STILL have to put in effort, he offers no shortcuts (the Course IS a shortcut) but your confusion will subside and you too will make real progress as a student."
5,"Daily Meditations ""The Course""","Wonderful daily meditations that lend themselves to daily living. It has the same lovely balanced approach that ""The Course In Miracles"" offers up.This will add another dimension of balance to daily living."
4,Good for daily reminders,"This beautiful book nicely encapsulates concepts from the Course for daily reflection. I find it useful as a bridge between the very conceptual Course ideas and ""practical"" daily living. I do wish the meditations were a little longer, and I sometimes found the reflections on the day's idea inadequate. I suppose those things encourage the reader to truly meditate to find one's own meaning, however. Nonetheless, I personally find the Unity Daily Word magazine more fulfilling as a daily meditation aid."
4,Liked this book.,I liked this book pretty good. I especially liked the parts where David wrote in his journal and gave his account of what was going on. The characters were well defined. This writer was able to keep my attention and want to figure out what was going on....that kept the pages turning. I would recommend this to a friend.
5,I love this album,What a great set of music - very peaceful and relaxing. Somehow thought-provoking even though there are no lyrics in any of the songs.
2,Totally nonsensical,"This book occasionally exhibits beautiful, poetic writing, but it has no plot. It's impossible to tell what's happening at any point. The writing, despite the beautiful images, is thoroughly opaque and nonsensical. It's sort of about a man during the Civil War who goes back to a plantation where he once worked as a scribe to see if his promiscuous, mysterious ex-mistress is still there -- I think. I *think* he's remembering all this while he's on his way to a Northern prison camp. It's really pretty hard to tell. I don't recommend this."
1,Did not like,"I bought this CD for one song, Nothing Going to Stop us Now, and was hoping I would like others they sing, the only other one I liked was Sara."
2,"Selection A+, Sound Quality C- you can do better","The Good: The songs I want are all here - in that respect it's a great value.The Bad: Sound quality - There's something thin and grating about the sound. Like what early un-remastered CDs are renowed for: harsh treble, ear fatigue.I * love* the actual music. I guess I'm going to have to rebuy album by album the songs I want that have been remastered. I have some high quality cassettes that sound (techically) less ear fatiguing than this.My only solution so far is to turn the treble down. (If you have an equalizer, the 4Khz range...drop it back 4 to 6 db).I don't have to do this with my other albums and I have a * large * record collection.P.S. Don't get me wrong, I do not have ""golden ears"" and my stereo - while presentable is modest - not some mega audiophile system."
4,Good Anthology of Starship Music,Have been looking for a good collection of this band's great music. The went through many changes (and names) over their long history. But many of my favorites are on this CD. Good value for some great music from Starship.
4,Cute but not an heirloom,For the money I got what I expected although I did think it would be a bit larger. (I often don't really make a note of the dimensions so that's my bad). I took it out and played with it and it does what it should. I can't say its a super quality product but for the money I am satisfied. My 5- year old will enjoy this although I do not see more than 15-20 minutes of play at any one time.
4,"Classic, fun toy","I love this because it isn't electronic! Both of our kids enjoy it (1 & 4). It is extremely tough too, which surprised me. Our 1 yo has thrown it hard and it survived no problem. It is simple, classic, and great for everyday use, road trips, etc. The size is nice too. It is probably about 4X8, so easy for small hands."
3,Good but should double check his facts,"Randolph Lewis'book is interesting and provides a much needed look at Alanis Obomsawin's rich and inspiring career. However, Mr. Lewis should be more diligent when it comes to double-checking his facts. He mentions the Oka Crisis as a moment of great importance in Canada's recent history as well as in Alanis Obomsawin's journey as an activist and documentary filmmaker. However, he places the crisis in 1991 when, in reality, it took place in 1990. Lewis is sloppy on other occasions throughout the book which greatly reduced the pleasure I took in reading the book."
3,An okay starting point for those with no outdoor experience,"This DVD offers a number of good tips, but the presentation is a bit lame. The approach of the female presenter reminds me of a first grade teacher and the man looks as if he was dressed by someone from a 1930s Hollywood studio. Even so, there is some good basic information to be had. It would be a good starting point for someone who has no outdoor experience and intends to do further study, but those with even a modest level of hiking/camping experience will want to look elsewhere. For those needing something more, the DVDs from Ron Hood are an excellent place to find well presented, useful survival information."
1,Not quite the thing,"The problem with this was that it wasn't able to catch the viewer's attention...the presentation was a bit too hokey and caused me to constantly pause and go get a tea, make a sandwich, etcetera. The basic information is in it, but I do not feel the viewer will seriously digest the information. I cannot recommend this DVD at the market price.Anyone can make a video, but the presentation is the key. I feel that anyone, beginner to professional, will learn more from Ron Hood's Survival BasicsSurvival Basics 1 & 2for a lower price."
2,The assistant is terrible,"This was an informative video that educated me to some degree.But 1 HUGE PROBLEM with it: A big distraction named Laura Zealand, she's EXTREMELY annoying in this video! I can't stress this enough.Here's somethings that i'd rather do than to hear her voice or see her completely ridiculous acting:hear chalkboard scratching for the rest of my lifego to an ABBA concertLive through another presidential term by George W. BushDrown at seaBurn aliveGo deaf and blindEat fecal matterget run over by a tractor trailerDebate on abortionLive with roachesHave an illegitimate child with a prostituteDo you see where I am going with this?This video would have been great without her, or just let her play dumb and act like she's being taught something. But every time she opens her mouth it makes me cringe.Please tell me she didn't get paid well for this, uggghhhhh/rant"
1,Do not buy this product,This product arrived at my house damaged and used. It was dirty and broken. THE BOX HAD SO MUCH TAPE ON IT; IT WAS HARD TO SEE WHAT THE ITEM WAS.. MY SON GOT ALL A's ON HIS REPORT CARD AND THIS WAS A GIFT FOR HIM. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THIS WAS SOMETHING MY SON REALLY WANTED
3,Too small. Photo is deceptive,This item is smaller than the ad depicts so a scam. You might fit 3 stove size logs in the carrier.
3,"Useful, but plain fabric might have been better","This has flimsy made weave with inside coating, it works, but so thin, it is obvious it won't likely last though the winter. I might just make my own out of heavy duty gore tex or denim and just keep the stand. If you don't use the carrier that often will probably be fine. Other than the flimsy weave, it is convenient for getting wood and bringing it inside rather easily."
5,Great little tote and rack,"This is a great tote and log rack - perfect for the nights stack of logs. Holds 7 to 10 logs cut 22"" to 24"" inches long. The handy removeable tote makes trips to the wood wagon a breeze. I got this to use with my parents wood stove and it has worked out wonderful. If you can't or don't want to keep a large stack of wood in the house this is a handy and useful item."
2,Missing parts,The product is what I expected wi the exception that it shipped without the two dowel rods that give strength and shape to the ends of the canvas. Waste of my money without buying my own dowel rods...
2,Poor quality,Smaller than I thought and not as strong. Riped the first time I used it. Should have a stronger material.
3,good company,"I ordered this product but it was not what I had really wanted. The description said that it would not touch the floor, but it did. The company was great. I told them that I did not like the product becuase it touched the floor. They were very helpful in my return. I would definetly order from them again becuase of their custormer service."
2,Not what I was expecting,It didn't appear to me that this product was a cheap metal frame with a canvas bag liner. It does not look like the photo.
2,It is not aesthetically pleasing,"I have been using this product for over a year now. The good is that it has survived. The bad is that it looks ugly and cheap. In the future, I think I'd rather pay a little more and get something that gets the job done and looks good enough to be on display near my fireplace."
2,Stand is useful... tote is useless cheap Chinese grade nylon,"Reviewer D. Ellis was right on this... The metal stand is 'almost' worth the cost, but the tote is utterly useless. Metal stand is strong and sturdy, but the tote is really cheap nylon and the handles on the tote were sewn in positions which didn't make sense in relation to the stand. When I set wood onto and carried it into the house I was genuinely concerned the nylon would tear through. That's how cheap and useless the tote is.I'll be keeping my tried and true old (decade old) canvas/leather carrier and just use the stand.If you don't have a good carrier already and are looking for a complete stand/carrier solution, don't buy this. I'm sure other's like Landmann have a better overall solution."
1,You get what's in the picture...NOT!,"This item looks substantial in the picture but in reality is cheap and flimsy. I sent ot back as soon as it cmae out of the box, don't waste your money on this one. It won't last..."
3,I expected better,The quality of the fabric is lower than expected- the seams are already showing signs of stress and I have only used it a couple of times.
2,Think Twice if.....,"OK, so here's the deal. Does it sit there and hold a firebox full of wood? Yes. Is the canvas bag hearty enough to hold wood while you carrry it? Yes. BUT....the problem I have is this: the tubular unit that holds the canvas bag is in 4 parts - the two sides that sit on the ground, and thetwo ""A"" frames that point upward to accomidate the canvas tote. the issue is this: the frame, no mattr how well you put it together, puch on it, bang it, pound it....it falls back into four pieces whenever you jostle it. I even brought out my hammer and tried to HAMMER the pieces together - the next time I grabbed for the canvas tote to haul wood, it crumpled to the floor. Now....I am an experienced handyman. I plumb, I wire, I frame, I build cabinets, wood floors, tile, paint....everything. So it's not as if I am stupid - this thing just will not stay in one piece. if you wanna glue it up with some PL200 - you're probably g2g (good to go). Barring that - it's frustrating......"
2,I was disappointed,"I gave this as a gift to my sister and I am very diappointed in it. It does not look anything like this picture once she got it set up. It doesn't hold the wood very well, she still has a huge mess on the floor under it. I would have done better if I had given her a cardboard box. Very disappointed."
2,It was a nice idea but too flimsy.,The tote looks good online but when it arrived it tore almost immediately. I returned next day and went with something else.
3,Funny but not the best of Bananas,This guy is funny and I enjoyed most of his show but at times he comes off a little bitter. The end of the show he gives his life story and that is worth the price you pay for this dvd. Overall I thought he was very funny.
2,Japanese Horror? Maybe.,"When I purchased this movie, I thought that it was going to be a great Japanese horror movie. It turned out to be just weird and a little creepy, not really scary and gory like I was hoping, but its definitely something I have never seen before."
1,What happened?!,I was a big fan of the commics. Read all three. I was excited when i heard there was a movie made from them!What i saw was a badly put together combination of some of the short horror stories from the comics. They didn't even bother to explain half of what went on. they just showed short scenes that made refrence to some of the creepiest drawn comics I personally have read.I was VERY dissapointed.
3,twisted,"i was a bit surprised with the amount of creepy stuff they put into this horror movie. with a few details that were off, i was almost impressed. this movie should be remade, as other japanese horror flicks have been, with a little larger budget and people who took a few acting lessons. the soundtrack for the mostpart needs to be redone. at times when creepy music should have been played, they chose cheery happy music which totally threw the intended mood off.this movie was very subliminal. they had spirals everywhere, in just about every scene you could possibly imagine. if the scene was slowed down on something that seemed unimportant, take a look around and you will see an uzumaki.overall, it was interesting. if you are into japanese horror, you probably already know what to expect. they have an unusual way of doing these movies, which makes them original and makes me curious."
4,Watch before reading?,"More of a psycholocial thriller, Junji Ito's comic book story about the spiral obession taking over a small town is filmed in a green toned undersaturated look. The film slowly draws you into a suspension of disbelief. The best/creepiest moments are small seconds-long images that other characters never seem to notice.If you haven't read the comics, watch the film. If you've seen it, go to the source material! Junji Ito's work is gorgeously creepy. This film can be greatly appreciated for the wonderful cinematography even if the aura of creepiness fails to scare you."
2,Chopped Off with a Knife,"I could not believe the ending to this DVD. The first 110 minutes were a fairly faithful adaptation of the first volume of the three volume Uzumaki manga series. The film explores the characters and begins the builup of creepiness. Then, the pace quickens. The slime-geeks are given short shrift. The effect of the mud on the heroine's father is unexplained. Then, the film just ends. There is no resolution of anything raised theretofore in the film. The part where her boyfriend yells ""It's got me"" is not in the manga. And then his face turns demonic as in some cheapo horror flick. And that's just it. A bunch of pictures of (I guess) the ""effects"" of the spiral on the townsfolk are paraded across the screen and nothing else. This totally ruined the film. It seems as if they intended to do a multi-part film with sequeals covering all three volumes of the manga because they covered most of the first one, but then ran out of money and just slapped the ending on as best they could."
3,Good book overall but lacks first 90 day strategy,"This is a good book oveall. It offers some valuable insightregarding being succesful in your new job. However, this book never mentions the 90 day probationary period. I beleive this is becoming more and more important in our competitive work force. A lot of the material is common sense. Like avoidingcomparing jobs too much.Still, it's a good book overall and I like the 12-step program."
2,Lacks depth,"This book has a 12 stage process. It gives ideas on what needs to be done - mostly common sense like ""make a good first impression"" or ""use interpersonal skills"" but it does not go on to elaborate or give examples. It lacks depth and because the steps are fairly common sense anyway, the book lacks quality and is really not that helpful. I would not recommend this book."
1,Eww.,"Some reviewers have commented that all this movie is is a bunch of sex scenes. Actually, I would love to watch a *sexy* movie with a bunch of sex scenes, but that isn't what this is. Lots of scenes are really gross, to me anyway. He puts a boiled egg inside her and she squeezes it out again, she clips off some of his, um, hair and eats it, he rapes an old lady...it's pretty grim and pointless. My husband and I saw this in a theater, and we walked out."
3,Not For Children,"I watch alot of Japanese movies. I had an open mind while watching this one. It is in a nut shell, a porno that treads on grotesque. There is alot of S&M, a pedophilla shot, rape of an elderly lady and non stop sex. It is a porno with a better than average story line that is NOT for the squemish. THIS IS NOT FOR CHILDREN OR ANYONE WHO IS SENSITIVE TO VIOLENCE."
2,A porn film with a plot,"This review is for the Criterion Collection of the film.In the Realm of the Senses, directed by Nagisa Oshima, is a film about a couple.The film was made in Japan, but heavily censored there due to the sexually explicit content. This is the most sexually explicit film ever released on DVD by the Criterion Collection and is on par with hard-core pornography.A majority of the film contains sexually explicit scenes, which make this more of a porn film, than an actual movie in my opinion. I had a hard time watching it due to this.The DVD contains some special features worth watching though, including a 1976 interview with the filmmakers, audio commentary by Tony Rayns, a new interview with lead actor Tatsuya Fuji, a theatrical trailer, and some deleted scenes."
3,In the Realm...,"This movie, based upon a real story from Japan in 1936, takes one on a trip to Obsession. Ms. Sada was totally taken with her employer (and for the most part, so was her employer!). I can understand why this movie would have been banned by some. But, this movie was based on a TRUE Story. It was said that as shocked as the Japanese Public was, there was actually public sympathy for Ms. Sada. Love and devotion must have been quite different in 1936, for what she did would get you some serious time in this country!! 3 stars."
4,"Not bad acting at all, Maddona was right for once...","There is defintely a movie here and not just about sex. It's about passion and needing over coming ones mind, and I'm sure we've all felt that way at one time, of course maybe it wasn't in Feutal Japan, but at some point. There's such a deep story here, and whenever the couple were away from each other I thought they would kill whoever was near them, because they needed each other so much. The Lead Actress shows her skills of what it's like being a sexaholic, and the Lead Actor shows how easily it is to be overcome by a woman. Anyone who rates this as a bad movie didn't actually think about the movie at all, and just counted the sex scenes (which there a lot of) but that's even sicker than watching for the sex scenes."
3,OBSESSIVE,"The film was probably made to shock people. The majority of the film focuses on sex and various sexual acts between two illicit lovers who basically stay together for days on end doing nothing but have sex and maybe eat (sometimes the two activities complement one another). It was made in the mid 70s, which will seem very shocking when you watch it today. It is very graphic and visual, making no apologies for the liberties it takes. The end is rather insane and shocking also although if you have watched the film and read all the subtitles you won't be particularly surprised."
3,NC-17-RATED HARDCORE PORN FOR ADULTS,"This movie is pretty good for all mature adults. However, it is not for squemish people. Some people may be offended by the explicit sex scenes and graphic nudity. I think any guy would want to have this one in their private collection. Definitely not for children though."
2,Not that good...to put it lightly,"Some eroticism, more of a soft-core porn movie but unlike most of those there is the plot. The problem is perhaps that some of that plot gets lost in the translation, and there is much about Sada that goes unsaid and you are left to guess.The movie wasn't overly graphic in terms of sex, in my opinion, but the non-sexual images and some of the story was quite freakish. Not worthy of the class people are putting it in on many of their 'most erotic movies' lists... or maybe it's just not a very good movie.Was looking for an artistic, erotic masterpiece...this was about as erotic as a clockwork orange, but nowhere that good. Some of the reviews here would have been more helpful--we wish we had read them, but I admit I didn't want to spoil the plot completely."
3,Don't try this at home,"The film is based on an actual event that took place in Osaka in post-war Japan. As shocking as the culmination of this erotic tale is, it is based on fact, not the writer's imagination. I'm not sure what Leonard Matlin means by ""pretentious."" It's only pretentious if you believe it unlikely."
5,A masterpiece in a glorious blu-ray,"Lots have been said about this movie...not much else to add. Only that, after 34 years it is even much more of a masterpiece than it used to be; not only it is not dated, it gets deeper and deeper as time passes, one gets older, lives, and understands...About this blu-ray edition: the transfer is simply glorious. Is it sharp, contrasted, beautiful, much more than in cinemas; there's just a couple of scratches, but they are barely noticeable. It has never look better, just beautiful. The extras are great as well, very interesting and revealing. Just open your mind, open your senses, open your soul."
4,Explicit art,"It was not, to be honest, one of the films in the world I have enjoyed the most. The Japanese fascination with pain is a bit odd to me.But it is well made, and it proved an important point: that the western idea that sex or nudity must not be shown in a serious film is just wrong. It only seems wrong to show nudity or sex when the film makers are trying at the same time *not* to do it. If it is a natural part of the film, there is no problem whatsoever.It is a pity that we can only see sex or nudity in porn films, for they are always attrociously bad."
3,Exotica,"Sensual Japanese period piece, made in the '70s, portraying in graphic realism a notorious incident occurring in the thirties which clearly challenged the existing sexual mores and sensibilities of the time. The film maker used the shocking event to justify a presentation of arousing cinemagraphic exotica unlike audiences neither in Japan nor the U.S. had ever witnessed previously in public film theaters. Critics may dispute just where artistic license crosses into outright pornography, but the sincerity and realism of the protagonists' performance remain provocative, refreshing, convincing. While the lovers' seemingly endless couplings become repetitive, tedious, perhaps unnecessary, the overall effect leaves an onlooker feeling as though he or she witnessed something special, a genuine real-life experience between an attractive young couple exquisitely caught up in the delightful exploration of their senses and strikingly transformed through mutual sexual gratification."
3,Good...but far too many sex scenes...,"I really enjoyed this one, but there were actually too many sex scenes. I was with it for the first few, but after awhile, I actually found myself fast forwarding through them to get to the meat and potatoes of the movie (which was very good!). The woman falls in love with a married man and becomes very ""territorial"". The man makes her a promise that Im sure he definantly wished he had never done. The promise is what leads you to the movie's insane ending. I didnt know what I was in for when I first rented it, and was amazed to realize that it sat on the shelves with all the other movies, and not somewhere in the ""back room"" of the video store. Still a interesting title."
2,In the realm of the misogynist Gutter,"First off-this movie isn't""sensual"" at all--unless you're into female abuse/degradation--not that the male lead doesn't get his share of abuse at the movies end. Basically, a rich guy ""F's"" like a jack rabbit--every female he can get his slimy hands on.One rather unbalanced woman decides she wants his attention to be hers alone--but of course he doesn't comply. Both leads are unlikeable--the sex is either very ""R"" or barely ""X""--take your pick--but it's pointless either way. The story is dull-even played at fast speed and reading the sub-titles--this movie moves too slowly to be interesting.I'm not offended by pornography--and by pornographic standards--this movie's sex isn't all that explicit--but it's also pretty darn boring--"
3,A missed opportunity...,"A stunning film that lives in the memory long after seeing it. A shame the original Japanese language track was not included, at least it's in widescreen. A five star film, a three star DVD."
5,Retired Richard,Interesting film about a different culture that Americans are accustomed to. Pleasing to the eye and tastefully done. The actors and actresses are to be commended for their performances.
4,"Erotic, but not for the squeamish","The principal actors are beautiful, and the eroticism is beautiful as well,but the passionate attachment and the violence it evokes will be repugnantto some viewers."
1,This MOVIE [is weak]!,"And not just the chick!I was expecting something a little bit more interesting, but I didn't realize that sex could bo sooooooooo boring! Gimme a break. This movie is just plain horrible. Boring boring and more boring. ARGH! Why did I punish myself with such madness? I have seen better erotic movies that were not as explicit like Judou with the incredible Gong Li. Watch out for the sex scene involving bolts of red silk! Fantastic!"
1,A Waste of Time,"If you want to watch something erotic, save your money and get something else.I find the self-righteousness and pretentiousness of Japanese cinema in general to be a bit of a joke, and this is no exception. There is nothing redeeming about this movie. The acting is.. well, what acting? The endless sex is non-sequential and torturous to watch. When the movie finally ends, it leaves you nauseated and engrossed, wondering to what you have just subjected yourself. Even a glance of the DVD cover may become unbearable. Instead of turning you on, this movie might turn you way off."
5,Work of Art in Double X,Not for the timid who blush at raw passion !!! I first saw the film in '77 at Detroit Institute of Art and still consider the film a masterpiece in the study of sensual pleasure without restraint.
3,CUT ABOVE THE REST?,"Now, come off it people!This IS A rather tedious and overlong excursion into the sensual obsessions of two mismatched lovers circa 1938ish or thereabout. There are the usual boring, very boring endless ""pillowing"" {the Shogun term?} and the endless, repetitive music........YES, it does boast THAT scene ala Bobbit, but somewhat ""con-sensual"" - he seems to agree [!], give or take a few excursions into auto-asphyxiation [the silk-scarf bit].A trifle too extreme for the Younger Crowd, but worth-while having on your shelf, next to the copy of ""Salo"", ""Last Tango in Paris"" and ""The Night Porter"".Oh, the things we do do for love........."
3,"All in Japanase, no subtitles???","WTH? I turn the subtitles on, but nothing??? And the whole thing is in Japanese. Very Disappointed. I'll try on a friend DVD Player and see if the subtitles come up. If not, it'll stay a 3-stars for me."
4,In the Realm of the Senseless,"This is no deep philosophical dissertation on the human condition. There is sex as an obsession between a man of wealth and a waitress/prostitute. The film may not be considered particularly sensuous or erotic, but portrays a man and a woman enslaved by their libido. Interesting is the backdrop of Japan with its old-school traditional mores and standards of acceptable behavior. The video quality over the previous Fox-Lorber standard DVD is much improved. The subtitles are clearer in the Blu-ray. This is clearly a movie that may have esoteric and cultural value. The Blu-ray movie through Amazon is the full un-edited version, not R-rated as Amazon indicates."
2,Complete disappointment,"I am a long-distance runner, so use yoga as a relaxation/stretching technique. I purchased this video with the hopes that it would provide an overall stretching workout, increasing my flexibility. INDEED, flexibility is the focus, however, it is for HIGHLY ADVANCED yoga enthusiasts only. The stretches were repetitive and the first video only focuses on BACKBENDS while the second only focuses on FORWARD BENDS. If you're looking for a comprehensive stretching video to relax you, THIS IS NOT THE ONE FOR YOU!"
1,I bend like this in my sleep!,"I watched the intro to this video on youtube, and it showed impressive stretches so I bought this video. It covers a short routine then front and back bends. These bends are so basic and do nothing for anyone with any bit of flexibility already.Although if you haven't stretched in a while this is a good video.If you are looking to get flexibility like a contortionist(like me) this video is not remotely worth your time."
3,Not for beginners,"I bought this video thinking it was for beginners. It was way beyond my capacity. I tried it a few times and gave up in frustration. There is no way I could come anywhere near doing these poses. Maybe a beginner who is unusually flexible would benefit from it. But if you find it somewhat of a challenge just to touch your toes, forget about this video."
4,Good to physically challenge your body.,"This video is good for people who want to have the flexibility of a 6 months old infant, the balance of an acrobat, and Samson's strength. But don't fret, once you finish doing the tape (of course, cheating here and there), you will feel wonderful. You will feel absolutely every part of your body. I only wish that the background was less distracting and more inspiring.Best of luck and enjoy the tape."
5,Buenisimo,"it is actually very good to have won this kit, and to replace parts and forget that noise so appalling that produced each time I had turned my truck"
1,Major disappointment,As a longtime fan of the Tragically Hip -- especially the first 10 years of their history -- I had hoped this album would prominently feature the guitar work of Rob Baker. I was sadly mistaken and re-gifted it to my brother-in-law. Perhaps he will enjoy it.
5,Works well,"So far, no complaints. I have been using this since we bought our new house because my PC's internal wireless isn't working and there was no phone line in the office area. Works like a charm, no complaints thus far."
5,Great,"Great wireless connection with this! Perfect for moving between computers, takes up no space and thankfully NO wires! Would recommend to anyone!"
2,drops connection,This does get wireless connection rather slow tho and will drop it randomly the wireless card on my computer failed so i got this and it kinda sucks wouldnt reccomend it
1,Don't buy Netgear Wg111 Wireless-G USB 2.0 Adapter,"Netgear Wireless-G USB 2.0 Adapter Wg111 isn't VISTA compatible. There is a software download to fix the compatiblity issues from Netgear but I didn't have much luck with it. It has a very high mortality rate! Mine died less than 60 days after install, a friend has replaced hers 3 times in the past 9 months.Spend a little more and get the G54 Wireless USB Adapter WG111. Easy to install, VISTA compatible and once installed keeps on working!!"
1,Does not work,"Could not get product to work after multiple tries on my XP system, downloads of software updates, reboots, turning off wireless devices, and moving things around. Returned it after struggling for a couple of hours and bought the Medialink - Wireless N USB Adapter - 802.11n - 150Mbps - 2.4ghz and it worked right away."
1,very poor reception/failed immediately,Item became very hot. Could only get connection when I was almost on top of the router. It than failed completely all within 1 day.
3,netgear,"Could be a great product. I don't know if it is, because it wasn't delievered soon enough, so I had to buy something else."
1,Total rubbish,"Update: It will now connect but only through a single usb slot on the front of my tower, exposing it to a lot of danger of being bumped/bent. I still have to connect through their annoying software which seems to disconnect me at will. At least I can get some feeling of justice using it to connect to amazon to post this review. :)This thing has been worthless from the get go. I first installed it and had difficulty connecting to a network...basically it wouldn't. I had to use netgear's software in order to connect each and every time instead of just using the network search (ridiculously time consuming). It only worked half the time. When I moved to another city and could use ethernet I was extraordinarily happy. Now I have moved back and the damn thing won't even connect. I try to load the software and it gives me an error noise but no warning or explanation. No matter how many times I reload it still does the same thing. Do not waste your money please."
1,Terrible item,"I tried to install this device on my desktop didn't have access to the internet and ran into issues from the start. First the software sent to me wasn't compatible with Windows 7. I had to download from a different computer via memory stick, then downloaded to the desktop which went pretty smooth. However once loaded the computer read the card and gave me options of choosing my network for which it didn't allow me access, so I uninstalled the software and re-installed now the computer doesn't acknowledge the card at all. I believe this card is defective and would like assistance in either getting a new card or returning this card for a refund. I am very upset by this."
4,Overall Another Good Product From Netgear,"the adapter is good, easy to set up, seems reliable, compact size, but tends to get really hot so when you arent online i recommend to unplug the adapter. thanks about it. hope this helps."
1,"Useless, useless piece of junk.","Nightmare, absoulute nightmare to set up on XP, very very flakeyoperation, just won't find the network on win98se. on win2000, locks the machine if left connected when booting, when it does work, writes a file ( RtacDbg.txt ) which eventually fills up all the space on the hard-drive! How this ever got to market is beyond me. Complete waste of money. Better punting on a cheap chinese knock-off from Ebay, could not be worse than this piece of junk. --DON'T BUY!!-- --DON'T BUY!!-- --DON'T BUY!!-- --DON'T BUY!!-- --DON'T BUY!!-- --DON'T BUY!!-- --DON'T BUY!!-- --DON'T BUY!!--"
4,Netgear wireless adapter,"I had no difficulties with this product. Installed easily, detected my network automatically, and has worked well for a month now."
2,Not easy setup if you want good connection,"This has a very easy setup if you are going for decent web surfing and chatting. It is horrible if you want to go for Skype, On-line gaming, or anything that requires continuous bandwidth. It is possible, but it takes a lot of tweaking and requires you to do research for hours for all the extra downloads for stable ""lag-spike free"" bandwidth.But it is ok if you want it just for websurfing."
1,Buyer Beware,"This adapter has a fatal flaw (IRQ conflict?), at least when used with a Dell running Windows XP service pack 2.My whole sytem crashes and the computer can't run for more than 1 minute before it happens again. The problem began with the display driver. After many uploaded patches and ""fixes,"" it just kept getting worse. Finally I uninstalled the whole thing and re-loaded the original display driver from disc. No dice. System still crashes. Computer is now officially out of commission until I can afford to hire a tech to fix it. Thanks, Netgear. Most expensive $40 piece of equipment I ever bought."
4,Great and it is still working,"Great Product. Note to all potential buyers: This adapter tends to be very hot at first and after awhile its normal. So dont be like ""OMG this adapter is sooo hot im going to bring this back to amazon blah.. blah.. blah.."" its normal u %#$@%$!T so observe first before you complain."
1,Not great as advertised,Bought this for my desktop inorder to avoid wires. The router was on the same floor as the desktop. The connection was very slow inspite of my network being a FIOS. The wireless adapter will never connect automatically unless I connect to some other network first and then disconnect that network and then connect to my home network. This product would have been great if it was manufactured and used in 1980s. Do not buy this product even if they sell it for a penny.
4,Netgear WG111US,"I'm using this with a Linksys WRT54G wireless router and so far it works, most of the time. I say most of the time because at least once a day it'll drop the wireless connection for a few seconds. It's not the WG111 because I've tried other USB Wireless-G adapters and those also dropped connection at least once a day. It must be my room."
5,Works perfect everytime!!!,"I am dealt with a lot of tech support issues on this product, and as long as your system meets the required specs, this thing is the tool for you. I get non-stop high signal no matter where i roam, cranks up everytime with no issues. Can't beat it with a stick if you ask me."
4,this one is very good to me,"a little problem when I install it,but after one day, it works with no reason.very stable, keeping connected.great for this price."
4,USB Adapter Review,"Nice unit, simple to install, no problems setting it up. Works better than an equivalent D-link unit I tried, i.e., seems to have slightly better range inside the house."
5,Works great.,I purchased three of these for employees at work and I was able to install them very quickly and they work exactly as stated. Good product.
4,Really good.,"There's only one flaw with this item and that's the fact that it's bulky. My Dell has 4 USB ports on the back and this wireless key is so bulky that it prevents you from using the USB port to the top or bottom of the key. SO you're wasting two spaces. However, it was friendly to use, the software is a bit cumbersome and unnecessary with some bells and whistles, but all in all I""m happy!"
2,not compatible with win 7 64 bit,"if you are running a win 7 64 bit with kaspersky, don't even try this adapter.there's a issue about this problem, you can check it on [...]"
2,Disconnect - Connect - Hope it works - Repeat,"I have been using this wireless adapter for a few months and at least once a week for some unexplained reason the internet signal gets lost and the quickest fix seems to be unplugging the adapter, waiting 2 seconds, and plugging it back in. I'm not technical enough to know if this fix means that there is a problem with the adapter itself or not. Assuming you can stay connected you will have to deal with a blinking bright blue light which my wife absolutely hates. I'd suggest looking for alternatives to this adapter - even though the price is right you might get as frustrated as I have dealing with connection issues."
3,Good Basic Book,"Like most books on chess openings, spends way too much time on Queen's Gambit compared to other more popular and powerful openings."
5,BEST FIRST OPENING BOOK,"If you have already read a comprehensive book to get your started on the basics of chess, you may well be interested in a variety of openings. You need to prepare an opening system to get get you going.I have looked at all of the opening books out there (own over 500 chess books) and in my humble opinion (well maybe I am somewhat experienced as a chess teacher and tournament player) feel that there is no better book that covers the ideas behind the different openings. Certainly, this is not a reference book to look up all of the critical variations. But, if you are anyone ages 8 to 108 and want a ""general assessment"" of what you will get into with each opening this book is perfect.[...]A neat aspect of this book is that is does an excellent job of explaining the ideas and has enough lines to make it a more than worthwhile purchase!"
5,One caveat and a little advice,"I love this book! I second all the favorable reviews and recommend it enthusiastically.Here's the caveat: it does not have an index of opening names. This can be confusing and frustrating if someone recommends an opening by name and you don't know the move order, but it's not too hard to look up the opening by name somewhere else. (This book does have a very good index of opening moves).Here's the advice: this book does not cover opening principles, like ""Control of the center"", etc. For that you need a good general book on chess, like ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Chess"", which I recommend."
1,Painful to listen to----I gave up,Gavin's songwriting days are over. Even high tech production couldn't help these poorly written songs. Don't make me listen to it again. OUCH!
2,For not...,"I was highly disappointed with the songs. Granted, Chemicals Between Us, Spacetravel, and 40 Miles From the Sun were alright, and being that I really like Bush's first two CDs, and my favorite songs are from them, like Cold Contagious...this lacked any stand out songs. Chemicals was their first single, but it wont be highly thought of and any following singles will fall even faster from the public eye, sadly. Surprisingly the new KoRn CD was more enjoyable. Sorry guys, it was as disappointing as the first hour and a half of Phantom Menace.(the dual was hella good), but I'm sorry, The Science of Things falls short."
3,Still no 16 stone,"yah yah, I'm stuck in the past....I loved 16 stone, but since radio killed them, it's been hard for me to love them that much again. I loved ""Swallowed"" off the last album, but I just can't like ""Chemicals between us"" nearly as much for several reasons...first of all, it's almost techno sounding...& they're supposed to be a rock band. 2nd of all, I heard it's about Gwen Stefani, & I can't stand her. There's still a few good tracks on here, but just still no measure up to their first one. So listen b4 buying."
3,Good at times ...,"I guess I like it better than the second one. Lyrics seem repetitive at times. But after several listenings, it's starting to grow on me. It just seems that there are several songs that are bordering great, but just lack that something extra. Prizefighter is currently my favorite (except for the Prizefighter part). Recommended to all Bush fans."
4,definitely worth hearing,"I read the reviews of Science of Things and was surprised at how negative they were, but I shouldn't have been. After all Bush has always been trashed by jealous ""experts"" who can't play a chord. So I am here to tell you to ignore what they say, and if you're a Bush fan you are probably accustomed to doing so. As their albums go this is better than Razorblade Suitcase, but still not up there with 16stone. ""Warm Machine"", ""Jesus Online"", ""Chemicals Between Us"", ""40 Miles from the Sun"", and especially ""Prizefighter"" are all among Bush's best songs. It's actually 4 1/2 stars."
3,"Good, but not wonderful !!!","I have liked bush from the minute I bought their debut album ""sixteen Stone"". But I must say that they have completely changed in many ways. Their hard rock/Alternative sound has completely changed into something that tries to be almost Industrial-like, just like the song ""The Chemicals Between Us"", even though it's a good tune, it's not exactly the works of ""sixteen Stone"". The only thing that saves this album is the fact that it's by far better than their previous album ""Razorblade Suitcase"", that album was atrocious. but this is not a terrible album, if your're a true fan of the band, then get the CD, if not, you're not missing much."
4,Chemicals Between Me and Gaven,This is my baby He really let it all out on this one His songs aren't too retouched on this album It's like their singing live at a bar or some- thing A bar couldn't play this cd though because it would create too many fights You gotta play it in your room real LOUD!
3,Eh,"Yeah, it was good, I guess, but if you want to hear what Bush really has to offer... The Science of Things... is not good. Sixteen Stone is and will remain the best Bush album."
4,Bush silence the critics.,"Opener ""warm machine"" is possibly the best song Bush have written to date. Posessing a strong vocal hook line, coupled to a great riff and an eerie sense of melody it shows a band expanding beyond their post-grunge roots. Sadly the rest of the album cannot keep up this high standard. ""English Fire"" and ""Mind Changer"" both lack any distinguishable melody, While ""Prizefighter"" and ""Disease of the dancing cats"" are little more than avarage grunge thrashings. Not that it's all bad though, first single ""Chemicals Between Us"" fuses a pseudo dance beat to stabbing guitars and an excellent chorus, making it a truly memorable pop song. Other highlight include the sublime ""letting the cables sleep"" and the moody ""Dead Meat"". All in all a strong album, let down by a few weak songs."
3,The problem with Bush is...,"...that their lyrics are not meaningful, for the most part. I know that the Nirvava-tribute band thing has something to do with that, undoubtedly. Still, their music is unique, and their guitarist is one of the more talented out there. The best song I think is ""Warm Machine"". The other good songs are ""Jesus Online"", ""The Disease of the Dancing Cats"", and ""Altered States"". The Dancing Cats thing is cool because it is psychedelic in some ways, and I like the part when the drums speed up. ""Letting the Cables Sleep"" was a song I didn't originally like, but it is a good song that will grow on you. ""The Chemicals Between Us"" is a song I also like, but is more techno and almost an overuse of sonics. The other songs I either don't like, or I tuned out because the lyrics did not compute in my mind. Although I don't have Razorblade Suitcase, they use effects more on this CD than any other, and it tones it down somewhat. Good effort."
2,No connection,"I've tried listening to this CD repeatedly and it just doesn't connect. The music doesn't engage me somehow. The lyrics don't connect and are usually meaningless. The big exception on this album (and its irony) is ""Chemicals Between Us"" - one of the best songs this band has done. Very poingant for our age and beautifully rendered. I just can't be bothered with the rest. Sixteen Stone is still their best. Why do so many bands make a brilliant first album then go downhill from there?"
1,how do I put this nicely?,"I think you people listening to Bush are the same people listening to Creed, Godsmack, etc...this is not real grunge, please, go get some Soundgarden or Alice In Chains."
5,Wonderful!,"You know just because a CD is overplayed doesn't mean it is bad. It is actually on the contrary a sign that it is highly requested and truly a work of art. I can pretty much guarantee that about 50% of the time I get into my car, I can find a station playing Bush. For fans this is great, for non-fans it may be a little annoying, but let me assure you, the songs off this album will be completely overplayed and for a good reason. It is an excellent album! Its wonderful to hear some new sounds come from them. Letting the Cables Sleep is like no other Bush song ever written and all the others are also very unique! For those of you that aren't fans, let me tell you, I didn't care for them myself until I saw them live and have since been a huge fan! You should try it!"
3,More like 21/2 stars,"I really wanted to like this album-I really did! Their first two were really great, but this one just seems to be lacking. What? I don't know. I bought this album for 'Warm Machine', 'Jesus Online', and '40 Miles From The Sun.' The only real great hits were 'The Chemicals Between Us' and 'Letting The Cables Sleep.' I would waste $20 on just 'Letting the Cables Sleep' any day."
3,Mostly vanilla,"Bushes '94 album Sixteen Stone was simpely amazing. In The Science of Things, Bush attempts to branch out without losing sight of what made their earlier music brilliant. In some cases, they succeeded, but as a whole the album doesn't have what made Sixteen stone so good. The tracks ""warm machine,"" ""the chemicals between us,"" and ""letting the cables sleep,"" are all wonderful tracks, retaining the ""old bush"" flavor while showing the evolution that their music has gone through. Unfortunately, just about all the rest of the tracks are pure vanilla. They might be pretty good the first couple of times listening to them, but they get old and predictable very, very quickly. Should you buy the CD? It's hard to say. If it's worth your money to buy a CD for three good songs, go for it. Otherwise, your money is better spent elsewhere (get sixteen stone if you don't already have it)."
2,"A few good songs, but...","Well, to start this review off I must say there are a few good songs on this album, tracks 1-3 are strong as are 5, 6, and 8. I also must say that Gavin Rossdale has the song-writing ability of a 7th grade dropout. Some of the lyrics are truly awful- ""all the fishermen and their families, all sickly crumbling cerebellum""- etc. If you buy the album expect a few of Bush's trademark guitar riffs, but not too many. There are too many filler songs on this album to warrant a better rating. ""English Fire"" may be one of the worst songs ever written."
3,it's alright,there are a few good songs on here but half of the cd's songs are pretty boring and plain.
5,Their best album yet,"I would have liked to point out a few good songs, but the truth is that every single song is great. Bush is not my fav' band, but yet I have to admit that this is one of those rare cd's that you can put in to your player and play it 'till the end. Every song is great! ( did I already say that?) Get it now!"
4,Well worth the money but it could'vw been better.,"After waiting ages since 'Razorblade Suitcase' i rushed out to buy this. Its definately more polished than the others but lacks the power of Razorblade, it also lacks a song of the calibre of 'Swallowed' but there is enough variety here to keep me listenening, but although its a good album i keep heading back to the last one."
5,a step forward for the band,"I think the science of things is an excellent step forward for the band, yet it came out in an era when pop(unfornutatly) rules the charts. The science of things combines styles from both studios releases which is something the band NEEDED to do. But Bush is either loved or hated.. It is well worth your money if your a grunge fan."
4,The Science Of Bush,"Pretty good album but I expected more out of them from the previous 2 albums! I still say that Razorblade Suitcase is still their best album, but this one still needs to be appreciated! My favorite song is neither the 3 supposedly-best songs on the album: ""The Chemicals Between Us"", ""Jesus Online"", or ""Letting The Cables Sleep"". The song that needs to be more appreciated is ""Warm Machine""! The great catchy-guitars and lyrics will keep it in your head for the rest of the day! Also, ""40 Miles From The Sun"" is great...I'd say it is the love song of the whole album! These 2 songs were played at Woodstock '99 along with ""The Chemicals Between Us"". All along this album is not bad at all!"
3,Good effort,"I am no grunge fan, and yet for some odd reason, i like ""chemicals between us"" very much. it's a good song with a totally awesome music video. other than that, bush is el stinko."
5,THIS IS GOOD STUFF!!!!!,"This is a great album.i can listen to it in any mood.It is so unique because it combines so many things,and instead of mixing together in one big blur,it sounds wonderful.I just wanna say that I think BusH is during a great job.They have managed to make every one of their albums a masterpiece.BUY THEM ALL!"
4,"It's Bush, and they are darn good at what they do: ROCK","Bush is finally back with their first new studio album since 1996. Yeah, they had ""Deconstructed"" back in 1997, but lets try to forget that and what bad things happened to so many good songs. It's been a long time coming, but I'd say it's been worth the wait. ""The Science Of Things"" may pick up right where ""Razorblade Suitcase"" left off, which would be a good thing. ""Razorblade Suitcase"" was far superior to ""Sixteen Stone,"" in my humble opinion, and is still better than ""The Science Of Things."" But ""The Science Of Things"" is still very strong, very rock, and very Bush. Thank you, Gavin, Nigel, David, and Robin for another heck-of-an-album. In my opinion, once again, it was worth the wait, with songs like ""The Chemicals Between Us,"" ""Warm Machine,"" ""Prizefighter,"" ""Altered States,"" and ""Mindchanger."" Not to mention every other song on the album. Not a single bad one in the bunch. Bravo and thank you. Can't wait for the tour."
4,Post Grunge Intact,"""The Science Of Things"" is a great disc when you are feeling angry...and who isn't these days! These choice cuts are brooding and mysterious and Gavin Rosedale's mood indicates he always means business. There isn't any big difference between the new disc and past albums, aside from maybe a bit more maturity in the lyrics. All the songs are hard driven and are great when your speeding down the interstate, unless you live in California! Definintely worth the purchase if you're a hard rocker at heart, Bush comes through again and again."
4,Bush -,"I like this disc quite a bit, it doesn't really break any new ground but its a very listenable cd with a few great songs, specifically ""letting the cables sleep"" which to me is just a great song, although I wish it was longer, but they say all good things must end, so I suffer. Other than that song and chemicals between us there really isn't anything else that stands out, I think its they're best cd to date and if you like bush you'll like this one, if you don't like bush I'd have to say you probably won't like this one much"
4,"Good album, but nothing like Sixteen Stone","If there was once hope of a pure rock album from Bush after ""Sixteen Stone,"" then that hope has been lost with the release of this album. That isn't a bad thing though. In ""The Science of Things,"" the songs have more of a techno feel to them. Also, songwriter Gavin Rossdale has proven himself as an original composer, as he strays away from cliche melodies and chord paterns. While fans may be distracted by the techno sounds that back up the guitar, Songs like ""Warm Machine"" should satisfy their need for powerful guitar. To sum it up, this is a good album, but it lacks the heavy guitar hooks that the first album had. Still worth the money."
1,The Awful Lyrics Between Us,This cd was a waste of plastic. It is the worse thing I have heard in my whole entire life. The music is very bad and Gavin's voice and his lyrics are pitiful. Gavin needs to quit Bush and take lessons from his girlfriend Gwen on how to sing and write good lyrics. I would give this CD zero stars if it would let me.
3,40 miles from anythin good,"The album starts off brilliantly, the first three songs are amazing but as the album goes on it gets worse and worse...."
1,Ugh..........,"Didn't grunge go out of style like five years ago? It was a whiny, amateurish style of music which never deserved to be popular in the first place. These Nirvana wanna-be's don't seem to realize that grunge died a well-deserved death, though. Have some good taste and pass over this dreck."
1,the science of unoriginality,The Science of things. How long did it take you guys to come up with that brilliant title? This Cd is so bland and lacking of anything worth describing.I'm sick of all these power pop (crud)wanna-be bands out there that don't have an original thought anywhere in there brains. Avoid this useless cd at all costs. You'll be better for it
3,Much improvement from Razorblade Suitcase,This one's MUCH better than their last effort... But IT! That's all I got to say...
2,Lacks the cohesiveness of the two previous studio efforts.,"This album is a poorly structured extension of Razorblade Suitcase. Although there are a few notables-Chemicals Between Us,40 Miles from the Sun, and Prizefighter, the rest of the album is essentially wasted. The guitar pieces lack the solid riffing of the first album and the dynamics of the second. Although Gavin's vocals are better than ever on this album, they do not overshadow the lack of songwriting."
5,This is what I've been waiting for,"""The Science of Things"" is an amazing album. I would have to say the strongest tracks are ""Warm Machine"" ""Altered States"" and ""Letting the Cables Sleep"". The band plays wonderfully and Gavin's voice has never sounded better. It has a great range of rockin songs to powerful ballads. I can't wait to get to know this album as deeply as ""Sixteen Stone"" and ""Razorblade Suitcase""."
3,"A good CD, but a bit disappointing for long-time Bush fans","The Science of Things is a good CD, no question. But when compared to Sixteen Stone... well, the long-time Bush fan feels a bit cheap. The band has taken a grossly techno/electronica turn, subdued only on tracks like Letting the Cables Sleep, the best song on the entire CD, where Rossdale's vocals and songwriting really shine (""Never seem to get in the place that I belong/Don't wanna lose the time, lose the time to come""). Pop fans will enjoy this CD a lot more than Bush fans who have been along for the ride since Sixteen Stone."
4,Deep CD,"I listened to it and I liked it. This is my first Bush CD and I'm glad that I got it. The Science of Things had a deep gutair edge and sound to it which you can hear in almost every song. Its also almost techno, too, with machine/michanical sounds. The lyrics are a little strange and hard to understand, but I'm sure they mean something in some way. I'd recomend it to anyone who has liked Bush before this album or anyone who got fixed on ""The Chemicals Between Us"", which is one of the many terrific songs on this awsome album!"
1,more of thesame filler,"i cant see how anyone can call this music, let alone innovative music. simply take a couple of greedy musicians, recycle old, used and empty ideas, and you get a dime-a-dozen band like bush."
2,Unhappy=-(,"I must say that after almost three years of waiting for my favorite band to put out a new album that was more than disappointed. I wonder why Bush is a band that thinks that they must change. There are a few songs on The Science of Things that seem more like those of the earlier two albums, but the majority of the CD seems experimental. If you love Bush for their hard songs and clever lyrics then pray that they release a single of The Chemicals Between Us because that is as good as it gets onthis album that would be a waste of your money."
3,This weak effort killed Bush.,"Other than ""The Chemicals Between Us"" and ""Warm Machine"" there is not another song on this cd that I remember. I was very disappointed, and I'm sure they were as a band too, because it failed miserably compared to their first two cds. Trying to incorporate electronica into grunge just didn't work for me.Could you see STP, AIC, Pearl Jam , or Soundgarden doing that? No way. This is their worst record, so I would not recommend it to anyone other than a diehard fan. And even they might be disappointed. Save for a couple of good hits, this was completely forgettable to me. I'm not saying it is a horrible record, but it doesn't stick....at all."
2,hey! this band sounds like.....,"The thing you guys are missing is the sheer unoriginality on this album. Still two stars for effort, one star is overused. The only album that deserves one star is ""devil without a cause"" (and that ""i wish i could give it zero stars"" is just stupid). If you like unoriginal bands that steal music from others, you'll like this. Have you heard the new Bush single, its called ""smells like teen spiroot""."
4,Feels like a Science Fiction Movie!,"This was an excellent album. The reasons others criticized ""The Science of Things"" is the reasons I love it. The techno influence was very innovative and creative in my opinion. It gave the music an atmospheric, science type vibe (which was the theme of their album). The music has a edgy, evil sound to it (it's great!). I guess I appreciated this aspect becuase I like Science fiction. The music reminds me of video games like Half-life and movies like the Matrix. Some of my favorite songs on the album are The Warm Machine, Jesus Online, Space Travel, Disease of the Dancing Cats, and of course Chemicals Between Us. I would have given the album 4 1/2 stars, but amazon is only allowing me to use whole numbers. Now I'm anxious to check out their first two albums...."
4,Listen before you buy,"Not a bad CD at all, although about four songs sound the same. Chemicals between us is indeed the best track on this CD, yet a few others aren't bad at all. Best advice is listen before you buy."
3,I like their older stuff better.,"Like before gavin dyed his hair red! i just don't really like their new sound. But i can say that i love the song ""the chemicals between us""!"
5,Bush has grown over the years,"Lemme say this first...WOW! Its an awesome album. Bush is learning to branch out onto different styles and genres of music. Adding stringed instuments and the piano has given their music a little more spice. This album is a great improvement from Razorblade Suitcase and Im glad they went back to their old producer. The most notable songs are Chemicals Between Us, 40 Miles from the Sun, Letting the Cables Sleep, MindChanger, and Prizefighter. I suggest anyone who has an interest in Bush's music, Past or Present, to buy the album"
2,This album is not good - and I wasn't expecting it to be...,"I had no high expectations for this album - so I wasn't really disappointed. ""The Chemicals Between Us"" is PATHETIC and I can't stand it. Their last album was the best - mostly because THE LYRICS MADE SENSE. On ""Sixteen Stone,"" words were just thrown together and melodies were just overlapped to take up time; However, ""Glycerine,"" whch of course - DOESN'T MAKE SENSE... is a great song. The others aren't good at all.This 'album' is still worse than that.None of the tracks are of high quality. I can't listen to songs over and over and their music has become simply annoying. AVOID."
2,Another Cookie Cutter Band With an Unoriginal Album,"This band sounds just like all the others heard on the radio. It's boring + gets dull after listening to the cd more than twice. I bought it with a gift certificate to a book store just because I heard the single, the science of things, now I wish I had spent it on a book--and I don't like books very much--"
2,VERY UPSET ABOUT THIS CD!,It seems every time Bush comes out with a CD the worse it gets! I can't believe what I heard. I was very upset that the only song worth listening to was The Chemicals Between Us. All the other ones were pretty bad. You will not like this CD.
1,The Science of Suckiness,"Dear reader, please choose one of the following to this question: What do you think about the band Bush?1 They suck2 They suck3 They suck4 They suck5 They suckOur reviewer apologizes for being unoriginal but he felt there was a need to parallel his lack of originality with Bush's lack of originality. He despises their arrogance and whiny self-loathing. He believes the songs are crude and miss the effectiveness of getting the meanings across. Instead what we have is a case of mistaken identity. Many clever music fans are mistaken into thinking that Bush are talented musicians.NOTE: Our reviewer apologizes for typing in the third person."
1,Pretty sh**ty,i got this cd cause my sister has an older one and it is good. this is c**p. whoever says this is good is full of bull. i got and i couldnt even listen all the way through. chemicals between us is the best song and its really really really really(you get the point) bad.
5,Anomalist Book Award 2002 -- Best Biography,"If Thomas Pynchon had any interest in Charles Fort, this is the kind of book that might result. It's far more than a biography (Damon Knight already did that), but a literary study of Fort the writer, as well as a postmodern rant on the illusory nature of facts and reality in the light of Fort's philosophy. Bennett, like Fort, sees ""explanations,"" especially those provided by science, as a superficial means of understanding. Even more than in his previous book, Looking for Orthon, Bennett does battle with modern skepticism, which he sees as a debilitating contemporary illness. This is a great, big, heady stew of a book full of references to literature, arts, philosophy and more-much, much more. Bennett takes Fort and runs for the goalposts--I don't think anyone else could have done him justice. This book is a monster, a raised fist at the orthodox prison of the mind that is contemporary culture."
1,PU,"I confess I bought this for 2 reasons, I treasure my copy of Damon Knight's proto-bio of Fort from the 70's, and wanting to see a contemporary re-examination of Fort's life & work; and the chance to read some new John Keel writing with the foreword. I had then 2 realizations, Damon Knight's bio still stands as the only legitimate bio on Fort (who is worthy of far better than this mishmash) and a paragraph by Keel is often more insightful than entire books by others. I'd read Bennett's ""Looking for Orthon"" and enjoyed it, an adept descriptive travelog of the saucer mania in the 1950's. But this alleged study of the life, work & ideas on Fort is a travesty. This book is more about Bennett's fortean awakening, his political education and his various axes he wishes to grind in public. All in all, it's more about the author and less about Fort. My conclusion- don't bother. Get Knight's book through inter-library loan or out of print book services."
5,Jack and Sarah,Its a great movie if you really like drama and real life. This kind of story happens in real life. Every year a mother dies giving birth and is not easy for a man that has never been a dad before to overcome this kind of situations.
4,Great Film,I just want to correct the previous reviewer - Richard E Grant is NOT Hugh Grant's brother - they just happen to share the same last name!About the film - fantastic romantic comedy + very very cute baby!
3,An entertaining guide to the use of.....,"This book has some good ideas about the use of urine for fertilizer - but there's a bit too much ""fluff"", and too many attempts to just get a laugh.A more serious tilt for the book would have been better, in my opinion."
3,not of real practical use,"This is more a booklet than a book. I would have expected to get some practical drawings or hints how to build a system. Like nearly everyone else in the ""civilized"" world we have got a flush toilet. A second toilet would be quite handy for us and for this reason we don't need a complicated urine separating system. I would have expected more hands on detail in the book. Otherwise it is an inspiring but quick and a bit superficial read."
5,This book is FUN!,"For anyone interested in this sort of thing ""Practicality"". This book is fun and interesting. I loved it. Very Easy read. Lots of techniques used around the world on urine separating toilents; along with ideas on how to create you own urinals. I acually made one after reading this book and am using it as liquid fertilizer in my yard. The design is so clean and out of the way that not even my wife was bothered by it!"
3,Hideous K-Y Jelly consistency,"Takes a long time for it to ""dry."" It feels just like KY Jelly. Very uncomfortable sensation on the skin. Would be so much better in a creme form."
3,Arginine Circulation gel,No noticable added benefits for faster stimulation with this product when compares to normal ky jelly.
1,product defective,"I received this product, although packaged well, product does not work. Not damaged in shipping, I feel that I was sent a product that did not work."
4,good:),i love ur cereal but all i eat is the oat clusters and the almonds whoever is in charge of this i think u should make a cereal with just almonds and oat clusters!i would absoulty love that it would make my day!!byereba gillispie
3,Do not buy!!!,"Initially I gave this product 3 stars, and unfortunately I can't take them back. I'd take away all 3 if I could. After a few months the wiring became exposed in 2 places: where it attaches to the mouse and the USB connect. After spending a couple weeks constantly adjusting the wire to get it to connect, it ended up in the trash. Very disappointing product."
1,mom from long island,***THIS IS AN AWFUL PRODUCT ***The mouse itself is encased in a linyl cover. It was a little difficult to get used to but worked well. The problem is in the wiring. The coating broke on both ends exposing the wire. The mouse stopped working in less then 2 months. I wish I saved the receipt to get my money back.
3,Feeling neutral,"I'm feeling kind of neutral about this JH book. On one hand, I enjoyed the humor and the bantering dialogue. I also liked the pace of the book. However, the lame ""mystery"" surrounding the mom's boyfriend dragged down the last third of the book and I couldn't wait to finish it. The farce at the end with Stacey disguised as an ex-wife of the mom's boyfriend was too over-the-top for my liking. Out of the three JH books I've read so far, including Female Intelligence and An Ex To Grind, I would recommend An Ex To Grind over the three. I like the author's voice overall so I will be trying one or two more of her novels and hopefully I won't be disappointed."
3,A Fun Romp in LA,"This book written by Jane Heller is passably entertaining. It reminds me of a made for T.V. romantic comedy. All of the elements that make a major motion picture are there, but whatever it is that makes you want to watch (or this case read) something over and over again are missing. Don't get me wrong, there are moments of genuine character developement and humor in the book, but the moments are too few and far between to sustain the story. The plot and the main mystery in the story oddly seems to be in the background. It is predicable with no real plot twists. The first person narration used in the novel is supposed to establish a rappaport bewteen the narrator and the reader fails at times. I felt irrated with the narrator many times, not enchanted. All in all this book is fun to read, but utterly forgettable."
3,A bit of a disappointment...,"Having read several of Heller's novels, I was looking forward to reading Lucky Stars. However, I found it to be a disappointment: the dialogue was contrived, the characters were flat, and the plot itself was slow. Heller describes her heroine, Stacey, as savvy, intelligent, and street-smart, but she is portrayed as completely the opposite. She is too quick to fall for whatever information she finds on the antagonist, Victor Chellus, and is even quicker to tattle-tale to her mother. Her romance with Jack Rawlins is completely unbelievable, given the fact that he is portrayed as a pompous jerk in the beginning--he fell for her too easily, and the whole thing comes off as entirely contrived. The book has its moments, but overall, it was a big disappointment. My advice? Save your money--not to mention your time--for something more enjoyable and worthwhile."
5,Excellent and unique suspenders,I was very pleased to find these well made and unique designed suspenders. They were shipped to me well packed and quickly!
5,Greatest Birthday Present!,I got this for a birthday present this year and was absolutely overjoyed when I saw what was in the packaging! Hurrah for friends knowing how to use amazon wishlists! I got the 42 long and fit me just perfectly! I'm 5'5 and female
5,Wonderful Class and Book,I actually had the opportunity to take Bill's class in LA and he 's wondreful and no nonsense...got to make this a read.
1,76 Minutes I'll Never Get Back,"This movie had so much promise. Banned in the UK, a quotation on the jacket stating ""Truly dangerous cinema,"" gritty style... and guess what? Horrid waste of time. The first 25 minutes were the best part of the movie and that is before the villain arrives. That's NOT to say that the first part of the movie is good... it's not... just letting you know that it does not get better as the movie plays on.The villain arrives and then, from what I can gather, he makes scary faces at the victim. The flashbacks gave me a headache and enough with the strobe lights already! No gore. No intelligible dialogue. No point in seeing."
1,BANNED IN THE UK,"This is banned in the uk and i know why.Not because it's subversive and misogynistic but because it's crap, in my opinion.Very repetitive."
4,"Funny, but not realistic","This fart whistle is entertaining, but the noises are not realistic. We spent a fair amount of time ""perfecting"" the sound with different angles and positions to try to get more realistic noises. It can be pretty hilarious though!"
2,Mediocre,My 6 yo daughter had fun with it before it fell apart. Plastic sleeve kept falling off which wasn't a big deal. Then the sleeve tore and it was useless. Lasted about a week to 10 days.
2,Fart Whistle,"I bought this for my daughter to put in her stocking. She's 16 and always a joking around. It didn't work at all. You have to have really, really strong lungs to even get the smallest noise from it. I was disappointed as the other reviews I read talked of how much fun it was. The one we received may have been defective I don't know and I didn't contact the buyer either. It was more of a gag gift, so I wasn't too worried."
3,fun toy,"My son enjoyed the toy when he first got it. Unfortunately, I think he lost it. It was fun while it lasted."
1,no good,"My daughter tried the whistle Christmas morning, it sounded more like a duck. If you want to hear fart sounds save your 2.00 go to the grocery store and buy a can of pork n beans."
1,a disappointment,"The postage was insufficient (44 cents) so to receive the whistle I had to pay $1.51 on top of my purchase price. The plastic tube had stress marks that it will break along. The rubber whistle part was cheaply made, stuck together, and I have been trying to pry it apart for half an hour now, concerned that I will puncture it and never hear the promised sound. I bought it for a classroom discussion on sound through vibration, but wonder if it will ever make a sound of any kind. I have used a paper clip, screw driver, and pencil to try to ease the rubber apart, but it appears melted shut in the center. It is a big disappointment."
1,Junk,Bought for nieces and nephews as stocking stuffer. Not a single one worked out of six. Unable to move any air through or item was damaged in package.
2,okay but not as good as expected.,"got this for my 6 year old niece. she likes it but it doesnt make a very good ""fart"" noise. when you first get it you have to stick your finger into the rubber whistle part and pry the rubber apart in the inside to let the air be able to flow through it. on the package it shows the whistle is cut on the sides, haven't tried this but it couldn't hurt im sure. would probably not ever buy this again. would find something else like a woopee cusion or flarp."
2,A Kids Review,"This toy was junk... I would not recommended it. The whistle's rubber was stuck together, and I had to stick a pencil through it to loosen it up. It got a small rip in the process, because it was like someone had glued it together. I blew into it,and if you put your hand around the end of it, it sounded kind of like a fart. It stopped working after about 5 blows.This product is cheep, so I am not surprised that is did not work...NOT recommended, spend your money on something else, you will be much happier :)"
2,"Sounds like a goose- 2 Days later, it's broken!","I think that the title speaks for itself. Fun idea for boys, but, does not last any time at all, and they all laughed because it sounds like a goose instead of... well what it is supposed to sound like. I would say, avoid."
1,"Doesn't work, broke, and not anything.","As soon as I got it, i tried it, it didnt work. So i tried to fix it. It broke. Worth 5 cents. SCAM."
2,Not a real fart noise,"Fart whistle is ok... but like people are saying it doesn't sound like a real fart at all. It took a while of finagling in order to get it to even make a vibrating sound. Sounds more like some kind of Dick Cheney duck whistle rather than your tooter tooting. Oh well. Shipping packaging etc., was all good and fine, but its just not realistic ass sounds. Kind of disfartening."
3,Fart whistle,I bought 5 of these and we opened 3 of them so far and 2 of them work wonderful but one of them doesn't work. We gave 2 away as gifts so I don't know how good they work. My kids loved them its just too bad one didn't work. Very quick delivery! Very nice company to buy from!
1,whistle,"the whistle did not work at all... is was a cute idea but I would not buy another product like this one. This does not mean I wouldn't buy from this company again, the company does not know it didn't work because I did not tell them... I am sure they would have replaced it."
1,Cheap as can be without delivering,"This ain't even close to a sound that would make anyone crack up. Get a balloon, blow up, and let the air escape. That is 10 times better.This product probably costs 10 cents to make with a plastic round tube and a piece of rubber tube. Should not have to pay more than $1.00 for it. The price asked would at least have some value if it worked as expected."
1,Useless,This whistle does not sound anything like a fart. It sounds like a kazoo. I wish I could give this product zero stars. A complete waste of money.
4,Great for little boys...,My nephew drove his parents crazy with this little fart-wonder whistle. I am now banned from buying any more Xmas gifts for the kids.
1,Didn't work,Bought 2 of these and they do not make a sound that resembles the real thing. Waste of money as my kids didn't like them.
2,THUMBS DOWN,NOTHING GOOD TO SAY ABOUT IT OTHER THAN THE PRICE. QUALITY WAS POOR AND IT SOUNDED MORE LIKE A BAD DUCK CALL.
1,It didn't sound like a Fart!,"It was a complete waste, it didn't proform as expected,a sounded nothing like a fart ! The kids tried it didn't amuse them at all!"
4,Fart whistle or sick-duck call,"It doesn't sound too much like a fart, not enough bass, but my grand-daughter has had a lot of fun with it annoying her parents and that's what it's all about."
1,Hate it,This thing is useless and doesn't work. !! Don't waste your money get a woopie cushion instead !! !! !!
1,NOT GOOD,I received my package and it is not what was pictured...it looks nothing like it and the packaging is not even close to the picture. Very disappointed!!
1,No Fun Here,"I'm sad to report that the poorly made fart whistle wouldn't be a deal in a dollar store. It's basically a bit of balloon at the end of a very thin, cheap bit of plastic. That would be fine if it worked; it does not. True it makes a sound when you blow in it but the sound is not even vaguely reminiscent of any fart I have ever heard.This products does not do what it claims. Avoid."
4,Good Read,"Levy uses good research in depicting one of baseball's most unique characters. The author stresses that to Rube Waddell, baseball needed to be only a game and not a life-or-death compulsion. In the book, we are taken back to a time when people viewed life much differently than they do today. Rube was a magnificent product of that time--flaws and all. A good read for anyone interested in early twentieth-century baseball.Charles BenderGeorge Town, Cayman Islands"
2,DISAPOINTED,"This disc is one of I beleive 6 in a series realeased earler this yr.I brought the live disc(5 star) from Amazon.After much consederation and listening several times too the new essensles collection( also 5 star{@ a local target})Both live and Ess Coll:Are extremely well (RE)masteres:Where as the R&B set is poorly re-mastered(picked up@boarders) by comparison.The main song on the R&b set I wanted was ""I got a Woman"".This track(along with the others)sounds worse then a almost 20yr old cassette(which also features mentioned title) I have.Because of the poor re-mastering of R&B ,I am not bothering with the other disc in this set.One plus for R&B - it features less popular songs,that are frequently featured on other cd."
5,"""Ramesses II"" not ""Rameses II""","In spite of misspelling the title of the book, Amazon.com makes available a large format publication that provides excellent viewing of fine photography and renderings. The details of wall reliefs and murals are rendered exquisitely and hilight otherwise missed opportunities to appreciate the finesse of ancient Egyptian artists. Mr. James' text is extremely readable and in writing the history of a notable king engages the reader in a variety of ways and maintains a high level of interest. A very worthwhile acquisition for anyone interested in ancient Egypt!"
2,Requires a cleanroom to install,"The product has good quality, but installing it is an exercise of frustration. I had a brand new, squeaky clean iPhone (peeled the original wrapping seconds before installing the Screen Protector) and still, got unremovable bubbles. The reason : even a minuscule grain of dust will create a ""princess and the pea"" effect, generate a very visible bubble when the screen is off. I can live with them when the screen is on.The borders of the protector tend to not adhere to the screen, no matter how much you insist, again generating a very visible bubble.It works as a protection, but it is not inconspicuously pretty as I expected."
1,Does not work on iPhone,"I should have listened to the person who posted the first review. This film does not adhere to the iPhone screen. Please don't even bother. I bought a BoxWave screen for my Motorola Droid and it was awesome. I've had it on my phone for over a year and you still can't even tell it's there. That's the way a screen protector should work. Also, I thought the fit wasn't very good either. It should be perfect, but had it actually stuck to the screen, I would have been disappointed with the fit. I am in the process of returning the item. I will look for a different company to buy an iPhone screen protection film."
1,disappointed,I bought this product for my new iphone after successfully installing one on my itouch a couple of years ago. What a disappointment. Would not stay on front or back of my iphone. Finally had to go out and buy a new brand which worked great. Never buy boxwave brand again.
3,okay i guess,I felt a scratchy throat so for the fist time started taking it. After 5 days getting better after going into a cold. It may be better than nothing but I didn't see or feel anything spectacular!
1,Misleading Merchant - advertises 16oz - sends you 8oz,"I found that I was not the only one taken in by the Misleading Merchant! He advertised 16oz for $16.81/$1.05 per oz & then sends you an 8oz bottle. He partially corrected his ad by placing 8oz after American Biotech Labs, however, he still states that the cost is $16.81/$1.05 per oz. Amazon's customer service is outstanding (I have returned the 8oz bottle). Amazon should remove this merchant from their services."
3,My thoughts,I found there is not enough information to tell customer what exactly this product does. What can I use it for? I saw it advertised on Benny Hinn Show and it seemed like a panacea for all problems. I have blepharitis and would like to know can I use this on the eyelids. Needs a lot more clarification for its uses.Pat Garraty
4,Silver Biotics,An easy to use spray bottle containing distilled waterand collodial silver. One or two sprays per day under thetongue kills viruses. I have been using the product for threemonths and have had no colds or flu in that time.
4,Great Product!!,This product has helped me with mouth cankers a lot. Instead 3 wks of misery it's just one. It alos helps with bad breath and gum disease.
1,Beware,"I ordered three bottles of silver biotics. The same day I received the product, ABC News presented a story dealing with side effects of silver biotics. I returned product (unopened) for a refund. My refund was broken down into two orders (2 bottles) and (1 bottle) in order to reduce the amount of my refund. I had ordered all three bottles in one package and returned them in the same box. But the seller charged me as if I had placed two orders so they could charge me shipping twice. This is a cheap trick that should not be allowed by Amazon."
5,Great for fighting the flu.,I take siver biotics every winter and so far I have gotten through winters with very mild colds and no flu. The price I paid at Amazon is by far a much better deal than you can get anywhere else.
2,not happy with product,"I have been on this silver now for 23 days. I was on it for a UTI. I took it with antibiotcs , after getting off the antibiotics, 6 days, and still taking the silver, I went to the Dr's and the infection is back. I took 3 teaspoons a day. It is possible silver will take longer to kick in. But as of right now, I did not see any improvement at all taking it."
1,I hate fake products,I returned the fake product for refund. Amazon should remove them from their seller's list
2,Another product that possibly has long term use side effects!,"recently I've taken an interest in actually evaluating the supplements I've been taking and seeing if they are good for me long term...""Consumer Reports identified 12 supplement ingredients linked to serious adverse events by clinical research or case reports ..... The dozen are aconite, bitter orange, chaparral, colloidal silver, coltsfoot, comfrey, country mallow, germanium, greater celandine, kava, lobelia, and yohimbe. Surprisingly, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned about at least eight of these, some as long ago as 1993; those eight supplements include chaparral, colloidal silver, comfrey, country mallow, germanium, kava, lobelia, and yohimbe. But warnings have not prevented retailers from selling supplements containing these ingredients""So if you must take a product that's possibly dangerous, at least cycle it on 2 weeks then off 2 weeks."
1,Didn't want to turn blue!,I read and researched this type of product and found out that there have been people who have used/drank this and had blue complexion afterwards. I opted to return it because there is no cure for turning blue.
4,Silver Biotics,"Good to head off sickness at the first signs of sickness. This one is 10ppm. I just don't know if it's as good as the one with 18ppm, but for the price it's good."
5,Silver Biotics,"I don't know how this product works, but since using Silver Biotics, I have not had ANY kind of illness ... No colds, no sinus infections, nothing! I have been using this product for over two years now. It is a big part of my ""survival"" kit! It should be on every grocery store shelf!"
5,Great when inhaled!,"I got a $50 nebulizer and I inhale some silver nano particles as treatment for lung infections. I woke the other day with painful coughing [not a good sign to say the least]. I was nearly out of silver, big mistake, but I was able to empty the nasal spray bottle, the eyedropper bottle, wash out a little from the bottom of the empty bottle I had on the shelf as a reminder to reorder and I had enough to fill the nebulizer twice. I treated the condition by breathing the silver nano particles deeply twice that day. The next day I was worried when I woke up but essentially, I was a good bit better, not feverish as much.. but I was out of the silver at a time when I normally would want to treat twice more that day. The condition kept getting better though, it takes a couple of days for the lung tissue to get rid of the silver so I guess it was still in there working away.."
2,analog dial is better,"Digital numbers jump on the way down, so you can't tell between two numbers. Sweep dial is better. Don't do digital!"
5,Love The Sheets,These sheets are soft and comfortable. My only regret is that I did not but more than one set while they were on such a great sale!!
5,very nice,"For the price, these are very nice.I've paid three times the price before and the quality was no better. Shipment was prompt also."
5,"If you have a boys firetruck quilt or room, this is for you","these sheets are not only soft, but go wonderfully with my boys firetruck, transportation room. His quilt has gingham check trim and accents and this sheet set (in brick) goes PERFECTLY and the price at $16.99 shipped is excellent. These are not cheap sheets!!! The sheets are thick and soft. Excellent deal. I prompty ordered the blue gingham (windstream) to use alternating to match the blue-denim in his quilt. Very, very nice set. Better than expected!"
3,Too Huge,"These sheets are great color, good quality but it's just too big for my mattress. Not everyone has a ""CAL"" or pillowtop mattress."
5,Outstanding sheets and service,"I have never been so impressed with my Gingham Flannel sheets. The fit was very generous and had enough to tuck in the sides, which is a rarity. The flannel was soft and luxurious. The delivery was so fast I thought I had just purchased them at astore. Thanks!"
5,Wonderfully soft and fluffy,"I had never purchased sheet sets without first ""feeling"" them, but ordered this set to try it out, especially since the price was right. I have been very pleased with this sheet set along with the duvet cover. The fabric is oh-so-soft and thick. The quality is much higher than I had expected. I think I'll need to order another set because since I've slept with these, I don't think I'll go back to standard cotton."
4,A nice change with beautiful scenes,"All 3 workouts are at outdoors. Each workout is about 25 minutes long plus there are instructions as intro, about 2 minutes long.I like both pilates and balance ball workouts. Both have very nice scenes, pilates at the beach and ball at near the stream. Both cues are soothing, not like Kathy Smith or Denise Austin. I like both Kathy and Denise but this one makes me a change. Pilates workout has two instructors with modified version. The head instructor has friendly tones. Balance ball workout has only one instructor but work out is easy to follow. All equipments you need are a mat and a ball. If you are in advanced level, this may not for you.For yoga, the scene is nice, seems like a desert, but I somehow don't like this male instructor. He seems instructional but I like Sara Ivanhoe's Crunch: the Perfect Yoga, which has two workouts. I took one star off for yoga section. (By the way, he is doing yoga at noon... in the desert! )"
5,Fun exercise,"I have used the Balance Ball for a long time. The ABS ball is made well, keeps air, is just the right size and is fun to use. I would recommend it for anyone who wants variety in their workout."
4,I love this video,"I really love this video. I like having three different workouts on one DVD. The length of each workout is perfect. The balance ball and Pilates workouts are a good challenge for me. I don''t find the yoga as challenging, but I still like it for a change."
5,works great for garmin iques,"i had that suction mount for my iQue-M3, and due to weather fluctuations, its rubber lost its grip and several times my gps fell down while driving. dash-mount like this, is awesome. it stays good for ANY weather. hot weather increases the friction of rubber to the plastic/fiber dash. one can use the old cradle charger (one which comes with the suction mount packing), but that doesnt have a loud speaker like this one has. it makes direction loud and clear, even if u are listening to music or anything."
1,good concert....but.....uhhh...,"I was there at downsview park and attended this great concert and then hoped it would come out on dvd or video. When it was released I was shocked. They wanted $29.99 at walmart!!! What a rip off! Attending the concert was only $25.50(including taxes from ticketmaster). A week later I had borrowed a copy of it from a friend that had purchased it, sat down and watched. What!!?? only about 2 songs of each band!! They don't even show the best of the bands sets. The quality didn't seem that great either. My advice to anyone thinking of buying this dvd is that if your favourite band(s)is on this dvd then buy it, if your favourite bands aren't really on it and you just want a concert to watch then DO NOT buy this dvd. It is definately a crappy dvd and not worth the money. Go buy the Monterey International Pop Festival 1967 DVD set instead."
3,could have been much better,"I don's get it. Are you not trying to sell this DVD? Most people like me who have bought the DVD did so because they were at the concert. This DVD give Sass Jordon more stage time then AC/CD or the The Guess Who. I have to give credit to Jeff Healy who played on one of S Jordon's numbers. He stole the show. I couldn't understand why he was not one of the main performers, instead of the other fillers. At the concert my wife convinced me to take my son for a bathroom break. It took almost an hour and I missed the Guess Who doing 'taking care of business'. Guess what this song is not on the DVD. You still have some great performances from Blue Rodeo, The Guess Who, AC/DC and of course the Rolling Stones on this DVD. Thank God this is a DVD so you can go directly to your favourite performances."
3,More Footage!!,"love some of the bands.. My fave, The Tea Party only had 3 songs, but in their last song, ""Sister Awake"", they had the crowd going just as hard as any of the main bands. They got a huge ovation. RIP Tea Party"
3,Where is the best of it?,"All in all it was a not bad video, though I was really expecting to see the best of the concert and more of it. Comeon AC/DC was given two songs plus the one they sang with The Rolling Stones. I just thought that it wouldn't have killed them to give us the whole concert. Come on Angus stripped to The Jack, got to be the best. I think they should have at least played all of AC/DCs songs and the Stones. I would have loved to see the rest too. Justin fighting off water bottles etc."
4,Shocks,"I bought these shocks to replace a leaking shock on my 2003 GMC Sonoma . So I decided to replace all 4 with KYB. I did not notice a big difference from to old GM shocks to the new KYB ones. I have bought this brand before when I had a 2000 S10 with a ZQ8 suspension, and loved the ride. But the new ones are a little to soft for me. That is why I gave it a 4 out of 5. The shocks are a good deal for the money."
3,IT COULD BE BETTER,good things first the girls are really hot and the music is very relaxing ok heres the bad stuff its nothing but tna no hardcore action never and they dont seem tolike doing i rate this 3/5 well thats my review
5,Moving story of three women in turbulent China,This is a great book. I highly recommend it. It gives a very personal perspective on a very turbulent time in China's history at the same time educating the reader in Chinese modern history. I could not put this book down.
5,For everyone interested in understanding China,"Do yourself a favor and read this book! If you have even a passing interest in understanding the largest country in the world, this book belongs on your must-read list. My wife and I traveled through much of China last year, and I must say that so much of what we saw and felt became so much more meaningful after reading this incredible account of three brave and wonderful women. I sincerely recommend this book."
5,Wild Swans: Three Daughters of China,"I had never heard of this book when I picked it off the ""China"" shelf in the bookstore--I just wanted to read about Mainland China so that I could know a little more about someone I tutor in English. I was mesmerized. One strength of the book (besides the author's passion and her beautiful writing) is that you understand each of the 3 generations in the context of the others. The grandmother's world, China in the '20's, suggests why the communists (or something like them) were necessary and how deeply Mao betrayed that necessity. I knew very little about the Cultural Revolution except what appeared in the papers--now I see how crucial it is for us all to know the details, from people who were there. Read Hannah Arendt's Totalitarianism in light of Mao--it's all there."
2,list of facts,"I didn't think there was much to this ""story"". Yes, tons of facts that I enjoyed learning about. but, I felt I was reading out of the encyclopedia.Could have used better editing."
2,Not as expected.,"Seller is obviously a middleman who orders a book from a 3rd party when a book is ordered from seller. My book is definitely not ""nearly new"". Buyer gets an email excusing delivery time of up to 21 days in mail with request to not post a negative review. Seller won't provide tracking. I will look elsewhere next time."
2,A Vew of 20th Century China,"Jung Change does an excellent job of helping her readers to understand the history of twentieth century China by telling the life stories of herself, her mother and grandmother. Fascinating."
2,"Anybody wants to read a self-glorifying, self-centered story filled with grumble?","I am the kind of person who cannot stand sustained negativity, so I never finished reading this book. I really think the author is a talented and smart person, and from what I hear from my parents I also think what she is telling is mostly true. But I feel sorry for her for what she must have suffered from her selfishness and her own negative view of everything around her. I used to be like that many many years ago and I know how it hurts. Anything has both good side and bad side. I think it's more healthy to remember what good things happened rather than how terrible things were which nobody can do anything about.This book could be much better if the author had more sense of humor and described everything in a lighter tone."
1,Don't Be Fooled,"I specifically ordered a hardback from this ""business"" and received a paperback. It even had a magazine article tucked inside it. Well, the main points are that I didn't receive what I ordered, and there is no prepaid return plan, soooo I paid $30 plus for a used paperback. Now, how would you rate business practices such as these? Would you want to do business like this? It's an ongoing headache as I had to dispute a month ago. Be my guest if you like $30 plus used paperbacks when you order hardbacks and have to pay for returns!!!Wild Swans : Three Daughters of China"
1,Possibly the most boring book I have ever read,"Possibly the most boring book I have ever read. Once I laid it down it was difficult to pick up again. Much too long. The author needed a good editor. James McKinney, Hamden CT"
1,Waste of time,"The facts in this book are interesting, and the life this girl goes through is sad. but the book is just plain boring. The first part of the book is actually good. it is exciting and interesting. The second part is where the book falls apart, though. the author just spouts off about herself, and causes the book to be many extra pages. The book ends up being more like a fact book than an actual book. It is like reading a list of events...only having the list be very long. It isn't much of a book, in the end. I wouldnt suggest reading this book...it ends up being a waste of time, in my opinion. read the first part, then just put the book down."
5,Gonna buy this book for my nieces,I thought this was a great book. It's one of many that make me *so* glad I'm an American living in this day and age. Wild Swans is a book that really puts the world and history into perspective.
1,Kindle edition full of errors.,"I doubt anyone read the text of Wild Swans after that fine book was scanned or ported into a Kindle version. Dates are confusing, since 6's become 0's. Terns are garbled--""capitalist roaders"" become ""capitalist readers."" Shame on Simon & Schuster and Amazon for presenting their customers with such shoddy work."
5,Poignant Portrait of Soaring Above,"Ms. Chang (whose birth name Er-Hong means 'another/second wild swan') leads us from the anonymous shadowy past of her great-grandmother's enforced ignominy, her grandmother's struggle to find redemption and peace, through her Mother's blatant heroism and to the emergence from her own chrysalis of Maoism.Beautifully told, Ms. Chang leaves no one in her family whose story can be shared left out, and like ripples of fingers touching the water's surface, she weaves the lives of those around her family artfully and honestly into her story. While the tale often reads like a Sysiphean struggle, Ms. Chang never neglects the beauty and stubbornly pervasive hope that blossoms through the cracks in 20th century China.Historical, lyrical, part biography and autobiography, tragic, romantic and inspiring, there are few readers who would not enjoy this book with great satisfaction and end it with a hunger for more."
4,Wild Swans,"The book arrived in very good condition. The graphic details are pleasant when she decribes nature and disturbing when she descibes the many wars and the political uprisings. I recalled the USA uprisings in the late 60's and 70's when I read about the uprisings in China during those years.It makes me wonder if we are due for politiacl uprisings here in the USA. I was in Beijing for 4 days in 1992 and saw the Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, the Great Wall and other sights. Our guide would not talk about conditions in China.I know China has built a new airport since then as well as many other attractions in preparation for the Olympics they held a few years ago. Reading this book would make a person shudder at the thought the USA would become a socialist country, much less a communist country."
2,slow,"The book started off pretty well. The story of her grandmother with the bound feet, living as a concubine, trying to escape the culture, yet integrally woven into it; this was all very interesting. And the area when Mao took over with his foggy regime is enthralling. But then the book trails off and becomes frankly boring. Granted, she's had a more eventful life than I, but she sort of lost track of the focus about halfway through, as though she were excited about writing the book in the begining, but lost her concentration along the way and just sort of wrapped it up at the end. Overall, I would not recommend this book. 60 to 80 pages of interesting material, and lots of filler."
3,very informative,"Ms. Chang completely described the life of women during the time that I can't identify myself with. I was extremely angry with Ms. Chang when she talked about her great grandfather and her grandfather. During that time, society allowed men to treat women with zero respect, and yet, it is funny to understand that those men still crawled into women's beds every night to find pleasure. Silly people. Well written book. Ms. Chang lovingly talked about her grandma and her mom. Sweet and yet sad story to read and to understand the life under Mao's dictation."
2,too factual,"It felt like I was reading a history book and not a story book. I know it was historical, but I really couldn't get into it."
2,"Based on previous reviews, I wanted to like this book. BUT.","The subject matter is clearly fascinating . . . an insider's description of the turbulent history of China over the past 150 years . . . And yet ultimately the book disappoints. The writing is stilted and often turgid . . .where was the editor? The high drama of China reads like an old-fashioned text book, and reminds me why I used to ""hate history"" in school. A good editor or secondary writer could have made this a blockbuster. I'm sorry. It didn't work for me."
4,very intriguing look at life in china,the book progresses through the three generations that saw tremendous social changes in china. the three generations of women all responded with spirit and courage to the challenges of their times.
5,A brilliant narrative of real life horror.,"Wild Swans is one the most moving books I've ever read. Chang writes in a very matter-of-fact manner to convey the horror suffered by her family, but I think this style makes her story seems more horrific and true. I've read a lot of novels set in Communist China, and Wild Swans is, by far,the hardest one to put down.."
4,A family's history reflects and explains the larger culture,"From then until now -- a fascinating and heartbreaking trace of the author's personal history, through three generations of women, within the context of the dramatic changes which have occurred before, during, and since China's Cultural Revolution. Includes photographic illustrations. Highly recommended."
5,Out of darkness into the light,"China, especially Chinese society and government, has been a closed book for most of my lifetime. Jung Chang brings it to light in a way that is both intensely personal and incredibly interesting. Those that want history they have never read before from a perspective that cannot be matched must read this book. I cannot say enough good things about this book, nor recommend it too highly. BUY IT! READ IT! PASS IT ON!"
5,What I expected,I got it for my chinese literature class and saved a few bucks. It came on time and was as described.
4,"Planning to travel to China, read this one",Perfect primer for anyone planning on visiting China. Ms. Chang provides an easy to read 20th century history of China through the lives of a Chinese family.
4,insightful classic,"it's a great read, insightful and personal as well as informative. It's a classic, still banned in China. The ebook edition has some typing errors."
5,The story of an unusal family,"The story of this family is not usual. The grandmother was the mistress of a warlord, the mother was a communist revolutionist, and her daughter, the author of the book has escaped form China as a young girl. The thing I respect the most, that the author has only used personal experiences, and only written about things she has seen with her own eyes, or things which has happened with her family, and never used unchecked stories in her descriptions. She never tells a word in her story against the regime, even when she writes about the most shocking events in her family, but leave the reader to create his or her own opinion."
4,Excellent view of recent China from a woman's eye,I enjoyed and was amazed at the role of the women in the history of this culture within my lifetime. Hard to realize how different the lives of women can be in different parts of the world. I have always had an interest in the EAST and this book certainly adds to the intrigue and interest I have in China and other eastern cultures.
5,Who?,"I have taught English in several universities in southern China, students and adults. When Chinese students ask, ""What do Americans think of China?"", I reply that ""We learn about China from writers like Jung Chang"". I show them my copy of Wild Swans. None of the students have ever heard of Jung Chang, but they seem eager to read it. Recently, I saw four copies in an English language bookstore in Guangzhou. I found the book very depressing to read: page-after-page of the Chinese being cruel to each other."
2,Couldn't get into it.,"The subject matter is fascinating and I tried to stay with this book, but I found myself having to make myself keep reading. A good book is one where you want to read it, not feel like you HAVE to.Couldn't figure out why I wasn't liking this book until I read some of the other reviews here and some of the reviewers nailed it: the book lacks feeling."
4,Rather tedious,I found it interesting for the first half of the book but then it became redundant and tedious.
4,Wild Swans,We are leaving for China this month. This book has been very informative. It helps to set the scene for our trip. I consider it a worthwhile read.
4,A Clear Insight into Communist China,"I was impressed by Jung Chang's biography of Mao. Wild Swans puts that work into perspective showing what life was like, especially for women, in the waning days of the Chinese Republic and under the communists. The most striking thing is that all the ""brilliant"" young State Department officers who saw Mao as an agrarian reformer trying to modernize China were WRONG!!! This work shows on a personal level how that megalomaniacal, bloody-handed dictator actually ruled his kingdom. It also puts into context the American Left's ""war against individualism"" (Ted Kennedy) and what it could lead to if they ever got power."
3,A good book. Ting-Xing Ye's A Leaf... is far SUPERIOR,"This was a good and interesting book. Ting Xing Ye's A Leaf in the Bitter Wind is in the same vein, however, and is written with far greater beauty and skill. The books also make interesting contrasts, from different parts of China and different cultures as well one family being involved in the revolution while the other was, from the beginning, victimized by it. Christopher Patten's East West is another well written and interesting book dealing with China and Amy Tan is another writter whose stories are told with greater skill and subtlety than this one by Jung Chang. I encourage anyone who has read this to read A Leaf in the Bitter Wind which is not only a great story, but a great book."
4,Amazingly moving and well written,"This book is amazingly moving and well written. Anyone who is even remotely curious about the life of ordinary Chinese women throughout the 20th century should read this work. It not only describes the stories of three generations of Chinese women, but it transports the reader to world that the author is describing. I definitely recommend this book. Often I will sell biographies after reading them, but this book is a keeper."
5,Wonderful Story!,"This story tugs at one's heart strings. It is very well written, with detailed characters and suspenseful plot turns. And along the way it provides interesting detail about the history of China. All in all, a very good read."
5,Riveting,"Because it was closed to the West for so long, China is viewed with apprehension by Westerners. This book will give you a new understanding of China. It encompasses China's 20th century history as in a school text book but reads like a novel. I've read about 20 books this summer, and ""Wild Swans"" was by far the best."
5,A SIMPLE STORY ABOUT HISTORY,"If you don't have the time to read about China's history, or the disposition to sift through the scholars works, but have the desire to learn about the social structure of this nation and the workings of the chinese family and human relations, in and outside China, then you must read this book. It is a personal, and at times poetic, account of the saga of a family from the Empire, through the Kuomingtang period, the war, and Mao's regime. Very well written and moving, it is like a personal time machine, filled with the details of the hardships and personal sacrifices that the people, among titanic social and political changes, had to endure. It is in a sense a microcosmic tale, but one that helps to understand in simple terms the background texture; the causes and motivations for the radical transformations that China experienced in the last century. It also provides food for though, if you want to better understand the changes that will came in this century....."
4,A Chronicle of Strength and Bravery,"Wild Swans is a compelling account of how Jung Chang and her family endured the brutality, torture, censorship and terror of China's modern history. She honestly describes what they endured and how they managed to go on when surrounded by injustice, pettiness, and physical horrors. I like how she also adds details of traditional Chinese values (e.g. poetry, nature) thus we learn of her heritage. (I want to read some classical Chinese poetry and more Chinese history.) She includes a lot of the political and historical background so readers understand the context of the events she describes.The only draw back is that she often uses cliches (e.g. ""My father really stuck to his guns."") rather than some more original writing."
5,A tragic & moving story sure to make one understand China!,"This heart-rending account, rivalling Shakespeare for its theatricality and tragedy, is all the more remarkable not because it actually happened to real people but rather that these were among the more privileged examples of Chinese women.I recommend this book to your readers very strongly."
3,A long slog,"Jung Chang's book was recommended as an excellent introduction to the horrors of the Cultural Revolution. However, I was forewarned that it would be a slow read until I got to Ms. Chang's story. Well, that was an understatement! I really struggled through the first half of the book with the all people weaving in and out of the lives of the grandmother and mother. This book could have greatly benefited from better editing. While I appreciated learning about their lives and struggles, it wasn't necessary all the minutiae. Instead, it was more interesting learning about the insanity of the Cultural Revolution and how the country was turned upside down because of the selfish whims of a small man. After reading this book, you begin to grasp the monumental changes that have occurred in China's mentality during the last 40 years."
4,A compelling personal modern history of China,"The story helps the reader to understand the recent history of China within the context of the last 60 years of modern China by retracing the lives of 3 women, her grandmother, her mother and herself. These personal stories start from the waning days under the Imperial regime prior to 1911 through the modern China of present days. It is told with objectivity and clarity. It also has a universal appeal as it illustrates the theme of the strength of the human spirit over cruelty and adversity."
5,A Light that Shines on Golden Bookshelves,Knowledge. Perspective. Beauty. Pain. Loyalties. Honour. Dogma. Treason. Lies. Humour. Anguish. Hope. Hate. Love. Fear.Humbled and enriched to have read this book. I wish someday to meet its author and thank her for the privelege.Give yourself the same gift when you are ready to receive it.
5,fantastic book,"Jung Chang writes an incredible account of three generations of Chinese history. Not only engaging and interesting for its historical significance, but this book is also just a darn fine read."
4,Truly stunning,"Wild Swans sat on the coffee table for years as my dad made his way through it- picking it up and putting it down. When I asked if I could read it, I was dismayed that my dad had finally returned it to my aunt. A year later my dad produced a new copy of Wild Swans. This book absloutely changed my world. I believed that all men and women lived like me, oblivious to their worlds and their culture (I was only fifteen when I read this book!). Books have been such a huge part of my childhood but Wild Swans changed the way I wanted to read. Gone are the days of lightwieght stories, but powerhouse novels that move me. This book is truly amazing. Please read it."
3,Not what I was looking for/expecting,"I very much respect the author's thorough research. She adequately described a period of time I knew little about and for that it was interesting. However, I found it almost boring many times. Which is funny to admit since the subject matter was so unusual. I obviously didn't do my research on this book because I didn't realize just how political it was going to be. I was hoping for more ""feeling"" (as others have said) and less facts. I think that's why I couldn't really get into it. It is NOT a page turner. I struggled to finish it but I couldn't let myself give up on it. In the end, I'm glad I read it but it's just not the kind of book I truly enjoy."
5,A masterpiece,"It must be extremely difficult to remain objective when writing a biography of yourself and your family when the setting is as tragic as 20th Century China. This book surpasses the excellent Victor Villasenor family history of his Mexican family's exodus to the United STates by providing a great deal of historical and political background to her incredible story. So, you not only get the remarkable story of her struggle through the excesses of Mao's China; but she more than adequately outlines the reasons for these excesses.Tragedy often affords certain individuals to display a courage and patience that inspires and instills optimism in the human condition. Ms. Chung writes a very human and moving account of one woman's struggle and triumphant over a society gone mad.I recommend this book highly to anyone interested in the China and toll Mao's ego inflicted on his own people."
4,A century of suffering for one Chinese family,"This book is a readable, straightforward saga that puts recent Chinese history into heartbreaking perspective. Jung Chang does us all a great service with this account of her family's experiences at the hands of a cruel traditional society, the Japanese, the Kuomintang and Mao. I'd give it five stars, but, being a tough grader, I reserve those only for the really, really classic books. Readers interested in more on the sufferings of modern China might also appreciate Life and Death in Shanghai by Nien Cheng (more on the Cultural Revolution) and The Rape of Nanking by Iris Chang (the hellish experiences of the people of that city after it fell to the Japanese in 1937). The lesson, of course, is that the problem lies not with the Chinese or the Japanese, the communists or the capitalists, but with all of us if we do not open our eyes to the realities of history and vow ""Never, never, never again."""
5,book,Wild Swans : Three Daughters of ChinaI have not had a chance to read this book but look forward to the opportunity. My friends have told me it is a great book with very concerning information.
5,Wild Swans arrive on my doorsteps within days...,I ordered Wild Swans and it arrived within the week that I ordered it. It was in perfect condition and I can't wait to start reading it. Very impressed with the seller.
4,"Hollywood Style, rated high mainly by Westerners","I read Wild Swans in 1995. Since many of my American friends rated this book highly, I tried to read it again two years later, but I could not finish it. Something is missing in the book from a Chinese point of view. Many of my Chinese friends who are all great writers, have the same opinion as mine: it was written in Hollywood style to appeal to Western readers, but it does not appeal to Chinese readers and writers.I like ""Life and Death in Shanghai"", ""Daughter of China"" and ""Flying High Out of a Tibetan Valley"" better than ""Wild Swans"". Those three books are true to life."
2,Not worth the money,Not worth the money - bad story line - weak plot - too many close-ups at the beginning. In general I'd like my money back.
1,Don't buy it!,"This DVD is unable to reflect the true essence and spirit of Southern France. The music is no good. Most of the natural scenery and wild life footage can be seen any where and not uniquely from S. France. It shows a few ducks, fish, flamingoes... The major cities and architecture are nowhere presented."
3,Fun but nothing special,No control except the speed at which you want to chace it around the street.
1,Not worth the price.,"This toy was flown by an adult and lasted less than one full charge before breaking. The tail broke off and had to be taped on and then the actual fusilage broke apart. I have used other air hogs toys and found them to be of much better quality than this one. Even if the plane hadn't been a cheap piece of junk, it only flies in circles, so it doesn't present any educational value or challenge for the kids. If you are thinking about an R/C plane, don't be suckered into this one."
1,Worst toy on the market if they offered 0 stars I would have given it to this toy!,"This toy looked cool in the package so I bought it for my 10 y/o son. He played with it for less than 10 minutes and it was trashed! The nose was caved in, the wings were broken, it was in like 5 pieces. If I hadn't been sitting there watching him play with it I would have swore that he tore it apart. All I can say is save the time and throw your $30 ( I got it on sale) directly into the trash!"
5,Seen the program...,"Very good, I have the cd and love it, I'm a little less enamored with the book, but I think the dvd is great."
5,A little Dyer book to carry around with you,"This is one of my favorite books by Wayne. It is short and simple to understand. It embraces all of his concepts of peace, enlightenment and higher conciousness.I like this book because it is short, sweet and to the point.You could buy this book and no others and it gives you all you need to master yourself.Tt is small enough to carry in your handbag of briefcase to access anytime that you are feeling disconnected. 2 minutes of reading and you're back on track to the awareness we all so crave.Highly recommended!"
5,Hermosas y de excelente calidad,Mi hermano quedó encantado con su regalo. Como siempre de excelente calidad y acabado. Son bellisimas
5,"Walkabout Harness is a ""Back-saver""","Last year our 90lbs German Shepherd, like many older shepherds, began to loose control of his back legs due to degenerative nerve damage. Hauling him up and down the stairs using a towel as a sling became a painful chore and walking around the yard so that he could do his business was a dreadful mess. We've tried many harnesses and slings but we've found none better than the Walkabout Harness. Foremost, it's a great relief on the back! The sling is easy to use, easy to clean and stays in place while going up and down the stairs - even though we don't use the clasps to close the harness around the dog's back. The dog can do his business without having to move the sling! The fabric is robust to the regular cleaning and has lasted for over a year before requiring a replacement. We're very happy with the sling and it's added many months to our journey with our dog. This is an excellent product - we have three..."

1,sink dog shower,"The adapter to the faucet was entirely too small. Would not fit any faucets in the house. I had to trim it with scissors to use it on the kitchen sink. I have standard faucets throughout the house. Unfortuately after as much trimming as I needed to do for it to fit, there was no seal for the water to stay in the hose. It is now useless."
5,Love it!,"I really didn't have great expectations of this movie, seeing it as a mediocre production, but after seeing it while babysitting, I loved it!It had unique flavor, an exceptional story line, and a sweet ending that left me satisfied."
4,"Great film, boo on blu-ray","This is a great film for kids and parents to watch together, well animated and great humor! Only criticism is that the blu-ray is unbelievably slow to load, and the previews are cumbersome when a child just wants to watch the film..."
5,Great dvd!,"This dvd is a great family movie! Very innovative, funny, and good lessons. Thanks amazon!"
3,Hmmm... Probably one of the weirdest movies ever.,"This is one of the weirdest movies I've ever watched. It was different in a way that I can't quite put my finger on.First of all, you have to understand that I'm prejudiced against penguin movies. It seems like since the March of the Penguins movie came out, there have been more penguin movies then seems necessary. First Happy Feet(which was terrible, by the way) then this. How many movies about penguins can there be?The other thing is way was a documentary? It could have been better if it hadn't been a documentary.I don't know if that's helpful or not but there it is. This is just one of those movies that didn't really keep in my mind. It was just kind of a dumb, feel-good-about-yourself kind of movie."
1,Doped-up chicken should not be in a kids movie,simple. Having a chicken who appears to be off its face on drugs in an animated kids movie is bad taste - even in these lax times. Sure its great for the adults but allowing drug culture into a kids movie is bogus. What's next - nude simulated sex for Barbie Dolls in Toy Story 3?Let kids have their slice of entertainment without inserting vice. They will get plenty of time to be bombarded with adult stuff when they are teens and hopefully more informed to have an opinion as to like or dislike.
2,Boring and odd.,"This movie is hard to describe. It's a cartoon version of a documentary of surfing penguins. Because it tries to feel and look like a documentary, it is neither cute nor funny. So there is no reason to see it. Some consider it a mockumentary but it would have to be at least a little bit funny to qualify as a mockumentary. Admittedly, I find the whole genre of mockumentary stupid. Even the ""best"" of them,This Is Spinal Tap (Special Edition), was unable to hold my attention in spite of several attempts to watch the thing based on its inclusion in Top 100 lists.Want proof? I took my 7 year old to the local drive-in to see it. He'll even watch Pokemon. He lost interest quickly and began to play with the other children in the area, all of whom had also lost interest. The adults lost interest just as quickly and began standing around in groups discussing anything but the movie. Yes it was that bad."
1,Not Impressed,"This movie was not very impressive. It was simply a documentary formed as a cartoon if I wanted to see a real documentary I would have just rented one with actual humans! This movie is a cute concept but is for older kids, as they use concepts such as bad language and death throughout the film. This is not for little kids due to those two things. Plus my three year old and five year old, watched it for the first ten minutes and then where totally bored and left the room. So this movie did not hold there attention. I thought this was going to be a cute movie about penguins that they could enjoy because of the spectacular reviews this movie has recieved. Turns out it was just the opposite. Needless to say we where all very disappointed."
5,Fun Family Movie,I think this movie is enjoyable for the whole family. We watched it the other night and everybody loved it!
5,Great children's movie,I'm a big kid at heart and love watching animated movies from time to time. This is definitely going to be one of those classic animated movies. Highly recommend
5,One of the funniest movies I have seen in a while and will make you want to surf.,"This movies was great! I loved it. It is basically a documentary about penguins surfing. It has wit, humor and amazingly realistic scenes. I think it will make you want to try surfing after seeing."
3,Documentary Disappointment,"I bought this movie for my sister for Christmas (she is 20 by the way!) because she loves disney/animated movies, and after she watched it I asked her how'd she liked it and she was disappointed because it was told as a documentary. I think this movie could have been better."
1,Disapointed to say the least,This was the most disappointing animated film we've seen in a long time. It was all I could do to stay awake. Our 4 yr old was board to tears.
1,Couldn't play dvd,"For some mysterious reason, we were unable to get this blu-ray movie to play in our blu-ray machine. All other blu-ray movies purchased, played just fine. It's strange...maybe a glitch at the manufacturing site."
1,Surf's Up,"I don't know what happened but the package never came. I don't know if it was delivered when I wasn't home, or what, but I never got it."
4,"Fun, family movie","My kids couldn't wait to get this movie on dvd after seeing it in the theater. It's an enjoyable movie, but it did not hold their interest as well the second time around. Since we purchased it through Amazon at an incredible price, it was still worth the money."
4,Great Family Fun,"I reluctantly saw this at the movies this summer expecting another ""Happy Feet"" (which I hated) but could not have been more blown away. There was enough to entertain both kids and adults alike - laugh out loud funny in places with thouroughly memorable characters. The bottom line, if the kids loved it, it's worth buying - and this one is!"
4,another penguin movie?,"how many penguin movies are out there now? well, i have seen them all, and this is a very good one! if you like animated movies, you will love this one. superb video quality, especially on blu-ray. entertaining from start to finish!"
5,Surfs Up movie,I usually don't sit down and watch a kids movie more than once. This one is worth watching a few times with your kids. Really good lessons too.

4,good movie bad video game,"when the PS3 game costs less then the blu-ray movie you know the game sucks, well i assure you that it does."
4,Cute for the,children. Teaches about not giving up on dreams. A new generation kid learns from the old generation some new tricks and becomes a better penquin for it.
4,Cute movie,I love how this was filmed like a reality show. The kids and adults love it. I let my brother and sister inlaw borrow it and they thought it was cute.
5,"BEAUTIFUL ANIMATION AND FRESH APPROACH MAKE 'SURF'S UP' ! "" AWESOME DUDES!""","'Surf's Up' is one of the best animated films I have ever seen or at least in the CGI era of animation. The Mockumentary style and incredible animation keep the story fresh, funny and amazing to look at! Even if your not a fan of animated films, this one may change your mind. The film also has a hip and appropriate soundtrack. The DVD transfer is excellent and this is a must see movie!.....Cowabunga!"
5,Fun Book,"This is a great book for children and adults, alike. Not big but an easy and delightful read. You learn a lot about how Christmas in celebrated in Sweden."
3,"Almost, but not quite","No qualms with the sturdy, wooden base. But the rings are very cheap. They're too small; and they're made of hard, light-weight plastic."
3,It works like it's supposed to.,"Nothing special about this toy; it's pretty basic, but it works fine. I like how easily you can break it down to store it."
1,desert trojan!,"mostly for children, too light weight, rings are so light in weight their like kleenex......we were disappointed in its weight, otherwise o.k."
4,Indoor & outdoor game,"This ring toss set can be played both outdoors or indoors, a rainy day of the year.Kids that love to visit game's park or Luna Park can practise with this one.It's a pitty that rings aren't in 4 different colours and i had to buy an extra set.The base stand's well on a table or in the ground and if you keep the right distance you can win.Kid's love it!"
1,POOR QUALITY,"This product literally lasted 20 minutes before it fell apart. Two of the stands barely stuck in.....Terrible, terrible, terrible. do not buy"
2,not much fun,my 2 and 3 year olds really haven't taken to this toy at all. i don't think it is worth spending money on it. you can probably make something of this nature yourself.
5,Hilarious,We love this movie as it provided many belly-laughs by great performances of rivals portrayed by both Gene Hackman and Ray Romano!
4,good treat for training,"our little terrier mix loves these, but then she loves anything that smells of peanut butter. very little mess and a quick reward treat for training purposes"
1,1 star,"Best Buddy Bits-Cheese Flavor 5.5 oz. package. This treat contains garlic powder which is toxic to some dogs according to my Vet. My dog as well as a relative's dog became violently ill after eating these treats. We both ended up with $ 400 Vet bills. I contacted the manufacturer, Exclusively Pet, Inc. months ago but I never heard back from them."
1,Be careful! Contains some Demonic songs,"CAUTION!! We bought this for my son and found there are actually several demonic songs on this cd. One of which is called ""Demons"" and is a dialog between a possesed man and the demon that posesses. It is done by a man named Randy Rose. You can see his demonic (not being overly dramatic here) website here: [...]His music is comparable with black sabbath, but possibly worse. There are 6 songs we ended up taking off the ipod. We would like to see this out of circulation! :("
4,Fun DVD for the kids-some new songs,Bought this as a gift for my friend's son and he loved it. He loves all of the Wiggles DVDs and I think this one had at least one new song.
4,"Catchy songs, bright colors, awful dubbing","This is one of our first Wiggles dvd's. My kids love it. The visuals are great. I think the songs are pretty catchy and... not terrible. I appreciate the Wiggles for the use of harmony and interesting instrumentation while not losing the simplicity that appeals to kids. They are definitely one of my favorite kids' groups.The only negative about this dvd is that the dubbing is just terrible! It is rare that the lips of the performers are mouthing the same word that we're hearing. My kids are not bothered by it and as long as I don't actually look at it, it doesn't bother me either. But goodness, you'd think they could get a better dubbing engineer."
3,Good but not great,"The video has some good songs and my 15 month old enjoys watching it. My only complaint is that it seems like all the songs were taken from a previous video ""wake up Jeff ""."
4,Live from the American Ballroom,This is really a great mix and captures the fun and energy of Donna The Buffalo. Definite buy.
2,The History of the Confederate Treasury,"The book is much overpriced. Although the reprinted book has a caveat, ""it may possibly have occasional imperfections...beyond our control,"" pages 8 and 80 of my copy was obliterated in the printing process of the reproduction and not a fault of the original. Had the seller made this more clear, I would not have purchased the book. However, the spoiled pages can be downloaded from a web site, but so can the entire book. My advice, stay away from this seller."
2,Good ideas; Dead on Arrival,"111 pages of a story with a lot of promise, and evidence that Rehak had definite talent and good ideas. But he tries to do too much in a book that doesn't know if it's a philosophical foray or a television drama. The one lesbian sex scene has its place in the book, but Rehak handles it like Penthouse Forum. 111 pages is not enough room to have philosophy, cliche television moments, and bland erotica.What Rehak shows is ambition in his effort to bring together interesting ideas, his writing style is clear, and he is organized in his thinking. He shows himself as a writer trying to challenge himself and his readers. Lots of promise here, but what is delivered is subpar and dragged down by corny plot twists, and overambition . However, with all sincerity, I think Rehak will improve and his second book should be worth reading."
4,"Not for everyone, but I liked it!","A Young Girl's Crimes, by David Rehak, may not be for all readers because of the graphic sex and etc., but, I liked his story. Based on a true story and certainly worth reading! A YOUNG GIRL'S CRIMES, had me glued to my seat from the first chapter on."
5,Wow!!,"I finished this book this morning and I still can't get it out of my head. This is one of my new favorites. Don't pay attention to negative reviews by intellectual elites, this book is a real winner! For a short book I thought maybe it wouldn't be much, but there's so much to it and its so good! The characters are well-developed and I love John and I feel sorry for Flora but I think we know where she's going. This book will appeal very much to the Lovely Bones and Flowers In The Attic reader. The writing style is very easy to follow and enjoy. The story is fantastic. This is a page-turner if there ever was one. 10 stars for entertainment!"
5,wonderful for all ages,"I purchased this book for my daughter even before she was born. Even after working in a children's bookstore for several years, and seeing every new release, this continues to be one of my top ten favorite's. It has a wonderful message about honesty without being preachy. Demi has grasped the consept that the moral of the story need not be obvious, children understand a lot more than most authors give them credit for. The illustrations are well done and provide a nice backdrop. The bonus is of course, that adults enjoy reading it as well."
5,"A beautiful story, with an important lesson.","This book is beautiful in all ways... the pictures... the words... the story... and the lesson. Even my 3 year old was able to grasp the moral of this story. Both my husband and I, as well as our daughter enjoyed this book!"
5,The Empty Pot,"Beautiful way to teach the values of honesty and integrity to any age. The child's father also teaches when you have done your best, be proud of yourself and don't worry about what others may think."
5,such a sweet story,This is such a wonderful book for kids. It has a timeless message about honesty and integrity wrapped in a sweet little story about a little boy growing up in China. Perfect for Mom or Dad to read to the children.
2,This book is HUGE,"This is a great kid's book. But, nowhere in the listing does it mention that this particular copy of the book that Amazon is selling is literally HUGE. it's the right number of pages - it's not thick; but for some reason it's oversized, measuring approximately 18x18 inches. it's so big there's nowhere to put it. why would that not be mentioned in the listing???"
1,Garmin M5 replacement battery by Osprey-Talon,"I purchased a replacement battery from Osprey-Talon for my Garmin iQue M5, through Amazon's website. The first battery would not take a charge. I returned it to Osprey-Talon. Osprey-Talon sent a replacement. It would not take a charge when left in the M5 overnight, using the Garmin plug in charger. The original Garmin battery that came with the M5 charges normally.The way the battery is advertised makes you think that it is an original Garmin battery. It is not. It is a Chinese made replacement."
1,Not M5 compatible ???,"Although it states M5 compatible, and it does work ...somewhat ... but creates other problems. Does not register on the battery charge indicator so you don't know what charge is remaining on the battery. Other problems seemed to be happening that were unexplained. Replaced with original Garmin M5 battery and problems disappeared. Don't buy it!"
3,Early California scene; historical fiction,"Read it for personal/family reasons. Peter B. Kyne (of San Francisco, I believe) was my grandfather's commanding officer in World War I in Europe. My grandmother read his books and named my mother for the ""heroine"" in this book, Kay (my mother's middle name). Kay then became my name and my neice's middle name. Book is probably very typical of the day (1920s) but describes brutal (disparaging and discriminatory) treatment of Asians in early twentieth century California."
3,Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm,"My momma said if you aint got nothin good to say, dont say nothin at all, but I cant help it. His first album went double platinum atleast, and his second was pretty good also, but honestly I'm a (beat) kind of a person, and this album had barely any. Thats that Bone feat.Wish Bone is really good, but then it fades into outerspace somewhere. I really admire Krayzie and Bone Thugs for being themselves rapping about issues and everyday life, not just bandwagon material. But I also need something to ride to, ya dig. Cmon Bone"
4,krayzie my dawg,krazie kicks it like usual nothen less than perect one of the illest out there killing every one else probly da best in bone thugs
2,Bone Thugs fell off there style!!!!! And are trying to hard!,"If you are a die hard bone thug like I am, do not buy this album with BTNH in mind, because this is competely awful production and awful studios.Krayzie Bone is always ripping the phat lyrics but awful awful!!!! producers and productions, and Krayzie talks about things like he has a Ph.D.Bone Thugs N Harmony are not the humble group that was camera shy talking about great things that dont necessarily always make sense but sells. This album is not intresting, nothing like his last two albums.I dont know why They cover their voices with wack beats. They need to turn down the volume and turn up the MIC because Bone Thugs dont need background music.This album is not PROFESSIONAL. It was half assed desperate for money. The track list is WRONG for goodness sakes, HOW $tuP!D are they. This album was rushed and a waste of money. It hurts for me to say that because i am die hard BTNH."
5,Lock Down!,"I wouldn't say he is the best MC in the world, but definetly one of the most skilled in terms of lyrical ryming. This cd is a really good album that you can put in a just chill too. I pretty much played it out, and then bought Bone Brothers which is also really good!worth buying, fa sho!"
5,Just great,This CD is one of my favorites and even if you do not understand the language it is a real joy to listen to. Very France.
4,A gift for the damned,"Ben's review said it all, and probably better than I could. I just want to add that I really disliked this CD the first time I listened to it, but gave it a few more tries and it eventually grew on me. A lot of people are quick to dismiss music like this without giving it a fair shot, so be patient if this doesn't grab your head and smash it into the sidewalk quickly enough. There's a lot going on here that can't be digested in one listen.The end effect is less a sum of the members' parts than you might expect (and certainly not the Earth-meets-Whitehouse sound that I secretly dreamt it would be from the band and album titles). I hear a bit of Melvins influence in here, maybe with half the weirdness and twice the evil. Anyway, expectations run high when names like these get together, but don't write it off too quickly if it's not what you thought it'd be. As doom metal goes, this record is definitely off on its own scary little planet."
4,Left a beatiful hole.,"Slow, soothing pain to calmly wake you from complaisant dreams. Makes it easy for push-ups or intercourse, if the conscious fever doesn't break your concentration."
2,Wrong book!,"I ordered ""The Death of Innocents"" by Helen Prejean, as shown in the item photo. However, I received and will return ""The Death of Innocents"" by Richard Firstmann."
2,Biased and lacking logic,"I admire Sister Helen's dedication and am grateful for the comfort she has provided people, but this book is a one-sided representation of the facts surrounding the death penalty. Furthermore, it is riddled with poor logic. Nonetheless, I take seriously the argument she presents. I recommend that people get informed about all aspects of this complex issue. The Death of Innocents can be a start, but make sure you utilize more resources than just this biased book."
2,Entertaining not comprehensive.... :(,"If you are serious about the subject that Prejean writes on you should always do a little research on your own. That means you don't limit yourself to what defense attorneys or anti-death penalty groups disseminate. It's what doesn't get printed or written about that makes you wonder more. Omitting evidence that indicates guilt where it exists is a disingenuous tactic.These works represent wonderful ""entertainment"" but are not conclusive or comprehensive. As noted in other reviews, Prejean excludes certain facts that don't necessarily agree with what makes her works interesting. Check court opinions on the Internet or the fine print in old news articles."
5,if you're undecided,"If you're undecided about the death penalty, please read this book. If you haven't thought about it that much because you basically trust the justice system to be fair enough, please read this book. If you want to know why Europeans think the U.S. death penalty is so barbaric, again, please read this book."
4,Good book on extinct birds,"Got it dirt cheap price, one of my hobbies is birdwatching and studying extinct bird species so got the book, I just wish it had more illustrations, but overall is a good read, excellent value, addition to my library."
5,Extraordinary in Every Way,"An extraordinarily carefully researched, poetically worded, and gloriously illustrated treatment of a distressingly ordinary (in the sense of common) topic. Deeply moving while also instructive."
3,Beginners Can Probably Do Better,I have been weight training for over 15 years and feel very tight and stiff all of the time. I wanted to try Yoga to loosen up a bit. This DVD has helped.This Flexibility section of the DVD has provided some basic stretching moves that have helped me to loosen up. I also find that I am standing straighter after the routine. I also like the relaxation period at the end of the routine. I find that it works very well.The DVD's biggest weakness is that it does not spend any time demonstrating how you should execute each position. Rodney simply tells you the name of the position and he gets into it. True beginners have no way of knowing if they are doing things correctly. I would suggest seeking a different DVD is you are a beginner like me.
2,Not for True Beginners,"My goal as a 39-yr old, fairly athletic man was to learn yoga basics before I embarassed myself in a class at the Y. I wanted to learn some breathing exercises, which were never mentioned here. I wanted to learn positions too, and at one point Rodney said he would show introductory versions of his more difficult ones (imagine some tripod thing, but angrier), but that never came. He told me to move my ""sip"" bone. I'm guessing occipital, but how about a little help here? Beginner, hello.For intermediates this is probably a great workout-Rodney knows what he's doing. As a beginner, it wasn't for me."
3,good yoga...,bad music. I think the exercises would work great but the crappy new age music is a little bit annoying.
4,Great Yoga DVD,"This DVD is a great 30 minute workout. Advanced yoga poses in the middle of the workout that will take time achieving if beginner, but overall an excellent workout."
4,Power Yoga: Strength and Flexibility,"Challenging yoga program! I like to vary this with other Gaiam yoga DVD's for relaxation, back care, etc."
3,About Average,"As an avid gardener I must say the book is small on ""how to"" as well as overall content. It is not as captivating as, ""The Findhorn Garden"", by the Findhorn Community. Her book is more of a personal dairy.The book is more for those interested in the esoteric side of Caddy.antar5@sbcglobal.net"
5,A Rare Look into the Pre A.D. 300 New Testament,"This momumental work explores the earliest New Testament writings (pre AD 300). The goals of the book are:. to give an annotated list of all significant Greek manuscripts. to assign dates for the earliest manuscripts. to examine the nomina sacra (standardized abbreviations) used in the early manuscripts. to present the history of textual variation in the early centuries of the church. to explore various methods of recovering the original wording of the Greek.All of this is within the main goal of helping students interact with the New testament test by knowing the original wording.This book gives a rare insight into the work of the scholars putting the Bible together from very fragmentary documents. All in all, it is amazing that so much material exists from almost two thousand years ago."
4,Excellent introduction to Paleography,This introduction to the NT manuscripts is highly readable and filled with fascinating insights. Its only downfall is the book's poor quality photographs of selected manuscripts. This is a pity since examining the manuscripts is a key part to understanding palaeography.
4,Praise and Shout!,"well I did like this because I love Gospel music and sometimes with a twist and when I heard the preview/premiere song ""I Will"" I jumped on my feet unfortunately it is one of the shortest yet best song on the album. the album is nice but not the best I think the last Kirk Franklin, the last two Israel, as well as Martha Munizzi albums were better"
5,THESE ARE MY BOYS!!!,"I have to be honest and say that Men Of Standards worst album (which was not that bad) was their first one, which was on a different label. I love these guys, because they can really sing, every last one of them can sing lead and that's pretty rare these days. They have had different producers, but they still produce a quality product. The only problem I had with this album is it's too dawg gone short. I recommend this album and all of the ones before it, even the first (so you can appreciate the evolution of these guys)."
3,Seemingly interactive just for the sake of it.,"Celia Pearce's, The Interactive Book, is certainly an interesting and unusual book. The author tries to demonstrate interactivity by having the book written in a non-linear fashion. This book is not for those who are particulary interested in learning about the various topics that are addressed in this book. The contents of the book are certainly not what makes this book for most of the random articles are written in her opinion and personal experiences, nothing too beneficial to the reader. But what does come through to the audience is her idea of allowing every reader to ""choose"" their own unique experience with the book. The format of the book is quite interesting and Pearce does accomplish her task somewhat successfully, but the mere fact that the book offers a different method of reading is not enough to keep the reader ""interactive"" with the book."
3,"A ""choose your own adventure"" book of the future.","This book is a vast overview of all of the subject areas that have been affected by the changing technology. Although the author does not delve into each of these topics, she does a good job of briefly describing them. This book was written with a very personal spin. Ms. Pearce has a tendency to include her opinion in most articles of the book. This book was written much like a ""choose your own adventure"" book from childhood. However, not all of the links are truely connected to the main article. The idea of jumping from piece to piece is an interesting one, but it still needs to be perfected. The Interactive Book is a good attempt at the reading of the future; however, it may have been better off on the web."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Flipping through pages to get bits of information scattered about is more annoying than interactive. It disrupts the flow of information and order. Reading it straight through is fine but when you do that how can it be interactive? What make this book different from any other book ever published? Nothing. The writer claims to be an expert or pioneer in this field yet the irony is in the title of this book! If she truly wanted to make this book interactive, she should have published it on CD-ROM links and all and made the plates in the back of the book interactive."
5,A brilliant book,"Fascinating. The book contextualizes what the interactive revolution is about. How much did I like it? I teach New Media at UCLA Extension and ""The Interactive Book"" is the required text for my new course, ""Fundamentals of New Media for the Entertainment Professional""."
2,Hype,"If you don't know anything about technology before reading this book then be careful -- it conveys a very hyped up view of it (you'll need a serious reality check when you're done). For anyone who IS technically savvy this book will probably be more ""annoying"" then anything else: it constantly tries to draw analogies between technology and other aspects of life that simply don't hold up under any sort of scrutiny."
2,"The title should be: ""The Incoherent Book""","This book poses an interesting type of organization. Instead of reading it linearly, she has you follow links. This provides for a confused reader. The links are somewhat random. They do not mean anything according to the content. They are just there. She covers topics that are somewhat interesting, but for the most part they are dull personalizations. She is talking to you about her experiance and what she thinks about the topics. This is not a reference book. With the price at $40, I don't think this is a wise investment that will help guide you through this revolution. -RM"
4,"Great 1/4"" set for the money",I think this is a great set and has served me well. Ratchet feel and the socket is of very good quality. I have added a univeral adapter to the kit and fits in there with the top still able to close. I would have given it a full five star if it had a universal in the set.
2,Sherpa Patchwork blanket,"This blanket was a disappointment. It will look pretty hanging over the crib as a ""decoration"" but do not think it will be practical for everyday use; don't think it will wash and dry well. The quilted design is attractive. Think it would be better to advertise it as a wall hanging rather than a quilt. Size pretty ""skimpy."" All in all I do not recommend this item."
4,kicked but and was a pleasure for me,"I'm a big fan of Josh Hamilton, but hes not my favorite, hes done movies like The House Of Yes, The Bourne Identity, Urbania and the powerful 1993 Alive, and this part for him is good. it was a pleasure to see some good actors in here and it kicked with its funny moments and charm. Eric Stolz has never been better, Parker Posey is adorable, Olivia d'ABo is awesome, Chris Eigleman is hilarious and Carlos Jacott is uproarous, hes the guy the group asked him if he was wearing masscara and then he said no and then right after he said yes. a keeper"
2,Looks like somebody stayed too long in film school,"I just couldn't care about these just past college 20-somethings, struggling to find themselves while engaging in annoying fake quiz games. There is some gratuitous sex to liven it up a bit, but the dialogue is just too collegiate, the characters far from real and the whole thing seems to lack a point. I had to pause it about 16 times just to get through it."
1,Where's the plot?,"I just saw this movie, and I thought it was terrible! As a college student, I take offense at this ""I-just-graduated-and-I-have-nothing-better-to-do-than-make-out-with-girls-half-my-age"" male flick. The most interesting parts of this pointless film were the recurring flashbacks of the lead character's first encounters with his estranged girlfriend portayed by Olivia d'Abo. Other than that, however, this movie is sorely lacking in interest and character."
2,another college film,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.""Kicking and Screaming"" is about some recently graduated college students who contemplate what to do next. One is interested in moving to Prague, but her boyfriend does not want to join her. Others want to do other things but they don't want to continue their education like one student who is in his 10th year of study.I am not a big fan of college films and did not like this one much either.The special features are a theatrical trailer, deleted scenes, interviews from an IFC feature, new interviews with the cast and crew and the short film ""Conrad and Butler Take a Vacation"".This is a film that not all will like but many will like it."
3,do not turn to this movie if you are suffereing from a quarterlife crisis,"Not to be confused with the Will Farrell flick of the same name, the movie by Noah Baumbach is an attempt at reminiscence of lost love and the misplaced excitement of college life. On paper, this film's premise seems exciting, daring even, but on film Kicking and Screaming is simply another post-college drag. At an hour an a half this movies seems a semester long - as long as it takes the protagonist to realize he can't skip in time - whether backward or forward. This film contains a poignant supporting performance by Eric Stoltz."
3,don't believe the hype,"I normally like Criterion's choices, but I think they made a misstep here. It's a fine line between a Gary Larson cartoon that really works, and one that doesn't quite. Same with films like this. Bottle Rocket, Metropolitan, yes; Kicking and Screaming, no. It just sounds so written, made more so by the direction. You can't linger on quirky lines; we have to get them after we've heard them, not while we're hearing them. And too many scenes have that isn't-this-clever-and-funny feel. And some scenes are, but more aren't. I think."
1,Blah,"It tried to be clever, but it was not. Silly and pretentious, ironically at the same time. Laughed three times."
5,"Deep, rich dialogue and characters -- also very comical","This is one of my personal favorites. This is some of the best dialogue I've ever heard in a film. It's the kind of conversation, being rich in subtext, that goes well beyond the subject being talked about. The characters are rich, deep, and believable. Moreover, the perfomances are fantastic (the two standouts in this film are Chris Eigman as pessimist Max and Carlos Jacot as socially impaired Otis). This is a must see and gets funnier everytime I see it. Hopefully it will be made in the DVD format soon (HINT)."
3,Wind - 'Morning' (Green Tree),"Originally released in 1972, as this was the obscure German 'heavy progressive' band's follow-up to their first record 'Season' (see my review). Probably liked 'Season' better, but tracks on this CD reissue worth mentioning are ""Morning Song"", the rocking ""Princess And The Minstrel"", ""Tommy's Song"" and ""Josephine"". Line-up: Steve Leistner - vocals & percussion, Thomas Leidenberger - guitar & vocals, Andreas Bueler - bass & vocals, Lucian Bueler - keyboards & vocals and Lucky Schmidt - drums, mellotron & piano. Check it out."
3,Cheap,"You get what you pay for, these are no bad but they are certainly not quality gloves. I bought them just to cut the fingers off anyway for fall time hunting."
1,"Debug,debug,debug!","Looked like a cute game. But I never made it past the training mission.And that was after getting some on-line help. Instructions wouldn't open up, couldn't get the training mission to complete--eesch! This is the second game lately with un-debugged problems. Disappointing."
3,"""ESSAYONS""","This game is alot of fun, of course you need to make it through the initial training mission to unlock the rest of the missions. For those getting stuck on the initial training mission, I suggest you down load the manual for the game, it will tell you how to get through it and other missions, that`s what I did. I made it as far as the eighth mission where London is being attacked by waves of V-1`s, but there`s just to many of them for me to handle. If some one can get that far and be successful let me know what you did to beat the V-1`s. Over all this game turned out to be alot of fun and definitely worth the ten buck`s."
2,Sadly Deficient,"This game has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, I can't get past the Training Flight. I successfully complete it, but I only get one mission in the Campaign section. There are suppose to be 16, I believe, but there is no way to unlock them. I'm basing my review on that one mission, which was fun and entertaining. I've visited flight sim forums and have found this to be a very common problem. Unfortunately, no one has come up with a solution. Too bad. This game has a lot of potential. My only hope is Windows 7. I'll try to re-install this game after I install Windows 7 when it comes out October 21."
3,It Could Have Been ...,"YANKS is billed as the epic story of the American Expeditionary Force in France during World War I. Too bad author John Eisenhower didn't tell it.Instead, YANKS gives us General Pershing's war, with lots of time spent covering command decisions and allied conferences. When it covers combat, it rarely goes below division-level.If you're looking for what it was like to be an American Doughboy in France, living in trenches, riding in 40 and 8 cars, you won't find much in YANKS. OTHER PROBLEMS: the research leans heavily on old autobiographies (often self-serving), the air corps and artillery are almost ignored, the role of U. S. black soldiers (assigned to French command) is not even mentioned."
2,Not a very good book,"I felt this book was thrown together from secondary sources, and not well-written. Rather than read this book, I suggest you read The Defeat of Imperial Germany 1917-1918, by Rod Paschall. I found it a much better book, still resonating in my memory over ten years after I finished reading it on 6 April 1991. Unless you are really interested in the various units fighting, the account of those units' various actions and inactions is a drag for one who had no relative in the AEF or is not a wargamer. Incidentally, on page 10 Eisenhower says that on April 6, 1917 the USA was at war with Imperial Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. But I find that the USA did not declare war on Austia-Hungary until Dec 7, 1917. I am curious as to why war was declared on that country at that particular time, and would like to know more about the reason for that particular timing. Since Eisenhower thinks we declared war on Austria-Hungary on Apr 6, you won't find anything about it in this book"
3,WWI AGAIN?,"Nicely written, very readable account of U.S. troops in WWI. Eisenhower balances facts and figures with personal accounts. But do we really need another book about the U.S. army is WWI? This ground has been covered so many times. ""Over There"" by Vaughn, is excellent and was published just last year."
2,oh boy,"john, in your book you mention the ""battle"" of wounded knee. i'm pretty sure they call that infamous blot on the 7th cavalry, and on the american military in general, the ""massacre"" of wounded knee. and also, you didn't mention anything about the fact that the american military in WWI was horribly racist. the US army was so racist in fact that a crack outfit of black troops from harlem (harlem hellfighters ring a bell?) had to be outfitted in FRENCH GEAR before they were allowed to fight!!!when i read a book, i like to get all sides of an issue...the good AND the bad. perhaps you'll keep these suggestions in mind for the 2nd printing."
2,A Disappointment,"In the 'Author's Note' Brigadier General Eisenhower says that ""I have not attempted to give a rounded picture of the whole war,....""The General certainly was true to his word. A superfluous overview is given with a bias of a regular army officer in describing actions of RA units. Like John Pershing, BG Eisenhower exhibits a definite favoritism to the 1st Infantry Division. Were no other US divisions involved?Then again, the maps included are incomplete, leaving much to be desired. The most important map in the book on p.211 is flat out wrong!Finally BG Eisenhower mentions the effects of the Spanish Flu on German troops and the bout that Gen. Pershing suffered. He should have discussed the debilitating effects is had on US troops and the replacement system.Scout the used bookstores for Stallings' ""The Doughboys."" The reader would be better served."
3,"Quality appearance, weak function","I really like the appearance and operation of these tie downs. However the installation method is not positive. The system works by tightening two screws that each pass through a large rubber block. The tightening process causes the rubber block to bow and flex thus putting pressure on the post box that is supposed to hold it in place. The process doesn't pull the unit down to the truck surface so there is some gap underneath. After installation any side or upward pressure may cause the hold downs to work out. I haven't had any actual cargo to tie down as yet but it is obvious that the mounting system is weak. I later found a similar unit at Cabelas that I believe has a more positive mounting method. Overall: very good in appearance and functional operation in locking down and popping up for use, but a very weak mounting system."
2,Don't fit 09 GM,"Even though the PUTCO website has these listed as fitting 2009 GM pickups, they DO NOT fit. The rubber tie down blocks fall right in the hole and are one sixteenth of an inch smaller overall width than the pocket. If the rubber blocks were a quarter of an inch wider, they would work fine."
4,Nice tie down,The worst thing about this product is that it required a little tapping from a dead blow hammer to get it into the hole. Another bad thing is that the square tie down is so large you need a big bail on whatever hook your using to fit. The best thing is that it looks nice and it works great. I bought two and am going to buy another two
5,Great for all,"This book is so easy to use, that i would recomemnd it for anyone, not just children. It has illustrations and very easy directions. I bought this for my first attempt at bread making and it was a great sucess!"
5,What a story.,"What can you expect, another terific story by Juliet. I expect no less from her as she proves time and time again her story telling abilities."
3,A few too many threads - of evil,"This book started out a little more quickly than Daughter of the Forest (Book 1), but wound itself up in too many subplots of bad people doing progressively badder things, and good people turning out to be bad, and lots of unexplained cruelty. There is some sort of resolution, but the character development of one the main characters (Bran, by his alias) is rather shallow.Still, I had to finish it to try to see what in the world prompted some things and how it would all turn out. Mildly satisfying. As with the first book in the trilogy - good for passing the time when flying or waiting in a terminal."
2,Servicable but thinly stretched,"For someone who has never read the folk and fairy tales on which Ms. Marillier's books are based, I guess it would not be impossible to enjoy these books. As someone who loves the lore from which they are derived, however, I think Ms. Marillier is doing a terrible disservice to it.The insular narrative is annoying and somewhat tedious to read. I get the feeling that this material was not really enough to be a book on its own, but as we know in fantasy everything seems to come in threes.This really is a very green author, new to the field and therefore I guess we can give her some slack while she works out her professional chops. But I will be sure to do so in papaerback."
1,VERY POOR CONDITION,"I could not believe that this was sold as good condition, it was in awful condition and smelled terrible. I will never buy from this seller again."
5,Love this book!,"Without a doubt the best book I have read my whole life. The characters are amazing, the events and plot nearly break your heart but with death in this book there is also new life."
5,A Great Sequel,"After reading the previous book, i was very excited to read the next book. I loved the first one and hoped the next one would be just as appealing. I did not expect that SON OF THE SHADOWS would be even better than i expected. The villians in this book were not as open in the first. I did not even suspect them being the ""bad guy"" until they turned on Liadan. Liadan and Bran's love was very intense. I loved this book and i can't wait to read the next one!"
3,"Good, but not great","The only reason I rated this book three stars is because I rated Daughter of the Forest four stars. I really enjoyed Daughter of the Forest despite its length. As usual, Son of Shadows was well-written and in depth, but it lacked the appeal its prequel had. Maybe I just like fairytale renditions, but this book was just not as captivating. I think that Sorcha's and Red's tale was a little ruined; I didn't understand why things had to end the way they did.Liadan's story is great, but it still doesn't match up to her mother's tale. Also, some of the passages are quite boring; there are a couple of really despisable characters.All in all, the storyline was good. If you liked Daughter of the Forest, you should continue with this one."
4,"A good read, interesting folklore",I was reading this while I had bronchitis! It was an easy read and fun to follow the lives of the characters. There were some surprises!
5,We Love the Pajanimals!,"I first saw the Pajanimals on the Sprout Network which my 24 month old loves. She loves them, as do I. I tried to catch them to record on vcr but always messed it up. She sings and dances along with them. I am glad the DVD was available, now I can put her to bed on my schedule not the TV's, it is the only thing she wants to see before turning in!"
5,we love the pajanimals,we love this movie (and tv show). both my sons know all the words to the songs. i love listening to them sing in the car
5,LOVE LOVE!!!!,I purchased this DVD for my 9 month old daughter and she loves it watches it every night before she goes to bed....
3,Too many ads for other shows,We love the Pajanimals around our house so we had to get this DVD after Sprout changed the format on their channel. Our only problem is that there are are two many ads for other DVDs on the disk that you can not not play unless you play each song one at a time by hand. The ads felt like they were as long or longer than the Pajanimals on the disk.
3,Not what I expected,"My 18 month daughter loves the pajanimals! Watching the Pajanimals is part of her bedtime ritual. So when we were planning a vacation, we wanted to make sure she would be comfortable sleeping in a new place. Unfortunately, this does not have the episodes but instead only the songs. Even then, it doesnt sound the same. Wish we could find the episodes!"
1,Only 30 minutes long!,"This DVD was advertised as being ""running time 90 minutes "". Well it was only 30 minutes of actual Pajanimals, the rest were ads for other DVDs. I don't even think with all the ads it is anywhere near 90 minutes!No full episodes. Only a collection of Pajanimal songs."
5,Pajanimals Fan,"I purchased the Pajanimals DVD for my granddaughter. She watches it in the morning when I'm getting her ready for daycare and at night before she goes to sleep. She absolutely loves the Pajanimals songs! She's only 15 months old, but she really enjoys them. I enjoy them as well, and find myself singing along with the songs."
5,"Love, Love, Love",So maybe it reminds me of growing up watching the Muppets but these characters are so adorable and the lullabies are so sweet. My 10 month old sits on my lap and watches them every night before bed and as soon as she sees me turning no the DVD she gets excited. I would recommend this video to anyone. Very sweet.
5,excellent replacement,I crushed the charger that came with my garmin nuvi 260 and a with regular micro USB cable and USB car charger the GPS thought it was plugged into a computer so I gave in and paid the $20 for this. It's essentially the same thing that came with my GPS so I'm very satisfied.
1,It didn't work on my GPS,"My friend purchased one before and it worked fine for her (we both have Garmin Nuvis), but mine simply didn't work. It plugged perfectly into my Garmin and my car but the charge light never came on and it never recharged my GPS. It was only $12 so I'm not to upset, but I don't want to get another one in fear of wasting more money and having the same result."
1,Don't Shop here 0 customer service,Never recieved order but my credit card was charged.They emailed me order was shipped ($5.99) but no tracking number or carrier so I could not follow up. Tried contacting by email no responce. No phone number listed for this company either. Gave up after 4 weeks and bought one from Circut City and recieved it in 3 days. Had 2 give them 1 star to review...should be -1...
1,Garmin Cable,Selling this product is silly when a month later you have no Garmin to use it on since the company can not provide it.
4,Works great - no issues.,Works great - no issues. Would prefer to pay a little more and have no headaches.
3,end cap unscrewed and parts lost,"I bought the Garmin Nuvi for my wife a few months ago. She loves it. As far as I know, she liked the power cable, too. Until today, when the cap unscrewed in the car and all the parts shot out and were lost. So now I'm buying her a new power cable. My rating is based less on it's abiltiy to do the job -- but rather that it no longer does the job. I'm sure this next one will last longer since she'll be aware of the possible problem."
4,Does the job.,"After 2 years, my original power cord no longer worked. Hope this one will last a bit longer. So far as I can tell, it works the same as the original one so I'm glad I got this instead of one of those 4 dollar knock offs everyone was complaining about. But yeah the price was a little higher than I wanted to pay. The GPS only cost me 100 dollars so why does a charger cost almost a 1/4 of the original price?"
4,My Garmin nuvi 660 GPS,I received the GTM 20 FM TCM Traffic receiver with the Garmin 660 GPS system. What about a power cable? Shouldn't I have received that also.
4,Extra Power,Purchased this for my daughter's Garmin (she lost her's). Works like it should except you have to wiggle the power plug at times to get it to charge. The side clips pretrude out of lighter and want to squeeze the plug out. Anyway it works. Would have given a 5 except for that.
1,Does not fit Oregon 400T,"This item was originally listed to fit The Garmin Oregon 400T handheld GPS. When I got it and tried to use it, it doesn't work for that model of GPS. The right angle of the plug hits the curved body of the Oregon model so the plug does not engage all the way and won't stay in. The plug needs to be reversed 90 degrees to work for the Oregon GPS model. When I attemped to return it, the seller has a $10 return fee plus shipping, so I am stuck with it, since that adds up to about 75% of what I paid for it. Now I see they have now listed a different model for the Oregon GPS. Figures."
5,Power Adapter great - just like original,"I needed a second power adapter for my Garmin navigation unit, since I use it in 2 different cars, and didn't want to undo and remove the adapter I installed in my primary car. This second adaptor is as good as the factory unit and serves my purpose quite well, not to mention that the Garmin NUVI navigator is the greatest thing since sliced bread!!"
1,I was charged for this item and it was never shipped,"I was charged for this item and it was never shipped,I contacted the company and they blew me off. It is imposible to contact these people by telephone. I will probably not buy anything through Amazon again. John Kelley"
4,Get a Gamin,"This was a replacement for the cheaper off brand. Suffice it to say it pays to buy this first, save the money - buy this. The cheaper one's slipped out of jack, and overheated the GPS."
1,in correct item delivered,"How can I rate this item when i didnt recieve this item?Why bother? Reason being, is wheni 1st received the cable, i imediately wrote to Amazon as well as the dealer, and I never received a respone back. it is highly unlikely that i will purchase another item from Amazon. If i can not get a simple cable as avertised correct, how would i have any confidence that i will receive a more costly item correct and be stuck for a larger bill and remain unsatisfied?"
3,deceptive advertising / good product,Amazon advertised this product with the garmin nuvi in such a way that the you are led to believe you must have this power cable to operate your Garmin Nuvi in your car. Wrong. Nuvi comes with this adapter and you really dont need the extra one. Shame on amazon.com for misleading advertising.
1,They Frequently fall apart!!,"I have a Garmin 760 GPS and the power cord has fallen apart twice. Once on my motorcycle it cost me almost two hundred dollars. The ""button"" on the very tip had fallen off. I never noticed and plugged in the GPS. Later as I was traveling down the road I noticed I had no brake lights or turn signals. I was out of town so I took my bike to the nearest dealer who spent two hours trouble shooting. Then misdiagnosed the problem as crimped wires. Charged me and sent me down the road where within minutes it shorted out the turn signals and brake light again. Long story short.....keep an eye on the end piece that screws on. It loosens frequently. If you find the parts you can put ir back together, if not you buy another."
1,Unneeded Item,"If you buy the nuvi 275T new, it comes with an auto plug-in that also has the FM receiver. No need for this extra plug unless you want a back-up."
5,Works great with nuvi 265WT,"Great bargain! Received charger from Amazon within a few days, shipping was free, and it works just fine. Much better deal than buying from a big box store."
2,Think again,I have tried this in any number of different vehicles and have the same problem every time: It does not want to stay plugged in.
2,"I ordered this item, but I have got the other product.","Accually, I ordered it, but they sent the other one.However, I have just used it, because it is difficult to resend and it takes many days."
3,Unnecessary Accessory,"I purchased this item only because other reviews said it was necessary. The perceived problem was that the adapter included with the Nuvi 350 was not substantial and that it broke easily. In fact, this is the very same DC adapter that came with the unit. This accessory is not required."
2,"Adapter works, but plastic tip is fragile",I had this as it came with my nuvi 350. Worked fine for a few months and then one day the plastic tip broke off. Appears the heat stress got to it and it breaks very easily. Friend with an identical unit did the same thing.Fortunately mine was still under warranty and Garmin replaced it at no cost. The replacement appears to be MUCH better than original one. The tip is all metal now and not prone to breakage like the other one.
3,NOT recommended for the Garmin Nuvi 660 -- get model # 010-10747-03 instead,"This is the vehicle charger recommended on the amazon.com Garmin Nuvi 660 product page, but it is not the correct model for it. Get the Garmin vehicle charger (model # 010-10747-03) instead -- also available here at amazon.com through this link:Garmin 12-Volt Vehicle DC Power Adapter for the StreetPilot C510 and C550 (010-10747-03)."
1,didn't last long,"I bought this Garmin nüvi power cable because it was cheap. It was cheap for a reason. The cable worked for a few weeks, then the part that fits into the ""cigarette lighter"" hole fell apart. That was the end of it."
4,Had to replace my orginal cable,This one is better than the original power cable that came with my Garmin nuvi - 360.One of the parts of original power cable was lost during the road trip. So I had to order new one. This one looks better and works well. It was little pricey though.
1,Poor advertisement on Amazon,It would have been really great if the ad for the Garmin 350 had better displayed the fact that the GPS had a 12vdc power cable with the unit. Now I have two and I damn sure don't need two with one GPS. Who whats it?Unhappy
1,Falls apart,"This is the third cord that I have ordered for my Nuvi, and it too has fallen apart. I would not recommend this product or the Garmin Nuvi. I've also had to replace the suction component that holds it to the windshield. I've only had the Nuvi 1.5 years."
2,Third party Nuvi Vehicle Power Cable,"This power cable is called a Garmin Nuvi power cable, but is not like the original supplied with the GPS, nor is like the one in the illustration. The cable is a little shorter. It is long enough if I relocate the GPS. It does not have the nodule in series in the line as on the original. I don't know the function of the nodule, but the current setup seems to work different. It seems that it takes longer to load the maps. It seems that I get the message ""low battery"" more frequently. I also lost all my recorded addresses for some unknown reason. It is marked as a CyonGear, PMOTV3D. (made in China). It is not Garmin. It works, but with above limitations.Delivery was prompt."
1,GPS Nuvi Power cord Car charger,"Tip of car charger gets loose too easily, made in China. Bad experience, would disuade buying Nuvi products. I am asking for 2X $26 refund and apology on 2 of my 3 GPS Nuvi product bought in 18 months."
5,great purchase so far,"We have only used the GPS and adapter a few times, but are anticipating a lengthy trip to Florida soon. I am sure this will help a great deal."
1,charger,"not as described, needed to replace mine that was in my luggage stolen from Fort Lauderdale airport, a different charger was sent."
5,no problems,it's worked and worked well the whole two years I've had it. Nothing else to say. It's just a very good product.
2,auto charger not the one pictured,"The plug-in Nuvi automobile charger/power unit I obtained certainly performs electronically as intended. It does not, however match the unit pictured here by Amazon. Instead, the plug-in end is about 5-inches long and straight, much like a cigar. In that configuration (rather than the stubbler one shown), the unit and its wire project further into the cabin than would otherwise be the case, and that cramps the space around my shift lever. Since I drive a standard transmission car (1999 BMW Z-3 Coupe), that presents more of an issue (and more frequently) than it would in a car with an automatic transmission."
1,Mis- leading description and compatibility for Nuvi 760,"The EXACT thing happened to me today. I ordered the charger because it was advertised with the 760 unit, and the minute I got it today, I noticed the incompatability. I too have to return and order what I really need. Unfortunate;y it probably won't arrive before I need it on Monday. (5/11)"
3,Power Cable,"I bought this item because the description ""What's in the box"" did not include an automobile power cable for the Garmin 265WT GPS unit. I checked both the Garmin website and the Amazon description. It turns out this item was not needed as it ""was"" included with the GPS unit. I didn't return it as it arrived first ahead of the GPS unit itself and I opened the package. (The packaging was destroyed.) I'm sure its okay although not needed. I wasted my money. I blame Garmin and not Amazon."
5,Great Product.,Excellent-had to give my son my old to take to CA so this replacment is just like the one I had and it works great.
4,power cable,I sent it back because I didn't know one would come with my garmin. It was listed in items I might also need.
1,Never got the item--no response to email inquiry.,"Hard to review product when you never get it. Order made on Dec 4. Was advised delivery was to be as late as Dec 28, which is rediculous (most purchases arrive within a week of order). Even that date has come and gone over 2 weeks ago. No reply from shipper to email inquiry. I wish someone would contact me and tell me if I have been ripped off or just what's up."
5,As good as the original,I was pleased with the part I ordered for my Garmin. It was exactly as pictured and as described. I would not hesitate to order again if the need ever arises.
3,Good when it stays connected,In general it is fine but it does not stay connected well. It is not falling out all the time but I have had to reseat/replug it several times during a 17 hour car ride when I noticed it was not receiving power.
3,garmin nuvu vehicle power cable,"I ORDERED ONE, YOU SENT TWO, I DID NOT NEED ONE AT ALL AS ONE CAME WITH NUVU BUT DID NOT SAY SO ON DESCRIPTION AT AMAZON. I SENT THE TWO BACK AND ONLY RECIEVED CREDIT FOR ONE. PLEASE CHECK ON THIS. I JUST GOT MY VISA BILL YESTERDAY AND FOUND THE ERROR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP IN THIS MATTER.THE NUVU AND CAS IS A CHRISTMAS GIFT AND WILL BE GLAD TO REVIEW THEM AFTER THEY ARE RECEIVED.THANK YOU KATHLEEN HARRIS172 STRATFORD PL.DANVILLE, VA 24541"
4,Suction mount.,"Product works well except when it gets real cold. It will let go of the windshield when it is below 40 degrees. It will go back on again, it's just a pain to get it to stay."
2,Works OK,"I did not have to buy this item as it came with the GPS. However, it works exactly as it should."
1,Can't rate it because I couldn't use it!,"Your site said this fit Garmin nuvi GPS Navigators. When it arrived, the connection to the GPS was not correct for our 760 Garmin nuvi. I sent it back, however among the reasons to choose from, the ""ordered in error"" seemed to fit the situation. I received the return label kit, returned the unit, but because I had said ""ordered in error"" was not credited with the return postage. It is not configured to fit the power inlet on 760 nuvi Navigators, though the description just said ""Garmin Vehicle Power Cable for nuvi Portable GPS Navigators"" This needs to be corrected."
4,Good product,I purchased this charger as a replacement part and I have had no issues or complaints about using it. Easy to use and very reliable.
5,It works,I have a very old model of the Nuvi and has misplaced the charger cord. For a while I was getting by with using a data cord for a digital camera to charge it on my laptop but this is not an option for long trips because the data cord won't allow me to use it while it's charging. I thought that my Nuvi was defective. I tried this cord and I'm glad I didn't just get a new Nuvi instead. Saved me a lot of money.
2,Amazon shipped the wrong product,"Amazon sent me the wrong product and the restocking fee and shipping mean I would be better off to try and sell it on craigslist.These cables are highly overpriced.It looks like a normal mini-usb connector on the Nuvi, but my mini-usb cell phone charger does not work, so Garmin is using a proprietary mini-usb adapter."
4,Works with Nuvi 350,"Works fine with Garmin Nuvi 350. Pretty nice flexible cable. Ninety degree angle plug works well when mount is on windshield to attach to mount, which makes it quicker to remove Nuvi to take it out of car."
5,Garmin Vehicle Power Cable for nüvi Portable GPS Navigators (010-10723-06),Received as promised and will not be used since one of the same came in the box with my unit. The item is as shown online.
2,75 cents more for frustration free packaging????,"so...it's the SAME item, just in a different ""frustration free"" package, so it costs 75 cents more???? REALLY????? R E A L L Y???????It's called a knife. It's called scisors. It removes the frustration in any packaging."
1,Don't buy it,"I bought this cable because it was recommended by Amazon in a package to supplement the Garmin GPS. It isn't necessary, as there is already one that comes with the GPS. Now they want to charge me to return it because they say it was my fault for buying it. Ripoff?"
4,Garmin Vehicle Power Cable,"Garmin Vehicle Power Cable for nüvi Portable GPS Navigators (010-10723-06)This power cable is quite a bit better than the one that was supplied with the unit in the box. The power adapter that came with the nuvi seemed to be cheaply made. For example, it had plastic tabs to grab the inside of the power supply socket. THIS power cable actually has metal tabs that does the job much better. Also, the LED light on the new cable is more subdued whereas the LED on the supplied cable was much brighter, so much so, that at times, I actually turned the adapter down so that the light wouldn't be so noticable. The only complaint that I would have is the cable is somewhat stiff. The cable on the supplied unit was more pliable and manageable. (It could be that the cable on the new adapter is actually made with a heavier wire, therefore, as a result, stiffer.) However, it is one that I would buy again. Certainly an improvement over the supplied cable."
2,Fairly good accessory,The traffic antenna/charger I got for my Garmin Nuvi 760 died (actually the electrical connection fell apart inside my cigarette lighter socket) so I needed a power supply. This one works for the most part. As with a lot of after-market accessories this one has a less than precise fit to the Nuvi. As a consequence I will occasionally have to reach up and push the USB connector back into the Nuvi. That makes this just an OK accessory. Garmin's own charger cable is a lot more expensive but a bit more reliable in terms of fit to its devies so if you only occasionally rely on a GPS this one works just fine.
1,Dont buy,"I bought the charger for my Nuvi350. When I connected in the car charge holder, the gps resets to the home page (ie) keep on stay in loading maps. If I disconnected from charging, the gps started to work as expected(I could see the navigation screen). Please stay away from this product."
5,Great Product,"This is a newer version than what came with the initial purchase. Works great, no problems, excellent price!"
3,Not what I wanted but it works,I ordered this because the prong on my was bent. I have learned to only order things that come directly from Amazon. What I got is not what I ordered and is not what was pictured. What was pictured on the box is the cord with the little transmitter thingy so that I am able to get the traffic reports but that is not what is got. Don't have the time energy or money to look for the right one but it does charge my Garmin
1,Garmin Vehicle Power Cable,I think it's a crime for Amazon to sell this cable without noting the full Garmin set had already cable in that package. One who wants to buy this item should be one who already lost or needed even if he had a cable.
1,Vender conveniently ignores customer cancelation,"Two days after I mistakenly purchased this vehicle power cable, not realizing that the Garmin GPS I had purchased came with a power cable, I received an email from the vender that the item was not in stock and would not ship until a new shipment came in, The email invited communications from the purchaser. Dispite the fact that I responded to the vendor email cancelling the order, the vendor ignored my cancelation of the order and sent out the item. In addition, despite the fact that I have twice subsequently attempted to communicate my problem to the vender, once in a previous evaluation and once to my credit card company, challenging the purchase indicating that if the vendor would agree to pay for the return, I would send the item back, I have yet to receive even so much as an acknowledgment from the vendor. I would give this vendor a zero stars rating if that was available and would never use this vendor again."
1,Unnecessary product but recommended by Amazom,The car charger actually come with the box. as I never buy Garmin before and it is recommended by Amazon so I bought it. I found that the one come with the box is more useful as it is connect to the unit that come with Garmin too. This charger has to connect to Garmin's USB port itself and you have to plug/remove it everytime if you want to take your Garmin out of the car.
1,Nuvi vehicle power cable,Unnecessary to buy this separately. One comes with each Nuvi GPS system. The Amazaon site does not adequately explain this.
3,Disappointment,Never received it. You delivered only additions to it (which are useless without it) but not the receiver
1,Poor product,Overall this is a very poor product. The first one I purchased broke after six months. The second unit I purchased did not work from the beginning.
5,Good honest and safe purchase,This item was great and like the original one. This purchase was honest and safe.Thank you
5,MY GARMIN,"THIS IS A HIGHT SELLER RECOMENDATION, I NEVER THINKS BUY THIS CABLE QUALITY, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING, I WILL GIVE 5 STARS AT THIS SELLER & ITEM EVENTUALLY."
1,could not return Garmin Vehicle Power Cable,"Did not know that vehicle power cable came with the Garmin Nuvi. No additional parts were pictured with the Nuvi. A vehicle cable (for sale), was pictured next to garmin nuvi suggesting it needed to be ordered separately. When nuvi arrived a cable was part of package. Seller of separate cable that I ordered, when contacted, said I could not return the duplicate. Needless to say, I was not very happy about that!"
1,Broken after first use!,"This charger seemed like it fit the bill, however the plug fit very tightly to my Garmin Nuvi 255. After our trip, removing the plug from the back of the Garmin unit resulted in a broken charger, plastic housing fell off, and the metal tip is still stuck in the Garmin! Removing this will inevitably involve pliers... Unfortunately, I believe the charger is now shot. Hopefully the Garmin is okay!"
2,"Kind of Works, but loses connection often",This is the second DC Adapter I've purchased from Amazon. I had to return the first one because it didn't fit well into a number of DC power plugs in my vehichles and would not keep a constant source of power to my Garmin GPS unit. The second adpater was a replacement and it does not work much better. It seems like the plug is just slightly smaller than what it should be to create a snug / constant fit when plugged in. Tried in multiple vehicles (3) so I don't think its my cars causing the problem. Will have to live with the connection losing power at times I guess (frustrating).
2,Garmin Vehicle DC Power Adapter,"This is not the most sturdy implement, but one that is quite necessary. The one that came with my unit burned out within 3 months and stopped working, forcing me to purchase a replacement. I move between cars quite frequently, so I don't know if that had anything to do with it."
2,Poorly designed but essential,"This is the same car adapter that is supplied with the Nuvi 370, so there is no need to purchase it separately unless you've lost yours or need a spare. Although it works just fine (and why shouldn't it, it's just a DC adapter?), the black plastic used to wrap the wire is not sufficiently pliable. It is unnecessarily stiff, especially when it is cold. As a result the cord often gets in the way. And the end that fits into the nav unit is at a fixed 90 degreee angle, so unless you are using the suction cup (illegal in at least two states) or the friction fit, the design of the cord means that the nav unit cannot lie flat. These are two very annoying design elements that have no place, in my opinion, with a fine product like the Nuvi 370. It appears to me that they tried to cut corners somewhere, and this DC adapter seems to have been the place.My"
4,Works,"On the pricey side, but it works. I have a universal charger that fits in my Nuvi, but the Nuvi will not charge. I wish I could use it instead to minimize the number of cables I have to bring along when traveling."
1,Power cable is stiff as a board,"First of all this charger is included with your GPS Unit. The cable is stiff as a board and creates a problem during use. It is not flexible like a cell phone charging cord. I live in Michigan so in the winter it is even more of a problem. I complained to Garmin and all they did was to send me a replacement power cable that was just as stiff as the origional. They do not recognize that although the cable works, it is a pain in the [...]."
2,Don't get this unless you have two cars,"Each Garmin Nuvi comes with its own DC cord. So unless you have 2 cars that you will be using the GPS in, don't buy this extra one.Atlibrary"
2,You do not need this if you purchase a brand new GPS Unit,All Brand New units come with this cable. Do not be tricked by the Amazon bundle package which leads you to believe this is not in the original box. Save yourself a headache and the darn return freight.
3,Great performer,"Don't get me wrong, I think the cord is fantastic. Really helps to have this when I want to take my Nuvi in another car since mine is practically hard wired in my truck. So why the 3 stars? The price is absolutely absurd. This this is the same glorified cell phone charger that you can find on eBay for $5, but of course it being Garmin, they have to squeeze you for $30 and that I don't find to be a good value, but I needed it so thems the breaks..."
1,lousy,Worked for about two weeks then nothing. Checked both ends for good connection but still no power through it. Put my old one back on that I use on my motorcycle and device works fine. So I put the new back in and wiggled the plug end of the wire and was able to get power if I held the wire to one side. Junk!!
1,Sub-Standard Cable,"I purchased this item to use in my 2008 Chevy Malibu. It fit loosely in my lighter, and shorted in & out. After about 1 month of frustrated usage, it stopped working completely. The problem was in the cigarette cartridge of the cable. I wanted a brand name cable over a generic but found this product to be substandard, like buying a fake Gucci purse off the streets. Luckily, I recently was able to trade in my old Garmin for a new one, getting a $50 rebate at the Chicago Garmin store. My new Garmin came with new power cable."
5,Just great,Just what we wanted. This is a spare one for in our truck and it is always good to have a spare just in case as I broke one on a long road trip and we were really stuck. So always carry a spare now.
5,Works great for Garmin Nuvi 1350 GPS,This is a great cheaper replacement of the original charger. It works perfectly and the connector wire looks pretty sturdy.
5,Garmin Vehicle Power Cable for nüvi Portable GPS Navigators (010-10723-06),Garmin Vehicle Power Cable for nüvi Portable GPS Navigators (010-10723-06) WORKS GREAT GREAT PRICE FAST SHIPPING.
5,Good,The product was received in fine condition but I returned it because it wasn't needed after all.
1,Not Compatible with Nuvi 760,This product had to be returned as it was not compatible with the Nuvi 760 although it was advertised as such and I had to pay return postage.
1,Not work in my car lighter,"All other appliances have worked in my 2006 Hyundai, but not this one. Had to return it to Amazon for a refund"
2,Breaks easily,"This looks like the charger that came originally with my Garmin Nuvi 350. Mine broke in a few months. I kept it in the car at all times and once I wanted to use it and the part that plugs in the cigarette lighter was just split in two. I never dropped, forced, beat or in anyway mistreated the product. I suspect it broke due to hot weather.I recommend you not buy this item."
5,Clint Estwood The Great Actor,"In short Eastwood does a great job and makes good movies and very good acting. The Enforcer I seen on the big screen was very very good.I have seen all of his movies all the way back to TV shows Rawhide 1959-1965.I know a movie does not pleas too very ones like.some movies are no good or just bad. I know the movies i see that the next person does not like and etc.Back to the Enforcer is a good one give it a look, and see if you like it or not.One movie that Clint as a actor called Thunderbolt and Light Foot is a funny and good action.In this movie there other good actors like young Jeff Bridges. In fact the movie was made were I live at. You can see all the actors and inf on IMDB. I love IMDB inf on all movies, actors, and clipsthank you.PS. a movie a day keep's the Doc away. lol"
2,no biggie,"I love watching great fights w/ wicked strikes, blood, drama, and knockouts. A few of the fights were mildly entertaining but nothing worth the purchase. If you're a collector of mano e mano brawls on DVD then by all means add this to your collection. However if you're relatively new to full contact fighting you might get frustrated w/ the mostly ground based jujitsu-style techniques employed throughout this particular tournament."
5,Lifts your educator spirits!,"Some people might read this great Dr. Seuss book and say,""See, testing is bad."" My take is that rigorous, student affirming education comes in many forms. Some students need the discipline provided at the school across the street to achieve, others need to be set free-- inspired by brilliant creative teachers who teach a rigorous curriculum at the same time as stimulating students' creativity. We need both! But, most of all we need wonderful teachers who know how to teach the highest standards with an insightful focus on students' individual learning styles. Long live Dr. Seuss and brilliant learning! Love this book! Never teach to the test-- teach beyond it!"
2,Quality not as promised,"This book had folded and torn corners and was DIRTY. Cover had to be cleaned in order to handle it. Looked like there was mud or melted chocolate melted on the cover. Requested a book in good condition, and it was not."
1,"Appendix is great, book is not so good.","This is a book that is suppossed to be written in the Suess style, but totally fails in its mission. The illustrations are abysmal, the rhymes contrived. The lessons/morals - Well I do not know if I want to show a school principal looking up the dress of a female teacher?"
1,a big disappointment,"My kids loved Smith's illustrations for the True Story of the Three Little Pigs, Stinky Cheese Man, etc. And Prelutsky has been a favorite for years. But this combination on this title did NOT work.My kids thought it was boring, and preachy. I thought the same, but as well, it bashes one style of education to promote another. There are times when people NEED rote memorization, as well as innovative concepts. Saying only one or the other is valid is not only untrue, but promotes intolerance.For heaven's sake, let the good Dr rest in peace!"
5,Great story,"Item was in perfect condition, and I am happy to add it to my collection for my future classroom once I become a teacher!"
5,I can't wait for class and every test I would pass!,"I intend to purchase this book! I can't do it online, but I will get it at a ""regular"" bookstore. The book is about individuality and not trying to dress alike or everyone try to ""look alike"". At school, everyone feels as if they have to wear the latest ""trendy"" outfit to be in the ""in group"". I am not like that. Okay, so the book isn't all about dressing different, but about a teacher who likes to be a different teacher from traditional teaching and not conform to all teaching ""rules"". Miss Bonkers makes all learning fun and is a teacher who I would love to have too! This book points out that it is cool to be yourself!"
5,Kids and Parents will enjoy this one!,I have read this book to my kids since they were infants. Now they are 2 yrs old and they still love it. It is long but it always keeps their attention. It is fun and the song at the end is great!
5,I use this when I speak at graduation ceremonies for teachers.,"Thinking out of the box....the true legacy of Dr. Seuss. Not one way of teaching - but multiple ways of teaching to excite a child and have them truly enjoy learning. A great teacher goes beyond teaching to a minimal state test. A great teacher teachers their students ""to think."" Our children are not robots and one size never fits all. I am a clinical faculty member working with teachers in a teacher preparation program which trains teachers to be ""diffendooferous"" and to always grow, learn, and think out of the box for the benefit of their students. This book is a perfect way to sum up the experience. I have even animated a PowerPoint presentation to go with this dynamic reading which is a big hit at our graduation ceremony each semester. Thank you for this wonderful book."
1,"Don't buy, wait for Criterion version","[star rating above is for DVD only; movie itself = *****] director Gillo Pontecorvo's 'The Battle Of Algiers' has already been released by The Criterion Collection in an exemplary 3-disc edition - as mentioned by another reviewer, 'Queimada' (Burn!) [...] was also previously released as a Criterion laserdisc.Given that the transfer here is non-anamorphic 1.66:1, and that the film presented is English-language 112-minute version - not the 132-minute Italian-language director's cut which was screened selectively in the U.S. last year - let's all wait for BOTH the English and original Italian versions to be released as a Criterion edition (as they did with Visconti's Il Gattopardo - The Leopard, on 3 discs).Please send Sony/Columbia/Tristar/MGM (whoever the ^@~& they are this week) a clear message by not purchasing this disc."
1,Ditto -- full version or nothing,"The full, restored version of this film, which I saw theatrically last year, is a brilliant piece of political filmmaking and very, very exciting -- one of the very few films Pontecorvo directed, and probably the biggest in scope (THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS and THE WIDE BLUE ROAD are two others, and also worth seeing). The film deals with colonialism -- it could have been written by Fanon, for how radical it is. It's also presented in Italian, with Brando's part dubbed (but not as badly as you would expect) into that language. If this version were released on DVD, I would buy it promptly. A truncated, dubbed, pan and scan version? What the hell do these people think DVD buffs are ABOUT, anyhow? MGM can go shove, until they get serious."
4,my two cents,"Regarding the aspect ratio of this film...in response to the other reviews I would like to add that this is not a 4:3 version. It is 1:66:1 which was a fairly common aspect ratio for its day. I can't say if a wider version exists or if this is correct as this is the only version I have seen. 4:3 translates to 1.33:1...so this is not 4:3. You will notice that the black bars on each side are thinner than if you were watching broadcast non-HD programming which is presented in 4:3 (or 1.33:1) aspect ratio. Widescreen 16:9 which is what our new widescreen televisions display translates to 1.78:1. 1.83:1 would mean black bars top and bottom, even on a widescreen tv. Please correct me if I am wrong.All that being said I though this was an excellent movie although I agree MGM could have done a much better job with the negative."
5,A Masterpiece,"If you have not seen it before, you should. It is among the best five movies of Brando where Brando offers a fine and nobel performance. I strongly recommend the movie...."
3,Burn! The Definitive Word,"The 132 minute version on DVD is not a reality to my knowledge, even the Italian DVD is slightly truncated at 124 minutes.This DVD is however, the version that most Americans know, and it is perhaps a worthy version onto its own, apart from the 134 minute version. Unfortunately, this DVD is not in its original aspect ratio, but rather pan and scan/fullscreen.Burn! was released by Criterion Collection on the laserdisc format way back in 1991 in it's American 112 minute version in widescreen original aspect ratio. To my knowledge, this remains the definitive version of Burn!.Hopefully, we will see a DVD with both the American version, Burn!, and original version, Queimada in their original aspect ratio soon. This DVD is not acceptable unfortunately for fans, but for those who have not seen Burn!, I must recommend watching this DVD for the sheer quality of the film. Not to be missed."
3,Widescreen Fraud,"Were it possible to sue MGM for the breaching the trade descriptions acts, I would promptly do so. The box states that this is a 1.66:1 widescreen DVD. However, this is clearly NOT the original aspect ratio of the negative. Anyone looking at the framing, with even a passing awareness of composition, colour, and perspective, can easily see that this is a 1.85:1 negative strangely cropped, or pan and scanned, to 1.66:1.One wonders why they don't have the sense or means to release the correct aspect ratio, or even the recently restored full length version, rather than this inferior version!!!???I've given it 3 out of 5 because it's a wonderful movie. I would have made it 5, had MGM given it some care and attention. Let's hope that more intelligent distributors like Criterion get a chance to release a better version, and give this fantastic film the respect it deserves."
2,Poor Quality and Edited!,"Three complaints about this DVD sum up my review:First, we've got the short, 112 minute version as opposed to the uncut original 132 minute version.Second, the negative is in terrible shape. If you've seen any of those public domain DVDs of spaghetti westerns and such, you know exactly what I am talking about. Washed out colors, grain, scratches, the whole deal. Yuck.Third, and least important, there are no special features on this disc - not even a trailer.SHAME ON YOU MGM!!!"
5,DVD Burn,"Marlon Brando called this his ""best work"" when interviewed ayear before he died. excellent acting . very enjoyable. firstsaw the movie in Monterrey, Mexico with spanish subtitles.great movie."
2,dull,"I ended up fast-forwarding through most of this film. Brando apparently likes this performance among his best, but I think his performance is contrived. I know someone who worked on the film, and have read Brando's comments about the filming, and what happened off screen sounds more exciting than what you see on screen."
3,the fit is weird,"Got this for my Daughter for christmas, it's pretty thin and the fit is really strange. I got her a Medium, (she's 7) and it has elastic in the back of the skirt and pulls the front and makes it look odd. Also the sleeves are only attached by velcro and don't stay on well. I'm willing to add snaps or stitch them on completely though. I might even loosen the elastic in the back to make it fit nicer. it just looks odd on."
5,Phenomal Music Collection,"I did not know most of the artists and questioned the musical insights of actor/director Mel Gibson (who co-produced this CD), but something persuaded me to purchase The Passion of The Christ: Songs Inspired By. This is my favorite CD and I continue to play it repeatedly during this holy time of advent. The extraordinary spiritual depth and the artistic rendition of each song is beyond my greatest expectations. The music is fresh, yet timeless, and has helped me in delving deeper into the contemplation of the life of Jesus Christ. Who would think that Mel Gibson could compile such a gem in yet another genre."
4,"Hauntingly beautiful, but.....","I received this CD as a gift and it has been on my stereo for the last week. This is the kind of sweet and surreal music that lingers with you afterwards...insisting to be played again.One quibble though. My favorite song on the CD was ""Darker with the Day"" and I had difficulty understanding all the lyrics.I Googled the lyrics on several sites only to find the lyrics and...well, let's just say I was more than a bit dissappointed to find a pretty offensive word buried in the song. I have to take at least one star off for that, but it's still lovely, thought provoking music."
1,"""INSPIRED"" by the movie?","Historical accuracy may or may not take a beating in the Gibson film, but it sure does in the marketing of this CD --- how can songs recorded, in some cases, years ago be ""inspired by"" this film? And while I have no trouble believing that Bob (""I want a new audience, so I'll do a Victoria's Secret commercial"") Dylan gave permission for his song to be included, I cannot imagine Leonard Cohen signing off on this. Yes, Cohen's work is largely about the quest for the divine, but it is hard to square his Talmudic Zen Buddhism with the absolutism of Gibson's message. Buyer, beware....."
2,The Passion of Jesus Christ,"The soundtrack for The Passion Of The Christ is 5 stars, if you are going to like Songs Inspired by the Passion you will have to like that type of music. The messages in the songs were OK, the singers are my like of music."
1,Skip This Passion,"This is the worst CD I have ever heard and I am dumbfounded that Mel Gibson permitted his name or film to even be associated with it! I would give the movie 5 stars and enjoyed the original soundtrack but this is an unrelated bit of moaning, screeching and awful noise. Listen to the tracks before you put down your money or better... just skip it. It is truly terrible. For ""inspired"" vocals check out Josh Groban's newest ""Closer"" or anything by Anonymous 4 (la bele marie is good). I liked Nichole Nordeman's ""Woven and Spun"" and Lamb III (their best album) which actually puts scriptures to song, a few entirely in Hebrew. Catholic Marian Classics Vol VI is uplifting choral. Any of these would be better choices!"
1,not the music of the movie,hi i saw the movie this is not the music from the movie. i would like to buy it but this isn`t it.
5,not the sound track,"Everybody's complaining that these songs are old and that the artists wrote the songs long before the Passion of the Christ movie was released. I'm 37 years old and am thankful to have been exposed for the first time to the music of Leon Russell, Jessi Colter, The Ghost Who Walks, Leonard Cohen, etc. I've heard the Blind Boys of Alabama before and even purchased their Christmas Album, which I highly recommend. Amazing, simply amazing. I loved this CD. Such a refreshing soulish, bluesy escape from the noise that's on the radio these days, in secular AND contemporary Christian music. Thanks Mel Gibson for bringing these talented artists to our attention. Yes, somewhere post MTV and good looks radio, there are still a few people making good music out there and some of them are on this CD. Don't mistake this for the sound track though; it's a totally different genre."
3,Not the Best,"This wig is not the biggest, and definatly not really worth the money I paid to get it. Although my sister loved it, it is not very durable. It is just a latex wig and it really doesn't even deserve 3 stars, especially be took cause of the long time it took to get here."
4,Great Read,"This book goes through all the history of bourbon from the very beginning up to now. It is a easy read with lots of details, but not so much that the reader gets lost."
5,knowing bourbon,"Is a great book on the how, who, what and when of bourbon. Tells history, how its made (best I have seen in easy terms) who did what and how to really enjoy bourbon. Then on top of all that is a very open and honest look at drinking."
4,Simply Seasonal Fun!,"I have had the cassette version of this album for years and was so pleased to locate a CD version prior to the holiday season! It is a wonderful mix of the religious and the secular music that is perfect for listening pleasure. Local radio stations play the same holiday numbers over and over, but they forget the fun of hearing ""Grandma got run..."" possibly for political correctness. I want to enjoy ""classics"" both serious and comical and let me decide. Thanks for helping make the season a bit brighter!"
1,WORST BOOK EVER!!!!!,"A sheep farmer seeks Nancy's help in deciphering some pictures painted on a parchment after receiving an anonymous phone call that it would right a great wrong. This is without a doubt the worst book that I have ever read. No mystery, no action, no suspence. The phone book is classic literature compared to this book. The book is just boring, boring, boring. For God sake, the bad guy is arrested while sitting on his living room couch and he never actually does anything to hinder Nancy's investigation other than be unpleasant to her. I bet that ending must have taken days of thought and careful planning to achieve. The only person I'd recommend this book to is a child that is constantly complaining that she/he is bored. After reading this book, she/he would know what true boredom really is."
1,Worst in the set,"Without a doubt this was THE worst book in the series. Downright boring. No mystery, no action, no nothing. This book does not even deserve a point 1 rating let alone a 1."
5,A Reveiw of the Italian Painting book,It is very well written with many pictures of Italian paintings. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who likes art.
2,A disappointing addition,"If you've heard City Life: Underground New York (vol. 1) or London (vol. 2) - you may be disappointed in the musical shift that Florence takes.While London maintained a brighter house thematic, and New York followed a more intriguing, sometimes mysterious, jazzy feel, Florence's tracks are repetetive, droning, and uninviting.The 3rd City Life volume is mostly progressive house that seems to lack any musical 'soul'. Don't expect much in that way of instrumentals or notable lyrics. It's droning, muffled beats sound like the bass was drowned underwater.The only noteworthy songs on the entire album are 'Soulheaven' and 'We Are Together' - unfortunately, compared to the two City Life predecessors, even these are mediocre at best."
5,Vivid Imagery/Compelling Story,I just finished Year of the Smoke Girl and I am still savoring the intense pictures it created in my mind. It was a great read and I'm feeling the sadness that comes at the end of reading a really good novel. I look forward to reading more from this talented young author.
4,Handy Reference for Parents,"This book is a great easy-to-read guide for parents- especially new or young parents who may be inexperienced with childrearing. The book is written in simple, easy-to-follow language and presents concrete examples to handle real-life situations. This is a great gift for new parents; they will refer to the book time and again."
5,"Great ,quick referance book to misbehaving children","This is a great book to read, and reference from, after reading PD for school age children. It isn't based on quick fixes, but long term results, and life style changes, that are geared to make a more functional and happy family. So far lots have been working, and others... still working on. But good concepts and helps teach parents how to make sure thier love shows through the discipline."
3,I recommend this as supplemental reading,"I bought this book because of the title & based on a recommendation from a friend. The book arrived in the mail and I immediately flipped open to the page about children biting (as my one year old was beginning to do). There were several aspects to their advice and some of those I agreed with & that have been effective. There was a lot that I thought was ridiculous & on a path to having an out of control, undisciplined child though. I would recommend this book to someone as supplemental reading for the ideas that you can mold into your framework for ""postive discipline""."
5,Good Book!,"This book is filled with tons of ideas on how to better discipline our children. Although I do not agree with everything contained in this book, I highly recommend it anyways because it contains really useful ideas about raising children.Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works: How to Get Motivated and Stay Motivated"
3,It's good movie,"After completing his studies in London, England, Shakti Thakur returns home to India in a small town where his family resides. Accompanying him is his leggy girlfriend, Anita, who he is in love with and wants to marry, much to the disapproval of his family.Gehna, who has given her heart to him years ago, hopes to marry him, with approval from his very own family. Anita returns to find that nothing is the same anymore, and that her role may be reduced to that of a mistress, she must now make a choice to either return back home, or fight and win back Shakti's love."
4,"A thing of beauty, a joy for a long time","This is a gorgeous looking piece that fits all the functions I needed it for: DVD player, CD player and photo CD viewer. Other than a little slowness upon starting and changing discs (this gets annoying quickly), I find it quiet and reliable. I have an Onkyo receiver, and I'm pleased that the component is compatible so I can use only one remote to control both. Even if you turn the player completely off, it remembers the last place you were at in the DVD. Another quibble -- the screen display of titles and such is quite small, so keep your glasses on. But overall, you'll be pleased with this investment."
1,This book is crap!,Poorly written and an bad story it was very disrespectful to Tibetans ! This is crap a total wast of time !!!
1,Do not be fooled by the product description,"Before you consider throwing away money on this atrocious ""film,"" knowthat the product description is most definitely misleading. Besides thefact that the film is in no way close to being a ""B-film"" as mentioned inthe product description, this film is not made by Irish or Scotsmen, butactually consists only of Texans. This movie has no real association withIrish or Scotsmen, and as for the acting it is merely reading lines at agrammar school comprehension level, and the movie would be improveddrastically if edited to be a black and white silent movie. Also, whileirresponsibly not mentioned anywhere about this product, it is by far notappropriate for children. Do not waste your money on this embarrassment,because all you will get is 2 hours and 20 minutes of homophobic jokes andfilm quality surpassed by high school AV club movies."
1,Just Plain Lame,"Take your $27 plus shipping and flush it down the toilet. Perhaps some good can come from the money that you would have wasted watching this rip off. I am not quite sure that Strangeheart technically qualifies as a movie per se. I have yet to see a middle school play that was so poorly crafted, written or acted. Drunk or not, what a pitiful excuse for a movie. Find something better to do with your time."
1,An unfortunate movie,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever watched. The acting, directing, cinematography and script were just bad. I got the impression the actors were trying to be the worst they could be.The video went into the waste basket as soon as it was over."
4,So happy to rediscover this classic!,"A friend shared this film with me years ago, but I couldn't remember the title until a recent screening at a local indie theater jogged my memory. I was stoked to find it on Amazon and relive the intensity. Definitely recommend to anyone interested in great cinematography, interesting character studies, and an insane plot."
2,The Universal Globe Is Chopped Off....Isn't That Proof?,"I've NEVER seen a Universal film where they cropped off the top of the spinning globe logo.This movie was needlessly cropped at the top and bottom, and it should be clear to anyone with a discerning eye.There is even a scene in which a key piece of evidence (the shoebox with dynamite in it) was visible in the fullscreen version, but not in this ""new"" version.This isn't an attack on all matting jobs, as some seem to think it is. But it is an attack on matting jobs done on films that weren't supposed to have them!!! Citizen Kane wasn't cropped, and I'm convinced this wasn't supposed to be either.A [bad] DVD for a film that deserves much better treatment."
2,Why butcher this film??????,"Why did the folks at Universal crop this movie into a fake ""letterbox"" format? The tops of actors heads are cut off in almost every scene! Why did they go through all the trouble to restore this film's original cut only to muck up the framing? I suppose some arrogant tech-guy somewhere crassly thinks people equate ""letterbox"" with ""importance.""...I cannot fathom this continued war against art. It's the audience that is cheated, and history that is robbed. STOP! We the consumers deserve better ... we pay your bills, Universal."
